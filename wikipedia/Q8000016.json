He has lived in Chippenham his whole life and began performing comedy in 2003. Prior to this he had worked part-time as a lecturer at Wiltshire College and had a stint training to be a wrestler during which he participated in 30-man \"Battle Royals\".Hodgson is known for his fast and almost monotone delivery which along with his bizarre persona has been known to divide audiences. He is also known for his bright pink hair (until recently, a mohican) and his love of 1980s girl's toys such as Care Bears and My Little Pony.Hodgson is also known for his material on women's bodies which he claims to be nature's greatest invention. He is vocal in his dislike of size zero models and airbrushed photos, expressing a preference for magazines such as Readers' Wives and for larger female celebrities such as Fern Britton and Liza Tarbuck.\nHodgson was a member of the Socialist Workers Party and the Anti Nazi League whilst a student at the University of Luton but claims to have no specific political allegiance besides his stance against racism, sexism and homophobia.\nHodgson's Edinburgh Festival shows have largely consisted of stand up material about his lifestyle and opinions combined with lengthy monologues about \"The Red Team\" a possibly fictional primary school sports day team made up of outcasts and misfits and their daily battles with the bullying \"Green Team\".\nHodgson's material tends towards autobiography rather than straight observation.\nIn 2004 he won a Perrier Award for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.He supported Ian Cognito on his national tour in 2005 and began his own national tour in January 2007. He supported Mark Thomas on some dates of his \"It's The Stupid Economy Tour\"\nIn December 2010, Hodgson filmed a cameo appearance in the independent feature film, What Happened After Macbeth directed by Jack Doyle which had been intended for release in 2013. The film also features cameos from stand-up comedians Seymour Mace and Des Sharples.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chippenham", "response": ["* Wil Hodgson, comedian, winner Perrier Best Newcomer 2004"]}, {"page": "Hodgson", "response": ["* Wil Hodgson (born 1978), English stand-up comedian"]}, {"page": "List of Edinburgh Comedy Award winners", "response": ["|Wil Hodgson \u2013 The Passion Of The Hodgson"]}, {"page": "28 Acts in 28 Minutes", "response": ["* Wil Hodgson"]}, {"page": "Corn Exchange, Newbury", "response": ["In the following years the festival has played host to Emo Philips, Jimmy Carr, Jo Brand, Russell Brand, Gervase Phinn, Simon Munnery, Lee Mack, Janet Street Porter, Jenny \u00c9clair, Alex Horne, Robin Ince, Rich Hall, Chris Addison, Alan Carr, Brendan Burns, Push - an Opera about Childbirth, Wil Hodgson, Laura Solon, Barry Cryer and more."]}, {"page": "Tilusha Ghelani", "response": ["*Wil Hodgson: Straight Outta Chippenham (pilot; BBC Radio 4, 2008)"]}, {"page": "Newbury Comedy Festival", "response": ["Acts who have appeared include Linda Smith, Emo Philips, Jimmy Carr, Alan Carr, Natalie Haynes, Al Murray, Rich Hall, Russell Brand, Barry Cryer, Laura Solon, Chris Addison, Howard Read, Janet Street Porter, Wil Hodgson, Jo Brand, Jenny Eclair, Gina Yashere, Sue Perkins, Susie Essman, Ardal O'Hanlon, Ed Byrne, Phill Jupitus and Josie Long."]}, {"page": "Chortle Awards", "response": ["* Award for innovation: Mark Watson for his Overambitious 24-Hour Show (nominees: Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players, Wil Hodgson)"]}, {"page": "4 Stands Up", "response": ["|3||26 Dec 2007||Shappi Khorsandi, Wil Hodgson and Rhod Gilbert"]}, {"page": "Russell Howard's Good News", "response": ["| 2 || 29 October 2009 ||  ||  ||  || Wil Hodgson"]}, {"page": "Cardiff Comedy Festival", "response": ["* Wil Hodgson"]}, {"page": "The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society", "response": ["* Wil Hodgson"]}, {"page": "2016 in stand-up comedy", "response": ["* September 15: Wil Hodgson's one-hour special Live on Bonfire Night is released on Go Faster Stripe.
