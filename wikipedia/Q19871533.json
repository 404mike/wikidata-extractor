Beguiled by the city, he stayed for fourteen months and completed approximately fifty etchings. Venice also inspired Whistler to make some hundred works in pastel, of which 53 were shown in the Venice Pastels exhibition in 1881.

Turner, and ran a subscription to pay for Ruskin's legal costs: a supreme exhibition of political sleight of hand.
