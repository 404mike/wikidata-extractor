He has special research interests in ethnomusicology and anthropology, as well as Middle Eastern popular music.\nStokes obtained his DPhil (PhD) from the University of Oxford (1989).  He currently studies music and music theory with a particular emphasis on the contemporary Middle East.  He returned to Oxford in 2007, having been at the University of Chicago, where he achieved the rank of Associate Professor of Ethnomusicology in the Department of Music, since 1997 and previously at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland.  He served as the Administrative Director of the Middle East Ensemble, Javanese Gamelan and the World Music Concert series during his tenure at the University of Chicago.  He also filled the role of Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago from 2003\u20132007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ethnomusicology", "response": ["Some ethnomusicological work focuses less on either Western or non-Western music specifically. For example, Martin Stokes' work regarding various aspects of identity addresses many cultures, both Western and non-Western.Stokes, Martin. 1994. Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place. Oxford: Berg. pp. 1-27 Stokes wrote about gender as it relates to music in various cultures, including Western, analyzing the fairly common phenomena of musicians seemingly presiding over events that are often related to issues of gender, or how a culture may seek to \"desex\" musicians as a form of control.Stokes, Martin. 1994. Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place. Oxford: Berg. p. 23 The insights that Stokes makes are not exclusive to any culture. Stokes also dedicates much of his writing on identity, nationality, and location to how this manifests in Western music. He notes the presence of Irish music in migrant communities in England and American as a way in which individuals locate themselves in the world.Stokes, Martin. 1994. Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place. Oxford: Berg. p. 3", "Martin Stokes uses his book Ethnicity, Identity and MusicStokes, Martin. 1994. Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place. Ethnomusicology Oxford: Berg. pp. 1-27. to examine how the presence of records, tapes, and CD's, and the ability to listen to music removed from its social setting affects identity and social boundaries. Stokes mentions how modernity and new technology has created a separation between place or \"locale\" (referring to the physical setting of social activity as situated geographically) and space (the location from where the music is being played and listened to.) Stokes calls the separation from space and place, \"relocation\" and refers to it as an \"anxiety ridden process.\" Stokes believes that music plays an essential role to how individuals \"relocate\" themselves, claiming that music is unmatched by any other social activity in its ability to evoke and organize collective memory. Stokes also claims that the presence of records, tapes and CD's creates the ability to present experiences of specific places \"with an intensity and power and simplicity unmatched.\" Stokes also touches upon the differences and social boundaries that each \"place\" holds. Claiming that each \"place\" organizes \"hierarchies of moral and political order\" and with each specific evocation of \"place,\" defines the moral and political community to relation to the space in which the listener finds themselves. The possibility of the instant evocation of musical \"place\" allows individuals to \"locate,\" and identify themselves in a plurality of ways, allowing a unique mix of places and social boundaries. Stokes also goes on to mention how the control of media systems by state-controlled governments, through ownership of its channels is a tool which authoritarian states use. Such control is not certain, as the meanings cannot be totally controlled and the citizens of said state can simply turn off the radio state or tune into another. Stokes believes the technological advancements in sound reproduction has democratized recording and listening, and thus, \"weakened the grip of state and music industry monopolies.\"", "The origins of music and its connections to identity have been debated throughout the history of ethnomusicology. Thomas Turino defines \"self,\" \"identity,\" and \"culture\" as patterns of habits, such that tendencies to respond to stimuli in particular ways repeat and reinscribe themselves.Turino, Thomas. 2008. Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. p. 95 Musical habits and our responses to them lead to cultural formations of identity and identity groups. For Martin Stokes, the function of music is to exercise collective power, creating barriers among groups. Thus, identity categories such as ethnicity and nationality are used to indicate oppositional content.Stokes, Martin. 1994. Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place. Oxford: Berg.", "In the latter half of the 19th century, song collectors motivated by the legacy of folkloric studies and musical nationalism in Southern and Eastern Europe collected folk songs for use in the construction of a pan-Slavic identity.Pegg, Carol., Bohlman, P. V., Myers, H., & Stokes, M, October 29, 2019.

Namely, Frederic Chopin gained international recognition as a composer of emblematic Polish music despite having no ancestral ties to the Polish peasantryStokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\"In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 14. Other composers such as B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Jean Sibelius, Edvard Grieg, and Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov utilized as well as contributed to the growing archives of recorded European folk songs to compose songs for the benefit of the nationalist governments of their respective countries. The French musicologist Radolphe d'Erlanger undertook a project of reviving older musical forms in Tunisia in order to reconstruct \"Oriental music,\" playing on instruments such as the ud and ghazal. Performing ensembles using such instruments were featured at the 1932 Congress of Arab Music in Cairo.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 15.", "Giving a strict definition to ethnicity is considered difficult by many scholars, but it can be best understood in terms of the creation and preservation of boundaries, in contrast to the social \"essences\" in the gaps between these boundaries.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 6. In fact, ethnic boundaries can both define and maintain social identities, and music can be used in local social situations by members of society to create such boundaries. The idea of authenticity becomes relevant here, where authenticity is not a property of the music or performance itself, but is a way of telling both insiders and outsiders that this is the music that makes one's society unique.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 7. Authenticity can also be seen as the idea that a certain music is inextricably bound to a certain group or physical place.Radano, Ronald Michael., et al. \"Introduction: Music and Race, Their Past, Their Presence.\" Music and the Racial Imagination, by Ronald Michael Radano and Philip Vilas Bohlman, University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 28. It can give insight into the question of the \"origin\" of music, in that it by definition bears connection to the geographical, historical, and cultural aspects of music. For instance, holding that particular aspects of African-American music are actually fundamentally African is critical to claims of authenticity in the global African diaspora.Radano, Ronald Michael., et al. \"Introduction: Music and Race, Their Past, Their Presence.\" Music and the Racial Imagination, by Ronald Michael Radano and Philip Vilas Bohlman, University of Chicago Press, 2001, pp. 28-29. In terms of how authenticity can be connected to the concept of place, consider the concept of authenticity in Jewish music throughout the Jewish diaspora. \"Jewish\" music is bound to both the Land of Israel and the ancient Temple of Jerusalem.Radano, Ronald Michael., et al. \"Introduction: Music and Race, Their Past, Their Presence.\" Music and the Racial Imagination, by Ronald Michael Radano and Philip Vilas Bohlman, University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 29.", "Although groups are self-defining in how they express the differences between self and other, colonization, domination, and violence within developing societies cannot be ignored.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. pp. 7-8. In a society, often dominant groups brutally oppress minority ethnicities from their classification systems. Music can be used as a tool to propagate dominant classifications in such societies, and has been used as such by new and developing states especially through control of media systems.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 10. Indeed, though music can help define a national identity, authoritarian states can control this musical identity through technology, in that they end up dictating what citizens can listen to.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 12. Governments often value music as a symbol, which can be used to promote supra-national entities.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 15. They often use this to argue the right to participate in or control a significant cultural or political event, such as Turkey's involvement in the Eurovision Song Contest.", "Historically, anthropologists have believed that ethnomusicologists deal with something that by definition cannot be synonymous with the social realities of the present world.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 1. In response, ethnomusicologists sometimes present a concept of society that purely exists within an all-encompassing definition of music. Ethnomusicologist Charles Seeger agrees with this, giving an example of how Suya society (in Brazil) can be understood in terms of its music. Seeger notes how \"Suya society was an orchestra, its village was a concert hall, and its year a song.\"Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 2.", "Music helps one understand oneself in relation to people, places, and times.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. P. 3. It informs one's sense of physical place\u2014a musical event (such as a collective dance) uniquely evokes collective memories and experiences of place. Both ethnomusicologists and anthropologists believe that music provides the means by which political and moral hierarchies are developed.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 4. Music allows people to comprehend both identities and physical places, as well as the boundaries that divide them.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 5.", "Gender is another area where boundaries are \"performed\" in music.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 21. Instruments and instrumental performance can contribute to a society's definition of gender, in that behaviour of performers conforms to the gender expectations of society (e.g. men should not display effort, or women should feign reluctance to perform).Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 22. Issues of ethnicity and music intersect with gender studies in fields like historical musicology, the study of popular music, and ethnomusicology. Indeed, gender can be seen as a symbol of social and political order, and controlling gender boundaries is thus a means of controlling such order. Gender boundaries reveal the most deeply intrinsic forms of domination in a society, that subsequently provide a template for other forms of domination. However, music can also provide a means of pushing back against these boundaries by blurring the boundary between what is traditionally considered male and female.", "When one listens to foreign music, one tries to make sense of it in terms of one's own (familiar) music and musical worldviews, and this internal struggle can be seen as a power struggle between one's musical views and the other, foreign ones.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 16. Sometimes, musicians celebrate ethnic plurality in problematic ways, in that they collect genres, and subsequently alter and reinterpret them in their own terms. Societies often publicize so-called multi-cultural music performances simply for the promotion of their own self-image. Such staged folklore begins to greatly diverge from the celebration of ethnic plurality it purportedly represents, and the music and dance being performed become meaningless when presented so entirely out of context. In such a scenario, which is seen very commonly, the meaning of the performance is both created and controlled by the performers, the audience, and even the media of the society the performance takes place in.", "Music rarely remains stable in contexts of social change -- \"culture contact\" causes music to be altered to whatever new culture it has come in contact with.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 17. In this way, minority communities can internalize the outside world through music\u2014a kind of sense-making. They become able to deal with and control a foreign world on their own (musical) terms. Indeed, such integration of musical difference is an integral aspect of the creation of a musical identity, which can be seen in Seeger's description of the Brazilian Suya, who took music from an outside culture and made it their own as an \"assertion of identity in a multi-ethnic social situation.\" In addition, consider the development of East Indian culture. Many of the trademarks of East Indian society, such as the caste system and the Bhojpuri form of the Hindi language, are becoming obsolete, which erodes their concept of ethnic identity.Manuel, Peter. \"Ethnic Identity, National Identity, and Music in Indo-Trinidadian Culture.\" Music and the Racial Imagination, by Ronald Michael Radano and Philip Vilas Bohlman, University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 318. In light of these conditions, music has begun to play an unprecedented role in the concept of East Indian ethnic identity Music can also play a transformative part in the formation of the identities of urban and migrant communities, which can be seen in the diverse and distinct musical cultures in the melting pot of communities in the US.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 18. In the case of colonialism, the colonizer and the colonized end up repeatedly exchanging musical ideas.Radano, Ronald Michael., et al. \"Introduction: Music and Race, Their Past, Their Presence.\" Music and the Racial Imagination, by Ronald Michael Radano and Philip Vilas Bohlman, University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 30. For instance, in the Spanish colonization of the indigenous Native Americans, the resulting mestizo music reflects the intersection of these two culture spheres, and even gave way to new modes of musical expression bearing aspects of both cultures.", "However, one cannot simply match a class with a single musical style, as musical styles reflect the complex and often contradictory aspects of the society as a whole.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 19. Marxist subcultural theory proposes that subcultures borrow and alter traits from the dominant culture to create a newly diverse range of available traits where the signs of the dominant culture remain, but are now part of a new and simultaneously subversive whole. In fact, ethnicities are similar to classes in many ways. They are often either defined or excluded based on the rules of the dominant classificatory system of the society.Stokes, Martin. 1994. \"Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.\" In Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place, 1-22. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. p. 20. Thus, ethnic minorities are forced to figure out how to create their own identities within the control of the dominant classifications. Ethnic minorities can also use music in order to resist and protest the dominant group. This can be seen in European Jews, African Americans, Malaysian-Chinese, and even in the Indonesian-Chinese, who expressed resistance through Chinese theater performances.Kartomi, Margaret J. \"Indonesian-Chinese Oppression and the Musical Outcomes in the Netherlands East Indies.\" Music and the Racial Imagination, by Ronald Michael Radano and Philip Vilas Bohlman, University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 309."]}, {"page": "Martin stokes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martin Stokes "]}, {"page": "Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago", "response": ["* Martin Stokes: 2004-2007"]}, {"page": "Stokes (surname)", "response": ["*Martin Stokes, British academic"]}, {"page": "King's College London Faculty of Arts and Humanities", "response": ["* Martin Stokes, King Edward Professor of Music"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2010s", "response": ["* Martin Stokes, Professor of Music, University of Oxford "]}, {"page": "King Edward Professor of Music", "response": ["* 2013\u2013present: Martin Stokes, FBA.\"Stokes, Prof. Martin\", Who's Who (online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2018).
