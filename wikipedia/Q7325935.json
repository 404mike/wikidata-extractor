He represented Oxford University and Hampshire as a left-handed batsman and very occasional leg-break bowler in 269 first-class matches (1964\u20131978) and 165 List A matches (1968\u20131978).\nHis most successful season with the bat was 1969, when he scored the fastest century of the County Championship season (against Essex at Ilford), his highest score (223 not out against Warwickshire at Southampton), and finished with 1386 runs at 39.60, including six centuries.\nAfter succeeding Roy Marshall as County Captain of Hampshire (1971\u20131978), he led the 1st XI to the 1973 County Championship. He also served as Assistant Secretary under Desmond Eagar.\nAfter his cricket career he returned to Charterhouse as a teacher and housemaster. Following his effective stewardship as housemaster, he was appointed Second Master in 1996 and held this position until his retirement in summer 2004. His uncle, Ivor Gilliat, also played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Again, however, Hampshire were disappointing until Barry Richards joined the county in 1968, when they rose from tenth to fifth in the Championship and established themselves as a power in limited-overs cricket. Bob Cottam was the second-highest first-class wicket-taker in 1968 and the highest in 1969, but did not maintain this excellence before joining Northamptonshire and in 1970 and 1971 Hampshire fell to mid-table. In the 1973 County Championship Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time, winning the competition by 31 points from Surrey. The club won 10 of their 20 matches and drew the other 10. During this season they were led by Richard Gilliat with Gordon Greenidge scoring the most runs for the club with 1,620. Bob Herman and Mike Taylor both took 63 wickets. This remains Hampshire's last success in the tournament.  In 1979 West Indian Malcolm Marshall, widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to grace the game joined the club. This was to be the start of a 14-year stay with the club. During that time Marshall would go on to take 824 first-class wickets at an average of 18.64 and 239 wickets at 24.88 in one-day cricket. 1984 also saw the last game of Venezuelan captain Nick Pocock (Maracaibo, 1951) and the arrival of another West Indian, Cardigan Connor who would spend 14 years with the club. Regarded as one of the best players not to play Test cricket, Connor took 614 first-class wickets for Hampshire at an average of 31.74 and 411 wickets at 25.07 in one-day cricket.  In 1985 Hampshire finished second in the County Championship, finishing 18 points behind winners Middlesex. Chris Smith led the way with the bat, scoring 1,720 runs. and was well backed up by the bowling of Malcolm Marshall who took 95 wickets at the impressive average of 17.68.  Later in, 1988 the club won the Benson & Hedges Cup by beating Derbyshire by 7 wickets at Lord's, largely thanks to a five wicket haul by Stephen Jefferies. The 1990s brought about further success in the first half of the decade, and later struggles in the latter half. In the 1991 County Championship season Hampshire won the NatWest Trophy, defeating Surrey by 4 wickets, with Shaun Udal claiming the man of the match award. This was the clubs first one day honour in this competition. Hampshire again repeated their 1988 success in the Benson & Hedges Cup by winning the 1992 competition. In the final at Lord's they beat Kent by 41 runs, including 90 runs from Robin Smith and three wickets each from Malcolm Marshall and Shaun Udal.  This marked Hampshire's second success in the competition. In 1996 Malcolm Marshall returned to coach the club. In 1997 work begun on Hampshire's long-awaited new ground. The realisation of this move almost led the club to financial ruin, as encouragement from financial partners Sport England and the hiring of architect Sir Michael Hopkins had led the then part-time voluntary committee running the club to lose control of the budget."]}, {"page": "Reed's School", "response": ["*Richard Gilliat, former head of admissions and Hampshire cricketer, retired in 2017"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Richard Gilliat (born 1944), English cricketer who played 269 first-class matches"]}, {"page": "Bob Stephenson (sportsman)", "response": ["Stephenson continued to serve Hampshire through the inconsistent times of the mid-70s, the highlight being the team's second-ever victory in the County Championship in 1973.

An infrequent performer for Devon due to his naval commitments meant he was limited to just 28 appearances for the county between 1959 and 1975, playing his final match for them against the Somerset Second XI. He played just one first-class match, which came for the Combined Services against Oxford University. In the Oxford University first-innings he took his only 2 first-class wickets, those of Maurice Manasseh and Richard Gilliat, for the cost of 36 runs. With the bat he scored 3 runs in the Combined Services first-innings before being dismissed by John Martin and in their second-innings he scored 31 runs, being dismissed this time by Andrew Barker."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Richard Gilliat (1968\u20131976) : R.

By profession, Gilliat became a schoolmaster after graduating from Oxford, becoming a master at Bradfield College and later Radley College. While at Charterhouse, he had been a member of the Charterhouse School Officers' Training Corps and in May 1927 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Territorial Army. Gilliat served with the Royal Berkshire Regiment during the Second World War and was promoted to lieutenant in July 1940. He was made an MBE in the 1946 New Year Honours. Upon exceeding the age for recall in June 1953, he was removed from the Reserve of Officers' and was granted the honorary rank of major. Gilliat died at Oxford in July 1967. His nephew Richard Gilliat and brother-in-law John Leslie both played first-class cricket."]}]}}
