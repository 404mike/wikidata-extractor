She established significant milestones for female officials in professional cue sports, beginning in pool, where she officiated at top tournaments such as the WPA World Nine-ball Championship and the Mosconi Cup. She qualified in 2001 to referee on the World Snooker Tour and went on to become the sport's highest profile female referee, officiating on tour for 14 years. She became the first woman to officiate at a professional ranking snooker tournament at the 2002 Welsh Open, and the first woman to referee a ranking tournament final at the 2007 Welsh Open. As of 2021, she is the only woman ever to referee the World Snooker Championship final, which she did in both 2009 and 2012.\nHer professional snooker refereeing career came to an end when she left the tour in March 2015. She subsequently brought a court case against the sport's governing body, alleging sex discrimination, unfair dismissal, and breach of contract. An out-of-court settlement was reached in September 2015, under which Tabb was paid an undisclosed sum. In addition to her refereeing career, Tabb is also a former player on the women's eight-ball pool circuit, where she won a number of titles as a solo competitor and as a member, and later captain, of the Scottish Ladies' team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fife", "response": ["* Michaela Tabb, first female snooker referee to appear at the Crucible"]}, {"page": "World Snooker Championship", "response": ["John Higgins won his third world title in 2009, beating Shaun Murphy 18\u20139 in the final.

In response, Davis made use of his entitlement to take a break in the match. (Davis admitted later that the timing of this was intentional, leaving Strickland to the mercy of the crowd.) During the gap, Strickland put his fingers in his ears to block out the crowd's support for Davis, to the derision of the crowd, who mocked the gesture, and cheered loudly for Davis whenever Strickland took his fingers out. Late in the match, he responded to Davis' missing of an easy shot by sharply leaping out of his chair, fists aloft, shouting to the crowd \"Yeah! He dogged it!\" When Davis took a second break, Strickland loudly complained that players were only entitled to a single break, telling the crowd \"He's Steve Davis, he can do what he likes,\" another reference to his belief that Davis's status at Matchroom Sport afforded him special treatment.", "At the 2006 Mosconi Cup, which took place at Rotterdam, Netherlands between December 7 and 10, the audience was loud, cheering and blowing horns when rooting for Team Europe.
