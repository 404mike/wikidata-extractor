Gill was born in Melbourne Australia and worked at Cambridge, serving as Senior Research Fellow from 1963 to 1984 [2]. His father was Edmund Gill, geologist, palaeontologist and curator at the National Museum of Victoria.\nGill was chair of the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere program. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1986. His candidacy citation read: \"Dr A. E. Gill is internationally recognised for his work in geophysical fluid dynamics and leads a small but highly productive team working on problems in dynamical oceanography and meteorology. He has made outstanding theoretical contributions to a wide range of topics, including the stability of pipe flow, thermal convection, circulation of the Southern Ocean, seasonal variability of the ocean, waves in rotating fluids, wind-induced upwelling, coastal currents and sea-level changes and coastally-trapped waves in the atmosphere, and he is particularly effective in the way he is able to interpret observations and guide the activities of observational workers\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gill (name)", "response": ["*Adrian Gill (1937\u20131986), Australian meteorologist and oceanographer"]}, {"page": "Kirk Bryan (oceanographer)", "response": ["In addition to his important contributions in developing numerical codes, Bryan was also involved in early efforts to apply them to understanding the global climate system. In 1967, he published, with Michael Cox, the first model of the 3-dimensional circulation of the ocean, forced by both winds and thermodynamic forcing.  In 1969, a paper with Syukoro Manabe was the first to present integrations of a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model, demonstrating the importance of ocean heat transport to the climate. This work was recently named one of the top ten breakthroughs in the history of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Bryan's 1971 paper with the noted dynamicist Adrian Gill demonstrated the important role played by bottom topography in setting the structure of the global ocean circulation, and played a major role in suggesting links between changes in continental topography and climate, continuing a long-term interest in the role of oceanic heat transport in determining global climate.
