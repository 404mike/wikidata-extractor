He also had lunch with King George VI. Donovan and Churchill got along famously, sharing war stories and reciting in unison the nineteenth-century poem \"The Cavalier's Song\" by William Motherwell. Impressed by Donovan and cheered by his eagerness to help Britain, Churchill ordered that he be given unlimited access to classified information. Donovan returned to the U.S. confident of Britain's chances and enamored of the possibility of founding an American intelligence service modeled on that of the British. He strongly urged Roosevelt to give Churchill the aid he requested. Roosevelt wanted to provide such aid, and asked Donovan to use his knowledge of the law to figure out how to skirt the congressional ban on selling armaments to the United Kingdom."]}, {"page": "Crookston Castle", "response": ["The poets Robert Burns, William Motherwell and Robert Tannahill have all mentioned the castle in their works, while Sir Walter Scott, in his 1820 novel The Abbot, suggested Mary, Queen of Scots, watched the Battle of Langside from beneath its yew tree, although the topography makes this impossible.Lindsay, p.178"]}, {"page": "Scottish music (1500\u20131899)", "response": ["* 1827 \"Minstrelsy Ancient and Modern\" by William Motherwell (1797\u20131835)"]}, {"page": "English folk music (1500\u20131899)", "response": ["* 1827: Minstrelsy Ancient and Modern, published by William Motherwell (1797\u20131835)"]}, {"page": "Robert Sempill", "response": ["See Chronicle of Scottish Poetry (ed.

James Hogg was one of those who responded to this shifting of the market by trying to surpass the imitations of ancient ballads in its third volume.  One of the consequences of Scott's use of the phrase Scottish Border in his title, in spite of the fact that many of his ballads came from north-east Scotland, was to popularize the still current fallacy that the Borders rather than the north-east were the richest source of Scottish ballads.  Most ballad editors of the 19th century and later, such as William Motherwell and Francis James Child, practised strict fidelity to one source, but Scott's example of preferring collation was followed by some of his successors, and can be seen in William Allingham's Ballad Book, Arthur Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book of Ballads, and Robert Graves's The English Ballad and English and Scottish Ballads."]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["William Motherwellnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "1835 in poetry", "response": ["* November 1 \u2013 William Motherwell, Scottish poet (born 1797)"]}, {"page": "1797 in poetry", "response": ["* October 13 \u2013 William Motherwell (died 1835), Scottish"]}, {"page": "1797 in Great Britain", "response": ["** William Motherwell, Scottish poet, antiquary and journalist (died 1835)"]}, {"page": "Motherwell (disambiguation)", "response": ["* William Motherwell (1797-1835), a Scottish poet"]}, {"page": "List of books for the \"Famous Scots Series\"", "response": ["|Also included are short biographies of the poets Robert Tannahill, William Motherwell, and William Thom"]}, {"page": "1846 in Scotland", "response": ["* William Motherwell's Poetical Works are published posthumously."]}, {"page": "Robert Archibald Smith", "response": ["In 1826 Smith published a practical manual, Introduction to Singing.
