The son of a Church of England priest, he also served as Bishop of Rochester. It was in that role that he travelled throughout North America and met with  leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While he wrote a number of devotional books, he is best remembered for having recruited Isabella Gilmore to revive the female diaconate in the Anglican Communion.", "In 1886, he recruited Isabella Gilmore to revive the female diaconate in his diocese. Her initial reluctance, based on her lack of theological training and her lack of knowledge of the deaconess order, was worn down by Thorold. At the end of October 1886, she felt she received a calling during Morning Prayer. She later wrote, \"it was just as if God's voice had called me, and the intense rest and joy were beyond words.\" Gilmore and Bishop Thorold proceeded to plan for an order of deaconesses for the Church of England where the women were to be \"a curiously effective combination of nurse, social worker and amateur policemen\". In 1887, Gilmore was ordained a deaconess and a training house for other woman was put in place, later to be named Gilmore House in her honour. In her nearly 20 years of service, she re-established the female diaconate in the Anglican Communion."]}, {"page": "Calendar of saints (Church of England)", "response": ["*16    Isabella Gilmore, Deaconess, 1923"]}, {"page": "Saints in Anglicanism", "response": ["*Isabella Gilmore (1842\u20131923), deaconess"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Ferard", "response": ["Isabella Gilmore (1842\u20131923), in the diocese of Rochester led an alternate style of deaconess life for she preferred a more parish-based model. The deaconess movement spread worldwide, to many American cities as well as South Africa, China, New Zealand and the Philippines, among other places. A similar secular and slightly later institution was Hull House, for which Jane Addams (1860\u20131935) won a Nobel Peace prize."]}]}}
