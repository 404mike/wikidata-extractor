New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in brutalist style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.alt=|thumb|192x192px|Fa\u00e7ade of the Sir Duncan Rice Library in Old Aberdeen", "During the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum (Marischal College has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a \u00a357 million new university library (the Sir Duncan Rice Library) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012. Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King's College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.", "The most recent building on campus is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011 and designed by Danish architects Schmidt Hammer Lassen.

It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors. In addition to expanded facilities it also houses public exhibition space and the university's historic collections, comprising more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts collected over five centuries since the university's foundations. Other libraries are in the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences).

It was designed by the Danish architectural firm Schmidt Hammer Lassen at the cost of \u00a357 million. The building sits on a base of Scottish stone. The ground floor is double-height with seven floors above. The building is clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass. In the interior void spaces are located centrally. Contrasting with the geometric exterior, the central atrium formed by the void spaces has an organic form, shifting in location across the levels. It has won numerous awards for its architecture."]}, {"page": "Dollar Academy", "response": ["*2007 Professor Duncan Rice, Principal of the University of Aberdeen"]}, {"page": "List of Hamilton College people", "response": ["* Duncan Rice - Principal of the University of Aberdeen; former Vice-Chancellor of New York University"]}, {"page": "Sabhal M\u00f2r Lectures", "response": ["#(2005) Duncan Rice (Principal and Vice-Chancellor of Aberdeen University) "]}, {"page": "2009 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Prof Charles Duncan Rice, Principal and Vice-Chancellor, University of Aberdeen.
