The son of a miller, he became a well-to-do flour trader in England before emigrating to Calgary, Alberta. There he bred horses and then dairy cattle, became president of the United Farmers of Alberta and the Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company, founded a brick factory and a business directory and was active in local politics.

In fact, UFA President William John Tregillus had included the idea in a speech he gave on his goals for the organization in 1913.Grain Growers Guide, January 29, 1913, p. 27) At the UFA convention in 1923, a proponent of a provincial banking, George Bevington, made a passionate speech in favour of this idea, bringing most of the membership around to his side.Foster, John E. Brownlee: A Biography, 90  The convention passed a resolution in favour of the idea (along with one calling on the provincial treasury to establish a loan department, an idea that came to fruition fifteen years later with the creation of Alberta Treasury Branches),Finkel 46 against the stiff opposition of Attorney-General Brownlee.  Brownlee's opposition stemmed in part from investigations that Greenfield's government had already undertaken into the subject: information was gathered from similar experiments in New Zealand and New South Wales, leading to the conclusion that, while there would be some benefit to a provincially owned bank, Alberta \"had neither the economic nor constitutional base to consider such a scheme\".Foster, John E. Brownlee: A Biography, 93  This conclusion was affirmed by University of Alberta professor D. A. MacGibbon in a government-commissioned study."]}, {"page": "United Farmers of Alberta", "response": ["UFA was founded in 1909 as a government lobby group following a merger between the Alberta Farmers' Association and Alberta branches of the Canadian Society for Equity.

In 1913, under president William John Tregillus, the UFA successfully pressured Alberta's Liberal government to organize the Alberta Farmers' Cooperative Elevator Company (AFCEC), which joined with other Prairie elevator companies to eventually become the United Grain Growers."]}, {"page": "Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company", "response": ["The first president was William John Tregillus (1858\u20131914), a rancher and businessman who had been elected president of the United Farmers of Alberta in 1912, and continued to serve in this role while president of the AFCEC.
