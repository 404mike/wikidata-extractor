He said, \"I don't object to Jones excising minor characters or altering the story's structure: that inevitably happens when you turn a novel into a musical. What I find objectionable is that, in trying to give the story a modern spin and show all Victorian women as social victims, she actually deprives Marian of much of her odd, independent quirkiness that makes her one of the most original characters in fiction.\"Billington, Michael. \"The Woman in White, Palace Theatre, London\" The Guardian, 16 September 2004 Some critics noted the show's set design, which employed the innovative use of projections rather than traditional scenery.
