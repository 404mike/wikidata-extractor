The Moffatts extended the castle, including building new stables in the same style as the original property. During the Second World War the castle was used by Felsted School, which was evacuated from Essex to the area. The broadcaster Kenneth Kendall recalled life at the court during the evacuation; \"The house was furnished with amazing furniture and paintings (with) armour everywhere.  I remember one boy got struck inside a Jacobean helmet and had to be rescued by the headmaster.\" When the school relocated at the end of the war the court was stripped of its fittings in 1946 and demolished in 1949.  The Monmouth Gate, on the road to Ross-on-Wye, is the only significant surviving remnant of the court."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1857\u20131868)", "response": ["|George Moffatt"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|George Moffatt"]}]}}
