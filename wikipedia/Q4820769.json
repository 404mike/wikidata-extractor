After serving as a military bandmaster in Germany, he moved to England and soon became director of music at London's Crystal Palace. He increased the resident band to full symphonic strength and for more than forty years conducted concerts at popular prices. He introduced a wide range of music to London, including many works by young British composers, as well as works by German masters hitherto neglected in England. Among his British prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were Arthur Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford, Hubert Parry, Hamish MacCunn, Edward Elgar and Edward German.\nManns performed the works of more than 300 composers, and was reckoned to have given more than 12,000 concerts during his tenure at the Crystal Palace, between 1855 and 1901. He became a British citizen in 1894 and was knighted in 1903.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Elgar", "response": ["Elgar took full advantage of the opportunity to hear unfamiliar music.

Retrieved 23 October 2010   Elgar took every chance to do so at the Crystal Palace concerts. He and Alice attended day after day, hearing music by a wide range of composers. Among these were masters of orchestration from whom he learned much, such as Berlioz and Richard Wagner. His own compositions made little impact on London's musical scene. August Manns conducted Elgar's orchestral version of Salut d'amour and the Suite in D at the Crystal Palace, and two publishers accepted some of Elgar's violin pieces, organ voluntaries, and part songs.Reed, p. 23 Some tantalising opportunities seemed to be within reach but vanished unexpectedly. For example, an offer from the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, to run through some of his works was withdrawn at the last second when Sir Arthur Sullivan arrived unannounced to rehearse some of his own music. Sullivan was horrified when Elgar later told him what had happened. Elgar's only important commission while in London came from his home city: the Worcester Festival Committee invited him to compose a short orchestral work for the 1890 Three Choirs Festival.Reed, p. 25 The result is described by Diana McVeagh in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, as \"his first major work, the assured and uninhibited Froissart.\" Elgar conducted the first performance in Worcester in September 1890. For lack of other work, he was obliged to leave London in 1891 and return with his wife and child to Worcestershire, where he could earn a living conducting local musical ensembles and teaching.

Several musicologists, including David Brown and Francis Maes, consider this name a faux pas. Western listeners, conditioned by Chopin's use of the polonaise as a symbol of Polish independence, interpreted Tchaikovsky's use of the same dance likewise; actually, in Tsarist Russia it was musical code for the Romanov dynasty and, by extension, Russian imperialism.", "The British premiere of the Third Symphony was led by Sir August Manns at the Crystal Palace in London in 1899. Manns dubbed the work with the sobriquet Polish at that time.", "Western critics and audiences began calling this symphony the Polish after Sir August Manns led the first British performance in 1899, with the finale seen as an expression by the Polish people for their liberation from Russian domination and the reinstatement of their independence. Since this was the way Chopin had treated the dance in his works and people had heard them in that light for at least a generation, their interpretation of the finale of the Third Symphony in a similar manner was completely understandable.

George Gouraud on Edison's yellow paraffin cylinder. The limitations of recording technology at that time, together with the number of voices, the distance of the recording device from the singers and the acoustics of the Crystal Palace, mean that the recorded sound was dim to begin with, and it has since then become badly degraded.

Alas, where are the snows of yester-year? The only one who in any degree justified his own hopes was Thomas Wingham - and he is dead. I should imagine it is not known to many what a mountain of manuscripts he has left behind. Who, for instance, has heard his Choral Symphony? And who, again, knows much about his opera \"Nala and Damayanti\"? Has it ever been orchestrated? Wingham's career as a composer furnishes much food for reflection, and should be taken to heart by all young students who are today looking with eager eyes into the future, where they see visions of glory and worldly reward. He was a man of exquisitely delicate fancy, his melodic gift was distinguished, his learning was deep, the modern orchestra had no secrets for him, and his ideals were lofty. Now he was planning a symphony, now a quartet, now a concerto, or again an opera. The Philharmonic Concerts were open to him, and Mr. Manns (August Manns) was a staunch friend and admirer. Granting his genius, he should by rights have been one of the glories of musical England. Why has he fallen short of that? I venture to think because he got into the whirlpool of teaching and examining which devours so many of our brightest talents. His responsibilities were onerous, and as he was a man of honour he shirked none of them. Two paths lay open to him: either to live for his art or to live for his duties. He chose the latter, and among his friends and those who were dependent on him his memory will be all the sweeter for his choice; but I think his own artistic development was hindered thereby, and I am sure the world is the loser. Social life in England absorbs artistic life and - bitter as it is to say - it seems almost impossible to be at the same time a great artist and a good citizen, unless one has independent means or scorns delights and lives laborious days.
