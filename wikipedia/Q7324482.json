The availability of the articles online brought a large American audience to the site. In 1997, the Clinton administration issued a 331-page report that accused Evans-Pritchard of peddling \"right-wing inventions\". Derek Bishton, who by then had succeeded Rooney as editor, later wrote: \"In the days before ET it would have been highly unlikely that anyone in the US would have been aware of Evans-Pritchard's work \u2013 and certainly not to the extent that the White House would be forced to issue such a lengthy rebuttal.\" Bishton, who later became consulting editor for Telegraph Media Group, was followed as editor by Richard Burton, who was made redundant in August 2006. Edward Roussel replaced Burton."]}]}}
