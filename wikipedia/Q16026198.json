He was the member for Bogong from May 1892 until May 1893 and between June 1893 and May 1901. In 1893 he became Solicitor-General in the Patterson ministry.  From 1894 to 1899 he was Attorney-General in the Turner ministry, and served as acting Premier on some occasions. In 1897 he was elected to the convention to approve the terms of the Australian Constitution.  However, he was not elected to the committee drafting the constitution; Alfred Deakin attributed this failure to \"a plot discreditable to all engaged in it\" and thought that this antagonizing and humiliating snub sharpened Isaacs's \"tendency to minute technical criticism ... so as to bring him not infrequently into collision\" with the committee. Isaacs had many reservations about the draft constitution, but he campaigned in support of it after the Australian Natives' Association gave the draft its full support, rejecting his plea to delay for further consideration.Sir Isaac Isaacs, Contribution and significance of an individual in the 1930s, Australia between the wars: 1930s, History Year 9, NSW | Online Education Home Schooling Skwirk Australia .

He remained active in various causes for another decade and wrote frequently on matters of constitutional law. In the 1940s he became embroiled in controversy with the Jewish community both in Australia and internationally through his outspoken opposition to Zionism. His principal critic was Julius Stone.Julius Stone, \"Stand up and be counted!\" An open letter to the Rt Hon Sir Isaac Isaacs on the occasion of the 26th anniversary of the Jewish National Home, 1944. Isaacs was supported by Rabbi Jacob Danglow (1880\u20131962) and Harold Boas. Isaacs insisted that Judaism was a religious identity and not a national or ethnic one. He opposed the notion of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Isaacs said \"[p]olitical Zionism to which I am irrevocably opposed for the reasons which will be found clearly stated, must be sharply distinguished from religious and cultural Zionism to which I am strongly attached.\"", "* National Library of Australia: Papers of Sir Isaac Isaacs"]}, {"page": "Charles Moore and Co.", "response": ["In 1914 he opened a new palatial store on the west side of Victoria Square between Grote and Gouger Streets, designed by architects Garlick & Jackman. No expense was spared in providing a maximum of display area behind large plate glass windows, generously lit by a huge leadlight cupola and extensive artificial lighting. A feature was a grand marble staircase leading to the first floor.In the US this would be reckoned the second floor. The store was officially opened by the Mayor of Adelaide, Isaac Isaacs, on 29 August 1916."]}]}}
