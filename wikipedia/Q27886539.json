He trained in paediatrics under the mentorship of James Holmes Hutchison, and was eventually appointed a consultant at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. He quickly developed an interest in nephrology and in 1950 he established a paediatric renal unit at Royal Hospital for Sick Children. This was the first specialised unit for children's kidney disease in Britain, and one of the first in Europe. Arneil's unit pioneered the use of cortisone, prednisolone and thiazides in paediatric renal conditions as well as the use of peritoneal dialysis in children with acute kidney injury."]}]}}
