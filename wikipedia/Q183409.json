Many MK members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to Mandela's whereabouts, although Mandela himself gave these ideas little credence. In later years, Donald Rickard, a former American diplomat revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency, who feared Mandela's associations with communists, had informed the South African police of his location. Jailed in Johannesburg's Marshall Square prison, Mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. Representing himself with Slovo as legal advisor, Mandela intended to use the trial to showcase \"the ANC's moral opposition to racism\" while supporters demonstrated outside the court. Moved to Pretoria, where Winnie could visit him, he began correspondence studies for a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of London International Programmes. His hearing began in October, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional kaross, refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang \"Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika\"."]}, {"page": "Winnie Mandela (film)", "response": ["*John Whiteley as Cecil Williams"]}, {"page": "Cecil Williams", "response": ["Cecil Williams may refer to:", "* Cecil Williams (anti-apartheid activist) (1909\u20131979), English-South African theatre director and anti-apartheid activist", "* Cecil Williams (cricketer) (1926\u20131998), Barbadian cricketer and diplomat", "* Cecil Williams (pastor) (born 1929), pastor, community leader and author"]}]}}
