These artists are all associated with The Edinburgh School.\nAssisted by a Carnegie travelling scholarship, together with Geissler and Gillies, Crozier studied under the cubist painter Andr\u00e9 Lhote in Paris in 1923. In 1924 the three talented young painters pursued their journey to Italy, where Crozier was particularly taken by the bright sunlight and resultant deep shadows, a quality which he later sought to capture in his work. This aspect of his painting and the cubist influences are evident in his 1927 painting,  Edinburgh (from Salisbury Crags). The buildings are represented as simple geometric blocks with intense contrast between the sunlit facades and heavily shaded sides.Crozier suffered from haemophilia and was affected by ill health for most of his life. He died aged only 37 after a fall in his studio.
