While he scored just two runs in the first innings of the game and four in the second, his bowling figures of 1-6 from seven overs were economical, and his only first-class wicket was that of 50-year-old former Test cricketer Jack Hobbs, though Hobbs had made 117 by the time he was out.Alston was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler.\nIn the Second World War, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Somerset Light Infantry. While on service, he played a non-first-class war-time cricket match for the Combined Services cricket team at Hull and took five London Counties wickets for 31 runs with his off-spin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Granny", "response": ["* Granny Alston or Hallam Newton Egerton Alston (1908\u20131985), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Granny Alston (1933) 1 match CA"]}]}}
