He appeared in more than 60 films between 1919 and 1933. He also produced 19 films between 1931 and 1958. He was born in St. Ives, Cornwall.Ward was a popular leading man in silent films of the 1920s, although he also played villains. Ward cultivated a debonair but forceful air in his films. Having made his breakthrough in British productions, the Slump of 1924 dramatically reduced the number of British films being made. Ward increasingly appeared in Continental productions, particularly German films. His career gradually tailed-off with the arrival of sound film and he began a second career as a film producer. He was an important figure at Associated British and appears in the studio's Elstree Story (1952).", "link_mentions": {}}}
