He appeared in more than 60 films between 1919 and 1933. He also produced 19 films between 1931 and 1958. He was born in St. Ives, Cornwall.Ward was a popular leading man in silent films of the 1920s, although he also played villains. Ward cultivated a debonair but forceful air in his films. Having made his breakthrough in British productions, the Slump of 1924 dramatically reduced the number of British films being made. Ward increasingly appeared in Continental productions, particularly German films. His career gradually tailed-off with the arrival of sound film and he began a second career as a film producer. He was an important figure at Associated British and appears in the studio's Elstree Story (1952).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Ives, Cornwall", "response": ["* Warwick Ward (1891 in St Ives \u2013 1967) English actor and film producer, appearing in 64 films between 1919 and 1933 and produced 19 films between 1931 and 1958"]}, {"page": "1929 in film", "response": ["*After the Verdict, directed by Henrik Galeen, starring Olga Chekhova and Warwick Ward \u2013 (GB)"]}, {"page": "1928 in film", "response": ["*Maria Marten, starring Trilby Clark and Warwick Ward (Britain)"]}, {"page": "Bulldog Drummond (1922 film)", "response": ["* Warwick Ward as Dr. Lakington"]}, {"page": "Pola Negri", "response": ["| Co-stars: Hans Rehmann, Warwick WardAlternate Titles: The Way of Lost Souls, Street of Abandoned ChildrenSilent film with soundtrack.
