In that season, he passed 1,000 runs for the first time at an average of over 40 runs per innings and made the first of what would be 24 first-class centuries. He passed 1,000 runs in each of the next three seasons, but in 1985, he was moved up the batting order to No 4 and his batting moved up a notch. He made 1,644 runs at an average of more than 56 runs per innings as Gloucestershire rose from the bottom of the County Championship table to challenge for the title. Bainbridge was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1986, but he had a less successful season and talk of him as a potential Test player subsided.\nAfter four more years, Bainbridge retired from Gloucestershire after the 1990 season to go into business, and became involved in the marketing side of the development of Durham as a first-class county. Having missed the entire 1991 season, he played in most of Durham's first-class games in their two inaugural seasons and he topped both batting and bowling averages in 1993. He was then made captain for 1994, and the side finished 16th, the first time it had not been bottom in the County Championship. But Bainbridge's own form suffered, and he was replaced as captain for 1995 and retired finally from first-class cricket the following year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Phil Bainbridge"]}, {"page": "1985 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden - Phil Bainbridge, Richard Ellison, Craig McDermott, Neal Radford, Tim Robinson"]}, {"page": "Mitchell High School, Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["* Phil Bainbridge, former professional cricketer Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and Durham County Cricket Club"]}, {"page": "Sneyd Green", "response": ["*Phil Bainbridge \u2013 Cricketer."]}, {"page": "List of Durham List A cricket records", "response": ["| 4th || 166 ||  Stewart Hutton Phil Bainbridge || v Wiltshire || Trowbridge || 1993"]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Phil Bainbridge 2/56"]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Phil Bainbridge"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994", "response": ["Durham won the toss and on an easy paced pitch chose to bat first. After both openers were dismissed inside the first 75 minutes, number three John Morris shared century partnerships with Stewart Hutton (61) and Phil Bainbridge (67). Morris was dismissed early on the second day but his innings of 204 was the highest by a Durham player at the time, it was also his first century for Durham since moving from Derbyshire. An eighth wicket stand of 134 between Anderson Cummins  (62) and David Graveney (65*) boosted the total before a mid-afternoon declaration. The early wicket of Dominic Ostler brought Brian Lara to the crease, dropped on 18 by wicket-keeper Chris Scott at the close Lara was 111 not out and had become the first player to score seven centuries in eight innings. The third day of the match was rained off and with the captains unable to agree on a target, Lara had free rein to bat on. He took the opportunity by scoring 174 runs in the pre-lunch session, in the afternoon he added a further 133 and in the process beat the previous best by a Warwickshire player (305* by Frank Foster) and passed 1,000 runs for the season in only his seventh innings. After tea he passed Archie MacLaren's 424, the highest score in England, and progressed to 497 by the time of the final over. Still two runs short of the first-class record, Lara was made aware it was the last over of the match by batting partner Keith Piper after the fourth ball, the next delivery was driven for four to break the record. Lara's innings took 427 balls and lasted less than eight hours. He broke the records for most boundaries in an innings (72) and most runs in a single day (390). Trevor Penney contributed just 44 to a third wicket partnership of 314 with Lara while the unbeaten fifth wicket partnership between Lara and Piper was worth 322. The team total of 810/4 bettered the county record by over 150 runs."]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Phil Bainbridge (born 1958), played for Gloucestershire and Durham."]}, {"page": "List of Durham County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Phil Bainbridge (1991\u20131996) : P.
