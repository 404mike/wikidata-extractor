His best year was 1922 when he took 169 wickets, then a Nottinghamshire record, later overtaken by Bruce Dooland. His career then faded rather fast, and he dropped out of the county side after 1928. \nRichmond's one Test match was on his home ground of Trent Bridge against the all-conquering Australian cricket team of 1921 led by Warwick Armstrong. He scored six runs in two innings and took two wickets for 86 runs, but was never chosen again. \nRichmond's batting was rarely of any account, and, like his fielding, suffered as he got older and stouter. But in 1922, against Derbyshire at Worksop, he scored 70 in 65 minutes, putting on 140 for the tenth wicket with Sam Staples.", "link_mentions": {}}}
