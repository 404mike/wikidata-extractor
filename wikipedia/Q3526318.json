His best year was 1922 when he took 169 wickets, then a Nottinghamshire record, later overtaken by Bruce Dooland. His career then faded rather fast, and he dropped out of the county side after 1928. \nRichmond's one Test match was on his home ground of Trent Bridge against the all-conquering Australian cricket team of 1921 led by Warwick Armstrong. He scored six runs in two innings and took two wickets for 86 runs, but was never chosen again. \nRichmond's batting was rarely of any account, and, like his fielding, suffered as he got older and stouter. But in 1922, against Derbyshire at Worksop, he scored 70 in 65 minutes, putting on 140 for the tenth wicket with Sam Staples.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Tom Richmond \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Tom Richmond", "response": ["Tom Richmond may refer to:", "*Tom Richmond (cricketer) (1890\u20131957), England Test cricketer", "*Tom Richmond (illustrator) (born 1966), American humorous illustrator and cartoonist", "*Tom Richmond (cinematographer) (born 1950), American cinematographer", "*Tom Richmond (Montana politician), member of the Montana Senate"]}, {"page": "Tich Richmond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Richmond (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Len Richmond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Richmond (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "T.L.

Until they fell away somewhat in the late thirties, Notts were one of the most competitive teams and usually in contention. They won the title in 1929 and were runners-up in three other seasons. Noted batsmen were George Gunn, \"Dodge\" Whysall, Arthur Carr, Joe Hardstaff Jr, Charles Harris, Walter Keeton, Wilfred Payton and Willis Walker. Besides Larwood and Voce, Notts had good bowlers in Fred Barratt, Tom Richmond and Sam Staples. Ben Lilley succeeded Thomas Oates as wicket-keeper in 1924 and held the post until he retired in 1937 and was succeeded by Arthur Wheat."]}]}}
