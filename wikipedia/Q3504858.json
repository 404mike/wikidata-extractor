Hemimetabolan species, whose larvae look like the adult, have an embryo that completes all developmental stages (namely: \"protopod\", \"polipod\", and \"oligopod\" stages) inside the eggshell. Holometabolan species instead have vermiform larvae and a pupal stage after incomplete development and hatching. The debate continued through the twentieth century, with some authors (like Charles P\u00e9rez in 1902) claiming the precocious eclosion theory outlandish, Antonio Berlese reestablishing it as the leading theory in 1913, and Augustus Daniel Imms disseminating it widely among Anglo-Saxon readers from 1925 (see Wigglesworth 1954 for review). One of the most contentious aspects of the precocious eclosion theory that fueled further debate in the field of evolution and development was the proposal that the hemimetabolan nymphal stages are equivalent to the holometabolan pupal stage. Critics of this theory (most notably H. E. Hinton) argue that post-embryonic development in hemimetabolans and holometabolans are equivalent, and rather the last nymphal instar stage of hemimetabolans would be homologous to the holometabolan pupae. More modern opinions still oscillate between these two conceptions of the hemi- to holometabolan evolutionary trend."]}, {"page": "H.E. Hinton", "response": ["#REDIRECT H. E.

Wiltshire Gazette and Herald, 14 December 1978 Educated at Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School, where thirty years earlier the author William Golding had also been educated, he gained his Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from the University of Bristol in 1965, followed by a PhD in 1969 supervised by H. E. Hinton. His thesis investigated the evolution of the migratory habit in butterflies and applied principles of behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology to the insect migration.The Times Newspaper, Science Report, 9 April 1968 This work was subsequently published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society."]}]}}
