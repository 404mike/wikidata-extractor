Harrington was first\u2013choice goalkeeper at Chester by the end of 1982\u201383, but an injury in the penultimate game of the season at Torquay United prematurely ended his campaign and led to defender Noel Bradley having to deputise for him. But Harrington recovered in time for one of his most memorable games for Chester in a League Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers in September 1983, when he saved the first three Bolton penalties in the penalty shoot-out to give Chester victory. This season saw him miss just five games for Chester, but unfortunately the campaign ended with the club finishing bottom of The Football League."]}, {"page": "John Butcher", "response": ["John Butcher may refer to:", "*John Butcher (musician) (born 1954), British saxophonist", "*John Butcher (Australian footballer) (born 1991), Australian rules footballer with the Port Adelaide Football Club", "*John Butcher, 1st Baron Danesfort (1853\u20131935), British lawyer", "*John Butcher (British politician) (1946\u20132006), Conservative MP for Coventry South-West 1979\u20131997", "*John Butcher (baseball) (born 1957), former Major League Baseball player", "*John Butcher (English footballer) (born 1956), English association football goalkeeper who played for Blackburn"]}, {"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["He became manager of Chester City in January 1984, who were struggling at the foot of the Fourth Division, but some improved results (including a derby win over Wrexham) gave cause for optimism for the following season.

He lost his job in December 1984, after a 5\u20131 loss to Stockport County. Although results were not always impressive, McGrath began to mould the side that would to go on to win promotion in 1985\u201386 after further strengthening by Mick Speight and Harry McNally.

He was unable to make the first team at Anfield and joined Wigan Athletic in July 1984. Stewart made 14 league appearances in two years at Springfield Park before former Latics manager Harry McNally signed him for Chester City in August 1986. After initially sharing goalkeeping duties with John Butcher, Mike Stowell and Mike Astbury, Stewart established himself as a starting goalkeeper. Between January 1988 and October 1990 he did not miss a match; his run of 124 games only ended after a sending-off at Bradford City. In 1992\u201393 Stewart was named as the club's player of the season (despite conceding more than 100 goals), but a pre-match injury at Scarborough in September 1993 sidelined him for the remainder of the following season. Stewart was allowed to join Northampton Town in July 1994, but ended the season playing at Wembley Stadium for Chesterfield in the Football League Division Three playoff final against Bury (while on loan with the Saltergate club). He helped Chesterfield to a 2\u20130 victory and promotion, and returned to Chester in the summer of 1995. Stewart missed only one game in 1995\u201396, but at the end of the season he dropped into gon-league football with Southport. Stewart played for the Sandgrounders for three and a half years, making another trip to Wembley in the final of the 1997\u201398 FA Trophy (which ended in a 1\u20130 defeat to Cheltenham Town). Stewart moved to fellow Conference side Hednesford Town in December 1999 and later played for such clubs as Bamber Bridge, Rhyl, Marine and Colwyn Bay."]}, {"page": "David Kaye (footballer)", "response": ["Kaye began his career as an apprentice with Rotherham United, where he turned professional in November 1977. However, he failed to make a league appearance for the Millers and played non-league football for Mexborough Town before returning to The Football League when he joined Chester City in March 1985. He played in Chester's final seven games of the 1984\u20131985 season and then played three league games and a League Cup tie early the following season. Kaye lost his place to John Butcher and Chester then signed another goalkeeper in Ray Cashley."]}, {"page": "Jim Arnold (footballer)", "response": ["After leaving Rising Brook, Arnold played for non-league Stafford Rangers, and also appeared on loan for the Sandbach Ramblers. During his time at Stafford Rangers he appeared in two separate FA Trophy finals at Wembley. In 1976 Stafford lost to Scarborough 3\u20132 after extra-time; Arnold saved a John Woodhall penalty in this match. In the 1979 final Arnold played as Stafford beat Kettering Town 2\u20130. He was signed by Blackburn Rovers manager Howard Kendall in 1979 to provide competition for John Butcher and went on to make his Football League debut at the age of 29. Arnold kept a club record nineteen clean sheets in 1979\u201380, as Rovers won promotion out of the Third Division as runners-up, with only the top two clubs in the English Football League, Liverpool and Manchester United, conceding fewer than 36 league goals. Despite Arnold missing three months with a groin injury, just 29 league goals were conceded in 1980\u201381, a record only beaten by Lincoln City, as Rovers missed out on promotion from the Second Division by just three points."]}, {"page": "John Butcher (footballer born 1956)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Butcher (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | John Butcher"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | John Butcher"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | John Butcher"]}]}}
