The car was not competitive during the 2010 season, with many mechanical failures preventing Baggsy from qualifying. In 2011, the Subaru had a 1JZ engine transplant which helped the car become more competitive, with a second-place finish at the final round of the season. \nSteve's 1JZ-GTE powered Subaru made headlines in 2011 for all the wrong reasons when it was stolen while on display at Santa Pod Raceway. The drifting and general car community pitched in to find the car and within hours of the theft, videos were uploaded showing the car driving on the M1, the M25 and the M4 motorways. The car was recovered and the thieves were convicted with combined sentences of 15 years in prison. During 2012, Baggsy was a regular podium finisher and ended up 5th in the final championship standings. In 2013, Baggsy left Team Japspeed and joined Acorn Motorsport Division, now back in a Nissan 200sx S13. His season got off to a bad start, with a major crash at Lydden Hill, causing extensive damage to the car.\nBaggsy took first place, and was crowned 'King of Kings' in the 2014 European Super Final in Malta.\nBaggsy is a Monster Energy athlete and features at Monster demonstrations across Europe.
