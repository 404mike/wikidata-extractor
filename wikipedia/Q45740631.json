Performed from May 18 to June 24, 2012, this comedy-drama follows the intimate life of a Palestinian family in Israeli-occupied Bethlehem. The protagonist Fadwa (played by Lameece Issaq herself) is living at home to care for her increasingly demented father Baba (Laith Nakli). Fadwa's sister Dalal (Maha Chehlaoui) is set to marry her betrothed Amir (Arian Moayed) so family members begin to arrive for the wedding. An American-assimilated cousin Hayat (Heather Raffo) arrives, sparking envy in Fadwa. Specifically, this is the catalyst for the return of Emir's older brother Youssif (Haaz Sleiman) who Fadwa had a childhood romance with. Amidst the realities of mandated curfews and Israeli checkpoints, interpersonal relationships continue. Fadwa spends her time imagining she is hosting a cooking show for a live audience while preparing food for Dalal's wedding. She makes traditional Arab recipes such as Baba ghanoush and Hummus while talking to her imagined studio audience and making comments on the unfolding events. While some critics were unimpressed by the melodramatic plot because it did not center on the violence of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, others found richness in character details and comedy.", "What is different about this forum is that the creative process is opened to guest playwrights, actors, and directors from all backgrounds.
