Conn could also claim membership of Nelson's \"Band of Brothers\", a clique of dashing naval officers who participated in Nelson's campaigns during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, as well as a close friendship with the admiral himself, who once said: \"A better or more zealous officer than Captain Conn is not in His Majesty's service.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
