Conn could also claim membership of Nelson's \"Band of Brothers\", a clique of dashing naval officers who participated in Nelson's campaigns during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, as well as a close friendship with the admiral himself, who once said: \"A better or more zealous officer than Captain Conn is not in His Majesty's service.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Copenhagen (1801)", "response": ["* Discovery (bomb, Cmdr.

Parker, supported by howitzer boats commanded by Captain John Conn. The darkness of the night and a powerful tide meant that the boats arrived separately rather than together, and Jones' division missed the action completely. The French were well-prepared, and the attackers were met by heavy fire from the ships and from shore. Medusas boats attempted to board a large brig, but they were frustrated by nets stretched around the bulwarks.  Medusa suffered 55 casualties, the most of any ship. Midshipmen William Gore and William Bristow, 14 seamen and 4 marines were killed, and Captain Parker, Lieutenants Charles Pelley and Frederick Langford, the Master William Kirby, Midshipman the Hon.
