Though the 1905 Ashes series was his most successful with two centuries, from the following year Tyldesley gradually dropped out of the representative scene, playing his last Test in 1909. However, in 1906 against that year County Champions, Kent, Tyldesley made his highest score of 295 not out and would certainly have made a triple hundred had he not ran out of partners. With Reggie Spooner rarely available owing to business calls between 1907 and 1910, and Archie MacLaren declining, Lancashire were much too dependent upon Tyldesley to make a respectable score and he played superbly especially when one considers the fire in Old Trafford pitches in fine weather at that time."]}, {"page": "1912 Triangular Tournament", "response": ["* On a sunny second day, Reggie Spooner scored 119, and Frank Woolley 73, with Pegler taking 7 for 65.

Thornton had selected a strong team captained by Reggie Spooner and including George Hirst, Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs, Johnny Douglas, Arthur Dolphin, Greville Stevens and Bill Hitch. It was a good toss to win and Spooner put the Australians in to face the pace of Hitch who bowled them out for 81 in just 31 overs. Hitch took five of the first six wickets, four of them bowled, and finished with six for 24. The early fire had gone out of the pitch by afternoon although Gregory still caused real problems for the English batsmen. At the close, Thornton's XI were 146 for eight and they extended this to 187, Gregory taking seven for 83. Needing a substantial recovery, the AIF started badly with Trenerry out for a duck but Collins and Willis took the score on to 93 before Collins was out. Willis, the highest runscorer for the AIF in England, made 96 before he was caught behind off Hirst. Taylor (71) and Lampard (36) combined well for the seventh wicket and the Australians were 264 for six at close of play on day two. On the final morning, Hitch again cut loose and the last four wickets went down with only 32 more runs added. AIF 296, Hitch five for 102 and eleven wickets in the match. Thornton's XI needed 191 to win with most of the final day remaining and got them with two wickets to spare but they owed it to Hobbs who held the innings together with 93. This was only the fourth defeat the AIF conceded in England, having won and drawn twelve each of the other 24 matches."]}, {"page": "R.

His unselfishness and finesse no doubt gave him the wonderful knack of knowing how to keep his line together, a quality which England's selectors have unhappily found wanting in nearly all the inside-forwards with whom they have experimented since the Second World War. Gosling's play... was the very refinement of football, and effective football, too.

His highest batting average came in 2000, when he scored 775 runs at 40.78. He was boosted that season by an early-season tally of 160 against Oxford Universities, as part of a 305-run partnership with Peter Bowler for the fourth wicket. The partnership was only five runs less than Somerset's record for the fourth wicket, made in 1980 by Peter Denning and Ian Botham. His performances in the County Championship were less impressive than his overall first-class record in 2000; he averaged below thirty in the competition, and only reached a century once, against Lancashire. In 2001, Burns reached his highest first-class score, and only double-century, scoring 221 against Yorkshire at the Recreation Ground in Bath. The total, made on what Wisden described as the \"benignest of pitches\", included 28 fours and 1 six, and took seven and three-quarter hours. The match finished as a high-scoring draw, with over 1,000 runs being scored. Burns' score is the highest by a Somerset batsman at the Recreation Ground during a first-class match, although three players have scored more playing against Somerset at the ground; Reggie Spooner scored 240 runs in 1906, Mike Gatting got 258 in 1984 and Warwick Armstrong scored an unbeaten 303 for Australia in 1905. Burns also scored his second century in List A cricket during 2001, striking 101 not out against Northamptonshire from 112 balls. When Somerset captain Jamie Cox broke his thumb, Burns took charge of the team for six matches in June and July 2001, a role he reprised for eight matches the following season. In 2001, Somerset recorded one of the best seasons in their history: they finished second in the County Championship, their highest ever position, and won the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy."]}, {"page": "Roses Match", "response": ["Lancashire finally surpassed their 1926 record total of 509 for 9 declared in 2005 in another high scoring draw when they posted 537 thanks to skipper Mark Chilton and Iain Sutcliffe's opening partnership of 223.
