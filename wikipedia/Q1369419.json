He began his career in the Scottish Football League with spells at Stenhousemuir and Livingston, before joining Cardiff City in May 2001 for a fee of \u00a3130,000. At Ninian Park, he went on to make over 200 appearances in all competitions during a six-year spell at the club, helping them achieve promotion to the Football League First Division via the 2003 Football League Second Division play-off Final. A contract dispute with the club led to a free transfer to fellow Football League Championship side Ipswich Town in 2007.\nAfter six months at Portman Road, he returned to Scotland with Rangers. Alexander was primarily understudy to Allan McGregor, but won the Scottish Cup twice, the Scottish League Cup three times and played in the 2008 UEFA Cup Final. He became the first choice goalkeeper for Rangers after McGregor left the club following Rangers entering administration and subsequent liquidation in 2012. Alexander left Rangers in 2013 after a dispute over wages, having won the Scottish Third Division title at the first attempt, to join Premier League side Crystal Palace. He made one appearance for Palace during the 2013\u201314 season, in the Football League Cup, before being released.\nHe returned to Scotland for a third time following the expiration of his contract at Palace with Heart of Midlothian. In his first season with the club, he helped them win the Scottish Championship title, returning to the Scottish Premiership after one season and remained first choice the following season, as they achieved a third-place finish in the top division. Alexander was released by Hearts in 2016 and then spent a year as a backup at Aberdeen. He then returned to Livingston in 2017, and helped them win promotion in his final season as a player.\nAlexander represented Scotland at under-21 and B levels and gained three caps at full international level in 2006, winning the Kirin Cup.\nAfter retiring as a player, Alexander was goalkeeping coach of Dundee United from 2018 to 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Lawson (musician)", "response": ["* Hidden Windows (2012) with Neil Alexander"]}, {"page": "Livingston F.C.", "response": ["*   Neil Alexander"]}, {"page": "Roy Carroll", "response": ["On 9 January 2008, it was revealed that Carroll was in line for a move to Premier League side Derby County.

This was a highly charged affair from the kick-off, with a re-invigorated Celtic dominating the opening proceedings and making their dominance count when Shunsuke Nakamura scored a spectacular goal from around 35 yards, which later ended up as Celtic's 'Goal of the Season', on the 20-minute mark. Rangers hit back in the second half when Nacho Novo equalised but Celtic got a chance to retake the lead when Nakamura's curling shot was illegally handled off the line by Carlos Cu\u00e9llar, who was sent off. However, McDonald's penalty was struck poorly and Allan McGregor, despite having an injured ankle, was able to save it. Celtic pushed in vain for a winner against 10 men but it seemed like Rangers would get the draw they played for, and which would all but seem to secure them the title. However, in the third minute of injury time, a quick throw in led to ball being played outside the box to Samaras who knocked it down to Gary Caldwell. Caldwell hit a diagonal ball into the box where McDonald squared the ball for Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink to nod the ball home inside the six-yard box past Neil Alexander, who replaced the injured McGregor. However spectacular Nakamura's first half goal was, Vennegoor of Hesselink's proved to be a hugely pivotal moment in the title race. There were jubilant scenes around all the Celtic fans.

The goal was later shown by TV replays to have been offside, however Celtic were not going to let this good fortune pass them by. Rangers equalised in the 17th minute with a David Weir header from a corner kick and Celtic's set-piece weakness was exploited again less than 15 minutes later when Daniel Cousin scored from another corner kick. Shortly before half time though, Aiden McGeady found Scott McDonald just inside the Rangers box. He turned Christian Dailly and struck a looping shot past Neil Alexander to make it 2\u20132. The second half saw both teams have plenty of chances and Celtic were given a penalty after Kirk Broadfoot brought down McDonald. Barry Robson took the responsibility and duly delivered by driving the ball past Alexander.
