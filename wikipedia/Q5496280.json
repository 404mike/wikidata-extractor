On one sortie the pilot was killed. Slingsby climbed out of his gun position and into the pilot's cockpit and regained control of the aircraft. He flew the aircraft back to the British lines. For this, he was awarded the Military Medal.  After he left the service, now the RAF, in 1920, he bought a partnership in a wood-working and furniture factory in Queen Street, Scarborough.\nSlingsby was a founder member of Scarborough Gliding Club, one of the first British gliding clubs in February 1930. By the end of that year, it had 40 active flying members.  The first gliders were built in his factory in Queen Street, Scarborough. This was transferred to the town's abandoned tram sheds, before a completely new factory was built in Kirbymoorside in 1934 and he abandoned furniture-making.\nHis first glider, in 1931, was a Falcon, which was a British version of the RRG Falke, built by Rh\u00f6n-Rossitten Gesellschaft and designed by Alexander Lippisch.  In 1933, Slingsby started producing RFD Daglings, as the Type 3. The initial wave of interest in gliding in Britain tailed off  and by 1932 Scarborough Gliding Club was in financial trouble. It merged with another club, and further mergers produced the Yorkshire Gliding Club, based at Sutton Bank, near Thirsk. Philip Wills and Fred Slingsby negotiated the lease of the land at Sutton Bank.\nWith the outbreak of World War II in 1939 Slingsby changed production, initially building rudders for the Avro Anson although they sold a few gliders for radar experiments. Eventually an order was received for the design and production of the Hengist troop carrying glider. In addition, Slingsby received orders for primary training gliders for the Royal Air Force's Air Training Corps (ATC). With the Hengist and training glider orders along with the repairs and manufacturing of spare parts, the Slingsby company was kept busy throughout the war. Anticipating the end of the war and the need for better training gliders for both the ATC and private clubs, Slingsby designed and built both a tandem and a side-by- side prototype glider to meet this need. This later design became the Slingsby T.21B Sedbergh. Other gliders followed (see Slingsby Aviation) until the company was merged into the Vickers Group during late 1969.\nFred Slingsby was awarded the Paul Tissander Diploma by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale in 1957.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amy Johnson", "response": ["Johnson was a friend and collaborator of Fred Slingsby whose Yorkshire based company, Slingsby Aviation of Kirbymoorside, North Yorkshire became the UK's most famous glider manufacturer.

They built 27 in 1930-31.  The type became known as the Dagling, a name formed by combining Dagnall and Z\u00f6gling, which later became used informally to cover all types of primary gliders in the UK.  Fred Slingsby took over construction in 1934 and production continued up to the outbreak of World War II. The Primary should not be confused with the similar T.38 Grasshopper which was produced for the Air Training Corps in the 1950s."]}, {"page": "Slingsby Falcon III", "response": ["The Slingsby T.4 Falcon 3 was a two-seat training glider produced from 1935, by Fred Slingsby in Kirbymoorside, Yorkshire.", "Espin Hardwick persuaded Fred Slingsby to build a two-seat version of the Falcon. Slingsby enlarged the fuselage to accept side by side seating for pupil and instructor, and enlarged the aircraft to cope with the increased weight. The increased span wings were attached to a rectangular centre-section which was supported by six struts. To increase the field of vision the centre section had celluloid panels and the wing root fairing strips were made from a clear plastic, both of these vision aids tended to have short lives, and were usually replaced with doped fabric or plywood as appropriate."]}, {"page": "Slingsby Kite", "response": ["The Slingsby T.6/T.23 Kirby Kite was a single-seat sport glider produced from 1935, by Fred Slingsby in Kirbymoorside, Yorkshire.", "During the early 1930s there was a dearth of high-performance gliders that could be flown by relatively inexperienced pilots. To remedy this shortcoming Fred Slingsby modified the Grunau Baby design with longer gulled wings and rounded fuselage formers skinned with plywood, resulting in the T.6 Kirby Kite. Later developments included spoilers to improve landing performance and an enlarged rudder which improved the harmony of the controls. Further re-design was carried out at the end of World War II, with a raised wing pylon, landing wheel and spoilers fitted as standard. The T.23 Kite 1A flew in December 1945 but did not enter production due to the limited improvement in performance, but further development was planned, as the Type 23A, with a new 1\u00b0 dihedral straight wings, the production of which is uncertain. The final iteration of the Slingsby Grunau Baby derivatives was the T.26 Kite 2, which introduced an entirely new wing, an enclosed cockpit, straight tapered wings and other detailed improvements."]}, {"page": "Slingsby Kirby Tutor", "response": ["The Slingsby T.8 Kirby Tutor was a single-seat sport glider produced from 1937, by Fred Slingsby in Kirbymoorside, Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "Slingsby Kirby Gull", "response": ["In the late 1930s the gliding movement in the UK did not receive the support from the government that was forthcoming in other European states. Fred Slingsby designed the Type 12 Gull to be relatively inexpensive and easy to fly in the hands of the inexperienced pilots in the UK. Slingsby had had a bad experience with the Type 9 King Kite entering incipient spins at low airspeed which was ascribed to the use of a NACA 4312 aerofoil section at the wing-tips, so he designed the Gull with a modified RAF 34 profile at the tips. The cause of the wing drop problem on the King Kite was later found to be inaccurate manufacture, but the Gull retained the modified RAF 34 section."]}, {"page": "Slingsby Falcon", "response": ["The Slingsby T.1/T.2 Falcon or British Falcon) was a single-seat sport glider produced, in 1931-37, by Fred Slingsby in Scarborough, Yorkshire.", "Fred Slingsby had noticed the lack of 'Intermediate' gliders available in England. At the recommendation of Guenther Groenhoff he acquired the plans for Lippisch's Falke and built ten aircraft: the Falcon, Falcon 2 and eight further Falcons (a.k.a. British Falcon). These aircraft were flown successfully for many years, but gradually succumbed till none were left airworthy. One was exported to Canada, and one was converted to a flying-boat glider for use by the Air Training Corps on Windermere, surviving to this day in the Windermere Steamboat Museum. During 1984-5 Ken Fripp of Southdown Aero Services at Lasham built a reproduction Falcon from original plans for Mike Russell, bringing the total built to eleven."]}, {"page": "Cadet UT-1", "response": ["In 1942 Dawydoff obtained the plans and the rights to produce the Slingsby Cadet under licence from Fred Slingsby.

The Yorkshire Gliding Club was formed in April 1934 as an amalgamation of the Bradford Gliding Club with the Ilkley and District Gliding Club by Phil Wills, Fred Slingsby and Norman Sharpe.The Bradford club had absorbed the Leeds Gliding Club and had its premises at Apperley Bridge. They often trialled their gliders on Baildon Moor, but this proved to be too small for them when they amalgamated with the Ilkley Club, and so a new site was needed. The club moved to Sutton Bank in the second half of 1934 when they negotiated a lease on the site from the land owners (it was owned by the Church of England) with the site being perceived as second only to one at Dunstable in the development of British gliding. However, in the early days of gliding the airspace at Sutton Bank was deemed of far greater value as its launch site was  above the ground level at the bottom of the cliff compared to Dunstable's  clearance.", "*Fred Slingsby - founder of Slingsby Aviation"]}]}}
