American rapper Snoop Dogg has worked with different artists such as rapper Dr Zeus Bohemia (rapper), and the band RDB. Bohemia also collaborated with hip-hop artists such as Kurupt, Sean Kingston, Iraj Weeraratne and Baby Bash & The Game (rapper). The group RDB also worked with different hip hop artists such as T-Pain and Ludacris. In 2016, famous Indian rapper Badshah worked with dancehall musician Sean Paul in a song called \"Move Your Body\" with DJ Shadow Dubai. Desi rappers born and/or raised in the West have also bridged the cultures within their music, incorporating desi influences into their music. Anik Khan has blended Queens culture with Bengali influences into his music, and similarly, rappers Riz MC and Heems of the group Swet Shop Boys incorporate many South Asian influences in their music. In 2017, Pakistani rapper Ali Kaz collaborated with WWE music producer Jim Johnston for the theme song of WWE wrestler Jinder Mahal. In 2017, Badshah also did international collaboration with Major Lazer as a commercial promotion of Tuborg Brewery."]}, {"page": "Mister You", "response": ["|\"Jugni ji\" (DJ Kayz feat.
