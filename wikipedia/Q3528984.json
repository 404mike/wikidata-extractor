He was given seven matches, most of them in the early part of the season, but took only two wickets in them. He was perhaps unlucky with weather, in that his first two matches were rained off before he was brought on to bowl, but later on there seemed a marked reluctance to bowl him: in his final game, against the weak Worcestershire side, he did not bowl at all in the first innings and was the sixth bowler used in the second innings. Peare's bowling action at this time is described in a report of the Yorkshire match at Edgbaston in late May 1926: \"[Peare] has a short corkscrew kind of run, and a quick action, but his pace is only medium.\" The same newspaper reported that, in the same innings, Peare, fielding at mid-off, had let two successive shots from Herbert Sutcliffe off the bowling of Bob Wyatt pass through his hands to the boundary."]}, {"page": "Albert Wassell", "response": ["Warwickshire's bowling in 1923 was heavily dependent on the fast bowler, Harry Howell, who took nearly three times the number of wickets of any other player, and whose main support came from the amateur players Freddie Calthorpe and Norman Partridge.
