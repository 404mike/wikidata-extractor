Much research has been done during the past decades. The results, however, are scattered and often inaccessible. As Heather J. Sharkey points out, Richard Leslie Hill felt this problem a long time ago, when he said in the preface to the second edition of his Biographical dictionary of the Sudan, \"Little books are born in the Sudan by the dozen, without imprints without date, even without title page. They circulate for a brief season and die without trace.\""]}, {"page": "Deim Zubeir", "response": ["Little is known about historical developments at the location before the second half of the 19th century.

In his history of Turco-Egyptian rule in the Sudan (1820-1881), the historian Richard Leslie Hill described Mahu Bey as a level-headed administrator and a \"tower of strength\" in the province, who balanced Isma'il Pasha's demands for carrying out reprisals against local Sudanese Arab peoples (the Kababish, Hasaniyya, Shukriyya, and Ja'aliyyin) with the need for political and economic stability. Hill wrote that Mahu Bey suppressed a revolt of the Ja'aliyyin and demanded 50,000 dollars (Maria Theresa thalers), but declined to extract the full sum so that the people would not abandon the region and their waterwheels, or saqiyas, meaning their Nile-irrigation-based farms.  Mahu Bey resisted demands from Mehmet Pasha Ali himself, writing from Cairo, to crush the local Arab tribes completely, especially after locals killed Mehmet Ali's son Isma'il (leader of the conquest) by burning his hut, with him in it, during the night.  During the four decades that followed, other regional governors, who were less stability-minded than Mahu Bey, made heavy demands for taxes and indemnities; these demands led to mounting popular discontentment and contributed eventually to the Mahdist Revolution."]}]}}
