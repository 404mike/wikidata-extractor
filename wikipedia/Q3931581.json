She said that around 1834-5 she encountered the words in collection of the Songs of Scotland (1825) by Allan Cunningham in a library.  She adapted the music she had composed for another old Scottish poem, Kempye Kaye. She also amended the first verse slightly, the second verse greatly, which she thought was unsuitable, and wrote a new third verse.  In the 1850s Lady John published the song with some other songs of hers for the benefit of the widows and orphans of the soldiers killed in the Crimean War. The song became popular and was closely associated with Jenny Lind."]}, {"page": "Lady John Scott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alicia Ann Spottiswoode"]}, {"page": "Lady John (Alicia Ann Spottiswoode) Scott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alicia Ann Spottiswoode"]}]}}
