Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming\", according to historian Ben Macintyre. It was called the Trout Memo and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The memo contained several schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to Operation Mincemeat, the 1943 plan to conceal the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa, which was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: \"A Suggestion (not a very nice one)\", and continued: \"The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it would have to be a fresh one.\"", "Fleming based his creation on individuals he met during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division, and admitted that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother Peter, whom he worshipped, and who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war. Fleming envisaged that Bond would resemble the composer, singer and actor Hoagy Carmichael; others, such as author and historian Ben Macintyre, identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond. General references in the novels describe Bond as having \"dark, rather cruel good looks\".", "For the first five books (Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love) Fleming received broadly positive reviews. That began to change in March 1958 when Bernard Bergonzi, in the journal Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work as containing \"a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism\" and wrote that the books showed \"the total lack of any ethical frame of reference\". The article compared Fleming unfavourably with John Buchan and Raymond Chandler on both moral and literary criteria. A month later, Dr. No was published, and Fleming received harsh criticism from reviewers who, in the words of Ben Macintyre, \"rounded on Fleming, almost as a pack\". The most strongly worded of the critiques came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman, who, in his review \"Sex, Snobbery and Sadism\", called the novel \"without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read\". Johnson went on to say that \"by the time I was a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away\". Johnson recognised that in Bond there \"was a social phenomenon of some importance\", but this was seen as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned \"three basic ingredients in Dr No, all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult.\" Johnson saw no positives in Dr. No, and said, \"Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner.\"", "A theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War. The Times journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was \"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\", at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed. Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters: in For Your Eyes Only, the villain, Hammerstein, is a former Gestapo officer, while the sympathetic Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under Montgomery in the Eighth Army. Similarly, in Moonraker, Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a \"megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman\", and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff. In this, Fleming \"exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.\" As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly."]}, {"page": "Semicolon", "response": ["In response to Truss, Ben Macintyre, a columnist in The Times,  wrote:"]}, {"page": "Mitford family", "response": ["The family became particularly known in the 1930s and later for the six Mitford sisters, great-great-great-granddaughters of William Mitford, and the daughters of David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, and his wife Sydney Bowles.

As such, Bond \"becomes something more than\u00a0... [the] cardboard figure\" that he had been in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as \"Elastic office hours from around ten until six,\u00a0... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends,\u00a0... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women.\" This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming's own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing \"a sourness\" in the author's character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond's other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gambling\u2014illegal except in private members clubs in 1955\u2014and excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka shared with M, two bottles of champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the alcohol consumption \"meant relaxation, ritual and reliability\". Benzedrine was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer."]}, {"page": "Aldrich Ames", "response": ["* Ames is featured in Ben Macintyre's best selling book The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War.

After about a year, they realised that it must be Gordievsky.

Ames first met and sold classified information to a KGB agent on 15 May 1985, in Washington, DC; the following day Gordievsky received the telegram from KGB leadership recalling him to Moscow. A 1994 report by the Washington Post, however, stated that \"After six weeks of questioning Ames ... the FBI and CIA remain baffled about whether Ames or someone else first warned the Soviets about Gordievsky\". An FBI report later stated that Ames had not advised the Soviets about Gordievsky until 13 June 1985; by that time, Gordievsky was under KGB surveillance but he had not yet been charged with treason as of 19 July 1985 when MI6 agents began the process of his escape. Nevertheless, biographer Ben Macintyre and most people involved in the Gordievsky case believe that during his first visit with the KGB in Washington in early May 1985, Ames provided sufficient information to prompt an investigation by Colonel Viktor Budanov, the KGB's top investigator, and trigger Gordievsky's recall.", "In 2018 Ben Macintyre published a biography of Gordievsky, The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War.
