While this version was included on the Japanese version of Atomic Kitten's debut album Right Now (2000), Innocent Records A&R manager Hugh Goldsmith felt that it was still a half\u2011finished song and asked songwriters and producers Jem Godfrey and Bill Padley to re-write it for the UK version of the album. With the chorus being already there, Godfrey and Padley decided on writing a melody for the verses and changed most of the chords in \"Whole Again,\" but were not able to change its key. Godfrey later described the process as \"quite difficult, because the chorus of the song was so hooky that the verse had to lead up to it but not overshadow it, which is why it ended up sounding as low as it does.
