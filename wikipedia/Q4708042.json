When he left school in 1967, he joined Birmingham City as an apprentice, and turned professional two years later. As a junior, he played on the wing, but became most comfortable in central defence. He made his first-team debut in the Anglo-Italian Tournament in 1971, and played his part in Birmingham's promotion to the First Division in the 1971\u201372 season. Having made his Football League debut on 22 April 1972 in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Middlesbrough, he stood in for the injured Stan Harland in the last two games of that season, both away from home, both of which Birmingham needed to \u2013 and did \u2013 win.
