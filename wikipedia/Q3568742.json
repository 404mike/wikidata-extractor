Lyell reconciled transmutation of species with natural theology by suggesting that it would be as much a \"remarkable manifestation of creative Power\" as creating each species separately. He countered Lamarck's views by rejecting continued cooling of the earth in favour of \"a fluctuating cycle\", a long-term steady-state geohistory as proposed by James Hutton. The fragmentary fossil record already showed \"a high class of fishes, close to reptiles\" in the Carboniferous period which he called \"the first Zoological era\", and quadrupeds could also have existed then. In November 1827, after William Broderip found a Middle Jurassic fossil of the early mammal Didelphis, Lyell told his father that \"There was everything but man even as far back as the Oolite.\" Lyell inaccurately portrayed Lamarckism as a response to the fossil record, and said it was falsified by a lack of progress. He said in the second volume of Principles that the occurrence of this one fossil of the higher mammalia \"in these ancient strata, is as fatal to the theory of successive development, as if several hundreds had been discovered.\""]}, {"page": "List of malacologists", "response": ["*William Broderip (1789\u20131859) England"]}, {"page": "Inception of Darwin's theory", "response": ["The geologist Charles Lyell invited Darwin to dinner on 29 October 1836. Over dinner Lyell listened eagerly to Darwin's stories (which supported Lyell's uniformitarianism) and introduced him to Richard Owen and William Broderip, Tories who had just been involved in voting Grant out of a position at the Zoological Society. Owen was rapidly ousting Grant as the country's leading anatomist. Darwin went to visit him at his Royal College of Surgeons, and Owen agreed to work on some animal specimens in spirits and the fossil bones. Owen shared Darwin's enthusiasm. He was a proponent of German ideas of \"organising energy\" and vehemently opposed to Grant's evolution. At around this time Grant was one of the few to volunteer his help with cataloguing the collection. Darwin turned down the offer, not wanting to be associated with a disreputable radical who denounced his Cambridge friends."]}, {"page": "William John Broderip", "response": ["#redirect William Broderip"]}, {"page": "Second voyage of HMS Beagle", "response": ["Darwin thought of having his diary published mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives, including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood, urged that it be published separately.

Darwin set to work reorganising his diary, trimming it, and incorporating scientific material from his notes.
