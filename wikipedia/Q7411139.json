He was a left-hand batsman and left-arm slow-medium bowler who played for Leicestershire.\nBorn in Earl Shilton, Leicestershire, Coe made a total of 448 appearances for his home county over a 27-year period. He also twice played for London County, once for the Players against Gentlemen in 1908 and once for an England XI against the touring Australians of 1909.\nCoe scored 17,438 first-class runs at an average of 24.69 and passed 1,000 for a season seven times. His best seasonal total was 1,258 in 1914 which included his best innings of 252 not out against Northamptonshire in four hours. This score was Coe's only double century and remained the county's highest score until beaten by Phil Simmons in 1994.Coe's bowling returned 335 wickets at 32.20, with a best of 6/38 against London County in 1903. He passed 50 wickets in a season once, when in 1905 he claimed 52 at 22.38.In July 1900, Coe became the first county victim of Bernard Bosanquet's innovation, the googly. The ball reportedly bounced four times before Coe was out stumped for 98.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Samuel Coe || 17,367"]}, {"page": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1906", "response": ["Learmond and Morrison replaced Cameron and Parker.

He also played first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club, Gentlemen of England, London County and an England XI amongst others. Four of Raphael's five centuries were scored for Oxford University, including his career best score of 201 which he made against Yorkshire, who had the bowling of Wilfred Rhodes at their disposal. It remains the only double hundred to be made by an Oxford cricketer against Yorkshire. His only century for Surrey came in the 1904 County Championship, which he captained his county for much of, scoring 111 against Worcestershire. A part-time bowler, his three first-class wickets were of Samuel Coe, Lord Dalmeny and Test cricketer John King."]}, {"page": "Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)", "response": ["Practising throughout 1899 and 1900, Bosanquet began to use the googly in minor matches before using it in important cricket. His first use of the new delivery in first-class cricket came in the match against Leicestershire in 1900 in which he scored two centuries. In the second innings, Samuel Coe had scored 98 when Bosanquet, still known as a fast-bowler, bowled his off break; the ball bounced four times and the batsman was stumped (although, writing in 1925, Bosanquet recalled Coe had been bowled).Green, p. 177. Bosanquet later wrote that the wicket \"was rightly treated as a joke, and was the subject of ribald comment\". Middlesex captains permitted him to try googlies if there was little pressure on, but he later wrote: \"Though I could claim some five or six wickets before the close of the season, my efforts produced far more laughter than dismay in the hearts of opposing batsmen\".Bosanquet, p. 365. But Bosanquet persisted with the delivery and soon began to be noticed by influential cricketers who recognised the potential of the googly. Previously, some bowlers occasionally bowled unintended googlies, but were unable to control them. Although batsmen were accustomed to off break or leg break bowlers, it was an unprecedented problem to face a bowler who could bowl both types of delivery at will, disguising which one he bowled. Bosanquet persuaded teammates to remain silent as he wished to maintain the impression that his off break was an accident so that batsmen were not expecting it. He further tried to play down his successes: he feigned surprise, acting as if they were similarly accidental.Green, p. 178."]}, {"page": "Sam Coe", "response": ["#REDIRECTSamuel Coe"]}, {"page": "Gustavus Fowke", "response": ["Fowke was one of those over-40s, but was in fact only at the start of his cricket career, and he remained as Leicestershire's captain for the next five seasons, overseeing a transition in the team that saw the retirement of older players such as John King, Samuel Coe and Arthur Mounteney and the introduction of the nucleus of the team of the 1930s with Les Berry, Norman Armstrong, Haydon Smith and Alan Shipman. His own performances did not equal those of 1922, but nor did they fall much short: he made at least 500 runs in each season and his season average only once dipped below 15 runs per innings. His only century for Leicestershire was an innings of 104 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1923. In that match and in others until the emergence of Eddie Dawson, Berry and Shipman as regular opening batsmen, Fowke opened the innings, but later he dropped down the batting order to No 6 or No 7, and sometimes even lower. He missed a few matches in 1926 through a leg strain, but otherwise maintained fitness through to the end of the 1927 season, when he played in 29 first-class matches, more than in any other season, and then retired."]}, {"page": "List of London County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Samuel Coe : S.
