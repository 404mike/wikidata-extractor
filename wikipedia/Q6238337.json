They had two children, Victoria (b. 1949) and Richard (b. 1953). Their marriage ended in divorce.\n\nHay worked as a solicitor practicing in Brighton and London. He served as Chairman of the Young Conservatives 1947\u201349 and was elected to Parliament in 1950 as Member for Henley, South Oxfordshire. He became Parliamentary Private Secretary to the President of the Board of Trade, 1951\u201355, and later served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport from 1959 to 1963 under Ernest Marples, where he introduced parking meters, and as the last Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1963 to 1964, whereupon the reorganisation of the Ministry of Defence, he became Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Army until the Labour Party won the October 1964 general election.\nHay retired from politics and Parliament in 1974 and married Janet Spruce in 1975.

He reached the final shortlist of three along with two other sitting MPs, William Shelton and Norman Fowler, and in September 1972 was selected as candidate with a clear majority at the first ballot. Part of the reason was that the Association wanted a wealthy MP who would not be distracted by the need to earn money in business as Hay had been. He maintained a constituency home in Crocker End, near Nettlebed, and still maintained a London home at Wilton Crescent."]}, {"page": "HMS Hermes (R12)", "response": ["Civil Lord of the Admiralty John Hay said in Parliament on 2 March 1964 that \"Phantoms will be operated from \"Hermes\", \"Eagle\" and the new carrier when it is built. ...

The  British RR Spey engines replacing the US General Electric J79 were a political necessity given the cancellation of the supersonic  British Hawker Siddeley P.1154 V/STOL aircraft project.  The projected superior fuel efficiency using the Spey engines was overshadowed by larger engine size and inflexibility.  From  the smaller Hermes takeoff would be at 25k rather than 28k from Eagle.N.

And an F-4 would have to be catapulted from Hermes at much lower take off weight -achieved by carrying less fuel  - than from Eagle and hence combat air patrols would be 25 to 50 percent less duration than from Eagle; from 2-2.5 hours to 1-1.5 hrs, N.

While the Phantoms built for the RN were modified in ways similar to F-8 Crusaders for the French Navy \u2013 improving deceleration on landing \u2013 the modifications were not entirely successful. Hermess flight deck was too short, her arresting gear as well as her catapults were not powerful enough to recover or launch the F-4Ks, even though they were slightly lighter, more economical and higher performing than their US Navy counterparts. The Phantom trials held on Hermes in 1969\u20131970 proved this, though in the views of Minister of Defence, Denis Healey, the carrier could operate the most modern aircraft, but in too small numbers to be effective. While it is clear that McNamara's claims that the F-4 was not safe for use on the USN , or 31,000-ton carriers, was rightly rejected by John Hay in 1964.HCDefence  Estimates debate, 64-5 It is clear that Hermes was not a viable substitute for CVA02, but the programme was politically and financially impossible."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Hay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Hay"]}, {"page": "Henley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Hay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Hay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Hay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Hay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Hay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John Hay"]}, {"page": "Conservative government, 1957\u20131964", "response": ["|John Hay||3 May 1963||\u00a0", "|Under-Secretary of State for Navy||John Hay||1 April 1964||\u00a0", "|John Hay||16 January 1959 \u2013 3 May 1963||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "John Hay (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Hay (1838\u20131905) was an American politician; Secretary of State 1898\u20131905.", "John Hay may also refer to:", "*John Hay, 1st Lord Hay of Yester (c. 1450\u2013c. 1508)", "*John Hay, 2nd Lord Hay of Yester (died 1513), Scottish nobleman", "*John Hay (Jesuit) (1546\u20131608), Jesuit scholar and educator", "*John Hay, 1st Marquess of Tweeddale (1625\u20131697), Lord Chancellor of Scotland", "*John Hay, 2nd Marquess of Tweeddale (1645\u20131713), Scottish nobleman", "*John Hay, 4th Marquess of Tweeddale (1695\u20131762), Scottish nobleman", "*John Hay, 12th Earl of Erroll (died 1704), Scottish nobleman", "*John Hay of Cromlix (1691\u20131740), Jacobite noble", "*John Hay (academic) (1942\u20132016), Australian academic", "*John Hay (Canadian politician) (1862\u20131925), Canadian politician", "*John Hay (cardiologist) (1873\u20131959), Liverpool physician", "*John Hay (director) (born 1964), English film director", "*John Hay (footballer) (fl. 1921\u20131922), Scottish footballer (Bradford City)", "*John Hay (Henley MP) (1919\u20131998), British Conservative Party politician, Member of Parliament", "*John Hay (nature writer) (1915\u20132011), American author", "*John Hay (New South Wales politician) (1816\u20131892), Australian politician from New South Wales", "*John Hay Drummond Hay (1816\u20131893), British diplomat", "*Sir John Hay, 6th Baronet (1788\u20131838), British baronet and Member of Parliament", "*Sir John Hay of Alderston, 1st Baronet (died 1706)", "*Sir John Hay of Lands and Barra, \"The Incendiary\" (1578-1654) Lord Provost of Edinburgh 1637\u201338", "*John Hay (priest) (born 1945), Dean of Raphoe from 2003 to 2013", "*Lord John Hay (disambiguation)", "*John Hays (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Hay (surname)", "response": ["* Ian Hay, pen name of John Hay Beith (1876\u20131952), British schoolmaster and soldier", "* John Hay (disambiguation), various including:", "** John Hay (1838\u20131905), American politician", "** John Hay (Henley MP) (1919\u20131998), British politician", "** Sir John Hay, 6th Baronet (1788\u20131838), British politician", "** Lord John Hay (disambiguation), several people", "* John Hay, 1st Lord Hay of Yester (c. 1450 \u2013 1508)", "* John Hay, 2nd Lord Hay of Yester (died 1513)", "* John Hay, 3rd Lord Hay of Yester (died 1543)", "* John Hay, 4th Lord Hay of Yester (died 1557)", "* John Hay, 8th Lord Hay of Yester (1593\u20131653) (became Earl of Tweeddale in 1646)", "* John Hay, 2nd Earl of Tweeddale (1626\u20131697) (became Marquess of Tweeddale in 1694)", "* John Hay, 2nd Marquess of Tweeddale (1645\u20131713)", "* John Hay, 4th Marquess of Tweeddale (1695\u20131762)", "* Edward Douglas John Hay, 13th Marquess of Tweeddale (1947\u20132005)", "* John Hay, 12th Earl of Erroll (died 1704)"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport", "response": ["*John Hay 16 January 1959 \u2013 3 May 1963"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*John Hay; MP for Henley (1950\u20131974)"]}, {"page": "Brighton Hove & Sussex Sixth Form College", "response": ["* John Hay, Conservative MP from 1950 to 1974 for Henley, and President from 1977 to 1981 of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions"]}, {"page": "John Hay (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hay (Henley MP)"]}, {"page": "John Albert Hay", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hay (Henley MP) "]}, {"page": "Little Baldon air crash", "response": ["Little Baldon is in the Henley parliamentary constituency.
