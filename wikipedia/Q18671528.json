Sir Thomas and his heirs also received grants of lands near \"Cronemoss\" (Cronymoor) in Hanmer, from which the family eventually took its name. He and his successors married Welsh heiresses through whom the family acquired more estates in Hanmer, Bettisfield, Halton, and Pentrepant in the parish of Sylatyn, near Oswestry. Sir Thomas's oldest son, Jordan, inherited family lands in Worthenbury, whilst his younger son, John of Upton (1277-1309), Constable of Caernarfon Castle, resided at and inherited Hanmer and was the first to use the family surname.Jacob Youde William Lloyd, History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog, vol. 2 (1882) pp 152, 374"]}, {"page": "Harlech", "response": ["As late as the 19th century some texts referred to \"Harddlech\" and \"Harddlech Castle\".The History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher, and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog, and the Ancient Lords of Arwystli, Cedewen, and Meirionydd :Volume 6, Jacob Youde William Lloyd, 1887.The Poetical Works of Lewis Glyn Cothi: A celebrated bard, p. 21, Lewis Glyn Cothi, 1837.

There are several types of cywydd, each with strictly defined rules that were well established by Ieuan's time. In the less rigid forms of poetry to which we are accustomed in English, strict rules might seem to result in a staid or dry poetry. But, as Glanmor Williams says, \u201cFar from being fetters which intolerably shackle the poet\u2019s ability to express himself freely, [the rules of cynghanedd and cywydd] become adornments which add to the power as well as the elegance of the verse\u201d.Glanmor Williams, Recovery, Reorientation and Reformation, Wales, c.1415-1642, University of Wales Press, 1987, p151 No wonder it took at least nine years to become a master poet! Of course these rules developed around the Welsh language, complicating  translation of the poetry into English. One poem that has been translated into English is an elegy for Dafydd Fychan ap Dafydd of Llyn-went, Llanbister, Radnorshire, and his friend Ieuan ap Gruffudd ap Hywel Llwyd of Cloch-faen, Llangurig, Montgomeryshire.Jacob Youde William Lloyd, The History of the Princes, the Lords Marcher and the Ancient Nobility of Powys Fadog, vol. 2, London, 1882, pp 274-6 The friends were slain in an ambush during the reign of Henry VI."]}, {"page": "Jacob Lloyd", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jacob Youde William Lloyd"]}]}}
