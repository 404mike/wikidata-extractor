Jenkins \u2013 active from the 1970s \u2013 is a British zoologist, specialising in mammals and employed as curator at the Natural History Museum, London. Jenkins has published research in a large number of papers, especially on smaller mammals such as shrews and bats. Her honours include the specific epithet derived from her first name for a species of rock rat found in Laos, Saxatilomys paulinae, prompting the invention of a common name \"Paulina's rock rat\". The mammalogists surname is also the eponym of other animal names, the shrew-tenrec Microgale jenkinsae, and derived in the masculine gender for the shrew Crocidura jenkinsi.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jenkins's shrew tenrec", "response": ["The specific epithet jenkinsae honours the British mammalogist Paulina D.
