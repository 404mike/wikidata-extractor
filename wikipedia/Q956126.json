Production duties were handed to Glyn Johns, and the album was reconceived as a single LP, and released as Combat Rock in May 1982. Though filled with offbeat songs, experiments with sound collage, and a spoken word vocal by Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, it contained two \"radio friendly\" tracks. The leadoff single in the US was \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\", released in June 1982. Another Jones feature in a rock and roll style similar to \"Train in Vain\", it received heavy airplay on AOR stations. The follow-up, \"Rock the Casbah\", put lyrics addressing the Iranian clampdown on imports of Western music to a bouncy dance rhythm. (The singles were released in the opposite order in the UK, where they were both preceded by \"Know Your Rights\".) The music for \"Rock the Casbah\" was composed by Headon, who performed not only the percussion but also the piano and bass heard on the recorded version. It was the band's biggest US hit ever, charting at number 8, and the video was put into heavy rotation by MTV.

The album reached No.\u00a01 in the UK and No.\u00a04 in the US. \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" are early examples of synthesizer use in rock, featuring keyboard sounds generated in real time by a Lowrey organ; on \"Won't Get Fooled Again\", it was further processed through a VCS3 synthesizer. The synthesizer intro to \"Baba O'Riley\" was programmed based on Meher Baba's vital stats, and the track featured a violin solo by Dave Arbus.

Released on June 1, 1972, Eagles was a breakthrough success, yielding three Top 40 singles. The first single and lead track, \"Take It Easy\", was a song written by Frey with his then-neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker Jackson Browne. Browne had written the first verse of the song, but got stalled on the second verse after the line \"I'm standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.\" Frey completed the verse, and Browne carried on to finish the song. The song reached number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was followed by the bluesy \"Witchy Woman\" and the soft country rock ballad \"Peaceful Easy Feeling\", charting at number 9 and number 22 respectively.

The Eagles initially started with Glyn Johns as the producer for this album, but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their double-edged music. After completing only two usable songs, the band turned to Bill Szymczyk to produce the rest of the album. Szymczyk wanted a harder-edged guitarist for the song \"Good Day in Hell\" and the band remembered Bernie Leadon's childhood friend Don Felder, a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for Yes in Boston. Felder had been nicknamed \"Fingers\" at the jam by Frey, a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency. In January 1974, Frey called Felder to add slide guitar to the song \"Good Day in Hell\" and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day. He appeared on one other song on the album, the up-tempo breakup song \"Already Gone\", on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey. \"Already Gone\" was released as the first single from the album and it reached number 32 on the charts. On the Border yielded a number 1 Billboard single (\"Best of My Love\"), which hit the top of the charts on March 1, 1975. The song was the Eagles' first of five chart-toppers.

The edit is so precise that it appears to be a continuous take, achieving the ending the Beatles had desired all along.
