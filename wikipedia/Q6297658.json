Their younger son Adam is played by Nicholas Lyndhurst, and their elder son Russell by Andrew Hall. Throughout all four series, there is a continuing subplot running in tandem with the main storyline, tracking the difficulties faced by young adolescent men coming of age in the UK at a time when there were relatively few employment opportunities. Both of the Parkinson sons are seen making fun of their father's traditional post-war reserved British attitude, whilst also facing their own issues such as unemployment, girlfriend troubles, cannabis use against the wishes of their horrified father, and teenage pregnancy, when Russell fathers a child with his on-off girlfriend. Bruce Montague plays Ria's friend Leonard, a successful businessman aged 44, whose wife has recently left him; he, like Ria, is approaching a mid-life crisis. The show also featured two recurring minor characters: Leonard's chauffeur and confidant Thomas (Michael Ripper) and the Parkinsons' cleaner, Ruby (Joyce Windsor), who often lends Ria an ear."]}, {"page": "Doomwatch", "response": ["Cast: John Paul as Dr Spencer Quist, Simon Oates as Dr John Ridge, John Nolan as Geoff Hardcastle, Simon Cain as Soldier, Barrie Cookson as Wilson, Leslie Meadows as Reggie, David Lincoln as Dave, Victor Platt as Joe Bates, Arthur Brough as Sandy Larch, Anthony Sagar as Sergeant Harris, Peter Welch as Tom Hedley, Sheila Raynor as Mrs. Smith, Joyce Windsor as Mrs. Hunter, Kim Butcher as Child, Geoffrey Palmer as Major Sims, Bill Stratton as Sergeant, Michael Elwyn as Duncan, the BBC thanks the 7 Field Squadron, Royal Engineers for their co-operation."]}, {"page": "She'll Follow You Anywhere", "response": ["* Joyce Windsor ...
