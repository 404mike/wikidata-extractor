Falsely accused of a doping offence, she professed her innocence and was later fully exonerated following an appeal. She returned to competition in 1996, and won a bronze medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Her career best 800 m time of 1:58.65 in 1990, ranks her 11th on the UK all-time list.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 17", "response": ["*  1966   \u2013 Diane Modahl, English runner"]}, {"page": "Sale, Greater Manchester", "response": ["Sale Harriers Manchester Athletics Club was formed in 1911, but is now based in nearby Wythenshawe.
