As critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of  critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy.\"Kelly, 156. In Jane Austen and the War of Ideas (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"estate\" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations.Todd, 34. Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book Reflections on the Revolution in France had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work.Irvine, 116. Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character.Irvine, 116\u201317. Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental \"cult of sensibility\" came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism.Irvine, 117. Butler argued that a novel like Sense and Sensibility, where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics. Irvine pointed out that the identification of the \"cult of sensibility\" with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics. Butler wrote \"the characteristic recourse of the conservative\u00a0... is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole.Irvine, 117 Irvine wrote that a novel like Sense and Sensibility appears to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like Pride and Prejudice does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything, and who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.Irvine, 118"]}, {"page": "List of rectors of Exeter College, Oxford", "response": ["*Marilyn Butler (1993\u20132004)"]}, {"page": "Frankenstein", "response": ["* Shelley, Mary Frankenstein: 1818 text (Oxford University Press, 2009).

Among these were Robert Nye, who wrote that it shows \"Peacock at the height of his powers...a demigod on a spree\", and A. Martin Freeman, who thought it \"perhaps the completest statement of his point of view\", showing Peacock \"at the summit of his achievement...absolutely at his ease, a master of his subject and of English prose\".  Bryan Burns thought that \"as a piece of story-telling which mingles celebration with attack, a subdued but trenchant treatment of themes of authority and individual freedom and an admirable achievement of style, it is hard to equal in the rest of Peacock's oeuvre.\"  Marilyn Butler considered it \"his very best strictly political book \u2013 and that is to place it high among political satires in English\".  J. B. Priestley declared that \"to read it once is inevitably to read it again\".  On the other hand,  Carl Dawson felt that the contemporary references, though they made the book relevant to Peacock's contemporaries, dated the book for later readers: \"Elphin is a type of novel that has to be rewritten for each generation.  Its equivalent in our own day is perhaps T. H. White's The Once and Future King.\"", "There is not total agreement between critics as to the narrative skill displayed in Elphin.  Bryan Burns wrote of \"the insouciance and diversity of its story-telling...there is real command in the spacing and contrasting of episodes, the organizing of space and the economy and poise of individual scenes\", while Marilyn Butler judged that of all Peacock's books Elphin has the strongest plot, but Priestley on the contrary believed that \"he has no sense of narration, of the steady march forward of events, of the way in which action can be ordered to produce the best effect\".  One of his objections was that \"the action is continually held up by the songs, of which there are far too many\".  The critic Olwen W. Campbell agreed that these \"long and tedious adaptations of bardic songs\" interrupted the story, but Bryan Burns, while objecting to the \"mannerly loftiness\" Peacock shared with other minor poets of his period, thought these songs served a useful purpose in the story as outlets for romantic sentiment and local colour.  There is wide agreement that the original poems in Elphin are superior to the translations and imitations, and that \"The War-Song of Dinas Vawr\", later taken up and adapted by T. H. White in The Once and Future King, is the best of them."]}, {"page": "Rose Mary Crawshay Prize", "response": ["|Marilyn Butler"]}, {"page": "Miss American Beauty 1963", "response": ["| Marilyn Butler  "]}, {"page": "Styles and themes of Jane Austen", "response": ["Marilyn Butler and Alastair Duckworth have made the case for Austen as a conservative writer. Butler argues that one measure of a conservative writer is \"whether the plot, broadly, suggests a victim suffering at the hands of society\". Butler argues that Austen's novels are so structured, and thus conservative. She divides Austen's works into two kinds: stories involving a \"Heroine who is Right\" and a spokeswoman for conservative orthodoxy, and stories involving a \"Heroine who is Wrong\" who must learn from her mistakes by recognizing them and resolving to do better. In the novels in which the \"Heroine is Right\", the same process of error, self-knowledge and resolve to follow reason is present, but in another principal character or characters. The \"Heroine who is Right\" helps bring about the change in these other characters.Butler, 165\u2013167. Butler contends that \"Austen's stress upon her heroines' subordinate role in a family, upon their dutifulness, meditativeness, self-abnegation and self-control, were codes shared with other conservative writers, especially women moralists such as Jane West and Mary Brunton. The acquiescent heroine challenges the hero or heroine of novels of the 1790s by reformists such as Bage, Godwin, Holcroft, Hays, and Wollstonecraft, who insist on thinking independently and speaking out.\"", "*Austen, Jane.
