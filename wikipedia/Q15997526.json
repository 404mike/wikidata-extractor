A by-election arose there in 1935 when Lord Scone, the sitting Tory MP,  succeeded his father as Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield and went to the House of Lords.  However at the eleventh hour, the local Liberal Association decided to select the then 76-year-old Francis Norie-Miller, (who had been the Liberal candidate at Perth at the 1931 general election) as they had been told that the Conservatives would be willing to support him as the National government candidate. The decision angered Liberal Party headquarters and they sent the Scottish Liberal Whip, Sir Robert Hamilton, to speak to a meeting of the local Association. The Association ungallantly refused to hear him however and Hamilton issued a statement saying how the decision struck at the very heart of Liberalism in Perth and throughout Scotland. Scott was also understandably unhappy. He said he would have been willing to step aside for Norie-Miller if he had been standing as a Liberal but he was trying to be loyal to a free and independent Liberal Party.The Times, 23 March 1935 In the end, supported in his decision by the party in London whose object was damage-limitation in clashes with the Simonite Liberal Nationals,G J de Groot, Liberal Crusader: The Life of Sir Archibald Sinclair; C.
