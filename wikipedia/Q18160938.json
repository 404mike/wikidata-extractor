After a period working as an errand boy for a doctor (from the age of 12), he was apprenticed to Francis Whisler, a house, coach and sign painter. At about this time he formed a friendship with Robert Ladbrooke, then an apprentice printer. They shared a room and went on sketching trips in the fields and lanes around Norwich.

Its first exhibition opened in 1805, and was such a success that it became an annual event until 1825.

He attended Norwich Grammar School and his early artistic talents encouraged his parents to ask the prominent landscape artist John Crome to take on Joseph as a pupil. Crome was at time Norwich's most famous artist, and his fees proved to be too high for the Stannards, so they paid for their son to be apprenticed by Robert Ladbrooke in the city. Ladbrooke, who had already given him informal lessons, was able to teach the young artist to become a skilled draughtsman, with the potential to develop his own style. Impressed by Stannard's ability, he even waived his tuition fees, offering an annual payment of \u00a310 to entice him to work in his studio. Stannard stayed as Ladbrooke's pupil for seven years, although there is little evidence of his master's influence in his artistic style. When Ladbrooke seceded from the Norwich Society of Artists in 1816, Stannard sided with him. ", "In 1816, Stannard, Robert Ladbrooke and his sons, James Sillett and John Thirtle seceded from the Norwich Society of Artists to form their own society. Led by Ladbrooke, seven members of the Norwich Society opened an exhibition entitled 'The Twelfth of the Norfolk and Norwich Society of Artists', which was held in the Shakespeare Tavern, on Theatre Plain. Stannard exhibited five works in the first year of the new society's existence: Study from Nature; Distant View of Norwich from Whitlingham;.Pencil Sketches; View of the Foundry Bridge and View of the City from Fuller's Hole, exhibiting 13 works with the society in total.

By 1893, the church was not only on the beach, the chancel ruins had been destroyed... The fact that the tower stood until 1895 and formed such a local landmark made it an attraction for early photographers and so we have a number of early plates, most notably the fine image taken by a Mr Fitt, a Norwich photographer c.1890, and which was reproduced and sold in some numbers by him after the tower fell. ... it has been possible to show that the parish church was originally a two-celled building which had a round west tower... and a south aisle subsequently added.
