The leading English artist in the style was John Martin, whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and worked his way through the biblical disasters, and those to come in the final days. Other works such as Delacroix's Death of Sardanapalus included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially Poussin and Rubens, with extra emotionalism and special effects.", "File:John Martin - Sodom and Gomorrah.jpg|John Martin, 1852, The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Laing Art Gallery"]}, {"page": "1789", "response": ["* July 19 \u2013 John Martin, English painter (d. 1854)"]}, {"page": "1854", "response": ["* February 17 \u2013 John Martin, English painter (b. 1789)"]}, {"page": "Paradise Lost", "response": ["Some of the most notable illustrators of Paradise Lost included William Blake, Gustave Dor\u00e9, and Henry Fuseli.
