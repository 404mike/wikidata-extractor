Viking won four straight league titles from 1972 to 1975, as well as the double in 1979. Innovative 1972 manager Kjell Schou-Andreassen has been credited for laying the foundation for the success, with his ideas on cooperative behaviour and his revolutionary use of pacey, attacking full backs Sigbj\u00f8rn Slinning and Anbj\u00f8rn Ekeland. However, the team had a new manager every year, with Sverre Andersen, Stuart Williams and Olav Nilsen leading them to the title in the subsequent years, and Tony Knapp managing the 1979 team. Midfielder Olav Nilsen was also a crucial player on the pitch in the first half of the decade, earning the nickname \"Olav Viking\", while fellow midfielder Svein Kvia was awarded the Norwegian Player of the Year title on several occasions. Arvid Knutsen, Reidar Goa, Hans Edgar Paulsen, Erik Johannessen, Inge Valen, Johannes Vold, Svein Hammer\u00f8, Gunnar Berland and Trygve Johannessen were other key players.", "*  Stuart Williams (1974)"]}, {"page": "Jack Kelsey", "response": ["Kelsey also became a regular first choice keeper for Wales, making his debut in 1954, winning 41 caps in total.

With the help of Kelsey, Wales did not concede a goal for 70 minutes against the Brazilians, until a shot by Pel\u00e9 deflected off Welsh player Stuart Williams managed to beat Kelsey.
