Manager Brian Tinnion described him as \"..a left-sided central defender, a tough character who will inspire.\" He made 13 league and cup appearances for Bristol City in the 2005\u20132006 season but following the arrival of Gary Johnson as manager and a breach of club discipline for which Partridge and other players were fined two weeks' wages after being arrested on suspicion of violent disorder following an incident in a nightclub in October 2005, he was sent out on loan to Milton Keynes Dons in January 2006 until the end of the season. He was transfer listed in May 2006 after returning from Milton Keynes Dons and joined Leyton Orient on a one-month loan at the start of the 2006\u20132007 season with a view to a permanent transfer. However, in September 2006, he was sentenced to two months in prison alongside teammates Bradley Orr and Steve Brooker for his part in the \"drink-fuelled brawl\" at a nightclub in the previous October. He was released after one month but was unable to win back a first-team place at Bristol City and joined Brentford on a one-month loan in January 2007. On his third appearance for Brentford against Yeovil, he was sent off for headbutting and subsequently his loan spell was not extended. Partridge returned to Bristol City and then joined Swindon Town on a one-month loan in March 2007. His lack of fitness however meant that he did not make an appearance for Swindon and he returned to Bristol City the following month. A broken hand suffered during the summer of 2007 meant that he missed all of pre-season training and was ruled out of the start of the 2007\u201308 season.

He started in a 2\u20131 League Cup defeat to Cheltenham on 22 August but it was a 3\u20131 win against Northampton Town that was to change his fortunes. Right-back Bradley Orr was sent off on the stroke of half-time after brawling with and attempting to headbutt his own teammate, Louis Carey. Keogh was brought on at half-time as City went on to score twice to win the match.
