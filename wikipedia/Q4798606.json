He was the third of six children of Tom Emmett and Grace Emmett.\nEmmett was a medium pace bowler who played three first-class matches for Leicestershire County Cricket Club during the 1902 English cricket season. He returned his best figures of 3/48 against London County at Aylestone Road, Leicester, where his victims included the former Australian captain, Billy Murdoch. His third and final appearance was at Lord's against the Marylebone Cricket Club.Emmett's father, Tom, captained Yorkshire between 1878 and 1882, and played seven Test matches for England, including the inaugural Test match in 1877.\nHe died on 12 November 1935 in Evington, Leicestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Emmett", "response": ["Arthur Emmett may refer to:", "*Arthur Emmett (judge) (born 1943), judge of the Federal Court of Australia", "*Arthur Emmett (cricketer) (1869\u20131935), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Reginald Crawford (cricketer)", "response": ["A month later, Crawford improved on his best score: in the match against Worcestershire at Aylestone Road cricket ground, Leicester, he and the bowler William Odell came together with Leicestershire at 61 for eight wickets and proceeded to put on 160 for the ninth wicket. The partnership remains, 111 years on, Leicestershire's best in first-class cricket for the ninth wicket and is 75 years older than any of the county's other first-class partnership records. Crawford was left unbeaten on 99 when first Odell was run out and then, one run later, the No 11 batsman, Arthur Emmett, was also run out, without scoring. Crawford never achieved a century in first-class cricket; the 99 not out remained his best score."]}]}}
