The name was also chosen in opposition to certain strands of so-called radical theology, for example those of John Shelby Spong; those strands asserted a highly liberal version of Christian faith where certain doctrines, for example the Trinity  were denied in an attempt to respond to modernity: in contrast to this, radical orthodoxy attempted to show how the orthodox interpretation of Christian faith (as given primarily in the ecumenical creeds) was the more radical response to contemporary issues and more rigorous and intellectually sustainable."]}, {"page": "Graham Ward (theologian)", "response": ["*(Edited, with John Milbank and Catherine Pickstock) Radical Orthodoxy: a New Theology (Routledge, 1998), "]}, {"page": "Faculty of Divinity, University of Cambridge", "response": ["*Catherine Pickstock"]}, {"page": "Duns Scotus", "response": ["In recent years, this criticism of Scotus has become disseminated in particular through the writings of the 'Radical Orthodox' group of theologians, drawing on John Milbank and Catherine Pickstock.

Both thinkers cite Ord. 1, d. 3, pars 1, q. 3, n. 163, in which Scotus claims that \"This [univocally] is how all the authoritative passages one might find on this topic in the Metaphysics or Physics should be interpreted: in terms of the ontological diversity of those things to which the concept is attributed, which is compatible with there being one concept that can be abstracted from them\".
