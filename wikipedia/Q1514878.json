Hambling's editing of three films, The Commitments (1991), Mississippi Burning (1988), and Midnight Express (1978), has been honored by BAFTA Awards for Best Editing.\n\nIn 1976, Hambling began a notable collaboration with the director Alan Parker that extended over nearly all of Parker's films. The three BAFTA awards noted above were all for films directed by Parker. Chris Routledge has described their collaboration as follows:The collaboration with Parker has ranged widely, from the musical Bugsy Malone, through the partly animated Pink Floyd The Wall, to the grim Angel Heart and the strange story of The Road to Welville. They have been particularly successful with musicals, Hambling's talent for creating the illusion of movement proving useful where musical performances appear in films such as The Commitments, which Lawrence O'Toole called \"a great swim for the eyeballs.\" Perhaps because of their experience in advertising, Parker's slick and striking images combine well with Hambling's intuitive sense of pace and rhythm, for example in the otherwise problematic Fame, and in the much trailed, but poorly received Evita.\nIn addition to the three BAFTA Awards, Hambling had been nominated for the BAFTA award for three additional films (Fame, Another Country, and Evita). Six films edited by Hambling were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (Midnight Express, Fame, Mississippi Burning, The Commitments, In the Name of the Father, and Evita). Hambling had been elected to membership in the American Cinema Editors. Mississippi Burning won the ACE Eddie Award, and in 1998 Hambling was honored by the American Cinema Editors Career Achievement Award.\nHe died in 2013 at the age of 86.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Film Editing", "response": ["| Gerry Hambling ", "| Gerry Hambling", "| Gerry Hambling", "| Gerry Hambling", "| Gerry Hambling", "| Gerry Hambling", "| Gerry Hambling", "*0: Gerry Hambling (6)"]}, {"page": "Midnight Express (film)", "response": ["| Gerry Hambling", "| Gerry Hambling"]}, {"page": "Mississippi Burning", "response": ["The studio then began its search for a director.

After completing the first draft in September 1985, Parker traveled to Rome, Italy, where he brought the script to Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna. The two producers agreed to finance the film through their independent film studio, Carolco Pictures, and Parker was given creative control. Pre-production work on Angel Heart began in January 1986 in New York, where Parker selected the creative team, reuniting with several of his past collaborators, including producer Alan Marshall, director of photography Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts, production designer Brian Morris and editor Gerry Hambling."]}, {"page": "Birdy (film)", "response": ["Parker originally planned to shoot scenes in Oakland, California, before visiting the actual Philadelphia locations described in the novel.
