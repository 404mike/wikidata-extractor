As a songwriter and producer in the 1960s and '70s he had numerous hits in pop, rock, and folk styles; including records with Them, The Dubliners, Sydney Devine, Twinkle, and Lena Zavaroni.\nFrom the 1980s onwards he has sung and recorded traditional Scottish music.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lena Zavaroni", "response": ["Zavaroni was discovered in the summer of 1973 by record producer Tommy Scott, who was on holiday in Rothesay and heard her singing in a band with her father and uncle.

By then Cluskey was her ex-boyfriend: Twinkle dated Peter Noone in 1965.

The song \"Hey Girl\" has a pastoral feel to it, enhanced by the addition of flutes and in Brian Hinton's opinion is a \"dry run for 'Cyprus Avenue'\" from Astral Weeks.
