His book Insanity Fair (1938) examined the state of Europe and the megalomania of Adolf Hitler before the Second World War. By the time of his death, Reed had been largely forgotten except for various remarks about Jews. Thus, when The Times ran his obituary, it condemned Reed as a \"virulent anti-Semite,\" although Reed himself claimed that he drew a distinction between opposition to Zionism and antisemitism. Reed believed in a long-term Zionist conspiracy to impose a world government on an enslaved humanity. He was also staunchly anti-Communist, and once wrote that National Socialism was a \"stooge or stalking horse\" meant to further the aims of the \"Communist Empire.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of the Jews in Russia", "response": ["In Russia, both historical and contemporary antisemitic materials are frequently published.
