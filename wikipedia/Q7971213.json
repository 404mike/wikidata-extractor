In early life he was landlord of the Red Lion Inn, near old St. Luke's Hospital, and, though he failed there in business, soon gained profit and notoriety by his feats of strength. His first public exhibition consisted in pulling against a horse while lying on his back with his feet against the dwarf wall that divided Upper and Lower Moorfields. On 10 July 1734, a concert at Stationers' Hall, given for his benefit, was diversified by his herculean performances, and the woodcut on an extant programme (Burney Coll., Brit. Mus.) shows the strong man lying extended between two chairs, with a glass of wine in his right hand, and five gentlemen standing on his body. About this time, or later, he became landlord of the Duke's Head, a public-house in Cadd's Row (afterwards St. Alban's Place), near Islington Green.Warwick William Wroth, Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 57, p.56"]}, {"page": "Henry Perronet Briggs", "response": ["William Thackeray regarded Briggs as \"out and out the best portrait-painter of the set\"; though the Dictionary of National Biography entry (1886), by Warwick William Wroth, was more circumspect, commenting that \"the pictures painted by Briggs, though not without merits of construction, cannot be said to belong to the highest class of art\"."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London", "response": ["*Warwick William Wroth (1858\u20131911)"]}, {"page": "Warwick Wroth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Warwick William Wroth"]}, {"page": "William Woty", "response": ["* \u2018The Blossoms of Helicon,\u2019 1763.
