Celtic and Charlton Athletic had also been interested in the player, but Stokes revealed that he was greatly influenced by Sunderland manager and former Irish international, Roy Keane, in making his ultimate decision. Stokes was originally handed the 26 shirt at Sunderland, but after the departure of Jon Stead to Sheffield United he was given the number 9 shirt. Stokes made his Sunderland debut a few days later, and crossed to set up David Connolly to give Sunderland a one-goal win over Ipswich.

The goal was a flicked header at the near post from a corner and turned out to be the match winner as it gave Coventry a 3\u20131 lead. In mid-November Cranie found himself in an unfamiliar role as a right-back and on the bench, slipping down to the pecking order following the arrival of Leon Barnett and Richard Wood. Cranie then provided an assist for Jon Stead, which turned out to be the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over Peterborough United on 6 March 2010. Ahead of a match against Middlesbrough on 24 April 2010, Cranie suffered a knee injury in training, but eventually recovered and was in the squad, which played to a 1\u20131 draw. Cranie later regained his first team place making forty league appearances for the club in his first season."]}]}}
