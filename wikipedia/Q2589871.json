The Oxford Companion to British History (1997) explained that Tawney made a \"significant impact\" in all four of these \"interrelated roles\". A. L. Rowse goes further by insisting that \"Tawney exercised the widest influence of any historian of his time, politically, socially and, above all, educationally\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Historiography", "response": ["R.

The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century (1912)William Rose Ben\u00e9t (1988) p.\u00a0961 and Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in Max Weber's thesis on the connection between the appearance of Protestantism and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the 'Storm over the Gentry' in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by Hugh Trevor-Roper and John Cooper."]}, {"page": "Historian", "response": ["Marxist historiography developed as a school of historiography influenced by the chief tenets of Marxism, including the centrality of social class and economic constraints in determining historical outcomes. Friedrich Engels wrote The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which was salient in creating the socialist impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the Fabian Society. R. H.

A circle of historians inside the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of British Marxist historians, who contributed to history from below and class structure in early capitalist society. Members included Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson."]}, {"page": "Marc Bloch", "response": ["In 1930, both keen to make a move to Paris, Febvre and Bloch applied to the \u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes for a position: both failed. Three years later Febvre was elected to the Coll\u00e8ge de France. He moved to Paris, and in doing so, says Fink, became all the more aloof. This placed a strain on Bloch's and his relations, although they communicated regularly by letter and much of their correspondence is preserved. In 1934, Bloch was invited to speak at the London School of Economics. There he met Eileen Power, R. H. Tawney and Michael Postan, among others. While in London, he was asked to write a section of the Cambridge Economic History of Europe; at the same time, he also attempted to foster interest in the Annales among British historians. He later told Febvre in some ways he felt he had a closer affinity with academic life in England than that of France. For example, in comparing the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale with the British Museum, he said that"]}, {"page": "Socialism", "response": ["Principles that can be described as ethical or liberal socialist have been based upon or developed by philosophers such as John Stuart Mill, Eduard Bernstein, John Dewey, Carlo Rosselli, Norberto Bobbio and Chantal Mouffe.

Also, he made a close personal friendship with Arthur and Eveline M. Burns."]}, {"page": "John Beaglehole", "response": ["After three years of post-graduate study Beaglehole obtained his PhD with a thesis on British colonial history. At this time he was much influenced by left-wing teachers, especially R. H. Tawney and Harold Laski, and on returning to New Zealand he found it difficult to obtain an academic post owing to his radical views. For a time he had various jobs including a spell as a Workers Educational Association lecturer, and had time to develop other enthusiasms including civil rights issues, writing poetry, and music, an interest inherited from his mother. In 1932 he took a temporary position as a lecturer in history at Auckland University College, but within months the position was abolished in a retrenchment by the college council. Many believed the decision was due more to the college's reaction to Beaglehole's reputation (albeit exaggerated) for radicalism. His academic career finally took off in 1934 after the publication of his first major book, The Exploration of the Pacific, after which he developed his specialist interest in James Cook. He became lecturer, later professor, at the Victoria University College."]}, {"page": "Mixed economy", "response": ["The American system initially proposed by the first United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and supported by later US leaders such as Henry Clay, John C Calhoun, and Daniel Webster exhibited the traits of a mixed economy combining protectionism, laissez-faire, and infrastructure spending. By 1914 and the start of World War I Germany had developed a mixed economy with government co-ownership of infrastructure and industry along with a comprehensive social welfare system. After the 1929 stock crash and subsequent Great Depression threw much of the global economy into a severe economic decline, British economists such as John Maynard Keynes began to advocate for economic theories which argued for more government intervention in the economy. Harold Macmillan, a conservative politician in the British Tory Party also began to advocate for a mixed economy in his books Reconstruction (1933) and The Middle Way (1938). Supporters of the mixed economy, included R. H. Tawney, Anthony Crosland and Andrew Shonfield who were mostly associated with the Labour Party. During the post-war period and coinciding Golden Age of Capitalism, there was general worldwide rejection of laissez-faire economics as capitalist countries embraced mixed-economies founded on economic planning, intervention, and welfare."]}, {"page": "Hugh Trevor-Roper", "response": ["As a historian of early modern Britain, Trevor-Roper was known for his disputes with fellow historians such as Lawrence Stone and Christopher Hill, whose materialist (and in some measure \"inevitablist\") explanations of the English Civil War he attacked.

Tawney and Stone, about whether the English gentry were, economically, on the way down or up, in the century before the English Civil War and whether this helped cause that war."]}, {"page": "J. A.

He returned to Germany only once, for a few short days twenty years later. In Paris, he married Marie (Miriam) Bernsohn, a widow with a young child, whom he had known previously in Germany. He adopted his wife's son, Thomas, and later his sister's child, Jenny Strauss Clay, later a professor of classics at the University of Virginia; he and Miriam had no biological children of their own. At his death, he was survived by Thomas, daughter Jenny Strauss Clay, and three grandchildren. Strauss became a lifelong friend of Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve and was on friendly terms with Raymond Aron, Alexandre Koyr\u00e9, and \u00c9tienne Gilson. Because of the Nazis' rise to power, he chose not to return to his native country. Strauss found shelter, after some vicissitudes, in England, where, in 1935 he gained temporary employment at University of Cambridge, with the help of his in-law, David Daube, who was affiliated with Gonville and Caius College.
