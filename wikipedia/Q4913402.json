He impressed Wrexham manager Les McDowall enough to earn a professional footballing apprenticeship on wages of \u00a35-a-week. He spent the 1949\u201350 season playing for the reserve team in the Cheshire County League. McDowall moved on to manage Manchester City in June 1950 and invited Grainger to take a tour of Maine Road in an attempt to poach him away from Wrexham, an attempt that was thwarted when the Wrexham board heard of the news and reassured Grainger that he would be sold on to a bigger club if he first proved himself at Wrexham. However he was called up for National Service in 1951 and spent the next two years serving in the Royal Air Force. He turned professional with Wrexham on his 17th-birthday, seeing an increase in wages to \u00a38-a-week, in addition to a \u00a310 signing-on fee. He made his first-team debut on 24 February 1951, taking Billy Tunnicliffe's spot at outside-left in a Third Division North match against Hartlepools United at the Racecourse Ground, which ended in a 1\u20130 home victory. His National Service limited his first-team chances under manager Peter Jackson, and he failed to make an appearance in the 1951\u201352 season, before playing just four games of the 1952\u201353 campaign."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Billy Tunnicliffe"]}, {"page": "Tunnicliffe", "response": ["*Billy Tunnicliffe (1920-1997), British footballer", "*Billy Tunnicliffe (footballer born 1864) (1864- ?), British footballer "]}, {"page": "William Francis Tunnicliffe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Tunnicliffe"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Billy Tunnicliffe", "|\u2013||MF||||Billy Tunnicliffe||0||0||1||1"]}, {"page": "1937\u201338 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Billy Tunnicliffe", "| May 1938 || FW ||  || Billy Tunnicliffe || Bournemouth || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Billy Tunnicliffe (1920\u20131997), played for Wrexham."]}, {"page": "1939\u201340 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Billy Tunnicliffe", "|2||MF||||Billy Tunnicliffe||10||0||0||10"]}]}}
