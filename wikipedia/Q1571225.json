He occupied a unique position amongst the English architects of the latter half of the 19th century, his long mastership of the architectural school at the Royal Academy of Arts having given him the opportunity of moulding and shaping the minds of more than a generation of students.

George John Blomfield (d. 1900), was rector. His mother, Isabella, was a first cousin of his father and the second daughter of the Rt. Rev. Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London. He was brought up in Kent, where his father became rector of Dartford in 1857 and then of Aldington in 1868. He was educated at Highgate School in North London, whose Grade 2 listed War Memorial he later designed, and then Haileybury school in Hertfordshire, and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he took a first-class degree in classics. At Oxford, he attended John Ruskin's lectures, but found \"the atmosphere of rapt adoration with which Ruskin and all he said was received by the young ladies... was altogether too much for me\". Although he had a clear leaning towards the polite arts, his family did not have the means to sustain him as a gentleman artist, and Blomfield at this date had no clear career. After Oxford, he spent a year travelling on the continent as a tutor before accepting an offer from his maternal uncle, Sir Arthur Blomfield, to become an articled pupil in his London practice in the autumn of 1881. He also enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools, where Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers was Master of the Architectural School. He found the atmosphere in his uncle's office uncongenial and the practice's traditional Gothic Revival output hard and soulless, although he gained valuable mechanical skills at draughtsmanship and site experience. He prospered more at the Academy Schools, taking the junior prize in 1882 and the senior prize the following year, with a design for a town house in the fashionable Queen Anne Revival style, of which he was later ashamed. During his years in his uncle's office, the practice produced two uncharacteristic schemes (for work at Marlborough College and Shrewsbury School) that appear to foreshadow Blomfield's enthusiasm for classicism, and in the design of which he was presumably involved. He was an occasional cricketer and played in matches with J. M. Barrie's Allahakbarries XI."]}, {"page": "Chateau Impney", "response": ["Situated in extensive landscaped gardens, Impney Hall, as it was previously known, was designed from 1869 onwards and built in 1873\u201375 for local industrialist the saltworks magnate John Corbett in the style of a Louis XIII ch\u00e2teau. It was a gift for Corbett's wife, Hannah Eliza O'Meara, who was of mixed French/Irish descent and had been raised in Paris, where her father was secretary to the Diplomatic Corps.\"More relevant may have been his desire to cock a snook at his political rival, Sir John Pakington of Westwood House\", observes Pevsner . The family seat of the Pakingtons was Westwood House which is located about a mile away and had been compared by the antiquarian T.R. Nash to the Chateau de Madrid in  Paris. Corbett applied for designs to the Parisian architect Auguste Tronquois, and employed the Beaux-Arts trained English architect Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers as executive architect on site;\"The contribution of the executive architect, Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers, should not be underestimated; he was one of the very few London architects with Beaux Arts training\", Pevsner cautioned . the house cost GBP \u00a3247,000 (equivalent to \u00a316,685,895.00 in 2007),  to satisfy her nostalgia for Paris. Sadly, the marriage was not a happy one, and she later took up residence in one of Corbett's properties in Tywyn, North Wales."]}, {"page": "William Bell Dinsmoor", "response": ["Dinsmoor graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Science degree (1906).  After working in an architectural firm, he joined the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece in 1908 and became the School's architect in 1912.  Dinsmoor joined the faculty of Columbia University in 1919. In 1927\u20131928 he was the architectural consultant for the construction of the interior of a full-scale concrete replica of the Parthenon in Nashville, Tennessee.  He then returned to the American School as a professor of architecture (1924\u20131928). He was married to Zillah Frances Pierce (1886\u20131960).  During the years in Athens, he wrote his magnum opus, a rewritten edition of the Architecture of Ancient Greece by William James Anderson (1844\u20131900) and Richard Phen\u00e9 Spiers (1838\u20131916); it first appeared in 1927 and would go to three editions and be a mainstay for the teaching of Greek architecture through the twentieth century. In 1909, Dinsmoor visited Kardaki Temple in Corfu and subsequently published his findings in a brief paper. In 1934, following the resignation of S. Butler Murray, the Department of Fine Arts at Columbia was reorganized and Dinsmoor became chairman.  He held this position until 1955. During the mid-1930s, Dinsmoor took on a celebrated debate on the configuration of the three phases of the Parthenon with the eminent Acropolis scholar Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld.  In 1935 he was named professor of archaeology at Columbia University.  Between 1936 and 1946 he was president of the Archaeological Institute of America. During World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed Dinsmoor chair of  the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas.  For much of his career he taught at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens.  He retired from Columbia University in 1963.  In 1969 he was awarded the gold medal for his archaeological achievements by the Archaeological Institute of America. He died of a stroke while in Athens, Greece on July 2, 1973."]}, {"page": "John James Burnet", "response": ["He trained for two years in his father's architectural offices.

Burnet's parents were at first reluctant to send their son to a Catholic country which had been subject to the political turmoil of the Paris Commune that year, but in 1872 he began studying under Jean-Louis Pascal, Spiers' former teacher. He progressed rapidly and in 1876, gained his Dipl\u00f4me du Gouvernement in architecture and engineering.There is some uncertainty about Burnet's dates in Paris; different sources give 1872 or 1874 He also spent time there as an assistant to Fran\u00e7ois Rolland.
