He had his first big stage success with Ages Ago (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert, for the small Gallery of Illustration; it ran well and was repeatedly revived. Clay, a great friend of his fellow composer Arthur Sullivan, introduced the latter to Gilbert, leading to the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership.\nIn addition to Gilbert, Clay's librettists during his 24-year career included B. C. Stephenson, Tom Taylor, T. W. Robertson, Robert Reece and G. R. Sims. The last of his four pieces with Gilbert was Princess Toto (1875), which had short runs in the West End and in New York. Clay's other compositions include cantatas and numerous individual songs. His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, The Merry Duchess and The Golden Ring. He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at the age of 44 and ended his career.\nThe historian Kurt G\u00e4nzl has called Clay \"the first significant composer of the modern era of British musical theatre\", but even his most successful stage works were soon eclipsed by those of Gilbert and Sullivan. During his lifetime he was best known for his parlour songs, which were familiar throughout Britain.

Ages Ago was also the beginning of a collaboration with the composer Frederic Clay that would last seven years and produce four works.Crowther, Andrew, \"Ages Ago \u2013 Early Days\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 23 August 2011, accessed 21 July 2016 It was at a rehearsal for Ages Ago that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan.Crowther (2011), p. 84 The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan."]}, {"page": "Royal Gallery of Illustration", "response": ["From 1856 to 1873 the gallery was in the hands of the singer and actress Priscilla Horton and her husband German Reed. Their entertainments developed from songs and comedy with piano accompaniment to programmes of short plays and operettas. In deference to respectable mid-Victorian doubts about the propriety of theatres, the Reeds called their productions \"entertainments\", and avoided the use of the words \"theatre\", \"play\" and other theatrical terms. Under the Reeds the gallery played an important part in the development of a new generation of authors, composers and performers. Among the writers whose works the Reeds staged staged were W. S. Gilbert and F. C. Burnand, and their composers included Arthur Sullivan, Frederic Clay and Alfred Cellier. The performers Arthur Cecil, Corney Grain and Fanny Holland made their names at the gallery early in their careers.", "At the gallery the Reeds staged nine pieces by William Brough, seven by F. C. Burnand, and five by W. S. Gilbert, whose Ages Ago (1869, with music by Frederic Clay) was the Reeds' longest-running and most frequently revived production, narrowly outdistancing Burnand and Arthur Sullivan's Cox and Box. Other authors whose works were presented there included Shirley Brooks, Henry Chorley, James Planch\u00e9, Robert Reece, T. W. Robertson, Bolton Rowe and Tom Taylor. Among the composers in addition to Reed, Parry, Macfarren, Sullivan, Gabriel and Clay were Alfred Cellier and James Molloy."]}, {"page": "J. H.

Bancroft, however, decided not to stage the play, giving Burnand more license to freely adapt it.  The \"aesthetic craze,\" was an obvious target for Burnand, who had been a regular contributor to Punch since 1863 and had become its editor in 1880 (a position he held until 1906).  Beginning in the late 1870s, George du Maurier had published a long series of cartoons in the magazine satirizing the aesthetes.Introduction to The Colonel. The Nineteenth-Century Marteau, accessed 9 June 2010Stedman, p. 182  \"The Colonel\" was a recurring character in Punch.cf., e.g., Punch 78 [13 March 1880]: \"Distinguished Amateurs.\u20142. The Art-Critic\"  Punch had so frequently attacked the aesthetic movement, as The Observer noted, that The Colonel came at a point when it \"might, indeed, have been thought that Punch had well nigh played the subject out.\"Observer, 6 February 1881, Supplement, p. 1   Fun, a rival publication, wryly noted that Burnand should have acknowledged du Maurier as co-author.   According to Burnand's memoir, Frederic Clay leaked the information to him that Gilbert and Sullivan were working on an \"\u00e6sthetic subject\", and so Burnand raced to produce the play before the operatic duo's Patience opened.Burnand, vol. 2, p. 165"]}]}}
