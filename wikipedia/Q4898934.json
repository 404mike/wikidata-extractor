Committee members were Wallace Breem, Don Daintree, Betty Moys, Willi Steiner and Derek Way. The 2nd Harrogate Workshop in April concluded with a meeting which set up an Association of Law Librarians. This was the inaugural meeting and those who were present are BIALL\u2019s founder members. The first AGM was held in a basement room of the old IALS building in Russell Square on Monday 22 September. It was chaired by Willi Steiner, several hours were spent debating the minutiae of the draft Constitution. One of the decisions was to form a separate organisation, not affiliated to, or part of, the Library Association, resulting from strong arguments that organisations (especially law firms) who had no professional librarians, would be excluded from membership if the Association were part of the LA. The principle of welcoming professionally qualified and non-qualified law librarians into BIALL has prevailed ever since.", "The first officers were Don Daintree (Chairman), Wallace Breem (Secretary and Treasurer) and Betty Moys (Editor). An Executive Committee was subsequently elected and in November it set up a Sub-Committee of Betty Moys, Allan Appleby of Sweet and Maxwell, and Wallace Breem to produce a journal.", "BIALL administers and presents several awards at its annual conference dinner including the BIALL Supplier of the Year Award, the LexisLibrary Awards (formerly the Halsbury's Awards), the biannual Wallace Breem Award, the Betty Moys Award, the Legal Journals Award, and the Wildy Law Librarian of the Year Award."]}, {"page": "Betty moys", "response": ["#REDIRECT Betty Moys "]}, {"page": "Chislehurst School for Girls", "response": ["* Betty Moys who started the Moys Classification Scheme of legal literature"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth M Moys", "response": ["#REDIRECT Betty Moys"]}, {"page": "Moys Classification Scheme", "response": ["The Moys Classification Scheme is a system of library classification for legal materials.
