He was born in Glasgow, and played for Glasgow Perthshire and Third Lanark, before moving to England to play for Bristol City in the 1890s. He then joined Swindon Town before moving to Manchester United in October 1902. He was able to play in all three half-back positions, and thus earned a regular first-team spot even after being replaced by Dick Duckworth. In 1909, after scoring 14 goals in 191 appearances for United, he moved to Oldham Athletic. In the 1909-10 season, he skippered the Latics to promotion to the First Division.", "link_mentions": {}}}
