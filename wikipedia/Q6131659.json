He plays for and is the assistant manager at Southern League Premier Division Central club Banbury United. He has played in the Football League for Walsall, Shrewsbury Town and Oxford United.\nConstable started his career with the Cirencester Town youth system, before breaking into the first team during the 2002\u201303 season. He moved to Chippenham Town in 2003, before signing for Walsall in the Football League in 2005. He moved out on loan to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in 2006, before signing permanently in 2007. After a year at the club, during which he scored the first club goal at the new Wembley Stadium in the 2007 FA Trophy Final, he returned to the League with Shrewsbury Town. After spending 2008\u201309 on loan at Oxford United, he signed for the club permanently in 2009. Constable scored the second goal in Oxford's 3\u20131 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final victory over York City in 2010, which secured Oxford's promotion into League Two. He was leading goalscorer in each of his six seasons at the club, and when he left after 2013\u201314 he had scored 106 goals, one short of the club record.\nHe has played for the England national C team, who represent England at non-League level, making his debut in 2007 in a 2\u20130 victory over Finland in the International Challenge Trophy. He scored the goal in a 2\u20132 draw with Italy in 2008 that took England to the International Challenge Trophy Final, which Constable played in as England were defeated 1\u20130 by the Belgium under-21 team in 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kidderminster Harriers F.C.", "response": ["In 2007, Kidderminster again reached the final, losing 2\u20133 to Stevenage Borough, despite being 2\u20130 up at half time through two James Constable goals.

During the pre-season, Guy was in fine form, giving manager Darren Patterson cause for optimism. Guy claimed the dressing room atmosphere was a key reason for the impressive summer run. However, in a pre-season friendly with Portsmouth he suffered a hamstring injury, before being struck down by a minor ankle injury. These injuries frustrated attempts to build a strike partnership with James Constable. Following Patterson's departure in late November, Guy was unsure of his future at the Kassam Stadium. A few days later he scored two goals in a game for the first time, in the FA Trophy game with Sudbury and was well fancied by caretaker manager Jim Smith. However, with Chris Wilder's entrance came Guy's departure, as he was recalled to Layer Road at the end of the year. After four games under new Colchester manager Paul Lambert, he joined League Two promotion hopefuls Dagenham & Redbridge, initially on a one-month loan. He made his debut for the club the same evening as he signed, coming on as a late substitute in a 3\u20130 home defeat to Lincoln City on 3 March. After scoring the only goal in a league match against Port Vale at Vale Park seven days later, the \"Daggers\" were keen to extend the deal to the end of the season, which Colchester duly obliged to."]}, {"page": "Justin Richards (footballer)", "response": ["Under the stewardship of Gary Rowett, Richards slipped behind Calvin Zola, Matt Paterson, and Billy Kee in a largely single-striker system in 2012\u201313.

He signed for Oxford on a deal until the end of the 2012\u201313 season on deadline day, 1 February 2013.

Stevenage Borough were the first team to win a final at the new Wembley beating Kidderminster 3\u20132, despite trailing 2\u20130 at half time. The first players to play at both the old and new Wembley Stadiums were Steve Guppy (for Stevenage Borough) and Jeff Kenna (for Kidderminster Harriers).

His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the net for what would have been his first Football League goal.
