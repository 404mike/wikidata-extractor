He made his First Division debut on 8 September 1919 in a 3\u20131 defeat away to Manchester City. Later that year, he was involved in an unpleasant incident in a match at home to Burnley. He kicked the opposing left back, Cliff Jones, who retaliated, and the referee sent Jones off. Reports vary as to whether Dolphin's initial kick was accidental or not; after several minutes' delay, during which the referee was surrounded by arguing players and a few spectators had to be removed from the field, play resumed with a free kick for Burnley. In the reverse fixture a few days later, Dolphin suffered a fracture when he fell awkwardly, landing on his right shoulder, and Burnley's Tommy Boyle landed on him. Jones was suspended for two months for the incident and for refusing to leave the field; Dolphin returned to first-team duty in the 3\u20130 defeat at Sunderland some six weeks later, but played infrequently thereafter."]}]}}
