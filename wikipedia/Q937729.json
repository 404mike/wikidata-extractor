He lived in north London with his wife Helen Oxenbury, another illustrator. His last published work was a husband-and-wife collaboration, There's Going to Be a New Baby (Walker Books, September 2011), written by John and illustrated by Helen for \"ages 2+\".Burningham won the 1963 and 1970 Kate Greenaway Medals for British children's book illustration. The first was for his debut as illustrator (and author), Borka: The Adventures of a Goose with No Feathers, named one of the top ten winning works for the 50th anniversary of the Medal (1955\u20132005). His second Greenaway Medal winner, Mr Gumpy's Outing (1970), is his work most widely held in WorldCat participating libraries, and it also won the annual Boston Globe\u2013Horn Book Award (US) in the picture books category.For his lasting contribution as a children's illustrator, Burningham was one of five or six finalists in 2012 and in 2014 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest recognition available to creators of children's books. He was the UK's national nominee in 1980 and 1986.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang", "response": ["Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car is a children's novel written by Ian Fleming for his son Caspar, with illustrations by John Burningham.

To illustrate the book, Fleming suggested the Daily Mail cartoonist Trog\u2014the pseudonym of Wally Fawkes\u2014as he admired the artist's work. While undertaking the preliminary drawings for the book, Trog tried to make the fudge recipe included in the book and found it was not particularly good: the editors at Jonathan Cape spent a day making up batches from different recipes to find a better one to use. Although Fawkes completed preliminary drawings for the project, the Daily Mail refused to allow him to complete the work as many of Fleming's works were serialised in its rival, the Daily Express. Other early illustrative sketches were produced by artist Haro Hodson and motor engineer Amherst Villiers. After Trog was forced to withdraw from the project, Cape commissioned John Burningham, who had recently won the 1963 Kate Greenaway Medal for his book Borka: The Adventures of a Goose with No Feathers."]}, {"page": "List of years in literature", "response": ["*2019 in literature \u2013 Michel Houellebecq's Serotonin; Bernardine Evaristo's Girl, Woman, Other; Death of John Burningham, Judith Kerr"]}, {"page": "1970 in literature", "response": ["*John Burningham \u2013 Mr Gumpy's Outing"]}, {"page": "Summerhill School", "response": ["* John Burningham, children's author and illustrator"]}, {"page": "Paul Biegel", "response": ["Among the 35 books Paul Biegel translated into Dutch are The Borrowers series by Mary Norton, three books by Michael Foreman, two by John Burningham, three by Tony Ross, and four by Kaye Umansky."]}, {"page": "Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize", "response": ["::* 0\u20135 years: Husherbye by John Burningham (Jonathan Cape)"]}, {"page": "Kate Greenaway Medal", "response": [" | 1970 || John Burningham || Mr Gumpy's Outing || \u2014", " | 1963 *|| John Burningham || Borka: The Adventures of a Goose With No Feathers || \u2014 ", "Only one illustrator, Chris Riddell, has won three Greenaway Medals.
