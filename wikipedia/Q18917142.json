He became delegate senior minister of the West London Synagogue in 1893, when David Woolf Marks retired from active service. Joseph published a collection of sermons, The Ideal in Judaism, London, 1893, and a valuable popular work on Jewish theology, Judaism as Creed and Life, in 1903. His position on Jewish religious belief and practice was conservative, midway between Reform and strict Orthodox.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Movement for Reform Judaism", "response": ["In 1856, tensions in Manchester were increasing, as many in the community sought greater autonomy from the authoritarian new Chief Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler and regarded local Rabbi Solomon Marcus Schiller-Szinessy with disfavour. On 25 March 1858 the dissident \"Manchester Congregation of British Jews\" was dedicated. They adopted Marks' prayerbook but retained the second day of festivals. Their motives were far more political than principally religious. In 1872, a third English synagogue withdrew from Adler's jurisdiction, the Bradford Jewish Association. Unlike the rest, Bradford was clearly influenced by continental developments: the founders were mostly German Jews, as was their first rabbi, Joseph Strauss. The three breakaway congregations were neither organised together nor had a consistent religious philosophy. Marks' \"neo-Karaism\", which was never very important to ordinary constituents in West London, virtually died with him. His successor, Rabbi Morris Joseph, was dismissed by the Orthodox in 1890 for evincing doubt about the prayers concerning the sacrifices but was of little conviction. His moderate style brought a rapprochement with the United Synagogue."]}, {"page": "West London Synagogue", "response": ["With Marks' retirement in 1895, he was replaced by Rabbi Morris Joseph, who abandoned his predecessor's philosophy, which was never very popular with constituents, and brought West London closer to mainland Reform, by removing from the liturgy its petitions for the restoration of sacrifices in Jerusalem."]}, {"page": "Maccabaeans", "response": ["* Rev. Morris Joseph"]}, {"page": "David Woolf Marks", "response": ["His unique approach to Judaism had little impact. Most congregants were little bothered. Two other nonconformist synagogues left the establishment: the Manchester Congregation of British Jews adopted his prayerbook but refused to abolish Second Days. The Bradford Jewish Association did not even do that. Another small association, The Hebrew Reformed Congregation Beth Elohim on the Island of Saint Thomas, used his liturgy during its short existence, from 1867 to 1875. His successor in West London, Reverend Morris Joseph, did not follow his precepts. Marks' \"neo-Karaism\" perished with him. Eventually, under the influence of Claude Montefiore and especially after the installation of Hebrew Union College graduate Harold F. Reinhart in 1929, West London adopted mainstream Reform Judaism and in 1942 became a founding member of the Associated British Synagogues (Movement for Reform Judaism since 2005)."]}, {"page": "Harold Reinhart", "response": ["Reinhard was Rabbi at Reform Jewish congregations in Gary, Indiana, Baton Rouge, Los Angeles and Sacramento, California before moving, in 1929, to the United Kingdom to continue his rabbinical career.
