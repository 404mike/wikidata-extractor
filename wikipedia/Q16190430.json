A. Palmer and Steve Herman), and Crass played their first live gig at a squatted street festival in Huntley Street, North London. They planned to play five songs, but a neighbour \"pulled the plug\" after three. Guitarist Steve Herman left the band soon afterwards, and was replaced by Phil Clancey, aka Phil Free. Joy De Vivre and Eve Libertine also joined around this time. Other early Crass performances included a four-date tour of New York City, a festival gig in Covent Garden and regular appearances with the U.K. Subs at The White Lion, Putney and Action Space in central London. The latter performances were often poorly attended: \"The audience consisted mostly of us when the Subs played and the Subs when we played\".Rimbaud, P; \"...In Which Crass Voluntarily Blow Their Own\", sleeve note essay included with Best Before 1984 album", "*Phil Free (guitar)"]}]}}
