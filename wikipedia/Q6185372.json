Arrested by the Gestapo in 1943, he was imprisoned in the infamous Pawiak prison and then sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. Transferred to Sachsenhausen-Oranienburg he was liberated by American forces on 3 May 1945. In September of that year he joined the Polish II Corps and briefly served in counter-intelligence in Northern Italy. In 1947 he moved to Bodney in the United Kingdom and then settled in London. Working for various BOC branches, he devoted most of his spare time to studies on Polish aviation history, notably the history of Polish armed forces during World War II.\nSince 1953 he started publishing articles in Flight and numerous other journals, including L'Fanatique de l'Aviation, Aerospace Historian, Air Power, Skrzyd\u0142a and Air Progress. He also authored Poland-related chapters of Jane's All the World's Aircraft (1953/54 and 1963/64 editions). After 1956 his articles started to be published also in Poland, notably in Skrzydlata Polska. He also collaborated regularly with the Polish Section of BBC and the Radio Free Europe.\nApart from being a co-author of several aviation encyclopaedias (including Combat Aircraft of the World and The Lore of Flight), he authored and published numerous books on Polish civil and military aviation, as well as Polish aeroplanes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "No. 303 Squadron RAF", "response": ["During the Battle of Britain, No. 303 Squadron was equipped with Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft.

Retrieved 24 March 2012. After a period of training, the squadron was scrambled for the first time on 24 August 1940, although it did not come into contact with any enemy aircraft on this occasion.Bristow, Mark and Sylvia Laidlow-Petersen. A History of Royal Air Force Northolt. RAF Northolt: No. 1 AIDU, 2005. On 30 August 1940, the squadron scored its first victory while still officially non-operational,  when a German Messerschmitt Bf 110 of 4./ZG 76 (initially incorrectly recorded as a Dornier Do 17) was shot down by F/O Ludwik Paszkiewicz during a training flight. The wreck was excavated in 1982.Letter of Jerzy Cynk to Skrzydlata Polska 1/2006 magazine, pp. 61\u201362 (in Polish) After S/L Kellet's personal recommendation, the squadron was declared operational next day by No. 11 Group RAF.", "It also had the highest kill-to-loss ratio; of 2.8:1. However, J. Alcorn was not able to attribute 30\u00a0aircraft shot down to any particular unit, and according to Jerzy Cynk and other Polish historians, the actual number of victories for No. 303 Squadron was about 55\u201360. According to Polish historian Jacek Kutzner the verified number of kills of 303 Squadron is around 58.8, which would still place it above all other squadrons regarding verified kills. This is presented by Kutzner's chart, which shows Polish confirmed kills (left column), confirmed kills of all Allied squadrons, including Polish (central column) and real German losses on each day when No. 303 Squadron was involved in air combats (right column).\"Dywizjon 303.

It should be however noted, that a commanding system introduced by Pi\u0142sudski after his coup d'\u00e9tat was faulty, because it introduced two independent branches of command: peacetime and wartime one. The chief of the Aviation Department and commander of the Air Force was only a peacetime administrative duty, subordinated to the Ministry of War, while strategic planning was to be fulfilled by the wartime branch, the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces (GISZ), and general staff. The Inspectorate itself was not interested in military aviation much and was reluctant to work out a modern development plan for the Air Force and an appropriate strategic doctrine, giving only general directives instead. Therefore, Rayski had no knowledge on the Polish Air Force expected wartime role and as a result, he realized his own conception, without proper assessment of real needs. Only in 1936 the Air Defence Inspectorate was created, led by gen. J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105c, who became in conflict with Rayski. Jerzy B. Cynk, Dowodzenie Lotnictwem Wojskowym II Rzeczypospolitej in: Lotnictwo nr 5/2004 As one of mistakes is regarded support for too ambitious plan of equipping the LOT Polish Airlines with own modern airliner, the PZL.44 Wicher, what was uneconomical, and moreover, delayed development of modern fighters. In early 1930s Polish fighters of Zygmunt Pu\u0142awski's design were among the best in the world, but in late 1930s the situation changed, and Rayski was reluctant to order development of successors (better versions of Pulawski's fighters, not restricted by the Polish Air Force choice of engines, were exported with a success). He promoted obsolete PZL.39 project, that was not realized, and the PZL.38 Wilk, a twin-engine heavy fighter-bomber, of a fashionable at that time class, but unable to substitute for interceptor aircraft. Future war showed, that modern single-engine interceptors were crucial aircraft for the air defence. Facing fiasco of both designs, Rayski finally ordered development of PZL.50 Jastrz\u0105b, which was hampered by his arbitrary choice of too weak engine, and appeared too late and mediocre. The other design was a low-performance light fighter PZL.45 project. Jerzy B. Cynk, Polskie lotnictwo wojskowe w okresie mi\u0119dzywojennym. Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 IV in: Lotnictwo nr 11/2004 Other point of criticism was that Rayski, realizing his vision of strong national aerospace industry, intentionally caused bankruptcy of Plage i La\u015bkiewicz factory, while the DWL hardly avoided this fate."]}, {"page": "PZL.50 Jastrz\u0105b", "response": ["Because of the secrecy surrounding the aircraft, for over 65 years its existence was only partly known based on four photographs of fragments of the first prototype, made during a presentation to Ciano, two of which are shown in the book, Polish Aircraft 1893-1939 by Jerzy Cynk, which also contains representative drawings of the aircraft.Cynk  1971, pp. 259\u2013265. Only in 2005 were a couple of photographs discovered that showed two incomplete aircraft at Czerniakowska street.
