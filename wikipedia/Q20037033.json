Enright, an actor living in the United States, had arrived in Syria as a volunteer to fight against ISIS. Matson made claims that Enright was a liability and in danger of being killed by his Kurdish fellow soldiers. He claimed Enright had been kicked out of four units he had been fighting with, and that Enright was there primarily to make a movie. Enright himself denied the claims, saying that he had the support of Kurdish generals, none of his fellow fighters wanted to kill him, and that it was the Kurds that asked him to make movie footage of the conflict. Kurdish military leaders, interviewed for the documentary Heval, refuted Matson's claims, stating that Enright had their support, they had asked him to take the footage, and that he was generally liked by his fellow combatants."]}, {"page": "List of Pirates of the Caribbean cast members", "response": ["| Michael Enright"]}, {"page": "Heval", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Enright (actor)#Heval"]}]}}
