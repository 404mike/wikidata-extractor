Bonnes noted that the film is not a remake of the  1966 horror western film Billy the Kid Versus Dracula, rather it is given a contemporary setting in which director Alan Clarke opposes two very distinct worlds: the wealthy world whose representative is the vampire and the world of destitute and penniless proletarians, whose representative is Billy.

He also stated that Bruce Payne gave a \"delicious\" performance as Harker and that, in his vampiric state, he looked 'somewhat like Max Schreck in Murnau's Nosferatu, but in his humanoid state he exudes nothing but charm'. Kim Newman stated that the film perked up the saga by pitting a nice-guy werewolf (Brendan Hughes) against a \"nasty vampire\" (Bruce Payne). Frederick Clarke described Payne as an \"elegant and suave\" vampire and also noted the Nosferatu allusions. John Ferguson stated that 'Hope Perello's take on the familiar tale, in which a sort of good werewolf battles against an even more hideous band of freaks, actually holds up better than most'. Andrew Pragasm stated that 'by far the strongest of The Howling sequels, film number six takes the time to explore its quirky characters and deepen relationships before getting down to the werewolf versus vampire stuff'. Felix Vasquez stated that the film sought to 'channel Tod Browning\u2019s Freaks mixed with a tacked on werewolf vs. vampire battle, than actually trying to delve in to the werewolf mythos like the former movies'. In Vasquez's view 'in the end, it's just a middling gimmicky sequel, with Bruce Payne giving a charismatic turn as a villain, making up for the forgettable turn by the entire cast, including Brendan Hughes'. Seth Miller stated that 'this sequel has probably some of the most likable characters in the series, as has as some decent make-up effects work, particularly on Harker in vampire form, as well as a character named Winston (Sean Gregory Sullivan), a sympathetic man held against his will in the circus and displayed as the Alligator Boy due to a rare skin decease'. Lawrence Cohn described the film as a tasteless but effective shocker."]}, {"page": "La Femme Nikita (TV series)", "response": ["*Bruce Payne as Jurgen (season 2), a ruthless, brutal high-ranked operative."]}, {"page": "Silence Like Glass", "response": ["Silence Like Glass (German title: Zwei Frauen) is a 1989 German-American drama film.
