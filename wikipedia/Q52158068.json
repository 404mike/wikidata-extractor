It uses 178 LED modules to illuminate the cables, towers, and underside of the deck. The USGS environmental data is translated by specialized software to a processor that issues cues programmed for each of the changing conditions.  The base color is determined by the water's temperature. The timing and intensity of the base color's changes, moving the light across the bridge, are determined by the river's speed. A secondary color pattern is determined by the river's depth, that changes on the two towers and the suspension cables."]}, {"page": "Murch", "response": ["*Anna Valentina Murch (1949\u20132014), artist"]}, {"page": "SECA Art Award", "response": ["*1987: Anna Valentina Murch;"]}, {"page": "Miguel Rodez", "response": ["From 1994 to 2000, Rodez served on the Board of Trustees for Art in Public Places at Miami Dade County, where he was elected the Board\u2019s Chairperson in 1997.
