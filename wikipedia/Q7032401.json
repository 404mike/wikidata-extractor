In the 1993\u201394 season, they finished in their then highest NWCFL placing of fourth. In April 1995, Nantwich defeated Trafford 1\u20130 in the League Cup Final at Gigg Lane, Bury (two years earlier at the same venue Nantwich had lost 2\u20131 to Burscough in the same competition). In 1995, in an F.A. Cup preliminary round tie against Droylsden, Andy Locke scored the fastest ever FA Cup hat-trick, in 2 minutes 20 seconds. This record still stands for a hat-trick in any round of the FA Cup, including the qualifying rounds before the First Round.
