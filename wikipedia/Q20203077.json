Michael Allmand won a posthumous Victoria Cross for his part in the same events. Later, Lucas contracted sandfly fever and was left unconscious in a foxhole with just a gun, some bullets and water. Waking a day or two later, he walked for several days to catch up with his men who were astonished to see him emaciated but alive. He was soon back in action. After the war, Lucas returned to Aylesbury to manage JP Lucas & Co., the family furnishing business.", "link_mentions": {}}}
