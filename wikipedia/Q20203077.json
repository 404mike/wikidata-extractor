Michael Allmand won a posthumous Victoria Cross for his part in the same events. Later, Lucas contracted sandfly fever and was left unconscious in a foxhole with just a gun, some bullets and water. Waking a day or two later, he walked for several days to catch up with his men who were astonished to see him emaciated but alive. He was soon back in action. After the war, Lucas returned to Aylesbury to manage JP Lucas & Co., the family furnishing business.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Lucas", "response": ["John Lucas may refer to:", "*John Lucas (Australian politician) (1818\u20131902), Australian politician in New South Wales", "*John Lucas (MP for Colchester) (by 1512\u20131556), MP for Colchester", "*John Lucas (MP for Gloucester), Member of Parliament in 1311", "*John Lucas II (born 1953), American professional basketball player and head coach", "*John Lucas III (born 1982), American professional basketball player and assistant coach", "*John Lucas (cricketer) (1922\u20132008), West Indian and Canadian cricketer", "*John Lucas (footballer) (1869\u20131953), Australian rules footballer for Geelong", "*Jack Lucas (footballer) (John Lucas, born 1961), Australian rules footballer for Sydney", "*John Lucas (British Army officer) (1921\u20132013), British soldier with the Chindits", "*John Lucas (VC) (1826\u20131892), Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*John Lucas, 1st Baron Lucas of Shenfield (1606\u20131671), English Royalist soldier, industrialist and landowner", "*John Lucas (comics), American comic book artist", "*John Lucas (historian) (1684\u20131750), historian of Warton, Lancashire, England", "*John Lucas (painter) (1807\u20131874), English artist", "*John Lucas (philosopher) (1929\u20132020), British philosopher", "*John Lucas (poet) (born 1937), British poet, critic, travel writer, literary historian, anthologist and publisher", "*John Lucas (priest) (1921\u20131992), Archdeacon of Totnes", "*St. John Lucas (1879\u20131934), English poet"]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** John Lucas, Army officer (died 2013)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2013", "response": ["*John Lucas, 92, British Army officer."]}, {"page": "John Lucas (MC)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Lucas (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "John George Anderson Lucas", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Lucas (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "John Lucas (Indian Army officer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Lucas (British Army officer)"]}]}}
