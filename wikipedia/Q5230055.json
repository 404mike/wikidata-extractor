His first season signings included Mark Leonard from Tranmere Rovers, John Crabbe from Hereford United and David Pullar from Exeter City as Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme. Among his first transfer successes were Dave Waller (sold to Shrewsbury Town), Gary Blissett (sold to Brentford) and Geoff Thomas (sold to Crystal Palace); gradually the club moved forward."]}, {"page": "Paul Hart", "response": ["After the spell at Notts County, Hart was appointed manager of Chesterfield in 1988. Joining the club when they were firmly rooted to the bottom of the Third Division, he reorganised and revitalised the playing side of the club with assistant Chris McMenemy. Thanks especially to a number of notable number of home wins in the first three months of 1989 and a surprising 3\u20131 win at second place Sheffield United in early January, the team climbed out of the bottom four. However, this proved to be only a temporary abatement of the club's problems at that time. Despite bringing great performances from striker Dave Waller, who equalled the club's record for goals in consecutive games \u2013 eight \u2013 Chesterfield were relegated in the penultimate game. The following season saw Chesterfield reach the play-off final at Wembley after spending almost the entire season in the top seven, underlying Hart's ability and promise as a young manager. The team was defeated 0\u20131 by Cambridge United for whom Dion Dublin scored the winning goal. In February 1990, he gave 19-year-old Sean Dyche his Football League debut. Given no funds for squad improvement for the 1990\u201391 season, results and form were extremely indifferent. He was sacked on New Year's Day, 1991."]}, {"page": "Glapwell F.C.", "response": ["After originally playing as the Young Vanish FC in the mid-to-late 1980s, the club played for the first time as Glapwell FC in 1989 when they joined the National League System for the first time playing in the Central Midlands Football League Division One. in 1992\u201393 under manager Roy Overton, and helped by the goalscoring form of former Chesterfield player Dave Waller, the club won the Supreme Division as well as the Wakefield Cup at Field Mill against bitter rivals Oakham United F.C. With Waller in the dugout two seasons later the club finished as runners-up and were finally suitably placed for promotion to the Northern Counties East Football League.

Writing in The Guardian, Cynthia Bateman described that the first half of the match was \"of such little excitement that the Chesterfield fans, too far away to take on the Cambridge supporters, began fighting among themselves\".  Keith Blackmore of The Times suggested that \"for a long time [the game] was not a good advertisement for fourth division football\". Although Cambridge had started the first half strongly, Chesterfield dominated the early stages of the second half.  In the 60th minute, Cambridge made the first substitution of the match with Claridge coming on to replace John Taylor.  Having missed several chances, Dublin scored in the 77th minute to give Cambridge the lead.  Mick Leonard, the Chesterfield goalkeeper, was ruled to have carried the ball out after attempting to catch a misdirected shot, and conceded a corner.  Dublin out-jumped Chesterfield's defenders to head in Leadbitter's set piece and make it 1\u20130.  Almost immediately, Chesterfield replaced Chiedozie with Dave Waller.  With six minutes of the match remaining, Cambridge made their second substitution, with Leadbitter being taken off for Mike Cook.  Chesterfield had chances to score through Plummer and Waller but to no avail.  In the 88th minute, Jamie Hewitt's header was saved by the Cambridge goalkeeper John Vaughan.  Despite late chances to score for both teams, Cambridge secured promotion to the Third Division with a 1\u20130 victory.", "|FW ||12||Dave Waller "]}]}}
