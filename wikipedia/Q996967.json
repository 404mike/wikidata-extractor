She was vice-chairman of the BBC Trust, the governing body of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and was a member of the UK Competition Commission from 2001 until 2019. Since March 2018, she has been the Bennett Professor of Public Policy at the University of Cambridge, co-directing the Bennett Institute.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gross domestic product", "response": ["Instances of GDP measures have been considered numbers that are artificial constructs. In 2020 scientists, as part of a World Scientists' Warning to Humanity-associated series, warned that worldwide growth in affluence in terms of GDP-metrics has increased resource use and pollutant emissions with affluent citizens of the world \u2013 in terms of e.g. resource-intensive consumption \u2013 being responsible for most negative environmental impacts and central to a transition to safer, sustainable conditions. They summarised evidence, presented solution approaches and stated that far-reaching lifestyle changes need to complement technological advancements and that existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption expansion and that the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits societal change. 50px  Text and image were copied from this source, which is available under a  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Sarah Arnold, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation (NEF) stated that \"GDP includes activities that are detrimental to our economy and society in the long term, such as deforestation, strip mining, overfishing and so on\". The number of trees that are net lost annually is estimated to be approximately 10\u00a0billion. The global average annual deforested land in the 2015\u20132020 demi-decade was 10\u00a0million hectares and the average annual net forest area loss in the 2000\u20132010 decade 4.7\u00a0million hectares, according to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020. According to one study, depending on the level of wealth inequality, higher GDP-growth can be associated with more deforestation. In 2019 \"agriculture and agribusiness\" accounted for 24 % of the GDP of Brazil, where a large share of annual net tropical forest loss occurred and is associated with sizable portions of this economic activity domain. The number of obese adults was approximately 600\u00a0million (12%) in 2015. In 2013 scientists reported that large improvements in health only lead to modest long-term increases in GDP per capita. After developing an abstract metric similar to GDP, the Center for Partnership Studies highlighted that GDP \"and other metrics that reflect and perpetuate them\" may not be useful for facilitating the production of products and provision of services that are useful \u2013 or comparatively more useful \u2013 to society, and instead may \"actually encourage, rather than discourage, destructive activities\". Steve Cohen of the Earth Institute elucidated that while GDP does not distinguish between different activities (or lifestyles), \"all consumption behaviors are not created equal and do not have the same impact on environmental sustainability\". Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, noted that \"it's difficult to see if the current G.D.P.-based model of economic growth can go hand-in-hand with rapid cutting of emissions\", which nations have agreed to attempt under the Paris Agreement in order to mitigate real-world impacts of climate change. Some have pointed out that GDP did not adapt to sociotechnical changes to give a more accurate picture of the modern economy and does not encapsulate the value of new activities such as delivering price-free information and entertainment on social media. In 2017 Diane Coyle explained that GDP excludes much unpaid work, writing that \"many people contribute free digital work such as writing open-source software that can substitute for marketed equivalents, and it clearly has great economic value despite a price of zero\", which constitutes a common criticism \"of the reliance on GDP as the measure of economic success\" especially after the emergence of the digital economy. Similarly GDP does not value or distinguish for environmental protection. A 2020 study found that \"poor regions' GDP grows faster by attracting more polluting production after connection to China's expressway system. GDP may not be a tool capable of recognizing how much natural capital agents of the economy are building or protecting."]}, {"page": "Chris Patten", "response": ["Patten submitted his letter of resignation as BBC Trust Chairman to the Secretary of State on 6 May 2014; citing health reasons following his heart bypass surgery on 28 April.
