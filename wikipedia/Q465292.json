Her programmes, such as Sister Wendy's Odyssey and Sister Wendy's Grand Tour, often drew a 25 percent share of the British viewing audience. In 1997, Sister Wendy made her US debut on public television and that same year The New York Times described her as \"a sometime hermit who is fast on her way to becoming the most unlikely and famous art critic in the history of television.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dwight D. Eisenhower", "response": ["Oil painting was one of Eisenhower's hobbies. He began painting while at Columbia University, after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie's portrait. In order to relax, Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life. The images were mostly landscapes, but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie, their grandchildren, General Montgomery, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln. Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower's work, \"simple and earnest, rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president\".

Appearing in her caravan, Sister Wendy introduces herself and the artists she loves (A Passion For Poussin). Sister Anna-Maria, a novice, arrives with the post, including a letter from Daniel, a TV producer, offering Sister Wendy help with a dilemma (Don\u2019t Hide Your Light). Sister Wendy reveals that she has been asked by the BBC to present a TV series, but asks Sister Anna-Maria to keep the project a secret from their reverend mother. In Oxford, Daniel leaves his office in charge of his new work experience girl Pammy, while back in Norfolk, Sister Wendy and Sister Anna-Maria go to chapel (Black And White) where Mother Ruth concedes that the series could benefit all the sisters and allows the plans to go ahead on the condition that Sister Wendy takes care of her failing health. The next day, perplexed by the intricacies of art history, Pammy and Sister Anna-Maria ask Daniel and Sister Wendy to explain (Art Is Meant For Everyone). Daniel receives word that the filming can go ahead and Sister Wendy starts her odyssey around Britain by bringing a biblical tale to life (Salome and St. John). Despite the excitement of making the series, she returns to her life of seclusion, receiving a rare visit from her elderly and ailing cousin. The pair reminisce on their childhood, (Closer Than Sisters), before Daniel invites Sister Wendy to make another series, this time touring around Europe. In Florence, Sister Wendy comes face to face with a renaissance icon (Botticelli\u2019s Birth Of Venus). Daniel treats her to a trip to Paris to celebrate the end of her tour.

Rembrandt made two etchings on the same subject but with differing compositions, one in approximately 1632 and another in 1642 (see gallery below). The 1632 etching shows a different point of view while the 1642 etching shows different figures in the cave. The 1642 etching also depicts Christ as more of a healer, rather than the enchanter of this work. (Sister Wendy Beckett opines that Jesus is portrayed in this work as a weary magician rather than a triumphant savior.) The subject of this painting may draw on an undated Jan Lievens etching of the same name.  Lievens and Rembrandt were friends and probably worked together.Wolfgang Stechow, \u201cRembrandt's representations of the Raising of Lazarus,\u201d Bulletin of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 19, no. 2 (1973)  The composition of the painting may derive from a drawing by Rembrandt from the same time as the Burial of Christ.  Rembrandt would most closely imitate Raising of Lazarus with his 1635/1639 painting The Resurrection.  The placement of the figures is similar and a study of drawings indicates that the latter was developed from the former."]}]}}
