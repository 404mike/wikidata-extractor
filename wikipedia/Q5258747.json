Following questioning of his tactics by a shareholder, an incensed Dick Graham tendered his resignation as manager.

Dennis Mochan was appointed caretaker manager until a permanent replacement could be found. He took charge of five games, but was unable to improve Colchester's fortunes, with two draws and three defeats in his five games at the helm. An unknown Jim Smith, then-manager of Northern Premier League side Boston United who had just led the team to the title, was appointed Graham's replacement. With Colchester bottom of the Football League after 13 matches with six points, Smith's influence gave United an initial boost, earning the Manager of the Month award for lifting the club off the bottom of the table."]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["An eleven-game unbeaten home run gave Colchester a chance for a promotion push, but an expanding injury list held back the U's progress.
