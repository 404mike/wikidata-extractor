The show evolved into what became a weekend-long installation art show in which artists competed to create shocking murals on the gallery walls. Hughes-Freeland filmed the installation, which featured artists including Marilyn Minter, Luis Frangella, James Romberger, Marguerite Van Cook and Wojnarowicz. The management of the gallery, whose interior decoration included polished floors and stained glass windows, supplied the artists with beer and overnight accommodations, but was apparently unaware of the installation's transgressive nature. Some of the artists were allegedly using LSD and applying garish colours and shocking images straight onto the gallery walls. The separate scenes were joined together by profanities applied over the results and decorative additions by Frangella. Gallery management was later said to have been pleased to see the artists go. In 1992 Hughes-Freeland worked in collaboration with Annabelle Davies to create a film called \"Dirty\" based on Georges Bataille's erotic novella Blue of Noon, whose plot touches upon controversial topics like incest and necrophilia.Underground Film Timeline: 1990\u20131999, undergroundfilmjournal, retrieved 27 August 2014 Primarily a filmmaker and writer, Hughes-Freeland has occasionally worked as an actor, appearing in the 1993 film \"Red Spirit Lake,\" whose opening scene depicts sexual imagery and graphic horror, a scene in which Hughes-Freeland does not appear. The director of the movie, Charles Pinion, cast a number of people associated with the Cinema of Transgression movement like Richard Kern and Hughes-Freeland.Charles Pinion Interview: Part Four: Red Spirit Lake, Mike Everleth, undergroundfilmjournal.com, 2014, retrieved 27 August 2014 In the following year, she made Nymphomania, a film whose mythology-inspired plot depicts a wood nymph disrobing whilst a voyeuristic satyr pleasures himself, then forces himself upon the nymph, impaling her upon his barbed phallus. According to Variant.org, \"It is all carried off with an understandably ironic humour. The film is an interesting development, focusing more on mythology than the contemporary. The return to unreconstructed Romanticism has been influential \u2013 Nymphomania is a precursor to the use of such imagery by art world favourite Matthew Barney.\" Hughes-Freeland has worked collaboratively with musicians like John Zorn and J. G. Thirlwell on live multiple projections. One project with Zorn and Troyano, \u201cPlayboy Voodoo,\u201d was performed at the Whitney Museum of American Art as part of the 1996 \u201cNo Wave Cinema\u201d exhibition. The following year, Hughes-Freeland presented an expanded cinema performance with Troyano for Zorn's composition \u201cElegy\u201d as part of Zorn's Tzadik record label European tour. She and Troyano presented an expanded cinema performance with Zorn's \u201cGodard\u201d for Roulette TV in 2002."]}]}}
