The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex.
