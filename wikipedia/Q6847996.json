Over the next six years he scored 58 times in 121 league games for Wrexham before switching to local rivals Chester for \u00a35,000 in December 1963. The following season saw Chester score 141 in Fourth Division, FA Cup and Football League Cup matches, with Metcalf netting 37 of them. His fellow forwards Jimmy Humes, Elfed Morris, Hugh Ryden and Gary Talbot also all scored at least 20 goals during the campaign.Between October 1964 and September 1967, Metcalf started a club record 127 consecutive league games. The record remained intact until March 2009, when it was broken by goalkeeper John Danby. Metcalf remained with Chester until the 1968\u201369 season, playing his final Football League game in a 2\u20130 defeat to Workington on 30 November 1968.Over the following years, Metcalf had spells playing for Altrincham, Bangor City and Rhyl and then became player-manager at Connah's Quay Nomads and Witton Albion.
