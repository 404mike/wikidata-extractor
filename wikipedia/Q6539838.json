Antrim manager Dinny Cahill made some strong comments in the media prior to the game in which he criticised Cork players Brian Corcoran, Niall McCarthy, Tom Kenny and Jerry O'Connor. Right from the throw-in the Cork tempo was furious. Corcoran goaled twice for Cork to give them a commanding 2-13 to 0-3 interval lead.
