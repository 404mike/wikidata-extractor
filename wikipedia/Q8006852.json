He is best known as the co-founder of Clarke Chapman in Gateshead, once one of the largest employers on Tyneside.\nEducated locally, Clarke undertook his apprenticeship with Longbridge's Iron Works in Bedlington and at Armstrong, Mitchell & Co. in Newcastle upon Tyne.\nIn 1864, he set up a small engineering business on the South Shore in the same area as Hawks and Abbots iron foundries.
