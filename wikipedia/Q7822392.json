He and Bramah shared many interests. In the mid-1970s, they were introduced by their friend Barbara Smith to her brother Mark E. Smith and his friend Una Baines. Smith, Baines, Bramah and Friel shared interests in music, and formed their first band, the Fall. Friel remained until December 1977, then he left.\nAfter the Fall, Friel formed a project called Contact and a band called the Passage. In late 1978, he and his former Fall bandmate Karl Burns joined the Teardrops, a group which included Buzzcocks bassist Steve Garvey. They released the Leave Me No Choice EP, and in 1980, the Final Vinyl album, before breaking up.\nIn subsequent years Friel played with R&B bands. Later he was member of the Woodbank Streetband.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Fall (band)", "response": ["The Fall was formed in Prestwich, Greater Manchester, in 1976 by Mark E. Smith, Martin Bramah, Una Baines and Tony Friel. The four friends would meet to read their writings to each other and take drugs. Their musical influences included Can (which the band would later pay tribute to on the track \"I Am Damo Suzuki\"), the Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart and garage rock bands like the Monks and The Stooges. The members were devoted readers, with Smith citing H. P. Lovecraft, Raymond Chandler and Malcolm Lowry among his favourite writers. After seeing Sex Pistols play their second gig at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in July 1976, they decided to start a group. Smith wanted to name the group \"The Outsiders\", but Friel came up with the name \"The Fall\" after a 1956 novel by Albert Camus. Smith became the singer, Bramah the guitarist, Friel played bass guitar and Baines bashed biscuit tins instead of drums; unable to afford to buy a drum kit, she then switched to keyboards. Their music was intentionally raw and repetitive. The song \"Repetition\", declaring that \"we've repetition in the music, and we're never going to lose it\", served as a manifesto for the Fall's musical philosophy."]}, {"page": "Birkenhead", "response": ["There are several musicians linked to the area. Freddie Marks from Rod, Jane and Freddy was born in Birkenhead, as was John Gorman of The Scaffold. Indie band Half Man Half Biscuit hail from Birkenhead, as did boogie-rock band Engine, Paul Heaton, lead singer of the Housemartins and the Beautiful South, singer/songwriter Charlie Landsborough and Desmond Briscoe co-founder and original manager of the pioneering BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Elvis Costello moved to Birkenhead in 1971 with his mother, who was from Liverpool, although Elvis Costello's father was himself from Birkenhead. Tony Friel (bassist from the Fall and the Passage), synthpop musician David Hughes (of Dalek I Love You, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Godot) and Malcolm Holmes (drummer with pop group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark) were born there. David Balfe (music manager, and member of Dalek I Love You, Big in Japan, the Teardrop Explodes) attended primary and secondary school there.

Their early line-up was formed from early members of the punk rock movement. However their music underwent numerous stylistic changes, often concurrently with changes in the group's lineup. The Fall's 40-year career can be broken into five broad periods, based on the band's membership. These include their early late 1970s line-up, the classic Fall period of Hanley and dual drummers, the Brix years of 1984-89, their early 1990s revival, and everything after the on-stage fight in New York, after which Hanley quit and Smith was arrested (see below)."]}, {"page": "Live at the Witch Trials", "response": ["Some of the songs date from earlier incarnations of the group and feature writing credits from former members Tony Friel and Una Baines.

Witts produced the band's recordings and sang on most of their releases, the occasional lead vocal being taken by Tony Friel or Andy Wilson. Although they never truly broke into the mainstream, their most successful song was 'XOYO' which came 41st in John Peel's Festive Fifty for 1982, which was the top 50 songs of the year as voted by the listeners. The song was an experiment to see whether John Cage's method of aleatoric composition could be successfully applied to popular music composition.

Although the sound quality is poor and live documents of the Fall are plentiful, this album is of particular note as it is the earliest available recording of the group performing, apart from two tracks on the Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus compilation. It dates from December 1977, about six weeks after the group had recorded their debut single \"Bingo-Master's Break-Out!\" (which was not released until August 1978). It is the only release on which the early song \"Hey! Fascist\" may be heard, though it was reworked as \"Hey! Student\" and released on Middle Class Revolt 17 years later. Live 1977 also contains very early versions of the 1984 single and \"Oh! Brother\" and the song \"Cop It\", later found on The Wonderful and Frightening World Of... but retitled \"Copped It\". The group\u2019s reworking of \"Louie Louie\", with John the Postman, is featured only on this recording. This was Tony Friel\u2019s last performance with the band.
