This success led Lowery and Griffiths to relocate to London, although Hammond and Archibald didn't follow them and were replaced by Nick Ward on guitar, and by Rab Fae Beith, former drummer with Patrik Fitzgerald (who The Wall had toured with) and The Pack. After meeting Paul Cook and Steve Jones, the two former Sex Pistols decided they wanted to work with the band, and produced the next single, \"Kiss the Mirror\" / \"Exchange\", The Wall becoming the first punk band to be produced by an ex Pistol. Rab became the band's manager, and when their first label Small Wonder ceased operating, he got them a deal with Fresh Records and went into the studio to record the next single \"Ghetto\". Although originally recorded with Lowery on vocals, it would be re-recorded with new singer Ivan Kelly (formerly of Ruefrex). Lowery had decided that Ward should be replaced, but the rest of the band disagreed and instead decided that Lowery should go. Lowery went on to form Ski Patrol (with Archibald) and The Folk Devils, as well as recording solo work. He died in 2001. Former Straps guitarist Andy Forbes was also added to the line-up when Ward decided to leave the band. The debut album, Personal Troubles and Public Issues was released in late 1980. After an unprovoked drunken attack by Kelly on an elderly man while the band were walking through London, the singer was immediately sacked from the band, with Griffiths taking over on vocals. The band were given a support slot on the Stiff Little Fingers Go For It national tour, which was a great success and recorded the Remembrance EP to coincide with the dates, with a stand-in bassist playing in the live shows.Larkin, Colin (1992) The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music, Guinness Publishing, p. 306,  On returning from the tour, Claire Bidwell of The Passions joined on bass guitar, leaving Griffiths free to concentrate on vocals. The band's second album, Dirges and Anthems was released in April 1982, the band now signed to Polydor Records. Polydor insisted that \"Epitaph\" be released as a single, but it was outsold by the Hobby for a Day EP released on Fresh Records shortly before, and the band were dropped by Polydor. The Wall were reduced to a duo of Beith and Griffiths, who soldiered on for one last effort, the Day Tripper EP in late 1982, before the group split up for good."]}, {"page": "Robert Blamire", "response": ["He also worked with Patrik Fitzgerald, and produced Scottish post-punk band The Scars' only album, Author!

[encountering] Time on Their Hands, 1998, by the group Rooney, the listener might be reminded of any and all of the following: Patrik Fitzgerald's dour requiem to hope, Tonight, the later songs of Ivor Cutler, the Intense Emotion Society of middle period Dexy's Midnight Runners, the industrial melancholy of Throbbing Gristle's Twenty Jazz Funk Greats and the ambiguous intellectualism of The Television Personalities, notably their re-issue, ...And Don't the Kids Just Love It.'
