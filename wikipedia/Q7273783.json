Critics, such as Evangelical pastor Michael Catt, have argued that prosperity theology has little in common with traditional Christian theology. Prominent evangelical leaders, such as Rick Warren, Ben Witherington III, and Jerry Falwell, have harshly criticized the movement, sometimes denouncing it as heretical. Warren proposes that prosperity theology promotes the idolatry of money, and others argue that Jesus' teachings indicate a disdain for material wealth. In Mark: Jesus, Servant and Savior, R. Kent Hughes notes that some 1st-century rabbis portrayed material blessings as a sign of God's favor. He cites Jesus' statement in Mark 10:25 that \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God\" (KJV) as evidence to oppose such thinking."]}, {"page": "Albert Mohler", "response": ["*The Coming Evangelical Crisis: Current Challenges to the Authority of Scripture and the Gospel by R.
