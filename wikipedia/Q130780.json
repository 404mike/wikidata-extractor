However, E. C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak were the first proponents of the successful V-A (vector minus axial vector, or left-handed) theory for weak interactions in 1957. It was essentially the same theory as that proposed by Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann in their \"mathematical physics\" paper on the structure of the weak interaction. Actually, Gell-Mann had been let in on the Sudarshan/Marshak work on Sudarshan's initiative, but no acknowledgment appeared in the later paper, except for an informal allusion. The reason given was that the originators' work had not been published in a formal or 'reputable enough' science journal at the time. The theory is popularly known in the west as the Feynman-Gell-Mann theory.Sudarshan: Seven Science Quests. ph.utexas.edu. The V-A theory for weak interactions was, in effect, a new Law of Nature. It was conceived in the face of a series of apparently contradictory experimental results, including several from Chien-Shiung Wu. It was also aided along by a sprinkling of other evidence, like the muon. Discovered in 1936, the muon had a curious and colorful history\"The E821 Muon (g-2) Home Page\". all to itself and would itself lead on to a new revolution in the 21st century.\"New g-2 Measurement Deviates Further From Standard Model\".
