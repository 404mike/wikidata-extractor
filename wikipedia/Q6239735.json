He was a member of the King's Men, the most prominent playing company of its era, best known as the company of William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage.Honyman belonged to the generation that followed Shakespeare and Burbage. He was christened on 7 February 1613, in the parish of St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate. An apprentice of John Shank, he started his career as a boy player filling female roles; in his teens he was playing leading female parts, Domitilla in The Roman Actor (1626) and Sophia in The Picture  (1629), both plays by Philip Massinger, and Clarinda in Lodowick Carlell's The Deserving Favourite (also 1629).\nSome boy actors of Honyman's era made successful transitions from filling lead female roles as boys to lead male roles as young men; Stephen Hammerton and Richard Sharpe are two examples of this successful transition.  John Honyman illustrates the opposite phenomenon, in that he graduated to only rather minor roles as a young adult. He played the servingman Sly in John Clavell's The Soddered Citizen (1630), and the First Merchant in Massinger's Believe as You List (1631). In the 1632 King's Men's revival of John Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase, he filled the minor part of \"Young Man disguised as a Factor.\"\nHonyman was made a Groom of the Chamber on 15 April 1633, along with John Thompson. His potential development in his craft was cut short by his early death. He was buried on 13 April 1636. His last will and testament, drawn up six days earlier on 7 April (Robert Benfield was one of the witnesses), leaves bequests to his mother, father, and brother, his fellow actors, and the poor of his parish, St. Giles without Cripplegate. Thomas Jordan published an elegy on Honyman in his Love's Dialact (1646).\nHonyman also appears to have been among the minority of actors who wrote one or more plays. Sir Aston Cockayne left a 10-line poem \"To Mr. John Hunnieman\" that extols his \"Successful pen and fortunate fantasy\" and even compares Honyman to Shakespeare. Yet nothing is known of Honyman's dramas, not even their titles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "English Renaissance theatre", "response": ["*John Honyman"]}, {"page": "King's Men (playing company)", "response": ["Shank would be the company's primary clown in the years to come; his specialties were dancing and knockabout physical comedy. He was a veteran of several troupes over the previous decades, going back perhaps to Pembroke's Men and Queen Elizabeth's Men in the reign of Elizabeth; he had been with the Admiral's/Prince Henry's/Palsgrave's company in the 1610\u201313 period. Shank may have taken Robert Armin's place in the King's Men after Armin's death in 1615. Shank also trained apprentices for the company \u2013 Thomas Holcombe, John Thompson, Thomas Pollard, and John Honyman. Robert Gough had been associated with the actors of the company perhaps as far back as 1591, when he may have been a boy player in The Seven Deadly Sins; he received a legacy in the 1603 will of Thomas Pope, and he witnessed the 1605 will of Augustine Phillips, whose sister he most likely married. Gough was never a prominent actor, and little is known about the roles he played.", "When the King's Men premiered Massinger's The Roman Actor late in 1626, the cast included a new boy player, John Honyman, aged 13.

An example: John Honyman started playing female roles for the King's Men at age\u00a013, in 1626, in Philip Massinger's The Roman Actor. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of Lodowick Carlell's The Deserving Favourite and Massinger's The Picture (both in 1629). Yet in 1630, at age\u00a017, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, John Thompson and Richard Sharpe, appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been \"young men\" rather than \"boys.\" Theophilus Bird played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles."]}, {"page": "Believe as You List", "response": ["|John Honyman"]}, {"page": "The Roman Actor", "response": ["| John Honyman", "In addition, James Horn and George Vernon played two lictors.

The quarto bears a dedication from Ford to four friends at Gray's Inn, one of whom is a cousin, also named John Ford. This second John Ford contributed commendatory verse to a couple of the dramatist's plays, including The Lover's Melancholy. The first edition also supplies an unusually full cast list, specifying the 17 King's Men's actors who took part in the original production.They are listed in this order: John Lowin, Joseph Taylor, Robert Benfield, John Shank, Eliard Swanston, Anthony Smith, Richard Sharpe, Thomas Pollard, William Penn, Curtis Greville, George Vernon, Richard Baxter, John Thompson, John Honyman, James Horn, William Trigg, and Alexander Gough.

Shank trained Thomas Pollard, Thomas Holcomb, John Honyman, Nicholas Burt, and John Thompson, who were significant members of the company in the late Jacobean and Caroline eras. (Later, Shank would claim that he spent \u00a340 on Thompson, and \u00a3200 on his apprentices overall.) Shank is known to have played at least one female role himself in these years, the minor part of the servant Petella in the company's 1632 revival of Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase.
