She was convicted in 1917, along with her daughter, Winnie, and son-in-law, Alfred Mason, of conspiracy to murder the Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. Some of the evidence given in the case against them appears to have been fabricated on behalf of \"a government eager to disgrace the anti-war movement\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
