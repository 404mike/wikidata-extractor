Appearing initially in the unbroadcast pilot (subsequently available on DVD), the round has varied little in content and style since, although the questions became slightly more obtuse. From the start the round consisted of several deliberately misleading questions which appear to have obvious answers that are actually inaccurate (for example, aircraft black boxes are in fact orange, for visibility.) The pilot also introduced the concept of penalising answers that were overly predictable, especially obvious jokes: one such question in the pilot was, \"What is the sixth most popular name for a baby boy in Germany?\" The answer to the question is, in fact, \"Tim\". However, QI's regular panellist Alan Davies answered with the jokey suggestion \"Adolph\", allowing host Stephen Fry to produce a prepared piece of card reading \"Adolph,\" whereupon the obvious-but-inaccurate answer was revealed to carry a penalty score of \u221210 points.
