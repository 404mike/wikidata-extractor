Originally a constituent of Thorncroft Manor, it was an area of arable land, known as 'Gibbons Farm', named after a prominent local family. In the late 1780s, Henry Boulton, the then leaseholder of Thorncroft Manor and the owner of the Pachesham estate, built 'Givons Grove House', which was occupied for a short time by Sir William Altum. The house remained in the ownership of the Boulton family until 1859 and in 1865, it was bought by Thomas Grissell, the owner of Norbury Park.

Construction of the tower began on 28 September 1845. The building contractors were Thomas Grissell and Morton Peto. An inscribed trowel now in the Parliamentary Archives records that Emily, sister of Peto's daughter-in-law, was given the honour of laying the first stone.McKay, p. 46. It was Pugin's last design before his descent into mental illness and death in 1852, and Pugin himself wrote, at the time of Barry's last visit to him to collect the drawings: \"I never worked so hard in my life for Mr Barry for tomorrow I render all my designs for finishing his bell tower and it is beautiful\".Hill, p. 482."]}, {"page": "Edward Betts", "response": ["Separately, the partnership between the major civil engineering contractors Samuel Morton Peto and Thomas Grissell was dissolved in 1846, and so Betts worked with Peto on parts of the Great Northern Railway."]}, {"page": "Wharncliffe Viaduct", "response": ["The contractor was the partnership of Thomas Grissell and Samuel Morton Peto.

Similarly, the  Mickleham Tunnel was bored through the chalk with no vertical ventilation shafts. When the line opened in 1867, Grissell secured the right to stop on request any train passing through the railway station at Westhumble, a concession that was abolished by the Transport Act 1962.
