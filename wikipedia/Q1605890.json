Lionised by the press for his outlandish expeditious adventures across Central Asia, Burnaby at 6\u00a0ft 4 ins tall with broad shoulders was a giant amongst men, symbolic of a Victorian celebrity, feted in London society.White-Spunner, p.400-408"]}, {"page": "List of eponyms (L\u2013Z)", "response": ["* William Archibald Spooner, British teacher \u2013 spoonerism."]}, {"page": "Absent-minded professor", "response": ["The archetype is very old: the ancient Greek biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius wrote that the philosopher Thales walked at night with his eyes focused on the heavens and, as a result, fell down a well.Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, \"Thales\" Thomas Aquinas, Isaac Newton,, p.ix Adam Smith, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re, Jacques Hadamard, Sewall Wright, Nikola Tesla, Norbert Wiener, Archimedes, Pierre Curie, p.76 and Albert Einstein were all scholars considered to be absent-minded \u2013 their attention absorbed by their academic studies.

They occur more often when speakers are nervous, tired, anxious or intoxicated. During live broadcasts on TV or on the radio, for example, nonprofessional speakers and even hosts often make speech errors because they are under stress. Some speakers seem to be more prone to speech errors than others. For example, there is a certain connection between stuttering and speech errors. Charles F. Hockett explains that \"whenever a speaker feels some anxiety about possible lapse, he will be led to focus attention more than normally on what he has just said and on what he is just about to say. These are ideal breeding grounds for stuttering.\" Another example of a \"chronic sufferer\" is Reverend William Archibald Spooner, whose peculiar speech may be caused by a cerebral dysfunction, but there is much evidence that he invented his famous speech errors (spoonerisms).", "|  A spoonerism is a kind of metathesis.
