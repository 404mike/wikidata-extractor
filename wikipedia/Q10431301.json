Although he made a few appearances in the lower divisions of the Football League for Brentford and Rushden & Diamonds, the majority of his playing career was spent in non-league football in the south-east of England. He was capped seven times for the National Game XI, the team that represents England at semi-professional level.\nAfter retirement as a player, Wormull joined the coaching staff of Isthmian League club Lewes, where he was first-team manager from January 2012 to the end of the 2012\u201313 season. He spent a few months as manager of Crawley Down Gatwick before returning to Three Bridges first as academy head, then as first-team coach.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crawley Town F.C.", "response": ["The 2005\u201306 season didn't start well for Crawley as the club found themselves third from bottom and out of the FA Cup after a shock defeat to Braintree Town. Francis Vines was subsequently sacked and replaced by former Chelsea FC manager and player John Hollins and his assistant Alan Lewer. Things got worse for Crawley and as attendances dropped, and so too did the club's income; the club's owners were forced to slash the players' and staff wages by 50% due to lack of funds. Several key players left the club, including captain Ian Simpemba, Simon Wormull and record signing Daryl Clare; it looked certain that relegation was on the cards. However five straight wins through March and April saw the club climb the table to 17th place and beat the drop by 10 points. The club was docked three points at the end of the season for breaching the annual playing budget but this had no effect on the final standings and Crawley's league status was safe. However, they later went into administration, with insolvency specialists Begbies Traynor placed in control of the club."]}, {"page": "Jamie Cade", "response": ["He had brief spells with Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Darlington before joining Crawley Town under Francis Vines. Having scored four league and cup goals under Vines and caretaker Simon Wormull, Cade went on loan to Lewes in the Conference South after Vines was sacked and former Chelsea legend John Hollins took charge. The spell at Lewes proved successful scoring seven goals in his time there taking his season tally to 11. Cade went on to play 96 games for Lewes scoring 21 goals in his time. A conference South league winners medal was his first silverware and the best finish of the club's history."]}, {"page": "Jean-Michel Sigere", "response": ["In March 2000, Sigere came to England to further his career. He joined Rushden & Diamonds of the Football Conference on loan until the end of the 1999\u20132000 season; for the second time that season he contributed to his club reaching to runners-up spot in their league. The following season, he played his part in Rushden winning the Conference championship, and thereby promotion to the Football League. He played seven games for Rushden in Division Three, and scored the goal which gave them their first home win in the Football League, but shortly afterwards manager Brian Talbot sold Sigere and Simon Wormull to Conference club Stevenage Borough for \"a five-figure sum\".", "Following the dismissal of manager Steve King, many Lewes players left the club. Though the club wanted them to stay, Sigere and teammate Simon Wormull joined local rivals Eastbourne Borough. The pair made their debuts in the opening-day defeat to former club Rushden & Diamonds, making Eastbourne the fifth club (following Rushden, Stevenage, Hornchurch and Lewes) where the two played alongside each other. Injuries restricted Sigere's Eastbourne career: by the beginning of October he had played only five matches and been placed on the transfer list. He rejoined Horsham on loan for three months, to regain form and fitness with a view to a permanent deal. Yet again he scored on debut, this time converting a penalty to put Horsham through to the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup. He scored and provided an assist in the next round against former club Stevenage Borough but, with a place in the First Round Proper in sight, Horsham conceded a late equaliser and went on to lose heavily in the replay. Although both player and manager hoped to extend his stay at the club, it was not financially viable, and Sigere returned to Eastbourne having scored nine goals in all competitions for Horsham."]}, {"page": "Garry Wilson (footballer)", "response": ["Wilson was appointed manager of Eastbourne Borough's local rivals Lewes in late May 2013, replacing Simon Wormull. On being appointed Wilson said, \"I am thrilled to be joining such a progressive club. It's going to be an exciting challenge and one we are all looking forward to. I've been mightily impressed with all I've seen and heard at the Dripping Pan and I cannot wait to get started.\" On 17 February 2015 Wilson, his assistant manager Danny Bloor and first team coach Dean Lightwood departed Lewes by mutual consent."]}]}}
