Satie's first biographers Pierre-Daniel Templier (1932) and Rollo H.

In the 1980s Robert Orledge discovered the \"Mme Fellowes\" manuscript among the composer's notebooks at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France and confirmed it was the missing score for La statue. He first published it in his book Satie the Composer (1990) and edited a performing edition published by Salabert in 1997.

It was a spoof of the flamboyant P\u00e9ladan, whose Rose + Croix creed (\"the transformation of society through art\") and habit of \"excommunicating\" his critics in bombastic letters to newspapers Satie gleefully adopted.Steven Moore Whiting, \"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\", Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 162-163, 170-171. He carried the charade into his daily existence, dressing in monkish robes and referring to his tiny room at 6 Rue Cortot as his abbatiale (abbey). \"[Satie] liked to affect the unctuous manners of a priest,\" his friend Francis Jourdain recalled. \"They suited him so well, he played his part so accurately - being careful not to overdo things - that the question arose as to whether a slightly false air was not innate in him.\"Quoted in Robert Orledge, \"Satie Remembered\", Faber and Faber Ltd., 1995, p. 39.", "Against this background, Satie's motives for writing the Messe des pauvres - the sole composition linked to his church - are obscure.

At the midpoint of their turbulent six-month affair in March 1893, Satie had composed his Danses gothiques as a \"Novena for the great calm and profound tranquility of my Soul\"; similarly, the first mass movement he completed (in late 1893) was the Pri\u00e8re pour le salut de mon \u00e2me (\"Prayer for the salvation of my soul\").Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 279. It is unknown how the mass assumed its final title Messe des pauvres. The texts Satie chose make no reference to the poor at large, giving further weight to speculations that, impoverished as he was, he essentially wrote the mass for his own solace.", "In 1895, a substantial cash gift from a friend enabled Satie to publish a series of tracts in which, under the guise of his church, he criticised those of whom he disapproved. Portions of the Messe des pauvres appeared in two of them: an extract from the Commune qui mundi nefas in a pamphlet of the same name (January 1895), and the complete Dixit Domine - calligraphed in faux Gregorian notation by Satie - in the brochure Intende votis supplicum (March 1895).Facsimiles of both scores appear in Nigel Wilkins (ed.), \"The Writings of Erik Satie\", Eulenburg Books, London, 1980, pp. 38-42. The only contemporary account of the mass is an article by the composer's brother, Conrad Satie, published in the June 1895 issue of Le coeur. He described it as a work in progress, humbly scored for organ and a choir of children's and men's voices. \"This mass is music for the divine sacrifice, and there will be no part for the orchestras which, I'm sorry to say, find their way into most masses,\" he wrote.Conrad Satie, \"Erik Satie\", Le coeur, June 1895, pp. 2-3. Quoted in Robert Orledge, \"Satie Remembered\", Faber and Faber, London, 1995, pp. 49-50. He also made an intriguing statement about its structure: \"Between the Kyrie and the Gloria a prayer is inserted called Pri\u00e8re des orgues.\" The Gloria movement was not found in Satie's posthumous papers and is considered lost.", "The published score presents the mass in seven movements:According to Robert Orledge, Satie listed the opening organ solo (Prelude) as a separate movement, even though it serves to introduce the material of the Kyrie which follows without a break. With the missing Gloria the mass would have had nine movements. See Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 279.", "Examining the score in the 1980s, Robert Orledge found \"sprawling uncertainties\" in its \"assortment of movements\" and believed the mass was left unfinished.Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 164 and p. 352, note 16.

This led Swedish pianist-musicologist Olof H\u00f6jer, who recorded Satie's complete keyboard works in the 1990s, to suggest a theory about the extramusical structure of the Danses gothiques: \"Judging by the appearance of the manuscript, it seems that his main interest was the optical impression that the arrangement of the different parts would make on the score along with the headings. Perhaps this is an early example - maybe even the first - of a musical mise en page, an artistically intended integration of music, notation and text, quite probably inspired by Satie's contact with contemporary poets.\"Olof H\u00f6jer, notes to \"Erik Satie\", pp. 18-20.", "The title Concerning Saint Bernard and Saint Lucy (No. 4) touches on Satie's lifelong fascination with eyes and their recurrence as a literary motif in his work.See Robert Orledge, notes to Soundkiosk editions of Satie's music, 2011, p. 19. http://www.soundkiosk.com/pdffiles/Sample%20book%20web%20Vol%203.pdf At first glance the 12th century French abbot who preached the Second Crusade and the 3rd century Sicilian virgin martyr would seem a strange pairing. But Saint Lucy is a patron of the blind, and eyes figure in the iconography of both. Saint Lucy was often depicted bearing her eyes on a platter, having (according to one tradition) gouged them out herself to ward off a persistent suitor.In his \"Christian ballet\" Uspud (1892) Satie presented a Saint Micanar (?) also carrying his eyes on a platter. And in a variant of Saint Bernard's \"Lactation Miracle\" he was healed of an ailment that threatened his sight by praying to an image of the Nursing Madonna. The icon came to life and squirted her breast milk into his eyes.Patrick J.

Its pride of place at the top of the score is instead taken by the playing direction tr\u00e8s lent (\"very slow\"), and the greeting \"Bonjour Biqui, Bonjour!\" constitutes the entire \"lyrics.\"", "Robert Orledge found stylistic links between the song and two other Satie compositions which place all three within the context of the Satie-Valadon affair. Bonjour Biqui and the piano piece Vexations are constructed entirely from \"ambiguous diminished chords\" first found in the Danses gothiques, which Satie completed on March 23, 1893 in an attempt to regain his composure in the midst of his stormy romance;Ornella Volta, \"Satie Seen Through His Letters\", Marion Boyars Publishers, New York, 1989, p. 48. and the Vexations begins with the same chord with which Bonjour Biqui ends, almost as if one was meant to be an extension of the other.

By April 1887 he was back at his family's home in Paris on a two-month medical leave.Robert Orledge, \"Satie Remembered\", Faber and Faber Limited, 1995, p. xxiii.", "Biographer Mary E. Davis wrote that \"the Sarabandes introduce compositional approaches that would prove important not only in Satie's later work but also in the broader history of French music...they presented a new conception of large-scale form, in which groups of three very similar pieces, deliberately interlinked by means of motivic cells, harmonic events and recurring interval patterns, combine to constitute a unified work.\"Mary E.

In place of continuous development we are given mosaic-like progressions of unresolved dissonances, shifting between movement and stasis, which imbue the stately dignity of the sarabande with a suspended, timeless quality.Joseph Smith, notes to \"Erik Satie's First Sarabande\", 2012, at ", "The possible influence of Chabrier on Satie's advanced harmonic language of the 1880s has long been noted, by Maurice Ravel in the 1920sMaurice Ravel, \"Contemporary Music,\" Rice Institute Pamphlet, Rice University Studies, 15, no. 2 (1928).

Yet there are signs Satie was already feeling his way towards a harmonic \"no-man's land\" in the unconventional ninths and even thirteenths that appear in his 3 m\u00e9lodies (to poems by Latour) of 1886,Robert Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 34.Olof H\u00f6jer's notes to \"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 1\", pp. 15-17, Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. and his tonal approach in the Sarabandes is radically different. Chabrier's dissonances in Le roi malgr\u00e9 lui enrich the musical color but function within a traditional dramatic framework; Satie's dissonances become musical events in themselves. Or as pianist-author Joseph Smith put it, \"For Chabrier, the A.1. Sauce; for Satie, the steak.\"Smith, notes to \"Erik Satie's First Sarabande\". See Note 18.

Maurice Ravel, who first met Satie in 1893, knew of the pieces and spoke highly of them to members of his circle. In 1905 Ravel introduced critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi to Satie, who showed him the manuscript of the Sarabandes.
