The commission reported that industrialization and de-tribalization were the most important problems in Northern Rhodesia, and the tax's abrupt implementation led to the strike. The report disregarded the role of Beni, but acknowledged that the dancers were primarily involved in recreation and welfare activities. It described two systems of authority: \"The choice lies between the establishment of native authority, together with frequent repatriation of natives to their villages; or alternatively, the acceptance of definite de-tribalization and industrialization of the mining under European urban control\". After the enquiry, Hubert Winthrop Young, governor of Northern Rhodesia from 1935 to 1938, established a tribal leaders' advisory council for Africans in the Copperbelt similar to the one at the Roan Antelope mine.

During his visit, George laid the foundation stone of Lusaka's administrative buildings, as well as opening roads named after his father and himself. After the royal visit, Young wrote to the Colonial Office that he was \"optimistic about the future of Lusaka\", and he appointed administrator Eric Dutton to lead the project. There was some resistance from the white population of Livingstone, which feared that the capital would lead to a loss of business. Young refused their demand to compensate them financially, but he sought to placate them by establishing Livingstone as the protectorate's tourism capital, with a new museum and a game reserve. Lusaka formally became the capital in May 1935, with a \"Lusaka week\" celebration scheduled to coincide with celebrations of George V's silver jubilee.
