Two weeks later, he scored his first goal for the club, away to Southampton. Arsenal went to the top of the league table on goal difference in September 1997, after a 4\u20130 win against West Ham United. Overmars, who scored two goals in the match, had now \"run into devastating form\" according to Brian Glanville. His impact however waned in the subsequent months and so did Arsenal's form; a 3\u20131 defeat to Blackburn Rovers on 13 December 1997 meant the club dropped to fifth place. The turn of the year saw improvement to Overmars' game, which coincided with \"the more general rejuvenation of the whole team\". He scored both of Arsenal's goals in their win over Leeds United on 11 January 1998. Overmars up until this point was subject to criticism from commentators and fans. Wenger emphasised that this was his first year in England and there was more to come from him.

The Football Association, particularly Ted Croker, were impressed with Revie's personality and ideas. He was a popular appointment with the press and supporters; noted journalist Brian Glanville wrote that \"Revie was the obvious choice\". Revie attempted to build a relationship with the media, and also invited 81 prospective and established England players to a meeting in Manchester to make everyone feel included, where he announced that he would establish extra pay for international players as well as bonus payments for wins and draws. He held a meeting with Alan Hardaker, chairman of the Football League, but Hardaker had long resented Revie and was very reluctant to accept his proposal to rearrange league fixtures to benefit the England team. He also had difficult relationships with figures within the FA, most notoriously with chairman Sir Harold Thompson, who allegedly attempted to influence Revie's team selections and undermine him publicly. As well as this he found difficulty in his attempts to introduce the Leeds traditions into the England camp, such as carpet bowls and bingo, which were met with resentment and disdain by some England internationals. Colin Todd stated that Revie was ill-suited to the England job, with his strengths lying in the day-to-day contact found only in club management rather than the politics and committee meetings of international management."]}, {"page": "Colin Bell", "response": ["In 1969, Bell distinguished himself in the national team, scoring England's only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over the Netherlands in an \"all-action display\".

Bell gave England an early lead in a game against Brazil, but late goals from Tost\u00e3o and Jairzinho gave Brazil a 2\u20131 victory. Bell also played in a 2\u20131 victory against Uruguay on the tour. He also helped England to win the 1968\u201369 British Home Championship.

When he did sign professional forms Raynor's career took him only on an uninspired jaunt around the Football League.

Between 1932 and 1939 he played for four different League clubs, the last of these (Aldershot) in the truncated season before the start of the War. He signed up as a physical training instructor (PTI) in 1939 in order to train soldiers in the British Army. The Football Association had requested that all professional footballers become PTIs if they were not inclined to see active service. Raynor was posted to Iraq and whilst in the course of working as a training instructor in Baghdad, he helped a fellow teacher club together a group of students into a team which toured the neighbouring states as a representative of Iraq. His work in Iraq came to the notice of the Secretary of the FA Stanley Rous.
