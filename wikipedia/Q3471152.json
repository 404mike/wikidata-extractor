He was also well versed in physics and mathematics, on which he wrote a number of papers and thus was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767; and secretary in 1773, but, in consequence of a difference with the president (Sir Joseph Banks) he withdrew in 1784.Entering Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1751, he became LL.B. in 1758 without graduating in arts. In the following year he succeeded his father in the living of Newington Butts in Surrey.  In 1768 he attended the son and heir of the 3rd Earl of Aylesford to Oxford as private tutor; and, after receiving through the earl and Bishop of London various minor preferments, which by dispensations he combined with his first living, he was installed in 1781 as archdeacon of St Albans.Horsley now entered on his controversy with Joseph Priestley, who denied that the early Christians held the doctrine of the Trinity. In this fierce debate, Horsley's aim was to lessen the influence which Priestley's name gave to his views, by pointing to (what he claimed were) inaccuracies in his scholarship. Horsley was rewarded by Lord Chancellor Thurlow with a prebendal stall at Gloucester; and in 1788 Thurlow procured his promotion to the see of St David's.As a bishop, Horsley was active both in his diocese, and in parliament. The effective support which he afforded the government was acknowledged by his successive translations to Rochester in 1793, and to St Asaph in 1802. With the see of Rochester he held the deanery of Westminster.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Hall (minister)", "response": ["Hall's first published compositions had a political origin. In 1791 he wrote Christianity consistent with the Love of Freedom, a defense of the political conduct of dissenters against the attacks of John Clayton, gave expression to his hopes of political and social improvements as destined to result from the subversion of old ideas and institutions in the French Revolution. In 1793 he expounded his political sentiments in a longer pamphlet, Apology for the Freedom of the Press. He was unhappy with the pamphlet, and refused to permit publication after the third edition. In a new edition of 1821 he omitted the attack on Bishop Samuel Horsley, and stated that his political opinions had undergone no substantial change."]}, {"page": "Robert Raikes", "response": ["There were disputes about the movement in the early years. The schools were derisively called \"Raikes' Ragged School\". Criticisms raised included that it would weaken home-based religious education, that it might be a desecration of the Sabbath, and that Christians should not be employed on the Sabbath. Some leading ecclesiastics\u2014among them Bishop Samuel Horsley\u2014opposed them on the grounds that they might become subservient to purposes of political propagandism. \"Sabbatarian disputes\" in the 1790s led many Sunday schools to cease their teaching of writing. Notwithstanding all this, Adam Smith gave the movement his strongest commendation: \"No plan has promised to effect a change of manners with equal ease and simplicity since the days of the Apostles.\""]}, {"page": "1784 in literature", "response": ["*Samuel Horsley \u2013 Letters from the Archdeacon of St. Albans"]}, {"page": "Timeline of meteorology", "response": ["::- Royal Society begins twice daily observations compiled by Samuel Horsley testing for the influence of winds and of the moon on the barometer readings.J.L.
