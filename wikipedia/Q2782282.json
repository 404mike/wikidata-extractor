It is important to note that \"the predicate 'personal' as applied to God\" does not mean that God is corporeal or anthropomorphic, views which Judaism has always rejected; rather, \"personality\" refers not to physicality, but to \"inner essence, psychical, rational, and moral\". Although most Jews believe that \"God can be experienced\", it is understood that \"God cannot be understood\" because \"God is utterly unlike humankind\" (as shown in God's response to Moses when Moses asked for God's name: \"I Am that I Am\"); all anthropomorphic statements about God \"are understood as linguistic metaphors; otherwise, it would be impossible to talk about God at all\".", "The Hebrew Bible or Tanakh is the Jewish scriptural canon and central source of Jewish law. The word is an acronym formed from the initial Hebrew letters of the three traditional subdivisions of the Tanakh: The Torah (\"Teaching\", also known as the Five Books of Moses or Pentateuch), the Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") and the Ketuvim (\"Writings\").Peter A. Pettit, \"Hebrew Bible\" in A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations (2005). Eds. Edward Kessler and Neil Wenborn. Cambridge University Press. The Tanakh contains 24 books in all; its authoritative version is the Masoretic Text. Traditionally, the text of the Tanakh was said to have been finalized at the Council of Jamnia in 70 CE, although this is uncertain. In Judaism, the term \"Torah\" refers not only to the Five Books of Moses, but also to all of the Jewish scriptures (the whole of Tanakh), and the ethical and moral instructions of the rabbis (the Oral Torah).Christopher Hugh Partridge, Introduction to World Religions (2005). Fortress Press: pp 283-286.", "Judaism rejects the belief in \"original sin\". Both ancient and modern Judaism teaches that every person is responsible for his own actions. However, the existence of some \"innate sinfulness on each human being was discussed\" in both biblical (Genesis 8:21, Psalms 51.5) and post-biblical sources.Edward Kessler, \"Original Sin\" in A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations (eds. Edward Kessler & Neil Wenborn, Cambridge University Press, 2005) pp. 323-324. Some apocrypha and pseudepigraphic sources express pessimism about human nature (\"A grain of evil seed was sown in Adam's heart from the beginning\"), and the Talmud (b. Avodah Zarah 22b) has an unusual passage which Edward Kessler describes as \"the serpent seduced Eve in paradise and impregnated her with spiritual-physical 'dirt' which was inherited through the generations\", but the revelation at Sinai and the reception of the Torah cleansed Israel. Kessler states that \"although it is clear that belief in some form of original sin did exist in Judaism, it did not become mainstream teaching, nor dogmatically fixed\", but remained at the margins of Judaism."]}, {"page": "Centre for Jewish\u2013Christian Relations", "response": ["Founded by Edward Kessler and Martin Forward in 1998, CJCR teaches the University of Cambridge's Master of Studies in the study of Jewish\u2013Christian relations programme and offers a variety of other educational programmes.

They were diverse in terms of age, gender, ethnicity and occupation, and in their religious, philosophical and political outlooks. They began by engaging in a substantial consultation exercise. There were six weekend meetings with visiting speakers, and public hearings were arranged in Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester and London. A booklet was published and widely distributed and more than 200 substantial responses to this were received. There were many visits to, and interviews with, key individuals, projects and organisations."]}]}}
