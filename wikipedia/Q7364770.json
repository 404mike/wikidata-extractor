He was a scion of the Earls of Erne.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Sa\u00ebns \"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \"Saint-Sa\u00ebns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\".Huebner, p. 226 Saint-Sa\u00ebns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \"with a light French touch\".Harding, p. 119"]}, {"page": "Darius Milhaud", "response": ["* Darius Milhaud 1892\u20131974 by Ronald Crichton.

Alongside Dmitri Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev, he has been generally cited as one of the three greatest composers of the Soviet era. As early as 1957 Time magazine called Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Khachaturian \"the three modern giants\" of Soviet music. They are sometimes collectively referred to as the three \"titans\" of Soviet music. \"Whether or not history will support the verdict, Khachaturian in his lifetime ranked as the third most celebrated Soviet composer after Shostakovich and Prokofiev\", wrote the music critic Ronald Crichton in 1978. According to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, \"his works do not enjoy the international reputation that those of\" Shostakovich and Prokofiev do. With the two aforementioned composers and Dmitry Kabalevsky, Khachaturian \"was one of the few Soviet composers to have become known to the wider international public\". According to music historian Harlow Robinson, \"his proletariat origins, non-Russian ethnic origins and Soviet training [made him] a powerful symbol within the Soviet musical establishment of the ideal of a multinational Soviet cultural identity, an identity which the composer enthusiastically embraced and exploited both at home and abroad\". Unlike Prokofiev and Shostakovich, Khachaturian was \"entirely a creation of the Soviet musical and dance establishment\"."]}, {"page": "Crichton", "response": ["* Ronald Crichton, (1913\u20132005), English music critic"]}, {"page": "La vida breve (opera)", "response": ["La vida breve  (Spanish Life is Short or The Brief Life) is an opera in two acts and four scenes by Manuel de Falla to an original Spanish libretto by Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez-Shaw.

Claude Debussy played a major role in influencing Falla to transform it from the number opera it was at its Nice premiere to an opera with a more continuous musical texture and more mature orchestration.
