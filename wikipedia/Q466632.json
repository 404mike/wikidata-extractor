The 19 year old Johan Cruyff scored for Ajax.http://sportnabiblioteka.bg/images/download/Football/4_24.pdf In August 1966 the team from Varna visited England and played three matches. The most memorable was the 1\u20130 win against Nottingham Forest on City Ground. Nottingham fielded a strong side with Peter Grummitt, Bob McKinlay, Alan Hinton, Henry Newton, Joe Baker, Terry Hennessey, Jeff Whitefoot in the starting 11. The match was decided with a long range shot from defender Dimitar Bosnov in the first half.http://www.retro-football.bg/sites/default/files/books/futbol_71.pdf p. 59 Nottingham Forest was to end the 1966-67 season as runners-up in the Football League First Division. The other two matches ended in a 1\u20131 draw against Coventry City after Stefan Yanev had opened the score, and a 1\u20132 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday F.C.. After 16 years in the top flight, Cherno More was relegated in 1976 and won promotion the following season.  A new generation of players was emerging. Defenders Todor Marev and Ivan Ivanov, midfielders Todor Atanasov and Ivan Andreev, forwards Rafi Rafiev and Nikola Spasov left many good memories in the late 70s and the 80s. In the 1981\u201382 season, the team finished 4th and therefore qualified for the Intertoto Cup. Cherno More won twice 2\u20130 at home against Standard Li\u00e8ge and the Danes from Hvidovre IF and drew 1\u20131 against Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Away, they drew 1\u20131 in Denmark and lost 1-3 and 0\u20133 in Li\u00e8ge and Leverkusen respectively. Later in the 80s, Cherno More was relegated twice and played 3 seasons in \"B\" RFG.

Hinton spent four years at Forest between 1963 and 1967 before Clough signed him for \u00a330,000. Forest had seen Hinton as a fairly uninspiring player and a number of Forest directors were known to have smugly put it about that Derby would, \"soon be asking for their money back\". They were proved wrong when Hinton played 253 times for the Rams over the next 8 years, scoring 63 goals and winning two League Titles. Other Forest to Derby transfers in the late 60s/early 70s saw Terry Hennessey join Derby directly from Forest and Henry Newton  and Frank Wignall make the move after spells with Everton and  Wolves respectively in between. All of these players made telling contributions to Derby's regular triumphs from 1969 to 1975."]}]}}
