He made over 290 Football League appearances in the years after the Second World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Atyeo", "response": ["Again Bristol City started the season badly and were 20th with four games played. Atyeo began the season at inside right with Arnold Rodgers at centre forward and Cyril Williams at inside left. Jack Boxley became the regular left winger while Alec Eisentrager, Jimmy Rogers and Ernie Jones tussled for the position of outside right. Andy Micklewright newly signed in May 1953 from Bristol Rovers quickly made his presence felt playing in several positions across the forward line and ending the season as 2nd top scorer with 16 goals. Atyeo missed only one league game, a 0\u20135 defeat at Swindon Town in October, as Bristol City made a steady rise up the table before Christmas to start the New Year in 8th place and finish in 3rd position a full eight points behind champions Ipswich Town. Atyeo made 45 appearances and was the leading scorer with 22 goals, his highest seasons tally to date, as Bristol City netted 88 goals during the season. Atyeo was most prolific in mid season scoring 17 goals in a 20 match spell between the end of September and 20 February 1954 when he netted his first hat-trick for the club in a 5\u20131 win v Swindon Town. Atyeo also scored a goal in each of the three rounds of the FA Cup as Bristol City eventually lost 1\u20133 v Rotherham United in front of 29,216 fans in the 3rd round. Atyeo also scored in a series of first team friendlies arranged throughout the season which saw the likes of Fenerbache, Chelsea, Hajduk Split and Arsenal visiting Ashton Gate. Although Atyeo was the leading scorer in 1953\u201354 it was Arnold Rodgers who had the best ratio for scoring with 14 goals in 23 appearances.", "In 1955\u201356 Bristol City returned to the Second Division for the first time since relegation when finishing bottom in season 1931\u201332. There were no new names in the Bristol City team that took the field in the opening game a 2\u20131 win v Swansea Town on 20 August 1955 which was the Second Division debut for Atyeo. Two days later Atyeo scored the first of many goals in the Second Division in a 3\u20131 win at Rotherham United. Atyeo played at inside right throughout the season with Eisentrager as his regular right wing partner until Pat Beasley signed Wally Hinshelwood for \u00a315,000 from Reading in February 1956. Jimmy Rogers had his most productive goalscoring season with 25 goals from centre forward. Tommy Burden provided the skill and drive at inside left and Jack Boxley was on the left wing completing the regular forward line. Atyeo missed only 3 league games, all of which were defeats, two against Leeds United. Atyeo had a productive first half of the season scoring 20 goals in his first 19 games as the \"Robins\" stormed to the top of the table in mid November and remained at the summit until Christmas Eve. Atyeo scored a hat-trick (including a penalty) in a 3\u20131 win v Bury on 17 September and another hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win v Lincoln City on 3 December. City only won seven more league games after the win over Lincoln City and finished in 11th position in the final Second Division table as Atyeo scored only 10 more goals in the remaining 20 matches, still a good goals per game ratio. Overall Atyeo made 39 appearances and scored 30 goals in the league recording the highest total of league goals in a season in his career. This is the closest Atyeo came to the Bristol City record for goals in a season held by Don Clark with 36 goals in 1946\u201347. In the FA Cup a crowd of 46,493 saw City defeated 1\u20133 in the 3rd round at Everton. However the 46,713 who witnessed the 1\u20132 league defeat at Liverpool became the largest crowd to watch Atyeo in Bristol City colours, that is, until the following season. Frankfurt, Nice and Stuttgart Kickers were the European teams welcomed to Ashton Gate for first team friendlies with Atyeo a regular scorer in the friendlies.", "Bristol City struggled throughout 1956\u201357 hovering above the relegation places for much of the season before settling into mid table with a run of 8 league victories in 9 matches between mid February and mid April 1957. Atyeo started the season with five goals in the opening 4 matches playing mainly at inside right alongside Hinshelwood on the right wing. However, in mid November manager Pat Beasley sold both centre forward Jimmy Rogers and left winger Jack Boxley to Coventry City. This prompted the signing of Irish centre forward Dermot Curtis from Shelborne for \u00a35,000 in December 1956. Atyeo moved between inside right and centre forward depending on whether Curtis was playing in the team. Further forward line changes took place at much the same time as Bobby Etheridge signed from Gloucester City and young Johnny Watkins teamed up to form a new left sided partnership for Bristol City. As a result, only Hinshelwood with 41 appearances and Atyeo with 37 appearances were regulars throughout the season. Atyeo was the leading scorer again with 23 goals and Curtis the only other to reach double figures with 13 goals in only 16 games. Atyeo scored a league hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win v Sheffield United in January. Atyeo also created Bristol City history on 16 March 1957 scoring after only nine seconds of the match v Bury which City went on to win 2\u20130 with Atyeo scoring both goals. This still remains as the fastest ever goal scored in a match by a Bristol City player. In the FA Cup Atyeo scored doubles in both the 3rd & 4th round ties v Rotherham United and Rhyl. Atyeo also scored the goal in a 1\u20132 defeat at Aston Villa in the 5th round before a crowd of 63,099."]}, {"page": "Sid Williams (footballer)", "response": ["Williams played locally for Eastville United in Bristol. Bob Hewison signed Williams as an amateur in July 1937 from Eastville United for Bristol City. During the Second World War Williams represented Northern Command and guested for Darlington. He turned professional with Bristol City in July 1945. Williams made his debut in Third Division South replacing Jack Hargreaves on the left wing in a 4\u20130 win v Bristol Rovers on 1 February 1947. He made 13 appearances and scored 3 goals, all in the space of 4 matches in April 1947, as Bristol City finished 3rd in 1946\u201347. Williams began the following season 1947\u201348 at outside left but was replaced in October 1947 when 36-year-old Harry Osman was signed from Millwall. Williams ended the season with a run of games at outside right and made 28 appearances scoring 2 goals. Williams made only 13 appearances scoring 1 goal in 1948-49 as the \"Robins\" searched for a regular left winger to partner inside left Vic Barney newly signed from Reading. Bristol City continued to languish in the lower part of the Third Division South in 1949-50 finishing 15th with Williams starting the season at outside right and finishing on the left wing making 17 appearances scoring 3 goals. Williams did score both goals in a 2-0 Gloucestershire Cup win over Bristol Rovers. In 1950-51 Williams reclaimed the left wing position from Tommy Rudkin at the outset but then lost the shirt when Jack Boxley was signed from Stourbridge in October 1950. He made 25 appearances scoring 2 goals but played in all 5 FA Cup ties as Bristol City reached the 5th round eventually losing 2\u20130 to Birmingham City. In his final season 1951-52 Williams made only 4 appearances without scoring then joined local South Gloucestershire team Stonehouse in June 1952 who were managed by former Bristol City man Bill Thomas. After his playing career ended Williams became a self-employed decorator before retiring in December 1984 when he was living in Patchway near Bristol."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Rogers (footballer)", "response": ["Jimmy Rogers played locally for Rubery Owen in the Midlands and represented the Combined Services. Rogers joined Wolverhampton Wanderers from Rubery Owen in May 1948. Bob Wright signed Rogers on a free transfer in May 1950 from Wolverhampton Wanderers for Bristol City.

Rogers made only 8 appearances scoring 2 goals as Bristol City finished 10th in 1950\u201351. In the following season 1951\u201352 Rogers first appeared on the right wing in October. He returned to the team at outside left on Christmas Day with Bristol City in 20th place and promptly scored in 3 of the next 4 matches. This gave him a fairly regular place in the team firstly on the left wing and then at inside right. Bristol City ended the season in 15th place with Rogers making 22 appearances scoring 10 goals. Jimmy Rogers played intermittently and made 18 appearances scoring 4 goals in 1952\u201353 as the \"Robins\" rose to 5th place in the table. Rogers had two spells in the team on the right wing in 1953\u201354 making 13 appearances scoring 3 goals with City rising again to 3rd place in the Third Division South. When Bristol City won the Third Division South championship by 9 clear points in 1954\u201355, Jimmy Rogers laid claim to a regular place at outside right until January and then at centre forward when Arnold Rodgers suffered an achilles tendon injury. In season 1954\u201355 Rogers made 44 appearances scoring 25 goals including 15 goals in his 18 appearances at centre forward. Jimmy Rogers was the regular centre forward for Bristol City in their first season back in the Second Division in 1955\u201356 making 34 appearances scoring 25 goals including a hat trick in the 6\u20130 win v Plymouth Argyle on 27 December 1955.
