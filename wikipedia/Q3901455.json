They have been attributed to Zeno as emperor and to Armatus' son as Caesar; in this case Armatus' son would have changed his name from Basiliscus, the name of the usurper, to Leo, the dynastic name of Zeno's house (Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius, Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, , pp. 181\u2013182)."]}, {"page": "Sterling silver", "response": ["The British numismatist Philip Grierson disagrees with the \"star\" etymology, as the stars appeared on Norman pennies only for the single three-year issue from 1077\u20131080 (the Normans changed coin designs every three years).

In support of this he cites the fact that one of the first acts of the Normans was to restore the coinage to the consistent weight and purity it had in the days of Offa, King of Mercia. This would have been perceived as a contrast to the progressive debasement of the intervening 200 years, and would therefore be a likely source for a nickname."]}, {"page": "Tiberius III", "response": ["In 693 Justinian escaped from Cherson and gained the support of Khagan Busir, leader of the Khazars, who gave Justinian his sister Theodora as a bride, and welcomed him to his court in Phanagoria. In 703 reports that Justinian was attempting to gain support to retake the throne reached Tiberius, who swiftly sent envoys to the Khazars demanding that Justinian be handed over to the Byzantines, dead or alive. Justinian eluded capture, and sought the support of the Bulgar king Tervel. In 705 Justinian led an army of Slavs and Bulgars to Constantinople and laid siege to it for three days before scouts discovered an old and disused conduit which ran under the walls of the city. Later, Justinian and a small detachment of soldiers used this route to gain access to the city, exiting at the northern edge of the wall near the Palace of Blachernae, and quickly seizing the building. Tiberius fled to the city of Sozopolis in Bithynia, and eluded his pursuers for several months before being captured. The exact timing of Justinians siege and Tiberius capture is convoluted. According to the numismatist Philip Grierson, Justinian entered the city on 21 August, however, according to Byzantist Constance Head, Justinian seized the city on 10 July, and the 21 August date is instead the date where Tiberius was captured in Sozopolis, or else the date when he was transported back to Constantinople. On some date between August 705 and February 706, Justinian had both Leontios and Tiberius dragged to the Hippodrome and publicly humiliated, before being taken away to the Cynegion and beheaded. Their bodies were initially thrown into the sea, but were later recovered and buried in a church on the island of Prote."]}, {"page": "Roger III of Sicily", "response": ["Roger III (, ; 1175 \u2013 24 December 1193), of the House of Hauteville, was the eldest son and heir of King Tancred of Sicily and Queen Sibylla.

The same source and the other Lombard chronicles make Bisinus the father of Raicunda, first wife of Wacho, king of the Lombards. She may have been the daughter of Menia. Frankish sources, such as Venantius Fortunatus, make Bisinus the father of the three brothers who ruled Thuringia in the 520s: Hermanafrid, Bertachar (father of Saint Radegund) and Baderic. They are sometimes considered as sons of Menia,J\u00f6rg Jarnut, \"Th\u00fcringer und Langobarden im 6. und beginnenden 7.

B. Dewing (trans.); Anthony Kaldellis (eds.), The Wars of Justinian (Hackett, 2014), pp. 560\u2013566.

This attribution, first suggested by Jean Lafaurie in 1956, has been accepted by Egon Felder and Philip Grierson. A gold tremissis bearing the name CHLODOVIO RIX and the name of the moneyer, Eborino, probably belongs to him. Although it was possibly minted under Clovis IV, there is no evidence for the continuation of gold coinage in the Frankish kingdoms past the 670s. Likewise, late gold tremisses of Marseille bearing the name of Clovis probably belong to Clovis III. Stylistically, these have much in common with the coinage of Dagobert II, bearing the cross-on-steps motif on the reverse in imitation of Byzantine coinage."]}, {"page": "Tremissis", "response": ["The tremissis or tremis (Greek: \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03af\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, trimision) was a small solid gold coin of Late Antiquity. Its name, meaning \"a third of a unit\", formed by analogy with semissis (half of a unit), indicated its value relative to the solidus. It was introduced into Roman currency in the 380s by the Emperor Theodosius I and initially weighed 8 siliquae (equivalent to 1.52 grams).Philip Grierson, \"Tremissis\", in Alexander Kazhdan, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium (Oxford University Press, 1991 [online 2005]), vol. 3, p. 2113.", "In Frankish sources, the tremissis is sometimes called a triens, a term likewise meaning \"a third\", which originally referred to a bronze coin worth a third of an as.

In French historiography the term tiers (third) or tiers de sou (third of a solidus) is often used.
