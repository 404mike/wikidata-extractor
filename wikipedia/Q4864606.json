He was educated at St John's College, Portsmouth. Another pseudonym he used was Pat Merriman and he also published books under his own name. By agreement with the E W Hornung Estate, he continued the A. J. Raffles series after its creator E. W. Hornung's death, as well as other stories with his own characters.He married his uncle's daughter in 1933 and the marriage produced a daughter before it ended in divorce in 1948.\nHe joined the Army in 1940 and served three years in the infantry and three years in the Intelligence Corps.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Baudelaire", "response": ["The novel A Singular Conspiracy (1974) by Barry Perowne is a fictional treatment of the unaccounted period in Edgar Allan Poe's life from January to May 1844, in which (among other things) Poe becomes involved with a young Baudelaire in a plot to expose Baudelaires' stepfather to blackmail, to free up Baudelaires' patrimony."]}, {"page": "Raffles stories and adaptations", "response": ["*The Raffles character was continued by Barry Perowne with the approval of the Hornung Estate. Published in the story paper The Thriller during the 1930s and early 1940s, his series featured Raffles as a fairly typical contemporary pulp adventure hero and plays the role of detective alongside that of thief. When he picked up the series again in the 1950s, and once again during the 1970s, the stories were set closer to the late Victorian-setting of the original stories. Over the course of 50 years, off and on, Perowne produced around 60 short stories, some at novella length, and five novels featuring Raffles. Rare for a pastiche writer, Perowne's stories have been compared favourably with the originals.David Vinyard's review of Raffles Revisited is typical.", "*Several of Barry Perowne's Raffles short stories feature or reference Sherlock Holmes, including: \"The Victory Match\"; \"The Baskerville Match\" and \"Raffles and an American Night's Entertainment\"."]}, {"page": "E.

Hornung", "response": ["The character continued in book form: the writer Philip Atkey, under the pseudonym Barry Perowne, obtained permission from the Hornung estate to continue the Raffles stories, and seven more novels followed between 1933 and 1940, with Raffles transformed from a gentleman thief to a tough adventurer. Perowne continued the series in 1950, and 14 of his stories were published in the 1974 volume Raffles Revisited. Hornung's original stories have undergone a number of reprints, and when all the short stories were published in a single volume, Graham Greene considered it \"a splendid idea\". In 1975 Greene had written a play based on the Raffles stories, The Return of A. J. Raffles, which premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Denholm Elliott as Raffles."]}, {"page": "St John's College, Portsmouth", "response": ["* Barry Perowne novelist, best known for continuing the A.
