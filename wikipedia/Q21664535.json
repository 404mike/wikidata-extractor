He became a member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews in 1861 and via his thousands of golf illustrations of what were then the greatest golfers in the world he became known as \"the golf artist of St Andrews\".After his death, Hodge's work had for the most part fallen into obscurity and had been forgotten. Then, in 1983, a large cache of his watercolors was found in a battered and dusty red album and bought from an African antiques dealer peddling his wares at the Camden Lock Market. Many of the paintings were subsequently offered for sale at Sotheby's in 1985. It made perfect sense that Hodge's work was found collecting dust at the Camden Market \u2014 his last known address was only two miles away at Quex Road, just off the Kilburn High Road.A large collection of Hodge's paintings was donated to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club at St Andrews by Hodge's only living grandchild, Norah Sheward. Due to the notoriety of the Sotheby's sale, the Old Course \u2013 elated to receive such historical works on the history of golf \u2013 billed Hodge as \"artist to the Royal & Ancient Golf Club\" when the pictures were displayed by them at the University of St Andrews art gallery in April 1986.", "link_mentions": {}}}
