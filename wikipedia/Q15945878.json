She was likely to have been the first documented woman to join a police force in England and Wales, and to be attested immediately as a Constable. Later she was to become the first attested woman officer holding the rank of Inspector, and the first woman police officer to receive a pension on retirement.\nPrior to joining the police force she was a teacher of English in Germany. She later returned to England and taught German, Italian and French at a school in Salisbury, Wiltshire, reaching a senior post. In 1914, aged 41, she moved to the Bath and Bristol city area to join a group of women who had started an unofficial Women's Police Volunteers unit. She returned to Salisbury in 1918 to join the Constabulary proper at the City of Salisbury. Seven years later she moved to the Birmingham City Police and rose to the rank of Inspector. She stayed with the Birmingham force until her retirement in 1937.", "link_mentions": {}}}
