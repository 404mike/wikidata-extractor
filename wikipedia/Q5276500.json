James became known as Luke Sky, or simply Luke or L\u00fbke (short for \"Luke Skyscraper\" \u2013 a reference to the Star Wars character Luke Skywalker and the fact that James was tall and thin), while John Mulligan was known simply as Mulligan and Dik Davis simply as D\u00efk (or \"Dik Mamba\" on their debut single).", "By late 1981, Fashion\u2014which had now been picked up by Arista Records\u2014consisted of De Harriss (vocals, guitar), Martin Recchi (bass), Mulligan (synths) and Dik Daviss (as he now billed himself) on drums.  This line-up issued the single \"Move On\" in November 1981, and though it did not chart, the single still garnered enough attention to allow the band to record the album Fabrique (1982), produced by Zeus B. Held.  In addition to \"Move On\", Fabrique contained the singles \"Streetplayer (Mechanik)\" and \"Love Shadow\", both of which were minor UK hits.  Harriss (born David Harris) was now the band's frontman and songwriter, writing every song on the album (two were co-writes with Held).
