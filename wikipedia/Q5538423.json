He became known through a successful campaign by friends and supporters to free him from prison after his wrongful conviction in March 1975, for an armed payroll robbery at the London Electricity Board (LEB) offices in Ilford, Greater London, on 4 April 1974. The conviction was based solely on unreliable use of identification evidence, in the absence of other evidence connecting him with the crime. Following his release, Davis was jailed for two cases of armed robbery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Davis", "response": ["George Davis may refer to:", "*George Davis (actor) (1889\u20131965), Dutch-born American actor", "*George Davis (art director) (1914\u20131998), American art director", "*George Davis (author) (1939), American novelist", "*George Davis (editor) (1906\u20131957), American fiction editor and minor novelist", "*George Davis (American politician) (1820\u20131896), 4th Attorney General of the Confederate States", "*George Davis (Australian politician) (1833\u20131896), Victorian Legislative Council member, Minister of Defence", "*George Davis (New Zealand politician) (1873\u20131937), New Zealand trade unionist and local body politician", "*George Davis (baseball) (1870\u20131940), American baseball player and manager", "*George Davis (footballer) (1881\u20131969), England international footballer", "*George Davis IV (born 1987), American soccer player", "*George Davis (robber) (born 1941), British armed robber", "*George Davis House (Toronto), a designated house in Toronto"]}, {"page": "Norman Gunston", "response": ["* Norman Gunston interviews Vera Lynn, Margaret Thatcher, and George Davis.
