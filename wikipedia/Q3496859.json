It's a sort of gangster-horror film that involves a brain transplant (Curt Siodmak, who worked on the script, loved brain transplants). Stanley Ridges plays a part clearly meant for Karloff with Karloff playing a role that should have been played by Lugosi and Lugosi being wasted in a part that could have been played by anyone. The film is no classic but it is crisp and no-nonsense, taking advantage of Universal's studio resources, with excellent tempo; Joe Dante later commented it was more like a Warner Bros film in that respect than a Universal one, a judgement that could be made of many Lubin movies from this period.\""]}, {"page": "Task Force (film)", "response": ["* Stanley Ridges as Senator Bentley ", "When Cooper and Brennan attend the mid-1920s reception in Washington, D.C., the Chief of Naval Operations is called \"Admiral Ames\" (Moroni Olsen); the real CNO was Admiral Edward Walter Eberle.
