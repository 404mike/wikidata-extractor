At Assen, round four, Hayden scored his first podium finish with a third place in the opening race, running with the leaders before backing off in the closing stages. At Sepang, round six, Hayden qualified fourth on the grid behind the Kawasakis of Jonathan Rea and Tom Sykes, and the Yamaha of Alex Lowes. After an eighth place in the first race, Hayden made a good start in the damp conditions of the second race, and overtook Lowes into turn two, before challenging the Kawasakis for the lead. Hayden went around the outside of Sykes into turn five and followed Rea for the majority of the lap, making a strong move into the penultimate corner. Hayden established a four-second gap over Rea and the now chasing Ducatis of Chaz Davies and Davide Giugliano. As the race entered the last 10 laps, Giugliano moved into second ahead of Rea and Davies, halving Hayden's lead with four laps to go. Giugliano was one second behind coming onto the final lap but Hayden held the gap to win his first World Superbike race, taking Honda's first win of the season in the process."]}, {"page": "Fifth Gear", "response": ["* Week 1: Tiff and Jason test the Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG, the Audi R8 V10 Spyder and the Maserati GranCabrio to the limit to find out which is the best super cabrio on the market, the team test the new Range Rover Autobiography, Vicki races the BMW M135i against world super bike rider Chaz Davies on the BMW HP4 and Jonny drives 1000\u00a0km in Europe's cheapest car, the Dacia Sandero."]}, {"page": "Chaz", "response": ["*Chaz Davies (born 1987), Welsh motorcycle racer and 2011 World Supersport champion"]}, {"page": "EuroSpeedway Lausitz", "response": ["| World SBK || 1:36.634 || Chaz Davies || Ducati Panigale R || 2017 Lausitzring Superbike World SBK round"]}, {"page": "Ducati Desmosedici", "response": ["| align=left| Chaz Davies"]}, {"page": "2005 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season", "response": ["|  Chaz Davies", "|align=\"left\"|  Chaz Davies"]}, {"page": "Yamaha YZF-R6", "response": ["Chaz Davies helped Yamaha to win both the riders and manufacturers title during the 2011 Supersport World Championship season.
