He was born Harry Haley McClaskey and used Henry Burr as one of his many pseudonyms, in addition to Irving Gillette, Henry Gillette, Alfred Alexander, Robert Rice, Carl Ely, Harry Barr, Frank Knapp, Al King, and Shamus McClaskey.  He produced more than 12,000 recordings, by his own estimate, and some of his most popular recordings included \"Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight\", \"Till We Meet Again\" with Albert Campbell,  \"Beautiful Ohio\", \"I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\" \"When I Lost You\" and \"In The Shade Of The Old Apple Tree\". A tenor, he performed as a soloist and in duets, trios and quartets.", "It was around 1902 that he started to make recordings with Columbia Records and he used the name Henry Burr at that time. He arrived at a particularly opportune time for Columbia, as their star tenor, George J. Gaskin, was in the final years of his career. Burr started recording for Edison Records in November 1904 under the name Irving Gillette. Disagreements with company executives resulted in his no longer recording for Edison after October 1914. He first recorded with Victor on January 4, 1905, and the recordings were released that March. On April 7, 1905 he recorded Egbert Van Alstyne's \"In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree\" which proved to be popular. It was also recorded by Billy Murray the same year. Burr proved to be a successful artist, recording thousands of songs for various labels under various names. In particular, he was very popular in the 1910s, as he had the most #1 hits in the decade, according to Joel Whitburn's research. His most successful recording was of \"Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight\", which eventually sold a million copies. His total recordings were estimated to have sold around 240 million records. He would record with Leeds Talk-O-Phone, Angelophone and the American Record Company as well.  His recordings also appear on International Record Company and department store labels such as Vim Records.", "In 1906, Burr joined the Columbia Male Quartet, which was recording for the Columbia Record Company, as second tenor under the management of Frank C. Stanley. They were later renamed the Peerless Quartet when they moved to the Victor label. When Stanley died in 1910, Burr took over management of the group. It continued on as a popular recording and live group (with various personnel and name changes over the years) until 1928, when it disbanded. Burr was also a member of the Metropolitan Trio and the Manhattan Mixed Trio, both of which featured him with Frank C. Stanley and Elise Stevenson. In 1921, he contributed music to a summertime review called The Broadway Whirl.Playbill Vault, Henry Burr Broadway Theater credits", "By the late 1920s, Burr's recording career was over. Electrical recording technologies had encouraged the crooner style of tenor vocals, as in the singing of Gene Austin and Al Bowlly. The commercial potential of radio continued to interest Burr. He became involved in programming, forming Henry Burr, Inc. in 1928 as a producer. He produced numerous programs for commercial radio networks into the 1930s. He originated the Cities Service broadcast, which he produced for two years.", "* Henry Burr, tenor (1885-1941)", "* Henry Burr The First King of Pop Music", "* Henry Burr", "* Henry Burr", "* Henry Burr", "* Henry Burr recordings at the Discography of American Historical Recordings.", "* Art Makosinski: Henry Burr online Makosinski attempts to trace the convoluted changes in Burr's various quartets, trios and other ventures.
