During the late 1880s, he was also an amateur cricketer who played for Harrow, Cambridge University and Somerset. In 1882, he also played for the Gentlemen of England under W.G. Grace.\nBorn in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, Ramsay spent his early childhood in Australia, but moved back to England with his family in March 1874 to enable him and his older brother to receive an education. He attended Harrow and then Cambridge, and gained his sporting Blue at the latter, playing in the University match against Oxford in 1882. He made fifteen first-class appearances for Cambridge and Somerset in 1881 and 1882, but did not play any first-class cricket after that. In 1883, he left Cambridge without graduating and returned to Australia where, after working as a jackaroo at Winbar Station in New South Wales for nearly two years, he joined his brother Frank at Eton Vale, a large pastoral station on Queensland's Darling Downs owned by their father Robert Burnett Ramsay and Arthur Hodgson. At the time, Eton Vale was being managed by Arthur Hodgson's son Edward.\nBob Ramsay remained in Australia until his retirement in June 1920, when he returned with his wife and children to England and settled in Bekesbourne, Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Robert Ramsay (1818\u20131910), Treasurer of Queensland (1870\u20131871)", "*Robert Ramsay (1861\u20131957), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Robert Ramsay (1882) 4 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Bill Roe (cricketer)", "response": ["In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is described as a \"fine, free hitter with excellent defence\", who could also \"bowl a very useful medium-paced ball\".Ashley-Cooper & Haygarth 2004, p. 330. He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. \"C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain I should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!\" Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University at the end of the season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue\u2014the awarding of the Cambridge \"colours\" to sportsmen\u2014by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets.

The best players in the county, many of whom were not wealthy men, were unable to afford to play for Somerset. In turn, the cricket club could not afford to pay professionals to play for them, and were regarded as an occasional amateur outfit by many, rather than a side that could truly represent the strength of cricket within the county. The arrival of two professional players, and the acquisition of a permanent home ground in Taunton helped strengthen the club so that in 1882 they were admitted as a first-class county.Roebuck (1991), pp. 20\u201328. Bill Roe, at the time a schoolboy, rated Sainsbury as \"by far the best batsman in the side\" during their pre-first-class years. On 8 June 1882, Somerset played their first match to be universally considered first-class, against Lancashire. After losing the toss and fielding for over 150 overs as Lancashire scored 237, Somerset responded with a first innings total of 29 \u2013 their second lowest total ever in first-class cricket. Sainsbury and his fellow opening batsman, Fowler, top-scored for Somerset with 9\u00a0runs each, and both were once again the highest scorers in the second innings, when Fowler scored 18 and Sainsbury 17\u00a0runs out of a total of 51. Somerset were beaten by an innings and 157 runs, and batted for less than 70\u00a0overs. The county suffered further heavy defeats in their next two matches, losing to Gloucestershire and Hampshire, with no Somerset batsman reaching a half-century in either match. Sainsbury reached his first half-century in first-class cricket when Somerset hosted Hampshire at the County Ground \u2013 teammates Robert Ramsay and Stephen Newton also passed 50 for the county in this match, which helped Somerset to their maiden first-class victory. Sainsbury claimed a wicket in each innings of the match, during which he bowled just eight overs: in the first innings he bowled one over, conceding one run and claiming one wicket. In first-class matches in 1882, Sainsbury scored 255 runs at an average of 17.00, exceeding 50 on only one occasion. He bowled infrequently, claiming four wickets at an average in excess of 40."]}, {"page": "Ramsay (surname)", "response": ["*Robert Ramsay (disambiguation), several people", ":* Robert Ramsay (baseball) (1973\u20132016), pitcher for the Seattle Mariners", ":* Robert Ramsay (cricketer) (1861\u20131957), with Cambridge University and Somerset", ":* Robert Ramsay (Jacobite) (d.1689), Scottish military officer", ":* Robert Ramsay (Queensland politician) (1818\u20131910), Queensland politician", ":* Robert Ramsay (Victorian politician) (1842\u20131882), Australian statesman", "*Robert Ramsay Wright (1852\u20131933), Scottish zoologist"]}, {"page": "Robert Ramsay", "response": ["Robert Ramsay may refer to:", "* Robert Ramsay (Jacobite) (d.1689), Scottish military officer killed at the Siege of Derry", "* Robert Ramsay (Victorian politician) (1842\u20131882), Australian statesman", "* Robert Ramsay (Queensland politician) (1818\u20131910), Queensland politician", "* Robert Ramsay (baseball) (1973\u20132016), pitcher for the Seattle Mariners", "* Robert Ramsay Wright (1852\u20131933), Scottish zoologist", "* Robert Ramsay (cricketer) (1861\u20131957), cricketer for Cambridge University and Somerset"]}, {"page": "George Nash (cricketer)", "response": ["Very much a bowler, Nash's highest score batting in first-class cricket was 30.

Regt. of Foot, and his wife Margaret (n\u00e9e Cruickshank). He was the eldest child in a Scottish family of three sons and two daughters, the youngest of whom was the writer Elizabeth Ramsay-Laye, 1832-1932, who when she wasn't writing under her own name used the nom-de-plume Isabel Massary. Robert Ramsay was educated in Edinburgh and at Harrow. In 1836, with a military career in mind, he also attended L'\u00c9cole Sp\u00e9ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, founded by Napoleon in 1803.", "Having acquired the lease over Rosalie Plains on 15 June 1847, Ramsay went into partnership with Louis Hope in April 1848 and with him acquired Lagoon Creek Downs in October 1848, Cooyar station in August 1849, Kilcoy on 11 September 1854, East Esmond and East Crinum in November 1854 and at least two other stations in the Burnett area, Upper Crinum and Lower Crinum, at about the same time. Robert Ramsay's licence to depasture Rosalie Plains was transferred to the new partnership on 2 August 1848.", "Between 1848 and February 1866 when the partnership was dissolved, Hope & Ramsay invested huge amounts of money and time into the development of numerous pastoral properties on and close to the Darling Downs. Their holdings also included the pastoral interests at Mundubbera of Ramsay's younger brother Marmaduke following his death by drowning while crossing the Dawson River on 20 September 1865. An advertisement in the Brisbane Courier on 6 April 1866 reveals that the runs of  Ramsay and representatives of [his former business partner] the late  Jopp, who had also died by drowning, were transferred to Louis Hope and Marmaduke's brother Robert Ramsay on 1 April 1865. They included Hawkwood and Oaky Creek.", "In June 1859, confident that his pastoral interests were being properly looked after by paid managers, Ramsay went to England and Scotland for an extended holiday. He didn't return to Australia until 1865. Soon after his return, he entered into partnership with his good friend Arthur Hodgson, later Sir Arthur Hodgson, by buying former station manager John Watts' share of Eton Vale, a substantial station on the eastern Darling Downs that Hodgson and his brother Christopher had established 25 years earlier, and which had only recently been secured against selection by use of the pre-emptive right and provisions of the Leasing Act of 1866. Following the formal dissolution in February 1866 of his partnership with Louis Hope, who was by then actively involved in Australia's burgeoning sugar industry, Ramsay and his family moved into the Eton Vale homestead from where he took over the day-to-day management of the station. The business partnership between Ramsay and Hodgson not only went on to become hugely successful in its own right but led to the formation of the much larger pastoral firm of Ramsay Brothers & Hodgson, a partnership between Robert Ramsay's sons Frank, Bob, Lauderdale, Douglas and Norman, and Arthur Hodgson's son Edward, that made most of its fortune from merino wool in and around Winton in central Queensland. Although Robert Ramsay and Arthur Hodgson remained firm friends until Hodgson's death in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1902, their business partnership ended in 1893 when Ramsay purchased a 35,000 acre (14,164 ha) portion of Eton Vale for himself. He named it Harrow after his sons' old school in England and because Arthur Hodgson was an old Etonian who had named Eton Vale after his old school."]}, {"page": "Francis Ramsay (cricketer)", "response": ["The son of Robert Ramsay, he was born at Cheltenham in December 1860. His father had pastoral interests in Queensland, with Ramsay travelling with his family to Australia. There he was educated at Ipswich Grammar School. Upon the families return to England in 1874, he attended Harrow School. From Harrow he went up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. Despite being an avid cricketer, he never represented Cambridge University Cricket Club in first-class cricket, but did play minor matches for the club. Ramsay returned to Australia in 1880 to gain pastoral experience at Wellshot Station, before proceeding to takeover the management of Eton Vale. His brother, Robert, joined him in 1883 and together the pair made a series of land acquisitions in North West Queensland. They formed the Ramsay Bros partnership to manage these stations, partnering alongside Sir Arthur Hodgson. The partnership accquired Hodgson's  share of Oondooroo Station in 1887 and they quickly modernised into the most progressively run station in North West Queensland. Their partnership with Hodgson at Eton Vale was dissolved in 1893, with the land partitioned between the Ramsay's and Hogdson, with the Ramsay's share being renamed 'Harrow'."]}, {"page": "Frederic Willett", "response": ["The son of the physician Edmund Sparshall Willett, he was born at Marylebone in November 1853.
