Drivers including Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart, Jochen Rindt, Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Mario Andretti, Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet, and Keke Rosberg won the Formula One World Championship using Cosworth DFV engines during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.He was educated at Salvatorian College in Wealdstone and then apprenticed at De Havilland. In 1953 he started at Lotus, initially helping out on a part-time basis. Keith Duckworth joined Lotus in 1957 and they founded Cosworth Engineering in 1958. He later described himself as having \"studied for 40 years at the University of Duckworth\".In recent years he has been a consultant to the revived Triumph motorbike company.Mike Costin is the younger brother of Frank Costin, an aerodynamics and race car designer for Lotus, Lister and Maserati, and co-founder of Marcos Cars.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cosworth", "response": ["The company was founded as a British racing internal combustion engine maker in 1958 by Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth.

As Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, the co-founders of Cosworth, used to be Lotus Development Ltd employees, the initial racing adaptation of Lotus TwinCam was carried out by Cosworth, and the Kent block Cosworth SCA was designed using the basic SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head configuration of the FWE.  Due to Mundy being also the co-designer of the FWE, the Kent block Lotus TwinCam initially used the cam profile of the FWE, and shared the same valve clearance adjustment shims with Coventry Climax FWA, FWB, and FWE in production."]}, {"page": "List of companies named after people", "response": ["* Cosworth \u2013 Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth"]}, {"page": "Cosworth DFV", "response": ["Chapman approached Keith Duckworth, previously a gearbox engineer at Lotus but now running his fledgling Cosworth company with Mike Costin, who commented that he could produce a competitive three-litre engine, given a development budget of \u00a3100,000."]}, {"page": "Keith Duckworth", "response": ["After only three years with Lotus, Duckworth, along with fellow Lotus employee Mike Costin, founded Cosworth, a racing engine design and development firm, in 1958. Costin was obliged to remain with Lotus, having recently signed a restrictive contract; for the first few years Duckworth worked essentially alone at Cosworth until Mike could join him. From the start the company was closely associated with the Ford Motor Company and Lotus, and the two companies found early success in the newly formed Formula Junior in the early 1960s. Not only did these successes finance Cosworth's move from  Friern Barnet  Such Sweet Thunder book to  Edmonton, then to Northampton but they inspired Lotus founder Colin Chapman to persuade Ford to finance the production of Duckworth's DFV (double four valve) engine.", "The Cosworth DFV, and other engines based on the same design, became the standard in Formula One and many other types of racing and made Duckworth a very wealthy man. In 1980 he sold his majority stake in Cosworth for tax reasons but retained his position as chairman of the company; relinquishing the job to Mike Costin seven years later for health reasons.

With Duckworth having left to form Cosworth in 1958, Mike Costin, who, despite being the co-founder of Cosworth, remained with Lotus for a while longer, adopted the improved Queerbox in the Lotus 16, into a configuration for directly mounting it behind the engine for Lotus 18 with dedicated oil scavenge and pressure feed pumps, further improving its reliability while retaining the small and light design."]}, {"page": "1967 European Formula Two Championship", "response": ["|  Mike Costin", "|  Mike Costin", "|align=\"left\"|  Mike Costin"]}, {"page": "Lotus 23", "response": ["The scrutineers and the ACO did not change this position even after Mike Costin, the Lotus engineer on site, offered to go over structural analysis calculations showing the difference falls within the safety margin built in the design to accommodate more powerful  Cosworth Mk.IV and  Cosworth Mk.VII engines."]}, {"page": "Lotus-Ford Twin Cam", "response": ["After the initial design was finished, outside consultant Richard Ansdale produced detailed drawings of the new cylinder head.

Duckworth made several design changes, reshaping the ports and adding structure to the head.", "Cosworth founders Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin were both former employees of Lotus. Their new company developed the Twin Cam for competition use under Cosworth Project Code TA, with specific versions designated with an 'Mk.' prefix. One of the initial batch became the experimental Cosworth Mk.X in 1962. This was followed in 1963 by the dry-sump Mk.XII with racing camshafts designated the 'CPL2' (26/66/66/26) and high compression Cosworth pistons, used actively by Team Lotus in Lotus 20B, 22, 23 and 23B."]}, {"page": "Four-wheel drive in Formula One", "response": ["Trevor Taylor and Cosworth co-founder Mike Costin tested the car extensively, the first problem being the positioning of the oil tank, which for weight distribution had been placed directly behind the driver's backside, causing considerable discomfort.

A limited-slip front differential was tried with some slight success, but after Jackie Stewart briefly sampled the car reporting that \"the car's so heavy on the front, you turn into a corner and whole thing starts driving you\", confirming what Taylor and Costin already felt, Hayes withdrew his support and the Cosworth 4WD project was axed shortly before the British Grand Prix."]}, {"page": "John Crosthwaite", "response": ["In autumn 1955 he joined Colin Chapman who was starting Lotus cars. Crosthwaite worked in the Experimental Department at Lotus Engineering and helped develop and refine the Lotus 11 and Type 14 Elite.

He worked alongside Graham Hill, then a gearbox mechanic and Mike Costin, the 'Cos' in Cosworth. Keith Duckworth worked there during holidays from university. Cliff Allison was their most successful driver at that time.Sports Car and Lotus Owner (April 1957)", "Because of the increasingly competitive Formula Junior market, Crosthwaite decided to design a Dolphin Mk 2 in 1961 (also called the Dolphin International). Twenty six were produced. It had a tuned 997cc Ford Anglia 105E engine sourced from Mike Costin of Cosworth in the UK. The new body was drawn to be as small, smooth and aerodynamic as possible. After all the hours spent making Mk 1 body moulds they decided to produce a master 'plug' made of aluminium for the fibreglass body of the Mk 2. This 'plug' was produced to Crosthwaite's specification by the local racecar body shop of Troutman and Barnes.  Dolphin Engineering tooled up with jigs for all the welded parts and Crosthwaite designed cast magnesium wheels for the car. The Mk2 was successfully raced by ex pat Ken Miles (a close second place on its debut). Kurt Neumann won in a Dolphin International at Riverside in June 1962. Count Giovanni Lurani, who was instrumental in persuading the FIA to make Formula Junior an international class, described the Dolphin as the best American Junior constructed.
