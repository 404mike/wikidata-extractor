Indeed, his omission is one of the main reasons why many historians regard Nyren as unreliable.  The statistical record and contemporary reports both show that Veck was one of the outstanding batsmen of his time.\nVeck was a regular Hampshire player for nine seasons until 1784, but then left the game at age 28, apparently because he set up a business interest at Bishops Waltham, where he died in 1823.\nHe made 35 known first-class appearances between 1776 and 1784.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1776 English cricket season", "response": ["Richard Aubrey Veck made his debut in first-class cricket during the season."]}, {"page": "Alresford Cricket Club", "response": ["Its period of greatness roughly coincided with that of the even more eminent Hambledon, not too far distant.

The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three \"given men\" (i.e., borrowed players), on each side the match is also called Duke of Dorset's XI versus Sir Horatio Mann's XI after the two team patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann. The \"East Kent\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire. The \"West Kent\" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players Noah Mann and Tom Sueter with the Chertsey and Surrey players William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens. Noted Kent players involved in the match include Joseph Miller, William Bullen, William Bowra, Robert Clifford and Thomas Pattenden.Haygarth, pp. 47\u201348. Sevenoaks Vine was Dorset's home ground and there was a return match at Bourne Paddock at Mann's Bourne Park House near Bishopsbourne from 8 to 11 August. This also featured guest players with Surrey's William Yalden and Hampshire's James Aylward joining Small, Lamborn, Sueter, Bedster, Mann and Stevens.Haygarth, pp. 49\u201350.
