Indeed, his omission is one of the main reasons why many historians regard Nyren as unreliable.  The statistical record and contemporary reports both show that Veck was one of the outstanding batsmen of his time.\nVeck was a regular Hampshire player for nine seasons until 1784, but then left the game at age 28, apparently because he set up a business interest at Bishops Waltham, where he died in 1823.\nHe made 35 known first-class appearances between 1776 and 1784.", "link_mentions": {}}}
