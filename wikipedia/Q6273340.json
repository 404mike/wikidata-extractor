He achieved a first from the University of Surrey, and worked with Harry Kroto at the University of Sussex for his PhD.\nWhile Hare worked in Kroto's group for his PhD he was one of the first people to make and extract C60, Buckminsterfullerene, a football-ball shaped molecule.Jonathan Hare has worked behind the scenes on a number of television shows, as well as being one of the team of scientists on Rough Science and co-presenting Hollywood Science with Robert Llewellyn.  He worked with the Vega Science Trust,[1] an educational charity set up in 1994 by Sir Harry Kroto with the aim of promoting science via television and the internet. Hare has recorded a set of modules for teachers or as part of internet workshops and has contributed to the GEOSET educational project and created a number of popular science education videos.\nHe presents about 100 talks and workshops a year both in the UK and abroad. He has written a regular series for the Royal Society of Chemistry as well as published in reviewed journals and in science and electronics magazines, such as Practical Wireless and Elektor. He co-presents workshops at the Brighton Science Festival with the festival's creator Richard Robinson.Hare is a member of the Institute of Physics (IOP), Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) and the Radio Society of Great Britain (RSGB). \nIn 2000 Jonathan was awarded a NESTA Fellowship, in 2002 awarded an IOP Public Awareness of Physics Award and in 2006 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry.\nHare (G1EXG) has been a licensed radio amateur since 1984.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hollywood Science", "response": ["Hollywood Science is an Open University TV programme produced for the BBC, which attempted to determine whether or not scenes in various films were scientifically credible. In the show, presenter Robert Llewellyn and scientist Jonathan Hare look at the science behind a scene in a film. They experiment or perform calculations, to see how the scene would work in real life.  The scene is then given an accuracy rating. The approach is similar to that of the Bad Astronomer, who also uses films as a vehicle to teach science. The presence of Robert Llewellyn means the tone of the show is fairly light-hearted.", "*Jonathan Hare's Creative Science Center", "*Jonathan Hare's work with the Vega Science Trust Freeview Science Programmes."]}, {"page": "Rough Science", "response": ["* Jonathan Hare, chemist, physicist, inventor, and teacher", "This series takes place on the Caribbean island of Carriacou and features five scientists, including three (Mike Leahy, Mike Bullivant, and Jonathan Hare) from the first series.
