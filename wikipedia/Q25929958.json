The same month at the New Courts of Cannes Worm and George Lyttleton-Rogers lost to Tilden and Kingsley again. The next week at Gallia L.T.C. Worm and Joan Ridley had a shot at the mixed title but were stopped again by Tilden and Aussem. Then in February at the Carlton L.T.C. of Cannes doubles contest Paul Barrelet de Ricou and Worm met and lost to the two members of the Four Musketeers Jacques Brugnon and Henri Cochet. In the quarterfinals of the mixed draw in an encounter between Satterthwaite-Worm and Aussem-Tilden, chair umpire A. Wallis Myers became so upset of Tilden's attitude towards him after he overruled a service that he left the court. Official organizers' efforts to find another remained unsuccessful as the match continued without chair or line umpire. In the end Tilden's team closed the match with a score of 1-6, 6-0, 6-3. In March in their second Menton title defense attempt Kehrling and Worm lost in the semis to Tamino Abe and Aeschlimann when the title-holders were already serving for the match.  Hughes and Ryan prevented Worm and Satterthwaite in the mixed to claim their first Menton crown. In Beaulieu Worm and his recurring mixed partner Satterthwaite was unable to defend their title and ceded it to Pat Hughes and Violet Owen. In the South of France Championships the doubles were decided between Irishman Rogers and Worm and their opponents Tilden-Coen with the American visitors leaving with the title. In June he found a good partner in Tilden and became German Champions after winning the doubles at the Pfings-Turnier of the Rot-Weiss Club in Berlin."]}, {"page": "1930 in tennis", "response": ["|rowspan=2|February 17\u201323||rowspan=2|Hotel Bristol ChampionshipsBeaulieu-sur-Mer, France||  Harry Lee3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 7\u20135||  Bunny Austin ||  Joan Ridley6\u20133, 0\u20136, 6\u20134||  Violet Owen || style=\"background:#ededed;\" colspan=\"2\"|", "|rowspan=2|March 17\u201323|| rowspan=2|C\u00f4te d'Azur ChampionshipsCannes, France|| Bill Tilden6\u20133, 6\u20133, 6\u20134||  Giorgio de Stefani ||  Cilly Aussem6\u20130, 6\u20130|| Violet Owen || style=\"background:#ededed;\" colspan=\"2\"|"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Owen", "response": ["Geoffrey Owen is the son of L.
