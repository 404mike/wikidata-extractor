His work has been characterised by its interest in multiple cultural identities, subcultures, and its distinctive, \"musical\" use of language. His fans include the writer Zadie Smith, who has praised him for his \"humanness\", arguing that he is one of a few English writers who \"trade in both knowledge and feeling\". In 2002 The Times Literary Supplement named him as one of the Best Young British Novelists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 30", "response": ["*1968 \u2013 Diran Adebayo, English author and critic"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Diran Adebayo"]}, {"page": "Marsha Hunt (actress, born 1946)", "response": [" \"Saga that led to a miracle\", The Herald, August 8, 1995.
