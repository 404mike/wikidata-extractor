He won the British Rally Championship in 1996, and was also the runner-up in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2010. On the international stage his participation was limited, but he used his local knowledge to great success in the RAC Rally, where he won the Group N production car class twice driving a Ford Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4, in 1990 and Ford Escort RS Cosworth in 1993. In 1994, driving a Group A Ford Escort RS2000, he scored a then career high seventh place overall, winning his class once more, before going one better with a sixth place finish the following year, and his fourth class victory in six years.In 1997 he switched to SEAT, who were competing with their Ibiza GTI 16v, and later the C\u00f3rdoba WRC from 1999 to 2001. In 2002 he moved to MG and an MG ZR S1600, spending two years on the international circuit with Chris Patterson, and the British Championship with Claire Mole, after splitting with long-time co-driver Howard Davies.He drove a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution in the now renamed Wales Rally GB in 2004 and 2006, with the latter being where he won the 2006 Mitsubishi Evo Challenge Trophy. His prize was a works-prepared Lancer Evolution for the 2007 British Rally Championship.He now runs the family Ford and Suzuki dealership in Dolgellau, first established by his grandfather in Dinas Mawddwy in 1930, and renamed to Gwyndaf Evans Motors in 1983. The company now supports Gwyndaf's son Elfyn, who competes at an international level as a rally driver in the WRC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Gwyndaf Evans (born 1959), rally driver"]}, {"page": "SEAT Ibiza", "response": ["SEAT was not involved in the World Rally Championship after the 1977 season, until 1995, when, after an 18-year gap, they returned with an Ibiza 1.8-litre 16v driven by Erwin Weber in the Rally of Portugal, in the two-wheel-drive category. That same year, Weber won first place in the two-wheel-drive category in the Acropolis Rally, with Antonio Rius in second place.  The Copa Ibiza 16V also made its debut that year. The successes of the 1995 season encouraged SEAT to participate the following year in the World Rally Championship in the 2.0-litre engine category, with the SEAT Ibiza Kit Car, a decision which proved to be successful as SEAT won the 1996 FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup title, becoming the first brand to win the world title in its debut year. SEAT Sport in the next two seasons reaffirmed its domination, winning 2.0-litre WRC championship titles in 1997 and 1998, with drivers Harri Rovanper\u00e4, Oriol G\u00f3mez, Toni Gardemeister, J\u00f6rgen Jonasson, and Gwyndaf Evans."]}, {"page": "Dolgellau", "response": ["* Gwyndaf Evans, rally driver, winner of the 1996 British Rally Championship", "* Elfyn Evans, rally driver (son of Gwyndaf Evans)"]}, {"page": "Road rally", "response": ["While these changes were not as draconian as many had feared (for example, one of the most popular cars for road rallies at this time was the Mk II Ford Escort, usually fitted with a 2-litre+ high performance engine - many thought these would be banned in favour of a maximum capacity limit of 1300cc or even 1100cc), the changes had a dramatic impact. The loss of targa timing for example meant that organisers were forced to make the navigation much more difficult, and by eliminating preplot (decoding and plotting all route information prior to the start) in favour of so-called \"plot 'n' bash\" navigation, shifted the focus of the competition onto the navigation. This did not eliminate the high driving speeds since once the route was deciphered and plotted, it had to be driven - and the route plotting was now \"against the clock\" too. Another device to achieve the 30\u00a0mph rule was to use much tighter, twistier routes and green lanes (known in some areas as \"whites\", since such roads appear as white roads on Ordnance Survey Landranger maps) that could not be driven at high speed. Despite this, speeds were still high, and organisers developed a number of methods whereby the new rules were met, but some of the flavour of the older style events was retained (e.g. \"restart\" sections where competitors were held in a queue for a time in order to allow the slower crews to catch up - this dead time counted towards the overall 30\u00a0mph average, thus the rest of the rally could proceed at a higher speed without breaking the rules). Note that a 30\u00a0mph average is still quite high when the type of roads used is considered, especially as this average includes non-competitive link sections that may be timed at a very low average, such as 15 or 20\u00a0mph. However, with the elimination of commercial sponsorship, less money came into the sport and over time this affected the degree to which cars were able to be prepared by the average competitor. Many of the top road rally crews quickly moved into stage rallies - notable among them was one time Welsh road-rally demon Gwyndaf Evans."]}, {"page": "MG ZR", "response": ["MG Sport & Racing developed a number of MG ZRs to be used in club and national rallying.
