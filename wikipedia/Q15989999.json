The previous two party leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith had begun efforts to modernise the party as a strategy for electoral success before Smith died in 1994. Kinnock undertook the first wave of modernisation between the 1987 and 1992 general elections, with quantitative research conducted by Anthony Heath and Roger Jowell indicating that the electorate viewed Labour as more moderate and electable in 1992 than in 1987, arguably legitimising the arguments for increased modernisation. However, Smith's approach which was dubbed (sometimes pejoratively) \"one more heave\" was perceived as too timid by modernisers like Blair, Brown and Mandelson. They felt that his cautious approach which sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government was not sufficient. New Labour also used the party's brand to continue this modernisation and it was used to communicate the modernisation of the party to the public.Newman & Ver\u010di\u010d 2002, p. 51. The party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.Newman & Ver\u010di\u010d 2002, p. 48. Blair explained that modernisation was \"about returning Labour to its traditional role as a majority mainstream party advancing the interests of the broad majority of people\"."]}, {"page": "Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby", "response": ["*Professor Anthony Heath (1942-) Sociologist and fellow of Nuffield College"]}, {"page": "John Goldthorpe", "response": ["In 1969 he was elected to an Official Fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford, and remained there until his retirement in 2002.
