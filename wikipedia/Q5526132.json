He made 19 Third Division appearances in 1987\u201388, scoring five goals. He played 55 games in 1988\u201389, playing in partnership first with fellow centre-backs Phil Sproson and Bob Hazell (who both struggled with injuries) and later Gary West and Dean Glover (who were signed mid-season), alongside full-backs Alan Webb and Darren Hughes, in front of goalkeeper Mark Grew. This proved to be the most successful defence in the division, conceding just 48 goals in 46 league games. However a third-place finish meant that they had to overcome Bristol Rovers 2\u20131 over two legs in the play-off final, with Robbie Earle hitting both goals. Mills missed just one Second Division game in 1989\u201390, forming a formidable defensive partnership with Glover. He played 45 games in 1990\u201391, as Vale retained their second tier status. He played 40 games in the 1991\u201392 relegation season, scoring twice, and helped the club to win the TNT Tournament in the summer. However, in autumn 1992 he developed knee trouble and underwent a series of unsuccessful operations, limiting him to just three league appearances in 1992\u201393. He was given a free transfer in May 1994. After retiring as a professional, he later attempted a comeback with Northern Premier League Premier Division sides Boston United and Matlock Town."]}, {"page": "Alan Webb (footballer)", "response": ["He then played 47 games in 1988\u201389, scoring once in an FA Cup defeat to top-flight Norwich City. He played in the club's victory over Preston North End in the play-off semi-finals, but lost his place to Gary West for the final, in which Vale beat Bristol Rovers over two legs. He made only eighteen appearances in the subsequent Second Division campaign, having sustained a compound fracture in his right leg after colliding with Newcastle United's Micky Quinn on 28 October. He played six games in 1990\u201391 and appeared five times in 1991\u201392, but could not fully recover from this final injury and was forced into early retirement in June 1992."]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["The referee for the first leg was Allan Gunn from Sussex. The Port Vale starting line-up were largely the same eleven that defeated Preston, but with Gary West starting in place of Alan Webb. Bristol Rovers were reported to have reserve players Paul Nixon and Willmott on stand-by as Devon White, Phil Purnell and leading scorer Gary Penrice faced late fitness tests, though all three would start the game. Francis was though unable to name Geoff Twentyman, who was suspended, whilst loanees  Bailey and Ian Hazel both returned to their parent clubs.

Rudge then spent \u00a370,000 on Gillingham defender Gary West, as it became clear that Bob Hazell would be out injured for a long time. On 11 February, Vale won their first ever point in an away match at Huddersfield. Two days later they battled against the elements to record a 3\u20130 victory over Aldershot in the re-arranged fixture. Rudge tried to re-sign another former Vale favourite on loan, Mark Chamberlain, but was turned down.

The club soon scrapped their all-ticket rule after poor attendances in the first games. Vale went seven games without a win in the league, though on 23 September managed a 1\u20131 draw with Stoke at the Victoria Ground, some 27,004 fans in attendance. The police bills for Vale games reached as much as \u00a31.50 a head for some games, though the police went some way to justify this cost by arresting 85 people on the day of the Potteries derby. Rudge switched from a 4\u20134\u20132 formation to 4\u20133\u20133 so as to include Miller, and a mini-revival followed, ending with a 3\u20130 win over Barnsley at Oakwell. Six games without a win followed, and Alan Webb broke his leg during a 2\u20132 draw with Newcastle United at St James' Park. In November, Vale Park opened a new 48 seat disabled stand at a cost of \u00a3100,000. Ron Futcher was then sold to Fourth Division Burnley for \u00a360,000, though an injury crisis in defence exposed the club's lack of squad depth. With Gary West out with damaged ligaments, big defender Tim Parkin was bought from Swindon Town for \u00a360,000. The next month the Hamil End was reopened after \u00a3175,000 worth of renewal work.
