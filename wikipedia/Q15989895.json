Born in Cheadle, Staffordshire, he was educated at Kingswood School in Bath. In 1893 he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge University, to read Modern and Medieval Languages. He graduated with first-class honours. The fellows of Caius included the lawyer and legal historian Charles Henry Monro, who spoke Irish and encouraged Quiggin to study in this area.", "In 1909 Caius College used a bequest of Charles Henry Monro to create the Monro Lectureship in Celtic for Quiggin. This lectureship was the first of its kind and one of the forces which fed into the creation of the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. (The department has, since 1993, commemorated Quiggin through the Quiggin Memorial Lecture, in which series the fullest biography of Quiggin so far has been published.)Carey, John, The Irish National Origin Legend: Synthetic Pseudohistory (with a memoir of E. C. Quiggin by David N. Dumville) (Cambridge: Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, 1994); delivered as the inaugural 1993 E.C. Quiggin Memorial Lecture."]}]}}
