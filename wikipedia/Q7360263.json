It was brought back for a one-off event in 2013 to raise money to erect the Women of Steel statue.", "The event was traditionally held on Whit Tuesday, for which local steelworkers were given a day off, and was held annually from 1922 to 2000 apart from a 6-year break during the Second World War.  The first competitors raising money for charity entered in 1925.  By the 1930s a medal was being provided to finishers as well as the traditional mug of Oxo.  The 1947 event was won by Lol Allen who went on to represent Great Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.  The 1949 event was won by Roland Hardy, in his first competitive race he broke the course record by 53 seconds.  Hardy competed alongside Allen at the 1952 Olympics and also represented his country at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.  Hardy regarded the 1949 Star Walk as the most memorable race of his career.  At some time the route was changed; still starting at the High Street the walkers went through Hillsborough, Grenoside and Ecclesfield before finishing outside the Owlerton Stadium, a greyhound race track."]}]}}
