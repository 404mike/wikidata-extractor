Between 1962 and 1964, the overmatched Engineers managed just five victories. They managed to go 2\u20130\u20131 against their arch rivals. Frederick Dunlap arrived for 1965 and was faced with a major rebuilding job. Dunlap's first three teams managed two wins. The 1966 squad was particularly challenged, managing just 106 points and zero wins during the year. Dunlap's plan for improvement was to implement the Delaware Wing T offense in an attempt to score more points. This offense was popularized by Delaware coach Tubby Raymond and featured misdirection, ball handling, multiple runners and numerous passing targets. The offense was perfect for a team with smaller players like Lehigh. Within a couple of years, Lehigh's version, coupled with good recruiting resulted in scoring and eventually wins. By 1971, Lehigh, with quarterback Kim McQuilkin at the controls was scoring 362 points. The Engineers finished 8\u20133 that year and set a tone that would see plenty of points scored, many wins and a long line of excellent quarterbacks. Dunlap's teams would finish 36\u201313\u20131 (72%) over his final five years as coach. Dunlap returned to his alma mater Colgate University to coach and later serve as director of athletics. Dunlap's replacement was John Whitehead. Whitehead served as an assistant under Dunlap and success continued. Following a 6\u20135 first season, Whitehead led the Engineers to a remarkable 1977 season which resulted in a national championship. Lehigh had participated in two of the first three Division II tournaments (1973, 1975) so they were prepared for the rigors of post season play. Following a 9\u20132 year, Lehigh was invited to the tournament, but they had to play all games away from Taylor Stadium. Led by an explosive offense, Lehigh outlasted Massachusetts 30\u201323, outscored the University of California (Davis) 39\u201330, then clobbered Jacksonville State 33\u20130 in the Pioneer Bowl final in Texas. Lehigh spent one more season in Division II before joining the newly formed Division I-AA for the 1979 season.
