A month later, he found himself reunited with former teammate and fellow ex-Gillingham captain, Andy Frampton, when it was announced that he had also signed a contract with the South London club on 28 June 2013. On 31 July 2013, manager Neal Ardley appointed Alan Bennett as club captain and declared that Fuller would act as vice-captain for the 2013\u201314 season. Fuller made his league debut for \"The Dons\" in a 1\u20131 draw with Torquay United on 3 August 2013.
