From 1804 the privately operated service was funded by a subscription fund which was administered by a local committee led by Lord Suffield, the third baron of Gunton Hall. Other dignitaries on the committee included George Wyndham of Cromer Hall, Thomas Mickleburgh, a local merchant, Joseph Gurney, a Cromer draper and Benjamin Rust who was a grocer. This was the situation of the service until 1857, when with the lifeboat organisation falling into financial troubles and the lifeboats falling into a bad state of repair, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution took over the Cromer station along with other Norfolk Association stations. By this time the association had built a lifeboat house which once stood some 100 yards from the high-water mark close to what is now the inshore lifeboat station. The RNLI altered and renovated this station at a cost of \u00a346.2s.7d.\"Cromer Lifeboats 1804-2004\", Leach, Nicholas & Russell, Paul, Pub: Tempus Publishing, 2004,  but by the mid-1860s this station had outlived its usefulness and a new boathouse was planned. The new site was on the east gangway and in 1867 work started on the new station. The new boathouse work also  included building an extension to the sea walls and a slipway across the top of the beach. The work cost \u00a3476.4s.0d and was carried out by a local builder by the name of E. Simmons.

At the design process for this lifeboat, a number of meetings were held by the RNLI\u2019s chief inspector of Lifeboats, Captain the Hon H.W. Chetwynd and the service\u2019s surveyor Mr Prowse with the crew of the Cromer Lifeboat. At the meetings the lifeboat men were asked what their preferences were, when considering designs for the new lifeboat. The local men who were mainly fishermen expressed a desire for a new boat to be on the lines of the lifeboat which had been stationed there before 1858. These suggestions by local men, Mr James Davis, Mr James Mayes and Mr Thomas Blogg were very similar to the Norfolk and Suffolk Type lifeboats. By 27 November 1883 the surveyor, Mr Prowse, had agreed a design with the local fisherman, and an order was placed with James Beeching boat builders, of Great Yarmouth.", "The new lifeboat hull was constructed using the clench method fixed with copper fastenings. The keel was  deep and  wide, with an iron keel plate and a belt of cork. She was  long with a breadth of . The inside depth was . There were fourteen oars which were double banked and she was also equipped with a dipping lug sail. The lifeboat would be steered by either a rudder or sweep oars. Benjamin Bond Cabbell II had a watertight deck, with copper tubes and self-acting valves to release the water, and portable airtight cases round the sides of the boat between the deck and the thwarts. Cork-packed air-cases were placed under the deck in the wings of the lifeboat. These cases weighed 4.5 tons and drew  of water clear of ballast. The boat had a relatively light construction with a high bow and a raking stem. The keel was curved, typical of the north country-designed lifeboats first built in the late eighteenth century. The water ballast tanks had ten relieving valves and the rudder was retractable to prevent it being damaged when beach launched or during the recovery procedure.", "The Benjamin Bond Cabbell II was formally named and christened on 29 September 1884 by Mrs Bond Cabbell when she broke a bottle of claret over the boat, followed by a launch from the lifeboats carriage, whilst the band played Rule Britannia and the church bells rang. The Benjamin Bond Cabbell II was launched to only thirteen times during her service at Cromer, saving twenty six lives in the process. Her first service took place on 28 January 1888. Benjamin Bond Cabbell II was launched at 11:15 am to the brigantine Jane Marie of London which was bound from Hartlepool for Greenwich with a cargo of coal.
