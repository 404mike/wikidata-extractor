The 1860s saw the completion of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway with its terminal at Margate opening in 1863. This led to the construction of a number of resorts along the Kent coast to the west of Margate, including Westgate-on-Sea. Developed by the firm of Corbett & McClymont, which had a large property development and construction business in West London, many of the buildings in the town were designed by the company architect Charles Beazley."]}]}}
