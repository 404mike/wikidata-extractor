The 1945\u201346 season was uneventful and he seemed to settle into management quite well. In preparation for the first season of post-war football, he signed experienced forward Colin Lyman from Tottenham Hotspur for 'fairly substantial fee', full-back Garth Butler from Derby County, and half-back Norman Hallam from Chelsea. He sold goalkeeper Arthur Jepson to Stoke City for \u00a33,750. However, after a poor start to the season, he resigned in October 1946 over a policy difference with the club's directors. He claimed the board refused to back his suggestions for new players, interfered in team selection and failed to grant him a three-year contract \u2013 claims which the club denied. The \"Valiants\" went on to finish the 1946\u201347 campaign in tenth place in the Third Division South under Gordon Hodgson."]}, {"page": "Colin Chad Lyman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Lyman"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Of the 1938\u201339 squad there were six who returned for the 1946\u201347 campaign: goalkeepers George Heppell and Arthur Jepson; defender Harry Griffiths; and midfielders Alf Bellis, Wilf Smith, and Don Triner.
