Herts UK: Wordsworth Editions, 2009, p. x  but was \"not contented\" with the work. Despite Boothby's family tradition of colonial service, his natural inclinations ran more to the creative than to the administrative and he was not satisfied with his limited role as a provincial colonial servant. In 1890, aged 23, Boothby wrote the libretto for a comic opera, Sylvia, which was published and produced at Adelaide in December 1890, and in 1891 his second show, The Jonquil: an Opera, appeared. He also wrote and performed in an operetta, Dimple's Lovers, for Adelaide's Garrick Club theatre group. The music in each case was written by Cecil James Sharp. His first literary ventures were directed at the theatre, but his ambition was not appeased by the lukewarm response his melodramas received in Adelaide. Hence when severe economic collapse hit most of the Australian colonies in the early 1890s, he followed the well-beaten path to London in December 1891."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Adelaide", "response": ["| rowspan=2 | Lewis Cohen"]}, {"page": "Morphett Street, Adelaide", "response": ["Morphett Street continues north of North Terrace as Montefiore Road, and south of South Terrace as Sir Lewis Cowen Avenue.
