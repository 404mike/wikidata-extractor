When invited to go on holiday in Spain with her daughter Lily Haddon (Stephanie Bidmead) and family, Martha bought her first passport and proudly showed it off to anyone who showed the slightest interest. It was during a singsong at a party in the Rovers thrown by Frank Barlow to celebrate his selling his shop that Martha became ill and retreated to her usual chair in the empty snug. Unnoticed by anyone else, Martha had a sudden heart attack which killed her almost instantly. She was eventually spotted by Myra Booth (Susan Jameson), who thought that she had fallen asleep. When Jack Walker failed to revive her, he alerted Annie and Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson). While Jack called for a doctor, the revellers stopped singing and looked towards the snug one by one. Ena, on the harmonium, was the last to notice. Failing to find a pulse, Len declared Martha dead.", "Martha was the first character to have an on-screen burial. The graveside scenes were shot on location at Manchester General Cemetery in Harphurey on Tuesday 12 May. The episode featuring Martha's death was shown with silent end credits played over a shot of Martha's glasses, passport and sherry glass on the snug table she was sitting at when she died. Carol played Martha one further time; her voice was heard in the following episode, when Ena and Minnie played an old recording of Martha's in which she and an unknown man called Philip proclaimed their love for each other. The same episode featured Stephanie Bidmead as Lily Haddon, Martha's daughter who previously had been spoken of frequently but never seen."]}, {"page": "King Charles I School", "response": ["* Stephanie Bidmead, actress, notably in Doctor Who"]}, {"page": "Running Scared (1972 film)", "response": ["* Stephanie Bidmead as Mrs. Case"]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Lily Haddon || Stephanie Bidmead || 1964"]}, {"page": "Bedtime Stories (1974 TV series)", "response": ["*Stephanie Bidmead as Linda Weir"]}, {"page": "Crane (TV series)", "response": ["11.
