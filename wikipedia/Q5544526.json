This was at the time the highest fee which Gillingham had ever received for a player.  Despite having lost the highest-scoring player of the previous season, the club did not immediately sign any new forwards; the only two players to join the club ahead of the new season were George Shipley, a midfielder signed from Charlton Athletic for \u00a340,000, and Gary West, a defender who arrived from Lincoln City for \u00a350,000.  The Gillingham team prepared for the new season with several friendly matches and the club also staged an open day, when supporters could attend autograph sessions with players and watch them training.  The club's first-choice kit featured shirts in the club's traditional blue with a white zigzag band across the chest; the second-choice shirts, to be worn in the event of a clash of colours with the opposition, were the reverse of this.  At the start of the season, Gillingham were anticipating playing at Wembley Stadium, England's national stadium, for the first time in the club's history, as all 92 League teams were originally set to play there in April 1988 in the Football League Centenary Tournament.  The format of the tournament was later significantly changed, however, such that only 16 teams would compete.  Gillingham failed to qualify for the revised tournament and did not make their first appearance at Wembley until 1999."]}]}}
