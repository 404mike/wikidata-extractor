Crime is a convention, pursuit an intellectual exercise, and it is as if the murderer of the odious financier did but poison in jest. The characters are lightly and deftly sketched and an antiseptic breeze of humour prevails. It is a pleasure to read an author so nicely conscious of the limitations of what she is attempting.\"  He concluded, \"Miss Christie has a reputation for playing fair with the reader who likes to assume detective responsibility, and also for being one too many for him. In the present case it may be felt that the hidden mechanism of the plot is ingenious at the expense of probability, but the tale is told with such confidence that (like murder itself, in this pastoral atmosphere) it does not matter very much.\""]}, {"page": "Hickory Dickory Dock (novel)", "response": ["Philip John Stead's review in the Times Literary Supplement of 23 December 1955 began: \"Poirot's return to the happy hunting grounds of detective fiction is something of an event. He is called upon to solve the mystery of a series of apparently trivial thefts at a student's hostel but soon finds himself partnering the police in investigating murder. Mrs Christie rapidly establishes her favourite atmosphere by her skilful mixture of cheerfulness and suspense.\" After summarising the plot he concluded, \"The amount of mischief going on in the hostel imposes some strain on the reader's patience as well as on Poirot's ingenuity; the author has been a little too liberal with the red herrings. Yet the thumb-nail sketches of the characters are as good as ever and in spite of the over-elaborate nature of the puzzle there is plenty of entertainment.\"The Times Literary Supplement, 23 December 1955 (p. 773)"]}, {"page": "Destination Unknown (novel)", "response": ["Philip John Stead writing in The Times Literary Supplement in its review of 19 November 1954, was enthusiastic about the novel in posing the question, \"Where do scientists go when they vanish from the ken of the Security Services? A solution to this fascinating problem is propounded in Destination Unknown. While it must be admitted that the secret, when disclosed, smacks rather of The Thousand and One Nights than of modern international rivalry for scientific talents, it may surely be excused on the ground that it provides Mrs Christie with a story-tellers holiday from the rigours of detective fiction. Readers may regret the absence of the tonic logicalities of crime's unravelling \u2013 though \"clues\" are not altogether missing \u2013 for the secret service story belongs largely to Adventure, but in their place is the author's obvious pleasure in the wider horizons of the more romantic genre.\" The review concluded, \"However much the purist yearns for Poirot or Miss Marple, he can hardly deplore Mrs Christie's bright, busy excursion into this topical and extravagant sphere.\""]}, {"page": "4.50 from Paddington", "response": ["Philip John Stead's review in The Times Literary Supplement (29 November 1957) concluded that \"Miss Christie never harrows her readers, being content to intrigue and amuse them.\" "]}, {"page": "Ordeal by Innocence", "response": ["Philip John Stead concluded his review in the Times Literary Supplement of 12 December 1958, with, \"The solution of Ordeal By Innocence is certainly not below the level of Mrs Christie's customary ingenuity, but the book lacks other qualities which her readers have come to expect. What has become of the blitheness, the invigorating good spirits with which the game of detection is played in so many of her stories? Ordeal By Innocence slips out of that cheerful arena into something much too like an attempt at psychological fiction. It is too much of a conversation piece and too many people are talking \u2013 people in whom it is hard to take the necessary amount of interest because there is not enough space to establish them. The kind of workmanship which has been lavished on this tale is not a kind in which the author excels and the reader feels that Miss Marple and Poirot would thoroughly disapprove of the whole business.\""]}, {"page": "Paul Paillole", "response": ["After the war Paillole devoted much energy to defending the reputation of his services trying to show that they were pro-Allied from the outset and engaged in unambiguous Resistance.
