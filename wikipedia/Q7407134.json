The show is also noted for its veristic portrayal of human life through a general lack of conventional character development in Mark and Jeremy, and their purgatorial lifestyle together from their twenties to their forties as a result of their shared inability to change. The show has been described by co-creator Sam Bain as portraying \"the stubborn persistence of human suffering\", and, through the exploration of existentialism and loneliness, as a realistic portrayal of \"why ordinary people are evil\".", "Writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain met actors/writers Mitchell and Webb during a failed attempt to complete a team-written sitcom for the BBC. They had an old, unproduced script that they wanted to revive called All Day Breakfast and brought in Mitchell and Webb to help out. The show did not work out but the four developed as a partnership, and one idea eventually evolved into Peep Show for Channel 4. Peep Show was originally conceived as a sitcom in the style of Beavis and Butt-head revolving around two characters watching and discussing television. However, the idea was dropped due to the large expense that airing clips from other shows would bring as well as Mitchell and Webb's fear that, because their characters would only be watching television, \"[they] wouldn't be in the show\".", "In May 2019, Sam Bain, co-creator of the original Peep Show series, confirmed in a Guardian article that another US remake is in the works in collaboration with FX Networks.
