Irene's interest in geology brought her attention to Frederick Chapman - who was a palaeontologist at the National Museum of Victoria. Irene became his assistant and later replaced his role as a palaeontologist in the Department of the Interior - receiving half his salary, equipment and office space because she was a woman. Crespin began her research by examining and locating fossils across Australia.", "She took her B.A. from the University of Melbourne in 1919, in which she studied to become a teacher. Here, she fell under the influence of Frederick Chapman, whose assistant she became in December 1927. From here she assisted Chapman in his study and search to discover oils and minerals in the area.", "On 1 January 1936 she succeeded Chapman as a palaeontologist in the Department of the Interior. It was a high honor to continue with Chapman's work, but unfortunately Crespin was severely underpaid: her salary was half that of Frederick Chapman, and had to continue on working with insufficient tools and lesser than desirable working environment. A driving desire to continue her geological studies resulted in Crespin moving to Canberra to be in contact with the Commonwealth's geological adviser Walter George Woolnough. During her career she published some ninety papers\u2014including notable work on foraminifera\u2014as sole author and more than twenty in collaboration with other scientists.Margaret E. Bartlett, Crespin, Irene (1896 - 1980), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, MUP, 1993, pp 532\u2013533. In 1939, Crespin traveled to Java and Sumatra, Indonesia, to discuss with micro-palaenontologists who were in government service and industry, regarding the problems that existed with Tertiary correlation in the Indo-Pacific region. Crespin was invited to visit the US in 1951 to address the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and engage in a three month tour, the first time an Australian had been asked to speak to this group. It was reported that opposition to her taking up this offer was strong from within the government. She was warmly welcomed by geologists across the United States.
