The result is comparable in sound to ragtime or stride piano styles. Blues researcher Peter B. Lowry coined the term, giving co-credit to fellow folklorist Bruce Bastin. The Piedmont style is differentiated from other styles, particularly the Mississippi Delta blues, by its ragtime-based rhythms."]}, {"page": "Blind Boy Fuller", "response": ["He married young, to Cora Allen, and worked as a laborer.

He went to see a doctor in Charlotte who allegedly told him that he had ulcers behind his eyes, the original damage having been caused by some form of snow-blindness.\" Only the first part of this diagnosis was correct.

The uncertainty stems from confusion over when she first met Willie and whether or not this was after he had recorded with Glaze. Bruce Bastin gave the year of their meeting as 1931,Bastin (1986). p. 133. at her graduation from Paine College, in Augusta, Georgia, and stated that immediately afterward she went on to Washington High in Atlanta, which is where and when Willie recorded with Glaze. Bastin also noted the similarities between Glaze's spoken parts in \"Searching the Desert for the Blues\" and the ones in the McTells' recording of \"Ticket Agent Blues\" in 1935. As mentioned above, McTell told the musicologist David Evans and his family that she had met Willie in late 1931 and that they recorded soon afterward over the course of a week.
