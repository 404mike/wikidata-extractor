He plays as a striker or attacking midfielder.\nHe started his career as an apprentice at Chesterfield, and made his debut on 14 May 1983 as a substitute in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Millwall in the Third Division. In December 1986, Ernie Moss and Brown were transferred to Stockport County for a joint fee of \u00a310,000. In the summer of 1987 he moved to Lincoln City, who had recently become the first club to be automatically relegated out of the Football League. He was the leading goalscorer as the Imps secured their return to the league at the first attempt. He spent a further two seasons with Lincoln before moving into non-League football with Kettering Town, where he was leading scorer in the 1992\u201393 season, Boston United, and Gainsborough Trinity.\nBrown was originally signed by Matlock Town in 2002 as a player, but he and Gareth Williams were made joint player-managers in 2004 after previous manager Ernie Moss left for Hucknall Town. The pair remained in post for more than four years until sacked in October 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gainsborough Trinity F.C.", "response": ["|2001||align=left| Phil Brown & Frank Nicholson||Caretakers||27 October 2001||17 November 2001||5||2||1||2"]}, {"page": "Phil Brown (1966 footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Phil Brown (footballer, born 1966)"]}, {"page": "Phil Brown", "response": ["Phil Brown may refer to:", "*Phil Brown (actor) (1916\u20132006), American stage, film, and TV actor", "*Phil Brown (basketball coach), Australian basketball coach", "*Phil Brown (footballer, born 1959), English football manager and former player", "*Phil Brown (footballer, born 1966), English player-manager with Matlock Town", "*Phil Brown (skier) (born 1991), Canadian slalom skier", "*Phil Brown (sprinter) (born 1962), British runner, Olympic Games medalist", "*Phil Brown (American football) (1901\u20131991), American college football and basketball coach"]}, {"page": "Ernie Moss", "response": ["His time at Sincil Bank was brief and he finished the 1983\u201384 season with Doncaster Rovers, as Rovers were promoted from the Fourth Division as runners-up under the management of Billy Bremner. In 1984 Moss signed with Chesterfield for a third time, now under the leadership of John Duncan. He won promotion from the fourth tier for the fourth time, Chesterfield coming up as champions in his first season back at Saltergate. The 1985\u201386 season was one of consolidation for Chesterfield, and his goals helped greatly. The Saltergate faithful were therefore taken by surprise when he was sold to Fourth Division Stockport County in December 1986, along with Phil Brown, for a combined fee of \u00a310,000. County finished in mid-table, and Moss left at the end of the 1986\u201387 campaign. He was with Conference champions Scarborough for their first season in the Football League under Neil Warnock. He also had a short spell with strugglers Rochdale, scoring twice in ten games for Eddie Gray's side, before his career in the Football League came to an end."]}, {"page": "Bob Newton (footballer, born 1956)", "response": ["The following season, he joined his hometown club Chesterfield, with Martin Henderson and \u00a38,000 going to Port Vale. Newton spent two seasons at Saltergate and topped the Spireites' goalscoring chart in both seasons, forming a powerful front three with Phil Brown and Ernie Moss. After leaving Chesterfield Newton returned to Hartlepool in the summer of 1985 on the promise of better wages."]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Football Conference", "response": ["|12||align=left| Phil Brown ||align=left| Lincoln City ||16||1||2||1||20"]}]}}
