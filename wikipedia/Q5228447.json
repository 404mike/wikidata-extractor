In two years at Blundell Park he made 69 appearances.\nHe returned to the west coast in 1988 when he joined Sam Ellis' Blackpool. He made just over 100 appearances for the Seasiders in five years, and was a member of the team that won the Fourth Division play-off final at Wembley in May 1992. This was after sitting out the entire 1990-91 season through injury.\nDuring the following season he was loaned out to Carlisle United for a month, and made the move permanent later that season.\nHe spent a year with the Cumbrians, making 40 appearances and scoring one goal.\nAnother loan spell followed, this time at Hartlepool United, before moves to Northwich Victoria and Bamber Bridge, with whom he finished his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Morgan (footballer, born 1968)", "response": ["A strong, well-built player, he was comfortable in either a defensive or midfield role, and spent much of his early career deep in defence alongside Dave Burgess or Mike Davies.
