He previously played for the Widnes Vikings in the Super League. Signing for St. Helens from amateur side Blackbrook ARLFC, Johnson plays as either a prop or second-row. He has international honours at amateur level, having featured for Great Britain Community Lions. He was only recently promoted to the first team from the reserves (in doing so was awarded the No. 32 jersey), so he has yet to make a first team appearance. He was named in his first 19-man squad ahead of the derby with Wigan Warriors on Friday 31 July 2009. He also made the 19 for the 21 August 2009 game against the Huddersfield Giants but again dropped out.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Johnson", "response": ["Paul Johnson may refer to:", "*Paul Johnson (producer) (1971\u20132021), American producer and DJ", "*Paul Johnson (singer), British soul singer of the 1980s", "*Paul Johnson (guitarist), American", "*Paul Johnson (American politician) (born 1959), former mayor of Phoenix, Arizona", "*Paul Johnson (Canadian politician) (born 1952), former Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament", "*K.
