His Critical History of England (1724-1726) contains attacks on Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon and a defence of Bishop Gilbert Burnet, and its publication led to a controversy between Dr Zachary Grey and the author, who replied to Grey in his Clarendon and Whitlock Compared (1727).  On the same lines he wrote his History of England During the Reigns of the Royal House of Stuart (1730).  Herein he charged Francis Atterbury and other editors with tampering with the text of the History. From his exile Atterbury replied to this charge in a Vindication, and although Oldmixon continued the controversy it is practically certain that he was in the wrong."]}, {"page": "Daniel Neal", "response": ["This History of the Puritans (book) deals with the time between the Protestant Reformation and 1689; the first volume appearing in 1732, and the fourth and last in 1738.
