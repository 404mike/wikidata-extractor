Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.  H\u0113s\u00edodos, 'he who emits the voice') was an ancient Greek poet generally thought to have been active between 750 and 650 BC, around the same time as Homer.M. L. West, Hesiod: Theogony, Oxford University Press (1966), p. 40.Jasper Griffin, \"Greek Myth and Hesiod\", J.Boardman, J.Griffin and O. Murray (eds.), The Oxford History of the Classical World, Oxford University Press (1986), p. 88. He is generally regarded as the first written poet in the Western tradition to regard himself as an individual persona with an active role to play in his subject.Barron, J. P., and Easterling, P. E., \"Hesiod\" in The Cambridge History of Classical Literature: Greek Literature, P. E. Easterling and B. Knox (eds.), Cambridge University Press (1985), p. 92. Ancient authors credited Hesiod and Homer with establishing Greek religious customs.Andrewes, Antony, Greek Society, Pelican Books (1971), p. 254 f. Modern scholars refer to him as a major source on Greek mythology, farming techniques, early economic thought,Rothbard, Murray N., Economic Thought Before Adam Smith: Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought, vol. 1, Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar Publishing (1995), p. 8; Gordan, Barry J., Economic Analysis Before Adam Smith: Hesiod to Lessius (1975), p. 3; Brockway, George P., The End of Economic Man: An Introduction to Humanistic Economics, 4th edition (2001), p. 128. archaic Greek astronomy and ancient time-keeping.", "Unlike his father, Hesiod was averse to sea travel, but he once crossed the narrow strait between the Greek mainland and Euboea to participate in funeral celebrations for one Athamas of Chalcis, and there won a tripod in a singing competition.Jasper Griffin, 'Greek Myth and Hesiod' in The Oxford History of the Classical World, J. Boardman, J. Griffin and O. Murray (eds), Oxford University Press (1986), pp. 88, 95. He also describes a meeting between himself and the Muses on Mount Helicon, where he had been pasturing sheep when the goddesses presented him with a laurel staff, a symbol of poetic authority (Theogony 22\u201335). Fanciful though the story might seem, the account has led ancient and modern scholars to infer that he was not a professionally trained rhapsode, or he would have been presented with a lyre instead.See discussion by M. L. West, Hesiod: Theogony, Oxford University Press (1966), p. 163 f., note 30, citing for example Pausanias IX, 30.3. Rhapsodes in post-Homeric times are often shown carrying either a laurel staff or a lyre but in Hesiod's earlier time, the staff seems to indicate that he was not a rhapsode, a professional minstrel. Meetings between poets and the Muses became part of poetic folklore: compare, for example, Archilochus' account of his meeting the Muses while leading home a cow, and the legend of C\u00e6dmon.", "Some scholars have seen Perses as a literary creation, a foil for the moralizing that Hesiod develops in Works and Days, but there are also arguments against that theory.Hugh G. Evelyn-White, Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns and Homerica (= Loeb Classical Library, vol. 57), Harvard University Press (1964), p. xiv f. For example, it is quite common for works of moral instruction to have an imaginative setting, as a means of getting the audience's attention,Jasper Griffin, 'Greek Myth and Hesiod' in The Oxford History of the Classical World, Oxford University Press (1986), cites for example the Book of Ecclesiastes, a Sumerian text in the form of a father's remonstrance with a prodigal son, and Egyptian wisdom texts spoken by viziers, etc. Hesiod was certainly open to oriental influences, as is clear in the myths presented by him in Theogony. but it could be difficult to see how Hesiod could have travelled around the countryside entertaining people with a narrative about himself if the account was known to be fictitious.Griffin, 'Greek Myth and Hesiod' in The Oxford History of the Classical World, p. 95. Gregory Nagy, on the other hand, sees both P\u00e9rs\u0113s (\"the destroyer\" from , p\u00e9rth\u014d) and H\u0113s\u00edodos (\"he who emits the voice\" from , h\u00ed\u0113mi and , aud\u1e17) as fictitious names for poetical personae.Gregory Nagy, Greek Mythology and Poetics, Cornell (1990), pp. 36\u201382."]}, {"page": "Ancient Greek literature", "response": ["The other great poet of the preclassical period was Hesiod.

Works and Days is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers. Theogony is a systematic account of creation and of the gods. It vividly describes the ages of mankind, beginning with a long-past Golden Age.Jasper Griffin, \"Greek Myth and Hesiod\", J.
