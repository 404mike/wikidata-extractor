Maslanka (born 27 October 1954) is a British writer and broadcaster, specialising in puzzles and problem solving.\nHe was born in Clapham, London, but was brought up by his uncle and aunt in Lowdham, Nottingham. He was educated at The Becket School, Nottingham, where he was a successful chess player, and went on to study physics at St Catherine's College, Oxford.\nHis first book \u2013 The Pyrgic Puzzler \u2013 a collection of 80 puzzles with illustrations by Michael Harrington, was written without any particular view to publication, but was taken up by Iris Murdoch who wrote an introduction for it in which she said that although she's not a great solver of puzzles, the book may be 'read as literature' just as in the case of Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Bible.\nHe was invited by Alan Rusbridger to submit puzzles to Weekend Guardian and his two puzzle columns: Wordplay and Pyrgic Puzzles have appeared in the Saturday edition of the newspaper for 20 years. Maslanka is also the quizmaster for New Humanist magazine.A book interview with David Freeman at BBC Radio Oxford led to Maslanka's contributing anecdotes and puzzles to many programmes and in 1992-3 he co-hosted the Saturday afternoon show PDQ 95.2 with Andrew Peach. \nHe was also invited by the World Service to broadcast his humorous puzzle anecdotes to the hostages during the Gulf War.\nMaslanka designed the puzzles for Harry Horse's 1996 computer game, Drowned God.He presented the BBC Radio 4 programme Puzzle Panel which was broadcast between 1998 and 2005.He has retained his association with St Catherine's College, Oxford who have created a special post for him, that of a  \"College Enigmatist\".In 2018, he presented a radio series for BBC Radio 4 on the history of puzzling, entitled Two Thousand Years of Puzzling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Puzzle Panel", "response": ["Puzzle Panel was a light-hearted, though cerebral BBC Radio 4 panel game that was broadcast between 1998 and 2005.

It has been written and presented by puzzle columnist for The Guardian, Chris Maslanka.", "During the opening introduction, Chris Maslanka would present a few short puzzles for the listeners and panellists to work on during the course of the programme.

Horse worked with Inigo Orduna and Anthony McGaw for six months designing the game, then cooperated with the game's artists and modelers until the project's completion. The game's producer, Algy Williams, hired puzzle expert Chris Maslanka, whose output he called \"fiendishly difficult\", to design the game's puzzles together with John Morris. Williams also employed sculptor Greg Boulton, who had previously worked on the Peter Gabriel video \"Sledgehammer\". Drowned God music was written and performed by an ambient music duo operating under the name Miasma. William S. Burroughs was originally scheduled to narrate the game, but died just before he could begin recording. McGaw and Williams later founded the company Babel Media, which specializes in video game localization."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of St Catherine's College, Oxford", "response": ["*Chris Maslanka \u2013 writer and broadcaster"]}]}}
