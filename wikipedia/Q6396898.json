He also won an All Star for his performances in the 2007 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.\nMcCloy plays his club football for Erin's Own's Lavey. As a dual player, he also plays hurling for Lavey, and has in the past also hurled for Derry - winning an Ulster Senior Hurling Championship medal. He is well known for wearing his candystriped stockings above knee level.\nIn football, he is seen as a tough, old-fashioned full back, who is also very competent with the ball in his hands going forward and a good reader of the game. Although full back is his usual position, he has said he prefers to play at centre half back and has done so on occasion for Derry and Lavey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of All Stars Awards winners (football)", "response": ["| FB || 20px|border Kevin McCloy || Derry || 1"]}, {"page": "Lavey GAC", "response": ["* Kevin McCloy \u2013 All Star winner."]}, {"page": "Lavey, County Londonderry", "response": ["*Kevin McCloy - All Star winner and current Derry footballer."]}]}}
