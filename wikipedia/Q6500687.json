He was born at Lincoln and died at Taunton, Somerset.\nKey was a lower-order left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm spin bowler, which was not a useful skill to have in a team dominated by the bowling of Jack White, also slow left-arm. He played in three matches in 1919, making his highest score, 30, in the second of these, against Worcestershire. Four more games followed with less success in 1921 and to the end of that season he had bowled just a single over in first-class cricket. In 1922, however, in the match against Leicestershire at Aylestone Road, Leicester, White was not playing and Key was given 17.1 overs, and took two wickets, the only dismissals of his first-class career. This was, however, his last match in first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Key (surname)", "response": ["*Laurence Key (1895\u20131971), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Laurence Key (1919\u20131922) 8 matches CA"]}]}}
