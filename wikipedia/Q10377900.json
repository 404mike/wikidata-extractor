He spent four years with Oxford, playing close to 200 games, before he was sold on to Portsmouth for \u00a3200,000 in 1993. In six years with \"Pompey\" he made around 200 appearances, before he was loaned out to Blackpool, and then allowed to leave permanently for Carlisle United in 1999. In 2000, he signed with Kidderminster Harriers, before he briefly entered the Welsh football circuit with Rhyl in 2001. Later that year he returned to the Football League with Port Vale, before he joined Conference side Accrington Stanley for a twelve-month spell in May 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Masters Football", "response": ["|  John Durnin (Liverpool)", "|  John Durnin (Liverpool)"]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["Horton's next move was to become assistant to former Brighton teammate Mark Lawrenson, now rookie manager at Second Division Oxford United in May 1988. Lawrenson left the Manor Ground in October 1988 after star player Dean Saunders was sold to Derby County without his consent, and the board elected Horton as his replacement; at the time both Derby and Oxford were owned by members of Robert Maxwell's family. The million pound fee for Saunders allowed Horton to build a squad of his own: former Brighton teammate Steve Foster (Luton Town), Wales international Andy Melville (\u00a3270,000 from Swansea City), New Zealand international Ceri Evans (free agent), defensive midfielder Mickey Lewis (part-exchange to Derby for Trevor Hebberd), Jim Magilton (\u00a3100,000 from Liverpool), John Durnin (\u00a3250,000 from Liverpool), and England under-21 international winger Paul Simpson (\u00a3200,000 from Manchester City). He also gave d\u00e9buts to Joey Beauchamp and Paul Kee. Under his leadership Oxford finished the 1988\u201389 Second Division campaign in 17th-place. In preparation for the 1989\u201390 campaign, he exploited the relationship between Derby and Oxford to sign Dave Penney for \u00a3175,000. On the pitch it was a case of deja-vu, as Oxford finished the season in 17th-place, again with 54 points. Hoping to build a promotion winning squad for the 1990\u201391 campaign, he bought Doncaster Rovers defender Les Robinson for \u00a3150,000.
