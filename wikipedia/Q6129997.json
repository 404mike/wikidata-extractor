Bonwick also reports a number of claims of brutality by sealers towards Aboriginal women including some of those made by Robinson. An Aboriginal woman by the name of Bulrer related her experience to Robinson, that sealers had rushed her camp and stolen six women including herself \"the white men tie them and then they flog them very much, plenty much blood, plenty cry.\" Sealing captain James Kelly wrote in 1816 that the custom of the sealers was to each have \"two to five of these native women for their own use and benefit\". A shortage of women available \"in trade\" resulted in abduction becoming common, and in 1830 it was reported that at least fifty Aboriginal women were \"kept in slavery\" on the Bass Strait islands.H. W. Parker, The Rise, Progress, and Present State of V. D. Land, 1833 ", "Some historians argue that European disease did not appear to be a serious factor until after 1829. Other historians including Geoffrey Blainey and Keith Windschuttle, point to introduced disease as the main cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal population. Keith Windschuttle argues that while smallpox never reached Tasmania, respiratory diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis and the effects of venereal diseases devastated the Tasmanian Aboriginal population whose long isolation from contact with the mainland compromised their resistance to introduced disease. The work of historian James Bonwick and anthropologist H. Ling Roth, both writing in the 19th century, also point to the significant role of epidemics and infertility without clear attribution of the sources of the diseases as having been introduced through contact with Europeans. Bonwick, however, did note that Tasmanian Aboriginal women were infected with venereal diseases by Europeans. Introduced venereal disease not only directly caused deaths but, more insidiously, left a significant percentage of the population unable to reproduce. Josephine Flood, archaeologist, wrote: \"Venereal disease sterilised and chest complaints \u2013 influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis \u2013 killed.\""]}, {"page": "Keith Windschuttle", "response": ["Windschuttle argues that encroaching pastoralism did not cause starvation through the loss of native hunting grounds as some historians have proposed, as their numbers were being drastically reduced by introduced disease,Geoffrey Blainey, \"Native Fiction\", The New Criterion, April 2003. and large parts of Tasmania were not then, or now, occupied by white settlers.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 87\u201395. Windschuttle's estimate of the size of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population at the time of settlement is that it may have been as low as 2,000. Estimates made of the combined population of the Aboriginal people of Tasmania, before European arrival in Tasmania, are generally in the range of 3,000 to 8,000 people. Genetic studies have suggested much higher figures, which is supported by oral traditions that Aboriginal people were \"more numerous than the white people were aware of\" but that their population had been decimated by a sudden outbreak of disease prior to 1803.James Bonwick, Daily Life and Origins of the Tasmanians, Sampson, Low, Son and Marston, London, 1870, p. 84-85. It has been speculated that early contacts with passing ships, exploratory expeditions or sealers before colonization may have caused outbreaks of epidemic disease.Josephine Flood, The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, 2006, pp. 66\u201367. The low rate of genetic drift found in a recent genetic study argues that the highest previous estimate of pre-colonial Aboriginal population (8,000) is likely too low and that a significantly higher population cannot be ruled out. He argues that the evidence shows that what the orthodox historians construed as \"resistance\" by Tasmanian Aboriginal people were acts of theft and violence motivated by their desire for exotic consumer goods like flour, tea, sugar and blankets. The indigenous culture, in his view, \"had no sanctions against the murder of anyone outside their immediate clan\", therefore they had no cultural sanctions preventing the killing of settler outsiders to obtain desired goods or in revenge. The forced removal of Tasmania's Aboriginal people from the Tasmanian mainland to Flinders Island was the Colonial Administration's measure to ensure peace for hard-pressed settlers while attempting, unsuccessfully to prevent the extinction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people. The rapid decline in the Aboriginal population after the British colonisation was the product of the interaction of a number of factors, including introduced diseases causing death and infertility, continued internecine warfare, deaths through conflict with settlers and the loss of a significant number of women of childbearing age from the full-blooded aboriginal gene pool to white sealers and settlers through abduction, \"trade\" and by voluntary association.", "Windschuttle refers to accounts by the French zoologist Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9ron (who is credited with the first use of the term anthropology),Flannery, T.

He notes that the \"murder of women because of insult, jealousy and infidelity, was common\" and that a woman who refused a particular suitor would often be abducted and raped. He argues that this contributed to the willingness of some Aboriginal women to associate themselves with sealers and settlers rather than their own people, so reducing the full-blooded Aboriginal population's ability to reproduce itself. He cites a number of accounts including one published in 1820 by a British officer who had spoken with Aboriginal women living with Bass Strait sealers. The officer reported that Aboriginal women made it known that their (Aboriginal) husbands treat them with \"considerable harshness and tyranny\" and that they sometimes run away and \"attach themselves to the English sailors\", finding \"their situation greatly improved by attaching themselves to the sealing gangs\".Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 379\u2013382. Windschuttle holds that the willingness of some Tasmanian Aboriginal women to engage in prostitution with convicts, sealers and settlers and the Tasmanian Aboriginal men who \"actively colluded\" in the trade in their women aided in the transmission of venereal and other introduced diseases to the indigenous population. Windschuttle argues that introduced disease was the primary cause of the destruction of the full-blooded Tasmanian Aboriginal people, not merely by directly causing deaths but also through widespread infertility resulting from introduced venereal disease.Windschuttle, The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, pp. 372\u2013375, 383\u2013386.", "Within a year Windschuttle's claims and research produced a volume of rebuttal, namely Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History, an anthology edited and introduced by Robert Manne, professor of politics at La Trobe University, with contributions by Australian academics from a range of disciplines. Manne, who called Windschuttle's publication \"one of the most implausible, ignorant and pitiless books about Australian history written for many years\",Manne, \"Windschuttle's Whitewash\", in Craven, p. 66  summed up the case against Windschuttle's book, noting that its assessment of Aboriginal deaths is based on Plomley, despite the fact that Plomley denied that any estimate regarding such deaths could be made from the documentary record. Manne  added further observations, to the effect: that \"a scrupulous conservative scholar\", H. A. Willis, using exactly the same sources as Windschuttle, instead came up with a figure of 188 violent deaths and another 145 rumoured deaths; that Windschuttle's method excludes deaths of Aborigines who were wounded, and later died; that all surviving Aborigines transported by Robinson to Flinders' Island bore marks of violence and gunshot wounds \"perpetrated on them by depraved whites\"; that Windschuttle cannot deny that between 1803 and 1834 almost all Tasmanian Aborigines died, and the only evidence for disease as a factor before 1829 rests on a single conversation recorded by James Bonwick, and that Aboriginal women who lived with sealers did not, however, die off from contact with bearers of foreign disease; that Windschuttle likened Aboriginal attacks on British settlers to \"modern-day junkies raiding service stations for money\", whereas both colonial records and modern historians speak of them as highly \"patriotic\", attached to their lands, and engaged in a veritable war to defend it from settlement; that by Windschuttle's own figures, the violent death rate of Aborigines in Tasmania in the 1820s must have been 360 times the murder rate in contemporary New York; that Windschuttle shows scarce familiarity with period books, citing only 3 of the 30 books published on Van Diemen's land for the period 1803\u20131834, and with one of them confuses the date of the first visit by the French with the publication date of the volume that recounted their expedition; that it is nonsensical to argue that a people who had wandered over an island and survived for 34,000 years had no attachment to their land; that Windschuttle finds no native words in 19th century wordlists for \"land\" to attest to such an attachment, when modern wordlists show 23 entries under \"country\".Robert Manne, \"Windschuttle's Whitewash\", in Peter Craven (ed.), The Best Australian Essays, Black, Inc., 2003, pp. 65\u201377.Also see Robert Manne, \"Keith Windschuttle,\" The Monthly, January 2010; Keith Windschuttle, \"Mind Your Language, Robert,\" Quadrant, May 2010; Windschuttle, \"Robert Manne's Bad Language,\" Quadrant, April 2010.
