He was the son, by his first marriage, of Bartholomew Howlett, a native of Norfolk, who was settled at Louth. Howlett came to London and served as apprentice to James Heath, the engraver.\nHe worked mainly on topographical and antiquarian works. In 1801 he engraved and published A Selection of Views in the County of Lincoln, with seventy-five plates from drawings by Thomas Girtin, John Nash, and others, of which a later edition appeared in 1805. He also executed plates for Wilkinson's Londina Illustrata, Bentham's History of Ely, Frost's Notices of Hull, George Anderson's Plan and Views of the Abbey Royal of St. Denys, the Gentleman's Magazine, and similar works. In 1817 he made a number of drawings for a projected History of Clapham, of which one number only was published.\nWhen the Royal Hospital of St. Katherine, near the Tower of London, was pulled down in 1826, Howlett made a number of drawings, with a view to a publication, which never appeared. He made drawings of about a thousand seals of English monastic and religious houses for the notable antiquary John Caley (d. 1834).\nSubsequently, he fell into financial difficulty, and died at Newington, Surrey (now in Greater London) on 18 December 1827, aged 60.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Gentleman's Magazine", "response": ["* Bartholomew Howlett (1767\u20131827), English draughtsman and engraver"]}, {"page": "Charles Frost (antiquary)", "response": ["Frost studied the handwriting of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and on 2 May 1822 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1827 he published by subscription Notices relative to the Early History of the Town and Port of Hull; .. with illustrations by Bartholomew Howlett. In it he claimed to show that the town commonly attributed to have been founded by Edward I (John Leland, William Camden and others), was expanded from an earlier habitation on the same site, named Wyke, which was separate from the place known as Myton to the west. The work was the subject of a long and flattering critique by Nicholas Harris Nicolas in the Retrospective Review for December 1827."]}, {"page": "Londina Illustrata", "response": ["Most of the plates carry names of the draughtsman and engraver.
