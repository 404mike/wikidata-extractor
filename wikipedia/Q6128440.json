He was educated at Eton College where he played cricket in the Eton XI. He went on to Exeter College, Oxford and played  in the Oxford XI, including the Varsity match against Cambridge in 1848, 1849, and 1850, being captain of the team  in 1850. In 1849 he also rowed in the Oxford boat in the Boat Race. In 1850 he was in the Oxford eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup and the coxed four that won the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.  In 1851 he partnered Joseph William Chitty to win Silver Goblets at Henley.  Aitken was also an athlete and at Oxford won the mile race, came second in the two miles race and was described as favourite at 2 to 1 in the Steeplechese.Aitken was ordained  after leaving the University. In 1853 he played cricket for Harlequins and between 1855 and 1857 played for Gentlemen of Kent teams. In due course, he became the vicar of Chorleywood,  Hertfordshire. It was said that  few of the younger people could hold their own against him at lawn tennis. In 1869 Aitken responded to Dr J Morgan, who was investigating the health effects of rowing.\nYour letter reached me at a most opportune time, as I was in company with my old friend Mr J. Chitty, and we at once discussed the subject of it together; we both agreed that rowing and training had not done us the very slightest harm, and what is more, we could not remember any one of our old Oxford boating friends who had suffered from it. So far from considering training to be dangerous, I believe that most men would be infinitely the better for it.\nAitken died at Hove at the age of 78. His brother Henry Aitken also played cricket for Oxford.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Aitken", "response": ["James Aitken may refer to:", "*James Aitken (bishop) (1612/3\u20131687), Scottish Episcopal bishop", "*James Aitken (footballer) (1882\u20131915), Australian rules footballer", "*James Aitken (priest) (1829\u20131908), Church of England priest and multi-sports player", "*John the Painter (1752\u20131777), also known as James Aitken, Scot who committed acts of terror in British naval dockyards in 1776\u201377"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Exeter College, Oxford", "response": ["* James Aitken (1829\u20131908), clergyman and sportsman, competed in the Varsity cricket match three times and the 1849 Boat Race", "* James Aitken (d 1687), Bishop of Galloway"]}, {"page": "James Aitken (clergyman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Aitken (priest)"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|James Aitken"]}, {"page": "Henry Aitken (cricketer)", "response": ["Born at Hadley Wood, Middlesex, Aitken was the son of James Aitken M.D. He was educated at Eton College, where he captained the college cricket team, and at Exeter College, Oxford.", "He died at Eastbourne, Sussex on 12 August 1915.
