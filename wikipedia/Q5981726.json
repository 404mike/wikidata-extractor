He began playing as a child for Thornbury Town, another of his father's former teams, and initially joined Bristol Rovers as an amateur in 1956, a move which mirrored his older brother David who had also joined Rovers from Thornbury but died in a bungalow fire in Olveston before making any League appearances.\nAfter two years as an amateur, Hamilton became a part-time professional in January 1958, aged 17, and made his first team debut in the 1958\u201359 season. He made eleven League appearances in his first three seasons as a paid player before finally becoming fully professional in December 1961 at the age of 21. He was Bristol Rovers' top goalscorer during the 1964\u201365 season with twenty-one goals, and in all he played 149 League games for the club and scored 60 goals but became plagued by an ongoing knee problem later in his time in Bristol. He had a brief loan spell at Exeter City during the 1967\u201368 season and spent a year with Newport County the following campaign, but his knee trouble forced him to retire from the professional game in 1969.\nHamilton returned to non-League football in 1970, spending two years at Weston-super-Mare and a further two at Welton Rovers from 1972 until 1974, when he returned to Weston as assistant manager. His non-footballing career was spent as an airframe fitter with Rolls-Royce in Patchway, from where he took early retirement in 1994.\nIn his later life Hamilton lived in Rudgeway with his wife Betty and was a cricket and golf fan. He has two children, Stephen and Sarah. Stephen, like his father, is an accomplished sportsman and played senior cricket for a number of clubs in the Bristol area. Ian was a member of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club and has travelled to see England play in locations including Australia, Barbados and South Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Hamilton", "response": ["Ian Hamilton may refer to:", "* Ian Hamilton (British Army officer) (1853\u20131947), British general", "* Ian Hamilton (cricketer) (1906\u20131992), New Zealand cricketer", "* Ian Hamilton (advocate) (born 1925), Scottish lawyer", "* Ian Hamilton (critic) (1938\u20132001), British critic, poet, literary magazine publisher and editor", "* Ian Hamilton (footballer) (1940\u20132021), English footballer who played for Bristol Rovers, Exeter City & Newport County", "* Ian Hamilton (writer) (born 1946), Canadian author of the Ava Lee mystery novel series", "* Ian Hamilton (footballer, born 1950), English footballer, known as \"Chico\"", "* Ian Hamilton (footballer, born 1956), English football midfielder with Darlington, La Louvi\u00e8re and Li\u00e8ge", "* Ian Hamilton (footballer, born 1967), English football midfielder with West Bromwich Albion and Sheffield United", "* Ian Hamilton (baseball) (born 1995), baseball player", "* Abigail Austen (born 1964), previously known as Ian Hamilton, a transsexual woman and the first officer in the British Army to complete gender reassignment"]}, {"page": "Ian Hamilton (footballer born 1940)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Hamilton (footballer, born 1940)"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 in English football", "response": ["* 26 April 2021: Ian Hamilton, 80, Bristol Rovers and Newport County inside forward.https://www.twitter.com/Official_BRFC/status/1387082821051817988, Ian Hamilton death, Bristol Rovers F.C., 27 April 2021"]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Ian Hamilton, professional footballer (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2021", "response": ["*Ian Hamilton, 80, English footballer (Bristol Rovers).The obituary notice of Ian Hamilton"]}]}}
