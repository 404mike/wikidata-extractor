He was a formative figure in the band, playing with them from 1978 to early 1979. He departed after a tour supporting the Buzzcocks. During his time with the band only two unreleased studio demos were made, while the rest of the group's repertoire were recorded and released with Kadmon's replacement, Ian Devine.\nBy the time he left Ludus, he recorded with Mike Ellis of hard rock band Aragorn.By 1980, Kadmon resurfaced joining the Distractions, although the group disbanded the following year.\nAfter the Distractions split, Kadmon played with the Fall, although only on the \"Hard Life in Country\" song for the Room to Live album. The group's frontman Mark E. Smith admired Kadmon, calling him to collaborate, but he disappointed shortly after, although Smith continued to consider Kadmon as a genius and \"one of the great people in Manchester who never got anywhere\". On the album he was erroneously credited as Arthur Cadman.\nHe reappeared in 1987 alongside Deborah Shure in a new band, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which released one single, \"High Heels\".\nHe suffered a stroke in June 2013, and continues to perform as a speaker, guitar player and songwriter. He wrote a diary of his stroke and recovery, noting he is improving his mobility in his right leg, arm and hand.In 2014 as Pieter Egriega, he was awarded the UK Stroke Association's Award for Creative Arts.  Following this award he then began writing Fringe Arts Shows, first with Cupid Stunts and Plenty of Fish at Manchester Comedy Fringe Festival in 2015, and then winning the Best Small Group/Ensemble Award at the 2016 Buxton Fringe Festival for Extraordinary People Ordinary Lives.In 2017, he created a new way to showcase his songs with a show again at Buxton Fringe Festival called Mr Different, which prompted several positive reviews.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ludus (band)", "response": ["The band was founded by Linder Sterling, who in the arts and music scene is credited as Linder, having designed the cover of Buzzcocks' single \"Orgasm Addict\" and Magazine's debut album Real Life; and Arthur Kadmon, formerly of Manicured Noise. Shortly after the formation, ex-Nosebleeds drummer Philip \"Toby\" Tomanov and bassist Willie Trotter joined to complete the band. It debuted live at the Factory Club, supporting The Pop Group, in October 1978, recording a studio demo the same month. The following month, Ludus played shows at well-known 'punk' venues like Eric's Club in Liverpool and, travelling with Magazine, The Venue in London."]}, {"page": "Room to Live", "response": ["The group had originally entered the studio to record a single, but Mark E. Smith prevailed upon them to record more songs, all of which were new to the band and had not previously been rehearsed or performed live.Thompson, Dave (2003) A User's Guide to the Fall, Helter Skelter Publishing , pp. 63\u201364 In accordance with this experimental approach, members were deliberately excluded from certain tracks. Smith also stated of the songs that \"some of them are just me and Karl double-tracked\" Whilst these remarks resulted in considerable conjecture among fans, the exact lineups for each track have never been properly confirmed. In a letter to City Life magazine in April 1984, Smith noted that Riley only played on two tracks on Room to Live, and in 2008 Riley confirmed via his BBC6 radio show that he did not appear on all tracks. In his book \"The Big Midweek\", Steve Hanley states that \"Marquis Cha-Cha\" was recorded by a trio of himself, Burns and Smith and also confirms the role of Arthur Kadmon (from Ludus and credited as \"Cadman\") in the recording of \"Hard Life in Country\" at a session to which neither Craig Scanlon nor Marc Riley were invited. Hanley's version, however, appears to refute the much-rumoured story, as relayed by Mick Middles in his book \"The Fall\" (co-authored with Mark E Smith), that suggested that Kadmon recorded approximately sixteen seconds of guitar and was then dismissed. Drummer Paul Hanley described the recording of the album as \"a fucking nightmare. You'd turn up and find Smith had only invited half the band, or brought in other musicians without telling anyone!\".\"INTERVIEW! in depth interview with drummer Paul Hanley on his days in the Fall\", Louder Than War, 3 December 2016.
