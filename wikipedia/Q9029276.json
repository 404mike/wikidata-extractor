NPR Music. Retrieved 19 July 2016. Sketches from an Island 2 is a balearic downtempo record with more of a \"relaxed mood\" than its predecessor, according to Resident Advisor. The Ibiza island concept is also symbolized by what Pitchfork critic Andy Beta described as the album's \"beautiful, spare melodicism\". He wrote that \"Forgotten Island\" and \"One Slow Thought\", the album's final two cuts, were the most \"evocative\" works in Barrott's discography to date. He analyzed that \"Over at Dieter's Place\" uses instruments and sounds such as a pedal steel guitar, a mbira, birdcall, woodwinds, and a hand drum to \"render\" Ibiza's \"bucolic miniatures\" that Cluster, a group that musician Dieter Moebius was a part of, emulated in their works.", "All tracks written and produced by Mark Barrott, mixed by Lopazz and mastered by Lewis Hopkins.
