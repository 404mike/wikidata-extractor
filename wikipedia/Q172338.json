He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, the 1975 British Grand Prix in which, like several others, he crashed during a storm in the closing laps.  He was classified 18th and thus scored no championship points.\nPrior to his single grand prix entry, Morgan raced a Mini in the mid-1960s, and soon moved on to Formula Three. He incurred a 12-month ban for dangerous driving at the end of 1970, after a last corner collision with James Hunt at Crystal Palace, but was subsequently allowed to progress to Formula Atlantic in 1971. This was followed by two seasons in Formula Two, then a return to Formula Atlantic. After his one Grand Prix, he retired from racing until returning in the British Saloon Car Championship in 1980\u20131981, driving a Colt Lancer.
