Cayley's paper, published in 1809\u20131810, discussed Garnerin's jump at some length. Garnerin had used an umbrella-shaped parachute which had swayed excessively from side-to-side during the descent; Cayley theorised that a cone-shaped parachute would be more stable. Cocking  spent many years developing his improved parachute, based on Cayley's design, which consisted of an inverted cone 107 feet (32.61\u00a0m) in circumference connected by three hoops.
