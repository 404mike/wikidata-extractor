He experimented with coal gas as a cheaper and more readily available alternative to hydrogen for lifting power. His first ascent was in a coal gas balloon on 19 July 1821. He became a professional balloonist and had made 200 ascents by 1835. In 1836, he set a major long distance record in the balloon Royal Vauxhall, flying overnight from Vauxhall Gardens in London to Weilburg, Duchy of Nassau (Germany) a distance of 480 miles (770 km). By the time he retired in 1852, he had flown in a balloon more than 500 times.Green is credited with the invention of the trail rope as an aid to steering and landing a balloon.A trophy named after him, the \"Charles Green Salver\", is awarded by the British Balloon and Airship Club (BBAC) for exceptional flying achievements or contributions in ballooning. The trophy was originally given to Green by Richard Crawshay after a ballon trip in Norfolk. Recipients have included Brian Jones and Bertrand Piccard for the first round-the-world balloon flight. Green was included in the ballooning hall of fame in 1999.", "link_mentions": {}}}
