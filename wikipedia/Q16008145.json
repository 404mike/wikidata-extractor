He at once collected all available men and charged the nearest group of guns and in spite of being wounded, gained the trench, personally disposing of two machine-guns and inflicting many casualties. Notwithstanding a second wound he then climbed out of the trench to fix his position and locate the enemy, then ordered his men to cut their way back to the battalion, which they did. He was again wounded, very seriously.He later became a surgeon at Leicester Royal Infirmary and achieved the rank of colonel after serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps in World War II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| John Cridlan Barrett || British Army || 1918 || First World War || Pontruet"]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire", "response": ["*John Cridlan Barrett"]}, {"page": "John Barrett", "response": ["* John Cridlan Barrett (1897\u20131977), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Royal Leicestershire Regiment", "response": ["*Lieutenant John Cridlan Barrett, First World War (24 September 1918)"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (J)", "response": ["# John Cridlan Barrett"]}, {"page": "Arnold Lodge School", "response": ["*John Cridlan Barrett, Recipient of the Victoria Cross \"for most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty\" on 24 September 1918"]}, {"page": "List of works by Terence Cuneo", "response": ["|1958||Lieutenant John Cridlan Barrett, VC, 1/5th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment during the Attack on Machine Guns in Forgan's Trench, 24 September 1918, oil on canvas ||view ||135 \u00d7 160\u00a0cm.
