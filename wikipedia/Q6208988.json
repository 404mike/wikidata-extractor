A triple save was particularly impressive, firstly from a near post header. Then again from the corner and the resulting drive from outside the box forced Gallacher into a super reaction save as he only saw it late. Dunfermline's only threat going forward was from set-pieces where Hardie went close from a free-kick and a corner. But late on a mazy run from Joe Cardle was crossed low back to the edge of the area, where Paul Burns's well taken shot was driven into the net. Final Score:1\u20130</", "Both teams went into this match after an excellent start to the season, both surpassing expectations. From the start the visitors looked like they would get goals with Dunfermline's defence being torn apart, especially by a lively Chris Humphrey. The breakthrough finally came when Keith Lasley and Michael Higdon combined with Higdon curling in from the edge of the area. Tom Hateley nearly made it two a few minutes later with a free-kick hitting the post. But it was only a short respite for Dunfermline as Motherwell scored again, Jamie Murphy strolled past Gary Mason and was given time to hit a 20-yard shot which heavily deflected off Alex Keddie and into the net. In the second half things hadn't changed with Motherwell dominating and when Chris Humphrey was allowed to cut inside into the box his shot clipped the post and into the net. Dunfermline then started to attack, pushing Motherwell back, and were rewarded when David Graham's 25-yard shot flicked off Joe Cardle and into the net, with Cardle claiming the goal. Cardle then bagged another as he cut into the box and his shot deflected off Stephen Craigan and past the helpless keeper. With two minutes to go Dunfermline pushed forward, but were counter-attacked and Higdon's late finish from a cross by Nicky Law finished the game. Final Score:2\u20134</", "Dunfermline's first game after the international break started well with Jason Thomson scoring his first professional goal after the ball ricocheted off him from a corner. At this point, Dunfermline were on top even though manager Jim McIntyre had been sent to the stands by the referee early on. Alex Keddie then brought down James Dayton in the box, and the resulting penalty was converted by Paul Heffernan. He then doubled his goal tally when an incisive ball through the defence from Dean Shiels was finished by the striker. Straight after half-time Dunfermline hit back with Ryan Thomson heading home Joe Cardle's cross. However Zdenek Kroca calmly slotted a finish in after being given time in the box, putting the home side back in the lead. Late on Andy Kirk thought he had equalised but was correctly ruled offside. Final score: 2\u20133</", "The home side could have been three up within the first half an hour with Kirk, Jason Thomson and Alex Keddie all putting chances wide. Dunfermline were controlling the game until, against the run off play, Hibs scored. A throw-in on the right, just inside Dunfermline's half, was flicked on to Ivan Sproule, who walked through some poor defending to easily slot home. Hibs then took charge of the game and Paul Gallacher had to make a super one-on-one save from Garry O'Connor. However, in the second half O'Connor's shot, after being allowed to turn by Austin McCann, deflected off Keddie and past the hapless Gallacher. Dunfermline then attacked and were rewarded under two minutes later after Ryan Thomson powered through the Hibs team and finished well. A Joe Cardle drive was then parried out to J. Thomson who scuffed his shot off Paul Hanlon and into the net. Dunfermline nearly won the game with attempts from Cardle, Andrew Barrowman and the impressive David Graham, all not finding the goal. Final Score:2\u20132</", "An early Paul Burns strike curled against the inside of the post and trickled along the line, somehow staying out of the goal. Dunfermline proceeded to dominate as John Potter and Joe Cardle had shot saved by the keeper Ryan Esson. A slip by Alex Keddie then let Richie Foran past him and his cross was met by a flying header from ex-Raith Rovers player Gregory Tade. However, in the second half, the Pars continued to threaten and Andy Kirk hooked a shot over before Inverness immediately responded with a 25-yard Greg Tansey free-kick that flew a foot wide. Liam Buchanan was then brought down in the box by David Proctor, and he stepped up to take the penalty himself, calmly slotting home to equalise. Right at the end, Shane Sutherland had an effort well saved by the keeper to keep the score level. Final score 1\u20131</", "From the very start the home side dominated with several chances in the first half. Jim Goodwin's low shot from 30 yards was parried away by Paul Gallacher, then a few minutes later a driven shot came back off Paul Burns in the penalty box which brought appeals for a penalty, but were waved away by the ref. Shortly after, a free-kick was trapped under Burns as he tried to clear and another shout for a penalty came, but once again were ignored. Gallacher was forced into more saves, but the pressure told as Nigel Hasselbaink burst through the defence as Gallacher narrowed the angle, he squared across the goal mouth to Kenny McLean, who tapped in from a yard out. Stephen Thompson then had too efforts magnificently saved by Gallacher as St Mirren pushed for a second. Dunfermline then had their first proper chance with a superb Paul Willis cross met by Ryan Thomson who headed just wide. Austin McCann took too much time on the ball and was punished when he lost possession to Stephen Thompson and his pass to Hasselbaink was smashed into the net. After half time to game calmed down, with less chances for either side. Joe Cardle came off the bench and made an immediate impact. His cross evaded everyone and came back off the post only to strike Saints keeper Craig Samson and roll into the net. Cardle then nearly equalised with a drive which was well saved by Samson. However, the home side comfortably held onto their position till the end of the game. Final Score 1\u20132</", "An already hard task away at one of the Old Firm was made harder in just over 5 minutes, when Paul Willis played a backwards pass straight to Gary Hooper who took two touches into the box and fired home across the box into the bottom left hand corner. Alex Keddie then gave the ball away on the half-way line and Jamie Forrest, Hooper and Kris Commons combined to switch the ball across to the left hand side to Anthony Stokes. He drove low at goal and Paul Gallacher's parry reached Hooper who flicked it backwards to Forrest, who smashed in into the roof of the net. A long range drive from Biram Kayal was then saved by Gallacher's stretched leg. Dunfermline then had a penalty appeal turned away after Daniel Majstorovi\u0107 climbed over the back off Ryan Thomson. Celtic continued to look for a second and Gallacher and Keddie combined to keep out Commons after a low cross from the left by Stokes. Stokes then somehow missed from two yards out, mistiming his back post volley. In the second half Paul Burns felled Forrest in the box, to give away a penalty. Ki then sent Gallacher the wrong way, but hit the outside of the post, from the spot. Stokes then missed a one-on-one chance, hitting the post again. Joe Cardle went close for the Pars, cutting inside from the left forcing Fraser Forster into a good low save. He then made another as Liam Buchanan was sent through, but the keep was out fast to block the attempted chip. David Graham then laid off Andrew Barrowman in the right hand corner of the box, and his low drive across goal found the net.
