He studied successively at the Edinburgh Academy, the Prairie College in Alberta, New College at the University of Edinburgh, St. John's College at the University of Durham, the University of Aberdeen, and McMaster University. He then taught at Carleton University, McMaster University, and the University of Calgary. He died as the result of a car crash in 1985.\nCraigie wrote commentaries on Deuteronomy, Ezekiel, the Twelve Prophets, and Psalms 1 \u2013 50. He referred to his approach as \"theological-historical\" or \"theological-scientific\". Lyle Eslinger notes that Cragie's approach was \"a melding of conservative theological interests and assumptions with the scientific methods of biblical criticism.\" Tremper Longman describes him as being \"among the best of recent evangelical interpreters\" as well as \"an astute theologian and philologist\".In 1988, a Festschrift was published in his honour. Ascribe to the Lord: Biblical and Other Studies in Memory of Peter C. Craigie included contributions from R. K. Harrison, Kenneth Kitchen, Alan Millard, and Robert Polzin. The Canadian Society of Biblical Studies sponsors the biannual Craigie Lecture in his memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prairie College", "response": ["* Peter Craigie: Old Testament Scholar, Author, Dean of Humanities Faculty and V.P.

J. Kissane's proposal of an original text \u05db\u05dc\u05d5, \u201cconsumed\u201d, changed to \u05db\u05e8\u05d5 (noting the occasional interchange of \u05dc and \u05e8), with the nuance \"my hands and my feet were exhausted\".Peter Craigie. Word Biblical Commentary: Psalms 1\u201350. Word, Incorporated, 1983. . Pages 195\u20136. Gregory Vall proposes that the text originally read \u05d0\u05e1\u05e8\u05d5 (\u2019asaru), which means \u201cthey have bound\u201d before \u05e1 and \u05d0 got inadvertently swapped, resulting in the meaningless \u05e1\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5, which was later changed into \u05db\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 (ka'aru); this could explain why Aquila of Sinope, Symmachus, and Jerome all translated it the word as \u201cto bind\u201d."]}, {"page": "Psalm 44", "response": ["Usually, the Psalm is organized as follows:Gianfranco Ravasi, Il libro dei Salmi, volume I, Bologna 1981, p. 782Erich Zenger: Die Psalmen I.
