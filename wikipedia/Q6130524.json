A grant was unusual because at the time the whole cost of war memorials was usually met by public subscription.  Herman Cawthra was selected as sculptor.  He worked on the design of the memorial with Hubert Ernest Bulmer, a member of the committee and art director for the borough.  Some of Cawthra's models were exhibited at the Royal Academy before they were placed on the memorial.  The figures were made in the foundry of M.\u00a0Manenti, and the stonework was built by Henry A.\u00a0Clegg and Sons of Chester.  The memorial was unveiled on 15\u00a0October 1922 by Major James Burnie in the presence of a large crowd.
