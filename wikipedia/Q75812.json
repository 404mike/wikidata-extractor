Modern eaters, according to No\u00eblie Vialles, demand an \"ellipsis\" between meat and dead animals; for instance, calves' eyes are no longer considered a delicacy as in the Middle Ages, but provoke disgust. Even in the English language, distinctions emerged between animals and their meat, such as between cattle and beef, pigs and pork.

Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is \"desperatingly undifferentiated\", and Foucault's thesis of a \"disciplinary society\" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy.Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte, p. 81.  In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's \"francocentrism\" because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like Max Weber and Norbert Elias. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is \"because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism\".Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte, p. 91.
