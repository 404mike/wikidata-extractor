He uses the club as a cover for his criminal business. Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha), George's daughter, takes over the control of the club when he leaves; she renames the club \"The Market Cellar\". Annie later sells the club to Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who renames it \"e20\". Under Steve's ownership, Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) is killed in the club after a struggle with Steve and Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom). Beppe di Marco (Michael Greco) and Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) buy the club from Steve, although Beppe sells his majority share to Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), who rebrands the club \"Angie's Den\", in memory of her parents Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Following a refurbishment, Den buys into the business and co-owns with Sharon. They sell the club to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray), who renames it \"Scarlet\" after his deceased daughter. Johnny gives the club to his surviving daughter, Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton), when he is imprisoned. The start of Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) and Bradley Branning's (Charlie Clements) relationship begins in Scarlet when Bradley is falsely blamed for spiking Stacey's drink. A reporter from Inside Soap labelled the moment \"a rather unromantic start to Stacey and Bradders' love story!\" Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) buy the club, renaming it the \"R&R\" - the initials of Ronnie and her sister, Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons). Ronnie and Roxy run the club, while Jack operates as a silent partner. When Ronnie and Jack separate, Ronnie sells her share of the club to Jack, although after a fire in the club, Ronnie and Roxy each buy a share in the club. When Billy tries to woo Carol Jackson (Lindsay Coulson), Carol's daughter Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) becomes aggressive and creates an argument between them, Stacey, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace). An Inside Soap columnist labelled the argument \"one of our favourite catfights\". Jack is later shot at the club by gang member Kylie (Elarica Gallacher), and a few months later, he sells his share of the club to Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Roxy and Ronnie also sell their shares to Janine. Upon her return to Walford, Sharon becomes the R&R's bar manager and she holds her wedding to Jack at the club. At the altar, Jack jilts Sharon, leaving her saddened. Sharon is also offered a small share in the business by Phil. Janine and Sharon later sell their shares to Phil, leaving him as the sole owner. The R&R closes at some point in before Christmas 2016, and remains shut until February 2018, when Sharon decides to reopen it with Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) as the manager. Mel plans to rename the club \"The Phoenix\", but her son Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) sabotages the refurbishment and rebrands it e20 again in honour of his father, Steve. When Mel's ex-husband Ray Kelly (Sean Mahon) plans to remarry her, he buys Phil's 50% stake in E20 and gifts it to Mel as a wedding present.

Moriarty has described his character's original outline as given to him by the production crew when he accepted the role: \"The man\u2019s background, as it was explained in the prepared bio which I received, was pretty nasty. He was a violent man-very bad news. He murdered people. He\u2019d been this vicious boxer who punched and clawed his way up the ladder, disposing of a body here and there over the years if it helped him get to where he wanted to go. He wasn\u2019t just into fencing stolen goods, you know! He was really meant to be this hard, ruthless bastard.\"  However, as Moriarty has inferred, his character altered somewhat from the original outline following the development of his relationship with the soap's matriarch Peggy Mitchell, played by Barbara Windsor: \"Obviously the character evolved in a certain way as the writers wanted to pursue the idea of George being a love interest for one of their important leading ladies. They simply wouldn\u2019t allow her to be involved with a cold-blooded murderer because that wouldn\u2019t reflect well in her character. Besides, inevitable comparisons would have then been drawn between Peggy and George on EastEnders, and Barbara having been married in real life to a gangster, Ronnie Knight.\" Despite this, as author Kate Lock has suggested, \"George Palmer's name carried serious clout in the criminal underworld\" and it was these dalliances in illegal activity that eventually ended George and Peggy's romance. Moriarty has been asked about Peggy's negative reaction to George's criminality because, as the interviewer noted, Peggy's backstory consists of a first marriage to a suggested gangster, Eric Mitchell, and Peggy had accepted his dealings and turned a blind-eye. Moriarty responded, \"I suppose [Peggy being] made landlady [of the soap's pub] did that to her - airs and graces! But that\u2019s what happens on soaps if you stay a long-term character. You\u2019ve got to be made sympathetic and even moral to an extent. So they had Peggy and George being all right for a while, and then George would inevitably screw up and they\u2019d make up again - over and over. Barbara turned to me one night as we were driving home and said, 'This is getting to be bloody boring now, isn\u2019t it?' She wasn\u2019t half right. Quite frankly, the show didn\u2019t know what to make of George. That\u2019s why they brought on [his daughter] Annie [Nadia Sawalha] - to do the dirty work for him! That\u2019s actually quite accurate of the East End villain these days.
