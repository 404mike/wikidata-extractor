Dean Beckwith put Hereford ahead before JJ Melligan and Adam Boyd gave Orient the win. Orient then continued the season with multiple poor results and performances throughout September and October and their only wins were away matches against Walsall and Southend United in the Football League Trophy first round. However Orient were knocked out of the trophy in the following round in an away match at Brighton & Hove Albion. They were in 22nd position in the League One table. Orient booked a place in the second round of the FA Cup after beating Colchester United 1\u20130. Two Goals from Jason Demetriou and Danny Granville in a 1\u20132 away victory against Bradford City put Orient through to the third round of the FA Cup where they played Sheffield United at home. They lost 4\u20131 and, after a run of bad form in the league, Orient parted company with manager Martin Ling and assistant Dean Smith. Youth team manager Kevin Nugent was named caretaker manager overseeing three games. On 5 February 2009 Geraint Williams was announced as manager until the end of the season. He enjoyed a very positive start, winning seven of his first nine matches and moving Orient up to 15th. After Geraint Williams' positive influence on the team they secured their League One status on 13 April with a 1\u20130 win over Swindon Town at the County Ground and eventually finished the season in 14th place."]}, {"page": "Tom Webb", "response": ["In February 2008, Webb was sent on loan for one month to Folkestone Invicta.

After making 14 appearances, Elokobi handed in a transfer request in November 2007, stating that he had no intention of re-signing for the club once his contract expired in the summer of 2008. With the club yet to receive an offer for the player, he made his first start since handing in his transfer request on 1 December. He scored what would prove to be the decisive goal and his final Colchester goal in the 2\u20131 win against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. Following the game, Elokobi insisted that he would \"give 100 per cent for the club\" while still with Colchester.

Graham had added to his squad, signing defender Danny Granville and Dutch striker Clyde Winjard. After just 4 games Leeds went to top of the Premiership for the first time in their history. But rumours began to spread of George Graham taking the Tottenham job after Spurs had sacked Christian Gross, the saga dragged on when finally after a UEFA cup game against Maritimo of Portugal, Graham indeed left Leeds for Tottenham. Graham's assistant David O'Leary took charge as Leeds attempted to court Leicester boss Martin O'Neil, who eventually refused. But United's performances on the pitch began improving -despite only drawing several games, many teenage players were given debuts by O'Leary and put in great performances, such as the game against Italian giants Roma in the UEFA cup (although Leeds were knocked out). Needless to say, O'Leary was appointed manager in time for the game against Derby which ended 2\u20132. Leeds then began winning regularly, playing impressive attacking football. They had several talented youngsters, including goal keeper Paul Robinson, defenders Ian Harte and Johnathan Woodgate, mid fielders Lee Bowyer (who was signed from Charlton 2 seasons before) and Stephen McPhail, as well as strikers Alan Smith and Harry Kewell. But David O'Leary was eager to bring in experienced players to add to this young team, and signed David Batty from Newcastle. Batty was a key player in the Leeds side that won the old Division 1 title in 1992 and a fan favourite. In the run up to Christmas, Leeds were almost in contention for a shot at the title, but suffered back to back losses against Southampton and Newcastle in the new year. This ended any league-winning hopes, and they were also knocked out of the FA cup. Despite this, Leeds ended the season in red hot form, setting a record of 7 straight wins and a 1\u20130 victory over Arsenal, costing the gunners the title race. Leeds finished an impressive 4th place in the league \u2013 their highest finish yet. With this achievement, and with one of the most exiting young squads in the country, the future certainly looked bright for United.", "|Danny Granville"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Danny Granville"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|2||Danny Granville||FB||||Islington||||0||0|| Crystal Palace||9 July 2007||Free transfer", "|Danny Granville", "|align=\"left\"|Danny Granville", "|Danny Granville"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["*  Danny Granville \u2013  Norwich City, October, loan"]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.\u2013Leeds United F.C. rivalry", "response": ["|Danny Granville"]}]}}
