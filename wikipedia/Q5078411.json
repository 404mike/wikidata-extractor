He was a Senior Partner in the firm of Shaw Wallace & Co of India and Ceylon and of R. G. Shaw & Co of London. \nHe became associated with the Burmah Oil Company, and later joined forces with William Knox D'Arcy, of the Mount Morgan Mining Company, in developing the oil concessions d'Arcy had won from the Persian government. Together, and with capital from the British Government, they founded the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which made the Empire largely independent of other powers in the supply of petroleum, which had become of vital strategic importance. He resisted post-War pressure to privatize the company, to the great benefit of the Treasury.Greenway was created Baronet of Wenhaston in the County of Suffolk, in 1919, and in 1927 retired as chairman of Anglo-Persian Oil, and in recognition of his service to the nation was raised to the peerage as Baron Greenway, of Stanbridge Earls in the County of Southampton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baron Greenway", "response": ["*Charles Greenway, 1st Baron Greenway (1857\u20131934)"]}, {"page": "Charles Greenway", "response": ["#Redirect Charles Greenway, 1st Baron Greenway"]}, {"page": "Greenway (surname)", "response": ["*Charles Greenway, 1st Baron Greenway (1857-1934), British businessman"]}]}}
