This relationship with the Heideggerian term was chosen over the Nietzschean term \"demolition,\" as Derrida shared Heidegger's interest in renovating philosophy. Among the questions asked in these essays are \"What is 'meaning', what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric 'voice' as a value of presence, presence of the object, presence of meaning to consciousness, self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness?\" In another essay in Writing and Difference entitled \"Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas\", the roots of another major theme in Derrida's thought emerge: the Other as opposed to the SameDerrida, J.
