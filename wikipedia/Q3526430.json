Wisden commented that \"it is certain that such a piece of folly will never be perpetrated again\" but the cause was rivalry between clubs in Melbourne and Sydney, who both wanted to promote an English team; and Wisden recorded that the Melbourne venture returned a significant loss of revenue. The team backed by the Sydney-based group was composed mainly of professionals under the management of Arthur Shrewsbury and called A. Shrewsbury's XI although it was captained on the field by one of its amateur members, usually C. Aubrey Smith.

He took 36\u00a0wickets that season, finishing with an average of 6.77\u00a0runs per wicket; the best in the club, beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler Fred Spofforth. He made his first-class cricket debut for Victoria that same season, selected to play against a touring English XI led by Middlesex batsman George Vernon. His first match for Victoria against Australian opposition was against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Two months later, he played his first inter-colonial match, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Batting, he scored 54\u00a0runs; his innings included a memorable hit over the leg side boundary from the bowling of leading Test all-rounder George Giffen, and he captured seven wickets for the match with his bowling.  In 1886\u201387, Trott hit a double century for South Melbourne in a match against St Kilda and appeared for Victoria against Alfred Shaw's touring English team, claiming four wickets for 125 runs (4/125).  During the next summer, he played for a non-representative \"Australian XI\" against Arthur Shrewsbury's XI and George Vernon's XI, two English teams touring Australia simultaneously. His chances for inclusion in the Australian squad for the forthcoming tour of England were enhanced when a number of leading players made themselves unavailable.Harte (2003), p 154. However, Trott's batting credentials were modest: he had scored only one half-century in 29 first-class innings. At this point, Trott had enjoyed more success with his bowling. Prior to the Australian team departing for England, a change to the leg before wicket (LBW) law that would aid bowlers of Trott's style seemed imminent. The former Australian player Tom Horan wrote: \"There is no bowler in England who has such a fast leg-break, and on a fine, firm pitch many a batsman has saved his wicket by his legs or body in opposing Trott's deliveries.\"Horan (1989), pp. 128\u2013129."]}, {"page": "Hylton Philipson", "response": ["Throughout his career, Philipson was competing for the wicket-keeper's spot in the English Test side with Gregor MacGregor, which resulted in him playing in only five Test matches for England, which he did on the 1891/92 and 1894/95 tours of Australia.

In 1911-12, there was the first visit by an England Test team organised by MCC. Again, it was a case of using Colombo as a stopover en route to Australia. This team was led by Pelham Warner and played a match against a Ceylon XI which at that time was not a first-class team.

Vernon's team was a strong one. One of the bigger matches of the tour was at Melbourne Cricket Ground against an Australian XI which contained 10 Test players: Vernon's XI won by an innings and Newton, one of only three non-Test players in his team, made 77, starting a revival in his team's single innings after the first six wickets had fallen for 51 runs to a final total of 292.

Another wicket fell to Boyle in the next over and MCC were 5\u20132 but, with Hornby and Arthur Ridley seemingly settling in, they pushed the total on to 27. Then there was a change of bowling and Spofforth came on instead of Allan. Spofforth's first spell at Lord's was \"truly demonic\". Within another 11 overs, MCC were all out, Spofforth taking 6\u20134 in just 5.3 overs including a hat-trick with the wickets of George Hearne, Alfred Shaw and George Vernon. Shaw and Morley took five wickets apiece as they dismissed the Australians for 41 but Gregory decided to open his second innings attack with Spofforth and Boyle. The decisive moment was Spofforth's second ball to Grace, which clean bowled him for 0. The MCC innings lasted just 50 minutes, Boyle taking 6\u20133 and Spofforth 4\u201316. As news of the proceedings spread, the crowd grew in the afternoon sunshine and they \"mobbed the Australians as they left the field in a spirit of non-partisan enthusiasm\".Rae, pp. 220\u2013221.

In the 20th century, there were cases of amateur players being given a nominal job, such as county club assistant secretary.

One MCC match in 1895, against Essex, was his second and final first-class game: he scored 8 and 4 in a low-scoring match that was over inside two days. Later he appeared in the Minor Counties Championship for Northumberland from 1900 to 1902. In late 1913, aged 48, Greenway captained the Incogniti team on a tour of North America.
