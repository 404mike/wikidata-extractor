The 1968\u20131976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV. Their second and most commercially successful line-up consisted of Ian Gillan (vocals) and Roger Glover (bass), who joined founder members Jon Lord (keyboards), Ian Paice (drums) and Ritchie Blackmore (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973 and was revived from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including Rod Evans (lead vocals) and Nick Simper (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 with the line-up including David Coverdale (lead vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass, vocals) (and Tommy Bolin replacing Blackmore in 1975), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including Joe Lynn Turner (vocals). The band's line-up (currently including Ian Gillan, and guitarist Steve Morse from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although keyboardist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by Don Airey) left Ian Paice as the last original Deep Purple member still in the band.", "The first recruit to the band was classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord, Curtis's flatmate, who had most notably played with the Artwoods (led by Art Wood, brother of future Faces and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and including Keef Hartley).Eder, Bruce.

(Simper had previously been in Johnny Kidd and the Pirates, and survived the 1966 car crash that killed Kidd.) Lord alerted the two that he had been recruited for the Roundabout project, after which Simper and Little suggested guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whom Lord had never met. Simper had known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.Thompson, Dave (2004). \"Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story\" p.5. ECW Press", "HEC persuaded Blackmore to travel in from Hamburg to audition for the new group. He was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of the Outlaws, Screaming Lord Sutch, and Neil Christian, the latter artist prompting Blackmore's move to Germany. Curtis's erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fuelled by his use of LSD, caused him to display a sudden lack of interest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. However, HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought and persuaded Ritchie to return from Hamburg a second time. Lord and Blackmore began the recruitment of additional members, retaining Tony Edwards as their manager.Thompson, Dave. Chris Curtis Biography Allmusic. Retrieved 12 December 2011 Lord convinced Nick Simper to join on bass, but Blackmore insisted they leave Carlo Little behind in favour of drummer Bobby Woodman. Woodman was the former drummer for Vince Taylor's Play-Boys (for whom he had played under the name Bobbie Clarke). The initial line-up of Deep Purple started in Cadogan Gardens in South Kensington. ", "In search of a replacement vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer Terry Reid. Though he found the offer \"flattering\", Reid was still bound by an exclusive recording contract with his producer Mickie Most and more interested in his solo career. Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band sought out singer Ian Gillan from Episode Six, a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving any great commercial success. Six's drummer Mick Underwood \u2013 an old comrade of Blackmore's from his days in the Outlaws \u2013 introduced the band to Gillan and bassist Roger Glover. According to Nick Simper, \"Gillan would join only with Roger Glover.\" This effectively killed Episode Six, which gave Underwood a persistent feeling of guilt that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for his new post-Purple band in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Roger was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.", "This created the Deep Purple Mark II line-up, whose first release was a Roger Greenaway-Roger Cook tune titled \"Hallelujah\". At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band and had called John Coletta to inquire about the recording dates for the song. He then found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced. Despite television appearances to promote the \"Hallelujah\" single in the UK, the song flopped. Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper Record Mirror that the band \"need to have a commercial record in Britain\", and described the song as \"an in-between sort of thing\"\u2014a compromise between the type of material the band would normally record, and openly commercial material.Bloom, Jerry (2008). \"Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore\" p.128.

During the tour, Deep Purple showed a remarkable progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier and louder sound than before. Doubts about the compatibility of vocalist Rod Evans with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision to search for a substitute, which was found in Ian Gillan of the band Episode Six. Gillan had formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist Roger Glover, who was also invited to join Deep Purple and replace Nick Simper.

The pressure of the multiple engagements left the band very little time for composition and most of the tracks were written and rehearsed in the studio.Popoff: p.36 Deep Purple was the band's third album to be recorded, even though they had been together for less than one year. According to Nick Simper: \"Recording was always a problem. We were always short of material, purely because of our schedule. The fact that we were always being chased by Tetragrammaton for material, we never had the luxury like most bands do now of saying, 'hang on fellas, we need a little bit of down time to just think about stuff and try and be creative.'\" Added Blackmore: \"That really bugs me...going to the studio, 'right, you gotta turn out an LP, boys.' You know, 'here we go, you gotta write a song...today.' It\u2019s just ridiculous.\"", "Lord had been the main writer on the first two albums and his classical music upbringing and interest in fusing classical and rock had profoundly influenced the direction taken by the band. Blackmore compared the organ-heavy mix of those releases to the works of British progressive rock band the Nice, who featured Keith Emerson on keyboards.Popoff: p. 28 On Deep Purple Lord still had a great influence, which found maximum expression in the harpsicord-flavoured \"Blind\" and in the orchestral section of \"April\", an original piece for choir and string quartet that he composed despite being hard at work in writing and arranging his Concerto for Group and Orchestra. Lord's dominance waned some in this release as more writing and performing space was given to Blackmore, who delivered his longest and, for some critics, best guitar solos to date. Critics also remark Paice's progress as performer, especially on the \"tribal\" opening track \"Chasing Shadows\" where he had his first chance at songwriting. Bass player Nick Simper later stated that \"there was a lot of pressure from Jon Lord to do this kind of semi-classical stuff [and] we didn't actually rebel against it until the third album.\"", "Despite having turned into a highly proficient band on stage, things were starting to heat up internally, with band members getting more vocal about the direction they wanted the music to go, as well as being dissatisfied with their treatment financially. Simper remarked in later interviews, \"Once we started making money, the friendships went out the window.\" He further noted that Blackmore was particularly peeved that Lord and Evans were earning royalties above and beyond the other band members because they had composed the B-side of the \"Hush\" single (\"One More Rainy Day\").Tyler, Kieron On The Roundabout With Deep Purple Retrieved 31 August 2020  Meanwhile, Lord and Blackmore were tired of being identified as a \"clone of Vanilla Fudge\" and were starting to yearn for a sharper, rawer and overall heavier sound, similar to that introduced in Led Zeppelin's debut album, which had become a great success on both sides of the Atlantic, after its release in January 1969. They felt that Rod Evans, with his tender, smooth voice, would not be able to cope with louder, more aggressive material. Evans had also expressed reservations about his permanence in the band and voiced his wish to permanently move to the US.Popoff: p. 46 Tensions were also high with bassist Nick Simper, whose playing style was considered, in Paice's words, \"stuck in the late '50s and early '60s\" by the other band members and unfit for the new musical direction they wanted to pursue.Popoff: p. 48 On the other hand, Simper sided with Blackmore against Lord's excessive influence in the band's songwriting and was critical of classical music getting in the way of harder rock.Popoff: p. 40 As a result of those tensions, communication between band members was at a minimum during the tour. It was in May that Lord and Blackmore agreed on changing the line-up, shifting out Evans.Bloom: p. 125 They talked their ideas over with drummer Paice, gaining his agreement to the line-up change.

On 19 August, they concluded these sessions with the recording of \"Kentucky Woman\" and of the heavy and up-tempo instrumental \"Wring That Neck\", which came out from a tight collaboration between Blackmore and bass player Nick Simper. The name \"Wring That Neck\" comes from a phrase the band used when they were playing live, describing the bassist or guitarist really bursting at their instruments to create a hard noise (i.e., squeezing, or \"wringing\", the neck of the guitar). Another instrumental called \"Playground\" was written and recorded on 18 August, but the lyrics were never completed and it was eventually discarded. \"River Deep - Mountain High\" was always intended as the final track, so its recording was postponed until the other tracks were finished.

Lord's interest in mixing rock and classical music would culminate in late 1969 with his Concerto for Group and Orchestra suite, but he already defined Deep Purple as a symphonic rock band in a 1968 interview. Nick Simper complained about Lord's excessive influence in composition and arrangements in a 1983 interview, which he said \"resulted in a lack of direction for the band.\" \"Anthem\" is perhaps the band's deepest venture into classical music on a regular studio album, with its baroque-style interlude reminiscent of a Bach fugue written by Lord and performed using Mellotron and string quartet. A similar approach can be found on King Crimson's debut album, released a year later.
