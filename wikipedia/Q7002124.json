A conservative Republican, he served 13 terms representing first the state's 12th congressional district and then, after a redrawing of boundaries, the 15th.\nMason was a conservative Republican who represented a rural downstate district. Less flamboyant and less visible than his colleague Everett McKinley Dirksen, he ardently supported states' rights in order to minimize the federal role, for he feared federal regulation of business.  He also favored higher tariffs to protect American business and workers, a position that was increasingly unsupported by the wider Republican Party.  He distrusted Roosevelt, and made many speeches against high federal spending. He criticised New Dealers, such as Eveline Burns, Henry A. Wallace, Adolph A. Berle, Jr., and Paul Porter, as socialists, and suggested their policies resembled fascism. He was a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee (1938\u201343), and in 1950 he championed Joe McCarthy's exposes. During the Eisenhower administration, while praising the Republican president, he opposed substantially all his initiatives, including statehood for Hawaii, and he supported Senator Pat McCarran in sharply restricting immigration to the US. He advocated a radical rewriting of the tax code.", "link_mentions": {}}}
