They developed innovative methods to photograph animals in the wild and, in 1895, published the first natural history book to be entirely illustrated by wild photographs.:\u200a21\u200a Richard was made a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London and Royal Photographic Society. Cherry later became a wildlife and news filmmaker,  and friend to Theodore Roosevelt. The Royal Geographical Society created the Cherry Kearton Medal and Award in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Price (Royal Navy seaman)", "response": ["Price settled in Drewsteignton and became a talented naturalist, eventually developing a substantial collection of birds' eggs and butterflies.  He became a freelance collector for Watkins and Doncaster, of The Strand.  Through this he came to be associated with Richard Kearton, who together with his brother Cherry Kearton, were pioneers in the development of bird photography.  Price too then took up bird photography.  He resumed his fishing, writing a number of books on the subject, including one on carp fishing.  He was also an expert gardener, and on occasion sent produce to be exhibited at the Royal Horticultural Society's shows.  He also grew tobacco, for he was a moderately heavy pipe smoker, curing it using a method he had developed from observing the tobacco industries at Havana and Rhodesia."]}, {"page": "Emma Louisa Turner", "response": ["Emma Louisa Turner or E L Turner   (9 June 1867 \u2013 13 August 1940) was an English ornithologist and pioneering bird photographer. Turner took up photography at age 34, after meeting the wildlife photographer Richard Kearton. She joined the Royal Photographic Society (RPS) in 1901, and by 1904 she had started to give talks illustrated with her own photographic slides; by 1908, when aged 41, she was established as a professional lecturer.", "Turner took up photography after meeting pioneering wildlife photographer Richard Kearton in 1900, joining the Royal Photographic Society in 1901, and by 1904 she had started to give public lectures illustrated with lantern slides of her own photographs. By 1908 she was established as a professional lecturer, producing her own publicity material, and in the 1911 census she gave her occupation as \"lecturer in ornithology\". She typically photographed from close to her subject using dry-plate camera equipment.", "She first visited the Norfolk Broads in 1901 or 1902. Her early contacts included the gamekeeper Alfred Nudd, who would punt her to photographic locations, and his relative Cubit Nudd, who became her general helper on site. Another gamekeeper and professional wildfowler, Jim Vincent, used his extensive knowledge of the area to find birds and nests. Turner's friend, the Reverend Maurice Bird, probably introduced to Turner by Richard Kearton, kept a natural history diary for 50 years and was therefore also able to share information with her.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 11\u201316."]}, {"page": "Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom", "response": ["Chapter 13 analyses \"markings and patterns in detail, starting with a color plate that shows the effect of disruptive patterning, which Thayer calls \"strong 'secant' and 'ruptive' patterns\". Using a photograph of an oystercatcher at its nest by Cherry and Richard Kearton, Thayer argues that the boldly marked bird (mainly black above, white below, with red beak) is both countershaded and \"ruptively\" patterned. Chapter 14 discusses the barred markings of hawks and owls, with further fine plates of photographs by the Keartons of disruptively patterned waders and their cryptic chicks. The ringed plover is described as having \"eye-masking and 'obliterative' shadow-and-hole-picturing pattern\"."]}]}}
