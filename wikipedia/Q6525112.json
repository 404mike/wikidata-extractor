In his second match for his new county, against Warwickshire, Hampton made his highest score of 57 and took his only first-class wicket, that of Leonard Bates.

Warwickshire's best player was the England batsman Bob Wyatt. Other noted batsmen were Leonard Bates, Tom Dollery, Norman Kilner and Jack Parsons. Harry Howell was their best bowler in the 1920s. In the 1930s, Warwickshire had Joseph Mayer, George Paine and the young Eric Hollies.
