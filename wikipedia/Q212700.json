The British called off the attack and sailed downriver to pick up their army, which had retreated from the east side of Baltimore.

The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry, illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort.

The Duke of Terceira landed at Faro and marched north through the Alentejo to capture Lisbon on July 24. Meanwhile, Napier's squadron encountered the absolutists' fleet near Cape Saint Vincent (Cabo S\u00e3o Vicente) and decisively defeated it at the fourth Battle of Cape St. Vincent. The Liberals were able to occupy Lisbon, where Pedro moved from Porto and repulsed a Miguelite siege. A stalemate of nine months ensued. Spain changed sides and started to support the liberals. Towards the end of 1833, Maria da Gl\u00f3ria was proclaimed queen, and Pedro was made regent. His first act was to confiscate the property of all who had served under king Miguel. He also suppressed all religious houses and confiscated their property, an act that suspended friendly relations with Rome for nearly eight years, until mid-1841. The absolutists controlled the rural areas, where they were supported by the aristocracy, and by a peasantry that was galvanized by the Church. The Liberals occupied Portugal's major cities, Lisbon and Porto, where they commanded a sizable following among the middle classes. Operations against the Miguelites began again in earnest in early 1834, a year marked by the end of Spanish support which had changed sides to the liberals in 1833. Meanwhile, the Liberal army had suffered a sound defeat at Alc\u00e1cer do Sal, which proved that, despite the Duke of Terceira's recent march from Faro to Lisbon, the south was still loyal to the Miguelites. In the southernmost region of Continental Portugal, the region of Algarve, a man known as Remexido, hidden in the mountainous terrain around S\u00e3o Marcos da Serra, became a legend as a guerrilla loyal to the legistimist, antiliberal Miguelites until well after the end of the Liberal Wars."]}, {"page": "Charles Napier", "response": ["Charles Napier may refer to:", "*Sir Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer) (1786\u20131860), Royal Navy admiral", "*Charles Napier (RAF officer) (1892\u20131918), British World War I flying ace", "*Charles Napier (actor) (1936\u20132011), American actor", "*Charles Napier, former treasurer of the Paedophile Information Exchange", "*Sir Charles Napier Inn, an early 19th-century pub in Chinnor, Oxfordshire, England, named after the 19th-century general"]}, {"page": "Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["In the 1847 general election, the Ripon constituency returned Graham unopposed. He had resigned from the Carlton Club, and although he received offers of cabinet positions from both sides of the political spectrum, he remained loyal to Peel and hostile to any reversal of Free Trade legislation. He saw the repeal of the Navigation Acts as a vital step in the liberal march, protection or no protection was the battlefield between reaction and progress. After Peel's untimely death, Graham and Aberdeen became the unofficial leaders of the 100 conservative members who had supported free trade. However Graham had lost the support of the influential men who controlled the Ripon seat and while he contemplated his next move a reacquisition arrived from Carlisle, in which almost 500 electors had promised support. On 7 July 1852, Graham returned in triumph at the head of the poll.Carlisle Journal, 8 July 1852 At the victory dinner, Graham mocked protection calling it 'outdoor relief to distressed landlords', he also reaffirmed is support for restrained reform.Wood, p. 257 In December that year the Tory government resigned and Lord Aberdeen became prime minister of a Whig, Peelite, Radical, Liberal alliance. Graham now returned to the Cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty. Shortly afterwards the Eastern Question raised its ugly head and within weeks the Britain and France drifted into the Crimean War with Russia. Graham ordered the fleet to sail through the Dardanelles and eventually into the Black Sea. In April 1854, Queen Victoria recognised Graham services by awarding him the Civil Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.Wood, p. 276 However, once installed notwithstanding previously stating that \"If driven to war, he was for waging it with the utmost vigour and inflicting as much injury as they could on Russia\" the naval action stalled and the war dragged on. Graham was responsible for the choice of Sir Charles Napier to command the fleet in the Baltic. Sir Charles did not relish the inactivity to which he was reduced by the strength of the fortresses of Kronstadt and Sveaborg, which he was forbidden to attack, except in conjunction with the French fleet. The French refused to join in the attempt, and Sir Charles loudly complained on his return of his treatment by the admiralty. It does not seem that Graham was to blame; the shutting up of the Russian fleet was a service of sufficient importance without the glory of an attack upon fortresses which would have cost much bloodshed without an adequate return. On 29 January 1855, John Arthur Roebuck carried a motion demanding an inquiry into the conduct of the warHansard 29 January 1855 vol 136 cols 1121-233 and three weeks later Aberdeen and Graham tendered their resignations."]}, {"page": "Ponza", "response": ["During the 18th century, the Kingdom of Naples re-colonized the island.

This was fine for the numbers required during peacetime when many vessels were laid up in reserve but it meant that some means had to be provided to produce the extra men needed when the fleet expanded in time of war. An Act of Parliament of 1835 had established The Register of Seamen to identify men for naval service in the event of war, but in 1854 just 400 volunteered for duty out of 250,000 on the Register. The Register of Seamen was supplemented in 1853 with the creation of the Royal Naval Coast Volunteers (RNCV) comprising boatmen and fishermen who would undertake limited (geographic) service in the Navy during a conflict. This meant the Baltic fleet of Admiral Charles Napier was seriously undermanned for the blockade of Russia's Baltic ports during the Crimean War, and as an MP Napier campaigned for improvements in the treatment of sailors. This led to a Royal Commission on Manning the Navy in 1858 which resulted in a new Act of Parliament in 1859. This authorised the raising of a new pool of volunteer seamen from the Merchant Service and fishing fleet who would undertake annual training in gunnery with the Navy and be called out for service in the fleet by royal proclamation in time of war. By 1862 there were 12,000 volunteers in the new force."]}, {"page": "Battle of Baltimore", "response": ["* : Capt.

Meanwhile, Miguel's fleet was comprehensively defeated by Pedro's much smaller squadron, commanded by Charles Napier, in the fourth Battle of Cape St. Vincent. The Miguelites were driven out of Lisbon but returned and attacked the city in force, unsuccessfully. Miguel was finally defeated at the Battle of Asseiceira, 16 May 1834, and capitulated a few days later with the Concession of Evoramonte.

The ship was named after the master of the Horseley Ironworks, Tipton, Staffordshire, where she was pre-fabricated to a design jointly formulated by Captain Napier, Aaron Manby and his son Charles.
