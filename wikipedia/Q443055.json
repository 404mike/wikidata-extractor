American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce Carte Blanche, which was published on 26 May 2011.

In October 2014, it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a Bond continuation novel. Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of Goldfinger, it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. Trigger Mortis was released on 8 September 2015.

Perhaps the most famous fictional spy, Bond was introduced in Casino Royale (1953). After Fleming's death the franchise continued under other British and American authors, including Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The Bond novels, which were extremely popular in the 1950s, inspired an even more popular series of films starting in 1962.

However, since the early 1990s there have been attempts to revive his reputation. In 1993 Surviving, a collection of previously unpublished works, edited by his grandson Matthew Yorke, was published by Viking Press. Other works have been reissued. Many contemporary authors have cited him as an influence, including John Updike,Charlie Rose  writing, \"His novels made more of a stylistic impact upon me than those of any writer living or dead\" in an introduction to an edition (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics USA, 1993) of three of Green's novels (Living, Loving and Party Going). The novelist Sebastian Faulks, who also wrote an introduction to an edition (Vintage Classics UK, 2005) of these three novels, calls Green \"unique\" and says: \"No fiction has ever thrilled me as the great moments in Living and Loving\". David Lodge calls Green \"an exceptionally gifted and truly original writer\". In his essay The Genesis of Secrecy Frank Kermode discussed Green's novel Party Going and suggested that behind its realistic surface the book hides a complex network of mythical allusions. This led Kermode to include Green in the Modernist movement and to suggest that the novelist was strongly influenced by T.S. Eliot's idea of a \"mythic method\". Green's work has otherwise received comparatively little critical attention from academics; three of the few academics engaged with Green's work are Nick Shepley, author of Henry Green: Class, Style, and the Everyday (Oxford University Press, 2016) Jeremy Treglown, author of Romancing: The Life and Work of Henry Green (Faber and Faber, 2000), and Becci Carver, author of Granular Modernism (Oxford University Press, 2015).
