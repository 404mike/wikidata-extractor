He was educated at St Cyprian's School and Radley College. Tinling joined the Royal Air Force, but was invalided out following a flying accident in the early 1930s.  He joined Dudley-Williams and Whittle in 1936 to develop Whittle's expired patent for a jet engine.  Tinling, Whittle and Dudley-Williams shared 49% of the new company, with 51% held by the investment bankers OT Falk and Partners, which also provided loan finance. The company, Power Jets,  was based at a factory in Rugby, Warwickshire belonging to British Thomson-Houston, a steam turbine company.  The prototype jet engine was first run on 12 April 1937.  \nTinling married Eileen Nancy Edols on 22 December 1939, at St George's, Hanover Square.  He became chairman of Power Jets in 1941, replacing Lance Whyte, and its prototype Gloster E28/39 first flew on 15 May 1941. Power Jets Ltd. was later bought by the British government, and Tinling remained on the board.   \nTinling died in late 1983 in Kent, survived by his wife. They are both buried in Benenden. He was the brother of Ted Tinling the sports fashion designer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank Whittle", "response": ["Still at Cambridge, Whittle could ill afford the \u00a35 renewal fee for his jet engine patent when it became due in January 1935, and because the Air Ministry refused to pay it the patent was allowed to lapse. Shortly afterwards, in May, he received mail from Rolf Dudley-Williams, who had been with him at Cranwell in the 1920s and Felixstowe in 1930. Williams arranged a meeting with Whittle, himself, and another by-then-retired RAF serviceman, James Collingwood Tinling. The two proposed a partnership that allowed them to act on Whittle's behalf to gather public financing so that development could go ahead.  Whittle thought improvements to his original idea could be patented, noting, \"Its virtue lies entirely in its extremely low weight, and that it will work at heights where atmospheric density is very low.\" This led to three provisional specifications being filed, as the group sought to develop a jet-propelled airplane."]}, {"page": "St Cyprian's School", "response": ["*James Collingwood Tinling (1900\u20131983) \u2013 RAF Officer, who co-built the first jet engine"]}, {"page": "Timeline of jet power", "response": ["* 1935: Whittle allows his patent to lapse after finding himself unable to pay the \u00a35 renewal fee.
