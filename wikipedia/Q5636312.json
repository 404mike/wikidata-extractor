Williams (full name and dates unknown) was an English first-class cricketer who played in four matches for Worcestershire in 1927.\nHis debut against Sussex saw his 12 overs hit for 68 runs, and though he took the wicket of a well-known player in each of his next two games, against Glamorgan (dismissing Emrys Davies) and Leicestershire (dismissing George Geary), against Gloucestershire his seven overs went for 46, and his first-class career ended there. With the bat he was hapless, scoring a total of seven runs in six innings.", "link_mentions": []}}
