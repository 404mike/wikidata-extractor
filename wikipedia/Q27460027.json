Keith Murray, the Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, telephoned him to invite him to a meeting. At this meeting, Murray indicated that a fellowship and tutorship in law had become vacant following Harold Hanbury's appointment as Vinerian Professor of English Law, and that he wished to offer it to Goff. Goff, astonished, asked for half an hour to consider the proposal. In apparent surprise that Goff needed to think about the offer, Murray granted the time, following which Goff accepted the offer, on condition that he could first sit the Bar exams and be called to the Bar. Murray agreed to this and Goff was called by Inner Temple in 1951. In October 1951, he began teaching at Lincoln College, and remained there until the end of the 1954\u201355 academic year. Alongside his teaching, he served on various committees and briefly as dean in 1952\u201353 when the incumbent was on leave. His students included Swinton Thomas, who would become a judge of the Court of Appeal."]}, {"page": "Rock (Nominees) Ltd v RCO Holdings Ltd", "response": ["Potter LJ, Jonathan Parker LJ and Sir Swinton Thomas dismissed the appeal. They held that although the directors had breached their fiduciary duties, Rock Nominees had not suffered prejudice because the best price had been achieved.

According to Channel 4's Geoff White, \"the Dishfire system gives GCHQ a legal loophole to get such information without needing a RIPA request. That's because the text messages are gathered and stored by the NSA - and GCHQ's access to foreign intelligence agencies' stash of data is not covered by any UK law.\" Former UK Interception Commissioner Sir Swinton Thomas drew an analogy between this method of circumventing the UK interception laws and torture in a foreign country, adding that it was a \u201cdifferent area of course, but the concept is very similar\u201d."]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Sir Swinton Thomas, 85, judge."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2016", "response": ["*Sir Swinton Thomas, 85, British judge.Sir Swinton Thomas, Court of Appeal judge \u2013 obituary "]}, {"page": "Interception of Communications Commissioner", "response": ["*2000\u20132006: Sir Swinton Thomas"]}, {"page": "Sir Swinton Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Swinton Thomas"]}, {"page": "Swinton Barclay Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Swinton Thomas"]}, {"page": "Sir Swinton Barclay Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Swinton Thomas"]}]}}
