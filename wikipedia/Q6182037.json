The incident was mentioned in Seven Pillars of Wisdom. Some biographers (Jeremy Wilson, John Mack) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others (Michael Asher, Lawrence James) argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.", "The film shows that Lawrence spoke and read Arabic, could quote the Quran, and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a prewar topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at Kut, Mesopotamia, in 1916. Furthermore, Lawrence is made aware of the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it, but he may well have known about it much earlier while he fought alongside the Arabs.cf. Jeremy Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence (1990), pp. 409\u201310", "Lawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. The authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real, rather than a composite character, and also the highlighting of the Deraa incident. The film's historical inaccuracies, in Wilson's view, are more troublesome than should be allowed under normal dramatic licence. At the time, Liddell Hart publicly criticised the film and engaged Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin.

Some scholars have stated that he exaggerated the severity of the injuries that he suffered,Mack, 1976. or alleged that the episode never actually happened. There is no independent testimony, but the multiple consistent reports and the absence of evidence for outright invention in Lawrence's works make the account believable to some of his biographers.Wilson, 1989, note 49 to Chapter 21. Malcolm Brown, John E. Mack, and Jeremy Wilson have argued that this episode had strong psychological effects on Lawrence, which may explain some of his unconventional behaviour in later life. Lawrence ended his account of the episode in Seven Pillars of Wisdom with the statement: \"In Dera'a that night the citadel of my integrity had been irrevocably lost.\"Lawrence, T. E. (1935). Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Jonathan Cape, p. 447", "Lawrence was a prolific writer throughout his life, a large portion of which was epistolary; he often sent several letters a day, and several collections of his letters have been published. He corresponded with many notable figures, including George Bernard Shaw, Edward Elgar, Winston Churchill, Robert Graves, No\u00ebl Coward, E. M. Forster, Siegfried Sassoon, John Buchan, Augustus John, and Henry Williamson. He met Joseph Conrad and commented perceptively on his works. The many letters that he sent to Shaw's wife Charlotte are revealing as to his character. Foreword by Jeremy Wilson.", "There are many alleged \"embellishments\" in Seven Pillars, though some allegations have been disproved with time, most definitively in Jeremy Wilson's authorised biography. However, Lawrence's own notebooks refute his claim to have crossed the Sinai Peninsula from Aqaba to the Suez Canal in just 49 hours without any sleep. In reality, this famous camel ride lasted for more than 70 hours and was interrupted by two long breaks for sleeping, which Lawrence omitted when he wrote his book.Asher, 1998, p. 259.", "*T. E.

He began work on a clean narrative in the first half of 1919 while in Paris for the Peace Conference and, later that summer, while back in Egypt. By December 1919, he had a fair draft of most of the ten books that make up the Seven Pillars of Wisdom but lost it (except for the introduction and final two books) when he misplaced his briefcase while changing trains at Reading railway station.Robert Graves (op. cit) refers to this incident not as a misplacement but as a theft: \"[Lawrence] has never imagined a political motive for the theft, but his friends have. They even whisper darkly that one day the lost text may reappear in certain official archives.\"Jeremy Wilson, author of Lawrence's authorised biography, also describes it as having been stolen. Jeremy Wilson: T. E. Lawrence STUDIES Seven Pillars of Wisdom- triumph and tragedy telstudies.org, accessed 19 June 2018 National newspapers alerted the public to the loss of the \"hero's manuscript\", but to no avail; the draft remained lost. Lawrence refers to this version as \"Text I\" and says that had it been published, it would have been some 250,000 words in length.", "To eliminate any risk of losing the manuscript again, and to have copies that he could show privately to critics, he considered having the book typed out. However, he discovered that it would be cheaper to get the text typeset and printed on a proofing press at the Oxford Times printing works. Just eight copies were produced, of which six survive. In bibliographical terms the result was the first \"edition\" of Seven Pillars (because the text was reproduced on a printing press). In legal terms, however, these substitutes for a typescript were not \"published\". Lawrence retained ownership of all the copies and chose who was allowed to read them. The proof-printing became known as the \"Oxford Text\" of Seven Pillars. As a text it is unsatisfactory because Lawrence could not afford to have the proof corrected. It therefore contains innumerable transcription errors, and in places lines and even whole paragraphs are missing. He made corrections by hand in five of the copies and had them bound.Jeremy Wilson: T. E. Lawrence STUDIES Seven Pillars of Wisdom- triumph and tragedy telstudies.org, accessed 19 June 2018 (In 2001, the last time one of these rough printings came on to the market, it fetched almost US$1 million at auction.) Instead of burning the manuscript, Lawrence presented it to the Bodleian Library in Oxford.", "After the 1926 release of the Subscribers' Edition, Lawrence stated that no further issue of Seven Pillars would be made during his lifetime. Lawrence was killed in a motorcycle accident in May 1935, at the age of 46, and within weeks of his death, the 1926 abridgement was published for general circulation. The unabridged Oxford Text of 1922 was not published until 1997, when it appeared as a \"best text\" edited by Jeremy Wilson from the manuscript in the Bodleian Library and Lawrence's amended copy of the 1922 proof printing.

Hence, the book has won global reputation, and became a reference to researchers about the subject of Lawrence and the Great Arab Revolt.", ":I believe that, in the long run, Western and Arab historians will reach a common view of the history of the Arab Revolt, based on all the evidence that has survived.
