It proved to be an early dawn for Arsenal, who spent most of the rest of the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman took his time finding the right players to fit his new system, outlining a five-year plan for success.Soar & Tyler, p. 48.

However, he could never knit together a solid winning side and Arsenal's performances gradually declined towards the end of his tenure; they finished 19th in 1923-24 and 20th in 1924-25."]}, {"page": "Billy Milne", "response": ["In September 1921 he made the long journey south by train (Great North of Scotland Railway) from Buckie to join London side Arsenal. Milne made his debut for Arsenal away to Cardiff City on 27 December 1921, but only played another four games that season. However, the following season he became an established regular in the Arsenal side, as a right half, and continued to play there for another four seasons. However, after the arrival of Alf Baker he was dropped; he was a bit-part player for the next few seasons, but in a match against Huddersfield Town on 2 April 1927 he broke his leg and his playing career was effectively finished. In all he played 124 times for Arsenal, scoring three goals."]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Cardiff City had previously reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice, and two years earlier in 1925, they were defeated in the final.Hayes 2003: pp. 15\u201316 Arsenal had never reached a final previously so whoever won would take the trophy for the first time. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman held a press conference on 21 April where he announced that Horace Cope was injured and would be unable to play at left back. He doubted whether Syd Hoar or Alf Baker would be available as both were still recovering from injury, and so he was leaving the selections for both the right half and outside left positions open should they become fit before the game. He saw Bill Seddon and Sam Haden as the alternatives should his first choice players not recover. When asked about who would win the game, he promised the press an answer after the match. Both Baker and Hoar were eventually named in the Arsenal team. The side trained at the Arsenal Stadium on their own pitch before the final. The players met at Hendon Hall Hotel on the morning of the match but their travel plans were disrupted when they became stuck in heavy traffic.

England were soon behind to a goal from Wilf Lewis, and after 40 minutes Hill deflected a cross into his own net. In the second half, Roy Goodall had the chance to bring England back into the game but missed his penalty.
