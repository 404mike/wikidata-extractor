He spent five seasons with Hibs, winning the 1902 Scottish Cup. Gray made 18 league appearances and scored two goals as Hibs then won the 1902\u201303 Scottish First Division title. He also won his one and only cap for Scotland on 21 March 1903, against Ireland; Scotland lost 2\u20130. A week earlier, Gray had represented the Scottish League.In the summer of 1904 Gray moved south to London to join Woolwich Arsenal, who had just been promoted to the First Division for the first time. Gray made his debut in Arsenal's very first First Division match, against Newcastle United on 3 September 1904 and immediately became the club's first-choice right back for the next five seasons; Woolwich Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice (in 1905\u201306 and 1906\u201307), while in the League they usually occupied a comfortable spot in mid-table.\nGray lost his regular place to fellow Scot Duncan McDonald in 1909, but he returned to the team during the 1910\u201311 season. He played in both full back positions, often as cover for Joe Shaw. However, having passed the age of 30 he found his place came under threat from newer, younger players (such as John Peart), and he was largely left out in the 1911\u201312 season. He played his final first-class match, his 200th, against Notts County on 23 December 1911. In spring 1912 he was transferred for \u00a3250 to Second Division Fulham, where he played 25 matches in three seasons, before his retirement in 1915.", "link_mentions": {}}}
