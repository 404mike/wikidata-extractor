Beaton appears annually at the Grandfather Mountain Highland Games in North Carolina, and the Stone Mountain Highland Games in Atlanta, Georgia, two of the largest highland games events in the United States.  Beaton has been called \"probably the country's most popular Scottish folk singer.\" He has a baritone voice.\nAt many events, Beaton not only serves as a key entertainer, but as the event emcee.  Alex is known for his powerful stage presence and sense of humour.  He frequently interacts and jokes with audiences while performing and in-between songs.  One of his albums, Daft Ditties, is composed entirely of comedic songs.  Alex is also known for his keen knowledge of Scotland's history.\nBeaton has released 21 albums on CD and one DVD musical travelogue of Scotland that pulls together three titles that were previously released on VHS tape.  He has featured artists such as Alasdair Fraser and Eric Rigler on his recordings.  Along with his concert appearances, Alex hosts one or two trips to Scotland per year where he served as the host and tour guide.  All tours typically sold out quickly.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music of Scotland", "response": ["Most recently, Scottish piping has included a renaissance for cauldwind pipes such as smallpipes and border pipes, which use cold, dry air as opposed to the moist air of mouth-blown pipes. Other pipers such as Gordon Duncan and Fred Morrison began to explore new musical genres on many kinds of pipes.  The accordion also gained in popularity during the 1970s due to the renown of Phil Cunningham, whose distinctive piano accordion style was an integral part of the band Silly Wizard. Numerous musicians continued to follow more traditional styles including Alex Beaton."]}, {"page": "Eric Bogle", "response": ["Another of his best-known songs, \"No Man's Land\", is also World War I-themed. This song is commonly known as \"The Green Fields of France\", a title it was first given by The Fureys, and which has subsequently been used in many further cover versions. The song refers to the traditional Scottish song \"Flowers of the Forest\" being played over the grave of a World War I soldier. Bogle deliberately gave the dead soldier an Irish name (\"Willie McBride\") as a counter to the anti-Irish sentiment prevalent in Britain during the 1970s. This song has been covered by Alex Beaton (with \"A Scottish Soldier\" from The Water is Wide), Plethyn (\"Gwaed ar eu Dwylo\" (Blood on their Hands), sung in Welsh from \"Blas y Pridd\"), and Hannes Wader (\"Es ist an der Zeit\" (It is the Time)). American folk singer Charlie Zahm also has a version on his album Festival Favorites, as does American Folk Singer Robert Marr on his 2011 album Celticism. The lyrics from the song were referred to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2003 as his favorite anti-war poem."]}, {"page": "Centennial (miniseries)", "response": ["* Alex Beaton"]}, {"page": "Farewell to Nova Scotia", "response": ["The song has been covered, notably, by Tommy Makem, Gordon Lightfoot, Stan Rogers, The Irish Rovers, Ryan's Fancy, Harry Hibbs Paddy Reilly, Ian and Sylvia Tyson, Anne Murray, Touchstone, Stompin' Tom Connors, Real McKenzies, Schooner Fare, Wicked Tinkers, Battlefield Band, Alex Beaton, Aselin Debison, Dan Zanes, Moist, Oisin, Sons of Maxwell, Na h-\u00d2ganaich, and Asonance.
