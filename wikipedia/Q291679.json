Originally performing and recording in her teens, over the years Gillespie has been involved in the recording of over 45 albums, and appeared in stage productions, such as Jesus Christ Superstar, and several films.  Her musical output has progressed from teen pop and folk in the early part of her career, to rock in the 1970s and, more latterly, the blues.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 30", "response": ["*  1949   \u2013 Dana Gillespie, English singer-songwriter and actress"]}, {"page": "Jesus Christ Superstar", "response": ["Superstar opened at the Palace Theatre in London in 1972, starring Paul Nicholas as Jesus, Stephen Tate as Judas and Dana Gillespie as Mary Magdalene. It was directed by Australian Jim Sharman. This production was much more successful than the original production on Broadway, running for eight years and becoming the United Kingdom's longest-running musical at the time. Dmitri Shostakovich attended this production in London just before his death.

Both tracks are primarily led by Bowie's voice, building intensity throughout their runtimes. While \"Five Years\" contains what author David Buckley calls a \"heartbeat-like\" drum beat, \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" starts acoustic and builds to a lush arrangement, backed by an orchestra. Pegg describes \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" as Bowie's own \"A Day in the Life\". The album also features some experimentation. \"Soul Love\" contains bongos, a hand-clap rhythm and a saxophone solo from Bowie, which Doggett calls \"relaxing\". \"It Ain't Easy\" features a harpsichord contribution from Rick Wakeman and backing vocals from Dana Gillespie, both of which were uncredited. Additionally, \"Suffragette City\" features one of Bowie's earliest uses of the ARP synthesiser, which would later become the backbone of his late-1970s Berlin Trilogy.", "*Dana Gillespie\u00a0\u2013 backing vocals (\"It Ain't Easy\") (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Page", "response": ["In 1965, Page was hired by Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham to act as house producer and A&R man for the newly formed Immediate Records label, which allowed him to play on and/or produce tracks by John Mayall, Nico, Chris Farlowe, Twice as Much and Clapton. Also in 1965, Page produced one of Dana Gillespie's early singles, \"Thank You Boy\". Page also formed a brief songwriting partnership with then romantic interest Jackie DeShannon. He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not to be confused with the film composer John Williams) album The Maureeny Wishful Album with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on Donovan Leitch's Sunshine Superman, on Engelbert Humperdinck's Release Me, the Johnny Hallyday albums Jeune homme and Je suis n\u00e9 dans la rue, the Al Stewart album Love Chronicles and played guitar on five tracks of Joe Cocker's debut album, With a Little Help from My Friends.

Again, Ronson was a key part of The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, providing string arrangements and various instrumentation, as well as playing lead guitar. Ronson and Bowie achieved some popularity over the concerts promoting this album, when Bowie would simulate fellatio on Ronson's guitar as he played. Ronson's guitar and arranging during the Spiders from Mars era provided much of the underpinning for later punk rock musicians. In 1972 Ronson provided a strings-and-brass arrangement for the song \"Sea Diver\" on the Bowie-produced All the Young Dudes album for Mott the Hoople. Ronson co-produced Lou Reed's album Transformer with Bowie, playing lead guitar and piano on the songs \"Perfect Day\" and \"Satellite of Love\". Again with Bowie, he re-recorded and produced the track \"The Man Who Sold the World\" for Lulu, released as a single in the UK, and played on a few tracks on the Dana Gillespie album Weren't Born a Man. Ronson appeared on the 1972 country rock album Bustin' Out by Pure Prairie League, where he undertook string ensemble arrangements.

Five days later, on 14 July, the group recorded four takes of \"Quicksand\", the last of which appears on the finished album. On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. Further mixing sessions were carried out between 21 and 26 July to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. By this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" had been recorded; the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album differed from the final versions on Hunky Dory. Two takes of \"The Bewlay Brothers\" were recorded on 30 July, the second appearing on the final album; it was recorded on a tape that contained scrapped versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\". On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the recording process was considered finished. Before the sessions ended, Bowie asked Wakeman if he wanted to be a part of the Spiders from Mars. Wakeman declined and joined the progressive rock band Yes instead.", "The song \"Andy Warhol\" is a tribute to American artist, producer, and director Andy Warhol, who had inspired Bowie since the mid-1960s and was described by him as \"one of the leaders\" of \"the media of the streets, street messages\". Originally written for Bowie's friend Dana Gillespie, the song is based around a riff played on two acoustic guitars that heavily resembles the intro of Ron Davies' \"Silent Song Across the Land\". The lyrics emphasise Warhol's belief that life and art blur together. The song's opening features Ken Scott saying \"This is 'Andy Warhol', and it's take one\", only for Bowie to correct his pronunciation of \"Warhol\". When Bowie met Warhol in September 1971 and played the song for him, Warhol hated it and left the room; Bowie recalled in 1997 that he found the meeting \"fascinating\" because Warhol had \"nothing to say at all, absolutely nothing\"."]}, {"page": "Stefan Weber (musician)", "response": ["|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Greif hier nicht her (with Dana Gillespie)"]}, {"page": "Mac MacLeod", "response": ["After Donovan's first UK tour MacLeod teamed up first with Dana Gillespie then with another regular on the St Albans music scene, Maddy Prior, to form Mac & Maddy.

However, no interviews with him from the 1960s mention either 'Dirty Hugh', 'Dirty Phil' or John Vanstone.
