Lightfoot showed great talent as a student whilst at the Slade School of Art and when he exhibited with the Camden Town Group, but he took his own life at a young age. His obituary in The Times stated, 'All artists and critics.... were united in believing that Lightfoot would have a most distinguished career in the highest rank of painting.'", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stanley Spencer", "response": ["From 1908 to 1912, Spencer studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, under Henry Tonks and others. His contemporaries at the Slade included Dora Carrington, Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot, Mark Gertler, Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth, Isaac Rosenberg and David Bomberg. So profound was his attachment to Cookham that most days he would take the train back home in time for tea. It even became his nickname: his fellow student Christopher R. W. Nevinson dubbed him Cookham, a name which Spencer himself took to using for a time. While at the Slade, Spencer allied with a short-lived group who called themselves the \"Neo-Primitives\"  which was centred on Bomberg and William Roberts."]}, {"page": "Christopher R. W. Nevinson", "response": ["Richard Nevinson was born in Hampstead, one of the two children, and the only son, of the war correspondent and journalist Henry Nevinson and the suffrage campaigner and writer Margaret Nevinson. Educated at Shrewsbury and Uppingham, which he hated, Nevinson went on to study at the St John's Wood School of Art. Inspired by seeing the work of Augustus John, he decided to attend the Slade School of Art, part of University College, London. There his contemporaries included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot, Adrian Allinson and Dora Carrington. Gertler was, for a time, his closest friend and influence, and they formed for a short while a group known as the Neo-Primitives, being deeply influenced by the art of the early Renaissance. Gertler and Nevinson subsequently fell out when they both fell in love with Carrington. Whilst at the Slade, Nevinson was advised by the Professor of Drawing, Henry Tonks, to abandon thoughts of an artistic career. This led to a lifelong bitterness between the two, and frequent accusations by Nevinson, who had something of a persecution complex, that Tonks was behind several imagined conspiracies against him."]}, {"page": "Slade School of Fine Art", "response": ["* Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot (1886\u20131911), painter"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot (1886\u20131911) \u2013 English painter"]}, {"page": "Camden Town Group", "response": ["It was decided that there should be a 16-member, men only, limit on the group: Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot died after the first exhibition, and Duncan Grant was elected to take his place.Baron, Wendy and Sickert, Walter.
