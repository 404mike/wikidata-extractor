Lightfoot showed great talent as a student whilst at the Slade School of Art and when he exhibited with the Camden Town Group, but he took his own life at a young age. His obituary in The Times stated, 'All artists and critics.... were united in believing that Lightfoot would have a most distinguished career in the highest rank of painting.'", "link_mentions": {}}}
