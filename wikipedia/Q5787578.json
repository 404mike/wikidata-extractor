The construction was overseen by David Moore, the curator of the gardens at the time. The original structure was built of wood, and was unstable, leading to it being blown down by heavy gales in 1883, twenty one years later. Richard Turner, the great Dublin ironmaster, had already supplied an iron house to Belfast Gardens and he persuaded the Royal Dublin Society that such a house would be a better investment than a wooden house, and by 1883 construction had begun on a stronger iron structure. Fabrication of the structure took place in Paisley, Scotland, and shipped to Ireland in sections.", "*Dr David Moore (1838\u201379)"]}, {"page": "William Robinson (gardener)", "response": ["Robinson began his garden work at an early age, as a garden boy for the Marquess of Waterford at Curraghmore, County Waterford.Bisgrove, p. 11.

According to one account, as the result of a bitter quarrel, one cold winter night in 1861 he let the fires go out, killing many valuable plants. Other accounts consider the story to be a gross exaggeration.Bisgrove, p. 12. Whether in haste after the greenhouse incident or not, Robinson left for Dublin in 1861, where the influence of David Moore, head of the botanical garden at Glasnevin, a family friend, helped him find work at the Botanical Gardens of Regent's Park, London, where he was given responsibility for the hardy herbaceous plants, specialising in British wildflowers.Massingham, p. 61.", "In 1866, at the age of 29, he became a fellow of the Linnean Society under the sponsorship of Charles Darwin, James Veitch, David Moore, and seven other distinguished botanists and horticulturists. Two months later, he left Regents Park to write for The Gardener's Chronicle and The Times, and represented the leading horticultural firm of Veitch at the 1867 Paris Exhibition.Bisgrove, p. 32. He began writing many of his publications, beginning with Gleanings from French Gardens in 1868, The Parks, Gardens, and Promenades of Paris in 1869, and Alpine Flowers for Gardens, Mushroom Culture,  and The Wild Garden in 1870. In 1871 he launched his own gardening journal, simply named The Garden, which over the years included contributions from notables such as John Ruskin, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gertrude Jekyll, William Morris, Dean Hole, Frank Miles, Canon Ellacombe, and James Britten.Massingham, p. 65.

These seeds were distributed to a number of gardens, and by 1835 three gardens had successfully raised plants to flowering: the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the garden of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, and that of Henry Berens of Sidcup. In that year, the second of these was painted by Sarah Drake, and included as Plate 1728 in Edwards's Botanical Register. In the accompanying text, John Lindley identified the plant as B.\u00a0speciosa (Showy Banksia), but commented \"We found neither the whiteness of the under side of the leaves, nor the faintness of the veins, which are supposed to be characteristic of the species\". Doubts were raised about the identity of the species in 1857, when Walter Hood Fitch painted B.\u00a0victoriae based on a cut flower provided by David Moore of Glasnevin Botanical Garden. Fitch's painting appeared as Plate 4906 in Volume 82 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and was accompanied by the text: \"There can, I think, be no doubt of its being the same with the B.\u00a0speciosa above quoted in the Bot. Reg., but not the B.\u00a0speciosa of Br. and Hook., Bot. Mag. t. 3052; and equally certain does it appear to be the B.\u00a0Victori\u00e6 of Meisner.\" Thus it was implied that 1835 plate was in fact B.\u00a0victoriae, a suggestion that was supported by George Bentham in his treatment of the species in his 1870 Flora Australiensis."]}, {"page": "David Moore", "response": ["David Moore may refer to:", "* David Moore (Australian politician) (1824\u20131898), politician in Sandridge, Victoria, Australia", "* David Moore (Manx politician), member of the House of Keys, 1978\u20131986", "* David Moore (archaeologist), American archaeologist and historian", "* David Moore (botanist born 1808) (1808\u20131879), Scottish botanist", "* David Moore (botanist born 1933) (1933\u20132013), British botanist", "* David Moore (psychologist) (born 1960), American psychologist", "* David Moore (American football) (born 1995), American football player", "* David Moore (cricket coach) (born 1964), Australian cricketer and coach", "* David Moore (footballer, born 1985), English former football striker", "* David Moore (rugby league) (born 1988), Papua New Guinean rugby league footballer", "* David Moore (rugby union) (born 1987), rugby union player", "* David Moore (sport shooter) (born 1953), Australian pistol shooter and Olympic athlete", "* David Moore (military officer) (1817\u20131893), American military officer", "* David Moore (photographer) (1927\u20132003), Australian photojournalist", "* David Moore (restaurateur) (born 1964), restaurateur in the UK", "* David Moore, British photographer noted for his photographs of the Military citadels under London"]}, {"page": "Alexander Goodman More", "response": ["* Cybele Hibernica (1866), with David Moore.*Timothy Collins, Dodos and Discord: A Biographical Note on A.G.

The first to describe this species was Carl Linnaeus in 1763, based on a specimen from his private herbarium, and he called it Aster tenellus. In 1820, Henri Cassini described Felicia fragilis, which he erroneously considers to be synonymous to Aster fragilis L.. In 1822, Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link assigned Linnaeus\u2019 species to the genus Cineraria, creating C. tenella. In 1833, Nees von Esenbeck included the species in the genus Felicia, creating the new combination F. tenella. William Henry Harvey distinguished Aster tenellus var. robustus in 1865. David Moore again moved the species in 1899, now to the genus Detris, that is currently considered a synonym of Felicia, creating the name D. tenella. J\u00fcrke Grau in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia, distinguished four subspecies, and assigned all the above names to subspecies tenella."]}, {"page": "Frederick William Moore", "response": ["He was the eldest son of David Moore, then curator of the botanic gardens, and his third wife, Margaret Baker (1833/4\u20131917). The family included four other children, two girls and two boys. Frederick was singled out by his father for a career in horticulture, and was accordingly encouraged to study botany. Frederick and his younger brother, David Francis (Frank), were sent to a school in Hanover in 1869. Frederick became a frequent visitor to the Herrenhausen Gardens and befriended the director Herman Wendland. Three years in Germany made the boys fluent in German and French, but their English suffered. Frederick enrolled at the Royal School, Armagh, and later in October 1873 as an occasional student in the Royal College of Science, Dublin, following courses in chemistry, geology, descriptive geometry, and surveying. He successfully wrote the entrance examinations for the Indian Forest Service, but was not chosen for training."]}, {"page": "Ninian Niven", "response": ["Niven was an active member of the Royal Horticultural Society, serving as secretary from 1847 to 1853.

He won a silver medal from the Royal Dublin Society in 1835 for an essay on the potato crop failure. During the Great Famine, he published a pamphlet, The potato epidemic and its probable consequences, in the form of an open letter to Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster. He mistakenly attributed the cause of the potato disease to atmospheric conditions, unlike David Moore, who correctly deduced the cause of the blight. In 1869 he published a volume of poems, Redemption thoughts."]}]}}
