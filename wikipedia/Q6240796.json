On the Board of Directors Dr John Inglis argued strongly for investment in the construction of new locomotives. Ultimately it was the persuasive arguments of Inglis, and the design skills of Locomotive Superintendent William Paton Reid, which led to the development of the NBR's new flagship locomotive, the North British Atlantic. The NBR Board met on 2 November 1905 and approved the construction of 14 heavy express passenger locomotives, with design work to commence immediately. The designs were drawn up by NBR Chief Draughtsman Walter Chalmers and were presented to the Board on 5 January 1906, tenders were invited on 13 January 1906, and the order placed before the end of the month."]}]}}
