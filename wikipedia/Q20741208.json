He thereupon set himself up as a timber merchant on East Terrace, Adelaide, and grew quite wealthy.\nEmil Wentzel was MHA for Encounter Bay from April 1870 \u2013 December 1871. His term in parliament was remarkable for a deputation from his electorate calling for his resignation. He was not a candidate at the subsequent election. He returned to Baden-Baden, Germany, where he died.\nHe was married but had no children, his wife surviving him. His will provided, after the death of his wife, for the establishment of two educational endowments: The Emil Wentzel endowment for students at the Royal Prussian Academy of Arts at Berlin and The Emil Wentzel endowment for students at the Royal Prussian High School for Technology at Berlin. Half the recipients were to be German and half South Australian, but only to go to students of some means, as he did not want to fund a charity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1870\u201371", "response": ["|| Emil Wentzel || Encounter Bay || 1870\u20131871"]}, {"page": "Wentzel", "response": ["* Emil Wentzel (c. 1817\u20131892), timber merchant and politician in South Australia"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Encounter Bay", "response": ["| Emil Wentzel"]}, {"page": "Arthur Fydell Lindsay", "response": ["Lindsay served as the first member of the House of Assembly for the single-person electorate of Encounter Bay for the terms March 1857 \u2013 April 1860, when his colleagues were Benjamin Herschel Babbage and Henry Strangways.

He argued strongly for the construction of light railways on the narrow gauge system, but received little support, though he was later largely vindicated."]}]}}
