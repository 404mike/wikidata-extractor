He started on the right wing in a 3\u20132 home win. He went on to make 70 appearances for the club, including the first match against Ajax Amsterdam in the first ever European Super Cup. Fyfe also scored 23 goals which was not bad at all from a midfielder.\nHe left to join Hibernian after seven seasons in Govan, but his stay in Edinburgh was short lived, as he moved on to Dumbarton the following year. He played at Boghead Park for two seasons before moving to the US to play with Major Indoor Soccer League sides Pittsburgh Spirit and Cleveland Force.\nIn 1980, Fyfe said that he had to leave Rangers because he had married a girl who was Catholic. However, the media of the period approached other Rangers players who had married Catholic women, including Bobby Russell (who played 370 games for Rangers), and they did not support Fyfe's claims.Fyfe signed with the St. Louis Steamers in 1983 and spent one season with them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Graham Fyfe", "response": ["Graham Fyfe may refer to:", "* Graham Fyfe (footballer, born 1982), ex-Celtic F.C. player who currently plays for Hawke's Bay United", "* Graham Fyfe (footballer, born 1951), ex-Rangers F.C. and Dumbarton player"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Graham Fyfe"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Graham Fyfe"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Graham Fyfe"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Graham Fyfe"]}, {"page": "Graham Fyfe (footballer born 1951)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graham Fyfe (footballer, born 1951)"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Graham Fyfe"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Graham Fyfe"]}, {"page": "Rangers F.C. signing policy", "response": ["Despite the policy, some Catholic players did play for Rangers during this time.

In 1980, for example, Graham Fyfe said that he had to leave Rangers because he had married a Catholic woman. The former Rangers player and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has written that although Rangers' management knew of his decision to marry a Catholic, he experienced \"poisonous hostility\" from the club's PR officer Willie Allison.Ferguson, Alex. 1999 Managing my Life"]}]}}
