British band Marmaduke Duke performed a cover version in April 2009 on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge show. In October 2009, it was released on Radio 1's Live Lounge \u2013 Volume 4, a compilation of Live Lounge recordings. Australian singer Stan Walker sang a jazzier version of the song on the seventh series of Australian Idol in October 2009. The same year, elementary school group PS22 chorus covered \"Single Ladies\" and \"Halo\" (2009) during Billboards annual Women In Music luncheon held at The Pierre in New York City. In her short-lived Broadway revue \"All About Me\" in March 2010, Dame Edna Everage performed a version of the song with backup dancers Gregory Butler and Jon-Paul Mateo. It was also covered by Jeff Tweedy and British singer-songwriter Alan Pownall. According to Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly, Tweedy sang only a few bars; he gave \"Single Ladies\" an acoustic feel and recited the rest of the song's lyrics. He performed the hand movements that Beyonc\u00e9 and her dancers do in the song's video. Pomplamoose, an American indie music duo consisting of Jack Conte and Nataly Dawn, recorded a cover of \"Single Ladies\" on video, which makes use of split screens to show Dawn on vocals and Conte playing the instruments. Inspired by the avant-garde Dogme 95 movement in cinema, Conte began to record songs on video as a quick way to create \"organic and raw\" music. They chose \"Single Ladies\" as they believed that it would help them grow their audience."]}, {"page": "Pownall", "response": ["*Alan Pownall (b. 1986), British singer-songwriter", "*Charles Alan Pownall (1887-1975), US Navy rear admiral and 3rd Military Governor of Guam"]}, {"page": "The Family Jewels Tour", "response": ["*Alan Pownall (21\u201423 February 2010)"]}, {"page": "Apple Music Festival", "response": ["* July 7: Paloma Faith (EP) + Alan Pownall"]}, {"page": "Jakwob", "response": ["|Alan Pownall "]}, {"page": "Gabriella Wilde", "response": ["Wilde married musician Alan Pownall on 13 September 2014, both previously having attended Windlesham House School.
