At half time Wales were 7\u20130 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in the first half of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the halfway line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed."]}, {"page": "Clifton College", "response": ["* Edwin Field, Middlesex cricketer, England rugby international"]}, {"page": "1893 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["England: Edwin Field (Cambridge U.), Andrew Stoddart (Blackheath) capt., RE Lockwood (Heckmondwike), Frederic Alderson (Hartlepool Rovers), Howard Marshall (Blackheath), FR de Winton (Blackheath), Frank Evershed (Blackheath), JH Greenwell (Rockcliff), Sammy Woods (Wellington), J Toothill (Bradford), H Bradshaw (Bramley), T Broadley (Bingley), Philip Maud (Blackheath), FC Lohden (Blackheath), William Bromet (Tadcaster)", "England: Edwin Field (Cambridge U.), RE Lockwood (Heckmondwike), JW Dyson (Huddersfield), T Nicholson (Rockcliff), EW Taylor (Rockcliff), H Duckett (Bradford), Frank Evershed (Blackheath), JH Greenwell (Rockcliff), Sammy Woods (Wellington) capt., J Toothill (Bradford), H Bradshaw (Bramley), Alfred Allport (Blackheath), Philip Maud (Blackheath), William Yiend (Hartlepool Rovers), William Bromet (Tadcaster)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Cliftonians", "response": ["* Edwin Field, Middlesex cricketer, England rugby international"]}, {"page": "List of cricket and rugby union players", "response": ["| Edwin Field"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|250||Edwin Field||fullback ||1893-01-07||v Wales at Cardiff"]}, {"page": "Field (surname)", "response": ["* Edwin Field (1872\u20131947), English rugby and cricket player"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University R.U.F.C.", "response": ["*  Edwin Field"]}, {"page": "Walter Field", "response": ["Field resided principally at Hampstead, and was untiring in his efforts for the preservation of the natural beauties of Hampstead Heath; he was the main founder of the Hampstead Heath Protection Society.
