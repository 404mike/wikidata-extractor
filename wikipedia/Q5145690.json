Not all the recommendations of the Odendaal Commission were implemented. In 1969, shortly after Colin Winter became bishop, the South African government undertook a \"rearrangement\", which would make Namibia more like a province of South Africa. Control of several government departments was transferred to Pretoria in order to apply the \"homelands\" policy.", "Ovambo nationalists who supported the \"homelands\" policy, led by a deacon, the Revd Petrus Kalangula, and encouraged by South African government agents, broke away to form the \"Ovamboland Anglican Church\".  Most Ovambo Anglicans, however, preferred the idea of a united church in a united Namibia, and rejected both the homeland government of Ushona Shiimi and its religious arm, established by Petrus Kalangula. This crisis took up a great deal of the time of Bishop Colin Winter in the early part of his episcopate.", "Anglican bishop Colin Winter fully supported the Lutheran stand, while the Roman Catholic bishops offered qualified support.", "Soon after this there was a rather strange series of events that led to the deportation of Bishop Colin Winter. David de Beer, the diocesan treasurer, was asked to speak to a student group at the University of the Witwatersrand (his alma mater) on Namibia. Among other things he spoke about the contract labour system, saying that it was a form of slavery, and mentioned an incident in which the supervisor of a group of contact workers had threatened them with immediate dismissal if they bought Bibles, on the grounds that they were \"communist Bibles\". So the employers controlled the workers' leisure time, and told them what they could or could not read.", "In 1972-02 twelve contract workers from  Windhoek appeared in court, charged with being ringleaders of the strike and Bishop Colin Winter arranged for their legal defence. At about the same time, four members of the congregation of St Luke's Church, Epinga, were shot dead by South African security forces after a Sunday service. Bishop Winter was issued with deportation orders, as were three members of his staff.", "In November 1972 the diocesan synod asked Colin Winter not to resign as bishop, but to remain as bishop in exile. To ensure that episcopal ministry would still be provided a priest, Richard Wood was elected and consecrated as suffragan bishop, but was himself deported on 16 June 1975.", "By that time James Kauluma, who had left Namibia 12 years earlier to study overseas, had been elected and consecrated as suffragan bishop to replace Richard Wood. Since he had been born in Namibia, he could not be deported. On the death of Colin Winter in 1981, James Kauluma was elected as diocesan bishop and so became the sixth Anglican Bishop of Namibia and the first who was Namibian born."]}, {"page": "Peter Kalangula", "response": ["He was ordained as a deacon in the Church of the Province of Southern Africa, but was not ordained as a priest because of a strong disagreement with Bishop Colin Winter in November 1969.

He then broke away and formed the Ovamboland Anglican Church as an African independent church, with the support of South African government officials and the Security Police. The Ovamboland Anglican Church was later associated with the Church of England in South Africa, and Kalangula was ordained a priest in the CESA in 1979."]}, {"page": "James Kauluma", "response": ["He studied at the Dorothea Mission in Johannesburg between 1958 and 1959, and in Kenya, before returning to Namibia in 1964.

He and his wife Laureen Morrow put some of their furniture into storage, sold some more, and bought a second-hand Volkswagen Kombi with the proceeds, packed the remaining furniture into it, and set off for Windhoek, 1800 kilometres away."]}, {"page": "List of Anglicans", "response": ["*Colin Winter "]}, {"page": "The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay", "response": ["After being inhabited by Eve Fleming, the estate was bought by David Astor in 1958, who leased it to the Ockenden Venture which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children.
