The lease negotiation also agreed that no matches were to be played on \"holy days\" and that no \"intoxicating liquor\" would be sold at the stadium; however, these stipulations were dropped within a year. The stadium was hurriedly built over the summer of that year, and was designed by Archibald Leitch, architect of many other football grounds of that era. It featured a single stand on the eastern side and the other three sides had banked terracing. The new stadium cost \u00a3125,000. It opened whilst not fully complete, with Arsenal's first match of the 1913\u201314 season, a 2\u20131 Second Division win against Leicester Fosse on 6 September 1913.

On 6 September 1913, Arsenal faced Leicester Fosse in their very first match at their new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury. After Leicester's Tommy Benfield had become the first player to score at the new stadium, Jobey joined him in the record books as the first Arsenal player to do so, heading home just before half-time.
