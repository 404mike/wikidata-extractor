Their location and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed an enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker, implemented Charlie Buchan's new twist on the nascent WM formation, captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James. With record-breaking spending and gate receipts, Arsenal quickly became known as the Bank of England club.", "World War II meant The Football League was suspended for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947\u201348. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952\u201353. However, the war had taken its toll on Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club, and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.", "The club's current manager is Mikel Arteta. The club's previous manager was Unai Emery, who was appointed in May 2018 and left the club in November 2019. There have been nineteen permanent managers and six caretakers of Arsenal since the appointment of the club's first professional manager, Thomas Mitchell in 1897. The club's longest-serving manager, in terms of both length of tenure and number of games overseen, is Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who managed the club between 1996 and 2018. Two Arsenal managers have died in the job\u00a0\u2013 Herbert Chapman and Tom Whittaker."]}, {"page": "Stanley Matthews", "response": ["He helped the Tangerines to record a sixth-place finish in 1953\u201354, though hopes of retaining their FA Cup title were ended with a defeat to Port Vale at Vale Park in the Fifth Round. Matthews missed just eight league games in 1954\u201355, though journalists were keen to write him off with every occasional off-performance and missed game \u2013 \"it was all balderdash\", he replied. Despite his age, and more pertinently the media's constant references to his age, Arsenal manager Tom Whittaker tried, unsuccessfully, to lure Matthews to Highbury with a lucrative, if somewhat illegal approach."]}, {"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["In November 1953, Lawton was traded to First Division champions Arsenal for \u00a37,500 plus James Robertson who was valued at \u00a32,500. He was signed by manager Tom Whittaker, who had previously found success in bringing in veterans such as Ronnie Rooke and Joe Mercer. However Lawton was limited to ten appearances in the 1953\u201354 campaign after picking up an injury on his debut. He also played in the 1953 Charity Shield, scoring one goal as Arsenal beat Blackpool 3\u20131. He scored seven goals in 20 appearances throughout the 1954\u201355 season, including winning goals against Chelsea and Cardiff City. He scored a hat-trick past Cardiff City on the opening day of the 1955\u201356 season, before he announced his decision to leave Arsenal to pursue a career in management eight games into the campaign."]}]}}
