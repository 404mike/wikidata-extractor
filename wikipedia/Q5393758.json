He was first selected for the Welsh squad in the opening game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship in a match played at St Helen's against England. Thomas was one of three first caps in the Welsh pack for the game, the other two were Ernest Rowland from Lampeter University and Swansea's Evan Richards, but the team is best remembered for introducing Arthur Gould to the Wales team. Wales lost the game, but Thomas was re-selected for the very next game, away to Scotland. Wales drew the game in a nil - nil result and Thomas was dropped for the next tournament. His cap and jersey are held at the Neath clubhouse."]}]}}
