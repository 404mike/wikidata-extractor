He also edited Science Fantasy from the 1950s. After the magazines were sold to another publisher he left to launch the New Writings in Science Fiction anthology series, editing 21 issues until his death, after which the series was continued by Kenneth Bulmer for a further 9 issues.\nTaken together his publications played a role in starting the careers of Damien Broderick, Brian W. Aldiss, James White, J. G. Ballard, and his successor at New Worlds, Michael Moorcock. Despite that list, Carnell tended to prefer adventure and Hard SF to New Wave experimentation so John Christopher, Kenneth Bulmer, and E. C. Tubb were more typical of his tenure. However, he was not seen as an opponent of the New Wave in the way John W. Campbell tended to be, and he even published a number of more experimental works by such authors as J. G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Aldiss", "response": ["About this time he also began to write science fiction for various magazines. According to ISFDB, his first speculative fiction in print was the short story Criminal Record, published by John Carnell in the July 1954 issue of Science Fantasy.

At age 18 (in 1958), he wrote the allegorical fantasy novel The Golden Barge. This remained unpublished until 1980, when it was issued by Savoy Books with an introduction by M. John Harrison. At 19 years of age Moorcock also edited Sexton Blake Library (serial pulp fiction featuring Sexton Blake, the poor man's Sherlock Holmes) and returned to late Victorian London for some of his books. Writing ever since, he has produced a huge volume of work. His first story in New Worlds was \"Going Home\" (1958; with Barrington J. Bayley). \"The Sundered Worlds\", a 57-page novella published in the November 1962 number of Science Fiction Adventures, edited by John Carnell, became, with its sequel \"The Blood Red Game\" from the same magazine, the basis for his 190-page paperback debut novel three years later, The Sundered Worlds (Compact Books, 1965; in the U.S., Paperback Library, 1966)."]}, {"page": "New Wave science fiction", "response": ["\"In April 1963 Michael Moorcock contributes a guest editorial to John Carnell's New Worlds, Britain's leading SF magazine, which effectively announced the onset of the New Wave.\""]}, {"page": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "response": ["The adaptations were scripted by John Carnell.

You have no idea how difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when they have got a story that is possible to do on television. So many you can't. Either the conception is so way out you would need a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too tight to be padded out to make an hour's television\".Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 31. When working on Out of this World Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of science fiction magazine New Worlds, and agent for many of Britain's science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for her to consider. Shubik received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers, and also sought advice from many authors including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. The latter two admitted to her that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. She considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel The Deep Range.Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 25."]}, {"page": "John Christopher", "response": ["*Gateway To Tomorrow edited by John Carnell, published by Panther (1963)"]}, {"page": "Doctor Who Magazine", "response": ["| Story Richard Alan/John Carnell; art Dougie Braithwaite/Dave Elliott", "| Story John Carnell; art Andy Lanning/Kev Hopgood"]}, {"page": "Science Fantasy (magazine)", "response": ["Science Fantasy, which also appeared under the titles Impulse and SF Impulse, was a British fantasy and science fiction magazine, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as a companion to Nova's New Worlds.

Carnell wanted to turn New Worlds into a professional magazine, and through W.J. Passingham, a writer, had begun discussions with a publisher named The Worlds Says Ltd.  In January 1940 Carnell was asked to put together three issues, and Carnell and Passingham each put up \u00a350 towards costs.  Carnell solicited material from British authors including John F. Burke, C.S. Youd, and David McIlwain, and acquired Robert A. Heinlein's \"Lost Legion\", but in March internal strife led to the collapse of The World Says.

A printer was found near Stoke Newington, where Frank Cooper was based, and the first issue (numbered 4, to follow on from the three Pendulum issues) appeared in June. It was planned to move to regular quarterly publication, and subsequently to a bimonthly schedule.  To keep costs down Nova decided to handle the distribution themselves; this was not easy but Cooper and his assistant, Les Flood, were sufficiently successful that in July the decision was taken to go ahead with the planned quarterly schedule.
