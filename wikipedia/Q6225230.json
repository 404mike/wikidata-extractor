He also edited Science Fantasy from the 1950s. After the magazines were sold to another publisher he left to launch the New Writings in Science Fiction anthology series, editing 21 issues until his death, after which the series was continued by Kenneth Bulmer for a further 9 issues.\nTaken together his publications played a role in starting the careers of Damien Broderick, Brian W. Aldiss, James White, J. G. Ballard, and his successor at New Worlds, Michael Moorcock. Despite that list, Carnell tended to prefer adventure and Hard SF to New Wave experimentation so John Christopher, Kenneth Bulmer, and E. C. Tubb were more typical of his tenure. However, he was not seen as an opponent of the New Wave in the way John W. Campbell tended to be, and he even published a number of more experimental works by such authors as J. G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss.", "link_mentions": {}}}
