About 1790 he entered upon gardening work in some nurseries near Edinburgh, and subsequently made his way to London, where he became gardener to James Vere, of Kensington Gore, a wealthy silk merchant who had a large collection of plants.In 1814 he was appointed by the Society of Apothecaries gardener\u2014a title changed during his occupancy of the office to curator\u2014of their botanic garden at Chelsea, a post which he filled until his death. He at once set to work to raise the garden from the state of neglect into which it had fallen, and his efforts were attended with great success. He was said to be tall and burly, somewhat rough in manners and appearance, but warm-hearted and charitable. He was elected an associate of the Linnean Society in 1798, and became a fellow in 1815; he contributed various papers on horticultural subjects to the Gardener's Magazine and Horticultural Society's Transactions. He died at Chelsea, 6 October 1846, and is buried in the churchyard of the old church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Anderson", "response": ["William Anderson may refer to:", "* William Anderson (artist) (1757\u20131837), painter of marine and historical paintings", "* William Anderson (theatre) (1868\u20131940), Australian stage entrepreneur", "* William Anderson (1911\u20131986),  American actor, better known as Leif Erickson", "* William Anderson (guitarist) (born 1962), American classical guitarist and composer", "*William Anderson (Scottish writer) (1805\u20131866), Scottish miscellaneous writer", "*William Anderson (American writer) (born 1952), American biographer, specializing on Laura Ingalls Wilder", "*William Anderson (Victorian politician, born 1828) (1828\u20131909), Scottish-born Victorian colonial politician, member for  Villiers and Heytesbury", "*William Anderson (Victorian politician, born 1853) (1853\u20131898), Victorian colonial politician for Creswick, and Windermere", "*William Anderson (Tasmanian politician) (1904\u20131990), Australian politician from Tasmania", "*William Anderson (Ontario MPP) (1822\u20131897), Canadian politician", "*William Anderson (Ontario MP) (1905\u20131961), member of Canadian House of Commons for Waterloo South electoral district", "* William Anderson (Pennsylvania politician) (1762\u20131829), U.S. Congressman from Pennsylvania", "* William Anderson (naval officer) (1921\u20132007), U.S. Representative from Tennessee", "* William Anderson (British politician) (1877\u20131919), British socialist politician", "* William Anderson (New Zealand politician) (1888\u20131978), mayor of Queenstown, New Zealand", "*William Anderson (collector) (1842\u20131900), British surgeon and collector of Japanese art who first described Anderson-Fabry disease", "* William Anderson (1820\u20131848), British Army lieutenant with the 1st Bombay Fusiliers whose murder affected the Second Anglo-Sikh War", "* William Anderson (Medal of Honor) (1852\u20131908), American sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "* William Anderson (VC) (1885\u20131915), Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* William Anderson (RAAF officer) (1891\u20131975), Australian air marshal", "* William Anderson (Canadian Army officer) (1915\u20132000), Canadian general", "* William Anderson (naval officer) (1921\u20132007), commander of the first nuclear submarine", "* William Anderson (died 1543), one of the Perth Martyrs", "* William Anderson (missionary) (1769\u20131852), English-Anglican missionary to South Africa", "* William Anderson (minister) (1799\u20131873), Scottish theological writer and preacher", "* William Anderson (bishop of Salisbury) (1892\u20131972), Anglican Bishop of Croydon, of Portsmouth and of Salisbury, England", "* William Anderson (bishop of Caledonia) (born 1950), Canadian Anglican bishop since 2001", "* William Anderson (naturalist) (1750\u20131778), naturalist on Captain Cook's third voyage (1776\u20131780)", "* William Anderson (horticulturist) (1766\u20131846), Scottish horticulturist", "* William Anderson (engineer) (1835\u20131898), British engineer and philanthropist", "* William Anderson (cricket umpire) (1910\u20131975), South African Test match umpire in two games", "* William Anderson (cricketer, born 1859) (1859\u20131943), French Olympic silver medal-winning cricketer", "* William Anderson (cricketer, born 1871) (1871\u20131948), English cricketer", "* William Anderson (cricketer, born 1909) (1909\u20131975), English first class cricketer", "* William Anderson (Scottish cricketer) (1894\u20131973), Scottish cricketer from Fife", "* William Anderson (Scottish footballer) (c. 1860\u2013?), 1885 FA Cup Finalist with Queen's Park in 1884 and 1885 and Scotland international", "* William Anderson (rugby union) (died 1892), New Zealand rugby union player  ", "* William Anderson (ice hockey) (1901\u20131983), British ice hockey player who competed in the 1924 Winter Olympics", "* William Anderson (cyclist) (1888\u20131928), Canadian Olympic cyclist", "* William Anderson (athlete) (died 1915), Irish athlete", "* Chief William Anderson, namesake of Anderson, Indiana", "* William Anderson (political scientist) (1888\u20131975), professor at University of Minnesota"]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Anderson\"|William Anderson, William Anderson and Alexander Anderson"]}]}}
