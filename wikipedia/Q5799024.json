Dost Mohammad Khan refused to submit however, and believed that the network of alliances which he had built up during the past few years over the entire Baluchistan Province south of the Sarhadd district. However, these very same alliances which Dost Mohammad had built his trust on dissolved as soon as Iranian government General Amanullah Jahanbani entered the area. The Baluch Rigi, Gamshad-zai, Yar-Mohammad-zai and Ismail-zai tribes were allied with Reza Shah against Dost Mohammad Khan. Thus, Dost Mohammad Khan was left with a relatively small force and a few allies \"of any consequence\". The Iranian army easily defeated Dost Mohammad Khan. The anthropologist Brian Spooner adds: \"once Baluch political unity proved highly brittle\". Dost Mohammad Khan eventually surrendered to the Iranian governmental forces and was subsequently pardoned on condition that he live in the Iranian capital of Tehran. One year after moving to Tehran, however, he managed to escape while he was on a hunting trip. He was quickly captured, and, as he had killed his guard during his escape, he was hanged for murder."]}, {"page": "Brian J.
