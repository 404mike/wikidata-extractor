He also brought in winger Mark Angel, midfielders Mario Bortolazzi and Enzo Maresca, and striker Fabian de Freitas. However, the player who had the greatest impact for West Brom was young striker Lee Hughes, who had been signed before Smith's arrival but only made his first start under Smith. Aside from Maresca, many of Smith's signings had little impact, and supporters criticised him for allowing popular goalkeeper Alan Miller and strikers Andy Hunt and Bob Taylor to leave the club. West Brom started the season well with Hughes in tremendous form, but a slump in form in March 1999 left them ending up in 12th place. Smith was dismissed on 27 July 1999, just a week before the start of 1999\u20132000."]}, {"page": "Paul Crichton", "response": ["His spell at the Hawthorns was frustrating for Crichton as he spent a lot of time on the bench, playing only 33 games in 2 years with the club, and finding himself playing second fiddle to Alan Miller, a goalkeeper signed for \u00a3400,000 shortly after Crichton's arrival. Crichton was again farmed out on loan, first for a week from 7 August 1997 to Aston Villa, as a standby goalkeeper while Mark Bosnich was injured, but manager Brian Little selected Michael Oakes in goal and Crichton never played a competitive game for Villa."]}, {"page": "Chris Adamson", "response": ["Adamson joined West Bromwich Albion as an apprentice in April 1995, turning professional in July 1997; he made his Albion d\u00e9but away at Stockport County on 11 April 1998. He generally found it difficult to break into the Albion first team, and remained an understudy to more experienced keepers such as Alan Miller, Brian Jensen and Russell Hoult. Adamson spent time on loan at various clubs, including IK Brage in Sweden, Mansfield Town, Halifax Town, Plymouth Argyle and Halesowen Town. Adamson then signed for League of Ireland side St Patrick's Athletic. In 2003, he was nominated for the League of Ireland 'Goalkeeper of the Year'."]}, {"page": "Kevin Cuthbert", "response": ["Born in Perth, Cuthbert made his St Johnstone debut in September 2001 after an injury to Alan Main. He remained in goal for the following two games, after which Main returned only to break his leg. Instead of turning to Cuthbert again, then-manager Sandy Clark brought in Alan Miller on loan from Blackburn Rovers as cover. Later that same season, in which St Johnstone lost their Scottish Premier League status, Cuthbert was given a seven-game run of starts."]}, {"page": "Dean Williams (footballer, born 1972)", "response": ["Williams, born in Tamworth, Staffordshire, signed for Birmingham City on schoolboy forms at 14.
