It was originally brewed by William McEwan's Fountain Brewery in Edinburgh, Scotland. The McEwan's brand passed to Heineken in 2008 after their purchase of Scottish & Newcastle's British operations. Heineken sold the brand to Wells & Young's in 2011, who sold their brewing operation, including the McEwan brand to Marston's in 2017. Cans and bottles are now brewed in Bedford, England.", "William McEwan opened the Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, Edinburgh, in 1856. The firm underwent several mergers in the following century, including with local rival William Younger's, and later with Newcastle Breweries to form Scottish & Newcastle. Its popular brands included 80/-, a Heavy beer, and Export, an India Pale Ale. All of the draught beers (except Best Scotch) were brewed at the Caledonian Brewery in Edinburgh, whilst the canned and bottled beers were produced at the Eagle Brewery in Bedford, England. The beers are sold predominantly in Scotland and the North East of England.", "William McEwan opened the Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the outskirts of Edinburgh, in 1856, using \u00a32,000 loaned by his mother and his uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the spring waters from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early-1860s, McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections.  It was during this time that McEwan's India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.", "By the 1870s, McEwan's brewery employed 170 men and boys, and its beers were widely available in England. By 1880, the brewery site covered 12 acres. McEwan's 80/-,  a Heavy beer, was first brewed in the late nineteenth century; the shilling \"/-\" denotion refers to the wholesale price for a hogshead of the beer.The blog of a published beer historian.  In 1886, as he prepared to enter Parliament, William McEwan appointed his nephew, William Younger, as managing director of the brewery. When the company was registered in 1889, it was worth \u00a3408,000 and had capital of \u00a31 million; and was the largest brewery in the United Kingdom under a single owner. By the turn of the twentieth century the company had a large share of the market throughout Scotland, a 90% share of the Tyneside market, and was exporting to Scottish expatriates across the British Empire. At its peak, the brewery was producing two million barrels of beer a year; much of it for export.", "The company merged with Newcastle Breweries in 1960, forming Scottish & Newcastle, a group with market value of \u00a350,000,000. William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the chairman and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the free trade, and promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan's Export became one of the three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle Brown Ale and Younger's Tartan Special. Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the highest gravity beer on general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970."]}, {"page": "City Observatory", "response": ["In the wake of the Royal Observatory moving to Blackford Hill, a new City Observatory was created on Calton Hill toward the end of the 19th century.

Additional domes were built for a 13-inch (33\u00a0cm) reflector donated by Robert Cox and for a 13-inch (33\u00a0cm) refractor transferred from the Dunecht observatory near Aberdeen. Only remnants of these two domes remain today. The City Dome was built to house a 22-inch (56\u00a0cm) refractor. This did not perform very well and was dismantled in 1926.
