Sometimes his name has even been rendered as Norbury, as in the edition of his episcopal register by Edmund Hobhouse.Hobhouse, p.242 However, the identification is no longer accepted as certain. Norbury is, in any case, a very common toponym: even within Northburgh's diocese, there were several examples. Nothing definite is known of his background. He seems to have communicated in Norman French, which makes it likely, but still not certain, that he came from the landed class of French descent."]}, {"page": "Hobhouse", "response": ["*Edmund Hobhouse (1817\u20131904), bishop of Nelson, New Zealand, and an antiquary"]}, {"page": "Arthur Hobhouse, 1st Baron Hobhouse", "response": ["Born at Hadspen House, Somerset, Hobhouse was the fourth and youngest son of Henry Hobhouse, permanent under-secretary of state in the Home Office, by his wife Harriet, sixth daughter of John Turton of Sugnall Hall, Stafford.

He offered his services as an engineer and a land agent, played a role in public life and was involved in Nelson Anglican church affairs. No doubt this facilitated his being commissioned to design the Maori chapel at Wakapuaka. It is thought he may have been the first architect of the house begun by Bishop Edmund Hobhouse, Bishopdale.

With his immediate predecessor at St. Peter's, Walter Kerr Hamilton, and his immediate successor, Edmund Hobhouse, Mr. Adams was very intimate. He always took a deep interest in the welfare of the parish, and has left us an interesting memorial of his incumbency in his well-known Warnings of the Holy Week, a set of lectures preached at St. Peter's in Holy Week, 1842. In the spring of this year he went to Eton as one of the examiners for the Newcastle scholarship, and, while bathing there, was all but drowned, and caught a violent cold which, flying to his lungs, ultimately proved fatal. It was hoped that a few months of residence in a warm climate would restore his health, and he accordingly passed the winter of 1842 in Madeira. But the disease had gained too firm a hold to be checked, and he resigned his living, settling at Bonchurch, Isle of Wight. Here he passed the last few years of his life, busily engaged with his pen, and taking part in every effort to improve the spiritual condition of the neighbourhood. He was at Bonchurch acquainted with Elizabeth Missing Sewell. One of his last public acts was to lay the foundation-stone of the new church at Bonchurch; and a few months later his remains were laid in the churchyard of the old church, where, by a happy design, his grave has the \u2018shadow of the cross\u2019 ever resting upon it."]}, {"page": "Ilchester Nunnery", "response": ["*Alice Atteyerde, 1315Edmund Hobhouse, Calendar of the Register of John de Drokensford, 1309\u20131329 (Somerset Record Society, 1887), p. 93"]}, {"page": "Walter Hobhouse", "response": ["The second son of Bishop Edmund HobhouseNational Library of New Zealand he was born on 5 April 1862 and educated at Eton and New College, Oxford.
