Wood was a favourite to win the single scull at the Olympics, but lost the final by 1.7 seconds to Yuriy Tyukalov. Although he never offered it as an excuse, as a child, Wood had injured his arm which occasionally caused him distress while rowing including during the summer of 1952. This may have affected his performance at the games, but Wood also faced far stiffer competition than in the 1948 games, which were held shortly after the Second World War, and his main rival Tyukalov would prove to be one of the best oarsmen of his generation."]}, {"page": "Wingfield Sculls", "response": ["|1951||\tTony Fox\t||Pembroke College, Cambridge||\t22.14\t||\tPutney to Mortlake", "|1952||\tTony Fox||London Rowing Club||\t24.33\t||\tPutney to Mortlake", "|1953|| Tony Fox||London Rowing Club||\t22.30\t||\tPutney to Mortlake"]}, {"page": "Diamond Challenge Sculls", "response": ["|1951 || Tony Fox || Pembroke College, Cambridge || E Larsen", "|1952 || Mervyn Wood || Sydney Rowing Club, Australia || Tony Fox", "|1953 || Tony Fox || London Rowing Club || R George", "|1956 || Teodor Kocerka || AZS Bydgoszsz, Poland || Tony Fox"]}, {"page": "List of people from Guernsey", "response": ["* Tony Fox (1928\u20132010), doctor and rower, represented Great Britain at the 1952 Summer Olympics and  at the 1956 Summer Olympics"]}, {"page": "John Marsden (rower)", "response": ["After the war, he returned to teach at Eton and in 1954 took over as Master in House from Harry Babington Smith.
