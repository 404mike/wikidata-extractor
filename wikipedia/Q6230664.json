Blakeley (1 October 1888 \u2013 20 February 1958) was a British film producer, director and screenwriter, the founder of Mancunian Films.\nBorn in Ardwick, Manchester, son of James Blakeley (born c. 1862; Manchester), and Margaret Quirk (born c. 1861; Glasgow, Scotland), he was of Lancashire (Church of England) descent on his father's side of the family and Irish Catholic on his mother's.  His father had become an early film distributor in 1908 after previous work as a travelling draper. Blakeley joined his father's business and soon came to understand the tastes of the emerging cinema audiences in the northern industrial towns. By the 1930s, the younger Blakeley was making films starring the idols of northern music hall comedy: George Formby, Frank Randle and Sandy Powell.\n\nInitially relying on studios in London, rising costs encouraged him to found the Mancunian Film Studios in his hometown in 1947. With \u00a370,000 capital, a former Methodist chapel on Dickenson Road in Rusholme was converted into a film studio. The studios produced a sequence of profitable films, often on shoestring budgets, until Blakeley's retirement in 1953. He died in Stockport aged 69.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Formby", "response": ["With Formby's growing success on stage, Beryl decided it was time for him to move into films. In 1934 she approached the producer Basil Dean, the head of Associated Talking Pictures (ATP). Although he expressed an interest in Formby, he did not like the associated demands from Beryl. She also met the representative of Warner Bros. in the UK, Irving Asher, who was dismissive, saying that Formby was \"too stupid to play the bad guy and too ugly to play the hero\". Three weeks later Formby was approached by John E. Blakeley of Blakeley's Productions, who offered him a one-film deal."]}, {"page": "Beryl Ingham", "response": ["In 1934, film producer John E. Blakeley, who had admired their double act, engaged them for work on a low-budget comic movie, Boots! Boots!, where Beryl\u2019s domineering manner on the set was noticed for the first time, especially by the teenage Betty Driver, with whom she feuded. In later films, producer Basil Dean avoided visiting the studio during filming, and director Monty Banks tried to get her banned from the set.

Blakeley in the 1930s as a vehicle for northern comedians such as George Formby and Frank Randle. The company opened its own studios in Manchester in 1947 and produced a successful sequence of films until Blakeley's retirement six years later. The studio was sold to the BBC in 1954, the same year that saw the advent of commercial television in the UK. The establishment of Granada Television based in the city attracted much of the production talent from the studios and continued Manchester's tradition of cultural innovation, often with its trademark social radicalism in its programming."]}, {"page": "Frank Randle", "response": ["On the outbreak of the Second World War, and having failed his medical to join the RAF, Randle joined the Home Guard and established a career in film.

Blakeley, the company produced films in London on extremely low budgets. Blakeley's first studio consisted of a single soundstage in a loft space above a taxi garage. Whenever the filmmakers wanted to shoot a scene, they would first have to signal the mechanics below to stop working, so the noise from below wouldn't register on the soundtracks. Blakeley's first production was Boots! Boots! (1934), starring the young variety entertainer George Formby. Production values were so low that some scenes were filmed in semi-darkness, to hide the lack of set decorations. Despite the technical flaws, the debut film was a huge success in the local provinces, recouping Blakeley's investment several times over and launching George Formby as Britain's leading screen comedian. Within the year \"Blakeley's Productions, Ltd.\" had become \"The Mancunian Film Distributors, Ltd\".
