He played as a forward.\nJones was born in Walsall, Staffordshire. His scoring rate of a goal every other game for Barnsley, his first professional club, prompted First Division club Birmingham to pay \u00a3170 for his services in May 1905. However, he found himself unable to dislodge the established forwards, Billy Jones, Benny Green and Arthur Mounteney, and played only five games before moving on to fellow First Division club Notts County. Jones scored six goals in 22 league games for County, his last Football League club.Jones died in Yorkshire in 1954.", "link_mentions": {}}}
