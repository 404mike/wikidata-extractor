The 1926\u201327 season was then his last at the club, as he led Bolton to fourth in the league, eight points behind leaders Newcastle United.

Following a 2\u20132 draw in Nottingham and a goalless game in Bolton, the Wanderers prevailed 1\u20130 in another close game held at Old Trafford.

A crowd estimated at up to 300,000 gained entrance and the terraces overflowed, with the result that many spectators found their way into the area around the pitch and even onto the playing area itself.  Mounted policemen, including one on a grey horse which became the defining photographic image of the day, had to be brought in to clear the crowds from the pitch and allow the match to take place.  The match began 45 minutes late as the vast crowd was shepherded by police to clear the pitch and stand around the perimeter. Although West Ham started strongly, Bolton proved the dominant team for most of the match and won 2\u20130. David Jack scored a goal two minutes after the start of the match and Jack Smith added a controversial second goal during the second half.  ", "West Ham began the second half as the stronger team, and Vic Watson received the ball in a good goalscoring position but mis-hit his shot. Eight minutes into the second half, Bolton added a second goal in controversial circumstances. Outside-forward Ted Vizard played the ball into a central position and Jack Smith hit the ball past Hufton. West Ham's players claimed that the ball had not entered the goal but rebounded into play from the goalpost, but referee D. H. Asson overruled them, stating that in his view the ball had entered the goal but then rebounded off a spectator. West Ham also claimed that Bolton had received an unfair advantage, as a Bolton fan at pitchside had kicked the ball towards Vizard, but Asson disregarded these claims as well and confirmed Bolton's second goal. At this point the crowd began to sense that Bolton would emerge victorious and many began heading towards the exits. Neither team had any more serious chances to score, and the remainder of the match was largely a stalemate with little inspired play. Late in the game, West Ham captain George Kay attempted to persuade Asson to abandon the match, but Bolton captain Joe Smith reportedly replied \"We're doing fine, ref, we'll play until dark to finish the match if necessary\". The score remained 2\u20130 to Bolton until the final whistle.  The King presented the FA Cup trophy to Joe Smith and then left the stadium to cheers from the crowd. West Ham trainer Charlie Paynter attributed his team's defeat to the damage the pitch had suffered before kick-off, saying \"It was that white horse thumping its big feet into the pitch that made it hopeless. Our wingers were tumbling all over the place, tripping up in great ruts and holes\".", "|FW || || Jack Smith"]}]}}
