In 1642, as preparations for war were made, Parliament surveyed the capabilities of the trained bands and documented that Bromsgrove had a store of munitions including 10 barrels of powder. The Royalists occupied the county in late 1642 following the Battle of Edgehill. In February 1643, Charles I ordered that Bromsgrove's vicar John Hall be removed from his post as a rebel.; ", "Disputes about the vicarage continued through the Interregnum and Protectorate. John Hall was vicar again until 1652. John Hall's successor John Spilsbury, previously a fellow of Magdalen College, was unpopular with some of Bromsgrove's churchgoers, who attempted unsuccessfully to eject him. Spilsbury was removed after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, and left the Church of England by refusing to conform to the Act of Uniformity See footnote along with around 2,000 other Anglican ministers from the Commonwealth period. He was confined to his house, banished from the county and finally imprisoned for his non-conformism.; see also  The toll on his health may have led to ill health and his death. He did return to Bromsgrove, where he was annually visited by Hall's son, an Anglican bishop. He was licensed as a Congregationalist teacher in 1672 in Bromsgrove and died in 1699.

He was educated at the King's School, Worcester, under Henry Bright, one of the most celebrated schoolmasters of the day. In 1624 he entered Balliol College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner. Finding himself under 'a careless tutor,' he moved to the newly founded Pembroke College as a pupil of Thomas Lushington. He graduated B.A. on 7 February 1629. Returning to Worcestershire, he became teacher of a private school, and preached in the chapels of several hamlets in the parish of Kings Norton, of which his brother, John Hall, vicar of Bromsgrove, was perpetual curate. At this period he conformed, but attendance at the puritan lecture, maintained at Birmingham, contributed to make him a presbyterian. He became curate at Kings Norton under his brother, who soon resigned the living in his favour. The living was of little value, but Hall obtained the mastership of the grammar school, founded by Edward VI.", "John Hall (1633\u20131710), Bishop of Bristol, was his nephew."]}, {"page": "Thomas Gilbert (minister)", "response": ["Gilbert did not again take charge of a congregation.

Wood calls him \u2018the common epitaph-maker for dissenters;\u2019 Calamy says he wrote but three, for Thomas Goodwin, D.D., John Owen, D.D., and Ichabod Chauncey. When Calamy was at Oxford (1691\u20132), he found Gilbert regularly attending the ministry of John Hall (1633\u20131710), bishop of Bristol and master of Pembroke, for one of the Sunday services, and for the other that of Joshua Oldfield at the Presbyterian meeting, an example followed by other Oxford dissenters. He was on intimate terms with Hall, Bathurst, master of Trinity, Aldrich, Wallis, and Jane.
