He made his professional debut at the age of nine or 10, achieved widespread fame in his mid teens as British boxing's 'Wonderboy', then retired from pro boxing at age 17.\nRenowned sportswriter Frank Butler heralded Daly 'the best young prospect we ever had'. He is probably the youngest boxer ever to make The Ring magazine's top-ten world ratings, and it is thought that he is also the youngest-ever professional boxer.", "link_mentions": {}}}
