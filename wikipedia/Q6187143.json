When asked about the core message of the song, Sigismondi wrote in an email to The Fader, \"I like the idea of something beautiful and dark living simultaneously in the same place, 'Without Love' has those themes. There are also themes of losing yourself, being told how to be, what to say ('tell me what to spit'). The garden vines are a metaphor for this.\"- -  She wrote that she was inspired for this video by the works of the ceramic artist Jessica Cooper."]}]}}
