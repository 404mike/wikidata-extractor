He also took six for 44 against Surrey, six for 63 against Cambridgeshire and five for 59 against the South of England. He took five wickets in an innings nine times, and twice claimed ten wickets in a match. A poor right-handed batsman, Hodgson scored 329 runs at 7.47, with a top score of 32 against the South of England.\n\"Yorkshire\", said Richard Daft some years after Hodgson's death, \"has always been rich in bowlers, and one of the best was Ike Hodgson. [Wilfred] Rhodes somewhat reminds me of him. Hodgson was perhaps a trifle faster, but he also used to bowl good slows with a break. He had a very good-natured grin, and I remember once that when at Bradford (August, 1864) he got me stumped by Ned Stephenson when I had made 80, he consoled me with a smile which was broad enough to put any man in a good humour.\"Hodgson was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, England, where he died just past his 39th birthday. It is believed that there exists an epitaph on his Bradford gravestone:\n\nIsaac Hodgson, rest his soul,\nCould never bat but always bowl.\nThrough many years the tourists' skill\nWas subjugate to Ikey's will.\nThey took their stance with vain defiance\nAgainst his subtle skill and science.\nProgenitor, great Almus Pater,\nBowler divine, but batting hater.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hodgson", "response": ["* Isaac Hodgson (architect) (born 1826), Irish-US architect", "* Isaac Hodgson (1828\u20131867), English cricketer"]}]}}
