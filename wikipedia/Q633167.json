In the absence of a verbatim report, differing perceptions are difficult to judge fairly; Huxley wrote a detailed account for Darwin, a letter which does not survive; however, a letter to his friend Frederick Daniel Dyster does survive with an account just three months after the event.Huxley to Dr FD Dyster, 9 September 1860, Huxley Papers 15.117. p. 118.

The mineral was discovered in Rakwana, Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka. Baddeley was a superintendent of a railroad project in Rakwana. As redacted by J. J. H. Teall, Director of the British Geological Survey in the early 1900s, Baddeleyite was discovered thanks to the discovery of Geikielite. Baddeley happened to send specimens of several pebbles to the Museum of Practical Geology in London, where Mr. Pringle examined them and attempted to classify them. According to Teall, the specimens were submitted to him by Pringle after he failed to assign them and compare them to other species, such as spinel, ilmenite, and so on. After analyzing the specimens, Teall concluded that the mineral was mainly composed of titanic acid and magnesia, with a very small percentage of protoxide of iron. Geikielite has the composition of MgTiO3. Concluding the various analyses, Teall and Pringle decided to name the new mineral Geikielite, taking the name after the Director General of the Geological Survey, Sir Archibald Geikie. Baddeley then decided to send more specimens to Teall in order to determine a proper specimen to be put in display at the Museum of Practical Geology. While trying to find the best specimen for display, as Teall relates, he noticed that one of the specimens was different from the rest. This new mineral as described was black in color, with a submetallic lustre and a hardness of 6.5. After analyzing the mineral, it was determined that its composition was not MgTiO3, as geikielite's, but it was ZrO2. Teall proposed that the new mineral should be named baddeleyite, after Joseph Baddeley to honor the man who brought two new minerals to notice."]}, {"page": "Wollaston Medal", "response": ["*1895 Archibald Geikie"]}, {"page": "Haslemere", "response": ["* Archibald Geikie (1834-1924) \u2013 geologist, retired to Haslemere in 1913"]}, {"page": "James Croll", "response": ["This led to a position in the Edinburgh office of the Geological Survey of Scotland, as keeper of maps and correspondence, where the director, Sir Archibald Geikie, encouraged his research.
