Two albums of his photographs survive documenting the town of Berkhamsted. These form one of the earliest documentary records of English village life. Amongst his pictures are a number of photographs of young girls which were sold at Sotheby's in 1984 described as \"in the style of Lewis Carroll\". There is evidence that he may have visited Christ Church, Oxford in the mid-1850s where Lewis Carroll was professor of mathematics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of photographers", "response": ["* William Clarridge"]}, {"page": "Clarridge, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Clarridge"]}]}}
