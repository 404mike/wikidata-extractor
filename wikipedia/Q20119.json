In the editorial, she was described using the conflating racalist phrase: \"The tall strength and pride of movement of a Masai Warrior\", which was picked up in an article by the Sarasota Herald Tribune, who finding the language deeply prejudiced and racialized, explored the work prospects of African-American women.Judy Stone, \"Luna, Who Dreamed of Being Snow White\", The New York Times, May 19, 1968.Time (magazine) In the same month, Luna received news of her father's death but decided to not return home for the funeral. Around this time, Luna also began having problems with Avedon. In an interview with an Italian magazine in 1975, she recalled that \"The more successful she became, the more controlling and possessive her fashion-photographer-manager became\".Panorama Magazine, 1975", "Avedon (who had moved over to the American Vogue in 1966) requested Luna again for a shoot around Northern Japan featuring furs, he told Doon Arbus he had requested her specifically because of his association with her as an \"extenuated black girl\" given \"there was no way of not being reminded of Egypt and not being reminded of Watusis and Africans\", deftly conflating African culture and employing the prescribed primitive racial script of the exotic black model which Luna had been portrayed in her shoots with him in Harper's Bazaar which compared Luna to an animal as she was dressed in animal print. Diana Vreeland, along with Alexey Brodovitch, stopped Avedon from using Luna as the only model in the shoot and suggested Veruschka instead for the 27-page Great Fur Caravan shoot published in October 1966.thumb|ABC Jean Shrimpton \"Ironically, in 1966 [American] Vogue named Donyale Luna 'The Model of the Year'.\"Work!

Sanders, Jet, June 16, 1966, p. 28.", "As for the United States, \"until the advent of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s the fashion industry operated its own kind of apartheid, which entirely excluded non-white models from its magazines, advertising and catwalk shows.\" Luna could work alongside models like Jean Shrimpton and Veruschka and command the same salary, but was thought of as exotic, becoming a victim of Othering (also see Dominance hierarchy) first by white then later the black community; compounded as both the \"girl-next-door\" and \"exotic\" negro model type.Fashioning Models:Image, Text and Industry, Joanne Entwistle, Elizabeth Wissinger, 2012 With the advent of the civil rights movement in the United States 'so too did society's fascination with the \"exotic\" and \"alien\". ... Almost against her own will, she became a symbol. Some people declared her a Masai warrior, Gauguinesque, Nefertiti reborn. Others claimed she was another species entirely - or from outer space!'. Time in 1966 called her a 'creature of contrasts. One minute sophisticated, the next fawnlike, now exotic and faraway'. Racialist language such as being 'from outer space' was routinely used and was adopted by Luna in her Donyale character in a bid to overcome the boundaries this language created towards her as a black body in the American public eye, and evolved other time to accommodate this prejudiced language. She said in late 1966 to a reporter that \"Fashion photographers saw me as something different but I'm certain it has nothing to do with my color. I never think of myself as a brown girl\"."]}, {"page": "Gamine", "response": ["In many ways, the \"gamine look\" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: Jean Shrimpton (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the miniskirt in 1965; Twiggy (b.
