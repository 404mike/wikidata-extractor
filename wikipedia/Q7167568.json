On 29 August 1942, machine gun bullets and a bomb caused serious damage.  One resident, Claudette Mawby (a Hollywood child star as one of The Mawby Triplets), was killed when she was blown to the bottom of the building's lift shaft by the blast.  Most of the building's windows were shattered.  Brighton's worst air raid, on 25 May 1943, affected Marine Gate badly.  A large bomb passed through one adjacent building and exploded in another, just missing some workmen.  Soon afterwards, three bombs were aimed at the block.  One cut through the building at fourth-floor level, destroying three flats and leaving its fin stuck in the floor of one; a second bounced off a patch of wasteland and hit a house before cutting right through Marine Gate, exploding on the road outside; and the third broke every window when it exploded at the southeast corner at ground-floor level.  There was also fire damage from another explosion at the gasworks.  No residents died, but many were injured, and the artist Percy Shakespeare (who was serving in the Royal Navy and was based at HMS Vernon at nearby Roedean School) was killed as he walked past Marine Gate.  After this attack, all residents were evacuated and the building was left unrepaired.  Another raid on 23 February 1944 caused more damage: Marine Gate was hit by one of several bombs dropped that night."]}, {"page": "Shakespeare (surname)", "response": ["* Percy Shakespeare (1906\u20131943), British painter"]}]}}
