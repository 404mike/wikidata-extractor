Seven years later, the brothers sold The Observer to William Innell Clement, a newspaper proprietor who owned a number of publications. The paper continued to receive government subsidies during this period; in 1819, of the approximately 23,000 copies of the paper distributed weekly, approximately 10,000 were given away as \"specimen copies\", distributed by postmen who were paid to deliver them to \"lawyers, doctors, and gentlemen of the town.\"Dennis Griffiths (ed.), The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422\u20131992, London and Basingstoke: Macmillan, 1992, p. 159. Yet the paper began to demonstrate a more independent editorial stance, criticising the authorities' handling of the events surrounding the Peterloo Massacre and defying an 1820 court order against publishing details of the trial of the Cato Street Conspirators, who were alleged to have plotted to murder members of the Cabinet. The woodcut pictures published of the stable and hayloft where the conspirators were arrested reflected a new stage of illustrated journalism that the newspaper pioneered during this time."]}, {"page": "A Harlot's Progress", "response": ["On 22 June 1828, William Innell Clement published Harlot's Progress in columns on a single page of his newspaper Bell's Life in London #330."]}, {"page": "Before 1900s in comics", "response": ["* June 22: William Innell Clement publishes Hogarth's Harlot's Progress and Monkeyana, or the Gambler's Progress in columns with other drawings on a single page of his newspaper Bell's Life in London #330.", "* June 24: George Goodger publishes for his partner William Innell Clement Gallery of 140 Comicalities, a magazine of four pages of drawings, including narrative sequences in columns."]}, {"page": "John Easthope", "response": ["He purchased the Morning Chronicle from William Innell Clement in 1834 for \u00a316,500, and sold his interest in the paper on his retirement from parliament in 1847.

Bell sold it to William Innell Clement, owner of The Observer, in 1824 or 1825, and the paper swallowed up a competitor, Pierce Egan's Life in London and Sporting Guide. From 1824 to 1852 it was edited by Vincent George Dowling, \"during which time Bell's Life became Britain's leading sporting newspaper, without which no gentleman's Sunday was quite complete\".Tony Mason, \u2018Dowling, Vincent George (1785\u20131852)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 29 Dec 2007 Dowling's son, Frank Lewis Dowling, effectively edited the paper during the last year of his father's life, and succeeded him as editor from 1852 to 1867.

In 1817, a worsening illness led Perry to turn over the editorial duties to Black. As editor, Black maintained the paper's opposition to the Tory government of the time, condemning its handling of the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Yet he came out against Queen Caroline during her trial in 1820, a stance that precipitated a drop in the newspaper's circulation. Black remained as editor after the paper was purchased by William Innell Clement in 1821, though the paper continued to decline especially as it faced growing competition from The Times for whig subscribers."]}, {"page": "William Clement", "response": ["* William Innell Clement (1780\u20131852), English newspaper proprietor"]}, {"page": "John Wright (bookseller died 1844)", "response": ["Their financial differences produced a lasting enmity between Cobbett and Wright, which was embittered by another circumstance. On Cobbett's release from gaol in 1812 a statement appeared in The Times that he had sought to avoid imprisonment two years before by making his submission to government and offering to suppress the Weekly Register. Wright, who had been privy to Cobbett's overtures, and had endeavoured to dissuade him from them, was unjustly suspected of having betrayed them. The revelation was too damaging to be forgiven. In 1819, while in America, Cobbett published a savage attack on Wright in the Register, alleging that he had detected him falsifying his accounts and describing graphically \"the big round drops of sweat that in a cold winter's day rolled down the caitiff's forehead\" when his villainy was discovered. Wright obtained \u00a3500. damages against William Innell Clement, the bookseller, for publishing the libel, and when Cobbett returned to England he commenced proceedings against him also, and on 11 December 1820 obtained \u00a31,000 damages. cites The Times, 12 December 1820."]}, {"page": "Vincent George Dowling", "response": ["The son of Vincent Dowling (1756\u20131825), an Irish journalist and bookseller, and elder brother of Sir James Dowling and Alfred Septimus Dowling, he was born in London, and received his earlier education in Ireland.

Soon after he went to work for the newspaper The Star, and in 1809 transferred to The Day.
