In India, he was active in the conversion movement of Dalits\u2014so-called \"Untouchables\"\u2014initiated in 1956 by B. R. Ambedkar. He wrote more than 60 books, including compilations of his talks, and was described as \"one of the most prolific and influential Buddhists of our era,\" \"a skilled innovator in his efforts to translate Buddhism to the West,\" and as \"the founding father of Western Buddhism\" for his role in setting up what is now the Triratna Buddhist Community, but Sangharakshita was often regarded as a controversial teacher. He was criticised for having had sexual relations with Order members, which allegedly amounted to abuse and coercion.Sangharakshita retired formally in 1995 and in 2000 stepped down from the movement's ostensive leadership, but he remained its dominant figure and lived at its headquarters in Coddington, Herefordshire.The Triratna Order Office announced the death of Sangharakshita after a short illness on 30 October 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Schopenhauer", "response": ["* Sangharakshita, 2004, \"Schopenhauer and aesthetic appreciation.\""]}, {"page": "List of Buddhists", "response": ["* Sangharakshita (1925\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "2018", "response": ["** Sangharakshita, English Buddhist teacher and writer (b. 1925)"]}, {"page": "Tooting", "response": ["* Sangharakshita, writer, Buddhist commentator, and founder of the Triratna Buddhist Community, born Dennis Lingwood in Tooting."]}, {"page": "Buddhahood", "response": ["Sangharakshita also states that \"The first thing we have to understand\u2014and this is very important\u2014is that the Buddha is a human being.

In keeping with Buddhist traditions, it also pays attention to contemporary ideas, particularly drawn from Western philosophy, psychotherapy, and art.", "The founder, Sangharakshita, taught a system of practice emphasising five types of meditation. The first two according to his system ('integration' and 'positive emotion'), can be correlated to the traditional category of \"calming\" \"samatha\" practices, and the last two (spiritual death and spiritual rebirth) can be correlated to \"insight\" or \"vipassana\" practices. For those not ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order, the practices associated with the first two are emphasised, though the spirit of the last two is also taught. The five types of meditation correspond to five 'stages' of the spiritual life.", "# A unified Order. Unlike some sangha, the community does not propagate a monastic lineage. Sangharakshita devised a non-monastic ordination system, whilst also allowing the undertaking of the \"anagarika\" precept which enjoins celibacy. Identical ordination is open to both sexes. While the movement regards single-sex activities as important to spiritual growth, men and women are recognised as being equally able to practice and develop spiritually.", "As the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order, the community was founded in London in April 1967 by Sangharakshita. He had then recently returned to England after spending two decades as a Buddhist and monk in India, following demobilisation from the British army. He had been born in south London as Dennis Lingwood, in August 1925. He would lead the organisation until his formal retirement in 1995, and would continue to exert a decisive influence on its thinking and practices thereafter.", "In 1997, the responsibility for ordination and spiritual leadership passed to a \"preceptor's college\", based in Birmingham. In 2000, the first chair of a preceptor's council was chosen by Sangharakshita.

Critics pointed to writings by Sangharakshita, and his senior advisor Dharmachari Subhuti, which placed such emphasis on single-sex activities, and what the Triratna Buddhist Community calls \u201cspiritual friendship\u201d, that the potential for misunderstandings or inappropriate behaviour appeared to some to be inevitable.", "In an official biography of Sangharakshita, published in 1994, and reissued in 2009, Subhuti says: \u201cSangharakshita believes that men must break down their fear of homosexuality by facing the fact that there may be some element of sexual attraction towards their friends.\u201d", "The Guardian report also raised controversy over statements by Sangharakshita which it interpreted as adverse to women and the family. Expressing views found in Buddhist texts from their earliest times, he has argued, for example, that, at least in the early stages of their spiritual careers, men are more apt to commit themselves to the spiritual life than women. In 1986, he wrote that the couple and nuclear family can be sources of neurosis.", ":\"A couple consists, in fact, of two half-people, each of whom unconsciously invests part of his or her total being in the other: each is dependent on the other for the kind of psychological security that can be found, ultimately, only within oneself.\"(Sangharakshita, 1986, Alternative Traditions).", "Although scriptures and historians recognize that the Buddha himself had concerns over such issues, particularly after the birth of his son Rahula, when he left home convinced that \"family life was incompatible with the highest forms of spirituality\", critics cite Sangharakshita's conservative views as evidence that misogynystic attitudes persisted in the FWBO during the 1980s.", "In a 2009 interview with a member of the group, Sangharakshita replied to a question about sex between him and students: \u201cPerhaps in a very few cases they were not as willing as I had supposed at the time \u2013 that is possible.\" In reply to a follow-up question, he said: \"I did not regard myself as a teacher with a capital T.\u201d He added: \u201cI have had many, many human encounters, the great majority non-sexual, and most of those encounters, including the sexual ones, have been satisfactory for both parties. If there were any encounters that were not satisfactory for the other person, whether at the time or in retrospect, then that is a pity and I am truly sorry that that should be the case.\"", "In September 2016, BBC News reported that former members of the Triratna movement claimed that they had been subject to sexual abuse by Sangharakshita at the group's retreat centre in Norfolk. Following discussion on social media, another former member claimed that he had been groomed for sex by another senior member of the order at the group's centre in Croydon in 1980s when he was 16 years old.", "On 4 January 2017, following his treatment in hospital for pneumonia, Sangharakshita issued a statement expressing \u201cdeep regret for all the occasions on which I have hurt, harmed or upset fellow Buddhists, and ask for their forgiveness.\" On 19 January 2017, Triratna's leadership issued a statement in response to Sangharakshita\u2019s apology: \u201cConsideration of some aspects of Bhante [Sangharakshita]'s past has been difficult for some of us in the College, as it has been for many of our brothers and sisters in the Order and others associated with our community.
