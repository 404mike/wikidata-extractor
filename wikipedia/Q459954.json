Comedy, romance, and thrills are skilfully blended.\" Harrison's Reports wrote, \"Good melodramatic entertainment. Because of the novelty of the story, the interesting plot developments, and the expert direction by Alfred Hitchcock, one's attention is held from the beginning to the end.\" John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that it was \"rather exasperating and disappointing to me. It begins with a smart murder, but wanders off through the English rural landscape in a fashion so lacking in that sound common sense we like in our mysteries, or like to feel is there anyhow, that one's interest fades away.\""]}, {"page": "Toad of Toad Hall", "response": ["| Nova Pilbeam"]}, {"page": "1939 in film", "response": ["*Cheer Boys Cheer, starring Nova Pilbeam (GB)"]}, {"page": "1936 in film", "response": ["*Tudor Rose, starring Cedric Hardwicke, Nova Pilbeam, John Mills (GB)"]}, {"page": "1919 in film", "response": ["*November 15 \u2013 Nova Pilbeam, actress (died 2015)"]}, {"page": "Nova (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Nova Pilbeam (1919-2015), British actress"]}, {"page": "List of female movie actors by name: P\u2013Q", "response": ["*Nova Pilbeam (1919\u20132015)"]}, {"page": "The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)", "response": ["Bob and Jill Lawrence (Leslie Banks and Edna Best), a British couple on a trip to Switzerland with their daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam), befriend Frenchman Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay), who is staying at their hotel.
