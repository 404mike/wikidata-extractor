Other early SLR cameras were constructed, for example, by Louis van Neck (Belgium, 1889), Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer (England, 1894) and Max Steckelmann (Germany, 1896), and Graflex of the United States and Konishi in Japan produced SLR cameras as early as 1898 and 1907 respectively. These first SLRs were large format cameras.Rudolf Kingslake: The Photographic Manufacturing Companies of Rochester, New York, p. 21Konishi: Sakura Reflex Prano; source The Japanese Historical Camera, p. 5 While SLR cameras were not very popular at the time, they proved useful for some work. These cameras were used at waist level; the ground glass screen was viewed directly, using a large hood to keep out extraneous light. In most cases, the mirror had to be raised manually as a separate operation before the shutter could be operated."]}, {"page": "Royal Photographic Society", "response": ["*1896 \u2013  Thomas Rudolphus Dallmeyer"]}, {"page": "T.
