His works were confined to Northwest England.  Owen is best known for his collaboration with William Lever in the creation of the soap-making factory and associated model village at Port Sunlight in the Wirral Peninsula (then in Cheshire, now in Merseyside).  Here he designed the factory, many of the workers' houses, public buildings and the church.  Later Owen was joined by his son, Segar, as a partner.  On his own, or in partnership, Owen designed houses, churches, banks, public houses, an infirmary, a school, and a concert hall.", "link_mentions": {}}}
