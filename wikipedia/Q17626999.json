His works were confined to Northwest England.  Owen is best known for his collaboration with William Lever in the creation of the soap-making factory and associated model village at Port Sunlight in the Wirral Peninsula (then in Cheshire, now in Merseyside).  Here he designed the factory, many of the workers' houses, public buildings and the church.  Later Owen was joined by his son, Segar, as a partner.  On his own, or in partnership, Owen designed houses, churches, banks, public houses, an infirmary, a school, and a concert hall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Port Sunlight", "response": ["*William Owen (1846\u20131910), architect, collaborated in the construction of Port Sunlight"]}, {"page": "Parr Hall", "response": ["Parr Hall was designed by the local architect William Owen in 1895."]}, {"page": "William Owen", "response": ["William Owen may refer to:", "*William Owen (Oxford MP) (c. 1540\u20131580), MP for Oxford", "*Sir William Owen (Shrewsbury MP), MP for Shrewsbury, 1625\u20131628", "*Sir William Owen, 4th Baronet (c. 1697\u20131781), British Member of Parliament for Pembroke and Pembrokeshire", "*William Owen (Australian politician) (1815\u20131869), businessman and politician in South Australia, prominent Total Abstainer", "*William Owen (Wisconsin politician, born 1825) (1825\u20131894), member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1862) (1862\u2013?), Chirk F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131945), footballer who played for Stoke", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1906) (1906\u2013?), English football goalkeeper with Birmingham, Fulham and Coventry City", "*William Owen (priest) (died 1680), Welsh Anglican priest", "*William Owen (Royal Navy officer, born 1737) (1737\u20131778), British Royal Navy officer and settler of Campobello Island, Canada", "*William Owen (painter) (1769\u20131825), British portrait painter", "*William Owen (composer) (1814\u20131893), Welsh composer of hymn tunes, including Bryn Calfaria", "*Sir William Owen (New South Wales judge)  (1834\u20131912), Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales", "*William Owen (trade unionist) (1844\u20131912), English trade unionist, journalist and political activist", "*William Owen (architect) (1846\u20131910), English architect", "*Sir William Owen (judge) (1899\u20131972), Justice of the High Court of Australia, grandson of Sir William Owen of the Supreme Court of New South Wales", "*William Owens (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "List of British architects", "response": ["*William Owen (1846\u20131910)"]}, {"page": "All Saints Church, Thelwall", "response": ["The origins of a church or chapel at Thelwall are unclear.  It has been thought that a chapel was built by Richard Brooke of Norton Priory but a legal suit in 1663 suggests that there was a chapel on the site before this date.  At this time Thelwall was in the parish of Runcorn.  In 1663 the chapel on the site was restored by Robert Pickering.  After this the chapel fell into disrepair.  It was restored again and re-opened in 1782.  By the following century the church was too small for its congregation and in 1843 a new church was built and consecrated. This consisted of a nave which was designed by James Mountford Allen.  In 1856 the chancel was built at the expense of James Nicholson and the nave was extended by one bay.  In 1890 Henry Stanton commissioned a new north aisle, a new baptistry with a new font, and a new vestry.  The aisle and vestry, together with a north porch, were designed by William Owen."]}, {"page": "Big House, Landshipping", "response": ["The house was originally built in 1750 and owned by the   who were the Landshipping Coal Agents. It was constructed using stone and roof materials from an older, ruined inland mansion. This building would have been a simple rectangular design with an entrance facing south-west, before several alterations occurred. The final alterations occurred in 1830 by architect William Owen. Owen added a third storey to the western wing and moved the entrance to the North fa\u00e7ade, between two bows that were added at the same time to look out over the River Cleddau. His design was inspired by Slebech Hall and Picton Castle. The house remained occupied until the late 1800s when it fell into disrepair and by 1890 it was a ruin.  However, the cottages at the rear remained lived in until the 1970s. In 1922 the Landshipping Estate, including Big House, was sold at auction."]}, {"page": "Warrington", "response": ["*William Owen (1846 in Latchford \u2013 1910), architect who practised in Warrington, collaborated with William Lever in the creation of Port Sunlight"]}, {"page": "Listed buildings in Port Sunlight", "response": ["The model village of Port Sunlight was developed by William Lever (later 1st Viscount Leverhulme) to provide housing for the workers in the nearby soap-making factory of Lever Brothers.
