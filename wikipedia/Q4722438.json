He was the elder brother of the double-bass player Claude Hobday.\n\nHobday studied violin and viola at the Royal College of Music in London with Henry Holmes, and he was one of the college's earliest graduates on viola. He played in several leading string quartet musical ensembles, notably at St James's Hall, with Joseph Joachim, Lady Hall\u00e9, Ries and the cellist Alfredo Piatti. He also gave many viola recitals with his wife, the pianist Ethel Sharpe, later known as Ethel Hobday.\nMuch of Hobday's career was spent as an orchestral musician. In 1895 he became principal viola in Queen Victoria's private band and was awarded the Diamond Jubilee medal and Coronation medal for services as part of that group.  Hobday was solo viola at the Royal Covent Garden Opera from 1900 to 1914. He was also the leading viola of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, of the Goossens Orchestra, of the London Symphony Orchestra from its inception in 1904 until 1930, and of the orchestras of the chief festivals. He soloed with orchestras on a few occasions, most notably in several performances of Hector Berlioz's Harold in Italy.Hobday premiered several works including Frank Bridge's Phantasy for Piano Quartet, Vaughan Williams' Four Hymns for Tenor, and String Orchestra and Vaughan Williams's Quintet in C Minor for Pianoforte, Violin, Viola, Violoncello, and Double Bass. The English composer Ernest Walker also composed works specifically for Hobday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of violists", "response": ["* Alfred Charles Hobday (1870\u20131942)"]}, {"page": "Hobday", "response": ["*Alfred Charles Hobday (1870\u20131942), English viola player"]}, {"page": "Ethel Hobday", "response": ["Ethel Hobday, n\u00e9e Sharpe (28 November 1872, Dublin \u2013 10 July 1947, Tankerton) was an Irish pianist, who became famous in chamber-music recitals especially in England, and was married to the violist Alfred Charles Hobday."]}, {"page": "Claude Hobday", "response": ["Claude Hobday was the younger brother of the violist Alfred Charles Hobday (1870\u20131942) and the brother-in-law of the pianist Ethel Hobday (n\u00e9e Sharpe)."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the Royal Academy of Music", "response": ["* Alfred Charles Hobday (violist)"]}]}}
