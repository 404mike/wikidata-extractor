In biology, he is known for the Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle, a basic principle of population genetics.\nG. H. Hardy is usually known by those outside the field of mathematics for his 1940 essay A Mathematician's Apology, often considered one of the best insights into the mind of a working mathematician written for the layperson.\n\nStarting in 1914, Hardy was the mentor of the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, a relationship that has become celebrated. Hardy almost immediately recognised Ramanujan's extraordinary albeit untutored brilliance, and Hardy and Ramanujan became close collaborators. In an interview by Paul Erd\u0151s, when Hardy was asked what his greatest contribution to mathematics was, Hardy unhesitatingly replied that it was the discovery of Ramanujan. In a lecture on Ramanujan, Hardy said that \"my association with him\nis the one romantic incident in my life\".:\u200a2\u200a\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arithmetic function", "response": [" \u00a0 \u00a0G.H.
