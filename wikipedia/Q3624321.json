Fox Strangways wrote music criticism for The Times, was chief music critic of The Observer, and founded the quarterly magazine Music and Letters.\nTogether with the tenor Steuart Wilson, Fox Strangways made English translations of the lieder of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Microtonal music", "response": ["Terminology other than \"microtonal\" has been used or proposed by some theorists and composers. In 1914, A. H. Fox Strangways objected that \"'heterotone' would be a better name for \u015bruti than the usual translation 'microtone'\". Modern Indian researchers yet write: \"microtonal intervals called shrutis\". In Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia in the 1910s and 1920s the usual term continued to be Viertelton-Musik (quarter tone music), and the type of intervallic structure found in such music was called the Vierteltonsystem, which was (in the mentioned region) regarded as the main term for referring to music with microintervals, though as early as 1908 Georg Capellan had qualified his use of \"quarter tone\" with the alternative term \"Bruchtonstufen (Viertel- und Drittelt\u00f6ne)\" (fractional degrees (quarter and third tones)). Despite the inclusion of other fractions of a whole tone, this music continued to be described under the heading \"Vierteltonmusik\" until at least the 1990s, for example in the twelfth edition of the Riemann Musiklexikon, and in the second edition of the popular Brockhaus Riemann Musiklexikon."]}, {"page": "Rabindra Sangeet", "response": ["For Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the Modern Review observed that \"[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ...
