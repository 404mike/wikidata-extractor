Furthermore, as three notes are needed to define any common chord, three is often taken as the minimum number of notes that form a definite chord. Hence, Andrew Surmani, for example, states, \"When three or more notes are sounded together, the combination is called a chord.\" George T. Jones agrees: \"Two tones sounding together are usually termed an interval, while three or more tones are called a chord.\" According to Monath, \"a chord is a combination of three or more tones sounded simultaneously\", and the distances between the tones are called intervals. However, sonorities of two pitches, or even single-note melodies, are commonly heard as implying chords. A simple example of two notes being interpreted as a chord is when the root and third are played but the fifth is omitted. In the key of C major, if the music stops on the two notes G and B, most listeners hear this as a G major chord."]}, {"page": "Music for 18 Musicians", "response": ["In a review of the 1978 release, AllMusic wrote that \"when this recording was released in 1978, the impact on the new music scene was immediate and overwhelming. Anyone who saw potential in minimalism and had hoped for a major breakthrough piece found it here. The beauty of its pulsing added-note harmonies and the sustained power and precision of the performance were the music's salient features; and instead of the sterile, electronic sound usually associated with minimalism, the music's warm resonance was a welcome change.\" Reviewing the 1978 LP in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote of Music for 18 Musicians: \"In which pulsing modules of high-register acoustic sound\u2014the ensemble comprises violin, cello, clarinet, piano, marimbas, xylophone, metallophone, and women's voices\u2014evolve harmonically toward themselves. Very mathematical, yet also very, well, organic\u2014the duration of particular note-pulses is determined by the natural breath rhythms of the musicians\u2014this sounds great in the evening near the sea.\" Critic Edward Strickland argues that Music for 18 Musicians is \"the high point of ensemble music of the 1970s by composers identified as Minimalist\".
