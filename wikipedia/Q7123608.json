When Martin Curry was fouled in the area for a penalty, goalkeeper McGee stepped up to blast the sliotar into the back of the net and give his side a boost. The Antrim side then closed the gap between the two sides even further after Ben O'Connor missed a straightforward free while at the other end Paddy Richmond slotted over another point for the Northerners to reduce the deficit to two points. The match was as close as Dunloy were to come as Ben O'Connor, Andy O'Brien and James Bowles all found their range to put Newtown six points ahead before Jerry O'Connor claimed the score of the afternoon as he burst through on a fine solo run. Ben O'Connor increased his personal tally to ten points, while Alan T. O'Brien put the icing on the cake, and his third of the game was to be the final point."]}, {"page": "2006 Christy Ring Cup Final", "response": ["Antrim got off to a flying start with a flurry of goals putting them 3-6 to no score clear.
