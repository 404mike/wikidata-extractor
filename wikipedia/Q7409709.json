His career began in his native Scotland with Kirkintilloch Rob Roy, where he was spotted by Bob Jack. He moved to Devon in 1924 and became an instant favourite with the club's supporters. His goalscoring ability made him stand out from other wingers and his partnership with inside left Jack Leslie became legendary, as the club challenged for promotion to the First Division during the 1930s. Nicknamed The Mighty Atom, Black was known to play with a cigarette stub tucked behind his ear. He ended his career with Queens Park Rangers and returned to Plymouth during the war to work in the Royal Naval Armaments Depot. He was inducted into the Plymouth Argyle Hall of Fame in 2004.", "link_mentions": {}}}
