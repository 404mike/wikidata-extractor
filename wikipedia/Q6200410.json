After the Banned dissolved, Hughes joined Cowboys International, forming a rhythm section with drummer Terry Chimes, formerly of the Clash, together playing on the album The Original Sin in 1979, and the subsequent tours, television and radio appearances of the band. After a final TV appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test (22 January 1980), Hughes left Cowboys International and joined Nick Kent's group The Subterraneans, subsequently appearing on their only single \"My Flamingo\" which was released in early 1981.\nIn 1980, having turned down audition requests from Woody Woodmansey, Alex Chilton's Big Star, and Marco Pirroni of Adam and the Ants, he joined Ian Broudie's band Original Mirrors, playing on an album and two singles including \"Dancing with the Rebels\". In 1981, he joined Department S, in time to play on their unreleased album Sub-Stance, produced by David Tickle.\nHughes' subsequent work includes taking part in the first rock tour of the Middle East with the theatre rock band Famous Names; guesting on tracks for the rockabilly band Whirlwind; Alan Wilder's solo album Hydrology Parts 1 and 2; as writer and performer on Paradise Now for the Norwegian rock band Oceans Apart; television appearances with La Toya Jackson; and playing with a diverse range of musicians including Mick Jagger, Jeff Beck, members of Cameo, Black, Greg Phillinganes, and Omar Hakim.\nHughes' own band Boardwalk Isabella released the Clear the Decks EP in 2015 and the single \"Freedom (Step Up My Desire)\" in 2016.\nHughes is reportedly addicted to bourbon biscuits.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Jimmy Hughes (The Banned, Cowboys International, Original Mirrors, Department S)"]}, {"page": "Wonderful Life (Black song)", "response": ["*Jimmy Hughes \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Wonderful Life (Black album)", "response": ["* Jimmy Hughes \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "James Hughes", "response": ["* Jimmy Hughes (footballer) (1909\u20131966), English footballer", "* Jimmy Hughes (British musician) (born 1958), British punk rock/New Wave bassist", "* Jimmy Hughes (singer) (born 1938), American soul singer", "* Jimmy Hughes, Rookie Cop, American television show (1953)"]}, {"page": "Tommy Steel (bassist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Hughes (British musician)"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Hughes (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Hughes (British musician)"]}, {"page": "Today Today (song)", "response": ["* Jimmy Hughes\u00a0\u2013 Bass"]}, {"page": "Sweetest Smile", "response": ["* Jimmy Hughes \u2013 drums"]}]}}
