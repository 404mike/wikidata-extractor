He was trained in Lancaster and practised throughout his career from an office in Chester. Initially he ran the practice on his own, but from 1884 until two years before his death he worked in partnerships with two of his former assistants.\nDouglas's output included new churches, restoring and renovating existing churches, church furnishings, new houses and alterations to existing houses, and a variety of other buildings, including shops, banks, offices, schools, memorials and public buildings. His architectural styles were eclectic. Douglas worked during the period of the Gothic Revival, and many of his works incorporate elements of the English Gothic style. He was also influenced by architectural styles from the mainland of Europe and included elements of French, German and Dutch architecture. However he is probably best remembered for his incorporation of vernacular elements in his buildings, in particular half-timbering, influenced by the black-and-white revival in Chester. Other vernacular elements he incorporated include tile-hanging, pargeting, and the use of decorative brick in diapering and the design of tall chimney stacks. Of particular importance is Douglas's use of joinery and highly detailed wood carving.\nThroughout his career he attracted commissions from wealthy landowners and industrialists, especially the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall. Most of his works have survived, particularly his churches. The city of Chester contains a number of his structures, the most admired of which are his half-timbered black-and-white buildings and Eastgate Clock. The highest concentration of his work is found in the Eaton Hall estate and the surrounding villages of Eccleston, Aldford and Pulford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1911", "response": ["* May 23\u00a0\u2013 John Douglas, English architect (b. 1830)"]}, {"page": "Douglas (surname)", "response": ["* John Douglas (Scottish architect) (died 1778)", "* John Douglas (architect) (1830\u20131911), English architect", "* David John Douglass, political writer", "* John Douglas (bishop of Salisbury) (1721\u20131807), Scottish man of letters and Anglican bishop", "* John Douglas (drummer) (born 1973), drummer for English band Anathema", "* Michael Keaton, born Michael John Douglas (born 1951), American actor", "* Sir John Douglas (died 1814), Royal Marine officer", "*General Sir John Douglas of Glenfinart (1817\u20131888), Commander of the troops in the North British District", "* Admiral Peter John Douglas (1787\u20131858), British naval officer", "* John Douglas, 2nd Earl of Morton (died 1513)", "* John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry (1779\u20131856), younger brother of the 6th Marquess of Queensberry", "* John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry (1844\u20131900), Scottish nobleman", "* John Douglas, 21st Earl of Morton (1927\u20132016), grandson of the 19th Earl of Morton", "* John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie (c. 1433 \u2013 1463),  son of James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas ", "* Henry John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Beaulieu 1832=1905 ", "* John Douglas Sr. (born c. 1636), Maryland, US, politician", "* John Douglas (died 1838) (c. 1774 \u2013 1838), MP for Orford and Minehead, England", "* Sir John Douglas, 3rd Baronet of Kelhead (c. 1708 \u2013 1778), MP for Dumfriesshire", "* John Douglas (Queensland politician) (1828\u20131904), Premier of Queensland, Australia", "* John Douglas of Broughton (died 1832), Scottish politician", "* John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu (1826\u20131929), a British Conservative politician", "* John Douglas (rugby player) (born 1934)", "* John Douglas (sportsman) (born 1951), Australian footballer and cricketer", "* John Douglas (archbishop of St Andrews) (c. 1494 \u2013 1574) ", "* John Douglas (bishop of Salisbury) (1721\u20131807), Scottish man of letters and Anglican bishop"]}, {"page": "Aldford", "response": ["Most of the building stock was constructed as a designed village in the middle of the 19th century by Sir Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, in almost rectangular form.
