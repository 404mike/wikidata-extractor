Wendy Schmalz, for Publishers Weekly, was particularly effusive, stating \"it's a riveting story that many readers will finish in one sitting\", finding that \"each chapter is a surprise, and the tension builds steadily until the inevitable climactic face-off.\" Erin Wyatt, for VOYA magazine, found it to be a \"plot-driven, page-turning thriller\", stating that \"Henry provides just enough detail to provide depth and complexity to the characters\" and that \"the suspense builds to a fever pitch near the end of the book.\" Traci Glass, for School Library Journal, called the novel a \"fast-paced, gripping thriller\" and that \"fans of intense page-turners and those who liked Michele Jaffe's Rosebush or Lucy Christopher's Stolen will love this one.\" Tempering this a little, Glass also found that \"the ending comes a little too fast and is too neatly tied up\", though does find that, despite this, \"Gabie is an intriguing protagonist.\" Kirkus Reviews offered a more critical viewpoint, stating that they found that the way the novel is written, including various police reports and interviews and varying character view-points, to \"add interest and texture to what otherwise would be a straight genre tale\". They found that \"the police seem amazingly obtuse, Gabie's belief that Kayla is alive is given no realistic, clue-based hook and the third quarter [of the novel] has some pacing problems\"; however also that \"Gabie and Drew's budding relationship is believable, and it has a strong wingding climax followed by a feel-good ending\"; concluding that the novel is \"unexceptional but solid.\""]}, {"page": "Inky Awards", "response": ["|Lucy Christopher"]}]}}
