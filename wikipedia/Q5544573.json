He served an apprenticeship at Penn's Engineering Works in Greenwich and in 1869 he moved to Coventry to work at the Coventry Machinist Company. Around 1874 he started his own company to manufacture cycles, Singer & Co, in 1894 that became Singer & Co Ltd, and in 1896 the Singer Cycle Company, that soon grew into a large business and also in 1896, at the height of popularity for cycles, he floated his business as a company with a capital of \u00a3700,000 reverting to Singer & Co Ltd. The development of forks with curves is attributed to him.\n\nSinger was elected to the Coventry city council in 1881; he became an alderman in 1893 and also served as Mayor of Coventry from 1891 to 1894. He resigned from the council in 1898 as his interests were more with philanthropy and charity than politics.Singer died on 4 January 1909, aged 62 at his home at Coundon Court near Coventry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of companies named after people", "response": ["* Singer Motors \u2013 George Singer"]}, {"page": "Singer Motors", "response": ["Singer Motors Limited was a British motor vehicle manufacturing business, originally a bicycle manufacturer founded as Singer & Co by George Singer, in 1874 in Coventry, England.

Stanley convened a meeting at the Lord Aylesford Inn in Hillfields, with colleagues from the factory in Canterbury Street including \"Little Harry\" Banks, George Bowers, Harry Hathaway, \"Cock\" Heath, Frank Moseley, Andrew Poole, and \"Shiner\" Turner. The club's first headquarters was the White Lion in Gosford Green and they began playing matches at pitch in Stoke called Dowells Field. The Singers Cycle Company founder, George Singer, became the first president of the club. Singers played around forty games in their first four years, which were basic in nature, lacking a regular playing staff and sometimes missing equipment such as goal nets. They joined the Birmingham County Football Association and the played opponents from across the Midlands including Hinckley, Langley Green and Small Heath. Admission to the games was free at that time, and players covered their own expenses.", "Despite a slump in form as a result of losing their best players, Singers continued to develop administratively through the 1890s. The club became professional in 1892 but the status was largely symbolic as many players remained amateur and the professionals only received expenses and match fees. It was still a \"shop club\" which meant that only Singers factory employees were permitted to play. They entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1892 and began to play a full league fixture list from 1894, competing in the Birmingham and District League with games against the strong reserve sides of established Midlands clubs including Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion. There was a perennial proposal through the decade to change the club's name, given the growing support from Coventry residents not connected with the cycle factory. Club president George Singer, who was also mayor of Coventry in the early 1890s, favoured calling the club after the city but there was insufficient support within the club administration. The proposal finally gained the necessary support in 1898 as another slump in the factory's fortunes highlighted the desirability of distancing the football team from the company. Despite a last-minute objection from Coventry Rugby Club, who felt that the name was too similar to their own, the name change to Coventry City Football Club was approved by the Football Association (FA) on 12 August 1898."]}, {"page": "George Singer", "response": ["*Elements of Electricity and Electro-chemistry by George Singer, 1814, from the Internet Archive"]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Coventry", "response": ["* 1891\u201394 George Singer (founder of Singer Cycle Company)"]}]}}
