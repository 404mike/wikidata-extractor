Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks: \"Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western \u2013 everyone wears a cowboy hat \u2013 is a comedy conversation piece.

His heroism on-screen and devotion to his family made him relatable and representative of the American ideal, leading Stewart to be considered one of the best-loved figures in twentieth-century American popular culture. According to film scholar Dennis Bingham, \"his ability to 'play'\u2014even symbolize\u2014honesty and 'American ideals' made him an icon into whose mold later male stars tried to pour themselves.\" Similarly, film scholar James Naremore has called Stewart \"the most successful actor of the 'common man' in the history of movies\" and \"the most intensely-emotional leading man to emerge from the studio system,\" who could cry on screen without losing his masculinity. David Thomson has explained Stewart's appeal by stating that \"we wanted to be him, and we wanted to be liked by him,\" while Roger Ebert has stated that \"whether he played everyman, or everyman's hidden psyche, Stewart was an innately likable man whose face, loping gait and distinctive drawl became famous all over the world.\" Among Stewart's most recognizable qualities was his manner of speaking with a hesitant drawl. According to film scholar Tim Palmer, \"Stewart's legacy rests on his roles as the nervous idealist standing trial for, and gaining stature from, the sincerity of his beliefs, while his emotive convictions are put to the test.\" Film critic David Ansen wrote about Stewart's appeal as a person in addition to his appeal as an actor.

She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting\u2014and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do\". In contrast, Peter Bradshaw wrote that Monroe was a talented comedian who \"understood how comedy achieved its effects\", and Roger Ebert wrote that \"Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on the screen was magical\". Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that \"she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material\" and that \"the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart\"."]}, {"page": "Marlon Brando", "response": ["In the A&E Biography episode on Brando, biographer Peter Manso comments, \"On the one hand, being a celebrity allowed Marlon to take his revenge on the world that had so deeply hurt him, so deeply scarred him.

Another book critical of Scott, David Thomson's Scott's Men, was released in 1977. In Thomson's view, Scott was not a great man, \"at least, not until near the end\"; his planning is described as \"haphazard\" and \"flawed\", his leadership characterised by lack of foresight. Thus by the late 1970s, in Jones's words, \"Scott's complex personality had been revealed and his methods questioned\"."]}, {"page": "Cary Grant", "response": ["In 1940, Grant played a callous newspaper editor who learns that his ex-wife and former journalist, played by Rosalind Russell, is to marry insurance officer Ralph Bellamy in Hawks' comedy His Girl Friday, which was praised for its strong chemistry and \"great verbal athleticism\" between Grant and Russell. Grant reunited with Irene Dunne in My Favorite Wife, a \"first rate comedy\" according to Life magazine, which became RKO's second biggest picture of the year, with profits of $505,000. After playing a Virginian backwoodsman in the American Revolution-set The Howards of Virginia, which McCann considers to have been Grant's worst film and performance, his last film of the year was in the critically lauded romantic comedy The Philadelphia Story, in which he played the ex-husband of Hepburn's character. Grant felt his performance was so strong that he was bitterly disappointed not to have received an Oscar nomination, especially since both his lead co-stars, Hepburn and James Stewart, received them, with Stewart winning for Best Actor. Grant joked \"I'd have to blacken my teeth first before the Academy will take me seriously\". Film historian David Thomson wrote that \"the wrong man got the Oscar\" for The Philadelphia Story and that \"Grant got better performances out of Hepburn than her (long-time companion) Spencer Tracy ever managed.\"Thomson, David, A Biographical Dictionary of Film, Martin Secker and Warburg Ltd, London, 1994, pg. 301.

Grant's not being nominated for His Girl Friday the same year is also a \"sin of omission\" for the Oscars.", "Stirling refers to Grant as \"one of the shrewdest businessmen ever to operate in Hollywood\". His long-term friendship with Howard Hughes from the 1930s onward saw him invited into the most glamorous circles in Hollywood and their lavish parties. Biographers Morecambe and Stirling state that Hughes played a major role in the development of Grant's business interests so that by 1939, he was \"already an astute operator with various commercial interests\". Scott also played a role, encouraging Grant to invest his money in shares, making him a wealthy man by the end of the 1930s. In the 1940s, Grant and Barbara Hutton invested heavily in real estate development in Acapulco at a time when it was little more than a fishing village, and teamed up with Richard Widmark, Roy Rogers, and Red Skelton to buy a hotel there. Behind his business interests was a particularly intelligent mind, to the point that his friend David Niven once said: \"Before computers went into general release, Cary had one in his brain\". Film critic David Thomson believes that Grant's intelligence came across on screen, and stated that \"no one else looked so good and so intelligent at the same time\".", "Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the \"greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known\". Schickel stated that there are \"very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order\" and thought that he was the \"best star actor there ever was in the movies\". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him \"the only actor I ever loved in my whole life\", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Pauline Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately because he \"embodies what seems a happier time\u2212a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer\"."]}, {"page": "Ingrid Bergman", "response": ["Intermezzo became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. Ratoff, said, \"She is sensational.\" This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", wrote a retrospective, adding that workmen went out of their way to do things for her and that the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\". Film historian David Thomson notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to Life, the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\". Selznick appreciated her uniqueness. Bergman was hailed as a fine new talent, and received many positive reviews. The New York Times noted her \"freshness and simplicity and natural dignity\" and the maturity of her acting which was nonetheless, free of \"stylistic traits - the mannerisms, postures, precise inflections - that become the stock in trade of the matured actress.\" Variety noted that she was warm and convincing, and provided an \"arresting performance\" and that her \"charm, sincerity\" ...and \"infectious vivaciousness\" would \"serve her well in both comedy and drama.\" There was also recognition of her natural appearance, in contrast to other film actresses. The New York Tribune said: \"Using scarcely any makeup, but playing with mobile intensity, she creates the character so vividly and credibility that it becomes the core of [the] narrative\". Bergman made her stage debut in 1940 with Lilliom opposite Burgess Meredith, at a time when she was still learning English. Selznick was worried that his new starlet's value would diminish if she received bad reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times reviewed that Bergman seemed at ease, and commanded the stage that evening.

Her persona ate her alive.\" Her film roles often mirrored her personal life, and many critics continue to regard her as always playing herself, rather than acting. In contrast, Mel Gussow of The New York Times stated that \"the range of [Taylor's] acting was surprisingly wide\", despite the fact that she never received any professional training. Film critic Peter Bradshaw called her \"an actress of such sexiness it was an incitement to riot \u2013 sultry and queenly at the same time\", and \"a shrewd, intelligent, intuitive acting presence in her later years.\" David Thomson stated that \"she had the range, nerve, and instinct that only Bette Davis had had before \u2013 and like Davis, Taylor was monster and empress, sweetheart and scold, idiot and wise woman.\" Five films in which she starred \u2013 Lassie Come Home, National Velvet, A Place in the Sun, Giant, and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? \u2013 have been preserved in the National Film Registry, and the American Film Institute has named her the seventh greatest female screen legend of classical Hollywood cinema."]}, {"page": "Buster Keaton", "response": ["Film critic David Thomson later described Keaton's style of comedy: \"Buster plainly is a man inclined towards a belief in nothing but mathematics and absurdity ... like a number that has always been searching for the right equation.

Later in 1996, DiCaprio starred in Marvin's Room, a family drama revolving around two sisters, played by Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. DiCaprio portrayed Hank, Streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum.

For the same reason, he dropped out of the film Hobson's Choice (1954). Scheduled to play Willy Mossop, he was replaced by John Mills. Author David Shipman speculates that Donat's asthma may have been psychosomatic: \"His tragedy was that the promise of his early years was never fulfilled and that he was haunted by agonies of doubt and disappointment (which probably were the cause of his chronic asthma).\" David Thomson also suggested this explanation, and Donat himself thought that his illness had a 90% basis in his psychology.

Robin Wood noted, in his initial review of the film, reviewers tended to pile on the film, attempting to \"outdo [one an]other with sarcasm and contempt.\" Several members of the cast and crew have complained that the initial reviews of the film were tainted by its production history and that daily critics were reviewing it as a business story as much as a motion picture. In April 2011, the staff of Time Out London selected Heaven's Gate as the 12th greatest Western of all time. While Peter Biskind covered the many excesses and problems with the movie in his book Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, he also noted that Heaven's Gate was not dissimilar to other big-budget, troubled projects of the late 1970s and early 1980s (such as Steven Spielberg's 1941 and Warren Beatty's Reds), and that the backlash against Heaven's Gate could have easily been directed elsewhere.
