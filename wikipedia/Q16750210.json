Her sculptures were based on figuration and expressiveness and she often left traces of her working of the material in the finished piece, in contrast to the smooth abstract work of others. In 1953 and 1956 works by her were shown at the Beaux-Arts Gallery, London. In 1953 she was one of the twelve British artists included in the international competition for the monument to the Unknown Political Prisoner Competition. Her sculpture subjects included Sandor Vegh, Herbert Read, Helen Lessore and the artists Bernard Leach, Patrick Heron and Mary Fedden. Her sculpture Three-fold Head is in the Tate collection."]}]}}
