After his military service, he joined HM Diplomatic Service in 1955. His diplomatic career included posts in Indonesia, Italy, Poland, the Soviet Union, and a number of positions at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. From 1988 to 1992 Braithwaite was ambassador in Moscow, first of all to the Soviet Union and then to the Russian Federation. Subsequently, he was the Prime Minister's foreign policy adviser and chairman of the UK Joint Intelligence Committee (1992\u201393), and was awarded the GCMG in 1994.\nBraithwaite was married in April 1961 to the former Gillian Mary Robinson (15 September 1937 \u2013 10 November 2008 London), better known as the archaeologist and Roman face pottery expert Jill Braithwaite. They had several children, including three sons and one daughter - Richard, Katharine, Julian (whose twin brother, Mark, died in 1971) and David.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hafizullah Amin", "response": ["Concerned for his safety, on 20 December Amin moved from the Presidential Palace, located in the centre of Kabul, to the Tajbeg Palace, which had previously been the headquarters of the Central Corps of the Afghan Army. The palace was formidable, with walls strong enough to withstand artillery fire. According to Rodric Braithwaite, \"its defences had been carefully and intelligently organised\". All roads to the palace had been mined, with the exception of one, which had heavy machine guns and artillery positioned to defend it. To make matters worse for the Soviets, the Afghans had established a second line of defence which consisted of seven posts, \"each manned by four sentries armed with a machine gun, a mortar, and automatic rifles\". The external defences of the palace were handled by the Presidential Guard, which consisted of 2,500 troops and three T-54 tanks. Several Soviet commanders involved in the assassination of Amin thought the plan to attack the palace was \"crazy\". Although the military had been informed by the Soviet leadership through their commanders, Yuri Drozdov and Vasily Kolesnik, that the leader was a \"CIA agent\" who had betrayed the Saur Revolution, many Soviet soldiers hesitated; despite what their commanders had told them, it seemed implausible that Amin, the leader of the PDPA government, was an American double agent. Despite several objections, the plan to assassinate Amin went ahead.", "The assault on the palace began shortly afterward. During the attack Amin still believed the Soviet Union was on his side, and told his adjutant, \"The Soviets will help us\". The adjutant replied that it was the Soviets who were attacking them; Amin initially replied that this was a lie. Only after he tried but failed to contact the Chief of the General Staff, he muttered, \"I guessed it. It's all true\". There are various accounts of how Amin died, but the exact details have never been confirmed. Amin was either killed by a deliberate attack or died by a \"random burst of fire\". Amin's son was fatally wounded and died shortly after. His daughter was wounded, but survived. It was Gulabzoy who had been given orders to kill Amin and Watanjar who later confirmed his death. The men of Amin's family were all executed either immediately or shortly thereafter (his brother Abdullah and nephew Asadullah were executed in June 1980) The women including his daughter were imprisoned at Pul-e-Charkhi prison until being released by President Najibullah in early 1992.Afgantsy: The Russians in Afghanistan 1979\u201389 by Rodric Braithwaite After Amin's death on 27 December 1979, Radio Kabul broadcast Babrak Karmal's pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people, saying: \"Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed\". Karmal was installed by the Soviets as the new leader while the Soviet Army began its intervention in Afghanistan that would last for nine years."]}, {"page": "May 17", "response": ["*1932 \u2013 Rodric Braithwaite, English soldier and diplomat, British Ambassador to Russia"]}, {"page": "Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Sir Rodric Braithwaite, 1992\u201393"]}, {"page": "Order of St Michael and St George", "response": ["| 8 ||  Sir Rodric Braithwaite ||  || British diplomat || 1994"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Steele", "response": ["The Economist described Ghosts of Afghanistan: The Haunted Battleground (2011) as being a \"fine modern history\" with Steele's multiple visits to the country over many years meaning he \"is well placed to compare the end of the Soviet era and the present 'transition', the favoured common euphemism for foreign withdrawal.\" Rodric Braithwaite, in The Observer, comments that Steele \"writes with increasing despair about the failing efforts of the United States and its allies to build a viable Afghan state out of the physical, institutional and human rubble left behind by three decades of civil war and foreign intervention.\""]}, {"page": "Ivan Panfilov", "response": ["The 316th Division's new line of defense, near the village of Dubosekovo, was overrun by the Germans on 15\u201316 November; Soviet newspapers later claimed that on the 16th, twenty-eight soldiers from the division's 1075th Regiment destroyed eighteen German tanks while fighting to the last man, though an investigation by a Soviet military judge in 1948 revealed the tale was exaggerated.Chris Bellamy.

After nearly completing the Russian conquest of Central Asia (Russian Turkestan) the Russians captured an Afghan border fort. Seeing a threat to India, Britain came close to threatening war but both sides backed down and the matter was settled by diplomacy. The effect was to stop further Russian expansion in Asia, except for the Pamir Mountains and to define the north-western border of Afghanistan. However Russia's foreign minister Nikolay Girs and its ambassador to London Baron de Staal in 1887 set up a buffer zone in Central Asia. Russian diplomacy thereby won grudging British acceptance of its expansionism.Raymond Mohl, \"Confrontation in Central Asia\" History Today 19 (1969) 176-183 Persia was also an arena of tension, but without warfare.Firuz Kazemzadeh, Russia and Britain in Persia, 1864-1914: A Study in Imperialism (Yale UP, 1968)."]}, {"page": "Duke of Westminster's Medal for Military Literature", "response": ["* 2011: Sir Rodric Braithwaite: Afgantsy: The Russians in Afghanistan, 1979\u201389"]}, {"page": "Grigory Oriol", "response": ["At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War he headed the Armoured Automobiles department in the General Staff, and later became the commander of the armored and mechanized divisions in the 16th Army, under General Rokossovsky.A brief history  of the 16th Army mechanized formations.
