He was the fifth of seven cricket playing brothers who resided at Arnos Grove. They played a major part in establishing the Middlesex County Cricket Club, which was founded in 1864. Their cricket ground in Southgate is maintained by the Walker Trust to this day.\nWalker was a right-handed batsman and an underarm slow right arm bowler who represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1856\u20131870), a Middlesex XI (1859\u20131863) and Middlesex County Cricket Club (1864\u20131877).\nIn 1859 for an All-England Eleven  against Surrey County Cricket Club at The Oval he scored 20 not out, then took all 10 of the Surrey wickets (for 74 runs). In the second innings he scored 108 not out and took another 4 wickets. This was in a season where only 2 other centuries were scored in first-class matches.

At the end of the tour, an additional fixture was arranged by V. E. Walker, who went on to become president of both the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and Middlesex County Cricket Club. The match, which was described in The South Australian Advertiser as being \"novel and interesting\", combined Australian and English players into two teams; those who smoked and those who did not. The match was played to raise money for the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society, in which it was considered very successful, raising in excess of \u00a3561. Walker also wanted the British public to have an opportunity to see members of the Australian touring party play against each other, to which end Alick Bannerman, George Bonnor, Billy Murdoch and Tup Scott represented the Non-Smokers, while George Giffen, Percy McDonnell, Eugene Palmer and Frederick Spofforth played for the Smokers. The reporter from The South Australian Advertiser judged that the Smokers had the stronger batsmen, while the Non-Smokers had the better bowlers."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*V.

The 19th century cricket writer Arthur Haygarth, writing in the fourth volume of his Scores and Biographies and quoted in Drake's obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1905, described Drake thus: \"Is a very fine, energetic, and most active field anywhere, generally, however, taking long-leg and middle-wicket. Bowls slow under-hand 'lobs', twisting in from the leg to the off. At times they are very telling, but the analysis shows that they receive a good deal of punishment. As a batsman (using a bat of great weight) he is one of the most slashing that has yet appeared, hitting at almost everything, and generally sending the ball all over the ground.\" Wisden itself concluded that \"his fame as a cricketer was chiefly due to his skill as a lob bowler, he being ranked as second only to V. E. Walker \u2013 longo intervallo, however. Still a careful perusal of scores leads one to believe that he was of more assistance to a side as a batsman than as a bowler.\""]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1827\u20131863)", "response": ["* V.
