Here, she is portrayed as a dark-haired, deranged and evil middle-aged sorceress. She is a coward at heart who grovels before the Nome King and begs for her life when he is displeased with her. She makes a deal with the Nome King for if she trapped Princess Ozma in her enchanted mirror, he would make her a princess and gives her thirty beautiful heads (two of them are portrayed by Sophie Ward and Fiona Victory) which she could switch depending on her mood. He also gives her the Emerald City after he took away the emeralds. Mombi also guards the Powder of Life. When Dorothy encounters \"Princess Mombi\" in her palace, Mombi develops a fondness for Dorothy's head and locks her in the tower, planning to remove her head and take it once the girl has reached adulthood. Dorothy however escapes and steals the Powder of Life from a case which also contains Mombi's true head. Unfortunately, she awakens the head, which screams Dorothy's name, thereby awakening the other heads in turn, which all begin screaming her name. Ultimately, all the screaming awakens Mombi's headless body, which relentlessly pursues Dorothy, although the girl manages to escape. Donning her true head, Mombi sends her sinister minions the Wheelers after Dorothy. At the climax of the film, the Nome King imprisons Mombi in a magical cage for failing him. Like in Baum's original book, Mombi is stripped of all her magical powers at the end of the story (except by Dorothy, rather than Glinda, in this film). Though Princess Ozma forgives an imprisoned Mombi, on Earth, her counterpart is Nurse Wilson, the head nurse at the mental clinic that is run by Dr. J.B. Worley. The two of them have been using the machines at the clinic to secretly give their patients brain damage. When a power outage occurred during a thunderstorm, Nurse Wilson chased after Dorothy and loses her. After Dorothy returned to Kansas, she sees that Nurse Wilson was arrested and locked up in a cage on a horse buggy while Dr. Worley was mentioned to have perished in the fire caused by the thunderstorm."]}, {"page": "Citizens Theatre", "response": ["Amongst those who have trod the boards at the Citizens Theatre or worked backstage are Pierce Brosnan, Steven Berkoff, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Rupert Everett, Helen Baxendale, Tim Roth, Celia Imrie, Mark Rylance, Laurance Rudic, Lorcan Cranitch, Tim Curry, Laura Briggs Sean Bean, Una McLean, Ann Mitchell, Alan Rickman, Andrew Bunton, Glenda Jackson, David Yelland Greg Hicks, David Hayman, Iain Robertson, Petriece O'Donnell, Henry Ian Cusick, Robbie Coltrane, Stanley Baxter, Molly Urquhart, Allison McKenzie, Duncan Macrae, Fulton Mackay, Emily Murphy, Jonathan Watson, Gary Oldman, Olivia Hughes, Leonard Maguire, Fidelis Morgan, Colette 'Saboteur' Marshall, Moira Shearer, Julie Le Grand, Andrew Keir, Sophie Ward, Roberta Taylor, Lewis Collins, Sam Heughan, Karen Fishwick and Trisha Biggar (who designed the costumes for Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith), was for very many years, wardrobe mistress.
