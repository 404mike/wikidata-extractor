In 1894 he beat Harry S. Barlow before losing to Ernest Lewis. In 1895 he beat Reginald Doherty before handing a walkover to his brother. In 1896 he beat William Larned before losing to Wilberforce Eaves. In 1891 and 1894\u20131896 he and his twin brother Wilfred won the Wimbledon doubles championship four times. When Wilfred was beaten in the 1896 singles Challenge Round by Harold Mahony, they both retired from lawn tennis to concentrate on their law career.\nIn February 1895 the brothers qualified in London as solicitors. They joined their uncle and father Thomas and E. P. Baddeley in Leadenhall Street at the family firm, founded by their great grandfather in 1790. The brothers remained partners in the firm until 1919, when they retired leaving their cousin, Cyril Baddeley, to carry on in the family name. His daughter Violet Baddeley twice reached the final of the All England Open Badminton Championships in 1922 and 1927.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Three-peat", "response": ["*1894-1896  Wilfred Baddeley and  Herbert Baddeley"]}, {"page": "Lottie Dod", "response": ["Apart from entering women's tournaments, Dod sometimes also played and won matches against men (who usually played with a handicap), and on one occasion defeated star players Ernest Renshaw and George Hillyard (the husband of Blanche) when doubling with Herbert Baddeley."]}, {"page": "Reginald Doherty", "response": ["| style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1896 || Wimbledon || Grass ||  Harold Nisbet ||  Herbert Baddeley Wilfred Baddeley || 6\u20131, 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 2\u20136, 1\u20136 ||", "| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1897 || Wimbledon || Grass ||  Laurence Doherty ||  Herbert Baddeley Wilfred Baddeley || 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 8\u20136, 6\u20134 ||"]}, {"page": "List of Grand Slam men's doubles champions", "response": ["| 1891 || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created ||  Herbert Baddeley (1/4) Wilfred Baddeley (1/4)||  Oliver Campbell (2/3)  Robert Huntington (1/2)", "| 1894 || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created ||  Herbert Baddeley (2/4)  Wilfred Baddeley (2/4)||  Clarence Hobart (3/3) Fred Hovey (2/2)", "| 1895 || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created ||  Herbert Baddeley (3/4)  Wilfred Baddeley (3/4)||  Malcolm Chace Robert Wrenn", "| 1896 || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created || style=\"background: #ececec; color: grey; text-align: center\" class=\"table-na\" | tournament not created ||  Herbert Baddeley (4/4)  Wilfred Baddeley (4/4)||  Carr Neel Samuel Neel"]}]}}
