His only first-class outing brought him little personal glory.  He scored a 2 not out at number 11 in Yorkshire's first innings, and then a duck when he was promoted to open second time around.  Although he bowled ten overs for just 14 runs in Kent's second innings, he did not take a wicket, and Kent won just seven runs as Yorkshire were bowled out for 114 chasing 121 to win.\nHe died aged 50, in Sheffield in February 1897.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crookes (surname)", "response": ["*Ralph Crookes (1846\u20131897), English cricketer "]}]}}
