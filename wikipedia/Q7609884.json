Kirk and Watson began exploring the intersection of technology and music, producing tapes loops to generate sound collages and unusual sound structures. Kirk began to add traditional instrumentation, including clarinet and guitar. In late 1973, they brought on Kirk's friend Stephen Mallinder to provide vocals and bass guitar. Some of these early experiments were first documented on the Industrial Records cassette 1974-1976 (1980), then later on the triple album CD set Methodology '74/'78: The Attic Tapes (Mute 2002).", "* Stephen Mallinder \u2013 vocals, bass, keyboards (1973\u20131994)"]}, {"page": "Shaun Ryder", "response": ["In 2000, following the Big Day Out Festival in Australia with Happy Mondays, Ryder stayed on in Perth, Western Australia with Pete Carroll, who had a record label called Offworld Sounds.

And you don\u2019t need to be a vocal acrobat to get an emotion across\". He started off his career as a \"non-singer\", with his vocals often heavily treated with effects. His guttural and oftentimes unintelligible delivery became a hallmark of Skinny Puppy's music. His lyrics, usually delivered as a stream of consciousness meant to invoke certain images to the listener, range from surrealistic to overtly sociopolitical, and explore topics such as vivisection, war, disease, the environment, addiction, and self-determination. The meaning behind his lyrics is often obscured by the cacophony of music surrounding them. \"We're more into creating moods, and within them there's a lot more freedom for people to make up their minds and apply the lyrics to themselves and different situations\". When asked if he was bothered by people misinterpreting his lyrics, he replied \"art is for interpretation, and interpretation can take on whatever form it wants\"."]}]}}
