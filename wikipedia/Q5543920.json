Liddell put the ball in the net, but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already over. In the quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing Everton at Maine Road. Trailing 1\u20130 at half-time after a Jimmy Harris goal, City overcame the deficit in the second half with goals from Hayes and Johnstone. Further controversy followed in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1\u20130 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a penalty after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward George Robb's leg. No further goalscoring opportunities occurred, and City hung on for the victory.Maddox, Saffer & Robinson, Manchester City Cup Kings 1956, pp.\u00a045\u201346."]}, {"page": "2011 in association football", "response": ["* 25 December \u2013 George Robb, English footballer (85)"]}, {"page": "Detente (band)", "response": ["*George Robb (Agent Steel)"]}, {"page": "Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team squads", "response": ["| FW ||align=\"left\"| George Robb || June 1, 1926 || 26 || ? ||align=\"left\"|  Finchley F.C. || 1 || 1 || 120 || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013"]}, {"page": "List of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. seasons", "response": ["|George RobbSonny Walters"]}, {"page": "1958 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["|OL||11|| George Robb"]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**George Robb, footballer (b. 1926)"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 in English football", "response": ["*25 December 2011: George Robb, 85, former Tottenham Hotspur outside left and British Olympian."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2011", "response": ["*George Robb, 85, English footballer (Tottenham Hotspur F.C.), dementia."]}, {"page": "Robb, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Robb"]}]}}
