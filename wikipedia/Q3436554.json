Filmed in Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, the ad's focus was on an office clerk - played by Robert Wilfort - who utilizes his Barclaycard while traveling home on a waterslide, a metaphor for the ease with which the card may be used. The ad was first aired 25 October 2008, and two weeks later \"Let Your Love Flow\" re-entered the UK Top 100 singles chart dated 8 November 2008 at #48, with the track eventually peaking at #21 over a six-week tenure with subsequent UK chart tenures of five weeks in February/ March 2009 (peak #48) and three weeks that summer (#76). Speaking for the Bellamy Brothers, David Bellamy would state: \"We had no idea the song 'Let Your Love Flow' had been licensed to Barclay for an advertisement [until] after the single started climbing the charts in England. Any artist is always thrilled when one of your signature songs has longevity like this because it was thirty-two years ago when we first released the tune. We\u2019ve always had such faithful fans in Europe, like we do in the United States, but with the single charting again we\u2019re introducing our music to a whole new generation of music lovers.\"  "]}, {"page": "The Commander (TV series)", "response": ["* Robert Wilfort as D.I.
