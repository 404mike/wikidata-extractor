Some of Wheeler's original goals remain important for this work, particularly the hope of laying a solid foundation for quantum gravity.

Fowler derided those who prescribed against the inanimate whose, writing: \"in the starch that stiffens English style one of the most effective ingredients is the rule that whose shall refer only to persons\"; he asserted that the alternative adds flexibility to style and proclaimed: \"Let us, in the name of common sense, prohibit the prohibition of inanimate whose\".  The revised versions of that style guide by Robert Burchfield (1996) and Jeremy Butterfield (2015) called the avoidance of the inanimate whose a \"folk-belief\".  In his Plain Words of 1954, Ernest Gowers calls the \"grammarians' rule\" that whose \"must not be used of inanimate objects\u00a0... a cramping one, productive of ugly sentences and a temptation to misplaced commas\".  He states that \"sensible writers have always ignored the rule, and sensible grammarians have now abandoned it\"."]}, {"page": "International Academy of Philosophy of Science", "response": ["*Jeremy Butterfield"]}]}}
