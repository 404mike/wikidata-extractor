However, he decided to sign for his former teammate at Colchester Richard Wilkins, who was managing Isthmian League side Bury Town at the time. Brown signed on 18 October 2011, turning down offers from Football League sides in order to not uproot his young family and reluctance to be a squad player. He also said that he was becoming more involved in his family business, and that his wife was expecting a baby in December. The terms with Bury allowed Brown to leave in January 2012 if a Football League club came in for him that would be financially and geographically suitable for Brown."]}, {"page": "History of Hereford United F.C.", "response": ["The season that followed, 1996\u201397, saw a complete reverse in the club's fortunes. With debts mounting and the club having made a loss of over \u00a3300,000, Turner was forced to sell key players such as White and Richard Wilkins. A terrible run of form when the club went three months without a win meant they were sucked into the relegation dogfight. Brighton & Hove Albion, with their own well documented troubles, had seemed destined for relegation for much of the season. But they climbed above Hereford on the penultimate day of the season, leaving the Bulls 24th and bottom of the entire Football League.  Both teams were level on points, and Hereford had a better goal difference, but the goals scored rule was in effect and Brighton had scored more goals. On 3 May 1997 the two clubs met in a relegation decider at Edgar Street, which was the subject of considerable media interest as one club would relegate the other. Hereford needed a win to survive while Brighton only required a draw thanks to their having scored more goals. A capacity crowd saw Hereford take the lead in the first half through an own goal by Kerry Mayo from Tony Agana's cross. Brighton equalised in the second half against the run of play through Robbie Reinelt, who snapped up the rebound after a shot crashed against the post. In the last minute Hereford had a chance to save themselves but leading scorer Adrian Foster shot weakly at the goalkeeper when one-on-one. The final whistle blew and Hereford were relegated after 25 years in the Football League. Graham Turner subsequently resigned as manager but withdrew his resignation after strong support from the board and supporters. The general belief around the club at the time was that the club were merely 'on loan' to the Conference, but it would prove to be a long road back."]}, {"page": "Richard Wilkins", "response": ["Richard Wilkins or Rick Wilkins may refer to:", "*Richard Wilkins (TV presenter) (born 1954), Australian TV presenter", "*Richard Wilkins (law) (1952\u20132012), assistant solicitor general in the US during the 1980s and advocate of international recognition of the family", "*Richard Wilkins (footballer) (born 1965), English footballer and manager", "*Richard Wilkins (chef) (born 1989), English fine dining chef ", "*Richard Wilkins (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), fictional mayor of Sunnydale in the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer"]}, {"page": "Wilkins (surname)", "response": ["** Richard Wilkins (footballer), English footballer", "** Richard Wilkins (law), American law professor", "** Richard Wilkins (TV presenter), Australian television presenter", "* Richard Wilkins, fictional character in Buffy the Vampire Slayer"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["Steve Whitton was appointed Wadsworth's replacement after serving as caretaker manager and having been Wadsworth's assistant.
