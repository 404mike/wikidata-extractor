Ratcliffe did not defend the seat at the next election, in 1935, when Bromfield was returned in a two-person contest with a National Labour Party candidate.  It was suggested that he should stand in the 1939 General Election, but that did not happen.He owned a building firm and built a house for himself on a hill at Ecton in Staffordshire, about 12 miles from the town of Leek. It became known as \"Ratcliffe's Folly\", or \"The Castle\"  because of its copper spire and battlements.  Construction started in 1922 and continued until 1939 with various alterations and additions. The spire was constructed in 1937 and completed with an 8-inch golden ball on the top.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ratcliffe", "response": ["* Arthur Ratcliffe (1882\u20131963), British Conservative Member of Parliament for Leek 1931\u20131935"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Arthur Ratcliffe"]}, {"page": "Ecton, Staffordshire", "response": ["Arthur Ratcliffe MP built a house, modelled on a mediaeval castle, complete with battlements, next to the former lead mine in 1932."]}, {"page": "Butterton", "response": ["On Ecton hillside is the unusual copper-topped house known as The Hillocks which was built in 1933 by Arthur Ratcliffe, the MP for Leek.
