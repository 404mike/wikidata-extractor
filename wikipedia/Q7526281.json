John Rugge was buried at Temple Church on Monday 28 November 1720. Elizabeth writes in her will that if she if dies in or near London that she wanted to be 'buried in the Temple Church Yard in or near my dear husbands Grave'. She got her wish and was buried beside him on Wednesday 31 October 1753. Elizabeth is mentioned in no less than three family wills as being assigned important tasks of the type usually given to dependable and trustworthy people. She is left the cedar chest in her lodgings with the glass doors, the pendulum clock and ten pounds in ready money, by her cousin and brother-in-law John Ball (d.1732), in consideration for her care and trouble in receiving and paying his rents. In her will she gives to 'my faithful Servant Ann Rainsford' thirty pounds and what is needed to furnish a room for her to live in.
