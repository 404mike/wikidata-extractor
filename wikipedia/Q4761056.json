The only goal came in the 35th minute, when Reuben Hazell headed in a goal after a cross from Neal Eardley. The game was played at a quick pace for most of the day as a total of 10 yellow cards were shown, but Oldham held out for a 1\u20130 win. On 13 September, Oldham was back at home to face 2007\u201308 League Two champions, Milton Keynes Dons. Lee Hughes didn't wait long to get the scoring started as he gave Oldham a 1\u20130 lead by scoring in the 8th minute. Despite seven shots on target, MK Dons could not get a goal past goalkeeper Mark Crossley before Mark Allott grabbed Oldham's second and final goal in the 95th minute. Oldham battled Hartlepool United on 20 September for their seventh league game of the season. Lee Hughes and Chris Taylor gave Oldham a solid 2\u20130 lead heading into the halftime break. Hartlepool battled back hard in the opening moments of the second half, scoring three times in first ten minutes of the second half with goals from Andy Monkhouse, Antony Sweeney, and Joel Porter. In the 58th minute, Taylor scored Oldham's third of the game as the two teams finished the game with a 3\u20133 draw. Again at home, Oldham faced off against 15th placed local rivals Huddersfield. Ian Craney scored his second in five games, giving the visitors an early 1\u20130 lead in the 29th minute. An Andy Liddell free kick early in the second half would be enough, as the game ended with a 1\u20131 draw."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["|Andy Monkhouse "]}]}}
