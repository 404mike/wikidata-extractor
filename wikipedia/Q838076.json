The character is depicted as the founder and sometimes leader of the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #1 (September 1963).\nXavier is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. He is an exceptionally powerful telepath, who can read and control the minds of others. To both shelter and train mutants from around the world, he runs a private school in the X-Mansion in Salem Center, located in Westchester County, New York. Xavier also strives to serve a greater good by promoting peaceful coexistence and equality between humans and mutants in a world where zealous anti-mutant bigotry is widespread.\nThroughout much of the character's history in comics, Xavier is a paraplegic using a standard or modified wheelchair. One of the world's most powerful mutant telepaths, Xavier is a scientific genius and a leading authority in genetics. He has devised Cerebro and other equipment to enhance psionic powers and detect and track people with the mutant gene.\nFrom a social policy and philosophical perspective, Xavier deeply resents the violent methods of those like his former close friend and occasional enemy, the supervillain Magneto. Instead, he has presented his platform of uncompromising pacifism to see his dream to fruition \u2013 one that seeks to live harmoniously alongside humanity with full civil rights and equality for mutants. Xavier's actions and goals have been compared to those of Martin Luther King Jr. and the American civil rights struggle, whereas Magneto is often compared with the more militant civil rights activist Malcolm X.The character's creation and development occurred during the civil rights struggle of the early 1960s; Xavier's first appearance was in 1963. The fictionalized plight of mutantkind faced with intolerance and prejudice was meant to illuminate to audiences of the day what was transpiring across the United States and to promote ideals of tolerance and equality for all.Patrick Stewart portrayed the character in the first three films in the X-Men film series and in various video games, while James McAvoy portrayed a younger version of the character in the 2011 prequel X-Men: First Class. Both actors reprised the role in the film X-Men: Days of Future Past. McAvoy reprised the role in X-Men: Apocalypse, and Stewart in Logan.

Cable gives Paul the Phoenix Cage device created by the Avengers back in 2012 to recreate the device so he could resurrect Cyclops. Cable and Paul manage to find Cyclops's corpse after his public 'death', and implanted a smaller version of the Phoenix Cage into the corpse's heart. When Cyclops was temporarily brought back by the Phoenix during Jean's resurrection, the Phoenix Cage is activated and absorbs a small portion of Phoenix Force which eventually restored Cyclops to full life even after the Phoenix abandoned him. After the time-displaced X-Men manage to return to their time, Cyclops gains the extra memories of his past-self, while finding out that the original older Cable had been screwing the timeline for keeping the younger X-Men in the present. Although Cable admits that he brought his father back to life primarily because he saw his death as unfair, he keeps Cyclops contained in his base until the other X-Men are engaged in battle against Nate Grey at the same moment as Professor Marvin escapes prison and goes after Paul for revenge, Cable then forcing Cyclops to choose which of the two he will save. Although the other X-Men are apparently killed by Nate, Cyclops' decision to save Paul allows him to reassess his actions prior to his death and conclude that he had become as bad as his enemies, choosing to help mutants over humans regardless of the consequences. Visiting Utopia, the place where he killed Professor X during the Avengers vs. X-Men event and also where Nate vanishes the participating X-Men, Cyclops vows to find the lost X-Men and restore them to create a brighter future, joined by the resurrected Wolverine, but unable to save Blindfold from committing her own suicide attempts.The Uncanny X-Men vol. 5 Annual #1 (January 2019).

To prevent the destruction of any objects in his field of view, Cyclops uses a pair of ruby quartz eyeglasses developed by Professor X to contain the devastating rays. In his X-Men uniform, he uses a ruby quartz battle visor in place of the glasses. The crystal is said to resonate at the same frequency as the psionic field that protects Cyclops (and Havok) from their own powers. His uniform has firing studs incorporated into his gloves and on the sides of the battle visor that control the visor's aperture.

In the process, Luficer also traps Xavier in the Nameless Dimension with him, the Nameless Dimension being depicted as a featureless realm filled with a thick liquid-like substance that Lucifer and Xavier can 'breathe' as though they are still inhaling oxygen. Although Lucifer is able to create beings made of pure ionic energy, his ability to create such beings is apparently limited, and they are of limited capabilities; two such beings were able to defeat Xavier and Iceman and abduct Xavier only because they had the element of surprise and raw power as well as being immune to telepathy. Due to the limitations of these constructs and his own twisted sense of irony, Lucifer has the duplicate Xavier use the original X-Men as his agents, sending them to acquire three components from Quistalian outposts around the globe. The duplicate Xavier intends to use these components to alter the machine that had sent the Professor into the Nameless Dimension so that it could be used to allow Lucifer to return to Earth, the duplicate claiming to the X-Men that he could use those components to devise a machine to protect Earth from future Quistalian invasion. Xavier attempts to warn his students, but although he can telepathically penetrate the dimensional barrier to witness events back on Earth, his abilities are subsequently too weak to access the complex minds of either Beast or Jean Grey. Fortunately, Xavier was able to make contact with Jeffery Saunders, the mentally handicapped grandson of a recently deceased friend, whose limited mental state made him more 'open' to Xavier's influence. Using Jeffrey's physically superior body - the young boy being an exceptional athlete despite his mental state - the Professor was able to alert the X-Men to the deception when the duplicate Xavier just tried to have Jeffrey sent home when he first came to the mansion; Iceman had witnessed the real Xavier interacting with Jeremy at his grandfather's funeral, and was struck by how the duplicate was acting far more distant towards Jeffrey. With the duplicate Xavier captured, Xavier-in-Jeffrey accompanied the X-Men when they departed to retrieve the final component, and was later able to defeat an ionic duplicate of Archangel - created after the original was injured and captured while they were investigating one of the facilities - that could have allowed Lucifer to use the newly modified portal to return to their dimension. Although Xavier was briefly tempted to destroy the machine when he thought that Lucifer might be able to reach the exit portal before him, Jeffrey was able to help him escape by 'sending' the Professor his own youthful energy back along their psychic link, giving Xavier the strength to beat Lucifer to the portal in a swimming race, the portal being deactivated just as Lucifer's hand attempted to emerge after Xavier.
