He said his songs feature expressive melodies, relaxed tempos, and definite song structures, which are sometimes \"either counterpointed or strung together in a suite\". Ken Hyder from Hi-Fi News & Record Review appreciated how Sharrock had abandoned the rhythmic strumming style of his past work in favor of \"a post-Hendrix feedback electric guitar sound\" in an elaborate overdubbing process that sustained his well\u2013defined guitar lines. Hyder recommended the album to listeners of all genres and said Sharrock's playing recalled blues, R&B, and folk melodies. \"Throughout all the distortion he avoids the one-dimensional emotion trap and comes up with something intensely warm and human.\" At the end of 1986, Christgau named it the year's eighth best record in his list for the Pazz & Jop critics poll, and later wrote that both Guitar and Sharrock's next album\u2014Seize the Rainbow (1987)\u2014could restore any listener's interest in jazz fusion."]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1946 in jazz, deaths of Fred Beckett, James Tim Brymn, Joseph Petit, Manuel Perez, Putney Dandridge, and Tricky Sam Nanton; births of Al Green, Al Lowe, Allan Holdsworth, Andr\u00e9 Ceccarelli, Atilla Engin, B.
