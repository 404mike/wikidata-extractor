Wodehouse", "response": ["Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse,  ( ; 15 October 188114 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. His creations include the feather-brained Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet, Jeeves; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set; the Oldest Member, with stories about golf; and Mr Mulliner, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.", "===Psmith, Blandings, Wooster and Jeeves: 1908\u20131915===", "Wodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; Psmith, Journalist, mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915.McCrum, p. 91 In the same year The Saturday Evening Post paid $3,500 to serialise Something New, the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle.Wodehouse and Ratcliffe, p. 94 It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled Something Fresh).McCrum, p. 504 It was Wodehouse's first farcical novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known.Usborne, p. 17 Later in the same year \"Extricating Young Gussie\", the first story about Bertie and Jeeves, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid Lord Emsworth to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother Galahad, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings.Usborne, pp. 117\u2013118 The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.Usborne, pp. 173\u2013175", "In the years after the war, Wodehouse steadily increased his sales, polished his existing characters and introduced new ones.  Bertie and Jeeves, Lord Emsworth and his circle, and Ukridge appeared in novels and short stories; Psmith made his fourth and last appearance; two new characters were the Oldest Member, narrating his series of golfing stories,Usborne, p. 166 and Mr Mulliner, telling his particularly tall tales to fellow patrons of the bar at the Angler's Rest.Usborne, p. 167 Various other young men-about-town appeared in short stories about members of the Drones Club.", "In 1935 Wodehouse created the last of his regular cast of principal characters, Lord Ickenham, otherwise known as Uncle Fred, who, in Usborne's words, \"leads the dance in four novels and a short story... a whirring dynamo of misrule\".Usborne, p. 127 His other books from the decade include Right Ho, Jeeves, which Donaldson judged his best work, Uncle Fred in the Springtime, which the writer Bernard Levin considered the best, and Blandings Castle, which contains \"Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend\", which Rudyard Kipling thought \"one of the most perfect short stories I have ever read\".", "When Wodehouse heard of the furore the broadcasts had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office\u2014through the Swiss embassy in Berlin\u2014to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave.Connolly, p. 93Phelps, p. 216 In Performing Flea, a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, \"Of course I ought to have had the sense to see that it was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect\".Wodehouse, Performing Flea, Letter of 11 May 1942, p. 115 The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication PM accused Wodehouse of \"play[ing] Jeeves to the Nazis\", but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.", "Most of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s.Marsh, Pamela (21 December 1967). \"The World of Wodehouse\", The Christian Science Monitor 60 (23): 11, quoted in Pavlovski and Darga, p. 334 The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\".Lejeune, Anthony (11 December 1995). \"Jeeves's England\", National Review: 132, quoted in Pavlovski and Darga, p. 333 Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\".Wodehouse and Donaldson, p. 144 The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".McCrum, pp. 407 and 501", "In 1941 the Concise Cambridge History of English Literature opined that Wodehouse had \"a gift for highly original aptness of phrase that almost suggests a poet struggling for release among the wild extravagances of farce\",Sampson, pp. 977\u2013978 while McCrum thinks that Wodehouse manages to combine \"high farce with the inverted poetry of his mature comic style\", particularly in The Code of the Woosters; the novelist Anthony Powell believes Wodehouse to be a \"comic poet\".Voorhees (1966), p. 173 Robert A. Hall Jr., in his study of Wodehouse's style and technique, describes the author as a master of prose, an opinion also shared by Levin, who considers Wodehouse \"one of the finest and purest writers of English prose\".Levin, Bernard. \"As Jeeves would have said: Perfect music, Sir\", The Times, 18 February 1975, p. 14 Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character \"de-Beaned the cupboard\". Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides \"hobnobbing\" when he writes: \"To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing. Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing.\"", "Richard Voorhees, Wodehouse's biographer, believes that the author used clich\u00e9s in a deliberate and ironic manner.Voorhees (1966), p. 165 His opinion is shared by the academic Stephen Medcalf, who deems Wodehouse's skill is to \"bring a clich\u00e9 just enough to life to kill it\",Medcalf, Stephen (1976). \"The Innocence of P.G. Wodehouse\" in The Modern English Novel: The Reader, the Writer and the Work, quoted in Pavlovski and Darga, p. 338 although Pamela March, writing in The Christian Science Monitor, considers Wodehouse to have \"an ability to declich\u00e9 a clich\u00e9\".Marsh, Pamela (21 December 1967). \"The World of Wodehouse\", The Christian Science Monitor 60 (23): 11, quoted in Pavlovski and Darga, p. 335 Medcalf provides an example from Right Ho, Jeeves in which the teetotal Gussie Fink-Nottle has surreptitiously been given whisky and gin in a punch prior to a prize-giving:", "\u2009'It seems to me, Jeeves, that the ceremony may be one fraught with considerable interest.'", "The stylistic device most commonly found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate \"resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous\". Examples can be seen in Joy in the Morning, Chapter 29: \"There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action\", or Psmith, Chapter 7: \"A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation.\" Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in a story or novel, according to Hall.Hall, Robert A. Jr. \"The Transferred Epithet in P.G. Wodehouse\", Linguistic Inquiry, Winter 1973, pp. 92\u201394 ", "\u2014Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, Chapter 1", "\"The first thing he did was to prod Jeeves in the lower ribs with an uncouth forefinger.\"", "\u2014Much Obliged, Jeeves, Chapter 4", "Wordplay is a key element in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, when Bertie is released after a night in the police cells, and says that he has \"a pinched look\" about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in Uncle Dynamite when Constable Potter says he has been \"assaulted by the duck pond\". In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word \"by\", asks: \"How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?\" Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who \"not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail\", or Wooster's complaint that \"the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup.\"Voorhees (1966), pp. 166\u2013167 Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit Bertie asks Jeeves \"Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and\u00a0... what's the word? Something about cats.\" Jeeves replies, \"Cataclysms, sir?\""]}, {"page": "Stephen Fry", "response": ["Stephen John Fry (born 24 August 1957) is an English actor, broadcaster, comedian, director and writer.

Jeeves often has another motive, such as disposing of an item recently acquired by Bertie that Jeeves does not like, for example a bright scarlet cummerbund. He sometimes receives a monetary reward from Bertie and other people he helps in early stories, though this does not occur in later stories.", "Bertie and Jeeves experience a variety of adventures in numerous short stories and novels. Aside from changes in his employment status, some events occur that are particularly noteworthy for Jeeves. Jeeves gets engaged twice in \"Jeeves in the Springtime\", though he never references these fianc\u00e9es afterward, and it appears that he does not become engaged again.Usborne (2003), p. 91. In the only story Jeeves narrates, \"Bertie Changes His Mind\", he opposes Bertie's decision to live with his nieces. Jeeves and Bertie visit Deverill Hall, where Jeeves's Uncle Charlie is employed as butler, in The Mating Season.", "In the novel Ring for Jeeves, which is set after World War II, Jeeves temporarily works as Lord Rowcester's butler while Bertie is sent to a school where the idle rich learn to fend for themselves. This is the only story in which Jeeves appears without Bertie Wooster. The novel was adapted from the play Come On, Jeeves.", "Jeeves's first name was not revealed until the penultimate novel, Much Obliged, Jeeves. Bertie Wooster learns Jeeves's name when he hears another valet greet Jeeves with \"Hullo, Reggie.\" The readers may have been surprised to learn Jeeves's first name, but Bertie was stunned by the revelation \"that he had a first name\" in the first place.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 38. \"'Hullo, Reggie,' he said, and I froze in my chair, stunned by the revelation that Jeeves's first name was Reginald. It had never occurred to me before that he had a first name\" (Bertie about Bingley greeting Jeeves).In the 1937 film Step Lively, Jeeves, Jeeves, portrayed by Arthur Treacher, states his first name to be Rupert.  However, Wodehouse had nothing to do with the script of that film, and Treacher's Jeeves character is so unlike Wodehouse's Jeeves that the viewer could easily believe him to be a different Jeeves altogether. In the club book of Jeeves's club, the Junior Ganymede, all members must record the foibles of their employers to forewarn other butlers and valets. Bertie wants Jeeves to destroy his section. Jeeves is initially reluctant to defy his club's rules, but he eventually does destroy the pages for Bertie by the end of Much Obliged, Jeeves.", "Jeeves last appears in Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, in which Jeeves and Bertie head to the rural village of Maiden Eggesford, though Jeeves wants to go to New York. He and Bertie visit New York at the end of the story.", "While Bertie Wooster is approximately 24 years old in \"Jeeves Takes Charge\" (1916), Jeeves's age is not stated in the stories, and has been interpreted differently by various illustrators and adaptations. However, there are a few hints in the books regarding Jeeves's age. Jeeves has a long employment history, and he is older than Bertie Wooster.Wodehouse (1968) [1966], Plum Pie, chapter 1, p. 46. Aunt Dahlia implies that Jeeves is \"maturer\" than Bertie. On the other hand, Jeeves is young enough to be engaged to a waitress courted by Bingo Little, who is the same age as Bertie Wooster, in \"Jeeves in the Springtime\". In Ring for Jeeves, Jeeves is described as resembling \"a youngish High Priest of a refined and dignified religion\".Wodeshouse (2008) [1953], Ring for Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 40.", "In the reference work Wodehouse in Woostershire by Wodehouse scholars Geoffrey Jaggard and Tony Ring, it is speculated using information provided in the Jeeves canon that Bertie's age ranges from approximately 24 to 29 over the stories, and that Jeeves is roughly ten years older than Bertie, giving an age range of 35 to 40.Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 124\u2013126. This happens to agree with a personal letter written in 1961 by P. G. Wodehouse to scholar Robert A. Hall, Jr., in which Wodehouse, explaining that his characters did not age with real life time, gave an approximate age for Jeeves:", "Keggs in A Damsel in Distress is supposed to be the same man who appears in The Butler Did It, but does it pan out all right? It doesn't if you go by when the books were written. The Damsel was published in 1919 and the Butler in 1957. But I always ignore real life time. After all, Jeeves\u2014first heard of at the age presumably of about thirty-five in 1916\u2014would now be around eighty-five, counting the real years.Hall (1974), pp. 16 and 19. Jeeves's first appearance was in \"Extricating Young Gussie\", which was published in 1915 the US. However, multiple Wodehouse reference books say that Jeeves first appeared in 1916, possibly because that is when he first appeared in both the US and the UK.", "In appearance, Jeeves is described as \"tall and dark and impressive\".Wodehouse (2008) [1953], Ring for Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 40. When they first meet in \"Jeeves Takes Charge\", Bertie describes Jeeves as \"a kind of darkish sort of respectful Johnnie\" with \"a grave, sympathetic face\" and a nearly silent way of walking that Bertie equates to a \"healing zephyr\".Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 12. On multiple occasions, Bertie states that Jeeves has \"finely chiselled features\", and a large head, which seems to Bertie to indicate intelligence.  As Bertie says, Jeeves is \"a godlike man in a bowler hat with grave, finely chiselled features and a head that stuck out at the back, indicating great brain power\".Wodehouse (2008) [1949], The Mating Season, chapter 23, p. 219. Bertie also describes Jeeves's eyes as gleaming with intelligence.", "Bertie frequently describes Jeeves as having a \"feudal spirit\". Jeeves enjoys helping Bertie and his friends,Usborne (2003), p. 86. and solves Bertie's personal problems despite not being obliged to do so. Jeeves interrupts his vacation twice to come to Bertie's aid (in \"The Love That Purifies\" and Jeeves in the Offing). He regularly rescues Bertie, usually from an unwanted marriage but also from other threats, such as when he saves Bertie from a hostile swan or when he pulls Bertie out of the way of a taxi.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 4, pp. 32\u201334. Jeeves is evidently offended when a revolutionary tells him that servants are outdated in \"Comrade Bingo\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 12, p. 126.", "Jeeves generally manipulates situations for the better and is described as \"a kindly man\" in Ring for Jeeves.Wodehouse (2008) [1953], Ring for Jeeves, chapter 19, p. 211. However, he does influence Bertie's decisions to suit his own preferences, such as when he causes Bertie to change his mind about living with his nieces in \"Bertie Changes His Mind\". Jeeves is also stubborn when opposing a new item that Bertie has taken a liking to, such as an alpine hat or purple socks. While he often stays on in spite of these radical objects, he can only withstand so much: the worst case is when he resigned after Bertie, privately labeling him as a \"domestic Mussolini\", resolved to study the banjolele in the countryside.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 1. Usually, Jeeves finds a way to help Bertie with a problem, and Bertie agrees to give away the item that Jeeves disapproves of. Even when Bertie and Jeeves are having a disagreement, Jeeves still shows sympathy, as much as he shows any emotion, when Bertie is in serious trouble.Wodehouse (2008) [1963], Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 33. Bertie says regarding Jeeves, \"He and the young master may have had differences about Alpine hats with pink feathers in them, but when he sees the y.m. on the receiving end of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, he sinks his dudgeon and comes through with the feudal spirit at its best. So now, instead of being cold and distant and aloof, as a lesser man would have been, he showed the utmost agitation and concern. That is to say, he allowed one eyebrow to rise perhaps an eighth of an inch, which is as far as he ever goes in the way of expressing emotion.\"", "Often wearing \"an expression of quiet intelligence combined with a feudal desire to oblige\",Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 50. Jeeves consistently maintains a calm and courteous demeanor. When he feels discomfort or is being discreet, he assumes an expressionless face which Bertie describes as resembling a \"stuffed moose\"Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 9, p. 94. or \"stuffed frog\".Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 12, p. 118 and chapter 21, p. 219. When very surprised, he will raise his eyebrow a small fraction of an inch, and when he is amused, the corner of his mouth twitches slightly.Wodehouse (2008) [1974], Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, chapter 5, p. 46, and chapter 20, p. 182. His composure extends to his voice, which is soft and respectful.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 31. When he wishes to start a conversation, he sometimes makes a low gentle cough \"like a very old sheep clearing its throat on a misty mountain top\".Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 11, p. 122. He may also cough to signify disapproval.Wodehouse (2008) [1963], Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, chapter 23, p. 191. Bertie states that he saw the normally imperturbable Jeeves come \"very near to being rattled\" for the first time when the sight of Bingo Little in a false beard caused Jeeves to drop his jaw and steady himself with a table in \"Comrade Bingo\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 12, p. 123\u201324. In Joy in the Morning, Bertie claims that the only occasion on which he had ever seen Jeeves \"really rattled\" was when he first met Bertie's friend Boko Fittleworth, who wears turtleneck sweaters and flannel trousers with a patch on the knee; Jeeves \"winced visibly and tottered off\" to recover his composure in the kitchen, where Bertie supposes Jeeves pulled himself together with cooking sherry.Wodehouse (2008) [1947], Joy in the Morning, chapter 6, p. 52.", "Bertie says that Jeeves is persuasive and magnetic.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 22, p. 269. Bertie describes Jeeves: \"He is magnetic. There is about him something that seems to soothe and hypnotize. To the best of my knowledge, he has never encountered a charging rhinoceros, but should this contingency occur, I have no doubt that the animal, meeting his eye, would check itself in mid-stride, roll over and lie purring with its legs in the air.\" He believes that Jeeves could convince a candidate standing for Parliament to vote against herself.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 8, p. 84. There is a poetic side to Jeeves, who recites a great deal of poetry. He is much affected when a parted couple reconciles, and tells Bertie that his heart leaps up when he beholds a rainbow in the sky.Wodehouse (2008) [1947], Joy in the Morning, chapter 16, p. 154 and chapter 17, p. 161. Jeeves is probably quoting William Wordsworth's poem \"My Heart Leaps Up\".", "It is not unusual for Bertie's acquaintances to ask for Jeeves's help directly without discussing it with Bertie, and Jeeves is willing to assist them even if Bertie is not involved in any way.Usborne (2003), p. 93. Bertie once says that Jeeves \"isn't so much a valet as a Mayfair consultant.\"Wodehouse (2008) [1949], The Mating Season, chapter 25, p. 245. On one occasion, Bertie considers it probable that even the distinguished Sir Roderick Glossop has consulted Jeeves, and says, \"Jeeves is like Sherlock Holmes. The highest in the land come to him with their problems. For all I know, they may give him jewelled snuff boxes.\"Wodehouse (1966), Plum Pie, chapter 1, p. 15.", "Jeeves presents the ideal image of the gentlemanly manservant, being highly competent, dignified, and respectful. He speaks intelligently and correctly, using proper titles for members of the nobility. One of his skills is moving silently and unobtrusively from room to room. According to Bertie, Jeeves noiselessly \"floats\" and \"shimmers\".Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 1, p. 1 and chapter 2, p. 28. Bertie once remarks, \"Presently I was aware that Jeeves was with me. I hadn't heard him come in, but you often don't with Jeeves. He just streams silently from spot A to spot B, like some gas\".Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 6, p. 136. In addition to being a proficient valet, Jeeves can serve capably as a butler, and does so on a few occasions. As Bertie says in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, \"If the call comes, he can buttle with the best of them.\"Cawthorne (2013), p. 170.", "Jeeves has an encyclopedic knowledge of literature and academic subjects. He frequently quotes from Shakespeare and the romantic poets. Well informed about members of the British aristocracy thanks to the club book of the Junior Ganymede Club, he also seems to have a considerable number of useful connections among various servants. Jeeves uses his knowledge and connections to solve problems inconspicuously.Cawthorne (2013), p. 173. Richard Usborne, a leading scholar of the life and works of Wodehouse, describes Jeeves as a \"godlike prime mover\" and \"master brain who is found to have engineered the apparent coincidence or coincidences\".Wodehouse at Work to the End, Richard Usborne 1976. To form his plans, Jeeves often studies \"the psychology of the individual\" or the personality of one or more people involved in the situation.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 98. Jeeves says that studying \"the psychology of the individual\" is essential to solving problems, and that this means studying \"the natures and dispositions of the principals in the matter\". His mental prowess is attributed to eating fish, according to Bertie Wooster, who credits the phosphorus content in the fish with boosting Jeeves's brain power. Jeeves does not try to argue this claim, though at least once he says he does not eat a lot of fish.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 137.", "One of Jeeves's greatest skills is making a special drink of his own invention, a strong beverage which momentarily stuns one's senses but is very effective in curing hangovers. The drink is Jeeves's version of a prairie oyster.Cawthorne (2013) p. 47. Bertie first hires Jeeves after his hangover is cured by one of Jeeves's special drinks. Not simply a hangover cure, the drink can also give energy to someone who needs it, yet calm down someone who is agitated.Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 7, p. 65. \"It's a curious thing about those specials of Jeeves's, and one on which many revellers have commented, that while, as I mentioned earlier, they wake the sleeping tiger in you, they also work the other way round. I mean, if the tiger in you isn't sleeping but on the contrary up and doing with a heart for any fate, they lull you in. You come in like a lion, you take your snootful, and you got out like a lamb. Impossible to explain it, of course. One can merely state the facts.\" Dark in colour, Jeeves's special pick-me-up is composed of Worcester sauce, a raw egg, and red pepper according to Jeeves, though Bertie suspects that the drink consists of more than that.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 48. Wodehouse mentions other ingredients in a personal letter he wrote late in his life, though these ingredients are not referred to in the stories.Wodehouse (2011), P. G. Wodehouse: A Life in Letters, p. 541. Wodehouse wrote: \"Jeeves's bracer does not contain dynamite as is generally supposed. It consists of lime juice, a lump of sugar, and one teaspoonful of Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo. This, it will be remembered, is the amount of the Buck-U-Uppo given to elephants in India to enable them to face tigers on tiger hunts with the necessary nonchalance.\" Additionally, Jeeves is capable of typing and writing shorthand.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 10, and chapter 16, p. 183.", "Jeeves has knowledge in more dubious subjects as well. He is well-informed about how to steal paintings and kidnap dogs.Wodehouse (1993) [1959], A Few Quick Ones, chapter 4, p. 79. Jeeves tells Bertie how to steal a painting with treacle and brown paper, and says that this is \"the recognized method in vogue in the burgling industry\".Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 5, pp. 125\u2013126. Jeeves tells Bertie how to lure a dog using aniseed, and says that it is extensively used in the dog-stealing industry. He uses a Mickey Finn to incapacitate the unscrupulous Bingley.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 11, p. 123. Capable of action when the situation calls for it, Jeeves uses a golf club to knock out Sippy Sipperley in \"The Inferiority Complex of Old Sippy\", and takes down a swan with a raincoat and boathook in \"Jeeves and the Impending Doom\". He finds it necessary to get Aunt Dahlia to knock out Bertie with a gong stick in \"Jeeves Makes an Omelette\", though he agrees with Bertie not to use this sort of tactic again.Wodehouse (1993) [1959], A Few Quick Ones, chapter 4, p. 89.Thompson (1992), p. 131. \"Certainly Jeeves never uses violence against Bertie, though he does\u2014regretfully\u2014get Aunt Dahlia to knock him out as part of the solution in 'Jeeves Makes an Omelet'.\" After Jeeves uses a cosh to knock out Constable Dobbs in The Mating Season, an astonished Bertie describes Jeeves as \"something that would be gratefully accepted as a muscle guy by any gang on the lookout for new blood\".Wodehouse (2008) [1949], The Mating Season, chapter 24, p. 235.", "Jeeves often reads intellectual, \"improving\" books, including the works of Spinoza, Shakespeare, and \"Dostoevsky and the great Russians\".Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 72. Bertie says, \"'You want me to recommend you a good book? Well, of course, it depends on what you like. Jeeves, for instance, is never happier than when curled up with his Spinoza or his Shakespeare.'\"Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 1, p. 11. \"'My personal tastes lie more in the direction of Dostoevsky and the great Russians.'\" He also enjoys the works of romance novelist Rosie M. Banks,Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 19. and regularly reads The Times, which Bertie occasionally borrows to try the crossword puzzle.Wodehouse (2008) [1960], Jeeves in the Offing, chapter 2, p. 25. In \"Jeeves in the Springtime\", he went dancing in Camberwell, where he was seen by Bertie's friend Bingo Little. Bingo says that he saw Jeeves \"swinging a dashed efficient shoe\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 15. Once a week, Jeeves takes the afternoon off to play bridge at his club, the Junior Ganymede.Wodehouse (1968) [1966], Plum Pie, chapter 1, p. 32.", "One of Jeeves's hobbies is fishing, which he tends to do during his annual summer holiday, typically taken at Bognor Regis. Bertie sees him fishing in Joy in the Morning.Wodehouse (2008) [1947], Joy in the Morning, chapter 20, p. 184. Appreciating travel in general, Jeeves wants to go on a cruise in two different stories, \"The Spot of Art\" and The Code of the Woosters. Jeeves claims that travel is educational, though Bertie suspects that Jeeves has a Viking strain and \"yearns for the tang of the salt breezes\".Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 1, p. 9. Jeeves occasionally enjoys gambling, which is the reason he wishes to go to Monte Carlo in \"Jeeves and the Yule-tide Spirit\".", "The premise of the Jeeves stories is that the brilliant valet is firmly in control of his rich and unworldly young employer's life. Jeeves becomes Bertie Wooster's guardian and all-purpose problem solver, devising subtle plans to help Bertie and his friends with various problems. In particular, Jeeves extricates Bertie Wooster from engagements to formidable women whom Bertie reluctantly becomes engaged to, Bertie being unwilling to hurt a woman's feelings by turning her down. While Jeeves wants to keep Bertie from a fianc\u00e9e whom he believes will not make Bertie happy, Jeeves also wants to keep his position, which he feels would be threatened by a wife.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 36. In \"Jeeves Takes Charge\", Bertie fires Jeeves after Jeeves causes Florence to end her engagement to Bertie. Jeeves explains his actions: \"'As I am no longer in your employment, sir, I can speak freely without appearing to take a liberty. In my opinion you and Lady Florence were quite unsuitably matched... You would not have been happy, sir!'\"Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 10, p. 256. Upset that Bertie appears to be contemplating marriage, Jeeves states that, in his experience, \"when the wife comes in at the front door the valet of bachelor days goes out at the back\". Jeeves also provides assistance when Bertie, who refuses to let a pal down, gets drawn into trouble trying to help a friend or a relative he is fond of. Bertie is usually unaware of the extent of Jeeves's machinations until all is revealed at the end of the story. On one occasion, Bertie acknowledges and accepts his role as a pawn in Jeeves's grand plan, though Jeeves objects, saying that he could have accomplished nothing without Bertie's cooperation.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 22, pp. 259\u2013260.", "For the most part, Bertie and Jeeves are on good terms. Being fond of Bertie, Jeeves considers their connection \"pleasant in every respect\".Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 10, pp. 256 and 266. Bertie says that he looks on Jeeves as \"a sort of guide, philosopher, and friend\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 10. This is a reference to a poem by Alexander Pope. At times when Bertie is separated from Jeeves, Bertie is miserable. When Bertie must stay by himself in a hotel in \"The Aunt and the Sluggard\", he struggles without having Jeeves there to press his clothes and bring him tea, saying \"I don't know when I've felt so rotten. Somehow I found myself moving about the room softly, as if there had been a death in the family\"; he later cheers himself up by going round the cabarets, though \"the frightful loss of Jeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery\".Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 5, pp. 125\u2013126 and 130. In Thank You, Jeeves, when Jeeves has left Bertie's employment because of their disagreement over a banjolele, Bertie still seeks Jeeves for help and Jeeves comes to his aid.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 15, p. 173. Bertie dislikes when Jeeves goes on his annual holiday, stating, \"without this right-hand man at his side Bertram Wooster becomes a mere shadow his former self\".Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 1, p. 8. Jeeves appreciates the praise that Bertie bestows on him, saying that \"Mr. Wooster has always been gratifyingly appreciative of my humble efforts on his behalf\".Wodehouse (2008) [1953], Ring for Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 61.", "Jeeves has firm ideas about how an English gentleman should dress and behave, and sees it as his duty to ensure that his employer presents himself appropriately. When friction arises between Jeeves and Bertie, it is usually over some new item about which Bertie Wooster is enthusiastic that does not meet with Jeeves's approval, such as bright purple socks, a white mess jacket, or a garish vase. Bertie becomes attached to these less conservative pieces and views Jeeves's opposition to them as \"hidebound and reactionary\",Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 1, pp. 20\u201321. marking him \"an enemy to Progress\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 16, p. 210. This type of disagreement results in a period of coolness between them. The conflict is resolved by the end of the story, typically after Jeeves has helped Bertie with his latest problem. Bertie, grateful, agrees to have it Jeeves's way. He does not object if he learns that Jeeves, foreseeing that Bertie would agree to give up the item, has already disposed of it.", "Bertie considers Jeeves to be a marvel, and wonders why Jeeves is content to work for him, stating, \"It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied to hang around pressing my clothes and what not\".Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 2, p. 45. Jeeves has been offered twice the salary Bertie pays him by another gentleman, but still remains with Bertie.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 84. Jeeves views Bertie as being friendly but mentally negligible, though his opinion of Bertie's intelligence seems to improve over time. In an early story, he says that Bertie is \"an exceedingly pleasant and amiable young gentleman, but not intelligent. By no means intelligent. Mentally he is negligible \u2013 quite negligible.\"Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 55. Hearing this spurs Bertie to try to solve problems on his own, though he ultimately fails and needs Jeeves's assistance. Nonetheless, Jeeves's view of Bertie's intelligence has apparently softened by the first novel, when Jeeves says that Bertie \"is, perhaps, mentally somewhat negligible, but he has a heart of gold\".Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 82. At one point in the ninth novel, Jeeves actually commends Bertie's quick thinking, saying that Bertie's tactic of hiding from an antagonist behind a sofa \"showed a resource and swiftness of thought which it would be difficult to overpraise\".Wodehouse (2008) [1963], Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, chapter 21, p. 178.", "Jeeves's name is used as a synonym for a personal manservant. A \"Jeeves\" is a generic term for a model valet or butler according to the  Oxford English DictionaryCawthorne (2013), pp. 169\u2013170. \"Jeeves has achieved the ultimate accolade: his own entry in the Oxford English Dictionary, where he is 'the perfect valet, used allusively'. 'Jeevesian' and 'Jeeves-like' also appear.\" and the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. It can mean a \"resourceful helper\" according to the Encarta World English Dictionary. In a comedy routine in a 1993 Seinfeld episode, Jerry Seinfeld said, \"Did you ever notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves? I think when you name a baby Jeeves; you've pretty much mapped out his future. Not much chance he's gonna be a hitman.\"", "From 1996 until 2006, Ask.com, a question-and-answer search engine, was known as Ask Jeeves and featured a caricature of a butler on its launch page.

With minor exceptions, the short stories were written and published first (between 1915 and 1930); the novels later (between 1934 and 1974). While the series of stories featuring the character of Jeeves are often referred to as the \"Jeeves\" stories, the series is also called by other names such as the \"Jeeves and Wooster\" or \"Jeeves and Bertie\" stories.", "Bertie Wooster narrates (in the first person) all the stories but two, \"Bertie Changes His Mind\" (which Jeeves himself narrates in the first person), and Ring for Jeeves (which features Jeeves but not Bertie Wooster and is written in the third person).", "Jeeves and Bertie first appeared in \"Extricating Young Gussie\", a short story published in the US in September 1915, though it was not seen in the UK until 1916. In the story, Jeeves's character is minor and not fully developed, and Bertie's surname appears to be Mannering-Phipps.

The novels generally mention characters and events that happened in previous stories. Another way of reading most of the Jeeves canon is to read the short story collections The Inimitable Jeeves, Carry On, Jeeves, and Very Good, Jeeves, followed by the novels. While Carry On, Jeeves features some earlier stories, it also includes stories that occur after events in The Inimitable Jeeves.", "The Jeeves stories are described as occurring within a few years of each other. For example, Bertie states in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (1954) that his Aunt Dahlia has been running her paper Milady's Boudoir, first introduced in \"Clustering Round Young Bingo\" (1925), for about three years.Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 5, p. 45. However, there are inconsistencies between the stories that make it difficult to construct a timeline. For instance, it is stated in Jeeves in the Offing that Aunt Dahlia ran her paper for four years, and not three, as is shown in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit. Nonetheless, some scholars have attempted to create a rough timeline. J. H. C. Morris suggested that the Jeeves canon spanned approximately five years, stating that four Christmases are accounted for, and another must have passed during Bertie's time in America in the early stories, making five in all.Morris (1981), p. 4. Kristin Thompson also suggested that approximately five years passed during the stories, though Thompson instead relied on explicit references to time passed between events in the series.Thompson (1992), pp. 340\u2013341.", "The stories follow a floating timeline, with each story being set at the time it was written, while the characters do not change and past events are referred to as happening recently. This results in the stories following \"two kinds of time\", as the characters hardly age but are seen against the background of a changing world.French (1966), p. 95. This floating timeline allows for comedic references to films, songs, and politicians that would have been well known to readers when the stories were written. For example, in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit (1954), when Bertie is surprised to hear that his Aunt Dahlia wants to sell her weekly paper, he remarks, \"It was like hearing that Rodgers had decided to sell Hammerstein.\"Thompson (1992), pp. 343\u2013344. \"Dozens of references to contemporary events and personalities give the series its second kind of time, with the world changing around the unaging characters.\" (This is a reference to Rodgers and Hammerstein, who created popular Broadway musicals in the 1940s and 1950s.) However, certain Edwardian era elements, such as aristocratic country houses and traditional gentlemen's clubs like the Drones Club, continue to be prevalent throughout the series, despite becoming less common in the real world.French (1966), p. 73. Several writers have described the Jeeves series as being set in the interwar period (1918\u20131939).", "The plots and dialogue of the Jeeves stories were strongly influenced by Wodehouse's experience writing for the stage, and the playlike quality of the stories is often comically exaggerated. For example, many stage comedies involve two sundered couples, and this number is increased to five for the plot of the Jeeves novel The Mating Season. Bertie frequently uses theatrical terminology to describe characters and settings. For instance, in Joy in the Morning, Bertie says that Lord Worplesdon's study \"proved to be what they call on the stage a 'rich interior', liberally equipped with desks, chairs, tables, carpets and all the usual fixings.\" Later in the same scene, when Worplesdon sends his butler to fetch Jeeves, Bertie says, \"During the stage wait, which was not of long duration, the old relative filled in with some ad lib stuff about Boko, mostly about how much he disliked his face\" (chapter 22).Thompson (1992), pp. 102\u2013103. The dialogue is sometimes written like in a script. For example, several lines of text in the first chapter of Right Ho, Jeeves are rendered in script format.Thompson (1992), p. 104.", "Wodehouse uses a number of what Kristin Thompson terms \"delaying devices\" to keep the competent Jeeves from solving problems too quickly. For example, Bertie sometimes cannot get help from Jeeves initially because Jeeves is away on vacation. In multiple stories, Jeeves delays solving Bertie's problem because he disapproves of an object Bertie has acquired.Thompson (1992), pp. 125\u2013127. Jeeves is shown to be a \"thoroughly pragmatic, occasionally Machiavellian figure\" who is willing to delay solving problems until it is advantageous for him to do so.Thompson (1992), p. 129. In some stories, Bertie insists on trying to handle problems himself. Jeeves, planning in the background, can estimate the extent of Bertie's mistakes in advance and incorporate them into his own plan in the end.", "Wodehouse has Jeeves consistently use a very formal manner of speaking, while Bertie's speech mixes formal and informal language. These different styles are frequently used to create humour in the stories, such as when Bertie has to translate Jeeves's erudite speech for one of his pals who is not familiar with Jeeves. An example of this occurs in \"The Artistic Career of Corky\", when Jeeves comes up with a plan to help Bertie's friend Corky. Jeeves says his plan \"cannot fail of success\" but has a drawback in that it \"requires a certain financial outlay\". Bertie explains to Corky that Jeeves means \"he has got a pippin of an idea, but it's going to cost a bit\".Hall (1974), p. 91\u201394.", "Jeeves often tells Bertie about his machinations at the end of the stories, but does not always reveal everything to Bertie. This can be seen in the only story narrated by Jeeves, \"Bertie Changes His Mind\", in which Jeeves manipulates events without telling Bertie. The reader can infer some of Jeeves's offstage activity from subtle clues in Bertie's narrative. For example, in \"Jeeves and the Kid Clementina\", Bertie ends up in a tree while trespassing as part of a task outlined by the mischievous Bobbie Wickham, and is confronted by a policeman. The only information given to the reader about how the policeman got there is when he says, \"We had a telephone call at the station saying there was somebody in Miss Mapleton's garden.\" After reading the story, the reader can look back and infer that Jeeves called the police himself or got someone else to do it, knowing the incident would ultimately make Bertie seem heroic to Miss Mapleton and would make Bertie realize the dangers of Bobbie's scheming.Thompson (1992), p. 155.", "* The World of Wooster (30 May 1965 to 17 November 1967, 20 episodes of 30 minutes) was a half-hour comedy series for BBC1, with Dennis Price as Jeeves, and Ian Carmichael as Bertie Wooster.", "* In the 1970s and 1980s, Jeeves and Bertie Wooster were portrayed by various actors in twelve commercials for Croft Original Sherry.

G. Wodehouse. An amiable English gentleman and one of the \"idle rich\", Bertie appears alongside his valet, Jeeves, whose intelligence manages to save Bertie or one of his friends from numerous awkward situations. Bertie Wooster and Jeeves have been described as \"one of the great comic double-acts of all time\".", "Bertie is the narrator and central figure of most of the Jeeves short stories and novels. The two exceptions are the short story \"Bertie Changes His Mind\" (1922), which is narrated by Jeeves, and the novel Ring for Jeeves (1953), a third-person narration in which Bertie is mentioned but does not appear. First appearing in \"Extricating Young Gussie\" in 1915, Bertie is the narrator of ten novels and over 30 short stories, the last being the novel Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, published in 1974.", "Bertie Wooster and his friend Bingo Little were born in the same village only a few days apart. Bertie's middle name, \"Wilberforce\", is the doing of his father, who won money on a horse named Wilberforce in the Grand National the day before Bertie's christening and insisted on his son carrying that name.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 9, p. 92. The only other piece of information given about Bertie's father, aside from the fact that he had numerous relatives, is that he was a great friend of Lord Wickhammersley of Twing Hall. Bertie refers to his father as his \"guv'nor\".Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimtiable Jeeves, chapter 13, p. 139.", "When he was around seven years of age, Bertie was sometimes compelled to recite \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" for guests by his mother; she proclaimed that he recited nicely, but Bertie disagrees, and says that he and others found the experience unpleasant.Wodehouse (2008) [1954], Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, chapter 13, p. 123. Bertie also mentions reciting other poems as a child, including \"Ben Battle\" and works by Walter Scott. Like Jeeves, Bertie says that his mother thought him intelligent.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 128. Bertie talks with Jeeves: \"'Tell me, were you always like this, or did it come on suddenly?' 'Sir?' 'The brain. The grey matter. Were you an outstandingly brilliant boy?' 'My mother thought me intelligent, sir.' 'You can't go by that. My mother thought me intelligent.'\" Bertie makes no other mention of his mother, though he makes a remark about motherhood after being astounded by a friend telling a blatant lie: \"And this, mark you, a man who had had a good upbringing and had, no doubt, spent years at his mother's knee being taught to tell the truth\".Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 4, p. 109.", "Bertie Wooster's early education took place at the semi-fictional Malvern House Preparatory School, headed by Rev. Aubrey Upjohn, whom he meets again in Jeeves in the Offing. (Wodehouse himself attended a school by that name, in Kearsney, Kent, but the Malvern House that appears in the stories is in the fictional town of Bramley-on-Sea.) At Malvern House, Bertie's friends called him \"Daredevil Bertie\", though Upjohn and others called him \"Bungling Wooster\".Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 5, p. 114. Gussie Fink-Nottle says that Bertie was called \"Daredevil Bertie\" as a boy at school, and Bertie confirms this.Wodehouse (2008) [1960], Jeeves in the Offing, chapter 4, p. 41. Aubrey Upjohn says, \"'Bungling Wooster we used to call him'\".", "One detail of Bertie's Malvern House life that comes into several stories is his winning of the prize for scripture knowledge. Bertie speaks with pride of this achievement on several occasions, but in Right Ho, Jeeves, his friend Gussie Fink-Nottle, while intoxicated, publicly accuses Bertie of having won the award by cheating. Bertie stoutly denies this charge, however, and on the same occasion, Gussie makes other completely groundless accusations against other characters. Despite his pride over his accomplishment, Bertie does not remember precisely what the prize was, simply stating that it was \"a handsomely bound copy of a devotional work whose name has escaped me\".Wodehouse (2008) [1974], Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, chapter 7, p. 65.", "Bertie once won a prize at private school for the best collection of wildflowers made during the summer holidays.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 2, pp. 24\u201325. When Bertie was fourteen, he won the Choir Boys' Handicap bicycle race at a local school treat, having received half a lap start.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Right Ho, Jeeves, chapter 22, p. 270.", "Bertie is a member of the Drones Club, and most of his friends and fellow Drones members depicted in the stories attended one or both of these institutions with him. It was at Oxford that he first began celebrating the night of the annual Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge. Though ordinarily he drinks in moderation, Bertie says he is \"rather apt to let myself go a bit\" on Boat Race night, typically drinking more than usual and making mischief with his old school friends.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 7, pp. 169\u2013172. Specifically, Bertie and others tend to celebrate the occasion by stealing a policeman's helmet, though they often get arrested as a result. London magistrates are aware of this tradition and tend to be lenient towards Bertie when he appears in court the morning after the Boat Race, generally only imposing a fine of five pounds; while this would have constituted a significant amount of money for many people at the time, Bertie has no trouble paying it.", "The Jeeves canon is set in a floating timeline (with each story being set at the time when it was written though the characters do not age), in an idealized world where wars are downplayed or not mentioned. Certain Edwardian era elements, such as traditional gentlemen's clubs like the Drones Club, continue to be prevalent throughout the stories.", "With a few exceptions, the short stories were written first, followed by the novels. The saga begins chronologically in the short story \"Jeeves Takes Charge\", in which Bertie Wooster first hires Jeeves. Bertie and Jeeves usually live at Berkeley Mansions, though they also go to New York and numerous English country houses. Throughout the short stories and novels, Bertie tries to help his friends and relatives, but ends up becoming entangled in trouble himself, and is ultimately rescued by Jeeves. Typically, Bertie has a new piece of clothing or item that Jeeves disapproves of, though Bertie agrees to relinquish it at the end of the story.", "Almost always narrating the story, Bertie becomes involved in many complex and absurd situations. He appears in the one short story he does not narrate, \"Bertie Changes His Mind\", and does not make an appearance in Ring for Jeeves, though he is mentioned. An important story for Bertie is \"Clustering Round Young Bingo\", in which Bertie writes an article titled \"What the Well-Dressed Man is Wearing\" for his Aunt Dahlia's weekly magazine, Milady's Boudoir. For his article, Aunt Dahlia paid Bertie a packet of cigarettes.Garrison (1991), pp. 219\u2013221. As with his prize for scripture knowledge, Bertie is proud of this article and mentions it many times. Two other events that are particularly significant for Bertie are his short-lived interest in living with his nieces in \"Bertie Changes His Mind\" and his temporary separation from Jeeves when Bertie refused to stop playing his banjolele in Thank You, Jeeves.", "On several occasions, Bertie assumes an alias. After being arrested on Boat Race night, he calls himself Eustace H. Plimsoll when appearing in court (in Thank You, Jeeves and Right Ho, Jeeves). He is also brought to court after tripping a policeman in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, and calls himself Ephraim Gadsby. In one scene in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, he is said to be a thief named Alpine Joe, which is mentioned again in Aunts Aren't Gentlemen. He also impersonates three other people in different stories, namely Rosie M. Banks in \"Jeeves in the Springtime\" and \"Bingo and the Little Woman\", Oliver \"Sippy\" Sipperley in \"Without the Option\", and Gussie Fink-Nottle in The Mating Season.Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 129.", "In Ring for Jeeves, set in post-WWII England, Bertie attends a school that teaches the aristocracy basic skills, including boot-cleaning, sock-darning, bed-making and primary-grade cooking. This school does not allow its students to employ valets, so Jeeves cannot follow Bertie there and instead works as a butler for Lord Rowcester.Wodehouse (2008) [1953], Ring for Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 61. However, Bertie is eventually expelled for cheating after he pays a woman to do his sock darning, and Jeeves returns to his side.", "Bertie is approximately 24 years old when he first meets Jeeves in \"Jeeves Takes Charge\".Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 1. Bertie recounts a story in which he was fifteen years old, and later mentions that this story occurred nine years before, meaning that he is approximately 24 years old in \"Jeeves Takes Charge\". His age is not stated in any other story. In the reference work Wodehouse in Woostershire by Wodehouse scholars Geoffrey Jaggard and Tony Ring, it is speculated that Bertie's age ranges from approximately 24 to 29 over the course of the stories.Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 124\u2013126. Nigel Cawthorne, author of A Brief Guide to Jeeves and Wooster, also suggested that Bertie is approximately 29 at the end of the saga.Cawthorne (2013), p. 160.", "Tall and slim, Bertie is elegantly dressed, largely because of Jeeves.Cawthorne (2013), p. 159. He has blue eyes.Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 21, p. 256. Chuffy references Bertie's \"big blue eyes\". Normally clean-shaven, he grows a moustache in two different stories, and ultimately loses the moustache, as Jeeves does not think a moustache suits Bertie. It seems that he has an innocent-looking appearance; when Bertie wants to wear an alpine hat in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, he states, \"I was prepared to concede that it would have been more suitable for rural wear, but against this had to be set the fact that it unquestionably lent a diablerie to my appearance, and mine is an appearance that needs all the diablerie it can get.\"Wodehouse (2008) [1963], Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 15. Bertie has an expressive face that Jeeves can read easily.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 10, p. 271. Jeeves narrates: \"Mr. Wooster's is not one of those inscrutable faces which it is impossible to read. On the contrary, it is a limpid pool in which is mirrored each passing emotion. I could read it now like a book\".", "In illustrations, Bertie Wooster has frequently been depicted wearing a monocle. However, this is probably merely a stereotypical depiction of an upper-class gentleman, as Bertie does not seem to wear a monocle in the original stories. The only evidence of Bertie wearing a monocle occurs in \"The Spot of Art\", when Bertie sees a portrait of himself, wearing a monocle, in a poster advertising soup. Bertie is revolted by the image, which gives him a look of \"bestial greed\". The monocle seems to exaggerate this expression, and Bertie makes fun of how large the monocle looks, calling it \"about six inches in circumference\".Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 6, pp. 158\u2013159. Bertie is never described as wearing a monocle elsewhere. It is unlikely that Bertie would wear a monocle that would not be mentioned, since the glasses of other characters, particularly Bertie's friend Gussie Fink-Nottle, are well-described, and another prominent Wodehouse character, Psmith, has a distinctive monocle that is mentioned many times.Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 289\u2013290.", "Bertie is pleasant and amiable, according to Jeeves.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 55. A well-intentioned and honorable young gentleman, he has a strong moral code and prides himself on helping his friends.Usborne (2003), pp. 57 and 70. Unlike his Aunt Agatha, he is not snobbish to servants and is not bothered when one of his pals wants to marry someone from a different social class. He gladly spends time with a variety of people, including rich aristocrats and poor artists.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 2, pp. 39\u201340.", "Tending to be unworldly and naive, Bertie is tricked by con artists in \"Aunt Agatha Takes the Count\" and \"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\", though Jeeves could have warned him earlier on during the former occasion and he was driven by desperation in the latter circumstances; in Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, he realizes he is being tricked by a man named Graham, but is unable to avoid paying Graham anyway. He is not interested in global affairs or politics, and advises Jeeves to miss as many political debates as possible in order to live a happy and prosperous life.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 15, p. 176. Usually modest about his intelligence, Bertie states, \"I know perfectly well that I've got, roughly speaking, half the amount of brain a normal bloke ought to possess\",Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 184. though he occasionally wants to prove his intelligence, for example in \"Scoring off Jeeves\". He comes up with well-intentioned if ill-advised or unfortunately botched schemes, such as when he decides to kiss Pauline Stoker to spur his friend Chuffy to propose to her in Thank You, Jeeves.", "Sometimes, Bertie acts diffidently, giving in to the whims of his formidable aunts or fianc\u00e9es, but there are also times when Bertie displays a strong will, for example when he attempts to defy Jeeves's wishes on clothing, and when he resolves to confront Aunt Agatha at the end of The Mating Season. Nonetheless, Bertie lacks what Jeeves calls \"Presence\" and has difficulty presenting himself with authority in front of an audience.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves chapter 10, pp. 267\u2013268. On two occasions, Bertie mentions reluctantly playing a part in an amateur theatrical production at a country house, once when roped into playing a butler,Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 6, pp. 66\u201368. Bertie recounts that, years ago, he had been roped in to play the part of a butler in amateur theatricals at a country-house party.Wodehouse (2008) [1949], The Mating Season, chapter 17, p. 166. Bertie mentions the unpleasant feeling you get when you get roped into playing \"Bulstrode, a butler\" in amateur theatricals and you forget your lines. and another time when compelled to play King Edward III at his Aunt Agatha's house; for Bertie, both times were a trying ordeal.", "By no means an ambitious man, Bertie seeks neither a prestigious job nor a socially advantageous marriage. In his own words, Bertie is the sort of person who is \"content just to exist beautifully\".Wodehouse (2008) [1974], Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, chapter 1, p. 14. He likes living a leisurely, quiet life and appreciates small things in his day, such as the oolong tea (which he sometimes calls Bohea) that Jeeves brings to him every morning.Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 1, chapter 9, p. 92, and chapter 10, p. 111. Bertie also refers to his tea as \"oolong\" or \"Bohea\" in Very Good, Jeeves chapter 3, Right Ho, Jeeves chapter 4, and Joy in the Morning chapter 5. Bertie never refers to his tea as anything other than \"oolong\" or \"Bohea\".", "Bertie participates in a number of physical activities. He likes swimming under ordinary circumstances; he is less fond of it when he falls into water unexpectedly while dressed in regular attire, which occurs multiple times in the stories. He plays tennis with Bingo Little in \"Jeeves and the Impending Doom\". Bertie also plays golf in the same story.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 22. His golf handicap is 16, and he plays in the Drones Club golf tournament every year.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 163. At Oxford, he obtained a blue for rackets playing with his friend Harold \"Beefy\" Anstruther, and briefly went in for rowing under the coaching of Stilton Cheesewright.Ring & Jaggard (1999), pp. 287\u2013288. Later, he rows a boat that Jeeves is steering in \"Jeeves and the Impending Doom\". Bertie plays squash and was runner-up one year in the Drones Club Annual Squash Handicap.Wodehouse (2008) [1930], Very Good, Jeeves, chapter 3, p. 69. There is no doubt in his mind that he will win the Drones Club darts competition in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit. Claiming that he can \"out-Fred the nimblest Astaire\" Bertie enjoys dancing and likes fancy dress balls.Wodehouse (2008) [1947], Joy in the Morning, chapter 5, p. 46. Bertie states that \"as a dancer I out-Fred the nimblest Astaire, and fancy dress binges have always been my dish\".", "Capable of reading sheet music, Bertie has a light baritone voice and sings often, most prominently in \"Jeeves and the Song of Songs\".Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 287. He keeps a piano in his flat,Wodehouse (1968) [1966], Plum Pie, \"Jeeves and the Greasy Bird\", p. 42. and once played \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" with one finger on the piano at Totleigh Towers when there was no other method of self-expression available.Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 10, p. 210. Relieved after Madeline Bassett leaves the room to retrieve Gussie's notebook, Bertie says, \"She hurried out, and I sat down at the piano and began to play 'Happy Days Are Here Again' with one finger. It was the only method of self-expression that seemed to present itself.\" In Thank You, Jeeves, he attempts to play the banjolele, apparently with little success despite his enthusiasm. In an early story, Bertie claims that \"bar a weekly wrestle with the 'Pink 'Un' and an occasional dip into the form book I'm not much of a lad for reading\",Wodehouse (2008) [1923], The Inimitable Jeeves, chapter 17, p. 236. yet Bertie is frequently in the middle of reading a mystery or crime novel in later stories. He states that he is never happier than when curled up with the latest Agatha Christie,Wodehouse (2008) [1974], Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, chapter 8, p. 83. and regularly references literary characters in mystery and crime fiction, including Christie's Hercule Poirot and others such as Sherlock Holmes, A. J. Raffles, and Nero Wolfe.", "===Jeeves===", "When Bertie Wooster catches his valet Meadowes stealing his silk socks among other things, he sacks him and sends for another from the agency. Jeeves arrives and mixes Bertie a hangover cure. The cure is remarkably effective, and Bertie engages Jeeves immediately.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 1, pp. 11\u201313. Thereafter, Bertie happily cedes much of the control of his life to the competent Jeeves, despite the occasional clashes that sometimes occur \"when two men of iron will live in close association\", according to Bertie.Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 1, p. 8. These clashes generally occur because Bertie insists on wearing a new jacket, tie, or some other item that Jeeves disapproves of, though Bertie agrees to give up the item after Jeeves saves him from trouble.", "Due to the volume of stories and time span over which Wodehouse wrote them, there are a number of inconsistencies and contradictions in the information given about his relatives.  Bertie and several of his relations appear in the early semi-canonical short story \"Extricating Young Gussie\". In that story the family name is Mannering-Phipps, not Wooster, and the story has been excluded from most collections of Jeeves and Wooster material, even though the incidents in that story are referenced in later stories.", "The family members who make an appearance in the most Jeeves stories are Bertie's Aunt Dahlia (7 short stories, 7 novels) and Aunt Agatha (8 short stories). Aunt Dahlia is friendly and good-natured while Aunt Agatha is cold and haughty, though both make demands of Bertie. Bertie feels obliged to follow their whims, often getting in trouble doing so. Aunt Dahlia's husband Tom Travers and children Angela and Bonzo Travers play important roles. Spenser Gregson, Aunt Agatha's first husband, does not play a major role, but their son Thomas \"Thos\" Gregson and later her second husband Percy Craye, Earl of Worplesdon appear in the stories.", "Aside from Aunts Dahlia and Agatha, Bertie Wooster's father had other siblings. In \"Extricating Young Gussie\", Bertie's Uncle Cuthbert is described as the \"late head of the family\", but it is said his son Gussie has no title; Cuthbert's widow is Bertie's Aunt Julia. Another uncle is Uncle Willoughby, upon whom Bertie is initially financially dependent. One of Bertie's uncles, the late Henry Wooster, was the husband of Bertie's Aunt Emily; Claude and Eustace are their twin sons and Bertie's cousins. In \"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\", Bertie takes a present for another of Aunt Emily's sons, Harold, who has just turned six, but, embarrassed at the relatively inexpensive gift he had bought, Bertie wrenches his Uncle James's card off a toy aeroplane, replacing it with his own.Carry On, Jeeves Bertie's Uncle George is Lord Yaxley, so if he inherited that title he is likely to be Bertie's eldest living uncle, and Bertie's paternal grandfather may have held the title as well. However, the relative ages of Bertie's father and remaining uncles are not delineated, so it is unclear whether Bertie or one of his male cousins is in line to inherit the peerage. It is theoretically possible that the title was a life peerage under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, but unlikely as Uncle George is described as having devoted his life to food and drink.", "In the story \"Bertie Changes His Mind\", Bertie mentions a sister who has three daughters, referred to by Jeeves as Mrs Scholfield, though his sister and nieces are not mentioned again.", "Bertie never marries, but frequently finds himself engaged. In an early story he attempts to become engaged to Gwladys Pendlebury, an artist who paints Bertie's portrait. In the early years, he is rather given to impulsive and short-lived infatuations, under the influence of which he proposes to Florence Craye (in \"Jeeves Takes Charge\", the fourth story in terms of publication and the first in the internal timeline of the books), to Pauline Stoker, and to Bobbie Wickham. In all of these cases, he rethinks the charms of the holy state and a \"lovely profile\" upon closer understanding of the personalities of the women in question.  Having already received a proposal from him, each woman assumes that she has an open invitation to marry Bertie whenever she has a spat with her current fianc\u00e9. Madeline Bassett and Honoria Glossop suffer from a similar delusion, though in each of their cases Bertie was attempting to plead the case of a friend (Gussie Fink-Nottle and Bingo Little respectively) but was misinterpreted as confessing his own love. In all of these cases, Bertie, who aims to be an honorable preux chevalier (valiant knight), feels he has to agree to the marriage, and relies on Jeeves to somehow end the engagement.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 10. \"If a girl thinks you're in love with her and says she will marry you, you can't very well voice a preference for being dead in a ditch. Not, I mean, if you want to regard yourself as a preux chevalier, as the expression is, which is always my aim.\" In the later stories and novels, Bertie regards engagement solely as a dire situation from which Jeeves must extricate him. In the last novel, Bertie acknowledges that his infatuations have all been short-lived.Wodehouse (2008) [1974], Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, chapter 2, p. 17. Bertie, about Orlo being annoyed at a policeman arresting the woman Orlo loves: \"I could understand how this might well have annoyed him. I have loved a fair number of women in my time, though it always seems to wear off after a while, and I should probably have drained the bitter cup a bit if I had seen any of them pinched by the police.\"", "In Thank You, Jeeves, Bertie states that he is glad he did not marry Pauline Stoker because she is \"one of those girls who want you to come and swim a mile before breakfast and rout you out when you are trying to snatch a wink of sleep after lunch for a merry five sets of tennis\", and adds that his ideal wife should be, in contrast to the dynamic Pauline, \"something rather more on the lines of Janet Gaynor\".Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 4, pp. 41\u201342. However, later in the same novel, Jeeves tells Pauline that he doubts a union between her and Bertie would have been successful as Bertie is \"essentially one of Nature's bachelors\".Wodehouse (2008) [1934], Thank You, Jeeves, chapter 18, p. 217.", "Though Jeeves frequently rescues Bertie from unwanted engagements, only rarely do they openly discuss the matter, as they both feel it would be unseemly to \"bandy a woman's name\" in such a way.Wodehouse (2008) [1971], Much Obliged, Jeeves, chapter 5, p. 35. \"Jeeves, you see, is always getting me out of entanglements with the opposite sex, and he knows all about the various females who from time to time have come within an ace of hauling me to the altar rails, but of course we don't discuss them. To do so, we feel, would come under the head of bandying a woman's name, and the Woosters do not bandy women's names. Nor do the Jeeveses.\"", "Of the women Bertie Wooster becomes engaged to, those who appear in the most Jeeves stories are Madeline Bassett (5 novels), Lady Florence Craye (1 short story, 3 novels), Bobbie Wickham (3 short stories, 1 novel), and Honoria Glossop (4 short stories).", "Bertie is loyal to his friends, willing to do whatever he can to solve their problems, saying \"when there is a chance of helping a pal we Woosters have no thought of self\".Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 6, p. 149. This has led to problems for him, since he is regularly drawn into troublesome tasks. Though he continues to provide help, Bertie is aware that people do not hesitate to give him unpleasant jobs; as he says, \"Whenever something sticky was afoot and action had to be taken the cry was sure to go up, 'Let Wooster do it.'\"Wodehouse (2008) [1974], Aunts Aren't Gentlemen, chapter 18, p. 167. Bertie's friends are eager to ask for advice from Jeeves, who enjoys helping Bertie's pals. Jeeves essentially runs a \"big Mayfair consulting practice\" from their home, and Bertie is accustomed to his acquaintances consulting Jeeves directly without talking to him first. Sometimes Bertie tries to assert that he can also solve problems, but truly he thinks of Jeeves as a genius as much as everyone else does.Usborne (2003), pp. 86, 93.", "Among Bertie's friends, those who appear in the most Jeeves stories are Bingo Little (10 short stories), Gussie Fink-Nottle (4 novels), and Tuppy Glossop (3 short stories, 1 novel). Others include Rev. Harold P. \"Stinker\" Pinker, Claude \"Catsmeat\" Potter-Pirbright, Oliver \"Sippy\" Sipperley, and Rockmetteller \"Rocky\" Todd. Sometimes a friend or acquaintance will become a jealous antagonist, for example G. D'Arcy \"Stilton\" Cheesewright.", "Some pals of Bertie's are occasionally mentioned who do not play major roles in the Jeeves stories, including Freddie Widgeon, Cyril \"Barmy\" Fotheringay-Phipps, and Oofy Prosser. Many Drones Club members appear in the separate Wodehouse Drones Club stories. Bertie is acquainted with Lord Emsworth, another of Wodehouse's best-known characters, who appears in the Blandings Castle stories.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 1, p. 19. Bertie also knows Lord Emsworth's son Freddie Threepwood.Wodehouse (2008) [1938], The Code of the Woosters, chapter 4, pp. 94\u201395.", "Among Bertie's various adversaries, those who appear in the most Jeeves stories are the \"nerve specialist\" or \"loony doctor\" Sir Roderick Glossop (4 short stories, 2 novels), and the intimidating \"amateur dictator\" Roderick Spode (4 novels), though Sir Roderick Glossop later becomes Bertie's friend. Other antagonists include Sir Watkyn Bassett and Major Plank.", "With two exceptions, the stories are told in the first person by Bertie Wooster. Although Jeeves occasionally describes Bertie as \"mentally negligible\", Bertie's narrative style reflects notable facility with the English language. He displays what would be considered by today's standards a broad, if not very deep, knowledge of English literature, making allusions from sources including the Bible, Shakespeare, and romantic literature of the 19th century (all of these references typical of the schooling he and his 20th-century audience received), even if he relies on Jeeves to complete quotations for him. Bertie frequently applies these serious references in an over-simplified, farcical manner to the situation he is in, or uses the reference in a way totally contrary to its original context and meaning. In one story, Bertie complains about the constant attentions of a woman in whom he has no interest by referring to her as \"young Sticketh-Closer-Than-a-Brother\" in an annoyed fashion.Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 7, p. 186. The verse (Proverbs 18:24) that Bertie partially quotes actually praises the value of close friendship when it refers to a \"friend that sticketh closer than a brother\".", "Bertie is fond of pre-World War I slang, peppering his speech with words and phrases such as \"what ho!\", \"pipped\", \"bally\" and so on, and he informally abbreviates words and phrases, such as \"eggs and b\" (eggs and bacon).
