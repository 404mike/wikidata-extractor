This period is chosen because it is when he wrote his most influential and \"much more complex interpretation of the Revolution than had hitherto prevailed amongst historians\".  Peter Jones elaborates that Lefebvre's take on the Revolution has three major emphases: the idea that the countryside peasantry actively participated in the Revolution, the idea that this participation was not significantly influenced by the bourgeoisie, and the idea that the peasants largely agreed on an anticapitalist way of thinking in the 1790s."]}, {"page": "Peter Jones", "response": ["Peter Jones or Pete Jones may refer to:", "*Peter Jones (actor) (1920\u20132000), English actor", "*Peter Jones (journalist) (1930\u20132015), British entertainment journalist and author", "*Peter Jones (drummer) (1963\u20132012), English musician, member of Crowded House", "*Peter Jones (British musician) (born 1980), British musician and radio presenter", "*Peter Rees Jones (1843\u20131905), Welsh businessman, founder of Peter Jones department store", "*Peter Jones (entrepreneur) (born 1966), British entrepreneur, founder of Phones International; star of BBC TV series Dragons' Den and judge on ABC's American Inventor", "*Peter Jones (Australian politician) (1933\u20132017), Australian politician in Western Australia", "*Peter Jones (surgeon) (1917\u20131984), British surgeon", "*Peter Jones (paediatrician) (born 1937), British paediatrician", "*Peter Jones (mathematician) (born 1952), American mathematician", "*Peter Jones (footballer, born 1937), English footballer", "*Peter Jones (footballer, born 1949), English footballer for Burnley and Swansea City", "*Peter Jones (referee) (born 1954), English football referee", "*Peter Jones (rugby union, born 1932) (1932\u20131994), New Zealand international rugby union player", "*Peter Jones (rugby league, Balmain) (born 1942), Australian rugby league player", "*Peter Jones (rugby league) (born 1972), Australian rugby league player", "*Peter Jones (sport shooter) (1879\u2013?), British Olympic shooter", "*Peter Jones (broadcaster) (1930\u20131990), Welsh broadcaster, BBC radio sports commentator", "*Peter Jones (cricketer, born 1935) (1935\u20132007), English cricketer, played for Kent and Suffolk", "*Peter Jones (Australian rules footballer) (born 1946), Australian rules footballer for Carlton", "*Peter Jones (cricketer, born 1948) (1948\u20132017), Rhodesian first-class cricketer for Oxford University", "*Peter Jones (missionary) (1802\u20131856), Mississauga Ojibwa Methodist minister, chief and missionary", "*Peter Jones (British Army officer) (1919\u20132015)", "*Peter Jones (classicist) (born 1942), British classicist, writer, journalist and broadcaster", "*Peter Jones (admiral) (born 1957), Royal Australian Navy officer", "*Peter Jones (historian), British professor of French history", "*Peter Jones (department store), English retail establishment"]}, {"page": "List of titles in Seminar Studies in History", "response": ["*The 1848 Revolutions.
