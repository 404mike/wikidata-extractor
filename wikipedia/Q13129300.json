She wrote in English and moved around England during her lifetime. She is particularly known for her poetry on religious subjects and on her headaches.\nShe suffered from monthly headaches which left her helpless for days. Based on the described symptoms in her works, modern biographers suspect that her health problems consisted of migraines.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Talgarth", "response": ["In 1735, Talgarth saw the birth of the Welsh Methodist revival when Howel Harris, probably the most influential person to come from Talgarth, was converted in Talgarth church while listening to a sermon by the Rev. Pryce Davies. The revival would sweep across Wales leading to the development of one of the most influential Welsh denominations, that of the Calvinistic Methodists. It was at Talgarth that William Williams Pantycelyn converted, leading him to become one of Wales' most important hymn writers. Nearby is Trevecca, the location of the famous college that Harris established. Hywel Harris is buried in Talgarth at St Gwendoline's Church and his tombstone is still visible today. Talgarth is also thought to be the birthplace of the religious poet Jane Cave.Isobel Grundy, \u2018Cave, Jane (b. 1754/5, d. in or before 1813)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 December 2015"]}, {"page": "1812 in poetry", "response": ["* November 27 (bur.) \u2013 Jane Cave (born c. 1754), Welsh"]}, {"page": "1783 in poetry", "response": ["* Jane Cave (later, Jane Wiscom), Poems on Various Subjects, Entertaining, Elegiac, and Religious"]}, {"page": "1754 in poetry", "response": ["* Earliest likely year \u2013 Jane Cave (died 1812), Welsh"]}, {"page": "1810s in Wales", "response": ["**date unknown - Jane Cave, poet (b. 1754)"]}, {"page": "1812 in Wales", "response": ["*27 November (bur.) - Jane Cave, poet, c. 58"]}, {"page": "1754 in Wales", "response": ["* earliest likely year - Jane Cave, poet (died 1812)"]}, {"page": "Jane Winscom", "response": ["#redirect Jane Cave"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Jane Cave (c.1754\u20131812), English-language poet"]}]}}
