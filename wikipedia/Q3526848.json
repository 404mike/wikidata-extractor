He was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys.\nFrom 1895 until 1912 he played for Leicestershire as a somewhat dour batsman in a generally weak team. He represented England in three matches of the 1903\u201304 Ashes series against Australia, with a highest score of 70 not out at Sydney. He had had his most successful domestic season in 1903, scoring 1834 runs at an average of 45.85, including his highest score of 229 not out against Worcestershire.A. A. Thomson saw his innings of 147 against Yorkshire at Sheffield when Leicestershire were following-on, made in his final season of 1912. He wrote: \"His batting was unencumbered by frills, but strong and solid, attuned to the difficulties of the situation. Albert was a man of admirable character and a Methodist local preacher.\"His most important contribution to the game was a book, The Complete Cricketer, published in 1906. Sir Derek Birley, in his A Social History of English Cricket, described it as \"a masterpiece of its kind, stuffed full of learned observations in weighty prose\". Wisden called it \"grandiose in style, containing much startling metaphor\".After retirement, Knight was cricket coach at Highgate School, where his portrait in oils was painted by the art teacher, Kyffin Williams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1903 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Colin Blythe, John Gunn, Albert Knight, Walter Mead, Plum Warner"]}, {"page": "Albert-Knight", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Knight (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Albert Knight"]}, {"page": "Walter Robins", "response": ["Robins was born in Stafford on 3 June 1906. His father was Vivian Harry Robins (1880\u20131963), who played Minor Counties cricket for Staffordshire before the First World War as a leg-break bowler and right-handed batsman \u2013 characteristics which his son would also develop. In 1917 the family moved to London, where Walter Robins attended Highgate School. He was coached at cricket first by his father, to whom he would later attribute much of his eventual success, and, at Highgate, by the former England player Albert Knight. He also played club cricket for East Molesey."]}, {"page": "Kyffin Williams", "response": ["Williams enrolled at London's Slade School of Fine Art in 1941 (relocated to Oxford during the war), gaining prizes for portraiture at the end of both his second and third years. He then achieved his ambition to teach art by accepting a position at Highgate School, London, where he was senior art master from 1944 until 1973. His pupils included the historian Sir Martin Gilbert, Royal Academicians Anthony Green and Patrick Procktor and composers John Tavener and John Rutter. He painted a portrait of the school's cricket coach, former test player Albert Knight. Wales never left his consciousness or imagination, as he would return home in holidays, take his study sketches back to London and complete his canvasses. Williams' particular technique was applying thick oil paint with a palette knife. Williams was predominately a landscape painter but he also was an accomplished portraitist and something of a cartoonist."]}, {"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Albert Knight", "|Albert Knight || 18,142"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Albert Knight \u00b7"]}, {"page": "A E Knight", "response": ["#REDIRECT Albert Knight (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "1903 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden \u2013 Colin Blythe, John Gunn, Albert Knight, Walter Mead, Plum Warner"]}, {"page": "Knight (surname)", "response": ["* Albert Knight (cricketer), English professional cricketer", "* Albert Knight (politician) (1817 \u2013 after 1881), merchant and political figure in Quebec", "* Albert Knight (diver) (1900\u20131964), British diver"]}, {"page": "Edward Righton senior", "response": ["Righton made his first-class debut in July 1911, playing against Leicestershire at Worcester.

Jayes and other bowlers, Wisden said, were \"expensive\": his 104 wickets in the season came at an average of 27.07. In terms of aggregate, this was his best season for batting, with 708 runs at an average of 19.13. The runs included his only first-class century, an innings of exactly 100 made in 105 minutes as part of a seventh-wicket stand of 158 with Albert Knight in the game against Warwickshire at Edgbaston. Three weeks later he was selected for the Players team in the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval, in a season without Test cricket one of the most important fixtures of the season."]}, {"page": "List of London County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Albert Knight : A.
