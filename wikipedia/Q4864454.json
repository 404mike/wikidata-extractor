On Stage he performed at the Comedy Theatre, London, in the Green Room Rags of 2 December 1934; opposite Ann Todd in the sketch Every Twenty Thousand Years.\nOther notable roles include Lieutenant Somerville in Brown on Resolution (1935) and as Fred, Scrooge's nephew, in MGM's film A Christmas Carol (1938), the latter being one of two films he made in the US; the other was the lead role in a B-picture, Smuggled Cargo (1939). After these films and serving in the Canadian navy during WW II, followed by stage work, there was a long gap in his film career until he reappeared as a character actor in the 1950s, making his last film (Timeslip a.k.a. The Atomic Man ) in 1955.Barry also appeared in the 1954 Sheldon Reynolds produced Sherlock Holmes television series.

Leo G. Carroll played Marley's Ghost.
