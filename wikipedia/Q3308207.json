Because in , God taught Moses Attributes that refer solely to God's works, Maimonides inferred that God had promised to give Moses a knowledge of God's works. Maimonides thus concluded that the ways that Moses wished to know, and which God taught him, were God's actions. Maimonides equated these with what the Sages called \"Attributes\" (, ), noting that the Talmud spoke of the 13 \"Attributes\" of God.Babylonian Talmud Rosh Hashanah 17b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli: Tractate Rosh Hashanah, elucidated by Abba Zvi Naiman, et al., volume 18, page 17b1. And the Mishnah also used the term in reference to man, saying, for example, \"There are four different sorts (, ) among those who go to the house of learning,\" and, \"There are four different traits (, ) among those who give charity.\"Mishnah Avot 5:13\u201314, in, e.g., Jacob Neusner, translator, Mishnah, pages 687\u201388. Maimonides argued that the Sages did not mean that God really possesses Attributes, but that God performs actions similar to human actions that in humans flow from certain Attributes and certain mental dispositions, whereas God has no such dispositions. Although Moses was shown all God's goodness, that is, all God's works,  mentions only the 13 Attributes, because they include those acts of God that refer to the creation and the government of mankind, and to know these acts was the principal object of the prayer of Moses. Maimonides found evidence for this in the conclusion of the prayer of Moses in , \"that I may know You, that I may find grace in Your sight, and consider that this nation is Your people.\" That is, Moses sought understanding of God's ways in governing the Israelites, so that Moses might act similarly. Maimonides concluded that \"the ways\" used in the Bible are identical with the \"Attributes\" used in the Mishnah, denoting the acts emanating from God in reference to the universe.Maimonides, Guide for the Perplexed, part 1, chapter 54 (Cairo, 1190), in, e.g., Moses Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, translated by Michael Friedl\u00e4nder (New York: Dover Publications, 1956), pages 75\u201376.", "*Maimonides.

Maimonides cited the ninth book of Aristotle's Ethics for the proposition that harvest festivals were a general custom, quoting Aristotle to report, \"In ancient times, the sacrifices and assemblies of the people took place after the ingathering of the corn and the fruit, as if the sacrifices were offered on account of the harvest.\" Maimonides noted the temperate nature of autumn as another reason for Sukkot falling in that season, making it possible to dwell in booths free of great heat and troublesome rain. Maimonides taught that Sukkot reminds Jews of the miracles that God performed in the wilderness, once again to induced Jews to thank God and lead a modest and humble life. Jews thus leave their houses to dwell in sukkot, as inhabitants of deserts do, so as to remember that this had once been their condition, as reported in , \"I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths.\" And Jews join to Sukkot the Feast of Shemini Atzeret to complete in the comfort of their homes their rejoicings, which cannot be perfect in booths. Maimonides taught that the lulav and etrog symbolize the rejoicing that the Israelites had when they replaced the wilderness, which was in the words of , \"no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates, or of water to drink,\" with a country full of fruit trees and rivers. To remember this, Jews take the most pleasant fruit of the land, branches that smell best, most beautiful leaves, and also the best of herbs, that is, the willows of the brook.

New York: Dover Publications, 1956. Maimonides taught that the object of the Sabbath (mentioned in ) was the rest that it affords. One-seventh of the life of every person, small or great, passes in comfort and rest from trouble and exertion. In addition, the Sabbath perpetuates remembrance of the Creation.Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, part 3, chapter 43, in, e.g., Moses Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, translated by Michael Friedl\u00e4nder, page 352.", "According to Maimonides, Passover (mentioned in ) is kept seven days, because a week is the intermediate unit of time between a day and a month. Passover teaches people to remember the miracles that God performed in Egypt, encouraging people to thank God repeatedly and to lead a modest and humble life. Jews therefore eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs on Passover in memory of what happened to the Israelites. And they eat unleavened bread for a week because if the eating were only for one day, Jews might not notice it.Maimonides.

According to Maimonides, Rosh Hashanah is a preparation for and an introduction to Yom Kippur, as is plain from the tradition about the days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, part 3, chapter 43, in, e.g., Moses Maimonides. The Guide for the Perplexed, translated by Michael Friedl\u00e4nder, page 353.", "Maimonides taught that Sukkot (discussed in ), which is a feast of rejoicing and gladness, is kept seven days, so that the festival may be more noticeable. It is kept in the autumn because, as  says, it is \"When you have gathered in your labors out of the field,\" and thus when people can rest free from pressing labors. Maimonides cited the ninth book of Aristotle's Ethics for the proposition that harvest festivals were a general custom, quoting Aristotle to report, \"In ancient times, the sacrifices and assemblies of the people took place after the ingathering of the corn and the fruit, as if the sacrifices were offered on account of the harvest.\" Maimonides noted the temperate nature of autumn as another reason for Sukkot falling in that season, making it possible to dwell in booths free of great heat and troublesome rain. Maimonides taught that Sukkot reminds Jews of the miracles that God performed in the wilderness, once again to induced Jews to thank God and lead a modest and humble life. Jews thus leave their houses to dwell in sukkot, as inhabitants of deserts do, so as to remember that this had once been their condition, as reported in  \"I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths.\" And Jews join to Sukkot the Feast of Shemini Atzeret to complete in the comfort of their homes their rejoicings, which cannot be perfect in booths. Maimonides taught that the lulav and etrog symbolize the rejoicing that the Israelites had when they replaced the wilderness, which was in the words of  \"no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates, or of water to drink,\" with a country full of fruit trees and rivers. To remember this, Jews take the most pleasant fruit of the land, branches that smell best, most beautiful leaves, and also the best of herbs, that is, the willows of the brook. The four species joined in the lulav and etrog also were (1) plentiful in those days in the Land of Israel, so that everyone could easily get them, (2) of a good appearance, and in the case of the etrog and myrtle, excellent smell, and (3) keep fresh and green for seven days.Maimonides, The Guide for the Perplexed, part 3, chapter 43, in, e.g., Moses Maimonides.
