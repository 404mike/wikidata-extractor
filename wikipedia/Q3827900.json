He wrote many of Grand Slam's songs together with Phil Lynott and Mark Stanway, some of which were released as Thin Lizzy songs. Archer was also a member of British band Wild Horses, Stampede, Lautrec, Medicine Head and Rhode Island Red with Gary Leiderman on bass (ex-Talk Talk, Thin Lizzy), Manolo Antonana on drums and frontman/actor/writer Mike Dyer.\nWhile Archer was in Stampede, the band recorded two albums for Polydor Records: The Official Bootleg and Hurricane Town. Before that, Archer was in Lautrec with his stepfather, singer Reuben Archer.\nStampede re-formed in 2009 in the wake of renewed interest and the CD re-issues of both The Official Bootleg and Hurricane Town via UK-based Rock Candy Records and Universal Music in Japan. The line-up consisted of original members Laurence Archer, Reuben Archer, and Colin Bond, with Steve Graystone replacing Eddie Parsons on drums, and new guitarist Chris Clowsley.\nIn 2011, Archer also began playing in the band X-UFO, alongside fellow former members of UFO, Danny Peyronel and Clive Edwards, with Rocky Newton (ex-McAuley Schenker Group) on bass.\nIn May 2016, Mark Stanway announced the reformation of Phil Lynott's Grand Slam together with Laurence Archer, Micky Barker, Neil Murray and Stefan Berggren.\nIn March 2019, Archer confirmed he was recording new material for Grandslam, with Mike Dyer, David Boyce, Benji Reid and Mark Stanway. On 30 August 2019, BBC Radio 2 played the world premiere of the new Grandslam single \"Gone are the Days\". Grand Slam\u2019s album, Hit the Ground, was released on 22 November 2019 via Marshall Records.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UFO (band)", "response": ["In 1991, Mogg and Way decided to put a new UFO line-up together with former Wild Horses members Clive Edwards on drums and Laurence Archer on guitar joining the band and released High Stakes & Dangerous Men. While only released on a small independent label, High Stakes was enough to generate serious interest in a full-blown reunion. The following year, the classic late-1970s UFO line-up \u2013 Mogg, Schenker, Way, Raymond and Parker \u2013 reunited, and the resulting album was Walk on Water (1995). This line-up (barring Parker's replacement by AC/DC's Simon Wright on drums) went on a world tour. However, tensions arose again, and Schenker left the band only four shows into the tour, walking off stage mid-set in the very same city, of Palo Alto, CA, where their October 1978 tour died. Thereafter, the other members again went their separate ways.  However, Schenker returned to the fold in 1998, in Michael Schenker Group, and the band embarked on another tour, with Parker again replaced by a new drummer. They played at the Astoria, Charing Cross Road, London in 1998.", "In 2011, former band members Danny Peyronel, Laurence Archer, and Clive Edwards teamed up with bassist Rocky Newton (ex-McAuley Schenker Group) to form a band entitled X-UFO.

The song dated from the Grand Slam days and had been originally written with guitarist Laurence Archer. Modern recording techniques were used to replace the guitar and drum tracks with new work by Downey and Gorham. Gary Moore had agreed to participate as well, but ultimately did not do so. The song charted in the UK at No.\u00a035 during early 1991, and No.\u00a02 in Ireland, and featured on another greatest hits compilation album, Dedication: The Very Best of Thin Lizzy, released in February of that year, which reached No.\u00a08 in the UK album chart.

In 1984, he formed a new band, Grand Slam, with Doish Nagle, Laurence Archer, Robbie Brennan and Mark Stanway.

During the tour, Clarkin's mother died and Clarkin himself became seriously ill, forcing the band to complete the tour without him. Laurence Archer was hired as a temporary guitar player. Clarkin had still not recovered when the tour was over, and it looked like the band would not be able to carry on. Stanway soon departed, followed by Gorin.
