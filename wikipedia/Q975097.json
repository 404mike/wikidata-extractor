The game proved more costly for Yeovil than merely a defeat with injuries to both Lewis Young, ankle ligament damage and Gozie Ugwu, recurrence of a hamstring injury, ruling them both out for the month of October, in an attempt to arrest this run of form and as cover for those injuries, on 4 October, Gary Johnson completed the loan signing of Republic of Ireland U21 striker Paddy Madden from Carlisle United. The move worked with immediate effect with Madden scoring a brace on his debut and Hayter adding a third in a 3\u20131 victory over Colchester United. The poor run of form though was reflected by the Colchester United match being the club's lowest ever Football League attendance of just 3,002. This improved performance led to a double nomination in the Football League's Team of the Week with Irish duo Madden and winger Sam Foley both represented. On 9 October, Yeovil's away Football League Trophy tie against Torquay United was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Plainmoor, with the match rescheduled for the following week on the following Saturday the winner of the tie was given the reward of a home Area Quarter-final tie against Wycombe Wanderers in the next round. Another encouraging performance away at league leaders Tranmere Rovers saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead after half an hour thanks to goals from Madden and Foley, but another second half collapse saw Tranmere comeback to win the game 3\u20132 with Yeovil's plight not aided by having Joe Edwards sent off for two yellow cards. In their rearranged tie on 16 October, Yeovil salvaged a 2\u20132 draw against Torquay United with a stoppage time equaliser from James Hayter, to add to his earlier goal, with Yeovil winning the tie 5\u20134 on penalties, having scored all five of their spot kicks and keeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch having saved Torquay's Thomas Cruise's effort. The victory confirming Yeovil's progress to the Area Quarter-final stage of the Football League Trophy, for the first time in five years, with a home tie against Wycombe Wanderers. An unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over a ten-man Bury followed courtesy of goals from Byron Webster and Foley, the performance of midfielder Korey Smith earned him recognition in the League One Team of the Week. That weekend in the draw for the FA Cup First Round Proper Yeovil were given an away tie against fellow League One side Preston North End, to be played on 3 November. On 23 October, with injuries continuing to hamper the squad young Jamaican-born midfielder Daniel Johnson joined the club on a month-long youth loan deal from Aston Villa. That evening Yeovil strolled to a 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden and a goal from top scorer Hayter who took his tally for the season to seven, Daniel Johnson made his debut as a second-half substitute but had the ignominy of giving away a penalty. Yeovil ended the month with a third consecutive victory this time a 1\u20130 away win against Crewe Alexandra thanks to a second goal in a week for defender Byron Webster, the result was also only Yeovil's second clean sheet in the League that season. After a two-month loan spell at AFC Wimbledon, defender Curtis Haynes-Brown returned to the club having made six appearances for the Dons. Webster's winning goal and the club's second league clean sheet of the season led to his inclusion in the Football League's Team of the Week."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["|21||  || DF || Thomas Cruise || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "Thomas Daniel Cruise", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Cruise (footballer)"]}]}}
