He was the lieutenant-governor of Grenada from 1833 to 1835.\nMiddlemore was the first governor of Saint Helena from 1836 to 1842 after its handover from the British East India Company to the Crown.  He oversaw the repatriation of Napoleon's remains from there in 1840. He was succeeded on 6 January 1842 by Colonel Hamelin Trelawney.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Saint Helena", "response": ["The Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Saint Helena Act in 1833, a provision of which transferred control of St\u00a0Helena from the East India Company to the Crown with effect from 2 April 1834. In practice, the transfer did not take effect until 24 February 1836 when Major-General George Middlemore (1836\u20131842), the first governor appointed by the British government, arrived with 91st Regiment troops. He summarily dismissed St\u00a0Helena Regiment and, following orders from London, embarked on a savage drive to cut administrative costs, dismissing most officers previously in the Company employ. This triggered the start of a long-term pattern whereby those who could afford to do so tended to leave the island for better fortunes and opportunities elsewhere. The population was to fall gradually from 6,150 in 1817 to less than 4,000 by 1890. Charles Darwin spent six days of observation on the island in 1836 during his return journey on HMS Beagle. Controversial figure, Dr. James Barry, also arrived that year as principal medical officer (1836\u20131837). In addition to reorganising the hospital, Barry highlighted the heavy incidence of venereal diseases in the civilian population, blaming the government for the removal of the St\u00a0Helena Regiment, which resulted in destitute females resorting to prostitution."]}, {"page": "76th Regiment of Foot", "response": ["*1843: Lt-Gen.

After a long interview with Joinville (with the rest of the mission waiting impatiently in the lounge), Middlemore appeared before the rest of the mission and announced \"Gentlemen, the Emperor's mortal remains will be handed over to you on Thursday 15 October\". The mission then set off for Longwood, via the Valley of the Tomb (or Geranium Valley).Cp Ben Weider, \"My Pilgrimage to St Helena\". Retrieved 2011-01-02 Napoleon's tomb was in a solitary spot, covered by three slabs placed level with the soil. This very simple monument was surrounded by an iron grille, solidly fixed on a base and shaded by a weeping willow, with another such tree lying dead by its side. All this was surrounded by a wooden fence and very close by was a spring whose fresh and clear water Napoleon had enjoyed. At the gate to the enclosure, Joinville dismounted, bared his head and approached the iron grille, followed by the rest of the mission. In a deep silence they contemplated the severe and bare tomb. After half an hour Joinville remounted and the expedition continued on its way. Lady Torbet, owner of the land where the tomb was sited, had set up a booth to sell refreshments for the few pilgrims to the tomb and was unhappy about the exhumation since it would eliminate her already small profits from it. They then went in pilgrimage to Longwood, which was in a very ruinous state - the furniture had disappeared, many walls were covered with graffiti, Napoleon's bedroom had become a stable where a farmer pastured his beasts and got a little extra income by guiding visitors around it. The sailors from Oreste grabbed the billiard table, which had been spared by the goats and sheep, and carried off the tapestry and anything else they could carry, all the while being loudly shouted at by the farmer with demands for compensation."]}, {"page": "Middlemore, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Middlemore"]}]}}
