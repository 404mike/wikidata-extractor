Bebbington writes that, \"Although 'evangelical', with a lower-case initial, is occasionally used to mean 'of the gospel', the term 'Evangelical', with a capital letter, is applied to any aspect of the movement beginning in the 1730s.\" According to the Oxford English Dictionary, evangelicalism was first used in 1831. In 1812, the term \"evangelicalism\" appeared in \"The History of Lynn\" by William Richards. In the summer of 1811 the term \"evangelicalists\" was used in \"The Sin and Danger of Schism\" by Rev. Dr. Andrew Burnaby, Archdeacon of Leicester."]}, {"page": "King's Lynn", "response": ["Lynn originated on a constricted site south of where the River Great Ouse now discharges into the Wash.
