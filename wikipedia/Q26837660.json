He released 13 players at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. His first summer signing was former two-time Player of the Year Tom Pope on a free transfer after he managed to secure his release from Bury. He went on to sign ten more players during the window: goalkeepers Rob Lainton and Sam Hornby, defenders Joe Davis, Antony Kay, Gavin Gunning, Lawrie Wilson and Graham Kelly, midfielders Michael Tonge, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, David Worrall and Harry Middleton, and striker Tyrone Barnett; he also signed youngsters Rekeil Pyke, Marcus Harness, Tyler Denton, Ben Whitfield, Jack Stobbs and Tom Anderson on loan. However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\". Supporter website OneValeFan described this as \"a somewhat unlikely claim\" as the club had only exited administration in November 2012."]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["Building for the 2018\u201319 season, Aspin released ten players and transfer-listed a further four, whilst bringing in ten new signings and five loan players.

The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch. I fully accept results from December have been poor and expected to be higher up the table and know the players are capable of doing that.\""]}, {"page": "John Askey", "response": ["Askey let 14 players go and signed 14 new players for the 2019\u201320 season, with big names departing including Ben Whitfield, Luke Hannant and Ricky Miller, whilst backup goalkeeper Sam Hornby chose to leave after rejecting a new contract offer.

He was again nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month, with the EFL writing that \"Slow and steady has been Vale's progress under Askey's astute management this season. Their consistency in February - three wins, three draws and 12 goals from six games - finally lifted his side into the play-off positions.\" However the club were one place outside the play-offs when the season was called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England."]}]}}
