The council engaged historian Daniel Williams to research the battle, and in 1974 his findings were used to build the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and the presentation it houses.  Williams's interpretation, however, has since been questioned. Sparked by the battle's quincentenary celebration in 1985, a dispute among historians has led many to suspect the accuracy of Williams's theory.  In particular, geological surveys conducted from 2003 to 2009 by the Battlefields Trust, a charitable organisation that protects and studies old English battlefields, show that the southern and eastern flanks of Ambion Hill were solid ground in the 15th century, contrary to Williams's claim that it was a large area of marshland. Landscape archaeologist Glenn Foard, leader of the survey, said the collected soil samples and finds of medieval military equipment suggest that the battle took place  southwest of Ambion Hill (52\u00b034\u203241\u2033N 1\u00b026\u203202\u2033W), contrary to the popular belief that it was fought near the foot of the hill.; .", "The very extensive survey carried out (2005\u20132009) by the Battlefields Trust headed by Glenn Foard led eventually to the discovery of the real location of the core battlefield.Glenn Foard & Anne Curry (2013).

The work of Leicester University historian Daniel Williams was used to interpret the battle. Numerous historians challenged the Ambion Hill location for the battle and this led to a large-scale project (from 2005 to 2009) by the Battlefields Trust, headed by Glenn Foard, to attempt to definitively find the true location of the battlefield. It is now accepted that the core of the battlefield lies either side of Fenn Lanes, about two miles south-west of the visitor centre and that Ambion Hill was Richard III's camp on the night before the battle.Glenn Foard & Anne Curry, Bosworth 1485: A Battlefield Rediscovered, (Oxford, Oxbow Books, 2013) The battlefield heritage centre now has a viewing point with the Fenn Lane Farm site and other notable points marked.

The most important by far is the silver-gilt boar, which was Richard III\u2019s own badge, given in large numbers to his supporters. But this one is special, because it is silver-gilt. It was almost certainly worn by a knight in King Richard\u2019s own retinue who rode with the King to his death in his last desperate cavalry charge.
