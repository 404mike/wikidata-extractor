She spent twenty years on the stage, the bulk of them with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.\nMusical from an early age, Bond began a concert singing career in Liverpool by 1870.  At the age of 17, she entered into a brief, unhappy marriage.  After leaving her abusive husband, she continued her concert career and studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London with such famous singing teachers as Manuel Garc\u00eda.\nAt the age of 25, in 1878, Bond began her theatrical career, creating the role of Cousin Hebe in Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore, which became an international success.  After this, she created roles of increasing importance with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in a series of successful comic operas, including the title role in Iolanthe (1882), Pitti Sing in The Mikado (1885), Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887), Phoebe in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), Tessa in The Gondoliers (1889) and others.\nDuring the 1890s, she continued performing in the West End for several more years, while being courted by Lewis Ransome, a civil engineer.  In 1897, at the age of 44, Bond married Ransome and left the stage.  They were happily married for 25 years, moving to Nottinghamshire, where Bond lived the life of a country squire's wife.  She also occasionally gave charity concerts and assisted amateur theatre companies.  She survived her husband by twenty years, living to the age of 89.", "link_mentions": {}}}
