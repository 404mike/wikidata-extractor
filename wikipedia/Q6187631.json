She spent twenty years on the stage, the bulk of them with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.\nMusical from an early age, Bond began a concert singing career in Liverpool by 1870.  At the age of 17, she entered into a brief, unhappy marriage.  After leaving her abusive husband, she continued her concert career and studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London with such famous singing teachers as Manuel Garc\u00eda.\nAt the age of 25, in 1878, Bond began her theatrical career, creating the role of Cousin Hebe in Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore, which became an international success.  After this, she created roles of increasing importance with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in a series of successful comic operas, including the title role in Iolanthe (1882), Pitti Sing in The Mikado (1885), Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887), Phoebe in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), Tessa in The Gondoliers (1889) and others.\nDuring the 1890s, she continued performing in the West End for several more years, while being courted by Lewis Ransome, a civil engineer.  In 1897, at the age of 44, Bond married Ransome and left the stage.  They were happily married for 25 years, moving to Nottinghamshire, where Bond lived the life of a country squire's wife.  She also occasionally gave charity concerts and assisted amateur theatre companies.  She survived her husband by twenty years, living to the age of 89.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gilbert and Sullivan", "response": ["Gilbert developed his innovative theories on the art of stage direction, following the playwright and theatrical reformer Tom Robertson.

Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in The Sorcerer transformed into Little Buttercup in Pinafore, then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in Pirates.

Many soubrette roles have a considerable amount of spoken German dialogue, and therefore the soubrette singer must possess both an excellent comprehension of the German language and considerable acting skills. It is rare today to find true soubrettes singing in major opera houses as their voices are typically unable to carry over larger orchestras in larger halls. Often lyric, coloratura, and mezzo-sopranos are cast in soubrette roles, especially in the early part of their singing careers. This does not mean that these singers are soubrette sopranos but it does mean they can play soubrette roles.

As Jessie Bond described in her autobiography:", "No lingering about was allowed, no gossiping with the other actors; the women\u2019s dressing-rooms were on one side of the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases\u00a0\u2013 sheep rigorously separated from the goats! Once, when my mother came to see me in London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.Bond, Jessie. \"The Life and Reminiscences of Jessie Bond\", Chapter 6, John Lane, 1930, accessed 6 June 2010", "Gilbert and Sullivan aficionados frequently use the names of the principal comedians of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company to refer to time periods of the company's history.Wilson and Lloyd, passim Thus, after the sudden death of Sullivan's brother Fred, who had created the role of the Learned Judge in Trial by Jury in 1875, the unknown George Grossmith was recruited in 1877.

Barrie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Ernest Ford's Jane Annie, which was unsuccessful at the Savoy but ran more successfully on tour.  Barrington, a lifelong golf enthusiast, speculated that one reason for the failure of Jane Annie in London was that the game of golf was not yet popular there.Barrington (1908), p. 96 Despite the failure of the piece, Barrington was singled out for critical praise.Walters, p. 19 Barrington next created the role of King Paramount I in Gilbert and Sullivan's Utopia, Limited, opening in October of that year.
