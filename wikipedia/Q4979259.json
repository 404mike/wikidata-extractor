The unit was run by Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, who later stepped down. A series of derivative transactions involving credit default swaps (CDS) were entered, reportedly as part of the bank's \"hedging\" strategy. Trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale, accumulated outsized CDS positions in the market. An estimated trading loss of $2 billion was announced. However, the loss amounted to more than $6 billion for JP Morgan Chase.These events gave rise to a number of investigations to examine the firm's risk management systems and internal controls. JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $920 million in fines. JPMorgan Chase cut chief executive Jamie Dimon's 2012 pay in half, to $11.5 million from $23 million, due to the $6 billion trading loss.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "\u00c9cole Centrale Paris", "response": ["* Bruno Iksil (1991), JPMorgan Chief Investments Trader, a.k.a. the 'London Whale'Article on interview with Bruno Iksil, the 'London Whale'"]}, {"page": "Credit default swap", "response": ["In April 2012, hedge fund insiders became aware that the market in credit default swaps was possibly being affected by the activities of Bruno Iksil, a trader at J.P.

Heavy opposing bets to his positions are known to have been made by traders, including another branch of J.P. Morgan, who purchased the derivatives offered by J.P. Morgan in such high volume. Major losses, $2 billion, were reported by the firm in May 2012 in relationship to these trades.

According to Carl Levin, chairman of this panel, JP Morgan had \"a trading operation that piled on risk, ignored limits on risk taking, hid losses, dodged oversight and misinformed the public\". Dimon dismissed press accounts of possible losses in Iksil's book as a \"tempest in a teapot\" on April 13, 2012 when he knew that Iksil had already lost $1 billion, which led Levin to say \"None of those statements made on April 13 to the public, to investors, to analysts were true,\"  and \"The bank also neglected to disclose on that day that the portfolio had massive positions that were hard to exit, that they were violating in massive numbers key risk limits.\""]}, {"page": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel", "response": ["* Bruno Iksil"]}]}}
