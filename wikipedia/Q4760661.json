Beaumont opened the scoring in less than two minutes, when he headed David Frain's free kick into the Burnley goal.  Ten minutes later, Francis challenged John Keeley just outside the Burnley penalty area: Francis injured his knee ligaments, was shown a yellow card and had to be substituted for Andy Farrell.  In the 14th minute, Ted McMinn won the ball from Stockport's Mick Wallace who reacted: first he fouled McMinn and then spat at him, earning himself a straight red card from Elleray.  McMinn was also booked for retaliation.  In the 29th minute, David Eyres beat three Stockport defenders before striking the ball past Keeley to score his 28th goal of the season, and levelling the score at 1\u20131.  Eyres also hit the frame of the Stockport goal twice as well as seeing another chance defended.", "|12||Andy Farrell "]}]}}
