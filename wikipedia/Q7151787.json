He contributed occasional lead vocals, and played acoustic guitar (6- and 12-string), banjo, harmonica, kazoo and jug. His songs on the first Mungo Jerry album and on the early maxi-singles were generally more folksy and lighter in style than those of group leader Ray Dorset, and he was frustrated when his own songs were constantly rejected for subsequent albums.\nOn the second album, Electronically Tested, his composition \"Black Bubonic Plague\" appeared on European copies only, but not on the British release. In 1972, King recorded a solo album, Been in the Pen Too Long; he left Mungo Jerry shortly afterward.\nHe and the group's keyboard player Colin Earl (born 6 May 1942, Hampton) formed the King Earl Boogie Band with guitarist Dave Lambert, bassist Russell John Brown and washboard player Joe Rush, who had been a part-time Mungo Jerry member. Their album Trouble at Mill, produced by Dave Cousins of Strawbs, was well reviewed, but a single, \"Plastic Jesus\", was banned by the BBC on grounds of blasphemy. The group disbanded a few months later, and Lambert later joined Strawbs.\nKing then pursued a solo career, releasing occasional records under the names P. Rufus King and D\u2019Jurann D\u2019Jurann (no connection with the British group Duran Duran), as well as under his usual name.  \nKing and Earl later formed Skeleton Krew, though in the 1990s they reverted to the name of King Earl Boogie Band.  King retired to Cornwall in 1996, though since then he has occasionally joined his colleagues and former members for one-off gigs, sometimes under the name Skeleton Krew or Skeleton Crew.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jug band", "response": ["The musicians playing in jug music revival groups went on to form other bands. John Sebastian founded the pop music group the Lovin' Spoonful and later continued as a successful solo artist. Country Joe and the Fish came from the Instant Action Jug Band. Mungo Jerry, which evolved from an earlier blues group, Good Earth, was in effect a jug band on their first live performances and recordings, thanks to their use of jug (played by the group's banjo player, Paul King, who left in 1972), and washboard, contributed by regular \"extra member\" Joe Rush. Jesse Colin Young moved to the West Coast and formed the Youngbloods, whose first hit was \"Grizzly Bear,\" a jug band standard. Another group with jug band roots was the Grateful Dead. Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan were in Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions before forming the Warlocks, which evolved into the Grateful Dead. A self-titled CD of Mother McCree's jug band music recorded in 1964 was released in 1999. Maria Muldaur, Geoff Muldaur, David Grisman, and Stefan Grossman all continued with successful solo careers. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band also started as a jug band."]}, {"page": "1948 in music", "response": ["*January 8 \u2013 Paul King, rock musician (Mungo Jerry)"]}, {"page": "Mungo Jerry", "response": ["The trio played more gigs and landed a regular slot at the Master Robert Motel in Osterley, Middlesex, where they soon built up a following, including banjo, guitar and blues harp player Paul King who eventually joined the band, making it a four-piece.", "With time, Dorset found the group's good-time blues and jug band repertoire a little restricting, and in 1972 he released a solo album Cold Blue Excursion, with his songs backed by strings and brass and, in one instance, a jazz band. His intention to broaden the group's appeal by recruiting a drummer led to King and Earl trying to sack him, but the management, regarding Dorset as inseparable in the public eye from Mungo Jerry, fired them both instead. Dorset and Godfrey, the bassist, recruited new members and presented a new sound, heard on the fourth album Boot Power.
