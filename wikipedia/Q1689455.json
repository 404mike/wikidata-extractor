He competed on the Great Britain and Ireland team.Tremeer had no competition in the first round, winning in a walkover.  For the second round, he faced teammate G. Burton, who did not finish the race.  In the final, Tremeer had to contend against two Americans who had taken turns setting new Olympic records in the first two rounds of the event.  Halfway through the race, it became evident that Tremeer had no chance.  He finished third in 57.0 seconds, a time that was still faster than anyone had run the race before the London Olympics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of male hurdlers", "response": ["*Jimmy Tremeer GBR"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metres hurdles", "response": ["The men's 400 metres hurdles was the longer of two hurdling events at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London.
