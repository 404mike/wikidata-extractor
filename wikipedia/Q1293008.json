And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\".

One of the early British music magazines, Melody Maker, complained in 1967 about how \"newspapers and magazines are continually hammering [i.e., attacking] pop music\". From 1964, Melody Maker led its rival publications in terms of approaching music and musicians as a subject for serious study rather than merely entertainment. Staff reporters such as Chris Welch and Ray Coleman applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of rock critics. Among Britain's broadsheet newspapers, pop music gained exposure in the arts section of The Times when William Mann, the paper's classical music critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963. In early 1965, The Observer, the country's highbrow Sunday newspaper, signalled a reversal of the establishment's cultural snobbery towards pop music by appointing George Melly as its \"critic of pop culture\".

Other musicians, including Aretha Franklin, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Isaac Hayes, have identified her singing, guitar playing, and showmanship as an important influence on them. She was held in particularly high esteem by UK jazz/blues singer George Melly. Tina Turner credits Tharpe, along with Mahalia Jackson, as an early musical influence.

He once joked that due to the amount of time spent in underground air-raid shelters people in London were becoming troglodytes, and he took up this word for one of his early jazz bands, Wally Fawkes and the Troglodytes. After the group disbanded Fawkes adopted \"Trog\" as his pen-name. In 1947, he took a weekly course at the Camberwell School of Art in London where fellow students included Humphrey Lyttelton and Francis Wilford-Smith.  Fawkes had been a member of George Webb's Dixielanders, a semi-professional revivalist jazz band that featured Lyttelton on trumpet, since 1944. When Lyttelton left the Dixielanders in January 1948 to form his own jazz band, Fawkes went with him and stayed with the band until 1956, by which time it had evolved from revivalism to mainstream jazz. This suited Fawkes, as his own bands from then on could be broadly described as mainstream.  He re-united with Lyttelton periodically thereafter, and, though highly talented on his instrument, remains (in the best sense of the term) an \"amateur\". He has long admired Sidney Bechet and once recorded with him, as part of Lyttelton's band, in 1949.  He played with George Melly and John Chilton in the Feetwarmers band in the early 1970s.", "In 1949, Fawkes's comic strip Flook first appeared in the Daily Mail.  It featured the unlikely and satirical adventures of its small and furry eponymous hero Fawkes's role on the Mail was chiefly as illustrator, and he had a strong team of collaborators on the scripts for Flook over the years, including George Melly, Barry Norman, Humphrey Lyttelton and Barry Took. Flook ran for 35 years in the Daily Mail until its sudden cancellation in 1984.  Margaret Thatcher once said that it was \"quite the best commentary of the politics of the day\"  Robert Maxwell took Flook to the Daily Mirror, from where it transferred briefly to the Sunday Mirror before being dropped completely.", "Fawkes also produced political cartoons for The Spectator with George Melly as his author. The two also contributed occasionally to Private Eye and, beginning in 1962, the New Statesman. Despite producing larger political cartoons for the Daily Mail, his future role as Illingworth's successor as lead cartoonist was threatened by the paper's preference for the work of Gerald Scarfe. Fawkes therefore began submitting work to other publications, and he began contributing political cartoons to The Observer. At The Observer he fell foul of the readership when some of his cartoons about the British royalty were described as being \"grossly discourteous to the Queen\". In 1967 Scarfe left the Mail and Fawkes' position at the paper became more secure, and in 1968 he stopped writing for The Observer to concentrate on The Daily Mail. In 1967 Fawkes also designed the opening credit sequence for the satirical film Smashing Time, featuring numerous caricatures of its stars Lynn Redgrave and Rita Tushingham."]}, {"page": "Melmoth the Wanderer", "response": ["* A British magazine about surrealism was named Melmoth after the book.

Starring Dench, and Michael Bryant, as the adult children of characters played by Maurice Denham, and Margery Mason, Talking to a Stranger was transmitted as part of BBC2's Theatre 625 anthology series.
