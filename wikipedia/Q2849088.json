It contained very informal 'inside' information from the Citadel Mail Order Department, news, game reviews, articles and competitions as well as a short lived cartoon serial. Some new rules for then current GW products also debuted in Black Sun."]}, {"page": "Warhammer 40,000", "response": ["The second edition of Warhammer 40,000 was published in late 1993. This new course for the game was forged under the direction of editor Andy Chambers.", "Andy Chambers reshaped the lore in way that was more serious and pessimistic in tone (a direction which Rick Priestley lamented). The new theme of the setting is that humanity's situation is not merely dire but hopeless, as the Imperium does not have the strength to defeat its myriad enemies and will collapse in time. This was not the case in the first edition; the first edition rulebook suggested that humanity could eventually triumph and prosper if it can survive long enough to complete its evolution into a fully psychic race, and this was the Emperor's goal."]}, {"page": "Miniature wargaming", "response": ["* Andy Chambers \u2013 Known for his work in rules design and revision for Games Workshop Inc. and Mongoose Publishing.

Following the release of a new trailer for the game, they advised that the long period of silence stemmed from a complete revision of the goals of what they wanted the game to achieve, as a great deal of early speculation drove potential players to think that Necromunda: Underhive Wars nothing more than a reskin of their earlier success with Mordheim: City of the Damned. Additionally, Rogue Factor advised that gameplay would allow players to build a gang of up to five gangers (whereas the tabletop would allow players to have anywhere between 1-15, depending on the gang they were using), and featured a new campaign written by Games Workshop Alumni Andy Chambers. In mid-June, Steam advised that they had begun taking preorders for Underhive Wars with a release date of 8 September 2020. Upon the game's release, players will be able to choose from the Goliath, Escher, and Orlock gangs, and the five-character gang limitation per player has been confirmed."]}, {"page": "Ropecon", "response": ["| 1996 || Paasitorni || Tom Dowd and Andy Chambers"]}]}}
