Created by horror filmmaker Adam Green (Hatchet, Frozen), the series starred Dave Brockie in his \"Oderus Urungus\" character as series lead Adam Green's imaginary alien friend and guardian angel who lives in his closet. In each episode, whenever \"Adam\" faced a personal problem, \"Oderus\" would come out of his closet and dish out advice that was both hilariously and terribly misguided, oftentimes causing \"Adam\" to have even worse problems.

A third season of Holliston was being scripted by Green when Brockie died in March 2014. When asked in recent interviews about how he would address the loss of Brockie and whether or not Holliston would indeed continue, Green stated, \"I am too heartbroken over the loss of my friend and brother to think about that right now.\" Green says he will be focusing on his other upcoming film projects until he is emotionally ready to turn his attention back to his TV series and that \"it will take me however long it may take me.\" A 25-year-long fan of Gwar and one of Brockie's closest friends, Green took Brockie's death extremely hard.
