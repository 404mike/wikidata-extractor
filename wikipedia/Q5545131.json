The NVR seems to have had some, perhaps informal, oversight from the King's African Rifles (KAR), the African-manned regular army regiment of British East Africa.  In 1911 the KAR's inspector-general, Colonel George Thesiger, recommended that the NVR received military training and practice drills, but this was not implemented.  However, the NVR was placed on a more military-style footing from 1913 when, on 24 July, former KAR officer Captain C. W. Barton was appointed adjutant and intelligence officer and, on 28 August, the post of organising secretary was abolished.  One of Barton's first actions was to attempt to form a sixth section at Magomero, where A. L. Bruce Estates had donated land for a shooting range, but he was unable to find the ten recruits necessary.  He succeeded in raising a section at Mlanje on 16 February 1914."]}]}}
