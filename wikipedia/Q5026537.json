The philosophy of the charity was based on her belief that children's behaviour is biologically determined and environmentally influenced. According to Batmanghelidjh, environmental factors can, ultimately, influence how children develop into adulthood through a type of re-wiring of the brain (neuroplasticity), for more positive outcomes in encouraging and caring environments. Writing in The Guardian, Peter Beresford, professor of social policy at Brunel University, suggested that Batmanghelidjh's belief that \"parenting at an early age hard-wires children\u2019s brains for success or failure, deviance or conformity\" was \"pseudoscience\".
