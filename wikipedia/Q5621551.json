He opened a bicycle factory in Bexhill-on-Sea, and in 1905 he built his first lightweight, water-cooled aircraft engine. He established the Green Engine Co. to produce them. Early Green engines were used by pioneers of British aviation like Alliott Verdon Roe and Samuel Cody, but his later engines were too heavy for the aircraft of the time. They were used to power torpedo boats during World War I.\nIn 1909, Green was awarded a \u00a31,000 prize by the British government for his work on aero engines, and he was awarded another prize of \u00a35,000 in 1914.After World War II, Green became involved in the development of the 'flexible deck' concept for aircraft carriers. His ideas for such a deck culminated in the successful landing of a de Havilland Sea Vampire, flown by Eric \"Winkle\" Brown, on an experimental rubber deck installed on HMS Warrior.\nGreen became an honorary companion of the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1958. He died in December 1964, at his home in Twickenham, only a few months before what would have been his 100th birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Green Engine Co", "response": ["The Green Engine Co was a British engine company founded by Gustavus Green in Bexhill to sell engines of his design.
