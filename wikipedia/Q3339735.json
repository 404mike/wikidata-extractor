By this time, Drake had discovered the British and American folk music scenes, and was influenced by performers such as Bob Dylan, Donovan, Van Morrison, Josh White and Phil Ochs. He began performing in local clubs and coffee houses around London, and in February 1968, while playing support to Country Joe and the Fish at the Roundhouse in Camden Town, made an impression on Ashley Hutchings, bass player with Fairport Convention.\"Nick Drake\u2014Chronology\".

A month later, on 24 September, he opened for Fairport Convention at the Royal Festival Hall in London, followed by appearances at folk clubs in Birmingham and Hull. Folk singer Michael Chapman said of the performances:The folkies did not take to him; [they] wanted songs with choruses. They completely missed the point. He didn't say a word the entire evening. It was actually quite painful to watch. I don't know what the audience expected, I mean, they must have known they weren't going to get sea-shanties and sing-alongs at a Nick Drake gig!", "The experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.Sandall, Robert. \"Brighter Very Much Later\", The Daily Telegraph, 20 May 2004; retrieved 31 December 2021.

Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \"Northern Sky\" and \"Fly\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \"Northern Sky\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential.Dann (2006), p. 242.

Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\"Macaulay, Stephen. \"Nick Drake\u2014Bartleby the Musician\", gloriousnoise.com; accessed 1 November 2016.

He had tried to stay in touch with Sophia Ryde, whom he had met in London in 1968.Dann (2006), pp. 54, 183. Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as \"the nearest thing\" to a girlfriend in his life, but she used the description \"best (girl) friend\".Dann (2006), p. 55.

Fans used the filesharing software Napster to circulate digital copies of Drake's music; according to the Atlantic, \"The chronic shyness and mental illness that made it hard for Drake to compete with 1970s showmen like Elton John and David Bowie didn't matter when his songs were being pulled one by one out of the ether and played late at night in a dorm room.\" In November 2014, his sister Gabrielle published a biography of Drake.Drake, G. and Callomon, C.

It was the only one of Drake's studio albums to be released in North America during his lifetime: the only previous release there had been a 1971 compilation simply entitled Nick Drake featuring tracks from both his first two albums, which were not released in North America in their original forms until 1976. Pink Moon differs from Drake's previous albums in that it was recorded without a backing band, featuring just Drake on vocals, acoustic guitar and a brief piano riff overdubbed onto the title track.", "Nick Drake's first two albums with Island Records, Five Leaves Left (1969) and Bryter Layter (1971), had sold poorly, and combined with Drake's reluctance to perform live or engage in album promotion, Island was not confident of another album from Drake. Additionally, Drake had isolated himself in his London apartment and was suffering from depression. In 1971 he saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed antidepressants, which he was reluctant to take due to the stigma associated with depression and his fears concerning the medication's interaction with marijuana, which he smoked regularly.  Although critics often associate Drake's music, and especially the perceived melancholy of Pink Moon, with his depression, Cally Calloman of Bryter Music, which manages Drake's estate, remembers it differently: \"Nick was incapable of writing and recording while he was suffering from periods of depression. He was not depressed during the writing or recording of Pink Moon and was immensely proud of the album.\"", "Contrary to popular legend that Drake dropped the album off in a plastic bag at Island Records' reception and then left without anyone realising, Drake delivered the master tapes of Pink Moon to Chris Blackwell at Island. In an interview for the Nick Drake fanzine Pynk Moon in 1996, Island's press officer David Sandison recalled that Drake's arrival at the record company had certainly not gone unnoticed, although there had been no indication that he was delivering them a new album:", "The tapes of the Pink Moon session also included Drake's recording of \"Plaisir d'amour\" (translated from French as \"The Pleasure of Love\"), a classical French love song written in 1784 by Jean-Paul-\u00c9gide Martini. Although \"Plaisir d'amour\" was on the track listing of the Pink Moon master tape box as the first track of Side Two, when the tapes were presented they included a note in reference to the song which read, \"Spare title \u2013 Do not use\", so the song didn't make it onto the album. The recording was less than a minute long, featured guitar with no vocals, and was eventually included as a hidden track on UK editions of the Nick Drake compilation A Treasury (2004). Had \"Plaisir d'amour\" been included on the Pink Moon album, it would have been the only song on any of his albums that Nick Drake did not write himself.", "Pink Moon received more attention from the UK music press than Drake's first two albums had, but most critical reviews were still brief. Jerry Gilbert of Sounds, who had conducted the only known interview with Drake the previous year and who had been his biggest champion up to this point, expressed his disappointment with the album and his frustration at Drake's apparent lack of motivation, saying, \"The album consists entirely of Nick's guitar, voice and piano and features all the usual characteristics without ever matching up to Bryter Layter. One has to accept that Nick's songs necessarily require further augmentation, for whilst his own accompaniments are good the songs are not sufficiently strong to stand up without any embroidery at all. 'Things Behind the Sun' makes it, so does 'Parasite' \u2013 but maybe it's time Mr. Drake stopped acting so mysteriously and started getting something properly organised for himself.\" In Melody Maker Mark Plummer appreciated the music, but was distracted by Drake's growing ascetic mythology: \"His music is so personal and shyly presented both lyrically and in his confined guitar and piano playing that neither does nor doesn't come over\u00a0... The more you listen to Drake though, the more compelling his music becomes \u2013 but all the time it hides from you. On 'Things Behind the Sun', he sings to me, embarrassed and shy. Perhaps one should play his albums with the sound off and just look at the cover and make the music in your head reciting his words from inside the cover to your own rhythmic heart rhymes\u00a0... It could be that Nick Drake does not exist at all.\"", "Referring to Drake's recorded output, Fred Dellar noted in Hi-Fi News & Record Review that \"the LPs hardly sell, thanks partly to Nick's reluctance to play promotional concerts and one is left with the feeling that his only ambition is to play the lead in the Howard Hughes story should anyone ever decide to make it as a musical. In the meantime, he employs his deliciously smokey voice in making these intimate, late-night sounds that I find myself playing time and time again.\" In the London edition of Time Out Al Clark observed that Drake \"writes striking and evocative songs and always has done, but most of the magic is in the delivery: a smoky, palpitating voice, reminiscent of the jazzier Donovan, gliding wistful words over the chord changes and creating moments of perfect stillness\". Clark stated that \"several of the more substantial songs are very lovely\", but concluded presciently, \"Sadly, and despite Island's efforts to rectify the situation, Nick Drake is likely to remain in the shadows, the private troubadour of those who have been fortunate enough to catch an earful of his exquisite 3am introversions\".", "By the time of the album's reissues on compact disc in the 1990s and 2000s, Drake's fame and critical standing had improved considerably, and legacy reviews of the album were overwhelmingly favourable. Martin Aston of Q noted in 1990 that \"the mood is even more remote [than Drake's first two albums] with \u2013 finally \u2013 a defeated strain in both throat and words, but several of his most elegant melodies\". John Harris's review of the 2000 reissue in the same magazine was more positive still, claiming that \"many hold up Pink Moon as Nick Drake's best album\" and saying, \"The motivation of success had evaporated and Drake made a record so singular and uncompromising that, superficially, it beggars belief\u00a0... The truth is that Pink Moons excellence shines through, irrespective of the endless speculation [regarding Drake's state of mind during the making of the record and subsequent death]. Few records have ever sounded so intimate, or embodied the eternal human ailment known as Melancholy with such grace and assurance.\" In Mojo Rob Chapman claimed that \"Pink Moon is his masterpiece and the Robert Johnson comparisons are fully deserved\". Critic and author Ian MacDonald, a contemporary of Drake's at Cambridge University, stated in Uncut that \"what remains clear is that this is one of the premium singer-songwriter albums, nearly every one of its 11 tracks a timeless classic\".", "Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis observed that \"by the time of these sessions, Drake had retreated so deeply into his own internal world that it is difficult to say what the songs are 'about'. His lyrics are so compressed as to be kind of folkloric haikus, almost childishly simple in their structure and elemental in their imagery. His voice conveys, in its moans and breathy whispers, an alluring sensuality, but he sings as if he were viewing his life from a great, unbridgeable distance. That element of detachment is chilling. To reinforce it, messages of isolation gradually float to the surface of the songs' spare, eloquent melodies.\" Three years later in the same magazine James Hunter said of the 2003 North American reissue, \"The album unleashes a dramatic starkness and some breathtakingly pretty music\". AllMusic's Ned Raggett wrote in his retrospective review that \"Pink Moon more than anything else is the record that made Drake the cult figure he remains. Specifically, Pink Moon is the bleakest of [all his records]; that the likes of Belle and Sebastian are fans of Drake may be clear enough, but it's doubtful they could ever achieve the calm, focused anguish of this album, as harrowing as it is attractive ... Drake's elegant melancholia avoiding sounding pretentious in the least thanks to his continued embrace of simple, tender vocalizing. Meanwhile, the sheer majesty of his guitar playing \u2013 consider the opening notes of 'Road' or 'Parasite' \u2013 makes for a breathless wonder to behold.\" Reviewing Pink Moon as part of the 2014 box set Tuck Box, Jayson Greene of Pitchfork noted, \"A 'pink moon' is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity ... On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. Drake's voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It's almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in Pink Moon, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It's only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of Drake's vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies ... There is a stillness to Nick Drake's music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and Pink Moon is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.\"", "The first notable cover versions of Nick Drake songs were released in 1992, when Lucinda Williams covered \"Which Will\" on her album Sweet Old World, and alternative rock band Sebadoh covered \"Pink Moon\" on their EP Sebadoh vs Helmet. By 2006, Beck recorded covers of the album's songs for online-only release, including \"Which Will\", and \"Parasite\".", "On 11 November 1999 Volkswagen debuted a television advertising campaign, named \"Milky Way\", which featured the Volkswagen Cabriolet with the title track of Pink Moon as the soundtrack.
