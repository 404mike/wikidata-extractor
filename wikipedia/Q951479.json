In 1876, Greenhill was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy (RMA) at Woolwich, London, UK. He held this chair until his retirement in 1908. His 1892 textbook on applications of elliptic functions is of acknowledged excellence. He was one of the world's leading experts on applications of elliptic integrals in electromagnetic theory. He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1904 at Heidelberg (where he also gave a section talk) and an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1908 at Rome, in 1920 at Strasbourg, and in 1924 at Toronto.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rounding", "response": ["A wavy equals sign (\u2248: approximately equal to) is sometimes used to indicate rounding of exact numbers, e.g., 9.98 \u2248 10.
