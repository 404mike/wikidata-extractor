It continued until series 7 but was not used for series 8 and 9; it was then reinstated in series 10 and has remained a feature of the show ever since. There are two couples in each dance-off: the two who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges' scores and public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week's competition. Before they attempt their dance a second time, the couple sometimes gets advice from the judges. The judges decide who continues in the competition and who is eliminated based on the dance-off performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be saved, that couple is through to the following week's competition and the Head Judge's vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the Head Judge, originally Len Goodman and currently Shirley Ballas. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance \u2014 sometimes known as \"waltzing out of the ballroom\". The Monday after their elimination, they appear on It Takes Two to discuss their time on the programme. The dance-off has been cancelled only once, in series 14, due to an injury sustained earlier by one of the celebrity contestants, Anastacia. She was unable to perform the dance-off and the couple with the lowest combined total was eliminated.", "On 4 May 2017, it was announced that series 7 finalist Natalie Lowe would be departing the show.
