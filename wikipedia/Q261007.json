Illustration is a more direct unification of these media and, like subject painting, can assert a narrative of its own. For the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti specifically, there was anxiety about the constraints of illustration. In 1855, Rossetti wrote to William Allingham about the independence of illustration: \u201cI have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the \u2018Vision of Sin\u2019 and \u2018Palace of Art\u2019 etc. \u2013 those where one can allegorize on one's own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet's.\" This passage makes apparent Rossetti's desire to not just support the poet's narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well.
