He was controversially left out of the British team for the 2012 Olympic Games in London despite being the world no. 1-ranked competitor in the \u221280\u00a0kg division when the British Taekwondo Control Board selected Lutalo Muhammad (who was ranked world no. 59 in \u221280\u00a0kg and world no. 7 in \u221287\u00a0kg). Following this, Cook indicated he could no longer work with the governing authorities in Great Britain, and switched allegiance to the Isle of Man. This move to a non-Olympic nation ostensibly allowed Cook to achieve qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics for Great Britain, the country for which Isle of Man athletes participate at the Olympics.", "The British Taekwondo Control Board selected Lutalo Muhammad as their competitor in the \u221280\u00a0kg instead of Cook for the olympics. Muhammad was the European champion in the non-Olympic \u221287\u00a0kg category, and was ranked the world no. 7 in the \u221287\u00a0kg division and the world no. 59 in the \u221280\u00a0kg division. Cook had won two of the three competitive bouts between himself and Muhammad and had considerably more international competitive experience. His omission was controversial and he considered legal action to overturn the decision, his agent saying: \"If the British world number one and reigning European Champion does not compete, it will be a national disgrace. This is an embarrassment not only for the sport of taekwondo internationally, but also for Great Britain's international reputation in hosting the London 2012 Games.\" Many in the British sporting community and the press voiced concerns that Cook had been deliberately overlooked due to his decision to leave the British Taekwondo training programme as this had left the national association feeling slighted by Cook. However, Team GB Taekwondo performance director Gary Hall commented on the controversy by saying: \"In some ways, Aaron has a bigger marketing machine than the whole of GB Taekwondo.\" Women's world champion Sarah Stevenson defended the selection, saying that: \"To be world number one on a rankings system is not what taekwondo is, it doesn't mean you're the best in the world. I don't even care or know what ranking I am, and people need to realise this. It's really unfair that GB Taekwondo are getting criticised for not picking a world number one.\" The British Olympic Association (BOA) initially refused to ratify Muhammad's selection, but eventually endorsed the decision after a second selection committee meeting, held with a BOA observer present, led to a confirmation of Muhammad's selection."]}, {"page": "Celebrity Mastermind", "response": ["| Lutalo Muhammad || Jack Johnson || 4th"]}, {"page": "List of Strictly Come Dancing specials", "response": ["On 18 November 2016, British Olympians Canoeist Joe Clarke, Hockey player Hollie Webb, Taekwando athlete, Lutalo Muhammad and Rower Helen Glover competed in the 2016 Children in Need Special.
