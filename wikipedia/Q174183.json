In 1975 she moved to Florence in Italy with her son, Liam, even though she didn't speak Italian. There, she continued to work on pottery in Montelupo, a pottery town near Florence, and began writing. It was in Montelupo that she met the model for \"Marshal Guarnaccia\". Her first book, Death of an Englishman, was first published in 1981. All her stories take place in Florence, which she describes as a \"very secret city\". She lived near enough to the Carabinieri station at Pitti to stroll there regularly and have a chat with the marshal, who kept her up to date on crime in the city. She was admired by and became friends with the writer Georges Simenon. \nShe also wrote the Josie Smith books for children and did occasional journalistic pieces for English, German and Italian papers. In 1991 she won the Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize for Josie Smith and Eileen, the second book in the series. \nHer final novel, Vita Nuova in the Marshal Guarnaccia series, was posthumously published in 2008.\nShe died in Florence of a stroke, aged 60.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 18", "response": ["*  2007   \u2013 Magdalen Nabb, English author (b. 1947)"]}, {"page": "List of crime writers", "response": ["*Magdalen Nabb (1947\u20132007, E)"]}, {"page": "Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize", "response": ["* 6 \u2013 8 years: Josie Smith and Eileen by Magdalen Nabb (Collins)"]}, {"page": "Magdalen naab", "response": ["#REDIRECT Magdalen Nabb"]}, {"page": "1947 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Magdalen Nabb, author (died 2007)"]}, {"page": "2007 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Magdalen Nabb, author (born 1947)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2007", "response": ["*Magdalen Nabb, 60, British author, stroke."]}, {"page": "Irina", "response": ["*Irina, the child protagonist in Magdalen Nabb's The Enchanted Horse."]}, {"page": "The Monster of Florence: A True Story", "response": ["*Magdalen Nabb"]}, {"page": "Timothy Williams (author)", "response": ["Williams is among the small number of authors writing Italian crime novels in English (including Magdalen Nabb, Michael Dibdin, and Donna Leon), three of whom are British and were born in the span of a single year.Ms Leon was born in 1942.Ms Nabb and Mr Dibdin both died in 2007.
