Son of Frankenstein was a reaction to the popular re-releases of Dracula and Frankenstein as double-features in 1938. In the film, one of the sons of Frankenstein finds his father's monster in a coma and revives him, only to find out he is controlled by Ygor who is bent on revenge.

Film historian Gregory William Mank said Lugosi was just completing work in Genius at Work (1946) and would have had time to join the cast; he apparently received no offer for the role. Dracula was being portrayed again by Carradine as he had in House of Frankenstein. Carradine spoke about playing Dracula in 1986 saying, \"I pity anyone who plays the part\", adding \"The role holds a curse greater than Hamlet! Give the audience Richard III, Othello, The Merchant of Venice and what will they remember? A Vampyer!\" Carradine said his portrayal of Dracula was to be \"as evil as possible for I learned long ago that if I wanted to continue to eat, villains find steadier work than artists\". Carradine commented the script made Dracula into \"a type of dope fiend. Instead of existing as the traditional vampire, he now was seeking out the help of a doctor to cure him of his vampirism by the use of medical means\", adding \"he knows he is doing something wrong, and yet he cannot stop himself. In Stoker's day it was more sexual regression than drugs.\" On getting an actor for the role of the Monster, Malvern noted \"Lon was the Wolf Man, Lugosi was making pictures over at Monogram and Karloff wouldn't have played the monster again if it meant a million dollars.\" Glenn Strange portrayed the role of Frankenstein's monster as he had done in House of Frankenstein.
