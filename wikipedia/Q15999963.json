He played for Cambridge University, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and Nottinghamshire between 1888 and 1896. He was born at Arnold, Nottinghamshire and died at Worksop, also in Nottinghamshire. He was known during his lifetime as \"Sandford Robinson\" as his father was called \"John Robinson\".Robinson's father founded the successful Home Brewery in Daybrook, Arnold in 1875, later acquired Worksop Manor and was knighted in 1905; Sandford Robinson was sent to Harrow School and then he went to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper, but neither at school nor at university did he make much impression: at Harrow he did not play in the grand set-piece cricket matches against the other major public schools, though he did appear in a 12-a-side match with the MCC in 1886. At Cambridge, he played in two trial games but was given only one chance in the first team: a match against the Gentlemen of England in which he opened the batting, scored 7 and 1, and took a catch in each innings. He did no better in a game for Nottinghamshire later in that season and in single matches in both 1889 and 1890 against Cambridge University \u2013 playing for an opposing team was a frequent ploy used by Cambridge when they wanted to try a cricketer out, but in Robinson's case it led to no further first-team appearances.Robinson graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1890. In 1891 and 1892, he played first-class cricket fairly regularly for Nottinghamshire, captaining the team on occasion, and for some amateur teams, though only in 1892 did he have any success: his two first-class scores of more than 50 both came in this season. His best innings was a score of 72 in the Nottinghamshire game against Middlesex when he put on 161 for the fifth wicket with Arthur Shrewsbury, who made 212. At the end of the 1892 English cricket season he joined Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1892\u201393, where he played in a single first-class match; he did not then appear at all in first-class cricket in 1893. He reappeared in Nottinghamshire matches in 1894 and occasionally kept wicket that season, and at the end of it he went on a second tour, this time with Lord Hawke to North America, where he played in two first-class cricket matches. He played occasionally in both 1895 and 1896 with no success.\nRobinson had other interests outside cricket, though he appears not to have had a career or profession. He was a captain in the Robin Hood Rifles, a volunteer army unit raised in Nottinghamshire and he also played football for Worksop Town F. C.. He was also engaged in field sports and a fall from his horse while hunting two weeks before he died was thought to have accelerated his death, which was unexpected.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*John Robinson (1868\u20131898), English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1892\u201393", "response": ["* John Robinson"]}, {"page": "East of England cricket team", "response": ["* John Robinson (1894)"]}, {"page": "John Robinson", "response": ["John Robinson may refer to:", "* John Robinson (Australian statistician), professor at Sydney University and 2008 recipient of the Statistical Society of Australia Pitman Medal", "*John Robinson (organist) (1682\u20131762), English organist", "*John Robinson (English actor) (1908\u20131979), British actor, known for Quatermass II", "*John Robinson (sculptor) (1935\u20132007), British sculptor", "*John Robinson (drummer) (born 1954), American drummer and session musician", "*John Robinson (church musician) (born 1983), organist and choir director", "*John Robinson (American actor) (born 1985), American actor", "*John Robinson (Canadian actor), Canadian actor", "*Jon-John Robinson (born 1970), American record producer and songwriter", "*John Robinson (1843\u20131921), owner of the John Robinson Circus", "*John Robinson (militiaman) (1735\u20131805), American Revolutionary War militia officer", "*John Robinson (Medal of Honor) (1840\u2013?), U.S. Navy sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Robinson (aviator) (1905\u20131954), American aviator and activist", "*John Robinson (businessman) (1782\u20131828), merchant and political figure in New Brunswick", "*Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto (1791\u20131863), lawyer, judge and political figure in Upper Canada, kinsman of John Robinson (1650\u20131723)", "*Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of London (1615\u20131680), Lord Mayor of London, MP for the City of London, Middlesex and Rye", "*John Robinson (Liskeard MP) (1620\u2013?), English politician in House of Commons in 1660", "*John Robinson (Harwich MP) (1727\u20131802), British Member of Parliament for Harwich, 1774\u20131803", "*John Robinson (New York politician) (1654\u20131734), Member of the New York General Assembly of 1691", "*John Robinson (Virginia politician) (1705\u20131766), Speaker of the House of Burgesses in Virginia ", "*John Robinson (Virginian) (1822\u20131900), African American state Senator in Virginia", "*John Robinson (judge) (1880\u20131951), Chief Justice of the Washington Supreme Court", "*John Robinson (Maine politician) (born 1972), served in the Maine House of Representatives", "*John Robinson (agriculture commissioner), North Carolina politician", "*John Robinson (US Marshal) (1838\u20131917), sheriff of Bennington County, Vermont and US Marshal for the District of Vermont", "*John Robinson (pastor) (1576\u20131625), English pastor who organized the Mayflower voyage", "*John Robinson (bishop of London) (1650\u20131723), English diplomat, Bishop of Bristol, Lord Privy Seal etc.", "*John Robinson (historian) (1774\u20131840), English cleric", "*John Robinson (priest) (1852\u20131916), Dean of Belfast", "*John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich) (John Arthur Thomas Robinson, 1919\u20131983), British Bishop of Woolwich", "*John Robinson (Archdeacon of Bedford) (died 1598), English priest and academic", "*John Robinson (1868\u20131898), English cricketer", "*John Robinson (sportsman) (1872\u20131959), English cricketer and rugby union footballer", "*John Robinson (1891\u20131966), Australian rules footballer", "*John Robinson (1909\u20131988), English cricketer", "*John Robinson (born 1935), American football coach", "*John Robinson (born 1971), Welsh footballer", "* John Robinson (17th century), associate of William Shakespeare", "* John Robinson (merchant), British merchant in the 19th century", "* John Robinson (engineer) (1823\u20131902), British locomotive engineer", "* John Robinson (Natal politician) (1839\u20131903), prime minister of Colony of Natal", "* John Robinson (brewer) (1895\u20131978), British brewing executive and local politician", "* John Robinson (architect), architect of the Isle of Man who designed two Registered Buildings", "* John Robinson (architect, born 1829), designer of St Lawrence and Mary Magdalene Drinking Fountain, London"]}, {"page": "Sandford Robinson", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Robinson (cricketer, born 1868)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* John Robinson (1889\u20131896) : J.
