Around the age of 23, Dalton may have considered studying law or medicine, but his relatives did not encourage him, perhaps because being a Dissenter, he was barred from attending English universities. He acquired much scientific knowledge from informal instruction by John Gough, a blind philosopher who was gifted in the sciences and arts. At 27, he was appointed teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy at the \"Manchester Academy\" in Manchester, a dissenting academy (the lineal predecessor, following a number of changes of location, of Harris Manchester College, Oxford). He remained for seven years when the college's worsening financial situation led to his resignation. Dalton began a new career as a private tutor in the same two subjects."]}, {"page": "Local Heroes (British TV series)", "response": ["#*\t\tJohn Gough (natural philosopher): blind naturalist who could identify any plant by taste and touch"]}, {"page": "1825 in science", "response": ["* July 25 \u2013 John Gough (born 1757), blind English natural philosopher."]}, {"page": "1757 in science", "response": ["* January 17 \u2013 John Gough, English natural philosopher (died 1825)"]}, {"page": "Gough", "response": ["*John Gough (1871\u20131915), British general and recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*John Gough (1757\u20131825), blind English natural and experimental philosopher"]}, {"page": "John Gough (British Army officer)", "response": ["thumb|John Gough, second from right, talking to Brigadier-General E M Percival.

Its most useful application was its ability to erase pencil marks on paper by rubbing, hence its name. One of its most peculiar properties is a slight (but detectable) increase in temperature that occurs when a sample of rubber is stretched. If it is allowed to quickly retract, an equal amount of cooling is observed. This phenomenon caught the attention of the English physicist John Gough. In 1805 he published some qualitative observations on this characteristic as well as how the required stretching force increased with temperature.Proc. Lit. and Phil. Soc., Manchester, 2d ser., 1, 288 (1805)"]}, {"page": "Gough\u2013Joule effect", "response": ["If an elastic band is first stretched and then subjected to heating, it will shrink rather than expand.

He had at least three younger brothers. He was educated at the school of the blind Quaker mathematician John Gough at Kendal and proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a sizar in 1813. He was made a scholar in 1816 and graduated BA as fourth wrangler in 1817, proceeding M.A. in 1820. From 1818 to 1836 Dawes was mathematical tutor, fellow, and bursar of the newly founded Downing College, Cambridge. He was ordained in 1818 and also held the college living of Tadlow, Cambridgeshire, from 1820 to 1840. At this time Dawes was strongly influenced by the contemporary circle of notable Cambridge scientists, including William Whewell, John Stevens Henslow, and Adam Sedgwick. In 1836 he married Mary Helen, daughter of Alexander Gordon, Esq. of Logie, Aberdeenshire and step-daughter of George James Guthrie, Esq.  In 1837 Sir John Mill, his former pupil at Downing, presented him to the rectory of Kings Somborne, Hampshire, where he built a school and developed his ideas on educating the poor. In 1850 he was appointed Dean of Hereford and died of paralysis at the deanery, Hereford, on 10 March 1867, and was buried in the Ladye Arbour of the cathedral.
