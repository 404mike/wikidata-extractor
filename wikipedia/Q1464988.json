It is the first and only theatrical live-action/animated Thomas & Friends film in the franchise. The film stars Alec Baldwin as Mr. Conductor, Peter Fonda, Mara Wilson, Didi Conn, Russell Means, Cody McMains, Michael E. Rodgers, and the voices of Eddie Glen and Neil Crone. The film is based on the British children's book series The Railway Series by the Reverend W. Awdry, its televised adaptation Thomas & Friends by Allcroft, and the American television series Shining Time Station by Allcroft and Rick Siggelkow. The film tells the story of Lily Stone (Wilson), the granddaughter of the caretaker (Fonda) of an enchanted steam engine who is lacking an appropriate supply of coal, and Mr. Conductor (Baldwin) of Shining Time Station, whose provisions of magical gold dust are at a critical low. To ameliorate these problems, Lily and Mr. Conductor enlist the help of Thomas the Tank Engine (Glen), who confronts the ruthless, steam engine-hating Diesel 10 (Crone) along the way.", "* Michael E.

But it must not become this way with Larsa. You must ensure that it does not. / Gabranth: So then, you ask me to be his sword, to strike where he might not? / Gramis: Rather be his shield. Gabranth, keep your close watch on Vayne. His is the keenest blade of all.  Gabranth loathes himself for the framing of his brother and the horrible tasks Vayne and the Empire have commanded him to do, such as killing Drace to prove his loyalty to Vayne after his rise to power.Drace: Live, Gabranth. Protect the young lord. Protect Larsa... / Gabranth: Forgive me. / Drace: Pray be quick. Gabranth: Have you your fill of this? / Basch: I would ask you the same. Let this end, Noah. / Gabranth: I\u2019ve no right to be called by that name. / Basch: Then live. And reclaim it.  He accompanies Bergan and Zargabaath to Mt. Bur-Omisace where Larsa agrees to return with him, to avoid any trouble. Gabranth later was sent to Pharos to \"test\" Ashe if she would take revenge, attacking the group in rage when they refused to exact vengeance for the wrongs against them as he had; he leaves after his defeat and the arrival of Cid. At the end of the game, after a discussion and fight with Basch, Gabranth decides to make up for his wrongs by protecting Larsa and helping the Resistance kill Vayne. He is fatally injured by Vayne in the process. He dies after the battle, requesting that Basch replace him as the protector of the new Emperor Larsa. Basch agrees, and is later shown serving as \"Gabranth\" and Larsa's protector. Gabranth is one of the villains and the sole character representing Final Fantasy XII in Dissidia: Final Fantasy, where, as in Final Fantasy XII, he is voiced by Akio \u014ctsuka in the Japanese version; in the English version of XII he was voiced by Michael E. Rodgers, but in Dissidia he is instead voiced by Keith Ferguson, the voice for his twin brother Basch in XII.

The distinctive limestone station building was completely encased in wooden cladding and finished in a brown and cream colour scheme for the duration. Between the filming the production company provided their own style station nameboards which were erected between shots for the convenience of passengers, the railway remaining operational throughout the period of filming. The goods shed was disguised as the local Cooperative Store and period cars and set dressings were featured in the station. Some of the scenes shot featuring Alec Baldwin (the 1st station master), Michael E. Rodgers (the 2nd station master) and Peter Fonda (the grandfather) were shot at this location. The railway was used extensively during filming, with Port St. Mary goods shed being transformed into a workshop for the purpose and other island locations were also used including the Tynwald Hill Inn at St. John's. The locomotives and carriages were however not featured in the finished motion picture."]}, {"page": "Sinner (film)", "response": ["Sinner is a 2007 drama film directed by Marc Benardout and starring Nick Chinlund, Georgina Cates, Michael E.
