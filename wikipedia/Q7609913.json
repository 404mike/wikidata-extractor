Through his calculations he predicted an 1869 storm called the Saxby Gale. Saxby also published a book in 1864 called the Saxby Weather system that taught his methods of Astrological Meteorology.  He also distributed lists of days when atmospheric disturbances would occur that were given to sailors of that era so they could anticipate approaching storms.  Saxby's Astrological Meteorological methods have inspired others who predict weather using astrology including Ken Ring of New Zealand.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert FitzRoy", "response": ["FitzRoy debunked Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby's lunar weather forecasting method as pseudoscience.

The storm was named for Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby, a naval instructor who, based on his astronomical studies, had predicted extremely high tides in the North Atlantic Ocean on October 1, 1869, which would produce storm surges in the event of a storm.", "The storm (which pre-dated the practice of naming hurricanes) was given the name \"Saxby\" in honor of Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby, Royal Navy, who was a naval instructor and amateur astronomer.  Lt. Saxby had written a letter of warning, published December 25, 1868, in London's The Standard newspaper in which he notes the astronomical forces predicted for October 5, 1869, which would produce extremely high tides in the North Atlantic Ocean during the height of hurricane season.  Lt. Saxby followed this warning with a reminder published on September 16, 1869, to The Standard in which he also warns of a major \"atmospheric disturbance\" that would coincide with the high water level at an undetermined location.  Many newspapers took up Saxby's warning in the coming days."]}, {"page": "Henry Saxby", "response": ["Saxby was born in London and his father, Stephen Martin Saxby, was of some renown himself, as a naval architect, inventor and weather forecaster. Henry Saxby first visited Shetland in 1854, assisting his elder brother, Stephen Henry Saxby (1831-1886) to collect bird specimens. In 1858, Henry Saxby returned to Shetland to Unst and in 1859 he married Jessie Edmondston, youngest daughter of Laurence Edmondston. To many Shetlanders, Jessie Margaret Edmondston Saxby, a prolific author, is the better known of the two. Henry Saxby was the island doctor for most of his residence on Unst. In 1871, he took his family to Argyllshire, but he was already ill and he died two years later. He had started work on a manuscript, eventually published in 1874  as The Birds of Shetland after it was edited and annotated by Stephen Saxby, who was now a vicar in Somerset."]}, {"page": "Saxby (surname)", "response": ["*Stephen Martin Saxby (1804\u20131883), English meteorologist and naval officer "]}]}}
