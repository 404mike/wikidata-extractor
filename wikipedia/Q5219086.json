At this point Bold entered the field, publishing in 1697 a Discourse on the true Knowledge of Christ Jesus, in which he insists, with Locke, that Christ and the apostles considered it enough for a Christian to believe that Jesus was the Christ. To the sermon he appended comments on Locke's essay and Vindication, declaring the essay 'one of the best books that had been published for at least 1,600 years,' and criticising Edwards's tracts. Edwards immediately retorted, and produced a second tract from Bolde with a preface on the meaning of the terms \"reason\" and \"antiquity\" as employed in the Socinian controversy. This was in 1697; in 1698 a third tract of Bolde's appeared, answering some Animadversions, published at Oxford. In 1699 he brought out a Consideration of the Objections to the Essay on the Human Understanding. Locke acknowledged Bolde's support in his 'Second Vindication' of his essay; and in 1703 Bold visited Locke at Oates, Essex. He was then meditating the publication of further tracts which Locke dissuaded him from proceeding with. They were, however, published in 1706, and consist of a Discourse concerning the Resurrection of the Same Body and two letters on the necessary immateriality of created thinking substance.
