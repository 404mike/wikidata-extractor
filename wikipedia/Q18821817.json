The work is signed and dated, but the date has sometimes been misread as \"1622\" instead of \"1642\". Most of the surface of River Landscape is covered by a friendly sky. The landscape below is bustling with life: fishermen, huntsmen, ducks, and drinking cattle. The castle in the background has been identified as Muiden Castle, and the river as the Vecht. Muiden Castle was a center of Dutch cultural life at this time (Muiderkring)."]}]}}
