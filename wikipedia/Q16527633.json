Alex Story, a director of the company at the time of the launch, was the creator of 18 Doughty Street. He wrote the concept on which the station was based, built the studio, and initially organised the production of the channel. Story developed the idea of creating a news platform that would challenge the dominance of terrestrial TV stations over the course of 2005 when he stood for parliament in Denton and Reddish. Over the course of the campaign, he noticed the wide cultural chasm between mainstream news channels and the people. He took his idea of an on-line TV station to Stephan Shakespeare during the first half of 2006.", "At the point of launch, there were four directors of the company; Alex Story, Iain Dale, Tim Montgomerie and Stephan Shakespeare, all  Conservative Party members and self-described conservatives, but did not represent the Conservative Party in an official capacity on the station. In late 2006  Story left as a director of the company, followed by the resignations of Montgomerie around March 2007 and of Donal Blaney in October 2007, followed by Dale later in around December 2007. The latter three were said to be leaving to focus on other projects. For Story, the aim of the channel was to provide an intellectual and cultural platform to take-on the political orthodoxy of the time; for other directors, the channel was to be narrowly focused on the politics of Westminster."]}, {"page": "List of sportsperson-politicians", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Story,Alex\"| Alex Story || Rowing (Olympic athlete)Alex Story at Sports Reference || Candidate in the 2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom at Yorkshire and the Humber"]}, {"page": "Christopher Pincher", "response": ["On 5 November 2017, Pincher resigned as Assistant Whip and voluntarily referred himself to the Conservative Party's complaints procedure and the police, after former Olympic rower and Conservative candidate Alex Story alleged that Pincher, nine years before he was an MP, had made an unwanted pass at him, describing him as a \"pound shop Harvey Weinstein\".
