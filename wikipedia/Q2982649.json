King, The History of the Telescope, Courier Corporation - 1955, page 28-29 Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by Queen Elizabeth I's chief advisor Lord Burghley. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens.Patrick Moore, Eyes on the Universe: The Story of the Telescope, Springer Science & Business Media - 2012, page 9 The idea of an \"Elizabethan Telescope\" has been expanded over the years, including astronomer and historian Colin Ronan concluding in the 1990s that this reflecting/refracting telescope was built by Leonard Digges between 1540 and 1559. This \"backwards\" reflecting telescope would have been unwieldy, it needed very large mirrors and lens to work, the observer had to stand backwards to look at an upside down view, and Bourne noted it had a very narrow field of view making it unsuitable for military purposes. The optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away, seems to be far beyond the technology of the timeFred Watson, (2007), Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope, page 40. Allen & Unwin and it could be the \"perspective glass\" being described was a far simpler idea, originating with Bacon, of using a single lens held in front of the eye to magnify a distant view.Henry C.

His son followed in his footsteps and was a pivotal player in the popularisation of Copernicus's book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. Notes written by Thomas Digges in the publication of the book Pantometria in 1570 contain descriptions of how Leonard Digges made use of a \"proportional Glass\" to view distant objects and people. Some, such as astronomer and historian Colin Ronan, claim this describes a reflecting or refracting telescope built between 1540 and 1559, but its vague description and claimed performance makes it dubious.", "The writings left by Digges' colleague William Bourne contain further detail on the experiments with lenses and mirrors conducted by Leonard Digges and his son. It is these details which led some researchers, most notably Colin Ronan, to claim that Leonard Digges invented a functioning telescope sometime between 1540 and 1559. The description seemed to suggest that Digges created a rudimentary instrument incorporating lenses and a concave mirror, in a manner rather different from a modern reflecting telescope. However, the construction of lenses to the required optical precision would have been very difficult in the 16th century, and the construction of an adequate mirror would have been much harder still. It is doubtful that Digges built a successful instrument, and the optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away was far beyond the technology of the time."]}, {"page": "R\u00f3n\u00e1n", "response": ["*Colin Ronan (1920\u20131995), British astronomer and writer"]}, {"page": "List of Old Abingdonians", "response": ["* Colin Ronan (1920\u20131995), British author and specialist in the history and philosophy of science"]}, {"page": "Timeline of telescope technology", "response": ["* 1570 \u2014 The writings of Thomas Digges describes how his father, English mathematician and surveyor Leonard Digges (1520\u20131559), made use of a \"proportional Glass\" to view distant objects and people.
