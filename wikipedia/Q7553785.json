The original house was damaged during the civil war. Its owner at the time, Sir Robert Pye, who was a Royalist, was put under siege by his own son Robert who was a Parliamentarian colonel. Building of the current, smaller, house began about 1780 and was not completed until after 1785. The house was bought in 1787 by William Hallett Esq. It was the home of Lord Berners in the mid-20th century. For a time it was owned by the writer Sofka Zinovieff, the granddaughter of Berners' companion, Robert Heber-Percy, who inherited it on Berners' death in 1950."]}, {"page": "Lord Berners", "response": ["Berners himself once said that he would have been a better composer if he had accepted fewer lunch invitations. But English composer Gavin Bryars, quoted in Peter Dickinson\u2019s biography of Berners, disagrees saying: \"If he had spent more time on his music he could have become a duller composer\". Dinah Birch,  reviewing The Mad Boy, Lord Berners, My Grandmother and Me, a biography of Berners written by Robert's granddaughter, Sofka Zinovieff, concurs saying: \"Had he committed himself to composition as his life's work, perhaps his legacy would have been more substantial. But his music might have been less innovative, for its amateur quality \u2014 'amateur in the best sense', as Stravinsky insisted \u2014 is inseparable from its distinctive flair\"."]}, {"page": "Clarissa Eden", "response": ["Among the future Clarissa Avon's many other friends, a number of whom were some years older than she, were the novelists Evelyn Waugh, Anthony Powell, and Nancy Mitford (whose sister Deborah wrote of an encounter with Lady Avon some 20 years after they had been d\u00e9butantes together that she \"found her rather alarming\"Letter from Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire, to Nancy Mitford, 27 May 1959), painter Lucian Freud, and choreographer Frederick Ashton.
