Thomas attended King Edward VI High School and then attended Newnham College, taking the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1897 and 1898. She then became a demonstrator at Royal Holloway College for two years, joining (and eventually succeeding) Dorothy Marshall. In 1901 she studied at Birmingham having obtained a Priestley Scholarship, after which she returned to Cambridge to teach chemistry at Girton College. Her work here was noted later by one of her students, Dorothy Needham (who graduated in 1919):\"It seemed that in the period at the end of the First World War the schemes followed in the Girton laboratory for experimental chemistry were incomparably better planned and organized than those available in the University Chemical Department, which then for the first time had replaced most of the separate College laboratories. This famous laboratory at Girton finally closed in 1935 when Miss Thomas retired, and the building can still be seen, though it is now used for other purposes.\"While Thomas is remembered for her work in education, she did publish with Humphrey Owen Jones on the stereochemistry of optically active nitrogen compounds. However, pressures of teaching meant that her efforts shifted to education, although she did carry out some development work on anti-gas respirators during World War I."]}, {"page": "1904 petition to the Chemical Society", "response": ["# Dorothy Marshall", "The network that allowed these women to co-sponsor the petition has been examined. Smedley, Freund, and Whiteley led the petition. Smedley attended the King Edward VI High School as did Thomas and Hartle. Freund was a demonstrator and a lecturer at Newnham College, Cambridge between 1887 and 1912, as were Elizabeth Eleanor Field, Dorothy Marshall, and Mildred Gostling. Thomas, Field, Whiteley, and Gostling spent time at Royal Holloway College, from where there were two additional petitioners: Margaret Seward and Sibyl Widdows. Clare de Brereton Evans and Millicent Taylor attended the Cheltenham Ladies' College, Cheltenham and Taylor had connections with the University of Bristol, where Emily Fortey and Katherine Williams studied. Lucy Boole studied at the London School of Medicine for Women and Katherine Burke studied at University College London under the supervision of William Ramsay - both of these women knew de Brereton Evans. Grace Toynbee studied at the University of Birmingham, and was possibly connected with Hartle. Two petitioners Edith Humphrey and Alice Smith have unknown connections to the remainder, but it is proposed that they were connected by male chemists keen to promote their cause, such William Ramsay."]}, {"page": "Dorothy Marshall (historian)", "response": ["Dorothy Marshall (26 March 1900 \u2013 13 February 1994) was an English social historian.The Times (17 February 1994), p. 19."]}, {"page": "Defending Rights & Dissent", "response": ["* Vice Chairman: Dorothy Marshall, Sylvia Crane, Charles Jackson, Harry Bernard, Reverence Edward L.

Educated at the local grammar school, he then apprenticed at Gimson and Co. engineers before going to Owens College, Manchester in 1887. He received a BSc in engineering in 1891 and worked for five years under Professor Osborne Reynolds. He then joined the University of Liverpool in 1896 and received a DSc in 1898 and became a professor the next year at University College, Bristol. He joined the National Physical Laboratory in 1901 and was involved in the testing of materials. He began wind tunnel studies in 1903 and by 1921 he had constructed a supersonic wind tunnel of 3 inch diameter going to 3.2 times the speed of sound for testing projectiles. This work was conducted secretly for the Britain's Ordnance Committee. It was here that he and Dorothy Marshall made studies on heat flow and found a relation between surface heat transfer rate, temperature difference and friction coefficients that is now known as Stanton number. Stanton was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1914 and was knighted in 1928 for his contributions to the wartime effort."]}]}}
