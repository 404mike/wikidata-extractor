K. Chesterton, a friend of Bentley, was also a practitioner of the clerihew and one of the sources of its popularity. Chesterton provided verses and illustrations for the original schoolboy notebook and illustrated Biography for Beginners. Other serious authors also produced clerihews, including W. H. Auden, and it remains a popular humorous form among other writers and the general public. Among contemporary writers, the satirist Craig Brown has made considerable use of the clerihew in his columns for The Daily Telegraph."]}, {"page": "Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon", "response": ["When Townsend and Margaret's relationship began is in contention. The princess told friends she fell in love with the equerry during the 1947 South Africa tour, where they often went riding together. Her biographer Craig Brown stated that, according to a National Trust curator, Townsend requested the bedroom next to hers during a trip to Belfast in October 1947. Alternatively, it is theorised that the relationship began around 1951. Townsend said that his love for her began in August 1951, when the princess woke him from a nap after a picnic lunch while the king watched. Townsend was so often near Margaret that gossip columnists overlooked him as a suitor for the princess. Townsend and his wife separated in 1951, which was noticed by the press by July, although exactly when she left their home is unclear. In June 1952, the estranged couple hosted Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and Princess Margaret at a cocktail party at Adelaide Cottage. A month later, Mrs Townsend and her new partner attended judging at the Royal Windsor Horse Show. The first reports that Townsend and Margaret wished to marry began in August 1952, but these remained uncommon. The divorce in November was mentioned little in Britain and in greater detail abroad.  After the divorce was finalised in December 1952, however, rumours spread about him and Margaret; the divorce, and shared grief over the death of the king in February 1952, likely helped them come together within the privacy of Clarence House, where the princess had her own apartment."]}, {"page": "Eleanor Bron", "response": ["In 2006 she narrated the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of the Craig Brown book 1966 and All That.

The novelist Anthony Burgess made no secret of his admiration for Hill. Burgess, whose novels were often comic, relished language, wordplay and dialect, admired the verbal and comedic skill that underlay Hill's success. Reviewing a biography of Hill, Saucy Boy, in The Guardian in 1990, Burgess described Hill as \"a comic genius steeped in the British music hall tradition\" (as were Chaplin and Laurel, two of Hill's childhood idols) and \"one of the great artists of our age\".

Landmarks is described on the cover as \"a field guide to the literature of nature, and a vast glossary collecting thousands of the remarkable terms used in dozens of the languages and dialects of Britain and Ireland to describe and denote aspects of terrain, weather, and nature\". Each of the book's chapters explores the landscapes and style of a writer or writers, as Macfarlane travels to meet farmers, sailors, walkers, glossarians, artists, poets and others who have developed intense and committing relationships with their chosen places. The chapter of the book concerning Nan Shepherd and the Cairngorm mountains was adapted for television by BBC4 and BBC Scotland. Macfarlane's detailed writing style, and his frequent references to dialect vocabulary, were satirised in a February 2016 edition of Private Eye by Craig Brown in the magazine's regular \"Diary\" feature. Landmarks was published in the US in August 2016.
