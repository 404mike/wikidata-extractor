Grant was born in 1911. He attended the Glasgow School of Art and soon was contributing articles, drawings, and caricatures to newspapers and magazines including The Light Car. He was injured in Normandy during World War II.\nIn August 1950 he founded Autosport magazine which he edited until his death in 1969. Autosport was significant in being a weekly devoted almost entirely to motorsport, at a time when other publications were monthly or only partly reported competition. The timing was perfect as the British motor racing scene was growing rapidly, notably the new Formula 3, based on the British 500 cc Formula.\nHe participated in many rallies and hillclimbs, including the Lyons-Charbonnieres Rally in 1952 (driving with Stirling Moss in a Jaguar XK120), and the 1955 Tulip Rally in a Triumph TR2. He entered the 1956 Mille Miglia one-thousand-mile road race in an MG Magnette. For 1957 he drove a factory-prepared Lotus Eleven. \"One man's Mille Miglia\" is an account of his experiences in the 1957 race.\nThe Autosport Magazine Gregor Grant Award for lifetime achievement in motor sport is awarded annually at the Autosport Awards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alain Prost", "response": ["*Winner of the Autosport Gregor Grant Award for Lifetime Achievement: 1994 "]}, {"page": "Autosport", "response": ["|align=left| Gregor Grant"]}, {"page": "Fernando Alonso", "response": ["Alonso received the 2003 Autosport Gregor Grant Award for winning the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix.

The DW12, with the new bumper/nerf bar section being featured, was designed to prevent many similar single-seater crashes such as the one that killed him. A charity race in Wheldon's honour was held in Milton Keynes on 6 December with drivers such as Franchitti, Jenson Button and Anthony Davidson competing. Proceeds from the event were donated to a charity selected by Wheldon's family. That month, Wheldon was posthumously awarded the Gregor Grant Award for his lifetime career achievements that his father Clive and Franchitti collected. Former racing driver Mark Dismore's New Castle Motorsports Park, which organises the Robo-Pong 200 endurance karting event that Wheldon won in 2005, named the trophy the Dan Wheldon Cup in 2012. The Wheldon family added a Wheldon Memorial Pro-Am to the event in 2013. On 7 March 2012, Wheldon's widow Susie and mayor Bill Foster unveiled a street sign in St. Petersburg, Florida.
