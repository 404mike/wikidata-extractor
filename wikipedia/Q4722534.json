For a time he was associated with the far right of the Conservative Party, and during the 1930s was a leading member of the Friends of National Spain, which stressed support for Francisco Franco and anti-communism. He had also declared himself to be an admirer of Benito Mussolini although, in keeping with a number of contemporary Tories who admired the southern European fascists, he was critical of Adolf Hitler.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of actor-politicians", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Denville, Alfred\"| Alfred Denville || Actor and theatre impresario || Conservative || MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (1931-1945)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Alfred Denville"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Alfred Denville"]}, {"page": "Denville Hall", "response": ["The hall includes part of a 16th-century house called Maze Farm.
