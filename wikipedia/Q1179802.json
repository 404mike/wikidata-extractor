He represented England at international level, playing 13 times for his country. He also played once for the England B team.\nBorn in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, Cockburn attended Stamford High School and began his football career as a forward with Goslings FC in the early 1940s. He joined Manchester United in 1943, turning professional in August 1944. However, because of the Second World War, he had to wait until 1946 for his league debut, by which time he had been converted into a wing half. He also made his England debut against Northern Ireland that year.\nWith United, Cockburn won the 1948 FA Cup and the 1952 league title. He left United in October 1954, joining Bury where he ended his league career after two seasons.
