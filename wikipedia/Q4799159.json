He wrote extensively on topics as varied as nineteenth-century English liturgical composition, Schubert, Purcell, Edmund Rubbra, and baroque concertos; but his most famous book was the Companion to Mozart's Piano Concertos, published in 1948 and often reissued since. Among his other books are The Invention and Composition of Music and Church Music in the Nineteenth Century. During the late 1970s his articles on music regularly appeared in the monthly magazine Records and Recording. His compositions include the Seasonal Preludes for organ, the overture Oriana Triumphans, the opera Marriage \u00e0 la Mode, and the operetta The Plumber's Arms. Among his choral works are Hosanna to the Son of David, God is Gone Up, Grant Them Rest, and the Communion Service on Russian Themes.\nHutchings served for many years as a director of the English Hymnal Company and three of his tunes were included in the 1986 New English Hymnal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Feast of the Ascension", "response": ["Settings of God is gone up have been composed by William Croft, Arthur Hutchings and Gerald Finzi (words by Edward Taylor). Phillip Moore's anthem The Ascension sets words based on Psalm 24 verses 7-10. Other settings suitable for the occasion include William Matthias's Lift up your heads."]}, {"page": "Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)", "response": ["The work is one of Mozart's most advanced compositions in the concerto genre. Its early admirers included Ludwig van Beethoven and Johannes Brahms. Musicologist Arthur Hutchings declared it to be, taken as a whole, Mozart's greatest piano concerto.", "Among modern and twentieth-century scholars, Cuthbert Girdlestone states that the concerto \"is in all respects one of [Mozart's] greatest; we would fain say: the greatest, were it not impossible to choose between four or five of them.\" Referring to the \"dark, tragic and passionate\" nature of the concerto, Alfred Einstein states that \"it is hard to imagine the expression on the faces of the Viennese public\" when Mozart premiered the work. The musicologist Simon P. Keefe, in an exegesis of all of Mozart's piano concertos, writes that the No. 24 is \"a climactic and culminating work in Mozart's piano concerto oeuvre, firmly linked to its predecessors, yet decisively transcending them at the same time.\" The verdict of the Mozart scholar Alexander Hyatt King is that the concerto is \"not only the most sublime of the whole series but also one of the greatest pianoforte concertos ever composed\". Arthur Hutchings's view is that \"whatever value we put upon any single movement from the Mozart concertos, we shall find no work greater as a concerto than this K. 491, for Mozart never wrote a work whose parts were so surely those of 'one stupendous whole'.\""]}, {"page": "List of Durham University people", "response": ["* Arthur Hutchings \u2013 professor of music in Durham, author of books on Mozart's piano concertos and Jean-Philippe Rameau"]}, {"page": "Cyril Rootham", "response": ["Henry Colles recognised Rootham's style as \"vigorous and genial\", reflecting his personality. The Symphony no. 1 in C minor epitomises this musical vigour, especially the first and last movements which Arthur Hutchings considers to contain Rootham's most characteristic music. Another Rootham trademark evident in the symphony is his almost vocal writing for brass. His refined string writing is showcased in the Rhapsody on the old English tune Lazarus."]}, {"page": "Piano concertos by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "response": ["For a long time relatively neglected, Mozart's piano concertos are recognised as among his greatest achievements.
