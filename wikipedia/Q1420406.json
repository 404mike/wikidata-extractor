A section in that book entitled \"Nuclear Bombs and the Weather\" states: \"The dust raised in severe volcanic eruptions, such as that at Krakatoa in 1883, is known to cause a noticeable reduction in the sunlight reaching the earth ... The amount of [soil or other surface] debris remaining in the atmosphere after the explosion of even the largest nuclear weapons is probably not more than about one percent or so of that raised by the Krakatoa eruption. Further, solar radiation records reveal that none of the nuclear explosions to date has resulted in any detectable change in the direct sunlight recorded on the ground.\"The Effects of Nuclear Weapons  Samuel Glasstone, Washington DC, Government Printing Office, 1956, pp. 69071.  A similar report had been issued in 1950 under a slightly different title:  . This earlier version seems not to have discussed Krakatoa nor other climate change possibilities. The US Weather Bureau in 1956 regarded it as conceivable that a large enough nuclear war with megaton-range surface detonations could lift enough soil to cause a new ice age."]}, {"page": "Firestorm", "response": ["This break from the linear expectation of more fire damage to occur after greater explosive yield is dropped can be easily explained by two major factors. First, the order of blast and thermal events during a nuclear explosion is not ideal for the creation of fires. In an incendiary bombing raid, incendiary weapons followed after high-explosive blast weapons were dropped, in a manner designed to create the greatest probability of fires from a limited quantity of explosive and incendiary weapons. The so-called two-ton \"cookies\", also known as \"blockbusters\", were dropped first and were intended to rupture water mains, as well as to blow off roofs, doors, and windows, creating an air flow that would feed the fires caused by the incendiaries that would then follow and be dropped, ideally, into holes created by the prior blast weapons, such into attic and roof spaces.De Bruhl (2006), pp. 210\u201311.Taylor, Bloomsbury 2005, pp. 287,296,365.Longmate (1983), pp. 162\u20134. On the other hand, nuclear weapons produce effects that are in the reverse order, with thermal effects and \"flash\" occurring first, which are then followed by the slower blast wave. It is for this reason that conventional incendiary bombing raids are considered to be a great deal more efficient at causing mass fires than nuclear weapons of comparable yield. It is likely this led the nuclear weapon effects experts Franklin D'Olier, Samuel Glasstone and Philip J. Dolan to state that the same fire damage suffered at Hiroshima could have instead been produced by about 1 kiloton/1,000 tons of incendiary bombs."]}, {"page": "Samuel T. Cohen", "response": ["Cohen's parents were Austrian Jews who emigrated from London, England.  He was born on January 25, 1921, in Brooklyn and raised in New York City.  He studied mathematics and physics at University of California, Los Angeles before joining the United States Army after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  In 1944 he worked on the Manhattan Project in the efficiency group at Los Alamos and calculated how neutrons behaved in Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan.  After the war he studied for his Ph.D. at Berkeley before dropping out to join the RAND Corporation.  At RAND Corporation in 1950, his work on the intensity of fallout radiation first became public when his calculations were included as a special appendix in Samuel Glasstone's book The Effects of Atomic Weapons.  Cohen was personally responsible for recruiting the famous strategist Herman Kahn into the RAND Corporation.http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&id=817"]}, {"page": "George Irving Bell", "response": ["Such problems are also crucial in the design and analysis of nuclear reactors, so it was natural that Bell became a leading expert on the physics of reactors.

He was the author of 13 books and more than 250 articles. In his early years he worked with Cyril Hinshelwood on the theory of chemical kinetics, extending this during his doctoral work to the theory of absolute reaction rates with  Henry Eyring and Samuel Glasstone. As an independent researcher in Ottawa he worked increasingly on enzymes, with both theoretical and experimental studies. He wrote several books of chemistry, and among these The Chemical Kinetics of Enzyme Action was for more than ten years by far the most important source of information on the subject. After his retirement Laidler increasingly worked on the history of science, and wrote books on the history of physical chemistry and its relationship with technology."]}, {"page": "One Second After", "response": ["The book contains a brief non-fiction afterword by U.S. Navy Captain William Sanders, regarding EMPs, which includes references to the reports of the United States EMP CommissionUS Government, Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack website and the book The Effects of Nuclear Weapons by Samuel Glasstone and Philip J.

He explained this by establishing the concept of C\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O interactions. The first crystallographic analysis of C-H \u22efO hydrogen bonds were published by June Sutor in 1962."]}]}}
