Here, he gained a first in Classical Moderations, becoming a senior scholar, and graduating with first class honours in English.\nAfter graduation, Harris gained his teaching certificate, and in 1926 he was appointed Lecturer in Classics and English at St David's College, Lampeter. In 1934, he was made Professor of Classics, taking responsibility for English during the Second World War. He remained in the post until his retirement in 1968.\nHarris was responsible for a great deal of teaching at Lampeter. All St David's students were, at this time, expected to study Greek for two years. Simultaneously, the numbers wishing to study English at the college were increasing. This left little time for his personal research interests. Yet he did manage to publish various books and articles, including Greek Athletes and Athletics in 1964, and Sport in Greece and Rome in 1968. These aroused great interest worldwide, and resulted in countless invitations to lecture on the subject.\nHarris took a great interest in sport himself, particularly cricket. He possessed a vast knowledge of English County and Test cricketers, and was involved with the Lampeter XI. He also took a prominent role in many college dramatic productions. He visited Greece and Italy on an annual basis, being prevented only during the war years. These visits resulted in him being made a senior lecturer on the official Greek cruise tours. He died suddenly at Oxford in 1974.\nA hall of residence at St David's College, which is now the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, is named for Harris.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Wales, Lampeter", "response": ["*Professor Harold Arthur Harris (Latin and Greek)"]}, {"page": "1974 in Wales", "response": ["*29 August (in Oxford) \u2013 Harold Arthur Harris, academic, 71"]}, {"page": "1902 in Wales", "response": ["*27 October (in Oxford) \u2013 Harold Arthur Harris, academic (died 1974)"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Harris", "response": ["*Harold Arthur Harris (1902\u20131974), British classical scholar"]}, {"page": "University of Wales Trinity Saint David", "response": ["*Harold Arthur Harris Hall"]}, {"page": "Harold Harris", "response": ["*Harold Arthur Harris (1902\u20131974), British classical scholar"]}, {"page": "Harris, Harold", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harold Arthur Harris"]}]}}
