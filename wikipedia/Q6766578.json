One original house survives from the time of the pool's enclosure. Behind Pool Valley is Old Steine (historically The Steyne), originally a flat and marshy area where fishermen dried their nets.

And so in Lewes, with the authorities grudgingly accepting it and the Police just watching, the Bonfire Boys marked the spot where the Lewes Martyrs had been burnt at the stake and marched with burning crosses to increase their notoriety and as a snub to the liberal elite. Out of this the tradition we know today was born and tacit permission was granted to make it a local custom so Lewes man could assert their liberties, whether as a Protestant under a Catholic throne or to protest authority, and as a protest for social justice and over inequalities.

According to family tradition, Elizabeth was a direct descendant of a martyr of the Marian Persecutions, possibly John Forman, who was burnt at East Grinstead in 1556. Matthew's father Thomas Caffin was employed by the Onslow family, who owned Drungewick Manor close to the border of Sussex and Surrey. When Matthew was around 7 years old, Richard Onslow adopted him as a companion for his own son Richard. The two boys were educated at a grammar school in Kent and in 1643 both were sent to All Soul's College, Oxford to study for the Church of England ministry. However he soon faced difficulties at All Soul's College for questioning infant baptism and the Trinity and then advocating Baptist tenets. The university attempted to induce Caffyn to suppress his own views, but failed and he was then expelled in 1645. Now 17, Caffyn returned to Horsham and was installed at Pond Farm in Southwater by his adoptive father. He quickly joined a General Baptist church there, and was appointed assistant to the local General Baptist minister, Samuel Lover. Caffyn's apparent campaigning vigour brought about a significant increase in local adherents, and by 1648 he had taken over the ministry from Lover."]}, {"page": "English county histories", "response": ["*Mark Antony Lower, Worthies of Sussex (1865)"]}, {"page": "Cornish corporate heraldry", "response": ["Mark Antony Lower noted in 1845 that \"In general the arms assigned to a county are those of one of its chief, or most antient, boroughs.

As is usual in Sussex lore, the Devil is depicted in a foolish light, in this case 'the wife' gets the better of him.

Mark Antony Lower, an anti-Catholic propagandist and schoolmaster from Lewes, inaugurated the cult of the Sussex martyrs after the publication of his 1851 book The Sussex Martyrs to recall the dire actions of Catholicism in Sussex.   Hostility to the Roman Catholic church, strong shortly after the Reformation had virtually died out by the early 19th century when religious tolerance was dominant mood.  This began to change with the Evangelical Revival.  The first Methodists to preach in Lewes were Calvinist Methodists, who saw the world as a sharp contrast between good and evil, God and the devil.  The natural recipients of their negative projections were Catholics, who were becoming tolerated in England.  More petitions were to come out of Lewes against Catholic emancipation that any other town in southern England.  They came not from the old dissenters who favoured toleration but from the newly-formed Calvinist congregations.  The local press in Lewes pandered to these prejudices.  The introduction of ritualist practices in the Anglican church further increased anti-Catholic attitudes in Lewes.
