According to Foreman, instead of being supported by a mass membership, as AI is, HRW depends on wealthy donors who like to see the organization's reports make headlines. For this reason, according to Foremen, it may be that organizations like HRW \"concentrate too much on places that the media already cares about\", especially in disproportionate coverage of Israel."]}, {"page": "The Patriot (2000 film)", "response": ["The Patriot was criticized for misrepresenting atrocities during the Revolutionary War, including the killing of prisoners of war and wounded soldiers and burning a church filled with townsfolk. While atrocities occurred during the war, the most striking of the film's depictions of British atrocities\u2014the burning of a church full of unarmed colonial civilians\u2014had virtually no factual basis nor parallel in the American or European 18th century wars, with the exception of the Massacre at Lucs-sur-Boulogne (fr) in 1794, which was a purely French affair with no connection to British troops nor the American Revolution. The New York Post film critic Jonathan Foreman was one of several focusing on this distortion in the film and wrote the following in an article at Salon.com:", "The most disturbing thing about The Patriot is not just that German director Roland Emmerich (director of Independence Day) and his screenwriter Robert Rodat (who was criticized for excluding the roles played by British and other Allied troops in the Normandy landings from his script for Saving Private Ryan) depicted British troops as committing savage atrocities, but that those atrocities bear such a close resemblance to war crimes carried out by German troops\u2014particularly the SS in World War II. It's hard not to wonder if the filmmakers have some kind of subconscious agenda... They have made a film that will have the effect of inoculating audiences against the unique historical horror of Oradour\u2014and implicitly rehabilitating the Nazis while making the British seem as evil as history's worst monsters... So it's no wonder that the British press sees this film as a kind of blood libel against the British people.Jonathan Foreman, 'The Nazis, er, the Redcoats are coming!', Salon.com, July 3, 2000.

In January 2012, Chris Blackhurst, editor of The Independent, told the Leveson inquiry that the scandal had \"severely damaged\" the newspaper's reputation. He nevertheless told the inquiry that Hari would return as a columnist in \"four to five weeks\". Hari later announced that he would not return to The Independent. Jonathan Foreman contrasted The Independents reaction to the scandal unfavourably with the reaction of American newspapers to similar incidents such as the Jayson Blair case, which led to resignations of editors, \"deep soul-searching\", and \"new standards of exactitude being imposed\". The historian Guy Walters suggested that Hari's fabrications had been an open secret amongst the newspaper's staff and that their internal inquiry was a \"facesaving exercise\".

The Village Voices J. Hoberman called the film a \"philosophical gross-out comedy rudely presented from the perspective of a sullen, sexually curious 14-year-old\".
