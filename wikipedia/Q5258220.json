His group is also part of the Oxford Centre for Integrative Systems Biology. After a first career in Neurobiology, working on cell growth and movement, Dennis Bray moved in Cambridge to develop computational models of cell signaling, in particular in relation to bacterial chemotaxis.\nOn 3 November 2006 he was awarded the Microsoft European Science Award for his work on chemotaxis of E. coli.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jean-Pierre Changeux", "response": ["In his PhD thesis, Changeux suggested that the recognition and transmission of signals by membrane, and in particular by synapses, could use the same mechanisms as the allosteric regulation of enzymes. More than forty years of research would follow, mainly focussed on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (see below). In 1967, Changeux extended the MWC model to bi-dimensional lattice of receptorsChangeux J.-P., Thi\u00e9ry J.-P., Tung Y., and Kittel C. (1967). On the cooperativity of biological membranes. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 57, 335-341. (an idea that would also be developed three decades afterward by Dennis BrayBray D, Levin MD, Morton-Firth CJ (1998) Receptor clustering as a cellular mechanism to control sensitivity. Nature, 393: 85-88.). He then applied this idea to the post-synaptic membrane of electric organs (analog to striated muscle).Changeux J.-P., Podleski T.R. (1968).

(1973) Presence of a lattice structure in membrane fragments rich in nicotinic receptor protein from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. FEBS Lett. 33: 109-113. His team demonstrated the existence of several interconvertible states for the nicotinic receptor, resting, open and desensitized, displaying different affinities for the ligands, such as the endogenous agonist acetylcholine.Weber M., David-Pfeuty M.T., Changeux J.-P. (1975). Regulation of binding properties of the nicotinic receptor protein by cholinergic ligands in membrane fragments from Torpedo marmorata. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72: 3443-3447.Sugiyama H., Changeux J.-P. (1975). Interconversion between different states of affinity for acetylcholine of the cholinergic receptor protein from Torpedo marmorata. Eur. J.

Biochem. 94: 255-279. The transitions between the states followed different kinetics, and those kinetics plus the differential affinities sufficed to explain the shape of the post-synaptic potential. A full mechanistic model of the nicotinic receptor from striated muscle (or electric organ) was to be provided much later, when Changeux collaborated with Stuart Edelstein, another specialist of allostery, who worked decades on hemoglobin.Edelstein S., Schaad O., Henry E., Bertrand D. Changeux J.-P. (1996). A kinetic mechanism for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors based on multiple allosteric transitions. Biol. Cybern. 75: 361-379 In addition to the allosteric modulation of the channel gating by the agonists, many other regulations of the ligand-gated ion channels activity have since been discovered. The modulators bind to a variety of allosteric sites, whether on the agonist binding sites, other binding sites at the subunit interfaces, on the cytoplasmic part of the protein or in the transmembrane domain.Changeux J.-P.

In his book Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell (2009) Dennis Bray explains his theory that cells, which are the most basic form of life, are just a highly complex computational structure, like a computer. To simplify one of his arguments a cell can be seen as a type of computer, utilizing its own structured architecture. In this architecture, much like a traditional computer, many smaller components operate in tandem to receive input, process the information, and compute an output. In an overly simplified, non-technical analysis, cellular function can be broken into the following components: Information and instructions for execution are stored as DNA in the cell, RNA acts as a source for distinctly encoded input, processed by ribosomes and other transcription factors to access and process the DNA and to output a protein. Bray's argument in favor of viewing cells and cellular structures as models of natural computational devices is important when considering the more applied theories of wetware in relation to biorobotics."]}, {"page": "Bray (surname)", "response": ["*Dennis Bray, British scientist"]}, {"page": "Microsoft Award", "response": ["| Dennis Bray"]}, {"page": "Singularity Summit", "response": ["Lance Becker, Dennis Bray, Ben Goertzel, David Hanson, Demis Hassabis, Ellen Heber-Katz, Ray Kurzweil, Shane Legg, Brian Litt, Steven Mann, Ramez Naam, Irene Pepperberg, James Randi, Terry Sejnowski, Mandayam Srinivasan, Gregory Stock, John Tooby, Michael Vassar, Eliezer Yudkowsky"]}, {"page": "Keith Burridge", "response": ["He was born in 1950 in Dorset, England.
