This could have been a motive for Phelan when Ken is later found unconscious at the bottom of his stairs that night (see Who Attacked Ken?), and he himself becomes a prime suspect on the police investigation along with Ken's family. He is soon taken in for questioning when Ken's son Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) informs the police that Phelan had never phoned an ambulance when finding his father unconscious on the night of the attack, and his adoptive sister Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) later recalls Phelan's quarrel with their father on the day before his attack; the accusations made by Ken's children have additionally caused Todd and several residents, including Ken's close friends Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and Brian Packham (Peter Gunn), to believe that Phelan is the assailant. At the police station, Phelan is interrogated by DS MacKinnon (Sandra Huggett) \u2014 the policewoman leading the investigation on Ken's attack \u2014 and her assistant DC Hough (Philip Hill-Pearson) over his fraught interaction with Ken. Afterwards, Phelan calls Todd with a desperate request of providing him an alibi. Todd initially refuses to help Phelan, reminding him of their recent altercation, but later changes his mind when he finds evidence of his stepfather's innocence; Todd's earlier recording of Phelan had captured the exact time when he was fixing Luke's house. Because of this, Phelan is eliminated from the enquiry into Ken's attack and he later invites Todd for a drink in The Rovers as thanks; with the pair finally embarking on a mutual bond as they make amends with each other.
