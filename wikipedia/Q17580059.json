Johnstone spent time on loan with Conference club Macclesfield Town and League Two clubs Cheltenham Town and title-winners Burton Albion in 2014\u201315 and spent the 2015\u201316 season on loan at Greenock Morton in the Scottish Championship. Johnstone departed the Blues and signed for League Two club Colchester United in June 2016. \nJohnstone joined St Johnstone in a season-long loan for 2017\u201318 before being released by Colchester at the end of that season. After a season with Greenock Morton, he signed for Falkirk in 2019, spending time on loan at Stranraer before joining Dumbarton in July 2020.Johnstone has represented Scotland at under-16, under-17, under-18 and under-19 levels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Greenock Morton F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Denny Johnstone (on loan from Birmingham City)"]}, {"page": "John McGreal", "response": ["After Kevin Keen left Colchester following the club's relegation to League Two on 26 April 2016, McGreal was appointed his successor on 4 May. He did not take charge of Colchester until after the final game of the 2015\u201316 season, in which his assistant Steve Ball was named caretaker. The club signed a number of players in preparation for the 2016\u201317 season, including defenders Luke Prosser (who he appointed as captain) and Lewis Kinsella; midfielders Brennan Dickenson, Craig Slater and Doug Loft; and forwards Courtney Senior, Kurtis Guthrie, and Denny Johnstone. However top-scorer George Moncur was sold to Barnsley for \u00a3500,000. In his first match in charge on 6 August, McGreal guided his side to a 1\u20131 opening day draw away to Hartlepool United. He earned his first win on 13 August as his side defeated Cambridge United 2\u20130 at the Colchester Community Stadium. After three wins and one draw in Colchester's opening five league fixtures, McGreal was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award for August. After an eleven-game winless run, McGreal's side went undefeated in December, earning ten points from a possible twelve which propelled Colchester up the League Two table away from the relegation zone. In turn, McGreal was shortlisted for the League Two Manager of the Month award for December. He won the award on 6 January 2017, becoming the first Colchester manager to win the award since Paul Lambert in January 2009. Later that month he signed Sean Murray on a free transfer from Swindon Town. The \"U's\" finished the season eighth in the table, one place and one point behind Blackpool in the play-offs, who would go on to achieve promotion.

Early season promise faded in late September with a winless run that stretched to the end of November. A turn in fortunes saw the U's win seven out of eight league games through December into January, earning John McGreal the December League Two Manager of the Month award. They again suffered patchy form from January onwards until a late push for the play-offs saw a return to form in April.

Dickenson's performance earned him a place in the English Football League Team of the Week for all three divisions. The same day, the club completed two transfer deals to assist the development squad. Young left-back JJ Wilson joined Maldon & Tiptree on loan for one month, while former Barnet trainee full-back Brendan Ocran signed a one-year development contract.

A late consolation goal from Brennan Dickenson reduced the deficit, while both Charley Edge and Rekeil Pyke made their professional debuts from the bench as the club slipped to 10th in the league table. Colchester then suffered their first back-to-back defeats since November when they lost 2\u20131 at Accrington Stanley on 18 February. First-half goals from Billy Kee and Matty Pearson handed Accrington the advantage before Omar Beckles was shown a red card for a tackle on Brennan Dickenson just before the break.
