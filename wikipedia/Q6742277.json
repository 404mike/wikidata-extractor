Many of the other students had studied more mathematics at school. In his second year he replaced physics with physiology. He took three years to obtain his Part\u00a0I. For his Part\u00a0II he studied biochemistry and obtained a 1st Class Honours.

The first version was published in 1961, and the Enzyme Commission was dissolved at that time, though its name lives on in the term EC Number. The current sixth edition, published by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 1992 as the last version published as a printed book, contains 3196 different enzymes. Supplements 1-4 were published 1993-1999.
