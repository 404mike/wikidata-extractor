It designs and manufactures household appliances such as vacuum cleaners, air purifiers, hand dryers, bladeless fans, heaters, hair dryers, and lights. As of February 2018, Dyson had more than 12,000 employees worldwide. In January 2019, it was announced that Dyson would move its headquarters to Singapore to ramp up manufacturing for their electric vehicle (EV), stating Asia trade will be their main focus and commenting that the company was unhappy with EU/UK bureaucratic restrictions; however, the termination of the EV programme was announced on 10 October 2019.", "In 1974, James Dyson bought a Hoover Junior vacuum cleaner, which lost suction after a period of use. Frustrated, Dyson emptied the disposable paper bag to try to restore the suction but this had no effect. On opening the bag to investigate, he noticed a layer of dust inside, clogging the fine material mesh.", "Later, Dyson was working on his ballbarrow at a company he had founded (but no longer entirely owned) where a large vacuum system was used to contain the fusion bonded epoxy coating that was sprayed on the wheelbarrow arms as a powder coating.  Dyson found the system inefficient, and was told by equipment manufacturers that giant cyclone systems were better.  Centrifugal separators are a typical method of collecting dirt, dust and debris in industrial settings, but such methods usually were not applied on a smaller scale because of the higher cost.James Dyson - Against the Odds He knew sawmills used this type of equipment, and investigated by visiting a local sawmill at night and taking measurements.  He then built a 30-foot model for the ballbarrow factory.  While constructing this at home, Dyson realized the function of the cyclone was to extract dust without clogging.  Wondering if this could be applied at a smaller scale to a home vacuum, he constructed a cardboard model with sticky tape, connected it to his Hoover with its bag removed, and found it worked satisfactorily.", "Using the income from the Japanese licence, James Dyson set up Dyson Appliances Limited in 1991. The first dual-cyclone vacuum built under the Dyson name, the DA 001, was produced by American company Phillips Plastics in a facility in Wrexham, Wales, beginning in January 1993 and sold for about \u00a3200. Vacuum assembly took place in the unused half of the plastic factory. Due to quality control concerns and Phillips's desire to renegotiate the terms of their contract to build the vacuum cleaner, Dyson severed the agreement in May 1993. Within two months he set up a new supply chain and opened a new production facility in Chippenham, Wiltshire, England; the first vacuum built at the new facility was completed 1 July 1993. The DA 001 was soon replaced by an almost identical cleaner, the DC01.", "In 2014, Dyson invested in a joint robotics lab with Imperial College London to investigate vision systems and engineer a generation of household robots. In 2001 the company had been close to launching a robot vacuum, the DC06, but James Dyson pulled it from the production line as it was too heavy and slow. In 2016, Dyson launched the 360 Eye, and in 2021 the 360 Heurist.", "In September 2017, company founder James Dyson announced via email to employees that the company had 400 people working on a battery electric vehicle, secretly in the works for two years, which it hoped to release by 2021. Further information about the company's plans emerged in February 2018, with news of three electric vehicles under development as part of an estimated $3B project. In October 2019, Dyson said its engineers had developed a \"fantastic electric car\" but that it would not be taken further because it was not \"commercially viable\" and also lack of potential buyers for this project. The project employed over 500, most of them in the UK. \"This is not a product failure, or a failure of the team, for whom this news will be hard to hear and digest,\" Dyson wrote to his company.", "==James Dyson Award and James Dyson Foundation==", "The James Dyson Award is an international student design award running in 18 countries.
