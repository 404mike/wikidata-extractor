He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Taneli Kukkonen, writing in The Classical Tradition, observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\" Jonathan Barnes wrote that \"an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought\"."]}, {"page": "Alexander of Aphrodisias", "response": ["By the 6th century Alexander's commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as \"the commentator\" ().Cf.

But see Jonathan Barnes et al., (1991), Alexander of Aphrodisias, On Aristotle Prior Analytics 1.1-7, page 4, who argue: \"In all these texts Alexander is indeed referred to by phrases such as 'the commentator' or 'Aristotle's commentator'; but these phrases are not honorific titles - they are ordinary referring expressions. If, at the end of a book review, you read 'The author deserves our thanks', you will rightly take this for praise - but you will not think that the author has been honoured as The Author par excellence.\" His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the Arabs, who translated many of them, and he is heavily quoted by Maimonides."]}, {"page": "Air (classical element)", "response": ["According to Plato, it is associated with the octahedron; air is considered to be both hot and wet. The ancient Greeks used two words for air: aer meant the dim lower atmosphere, and aether meant the bright upper atmosphere above the clouds.W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy, vol. 1, pp. 466, 470\u201371. Plato, for instance writes that \"So it is with air: there is the brightest variety which we call aether, the muddiest which we call mist and darkness, and other kinds for which we have no name....\"Plato, Timaeus, ch. 27, p. 83. Among the early Greek Pre-Socratic philosophers, Anaximenes (mid-6th century BCE) named air as the arche.Guthrie, History of Greek Philosophy, vol. 1, pp. 115\u201316, 120\u201332; Jonathan Barnes, Early Greek Philosophy, pp. 77\u201380. A similar belief was attributed by some ancient sources to Diogenes Apolloniates (late 5th century BCE), who also linked air with intelligence and soul (psyche), but other sources claim that his arche was a substance between air and fire.Guthrie, vol. 2, pp. 362\u201381; Barnes, pp. 289\u201394.

This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in Aristotle's Physics where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that void does not exist.Aristotle, Physics, 213a24\u20137 There is, however, no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras. The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the corporeality of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void. The clepsydra was a common utensil and everyone who used it must have known, in some sense, that the invisible air could resist liquid.W. K. C.

Both the Suda and Sir Thomas Browne also claimed he was born during the 88th Olympiad. Another legend related that, when Plato was an infant, bees settled on his lips while he was sleeping: an augury of the sweetness of style in which he would discourse about philosophy.Cicero, De Divinatione, I, 36", "#They shared a \"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\".R.M.

This view is known as Pyrrhonian skepticism, as distinguished from Academic skepticism as practiced by Carneades, which, according to Sextus, denies knowledge altogether. Sextus did not deny the possibility of knowledge. He criticizes the Academic skeptic's claim that nothing is knowable as being an affirmative belief. Instead, Sextus advocates simply giving up belief; in other words, suspending judgment (epoch\u00e9) about whether or not anything is knowable.See PH I.3, I.8, I.198; cf. J. Barnes, \"Introduction\", xix ff., in Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Scepticism. Julia Annas and Jonathan Barnes (transl.) (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000).
