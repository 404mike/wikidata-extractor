Retrieved 19 November 2011 Parts of the old hospital can still be seen in the modern building, including archways and walls. Under the stage lies a well, which is believed to be dated from the Roman era of York's history.  The 1744 theatre replaced a theatre in Minster Yard, built by Thomas Keregan, with the encouragement of the City Corporation, in 1734.  Twenty five years after its construction, in 1769, Tate Wilkinson paid \u00a3500 for a Royal Patent, and, accordingly, it was renamed the Theatre Royal. Wilkinson ran a company that included theatres in Hull, Leeds, Pontefract, Wakefield and other Yorkshire towns. His company was reckoned to be the leading provincial company, and he attracted many of the finest actors of the period, including John Philip Kemble and his sister Sarah Siddons, Dorothea Jordan and Elizabeth Farren, to act in York. Since Wilkinson's time the theatre has undergone several renovations and upgrades. In the late 1800s the theatre was refurbished into the Victorian style, including, in 1880, a new Victorian Gothic frontage, which is decorated with carved heads representing Elizabeth I and characters from Shakespeare's plays. The latest major redevelopment was an extensive renovation of the theatre, with a new modernist foyer (architect:  Patrick Gwynne), in 1967. The theatre has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage."]}, {"page": "The Homewood", "response": ["The Homewood is a modernist house in Esher, Surrey, England.
