Clarke's team was indeed a top-class side worthy of its title as, in 1846, it consisted of himself, Joe Guy (cricketer), George Parr (all of Nottinghamshire), William Lillywhite, Jemmy Dean (both Sussex), William Denison, Will Martingell (both Surrey), Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Wanostrocht (aka \"Felix\") and William Hillyer (all Kent). Their matches in Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds were a huge success and very profitable, especially for Clarke himself who was careful to pay his players more than Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) did (from \u00a34 to \u00a36 per week) and so keep them interested.
