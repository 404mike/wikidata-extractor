Hutchinson was due to go on a one-month loan to Second Division team Ayr United in December 2010, to get match-sharpness. However, the bad weather and match postponements led to Motherwell being forced to call off the switch. Hutchinson forced his way back into the first team in the second half of the 2010\u201311 season, mainly due to the departure of first-choice centre back Mark Reynolds to Sheffield Wednesday. Hutchinson made his first appearance of the season when Mothewell and Inverness CT drew 0\u20130 on 16 January 2011. Hutchinson then scored his first goal of the season on 2 April 2011, in a 2\u20131 win over Aberdeen. After scoring his first goal of the season, Hutchinson said the goal against Aberdeen put a last laugh on Craig Brown after being overlooked by him the previous season and the start of the season. He helped Motherwell to the final of the 2011 Scottish Cup but they lost the match 3\u20130 against Celtic. Hutchinson revealed that he never expected to play in the final and couldn't stop smiling. On 2 June 2011, Hutchinson signed a two-year extension to his contract, tying him to Motherwell until 2014.
