He was also a two-time winner of the Winmau World Masters and a two-time World Cup singles champion. In total, Lowe won 15 BDO and WDF majors. He held the World No. 1 ranking on four occasions. In October 1984, he became the first player to hit a televised nine-dart finish. \nLowe is one of only six players to have won the World Championship three or more times, and was the first person to win it in three separate decades; along with Phil Taylor, he remains one of only two players to achieve this. Amidst growing dissatisfaction with the British Darts Organisation, Lowe was also one of 16 players who in 1993 broke away to form their own governing body, the World Darts Council (now known as the Professional Darts Corporation).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1945", "response": ["** John Lowe, English darts player"]}, {"page": "Chesterfield, Derbyshire", "response": ["*John Lowe (born 1945), former professional darts player, three-time darts World Champion"]}, {"page": "Darts", "response": ["The highest score possible with three darts is 180, commonly known as a \"ton 80\" (100 points is called a ton), obtained when all three darts land in the triple 20.
