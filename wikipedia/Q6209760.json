The Dart thought that Jenkyns would be missed \"a great deal more than some of [the] supporters imagine\", and that apart from Fall, who was expected to be \"a big improvement\" on Partridge, the 1895\u201396 team would be noticeably weaker than that of the season just ended."]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Goalkeeper Joe Fall signed from Newton Heath for a fee reported as \u00a320, and defender Harry Haynes joined from Wolverhampton Wanderers.

According to the Birmingham Daily Post, he should take no blame for any of the five goals conceded before half-time, due in part to the sun in his eyes and with the half-backs \"little more than landmarks on the field\". On change of ends, the balance of play tilted towards the visitors, but the match still finished 7\u20133. Fall returned to fitness for Small Heath's third defeat of the season, at home to Stoke in a game characterised by excessive foul play. At Nottingham Forest, Tommy Hands and Jack Hallam were lively on the wings, but the weakness of the half-back line was noted in yet another loss.", "|} Only around 500 spectators watched Small Heath lose 4\u20133 to Notts County of the Second Division in a friendly on a miserably wet day, the small attendance meaning that the home side would have lost money on the arrangement after paying Notts their guarantee. A game of two halves followed at Burnley on Good Friday; playing with the wind, Robertson opened the scoring for the visitors after four minutes and several shots hit the woodwork, but on change of ends Burnley forced the pace and had a goal disallowed before scoring the equaliser. The next day, Sheffield Wednesday took a 3\u20130 half-time lead playing into the sun and wind. Perhaps with the approaching FA Cup Final on their minds, they took it easy in the second half, but a weakened Small Heath team, with Fountain, Jones and Pratt replacing Hands, Haddon and Lester, were still unable to score. The Sheffield Independent picked out Leake at centre half as playing excellently, and the full-backs Oliver and Pratt as \"safe, but not too speedy\".\"Comments on Saturday's Games\". p. 3, 'Centre-Forward', \"Facts and Fancies\". p. 9, and  On Easter Monday, a goalless draw at West Bromwich Albion, thanks largely to Joe Fall and his defence, kept Small Heath out of the bottom two places with two games left to play."]}]}}
