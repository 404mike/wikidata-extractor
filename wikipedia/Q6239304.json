He studied Photography at Kyungsung University in South Korea. He was initially a photojournalist but then a decision to study fine art in the UK changed everything. In September 2005 he started at the Slade School of Fine Art where he was taught by John Hilliard, a world-renowned conceptual artist who uses photography. This encounter was to alter Bae's perspective and approach as he became a fine artist. Living in London for the past decade has not always been an easy experience for Bae. He has at times felt alienated and isolated; an outsider using an unfamiliar language and living in a different culture. He describes a sense of dislocation, almost disconnection. \u00a0He also experienced, for the first time, racial prejudice which forced him to consider Western centric ideology that seeks to place a man like himself as \u2018other\u2019. \u00a0He describes this as the Western need to \u201cexclude and diminish differences\u201d. This sense of \u2018outsiderness\u2019 has become a core part of his work, as has his exploration of his own identity."]}]}}
