The family's finances were often stretched, but Greenslade probably developed a love of reading from his mother. He was educated at a state school in Woodford; from there, he won a highly competitive scholarship to Christ's Hospital. There, under the headship of William Hamilton Fyfe, he enjoyed a rich musical and classical education, and won a classical scholarship to Hertford College, Oxford, where he studied under J. D. Denniston. He graduated with a second-class degree in 1927. By that time, he had turned to Anglicanism and spent a year reading for the theology honours school, in which he placed in the first class in 1928.Henry Chadwick, \"Stanley Lawrence Greenslade, 1905\u20131977\", Proceedings of the British Academy, vol. 72 (1987), pp. 409\u2013410."]}]}}
