", "Important explorative and descriptive work was done by Alfred von Radio-RadiisAlfred von Radio-Radiis (1875-1957) was actually of Italian birth and descent, belonging to a prominent family from Gorizia. He became a founding member of the prestigious Club Alpino Accademico Italiano (CAAI) in 1904. But as CEO of the Saurer Truck Company, he always remained loyal to his Austrian allegiances. See: http://www.saurer-mein-laster.at and Hanns Barth.They jointly published their findings in the course of three years in an extensive report \"Die Brentagruppe\" in the Zeitschrift des D\u00d6AV 1906, page 327-361, Zt. 1907, page 324-364, Zt. 1908, page 361-398. A treasure! with gorgeous photographic images by Radio-Radiis himself, as well as illustrations by E.T. Compton. German speaking alpinists like Gottfried Merzbacher, Steck, Mayr, Adang, HeinemannAn exhaustive overview of particulars about all these early alpinists is to be found on http://www.angeloelli.it/index.htm and others left their mark on the Brenta Dolomites. Around the turn of the century a competitive spirit developed between Italian and German speaking alpinists, which took its main inspiration from the emerging nationalistic feelings in the region. Besides that, the explorative character of alpinism gave way to the ascent of rock climbing as a sport. The completion of the Italian unification in 1870 triggered expectations in Italian speaking Tyrol. The spirit of Irredentismo was increasingly present among the local alpinists, who had founded in 1872 their own Societ\u00e0 degli Alpinisti Tridentini. In 1882 they constructed the first mountain hut located within the Brenta Group, close to Bocca di Brenta: Rifugio Tosa, at 2439 m. Local Alpinists like Carlo and Giuseppe Garbari and Nino Pooli, started to follow in the tracks of the local guides Matteo & Bonifacio Nicolussi and Antonio Dallagiacomo, who had led all the foreigners to the summits. The antagonism with the Germanic climbers was exacerbated by an alleged practice of piggybacking on Italic efforts. The D\u00d6AV Sektion Bremen decided to construct a large mountain hut at the rocky saddle just above the Rifugio Tosa in 1897.The legal procedure to reclaim the property of this building for the SAT actually succeeded before the Vienna Supreme Court in 1914. After the war it was named after Trentino wartime volunteer Tommaso Pedrotti. Castiglioni, page 65; Girardi, page 201-203. A similar situation was created at Passo Tuckett where the SAT had constructed the small rifugio Sella in 1905 and the D\u00d6AV Sektion Berlin built a larger hut right next to it.The building was turned over to the SAT after the war and was named after the British alpinist and explorer Francis Fox Tuckett. Castiglioni, page 52. When the last undisturbed major peak in the Brenta Group, Campanile Basso, was finally climbed by Berger and Ampferer in 1899, it appeared that they had heavily relied on the work of Garbari and Pooli, who had stopped just 35 meters off the summit.see main article: Campanile Basso During the First World War the Brenta Group remained undisturbed by warfare and it is fair to conclude that after Trentino became allocated to Italy at the Treaty of Versailles, the exploration of the Brenta Group had been largely completed. The era of sports climbing had begun and innumerable climbing routes in all possible difficulty rates were traced on the vertical walls of these mountains over the years.

It lies on the Zillertal main ridge which forms the border here between the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian province of South Tyrol. Its great size makes it the dominant mountain in the area. Seen from the northwest it appears like a firn-covered dome; but from the northeast as a regularly shaped cone of rock. Prominent ar\u00eates radiate from the peak to the northwest, east and south. The mountain is easily ascended from the  Furtschaglhaus and is often visited as a result.

But when, in 1858, the Austrian alpine researcher and geographer, Anton von Ruthner, stood on the summit of this mountain, he realized that the M\u00f6seler, which he called the Schneeberg, to the west had to be significantly higher. On 12 August 1863, von Ruthner attempted an ascent of the M\u00f6seler with two guides from Breitlahner in the Zemmgrund, but in thick fog only reached the N\u00f6fes Saddle, which they initially thought was the M\u00f6seler. When, later, the fog lifted, they realized their error. However, they were not the first to have used this well-trodden, ancient crossing. Not until the tour by Englishman, Francis Fox Tuckett on 16 June 1865, with his Swiss mountain guides and local bearers, did someone successfully conquer the mountain. That tour began in South Tyrol's Lappach in the Lappach valley (now part of the municipality of Muehlwald) at four clock in the morning and headed north to the East Nevesferner. After crossing the glacier, they reached the South Ar\u00eate of the M\u00f6seler in fog, but only got as far as the southern subpeak, the significantly lower M\u00f6selekopf. As the fog lifted, they realized that they had not climbed the main peak; instead the highest point appeared to the northeast as a broad rocky summit. Finally, crossing the icy South Ar\u00eate they reached the Great M\u00f6seler after two and a half more hours at 12.30 pm. As the weather cleared, Tuckett now realized that even the tediously conquered Gro\u00dfer M\u00f6seler was not the highest mountain in the Zillertal Alps. To the west, an icy summit towered even higher above them. An angle measurement brought unwelcome confirmation: this ice pinnacle, later called the Hochfeiler, had to be the long-sought after, highest point of the mountain range. The mountaineers descended northwards to Schlegeistal valley and at around 9 pm they finally reached the Alpine hut at Breitlahner.Carl Diener in Eduard Richter (ed.): Die Erschliessung der Ostalpen, III.
