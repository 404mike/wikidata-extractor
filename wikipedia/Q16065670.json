Nilanjana Banerji \"Penley, William Sydney (1852\u20131912)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2005, accessed 22 August 2015  Although Penley's relatives included the painter Aaron Edwin Penley, his family was more generally associated with the theatre. His great-grandfather, William (1773\u20131838), a comedian at Drury Lane, was the first in a theatrical line that included Sampson (1792\u20131838) actor-manager at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, and Thomas Turpin Belville (1805\u201393), a theatre manager in Bath. Penley was educated at his father's schools \u2013 first at Grove House, St Peters, and then in London, where his father moved to a school in Westminster.\"Mr. W. S. Penley\", The Times, 12 November 1912, p. 13 He was a chorister at the Chapel Royal and at Westminster Abbey.Ayer, p. 288 After an apprenticeship with a City firm of milliners he joined the staff of Copestake, Moore, Crampton & Co, wholesale drapers and mercers. His obituarist in The Times speculated that Penley's career in retail may have been cut short by an irrepressible sense of humour ill-suited to a serious commercial concern."]}, {"page": "Penley (surname)", "response": ["*Aaron Edwin Penley (1806\u20131870), British painter"]}]}}
