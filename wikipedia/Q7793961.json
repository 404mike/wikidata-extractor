These fires were part of a scrub clearing process to encourage grass growth for emu and kangaroo. This tradition led to conflict with the colonists as the fires tended to cause considerable damage to farmland. In an official report, Major Thomas O'Halloran claimed the Kaurna also used this as a weapon against the colonists by lighting fires to deliberately destroy fences, survey pegs and to scatter livestock. Due to this regular burning by the time the first Europeans arrived, the foothills' original stringybark forests had been largely replaced with grassland. Since the late 1960s, restrictions on foothills subdivision and development have allowed regeneration of native trees and bush to a \"natural\" condition that would not have existed at the time of European occupation."]}, {"page": "O'Halloran Hill, South Australia", "response": ["Located on the foothills of the Mount Lofty Ranges and bordering the Adelaide plains, the suburb (and the hill) were named after Major Thomas O'Halloran, the first Police Commissioner of South Australia. O'Halloran was the second son of Major-General Sir Joseph O'Halloran. Majors Road, which runs through the suburb was also named in his honour."]}, {"page": "Marino, South Australia", "response": ["Local government in the area was formed in 1853, the 18th District Council constituted in South Australia.  Its name was the District Council of Brighton (as distinct from the Corporation of Brighton which formed some 5 years later, mainly as a result of the determination of local residents to improve roads in the area).  The first chairman of this new district was Thomas O'Halloran.  The first meetings were held in the Thatched House Tavern, which, if still standing, would be on the corner of Brighton and Sturt roads.  According to the 1876 Census, the District Council of Brighton totalled 328 schoolchildren of which 192 were able to read and write.  In 1886 the council, less the now small coastal Corporation of Brighton, was renamed the District Council of Marion."]}, {"page": "1840 in Australia", "response": ["* 25 August \u2013 two Ngarrindjeri men are publicly hung along the Coorong in front of their tribe after being accused of the murders of all 26 crew and passengers of the Maria shipwreck.

Hawdon named the lake that day after Bonney, while recording that the local Aboriginal people named it \"Nookampka\".  At that time it was a fine sheet of water, but was dried out and muddy three years later in 1841 when the police expedition led by Thomas O'Halloran passed by on its way to rescue other overlanders at the Rufus River."]}, {"page": "Sylvester O'Halloran", "response": ["In 1752 Sylvester married Mary Casey and they had four sons and a daughter.
