He was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford. Unlike his father, a Tory who resisted the Reform Bill, George was a progressive Whig and Liberal, making their relationship somewhat cool. Sir John much preferred his estate at Halton House to that at West Wycombe Park, so George took up residence in the latter shortly after marrying his mother's niece, Elizabeth Broadhead (d. 24 May 1889), daughter of Theodore Henry Broadhead, on 17 March 1823.\nSir John left politics in 1831, in the face of popular agitation for electoral Reform, and George stood for Parliament the following year, being returned as Member of Parliament for Buckinghamshire. He held that seat until 1835. In 1837, he was returned for the borough of Wycombe, formerly his father's seat, and remained one of its Members of Parliament until his death in 1865.Dashwood succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1849. He liquidated his grandfather's estates in Lincolnshire and Wales, in 1851, and used the money so raised to overhaul the estate at West Wycombe. He also sold off the contents of Halton House in 1849, and the estate itself in 1853.\n\nDashwood died at West Wycombe Park aged 71. With no issue, he was succeeded by his brother John, leaving his wife Elizabeth as life tenant of West Wycombe. She subsequently built St Paul's Church at West Wycombe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Wycombe Park", "response": ["Sir John was succeeded by his estranged son Sir George Dashwood, 5th Baronet.

West Wycombe was to cause a great deal of trouble for Dashwood: Lady Elizabeth Dashwood, Sir George's widow, had been given life tenancy of the property and inherited most of his personal effects.
