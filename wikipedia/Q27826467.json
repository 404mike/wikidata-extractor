Iaukea was deeply touched by the high expectations of his deceased benefactor. After finishing his education, he served King Kamehameha V as a k\u0101hili bearer and steward at the palace, awaiting an assignment from the king. In 1872, the king sent Iaukea and William K. Hutchison, the son of Ferdinand William Hutchison, to Lahaina where they learned the art of sugar boiling in the growing sugar industry on Maui, and helped manage the West Maui Sugar Plantation, in which the king had a share. They were placed under the care of Governor Paul Nahaolelua. After the king's death in 1872, Iaukea briefly left his service to the royal court and moved to Hilo to live with his sister Maraea and her husband Charles Akono Nui Akau, a Chinese-Hawaiian manager of the Pauka\u02bba Sugar Plantation.;  The listless Iaukea enjoyed his new-found independence, but he also felt unfulfilled. He later wrote: \"I was dangling at a loose end. And even though I was enjoying my independence, I was aware that I did not know just where I was going or what I ought to do. I was frustrated without realizing it.\""]}, {"page": "Hutchison", "response": ["*Ferdinand William Hutchison (1819\u20131893), British physician and politician in the Kingdom of Hawaii"]}, {"page": "Victoria Kam\u0101malu", "response": ["Kam\u0101malu became ill during a party given at the Bishop's residence in Hale\u0101kala, Honolulu, in February 1866.
