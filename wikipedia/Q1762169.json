At the time this made him the youngest ever outfield player to appear for Wednesday, and the third youngest in all behind goalkeepers Peter Fox and Gary Scothern. Two weeks later he came on in the second half for Lee Briscoe in the 1\u20130 defeat away to Tottenham Hotspur.\nHe turned professional on 16 October 1996, but failed to appear in the Wednesday first team whilst a professional. He joined Torquay United in March 1999, making his Torquay debut in a goalless draw away to local rivals Plymouth Argyle on 8 March.
