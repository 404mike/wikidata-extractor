While in England in 1792-1793, James Markham Marshall (the future chief justice's younger brother) agreed to buy the Fairfax family's claim to the Leeds Manor and South Branch tracts (which totaled 215,000 acres) from Martin for 20,000 pounds sterling, with closing scheduled for February 1, 1794. The Marshalls organized former Revolutionary War friends and relatives -- James and John Marshall, Lighthorse Harry Lee (later bought out by James Marshall) and Rawleigh Colston (husband of Elizabeth Marshall) -- who then needed to arrange financing.According to Smith p. 101, another shareholder was John Ambler, possibly the richest man in Virginia after inheriting Jamestown Island, and who briefly served as a delegate for James City County as well as married Lucy Marshall, sister of James and John. In fact, John Marshall had turned down both George Washington's offer to make him the Attorney General of the United States, and his temporary position as Attorney General of Virginia (since James Innes left the state) in order to pursue this land claim.Smith pp. 163-166</reF><ref>Marshall papers p. 144 The Marshalls' arrangement was initially financed by Robert Morris (whose daughter was James Marshall's wife), but he overextended himself in various speculations as became apparent in the Panic of 1797.
