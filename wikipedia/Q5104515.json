His teammate, Tommy Johnson, scored a club record of 38 league goals that season. Brook scored once, and Johnson scored five times, in a 6-2 defeat of Everton in September that season. In the 1929\u201330 football season Brook helped Manchester City to third in the league. The City team had been strengthened by the acquisition of the outside right Ernie Toseland and the wing half Matt Busby. Brook scored a brace in a 6-1 victory against Liverpool in October that season. Brook also scored in a 10-1 victory against Swindon Town in the fourth round of the 1929\u201330 FA Cup. City were defeated 2-1 by Hull City in the subsequent round. In the 1930\u201331 football season City bought the prolific Scottish centre forward Dave Halliday from Arsenal as a replacement for Tommy Johnson. Despite this, Brook was the club's top scorer that season with 16 goals, and was also the club's top scorer in 1935\u201336. He often played in the centre forward position for his club, roaming the pitch, which later drew comparisons with Don Revie and N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti in this position. In the 1931\u201332 season the City team, which now included the Scottish centre forward Alec Herd, managed to reach the semi-final of the FA Cup but were defeated by Arsenal by 1\u20130 with a goal from Brook's England teammate Cliff Bastin. Brook had scored a brace in a 6\u20131 demolition of Brentford in the fourth round of that year's competition.

The third round draw saw an unusual number of contests between First Division clubs; twelve top-flight teams faced a fellow First Division club. Manchester City were among this number, with a home tie against six-time cup winners Blackburn Rovers. Manchester City won 3\u20131 in front of the largest crowd of the round. The Manchester Guardian described City's win as \"notable... ...for the surprising ease with which it was gained\". The wing play of Eric Brook and Ernie Toseland was central to the victory. Brook scored the first goal on a rebound after his shot from a free-kick was blocked. Blackburn then equalised, but Toseland scored either side of half-time to make the score 3\u20131. City were then drawn away against Second Division Hull City. Two quick goals shortly before half-time gave Manchester City a 2\u20130 lead, but Hull regrouped in the second half. First Jack Hill headed a goal from a corner, then, under pressure from Bill McNaughton, Bill Dale diverted a Hull cross into his own net for the equalising goal. Following the 2\u20132 draw, the Blues resoundingly won the replay 4\u20131. Sheffield Wednesday were the opponents in the Fifth Round. Once again a score draw was fought out. However, Manchester City won the replay by two goals to none. The Sixth Round was a home tie with Stoke City, a match seen by 84,569 fans, which is still the record highest attendance at an English club ground. The Potters were beaten 1\u20130, setting up an intriguing semi-final against Aston Villa, who had knocked out the three-time champions Arsenal in the previous round.

He scored twice in the next match, away to Exeter City. The first was a tap-in after Toseland's shot rebounded to him off the goalpost, the second, to clinch a 3\u20131 win, came from a solo run in which he dribbled past centre-half, both backs and the goalkeeper to walk the ball into the net.
