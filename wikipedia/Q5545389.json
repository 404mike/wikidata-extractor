Ubsdell was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace, but was primarily a wicketkeeper.\nUbsdell made his first-class debut in 1864 for Hampshire against local rivals Sussex. The match was Hampshire's first match with first-class status. Ubsdell played in fifteen first-class matches for the club between 1864 and 1870, the last of which came against Lancashire.\nIn his fifteen matches Ubsdell scored 170 runs at an average of just 6.80. Ubsdell has the unusual statistic for a wicketkeeper of having more stumpings (13) than he had catches (4).\nUbsdell died in Liverpool, Lancashire on 15 October 1905.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* George Ubsdell (1864\u20131870): G Ubsdell"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*George Ubsdell, cricketer, was born in Southampton"]}, {"page": "Ubsdell, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Ubsdell"]}]}}
