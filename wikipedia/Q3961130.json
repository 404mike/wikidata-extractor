Critical reviews for Little Deaths were polarized and the United Kingdom DVD release had to have some portions removed due to their sexually violent content.", "Simon Rumley's short focuses on the dysfunctional relationship between Pete (Tom Sawyer) and Claire (Kate Braithwaite). Claire routinely subjects Pete to emotional and physical abuse and, in the bedroom, makes him participate in various BDSM activities such as forcing him to live and behave as a dog while he gets pegged. It would appear that the reason behind Claire's abusive behavior towards Pete is that she is extremely cynophobic and takes out her anger on the dogs she fears by treating her boyfriend like a dog. Pete longs for his relationship with Claire to get better and for her to give him more respect and acceptance, but is pushed to his limit when Claire decides, in front of Pete, to sleep with his best friend Al (Tommy Carey).  Pete is devastated and plots his revenge; he destroys all the dog-like artifacts in the house, and then gradually acquires a whole pack of feral dogs, which he deliberately keeps hungry. At home with Claire, he persuades her to be handcuffed naked to their bed, on the pretext he wants to have anal sex with her. But instead he pours dog food on to her buttocks and then releases the entire pack of starving dogs into the bedroom. The film closes to a background of Claire\u2019s agonised screams."]}, {"page": "Offscreen Film Festival", "response": ["The festival's guests have included Jack Hill, Mark Hartley, Alex Cox, Jess Franco, Bruce Bickford, Phil Mulloy, Simon Rumley, Luigi Cozzi, Monte Hellman, Suzan Pitt, Ruggero Deodato, Umberto Lenzi,\"Une brochette d'eplorateurs, \u00e7a vous dites\", Le Soir John Waters, Martha Colburn, Peter Strickland, Radley Metzger, Robin Hardy, Martine Beswick, Bruno Forzani & H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cattet."]}, {"page": "The Mercy", "response": ["* Crowhurst, a 2017 film on the same subject directed by Simon Rumley"]}, {"page": "Selina Giles", "response": ["Giles began her acting career with a minor role in a 1993 episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, followed with minor roles in Restoration (1995) and a 1995 episode of Highlander: The Series.
