Despite reportedly not being a football fan, he was responsible for one of the strip's more definitive looks in its early '80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former 2000\u00a0AD artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style quite similar to White's.Rob Davis on Roy of the Rovers Monthly, Dinlos and Skilldos, 19 March 2009 A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip's creative team. Tony Harding often illustrated Roy for the Roy of the Rovers annuals and also drew the Roy's Action Replay strip that appeared in All Action Monthly in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the Match of the Day strips for all four years."]}, {"page": "Action (comics)", "response": ["* Look Out For Lefty was an unconventional football strip based on the adventures of Kenny Lampton, a working-class teenager whose powerful left foot gave him the nickname of \"Lefty\". It was unlike any other football strips in British boys' comics at the time because the strip would include football hooliganism, as well as Lefty often not being a clean-cut hero, being prone to brawling, partying, and womanising. The violence on display in the strip mirrored the real-life football violence taking place at the time. After the ban, the strip became a conventional Roy of the Rovers\u2013type strip and removed any hint of controversy. The strip was written by Tom Tully, with art from Barrie Mitchell and Tony Harding."]}, {"page": "Tom Tully (writer)", "response": ["* 1976\u20131977 Look Out For Lefty (with art by Barrie Mitchell and Tony Harding, in Action)"]}, {"page": "Bullet (DC Thomson)", "response": ["*Twisty: Twisty Lunnon was a fantastic footballer, with an attitude, who also raced pigeons in his spare time and sometimes had brushes with the law.
