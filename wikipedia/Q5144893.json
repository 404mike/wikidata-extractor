He is also a Distinguished Senior Fellow in the Institute of Philosophy,  School of Advanced Study, University of London and Emeritus Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Oxford. He was formerly Chief Executive of the British Medical Research Council (MRC). He is best known to the public as a communicator of science but also as the target of a long-running animal rights campaign. According to The Observer, he has been both \"one of the most powerful scientists in the UK\" and \"a hate figure for the animal rights movement\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 1", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Colin Blakemore, British neurobiologist"]}, {"page": "Johannes Vermeer", "response": ["Several points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist Colin Blakemore, in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene. Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of chromatic aberration, particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the virginal. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror."]}, {"page": "Corpus Christi College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Prof Sir Colin Blakemore", "File:Colin blakemore.jpg|Colin Blakemore, neurobiologist, attended Corpus Christi College in 1962."]}, {"page": "National Secular Society", "response": ["*Professor Colin Blakemore"]}, {"page": "1944 in science", "response": ["* June 1 \u2013 Colin Blakemore, English neuroscientist."]}, {"page": "Reith Lectures", "response": ["The first Reith lecturer was the philosopher and later Nobel laureate, Bertrand Russell.

But I worry about the principle of where the moral boundaries lie. There is only one very secure definition that can be made, and that is between our species and others.\" Blakemore suggests that it would be necessary to perform research on great apes if humans were threatened by a pandemic virus that afflicted only humans and other great apes.Connor, Steve.

The primary recommendation is that the use of chimpanzees in research be guided by a set of principles and criteria, in effect to greatly limit government-funded research using chimpanzees.  Falling short of calling for the out-right ban of using chimpanzees for research, the report acknowledged that new emerging, or re-emerging diseases may require the use of chimpanzees, echoing Professor Colin Blakemore's concern."]}, {"page": "Colin McGinn", "response": ["In 1984, McGinn discussed John Searle's Reith lectures on BBC Radio Three with Searle, Richard Gregory and Colin Blakemore.
