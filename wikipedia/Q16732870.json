Kiss My Arp peaked at #73 on the CMJ Radio 200 and #2 on the CMJ RPM Charts in the U.S. Electronic music producer David Morley was an important part of her musical output as co-writer and almost all her studio work took place in his studio, which was then in Germany.", "In 2002, Parker formed the Touchin' Bass imprint after splitting from Mo' Wax, citing problems with the label's management merger, and the subsequent hold up in releasing any of her further projects. With her long-time production partner David Morley, her output became rooted in a darker, less organic sound than her work with Mo' Wax. Her output referenced classic electro music from the 1980s, relying heavily on the use of drum machines such as the Roland TR-808, as well as electro's Miami Bass connection by collaborating with DJ Assault and DJ Godfather on her Freaky Bitches 12\"."]}, {"page": "Apollo Records (Belgium)", "response": ["* David Morley \u2013 Tilted"]}, {"page": "Synton Fenix", "response": ["* David Morley"]}, {"page": "David Morley", "response": ["David Morley may refer to:", "* David Morley (barman) (1967\u20132004), English barman and murder victim", "* David Morley (administrator) (born 1954), British diplomat", "* David Morley (poet) (born 1964), British poet", "* David Morley (swimmer) (born 1965), Bahamian swimmer", "* David Morley, partner of international law firm Allen & Overy", "* David Morley (musician) (born 1965), electronic musician", "* David Morley (writer) (born 1962), British writer and radio producer", "* David Morley (paediatrician) (1923\u20132009), British pioneer in children's health care"]}]}}
