After playing five games, Walker found himself unable to cement a first team place, and moved to Hampshire after the 1948 season. A product of Slaithwaite C.C., and a sound and reliable batsman who could go in anywhere in the batting order, he had six years at Hampshire before returning to Huddersfield, where he was in the cinema business. He was professional with Golcar C.C. in 1943 and 1944, with Littleborough C.C. in 1945, and he  played both for Brighouse C.C. and Windhill C.C.\nIn 1959, he was with David Brown Tractors C.C., when they won the Yorkshire Council final.\nHe played 126 first-class matches for his adopted county until 1954, winning his cap in 1949.  A right-handed batsman and right arm medium pacer, he scored eight centuries, all for Hampshire, with a best of 150 not out.  He scored 5,258 runs at an average of 27.67, with twenty six  fifties and he took 89 catches.  He took fifty three wickets at 49.33, with a best return of 5 for 40.\nWalker died in December 1992, in Lindley, Huddersfield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walker (surname)", "response": ["*Clifford Walker (1877\u20131954), American politician", "*Clifford Walker (cricketer) (1919\u20131992), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Clifford Walker", "response": ["Walker served consecutive two-year terms as the 64th Governor of Georgia as a Democrat from 1923 to 1927, after winning with the support of the Ku Klux Klan.Lucket, Robert E.  \"Thomas Hardwick (1872\u20131944)\" http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/thomas-hardwick-1872-1944 Walker made few legislative advances during his term as governor, and is largely remembered for his membership in the KKK and his inclusion of KKK leadership in policy matters throughout his term.Huff, Christopher Allen.  \"Clifford Walker (1877\u20131954)\" http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/clifford-walker-1877-1954  His additional political service included the office of Mayor of Monroe, Georgia."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Clifford Walker 46"]}, {"page": "Clifford (name)", "response": ["*Clifford Walker (cricketer) (1919\u20131992), British athlete in cricket "]}, {"page": "David Gay", "response": ["Following the end of the war, Gay continued in military service with the Queen's Bays. In 1947, he was promoted to the rank of Captain. Having been a talented sportsman before the war, Gay featured in first-class cricket, being selected in 1949 to play for the Combined Services against the touring New Zealanders at the Garrison Ground 2. Gay was dismissed for a duck in the Combined Services first-innings by Ces Burke, while in the New Zealanders first-innings he bowled 31 overs of his right-arm medium pace, though without taking a wicket. He made a second first-class appearance for the Combined Services in the same season against Hampshire at the United Services Recreation Ground, Portsmouth.  He again made a duck in the Combined Services first-innings, falling to the bowling of Clifford Walker.  He claimed two wickets in Hampshire's first-innings, those of David Blake and Reginald Dare, finishing the innings with figures of 2/61 from 23 overs, while in their second-innings he took figures of 4/57 from 15 overs. In that same season, he played two first-class matches for Sussex in the County Championship against Glamorgan at The Saffrons, Eastbourne, and Surrey at the County Ground, Hove. This was his only season of first-class cricket, though he did feature for the Free Foresters in non-first-class matches in 1951 and 1952."]}]}}
