Boucher was an adaptable player, who although selected mainly as a forward, often played at centre. He was strong, quick for his position and passed well on the run. He was often noted for his kicking skills and kicked several drop goals each season even as a forward. Boucher was one of the last great all-round Welsh players before positional specialisation was adopted. Boucher played for the invitational Barbarians and became their club secretary between 1894 and 1899. He is the maternal grandfather of Dick King-Smith.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
