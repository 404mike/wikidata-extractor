Two women artists, Helen Saunders and Jessica Dismorr, who had turned to 'cubist works' in 1913, joined the rebels \u2013 and, although they were not regarded highly by the men, Brigid Peppin argues that Saunders's 'juxtapositions of strong and unexpected colour' may have influenced Lewis's later use of forceful colour.Brigid Peppin, 'Women That a Movement Forgot', Tate, Etc.  22 (summer 2011), p. 35.", "The publication of BLAST could not have come at a worst time, as in August 1914 Britain declared war on Germany.

When John Quinn died, in 1927, his collection of Vorticist works was auctioned and dissipated to now untraceable purchasers, presumably in America.Greene, 'Ezra Pound and John Quinn', p. 81.

There is also a (positive) critique of Kandinsky's Concerning the Spiritual in Art, a faintly patronising exhortation to suffragettes not to destroy works of art, a review of a London exhibition of Expressionist woodcuts, and a last dig at Marinetti by Wyndham Lewis:"]}, {"page": "Art of the United Kingdom", "response": ["Vorticism was a brief coming together of a number of Modernist artists in the years immediately before 1914; members included Wyndham Lewis, the sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein, David Bomberg, Malcolm Arbuthnot, Lawrence Atkinson, the American photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn, Frederick Etchells, the French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Cuthbert Hamilton, Christopher Nevinson, William Roberts, Edward Wadsworth, Jessica Dismorr, Helen Saunders, and Dorothy Shakespear. The early 20th century also includes The Sitwells artistic circle and the Bloomsbury Group, a group of mostly English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, including painter Dora Carrington, painter and art critic Roger Fry, art critic Clive Bell, painter Vanessa Bell, painter Duncan Grant among others. Although very fashionable at the time, their work in the visual arts looks less impressive today.Wilson, 127\u2013129; Mellon, 182\u2013186 British modernism was to remain somewhat tentative until after World War II, though figures such as Ben Nicholson kept in touch with European developments."]}, {"page": "Bertram Brooker", "response": ["Brooker's first set of abstracts, from 1922 to 1924, and later works such as Ascending Forms, c.1929, appear to be inspired by the Vorticist paintings of Wyndham Lewis (1882\u20131957), David Bomberg (1890\u20131957), William Roberts (1895\u20131980), and Helen Saunders (1885\u20131963). The art of this group, particularly that of Lewis, used abstraction in sharp-edged lines to denote movement in a violent, slashing way. Brooker's first abstracts are influenced by the English group's use of precisely defined geometrical forms in aggressive contortions and highly saturated hues. Although Brooker imitated Vorticist and Futurist forms, he was by no means a proponent of the politics of those movements."]}, {"page": "Jessica Dismorr", "response": ["Apart from Dismorr, the only other female member of the Vorticist group was Helen Saunders. William Roberts's painting The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915, from 1961\u201362, shows the seven males dominating the foreground and the two women behind with Dismorr in the doorway being the furthest away. According to Kate Lechmere, the financial backer of Blast and the Rebel Art Centre, Dismorr had a difficult relationship with Wyndham Lewis, and was, along with fellow artist Helen Saunders, one of the \"little lapdogs who wanted to be Lewis\u2019s slaves and do everything for him\". Lechmere claimed that on one occasion Dismorr stripped naked in Oxford Street to demonstrate she would do anything Lewis asked of her. Dismorr and Wyndham Lewis fell out in 1925 when she refused to purchase some drawings from him when he was short of money but they appeared to have resumed a cordial friendship in 1928 when she did lend him some funds. Robin Ody, a close friend and the executor of Dismorr's will (in which all the beneficiaries were women), summed her up as \"the Edwardian phenomenon of the new woman\". Ody considered that she did not have a physical relationship with Lewis. Lechmere's relationship with Lewis ended bitterly, and she carried out a legal struggle to recover money owed her by him. Lechmere had provided all the funds to pay for the Rebel Art Centre, where the Vorticists first met in 1914\u2014a fact which Lewis had to admit to Christopher Nevinson who had not wanted \"any of these damned women\" in the group."]}, {"page": "Saunders", "response": ["* Helen Saunders, British artist"]}, {"page": "Tate Britain", "response": ["* Helen Saunders: Monochrome Abstract Composition"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Central School of Art and Design", "response": ["* Helen Saunders"]}, {"page": "Kate Lechmere", "response": ["By 1915, Lechmere had distanced herself from the Vorticists and she does not appear in William Roberts' painting The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915 (completed 1961\u20132), unlike the other female painters important in the Vorticist movement, Jessica Dismorr and Helen Saunders,The Women Vorticists \u2013 Helen Saunders.

Her studio also gave her a focus of sociability.
