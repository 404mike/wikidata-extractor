A baron in the peerage of Ireland, he sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for thirteen of the years between 1806 and 1830.\nLord Rancliffe's politics were those of an advanced whig, with links to radicalism, and by the 1830s he supported many of the demands of the Chartists. His championing of progressive causes was later tempered by his private support for protectionism, and had always jarred with his public image as a playboy enjoying his inherited wealth. The History of Parliament describes him as an \"aristocratic buffoon\".\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
