He founded groups significant in the British history of organic farming. He was said to have sympathised with Nazism and participated in inter-war far right politics, but this was speculation based on his approval of the German Youth Movement's aims of involving townspeople in country community life, such as helping with the harvest. He organised summer camps with music, dance and community aims across class and cultures. His forestry methods were far ahead of their time and he was a founder member of The Soil Association.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Environmentalist", "response": ["* Rolf Gardiner (rural revivalist)"]}, {"page": "D.

The house in which he was born, 8a Victoria Street, is now the D. H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum. His working-class background and the tensions between his parents provided the raw material for a number of his early works. Lawrence roamed out from an early age in the patches of open, hilly country and remaining fragments of Sherwood Forest in Felley woods to the north of Eastwood, beginning a lifelong appreciation of the natural world, and he often wrote about \"the country of my heart\"Letter to Rolf Gardiner, 3 December 1926. as a setting for much of his fiction."]}, {"page": "John Eliot Gardiner", "response": ["Born in Fontmell Magna, Dorset, son of Rolf Gardiner and Marabel Hodgkin, Gardiner's early musical experience came largely through singing with his family and in a local church choir. As a child he grew up with the celebrated Haussmann portrait of J. S. Bach, which had been lent to his parents for safe keeping during the Second World War. A self-taught musician who also played the violin, he began to study conducting at the age of 15. He was educated at Bryanston School, then studied history at King's College, Cambridge, where his tutor was the social anthropologist Edmund Leach.\"John Eliot Gardiner\", in Contemporary Musicians (1999), Detroit: Gale", "Gardiner is the son of the British rural revivalist Rolf Gardiner (1902\u20131971), and the grandson of the Egyptologist Alan Gardiner (1879\u20131963).
