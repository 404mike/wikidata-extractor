He was part of the Kidderminster Harriers youth system but found first team opportunities limited to seven appearances in the Football League, and moved to Solihull Borough. At Solihull he was a prolific striker and earned a move to Nuneaton Borough. After just a few months at Nuneaton, Burton Albion secured his signature for a small fee. Corbett joined the Brewers as a striker but has found more success at right back and right midfield, and won the club's Player of the Season award in 2005.\nCorbett was part of the 2008/2009 Conference National winning squad and signed a new deal with the club in May 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burton Albion F.C.", "response": ["* 2005   Andrew Corbett", "|  Andrew Corbett"]}, {"page": "Richard Jackson (footballer, born 1980)", "response": ["On 22 October 2009, Jackson was set to sign for Darlington as one of four new players brought in by manager Steve Staunton, but Jackson's own deal fell through.
