Described as a dark magic practitioner who was active centuries ago, this version was initially defeated by Merlin and Etrigan the Demon, with his spirit trapped in the \"Dreamstone\", an ancient magical artifact contained in the House of Mystery and monitored by John Constantine. Ritchie Simpson is manipulated into bringing the Dreamstone together to save his own life, which restores Destiny to life in Simpson's body. Despite his power, Destiny is defeated by Constantine, Deadman, and Jason Blood after they separate him from the Dreamstone."]}, {"page": "Jeremy Davies", "response": ["| Ritchie Simpson (voice)", "| Ritchie Simpson"]}, {"page": "List of Batman films cast members", "response": ["!
