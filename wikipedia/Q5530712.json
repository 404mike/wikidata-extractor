Her purpose is to sow division, to set blood against blood, to create suffering. She is very definitely an instrument of revenge, an object through which some ceaseless fount of malice is able to survive the grave.' Whoever 'possesses' Dido will see expressions in her face, will perceive her as alive, will be compelled to draw her and cloth her. And when she disobeys Dido, she will be punished with horrible nightmares, sleepwalking, and other compulsions. Dido exerts such power over her owner that her personality changes and her other relationships are challenged."]}]}}
