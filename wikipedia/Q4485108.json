He was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. Seventeen merchants and bankers gave evidence as to his general integrity at the trial. After his conviction, powerful influence was brought to bear on his behalf, and his case was twice argued before judges on points of law. An Italian named Angelini even offered to take Fauntleroy's place on the scaffold. The efforts of his many friends were, however, unavailing, and he was hanged in November 1824, one of the last few to be executed for forgery before it ceased to be a capital crime in 1836. This outcome was in contrast to that of the fraudster Lancelot Cooper who was compared to Fauntleroy by The Times in 1827. He was also condemned to death  but subsequently had his sentence commuted to transportation (probably due to the influence of John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare)."]}, {"page": "John Fitzgibbon", "response": ["*John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare (1792\u20131851), Privy Councillor and Governor of Bombay"]}, {"page": "John Fitzgibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare", "response": ["#REDIRECT John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare "]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare (1792\u20131851), Governor of Bombay (1831\u20131835)"]}, {"page": "List of governors of Bombay Presidency", "response": ["|John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare"]}, {"page": "Priscilla Bertie, 21st Baroness Willoughby de Eresby", "response": ["* Hon.

As a result, Cooper was dismissed from the Royal Navy for misconduct. In his petition Cooper makes no mention of his disgrace stating \"he remained in her (the Princess) until the fall of 1813\". He then asserts that he embarked on a Royal Navy ship from Plymouth carrying dispatches to Admiral Sir John Gore, who was blockading Venice, then under French rule. When he reached Gore, as Napoleon had just abdicated, he was asked by Gore to go ashore and liaise with the Austrian authorities as His Britannic Majesty's Consul. This version was later contradicted by Gore in a letter to William Powell in 1825 in which Gore stated that Cooper had arrived on his ship, asked to be reinstated as secretary which was refused, and was put ashore without further delay. Notwithstanding this true version of events, Cooper did indeed manage to convince the Austrians that he was the newly appointed Consul and evidence for this is provided by a letter written by John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare (1792-1851) to an unknown recipient from Whitehall on 25 April (1827):"]}, {"page": "Christ Church, Byculla", "response": ["Christ Church in Byculla, Mumbai, is affiliated to the Church of North India and was built in 1833 as an Anglican church. The church's establishment has been the subject of a myth that it was built to suit the convenience of the Governor of Bombay, Mountstuart Elphinstone, who reportedly had to earlier travel from his central Bombay residence in Parel to St Thomas Cathedral in South Bombay. Elphinstone had already left India in 1829. The church was, in fact, built during the governorship of John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare, who laid the foundation stone in July, 1832.", "The church's establishment is closely associated with the affairs of Christ Church School, which was founded as a charity institution by the Bombay Education Society at St Thomas Cathedral, Fort in 1816\u201317. Following a government order, the school moved to the Byculla site in 1825. In 1831, for the benefit of the children, a plan for a church was announced. The education society pledged 10,000, and the government gave an equal grant on the condition that the children be provided \"sittings free of charge\". In July 1832, John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare, the then Governor of Bombay, laid the foundation stone and the building was ready by August 1833. Though the first service was held on 10 August, 1833, the church was only consecrated two years later in December 1935 by Revd. Daniel Wilson, the then Bishop of Calcutta."]}]}}
