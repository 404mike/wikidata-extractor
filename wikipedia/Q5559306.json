He made a total of 284 league appearances in a 15-year career in the Football League.\nIn 1914, he signed with Sheffield Wednesday. He moved on to Leeds United in August 1920, before joining Wigan Borough in 1923, where he scored a remarkable 21 goals in 23 games. The following year he signed with Stoke City, and remained with the club for seven seasons, helping the \"Potters\" to the Third Division North title in 1926\u201327. He had a brief spell with Rhyl Athletic before ending his career in 1934 following a two-year spell with Port Vale.\nHis grandfather, Tom, was a cricketer who played for England in their inaugural Test match.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Armitage", "response": ["Armitage's grandson, also called Tom, was a professional footballer for Sheffield Wednesday F.C. who died on New Year's Eve 1923, after suffering an injury on the pitch a few days earlier.

His second appointment came in June 1932, with the club in the Second Division. He signed wingers Bob Morton and Jimmy McGrath, and led the Vale to a club record 9\u20131 victory over Chesterfield on 24 September. After top scorer Stewart Littlewood picked up an injury, he signed ex-England international Louis Page as a replacement; and also boosted the club's defence by signing Len Armitage. In January 1933, he sold left-back Jimmy Oakes to Charlton Athletic for \u00a33,000. His team finished four points above relegation in 1932\u201333, and he released Billy Easton, Louis Page, Stewart Littlewood, Tom Tippett, Jock Leckie, and Ben Davies, whilst Wilf Kirkham retired.", "He signed players such as Trevor Rhodes, Jack Vickers, Ken Gunn, and Billy Tabram, the result of which was an eighth-place finish in 1933\u201334 \u2013 then a record best for the \"Valiants\".

The club said goodbye to long serving custodian Bob Connelly and former England international and Villa legend Richard York.

However the club again narrowly avoided relegation and had little cause for celebration, though a profit was made financially. Once more the club had a clear out. Under-performers were let go, as was Kirkham, who chose to pursue a career in education rather than football. The club had a strong 1933\u201334 on the pitch, finishing in eight place. Billy Tabram held strong at the back while Tom Nolan was scoring consistently. However the season was a financial disaster. As a result, fifteen players were let go, including Bill Cope, Jimmy McGrath and Len Armitage, Tabram was sold to Hull City for a good profit, as was Fred Mills and George Poyser to Leeds United and Brentford respectively. The 1934\u201335 season was largely forgettable on the pitch, apart from a close FA Cup game with eventual runners-up West Bromwich Albion. However, in the middle of the season there were calls for a change of name; supporters were barely in favour, with names such as 'Stoke Central' and 'Stoke United' suggested. A meeting of shareholders discussed the name of 'Stoke North End', though the eventually settled on 'Hanley Port Vale'.
