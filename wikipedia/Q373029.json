He won an English Football League winner's medal with Everton in 1928, and served Luton Town as a player and manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jackie Milburn", "response": ["Cousin to the mother of Jack and Bobby Charlton, Milburn played two trial matches at St James' Park as a 19-year-old in 1943. In the second of these, he scored six second half goals. Milburn made his competitive debut in the FA Cup in the 1945\u201346 season and was initially deployed on the left wing as a supplier to Charlie Wayman. However, Wayman was dropped before a 4\u20130 defeat to eventual winners Charlton Athletic in a 1947 FA Cup semi-final and when he afterwards vowed not to play for United again, manager George Martin made the decision to switch Milburn to centre forward. In his next match, on 18 October 1947, Milburn wore the number nine shirt for the first time and scored a hat-trick.", "The 1947\u201348 season began with a new manager after George Martin took charge after Seymour stepped down. Hutchinson claimed that: \"the pressure on United to get out of Division Two was enormous\"Hutchinson, 2004: 150 but they opened the season with a 6\u20131 win against Plymouth Argyle, with Milburn scoring.Kirkup, 1990: 26 Leading scorer Wayman was sold to Southampton in October, leading to a discussion between Martin, Seymour (now a director), Harvey, trainer Norman Smith and Milburn about his replacement:Martin: \"Jackie's the man\".Smith: \"No, keep him at inside-left or on the wing\".Harvey: \"Aye, he's not good enough in the air for centre-forward\".Milburn (violently shaking his head): \"They're right. I'm not cut out to lead the attack. I'm happy where I am\".Martin: \"You're wrong, all of you. Jackie will make a centre-forward and will get a cap into the bargain!\"Hutchinson, 2004:152\u20133 Milburn, who later described Martin as \"one of the most astute managers I've ever met\", reluctantly accepted the decision and he later admitted that the switch \"changed my life\".Joannou, 2004: 119 Despite suffering a sleepless night through nerves, in the very next match against Bury, Milburn scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20133 win.Kirkup, 1990: 24 In his next two games Milburn scored three more goals. By January\u20131948 Milburn's goals had helped Newcastle to second place in the league. According to Hutchinson, Luton Town arrived on 3\u2013January \"to face 64,931 fans and a Jackie Milburn blitzkrieg\".Hutchinson, 2004: 156 Milburn scored a hat-trick, prompting the Sunday Sun to write: \"Milburn's refreshing pace and enterprise dominated proceedings...his speed and abandon encourage high hopes that he will spearhead United to promotion\". Despite defeat at Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup and the controversial sale of Shackleton to Sunderland in February,Hutchinson, 2004:158 a Milburn goal to beat Bury 1\u20130 in March kept Newcastle in third place. United lost just one game from January to the end of the season, conceding just twice at home in that time, and were promoted in second place with a game to spare.Potter, 2010: 74\u20135 Milburn finished the season as top-scorer with 20 goals in 40 matches."]}]}}
