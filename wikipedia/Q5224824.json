Halfway through the season, Horwood began competing with Darren Campion and Michael Liddle over a left\u2013back position. He then regained his first team place in late\u2013January in the absence of Liddle's international commitment. After suffering a knee injury in February, his return was short\u2013lived when he briefly suffered a neck injury. Despite this, he had a handful of first team appearances until his sending off for second bookable offence, in a 1\u20131 draw against Cheltenham Town on 25 April 2009. At the 2008\u201309 season, Horwood made the total of 28 appearances."]}]}}
