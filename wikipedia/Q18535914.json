He came to prominence in the early 1980s, with the publication of two volumes of poetry - mainly written in free verse - Noethni in 1983 and Jazz yn y nos three years later. In the same period, he began to apply his poetry to music, performing as a singer and guitarist, initially with his Triawd (Trio), which evolved into his current backing group, Rhai Pobl (Some People). The influence of the Blues is very significant in both his poetic and musical style.\"Steve Eaves\" (Welsh language). Shon Williams. BBC LLEOL. British Broadcasting Corporation. Jazz, folk and rock are also cited as musical influences. His band has always included some of the most talented musicians on the Welsh language music scene, and currently includes Eaves' long-time collaborator, multi-instrumentalist Elwyn Williams, drummer Gwyn 'Maffia' Jones, double bassist Pete Walton and eminent folk musician Stephen Rees, as well as Eaves' daughter, Manon Steffan Ros. The late poet Iwan Llwyd was the band's bassist for some twenty years. Allusions to Christianity, Taoism and left-wing political activism are frequent in his lyrics, the latter a reflection of his earlier involvement in the radical Welsh language movement Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg and the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement.  His acclaimed 2007 album Moelyci, recorded over a six-year period, largely deals with his reaction to the death of his wife, Si\u00e2n.  To date, he has released ten albums and two volumes of poetry.", "Eaves' eldest daughter, Lleuwen, is an accomplished jazz singer, musician and composer. She has released a number of acclaimed albums, including a jazz re-working of Welsh Revivalist hymns, Duw a \u0174yr, Penmon, and award-winning T\u00e2n, which includes compositions in both Welsh and Breton.
