An old tradition, considered credible by antiquarian Joseph Gillow, holds that the funds were diverted to complete the furnishings of George IV's Royal Pavilion at Brighton.Gillow, Joseph. \"Douai college and the Brighton Pavilion\", The Athenaeum, No.3199, February 16, 1889, p. 215"]}, {"page": "Hugh Tootell", "response": ["During his sojourn abroad he wrote and published Pax Vobis: An Epistle to the Three Churches (London, 1721); and while at Harvington he composed several spiritual, controversial, and historical treatises most of which have never been published.
