By modern-day calculations, Derby County would have been the first ever table toppers because of their superior goal difference which was +3 after the first game.  Albion won 2\u20130 at Stoke in front of 4,500 spectators and would have headed Preston North End, Derby County and Everton by virtue of an infinite goal average as they kept a clean sheet. Goal Average was the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded.  Goal Average was used to separate teams who were tied on points at that time. Preston defeated Burnley 5\u20132, Derby were 6\u20133 winners at Bolton and Everton secured the points in a 2\u20131 victory over Accrington. Aston Villa defender Gershom Cox was thought to have earned the distinction of scoring the first ever league goal with an unfortunate own goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Fred Dewhurst opening the scoring minutes later at Preston with the first intentional goal.
