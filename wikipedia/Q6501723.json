He made 141 league appearances for the East Anglian club during that time, despite primarily being the understudy to goalkeepers including David Best and Paul Cooper. He  also played two games on loan to Lincoln City in the 1978\u201379 season. Sivell was noted for his bravery, typically diving at the feet of oncoming strikers to snatch the ball, and had considerable athletic ability to offset his diminutive size (for a goalkeeper). Sivell contributed to Ipswich's victorious 1980-81 UEFA Cup campaign, making one appearance during the run. However he wasn't part of the squad for the final itself.\nTogether with several Ipswich teammates, Sivell took part in the 1981 film Escape to Victory, known as just Victory in North America.
