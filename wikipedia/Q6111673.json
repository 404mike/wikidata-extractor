He began his career as a teenager with Tottenham Hotspur but had to wait until after the Second World War to make his debut. He joined Brentford in 1947, where his performances earned him a move to Sheffield United the following year. He appeared for them in the First Division but was unable to prevent relegation at the end of the season, and he joined Plymouth Argyle six months later. Chisholm was soon appointed captain and helped them challenge for promotion to the First Division after returning to the second tier in 1952, as Third Division South champions. Injuries and lifestyle ended his career two years later; he had cartilage removed from both knees and was known to have a drink in a nearby pub before home matches. Nicknamed Jumbo due to his stature, Chisholm was inducted into the Plymouth Argyle Hall of Fame in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Plymouth Argyle F.C. players", "response": ["\"Jack Chisholm profile\"  .
