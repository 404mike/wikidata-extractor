He played several games for Derbyshire in 1945 before first-class cricket was resumed after the war. He remained with Derbyshire in the 1946 season, appearing thrice with little success. During the next 1947 and 1948 seasons he played five times for Worcestershire, and it was here that he recorded his best performances. He made 55 not out against his old club Derbyshire, and took all his three wickets for the county in a single match against Gloucestershire; the most notable of his victims was probably \"one-Test wonder\" George Emmett.\nGenders' last two matches in first-class cricket came for Somerset in the 1949 seasons, but his  scores of 3, 22, 0 and 4 were unimpressive and he never played county cricket again. His 22 came in Somerset's second innings against Cambridge University in June 1949. In this match, all eleven Somerset players (and Extras) reached double figures, but none went on to score a half-century.\nGenders was a right-handed batsman and played 19 innings in ten first-class matches with an average of 16.33 and a top score of 55 not out. He took three first-class wickets with an average of 32.66 and a best performance of 2 for 43.Genders wrote two books about cricket, one a history of Worcestershire County Cricket Club and the other concerning English league cricket. He also wrote a great many books on the subject of gardening.\nGenders died at the age of 72 in Worthing, Sussex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Roy Genders (1949) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ernest Bale", "response": ["Ernest William Bale (18 September 1878 \u2013 6 July 1952) was an English cricketer who played 148 first-class matches between 1904 and 1920, the great majority of these (138) being for Worcestershire, for whom he was the first-choice wicket-keeper for several years before the First World War.

Alan Revill, Eric Marsh,  John Eggar and Roy Genders all began their first-class career during the season, although some had already played for the club in miscellaneous matches during the war. England footballer Raich Carter turned out for Derbyshire at cricket. However newcomers Walter Fullwood and Jack Pearson did not play beyond the end of the season, and John Tomlinson only played one match for the club in 1946."]}, {"page": "Mary McMurtrie", "response": ["With her detailed knowledge of wild flowers she developed her watercolour flower painting beyond a hobby. She always painted directly from life. She did a lot of painting when holidaying in the Algarve, and in Kenya where her daughter lived. McMurtrie exhibited her paintings in local art galleries and eventually became internationally recognised as one of Britain's leading botanical painters. The University of Lisbon commissioned her to illustrate The Flowers of the Algarve, a series of six booklets published between 1973 and 1998. At the request of the author, she painted the illustrations for Roy Genders' 1975 book Growing Old-fashioned Flowers."]}, {"page": "Genders (surname)", "response": ["* Roy Genders (1913\u20131985), English cricketer"]}]}}
