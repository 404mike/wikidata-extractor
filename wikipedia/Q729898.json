Photo courtesy E. Kaufmann, Grindelwald.|Peter Kaufmann with client on the summit of the Wetterhorn (ca. 1906)Generally from the upper middle classes, Kaufmann's clients came from various professions and had different reasons for climbing. Some sought adventure and wanted to prove themselves with a challenging climb or enhance their mountaineering skills; others wanted to experience the beauty and power of nature first-hand; still others were pursuing personal, professional, scientific, or photographic interests. Several prominent clients wrote testimonies into Peter Kaufmann's F\u00fchrerbuch: Frank Vanderstrucken (July 1880), an American composer and conductor; William Woodman Graham (September 1887), Charles Pilkington (July 1877), and Friederick Gardiner (July 1877), accomplished mountain climbers; Arthur Wehrli (September 1899), a Swiss photographer and postcard publisher; Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (July 1891), a political economist; the Lindts (August 1888 & July 1890), chocolatiers and apothecaries from Bern; Archibald Philip Primrose (July 1900), a former Prime Minister of Great Britain; Lionel de Rothschild (July 1900), a banker, politician, and zoologist; W.

Among others, they claimed a near ascent of Dunagiri (reaching about 6,900 m) and an ascent of Changabang (6,864 m, 22,520\u00a0ft) in July in the Garhwal Himalaya. These claims are widely disputed and were probably based on poor maps and a misunderstanding of their location.  However, their ascent to 30 feet below the east summit of Kabru  south of Kangchenjunga in October of that year is now considered quite likely. Before this time, no one is known to have reached over , though it is possible that Incas reached the summit of Aconcagua (6,962 m, 22,841\u00a0ft) in Pre-Columbian times. Kaufmann, Boss and Graham therefore likely broke the world altitude record in mountaineering by 350 m or 550 m and held this record for 26 years, until the Duke of the Abruzzi's expedition to the Karakoram in 1909 reached an altitude of ca. ."]}, {"page": "William Woodman", "response": ["* William Woodman Graham, British mountaineer"]}]}}
