She married her fellow artist John William Waterhouse at the parish church in Ealing, in 1883, and thereafter used the name Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse.  Initially, they lived in a purpose built artistic colony in Primrose Hill, where the houses had studios. In around 1900, they moved to St John's Wood. As well as the Royal Academy, Waterhouse also exhibited her flower paintings with the Royal Society of British Artists in London.\nWaterhouse is buried, along with her husband, at Kensal Green Cemetery and his portrait of her is now owned by Sheffield City Art Galleries.", "link_mentions": {}}}
