She married her fellow artist John William Waterhouse at the parish church in Ealing, in 1883, and thereafter used the name Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse.  Initially, they lived in a purpose built artistic colony in Primrose Hill, where the houses had studios. In around 1900, they moved to St John's Wood. As well as the Royal Academy, Waterhouse also exhibited her flower paintings with the Royal Society of British Artists in London.\nWaterhouse is buried, along with her husband, at Kensal Green Cemetery and his portrait of her is now owned by Sheffield City Art Galleries.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1944 in art", "response": ["* Undated \u2013 Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse, English flower painter (b. 1857)"]}, {"page": "1857 in art", "response": ["* date unknown \u2013 Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse, English flower painter (died 1944)"]}, {"page": "List of Pre-Raphaelite paintings", "response": ["*Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse (c. 1885), Sheffield City Art Galleries, Sheffield"]}, {"page": "List of paintings by John William Waterhouse", "response": ["|100px||Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse |||| Sheffield City Art Galleries, Sheffield||"]}, {"page": "Esther Kenworthy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse"]}, {"page": "Esther (given name)", "response": ["*Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse"]}, {"page": "Kenworthy", "response": ["* Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse (1857\u20131944), British artist"]}, {"page": "Waterhouse (surname)", "response": ["* Esther Kenworthy Waterhouse (1857\u20131944), British artist"]}]}}
