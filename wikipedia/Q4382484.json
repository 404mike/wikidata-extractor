He made a slow start to his Stoke career and by December 1994 he was loaned out to Second Division Hull City where he made seven appearances. He returned to the Victoria Ground in January 1995 and ended the 1994\u201395 season with 28 appearances. Manager Lou Macari used Wallace in a different role in 1995\u201396 playing him alongside Nigel Gleghorn in centre midfield. It worked well as Stoke reached the play-offs where they lost 1\u20130 to Leicester City and Wallace won the player of the year award jointly with goalkeeper Mark Prudhoe. He missed just one match in 1996\u201397 as Stoke finished in a mid-table position of 12th. The 1997\u201398 season saw Stoke play at the new Britannia Stadium but results were poor and relegation to the third tier was suffered. Under Brian Little in 1998\u201399 Wallace was used mainly as a substitute and was released by the club at the end of the season."]}]}}
