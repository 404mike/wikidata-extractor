He worked with British Gas (for five years), the Ancient Monuments Laboratory (English Heritage) and Bradford University Research. In 1983 he became a member of the Institute of Field Archaeologists (CIfA) and is now also an associate editor for the Journal of Archaeological Prospection. In 1986 he founded Geophysical Surveys of Bradford (GSB), an independent consultancy in geophysics for archaeology, which was later acquired by the SUMO Group in 2012.\nOn 21 July 2006, Gater was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science by the University of Bradford for his \"distinguished contributions to the field of Archaeological Geophysics\".On the DVD set The Very Best Time Team Digs, Gater states that, as of the time of the DVD's production, his favourite dig was Turkdean (the only site where the quality of the archaeological data was so good that Time Team returned at a later date to dig it again).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Time Team", "response": [":Stewart Ainsworth, landscape investigator; John Gater and Chris Gaffney, archaeological geophysicists; Henry Chapman, surveyor; and Victor Ambrus, illustrator.", "On 17\u00a0May 2021, Taylor made an announcement on the return of the series, with episodes planned to air for free on the YouTube channel.

GSB Prospection carried out over 2000 projects, including work in Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, England, France, Greece, Northern Ireland, Norway, Scotland, Slovenia, Spain, USA, Wales and Zimbabwe. Among the many significant projects Chris Gaffney undertook at GSB Prospection, the survey at Roman Wroxeter was amongst the most important and involved organising a multinational geophysical team to survey, for the first time, a complete Romano-British town.  During his period at GSB Prospection Gaffney appeared in the Channel 4 archaeological television series, Time Team,. Gaffney retained key linkages with the broader academic community throughout his commercial career and, in 2004, became Editor of Archaeological Prospection.
