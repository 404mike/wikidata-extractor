Although boxing now had its legitimate code of laws, Wales would often be the location of illegal bare-knuckled fights, and there would be known mountainside locations where locals would meet to watch fights.Stead; Williams (2008) p.7 These illegal fights were often conducted at dawn in isolated or remote areas, though they were still sometimes disrupted by the law. To evade criminal proceedings, fights were often arranged on land near county borders where jurisdiction was vague and law enforcement intermittent.Stead; Williams (2008) p.10 In particular the area between Tafarnaubach near Tredegar and Llangynidr in Powys became the 'nursery for would-be champions' due to its proximity to the borders of three counties. Towards the end of the Victorian period several Welsh boxers, who made their name as mountain fighters, began fighting under Queensbury rules and became well known and respected sportsmen. Among their number were champion fighters, John O'Brien, Dai St. John, Redmond Coleman and butcher brothers Sam and Ivor Thomas. By the early 20th century, boxing had not advanced to a great degree in Wales, and many of the country's early professional boxers began their career fighting in booths at fairgrounds. With the popularity of the sport increasing, a scale of weights and titles evolved, which allowed the emergence of working-class local heroes."]}, {"page": "List of Commonwealth Boxing Council champions", "response": ["|align=left |  John O'Brien"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Revie", "response": ["Revie dropped down to featherweight, and won his next six fights, setting up a shot at the British title vacated by Howard Winstone against former British Empire champion John O'Brien. The fight, in March 1969, ended in Revie's favour when the referee stopped it at the end of the fifth round due to injuries to O'Brien's eyes. He was considered a contender for Johnny Famechon's world title, but never got the chance to fight for it. Revie had five non-title fights before his first defence. In October 1969 he beat European champion Tommaso Galli via a points decision, winning by half a point. Despite suffering a cut above his eye in the Galli fight, he followed this with a points win by the same margin over Ecuadorian champion Miguel Herrera 12 days later, which saw him booed out of the ring by an unimpressed crowd at the Royal Albert Hall, and a third half-point win over Algerian Ould Makloufi in November. He suffered his second professional defeat in April 1970 when he was stopped in the second round by Tunisian Tahar Ben Hassen."]}]}}
