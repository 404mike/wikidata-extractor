He made his debut in January 1986 at the age of 27 and scored one of the club's goals against York City. He enjoyed his best season with the club two years later after succeeding Gordon Nisbet as the club's first choice right back, making 47 appearances during the 1987\u201388 season. The emergence of Kenny Brown the following season saw Brimacombe move into midfield, but his appearances in the team became more sporadic. He was released in 1990, having made 113 appearances in all competitions for Argyle. He then returned to part-time football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saltash United F.C.", "response": ["* John Brimacombe"]}, {"page": "John Brimacombe (Australian footballer)", "response": ["John Brimacombe (born 12 July 1953) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Geelong in the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League)."]}, {"page": "Brimacombe, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Brimacombe"]}]}}
