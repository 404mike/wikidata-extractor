He completed the course on his third attempt, during the weekend of 6/7 August 2005, after his first attempt was curtailed by injury and the second by extreme hot weather. Yiannis is among a group of a few who have completed all three major 24-hour rounds in England, Scotland and Wales (Bob Graham Round, Ramsay and Paddy Buckley Round). In addition, he completed his own 24-hour round, the Meirionnydd round in Wales and has also completed the Cuillin round in the Isle of Skye. He has completed a solo run between Snowdon and Pumlumon in Wales, taking in all the major hills in between. Other ultra distance completions include the Joss Naylor challenge in Cumbria, the Leventon line in North Wales and the South Wales Traverse.\nHe was the first member of the Fell Runners Association to have been awarded the long distance trophy twice. He is currently a member of Bowland fellrunners club.In 2003 Yiannis, along with teammate Ray Baines were winners in the veteran section of the Long score class, at the Karrimor International Mountain Marathon (KIMM). In 2007 Yiannis and Ray Baines completed the OMM (previously KIMM) elite class with an aggregate age of 121, the team with the highest aggregate to ever finish the elite class.
