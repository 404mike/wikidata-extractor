Adrian Breen, who was a late addition to the Na Piarsaigh team, stroked home an early goal as well as a point soon after. Kevin Downes contributed a 24th-minute goal when he cut inside and fired a low shot to the left corner. Na Piarsaigh had effectively settled the game as early as the 26th minute when they led by 13 points after outscoring the Ulster champions by 1-09 to 0-01 in a blitzkrieg period. Ruair\u00ed \u00d3g, Cushendall responded with three points in a row including a second of the day from Shane McNaughton who hit four excellent points in total, however, Na Piarsaigh held a solid 2-12 to 0-06 half-time lead. ", "After the interval goal-scorer Breen was on the mark again along with Shane Dowling and Peter Casey. There was a brief reprieve for Cushendall when Neil McManus flicked in a 39th-minute goal from a long Shane McNaughton free. McManus continued to pick off points from frees and finished with that impressive 1-07 tally but the scores simply came easier for Na Piarsaigh who continued to split the posts at their ease and took Karl McKeegan's goal in their stride."]}]}}
