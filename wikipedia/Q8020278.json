He was the son of a clergyman and great nephew of the writer and naturalist, Gilbert White of Selborne.\nAfter a five-year apprenticeship in Leamington Spa he moved to London as an improver in George Gilbert Scott's practice where he remained for two years before setting up his own practice in Truro in 1847. In 1851 he returned to London and worked out of Wimpole Street. His style was close to that of William Butterfield and he built many churches.", "link_mentions": {}}}
