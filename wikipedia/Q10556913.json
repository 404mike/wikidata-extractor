Trailing 2\u20131 after the first leg at Hall Corner, Glapwell travelled as massive underdogs to the second leg against a Matlock Town F.C. side who were two leagues above. Goals from Willie Gamble and Jamie Morgan, though, gave Glapwell a 2\u20131 win to take the tie to extra-time with Glapwell holding their nerve to win the resulting penalty shoot-out 3\u20132. After slowly improving their league position each season, Glapwell were finally promoted to the Premier Division of the Northern Counties East Football League in 1999\u20132000 with a second-placed finish enough to secure Step 5 football for the first time. In 2000\u201301, the club nearly secured a second Derbyshire Senior Cup title but this time they were on the wrong end of the penalty shoot-out after a 5\u20135 draw on aggregate against Glossop North End A.F.C. After five years of consolidation in the league, and with a couple of decent cup runs, a 14-game unbeaten run at the start of the 2007\u201308 season set the club up for a second-placed finish in the Premier Division and winning promotion for the first time to the Northern Premier League Division One South.", "*  Willie Gamble"]}]}}
