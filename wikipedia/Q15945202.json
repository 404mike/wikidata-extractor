Thomson (2008) concludes that the \"assembly\" that sentenced Magnus was either invented or heavily emphasised in order to \"divert some of the blame from Hakon\". Furthermore, in reporting on Earl Haakon's death the saga reports that this was \"felt to be a great loss, his later years having been very peaceful\". Commenting on the complex relationship between history and invention in the saga Joseph Anderson wrote:When great events and mighty deeds were preserved for posterity by oral recitation alone, it was necessary that the memory should be enabled to retain its hold of the elements of the story by some extraneous artistic aid, and therefore they were welded by the wordsmith\u2019s rhymes into a compact and homogenous \u201clay\u201d. Thus, worked into the poetical setting (as the jeweler mounts his gems to enhance their value and ensure their preservation), they passed as heirlooms from generation to generation, floating on the oral tradition of the people\u201d."]}, {"page": "St Vigeans", "response": ["* Joseph Anderson, antiquarian, museum keeper and author (1832-1916), grew up in St Vigeans"]}, {"page": "Joseph Anderson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Joseph Anderson (1757\u20131837) was a U.S. Senator from Tennessee and the first Comptroller of the U.S. Treasury.", "*Joseph Anderson (South Australian politician) (1876\u20131947), accountant, real estate agent and politician in South Australia", "*Joseph Anderson (Commandant) (1790\u20131877), British soldier, penal administrator; politician in colonial Victoria (Australia)", "*Joseph Anderson (U.S. Army general) (born 1959)", "*Joseph Anderson (American football) (born 1988), American football player for the New York Jets", "*Joseph Anderson (antiquarian) (1832\u20131916), Scottish antiquarian, keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland 1870\u20131913, father of the judge Lord St Vingeans", "*Joseph Anderson (Mormon) (1889\u20131992), secretary to the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"]}, {"page": "Warriston Cemetery", "response": ["* Joseph Anderson (antiquarian) (1832\u20131916) keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities, and his son David Anderson, Lord St Vigeans"]}, {"page": "Rhind Lectures", "response": ["\t\tJoseph Anderson", "\t\tJoseph Anderson", "\t\tJoseph Anderson", "\t\tJoseph Anderson", "\t\tJoseph Anderson, LLD., Assistant Secretary and Keeper of the Scottish National Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh"]}, {"page": "Arbroath High School", "response": ["*Joseph Anderson, antiquarian, museum keeper and author (1832\u20131916)"]}, {"page": "Grey Cairns of Camster", "response": ["The first archaeological investigations of the cairns was carried out between 1865\u20136 by Joseph Anderson and Robert Shearer, who investigated a total of seven chambered tombs in Caithness including the two at Camster.Phillips, p. 9 The Camster Round Cairn was investigated in 1865, followed by the Camster Long Cairn in 1866.Masters, p. 126"]}, {"page": "David Anderson, Lord St Vigeans", "response": ["Anderson was born on 26 October 1862.
