He used to say his father was his greatest inspiration and, after his death, apparently felt no reason to continue boxing. However, with his relationship with previous manager Barney Eastwood now at an end, McGuigan returned to the ring between 1988 and 1989, under the management of Frank Warren. He beat former world title challengers Nicky Perez and Francisco Tomas da Cruz, as well as contender Julio C\u00e9sar Miranda, before facing former EBU featherweight champ and future WBC and WBA super featherweight challenger Jim McDonnell. McGuigan lost by TKO when a gash over his right eye, caused by a McDonnell left hook in the second round, forced the referee to stop the fight in the fourth. McGuigan then retired permanently from boxing. His record was 32 wins and 3 losses, with 28 victories by knockout.", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jim McDonnell"]}, {"page": "Azumah Nelson", "response": ["|align=left| Jim McDonnell"]}, {"page": "List of non-professional marathon runners", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"McDonnell\"|Jim McDonnell||sports||boxing||2003||London Marathon ||2:50:54||Athlinks||"]}, {"page": "Brian Mitchell (boxer)", "response": ["Mitchell took on Jose Rivera for the second time in April 1988 in Madrid.
