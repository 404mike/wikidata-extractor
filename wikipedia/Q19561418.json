He was replaced in the New England district by Robert George Massie. By this time, the Border Police were being slowly disbanded with Massie only having four mounted troopers by 1854. Most of his work by this stage was involved in maintaining order at the Rocky River goldfields, with the majority of police work being transferred to Lloyd Bradshaw who was chief constable at Armidale from 1847.", "This district was enacted in 1842 with Henry Robert Oakes being appointed the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Border Police. Oakes was previously commissioner for the Port Macquarie district which became redundant with the formation of the Macleay and Clarence squatting districts. The Macleay District extended from just south of the Macleay River to just south of the Clarence River of coastal New South Wales. Oakes died not long after this appointment and was replaced by Robert George Massie. Massie shifted the headquarters and Border Police barracks from the fledgling town of Kempsey to a place five kilometres further upriver next to a natural ford on the Macleay River. This place was and is known as Belgrave Falls near to the modern-day community of Aldavilla. Massie's initial operations in late 1842 were organising licences in the cedar logging trade and pursuing escaped convicts."]}, {"page": "Sylvester John Browne", "response": [":*Annette Browne ( \u2013 ) married Robert George Massie (1815 - 13 September 1883).
