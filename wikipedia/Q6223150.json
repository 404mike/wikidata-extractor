Bridgeman became rector of Wigan in 1615 and also of Bangor in 1621. Two years before, he had been consecrated Bishop of Chester, a post he held until the abolition of episcopacy in 1646. In 1633 Bridgeman was subject to a royal commission of enquiry led by Thomas Canon following complaints to the privy council that Bridgeman had embezzled fines taken for commuting penances. During his tenure, he initialised suspensions against the puritans Thomas Paget, John Angier and Samuel Eaton. He was deprived of his See by Parliament on 9 October 1646, as episcopacy was abolished for the duration of the Commonwealth and the Protectorate.On 29 April 1606, he married Elizabeth Helyar, daughter of Reverend William Helyar, and had by her five sons.
