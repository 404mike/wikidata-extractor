He was the fourth Bishop and first Archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York, serving between 1842 and his death in 1864. In 1841, he founded St. John's College, which would later become Fordham University.\nA native of Ireland, Hughes was born and raised in the south of County Tyrone. He emigrated to the United States in 1817, and became a priest in 1826 and a bishop in 1838. A figure of national prominence, he exercised great moral and social influence, and presided over a period of explosive growth for Catholicism in New York. He was regarded as \"the best known, if not exactly the best loved, Catholic bishop in the country.\" He became known as \"Dagger John,\" both for his following the Catholic practice wherein a bishop precedes his signature with a cross, as well as for his aggressive personality.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)", "response": ["By the early 1840s, the number of Catholics in the Diocese of New York had increased to 200,000. As a result, several additional dioceses were created in New York state. Most of New York state's Catholics at the time were Irish. The Diocese of New York was made an archdiocese by Pope Pius IX on July 19, 1850. Bishop John Joseph Hughes was raised to the level of archbishop soon afterward. As early as 1850, Hughes determined that the growing Archdiocese of New York needed a large cathedral to replace the older cathedral in Lower Manhattan. At the time, the Fifth Avenue site was still relatively rural. The site faced the gardens of Columbia University to the west, but the surrounding area was otherwise characterized by rocks and unopened streets. Even so, Hughes believed the site would grow into a populous business area.", "* John Joseph Hughes (Archbishop, 1850\u20131864; interred 1883)"]}, {"page": "William Quarter", "response": ["On November 28, 1843, Quarter was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Chicago, Illinois, by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on March 10, 1844 from Bishop John Joseph Hughes, with Bishops Benedict Joseph Fenwick, S.J., and Richard Vincent Whelan serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Accompanied by his brother Walter (who later became vicar general), Quarter arrived in the episcopal see of Chicago on May 5."]}, {"page": "Richard Vincent Whelan", "response": ["On December 19, 1840, Whelan was appointed the second Bishop of Richmond, Virginia, by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on March 21, 1841 from Archbishop Samuel Eccleston, P.S.S., with Bishops Benedict Joseph Fenwick, S.J., and John Joseph Hughes serving as co-consecrators, at Baltimore. The second Catholic bishop in the United States, Bishop Jean Dubois had similarly initially lived in Richmond, but soon moved the seat of his extremely large diocese west (to Bardstown, Kentucky) to serve Catholics in remote mountain areas, as well as to escape anti-Catholic and other civil strife in Virginia's capitol. Furthermore, after the brief American episcopate of his predecessor, the seat had been vacant for more than a decade before Whelan's appointment and consecration, and Richmond had become a stronghold of the Know-Nothing political party, known for its anti-Catholic and racial prejudices and propensity for mob violence."]}]}}
