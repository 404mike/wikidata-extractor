He emigrated to the United States in 1817, and became a priest in 1826 and a bishop in 1838. A figure of national prominence, he exercised great moral and social influence, and presided over a period of explosive growth for Catholicism in New York. He was regarded as \"the best known, if not exactly the best loved, Catholic bishop in the country.\" He became known as \"Dagger John,\" both for his following the Catholic practice wherein a bishop precedes his signature with a cross, as well as for his aggressive personality.", "link_mentions": {}}}
