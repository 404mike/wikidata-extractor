In North Wales, Henry III fortified his positions in lower Gwynedd, and made Deganwy a chartered borough signifying the expansion of royal authority on the Creuddyn peninsula. Additionally, Henry III retained the earldom of Chester reassessing its strategic importance as a royal springboard into Wales.Llywelyn II the Great had developed a close friendship with Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, the most powerful of Marcher lords. Their constant friendship protected the principality\u2019s eastern border. Rannulf\u2019s heir was his nephew John the Scott, who was married to Llywelyn I\u2019s daughter Elen. Their childless marriage and John the Scott\u2019s death left Chester berift of lordship, which led it to fall into the English crown\u2019s possession, according to John Davies, (History of Wales, page 141)Henry III had appointed Alan la Zouche as Justicar of Chester (replacing John de Grey) who pressed the Welsh under his authority with increased taxes, according to Lloyd, while Geoffrey of Langley represented royal authority in the Perfeddwlad In 1254 Henry IIII invested his16-yearold son Prince Edward with all the crown possessions in Wales.In addition to the crown possession in Wales, Edward was also invested with crown possessions in Ireland, Gascony, Cheshire. John Davies wrote, \"Henry III made strenuous efforts to strengthen his hold upon Wales, efforts upon which Edward I would build twenty years later.\"", "Between 1255 and 1256 the people of lower Gwynedd were chafing under the heavy tax burden imposed by Geoffrey of Langley, a royal favorite and lieutenant in the region who sought to extend the English shire system there.According to author Philip Warner, Geoffrey of Langley had become a favorite of King Henry III and his son Prince Edward for his ability to raise money for the often cash-strapped royal treasury. Langley\u2019s tactics included raising taxes and fines in the regions under his administration to extortion levels, and his use of mercenaries as henchmen to enforce his policies. Geoffrey of Langley had become detested in England and in Scotland for his ruthlessness, before his appointment as royal lieutenant in lower Gwynedd, the Perfeddwlad. Warner, Famous Welsh Battles, pg 94Lloyd, J.E., A History of Wales; From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, Barnes & Noble Publishing, Inc. 2004, Career of Llywelyn the Last pgs 241-Davies, John, A History of Wales, Penguin, 1994, From the Treaty of Woodstock to the Battle of Bryn Derwin, pgs 144-170 Prince Edward made a tour of his holdings of Chester as its earl, and then progressed into the Perfeddwlad to inspect his castles of Diserth and Deganwy. After Edward's departure, when it became clear to the Welsh of the region that the English prince was not inclined to intervene on their behalf over Langley's 'tyrannous exactions,\u2019 they rose in revolt and appealed to Llywelyn II for aid. Furthermore, Prince Edward appointed Patrick Chaworth as Steward of Carmarthen, an appointment that \"could hardly be tolerated by Llywelyn who was already bitter and resentful\" over the conditions in lower Gwynedd, whose people appealed for his deliverance. Having reconciled with Dafydd, Llywelyn II released his brother who he thought would be a valuable lieutenant, then gathered an army and crossed the river Conwy.Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg served as one of Llywelyn's lieutenants in the campaign. Maredudd had been ejected from Cantref Mawr in Ystrad Tywi by Rhys Fachan and his English allies. According to Lloyd, From the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, page 242 Within one week Llywelyn II swept eastwards almost as far as Chester itself, stretching Gwynedd's princely domain \"to its old bounds,\" wrote Lloyd. Only the castles at Deganwy and Diserth were left as islets under siege in what was now \"purely Welsh country\" again. Prince Edward and his lieutenant Geoffrey of Langley, who had been in England during the week of Llywelyn's campaign, were powerless to respond as they, and the English crown, lacked any treasury for retaliatory measures against the Welsh prince.Henry III did obtain a loan from his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, but this proved useless. Additionally, Edward did lead a counter-offensive against Llywelyn with a host of Gascons, but after initial successes they were forced to retreat to Chester, according to author Philip Warner. And the English crown was abandoned by yet another ally against Llywelyn, the Marcher lords, who \"sympathized with the insurgents as victims of a common tyranny, and the very barons of the March, hereditary foes of the Welsh, viewed their rebellion with toleration, if not actual friendliness,\" wrote Lloyd. The Marcher lords were suspicious of growing royal authority over the March since the Peace of Woodstock. The inability of the crown to launch any response and the ambivilance so far expressed by other Marcher lords emboldened Llywelyn towards further campaigns. First, he recovered Meirionydd,Llywelyn II expelled Llywelyn ap Maredudd who had only lately inherited Meirionydd from his father recovered for Gwynedd the royal holdings of Lanbadarn and Builth,Llywelyn granted both Llanbadarn and Builth to Maredudd ab Owain as his vassal. then took Gwerthrynion from his cousin Roger II Mortimer. In South and West Wales, Llywelyn ejected Rhys Fychan from the Ystrad Tywi region and restored Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg to both Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychan. Llywelyn held his 1256 Christmas court at Aber, one which was \"certainly not wanting in elements of festivity,\" wrote Lloyd. In January 1257 Llywelyn harassed Powys Fadog, already ravaged from the prior year's campaigns, and then conquered Powys Wynwynwyn as far as Pool, driving out Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn.Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of upper Powys \"Powys Wenwynwyn\" took flight and sought aid from John Lestrange and John fitz Alan, \"who could do nothing, however, but hold Montgomery,\" wrote Lloyd. (Wales from the Norman Invasion to the Edwardian Conquest, page 243) Pushing into Glamorgan, Llywelyn campaigned between the rivers Towy and Tawe where he enlisted the Welsh of the Gower, Kidwelly, and Carnwyllion to his side, thereby undermining the Marcher authority of the barons Patrick Chaworth and William de Braose. A hapless King Henry III sought the aid of his brother Richard, who had just been elected as Holy Roman Emperor, but though Llywelyn II and the emperor exchanged courteous and amicable correspondence, Llywelyn II refused to yield any of his conquests, but agreed to a long truce, one which allow Llywelyn to consolidate his gains. Before Easter 1257, Llywelyn was home in Gwynedd."]}, {"page": "Sir Geoffrey de Langley", "response": ["#Redirect Geoffrey of Langley"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey de Langley", "response": ["#Redirect Geoffrey of Langley"]}, {"page": "Langley (surname)", "response": ["*Geoffrey of Langley (fl. 1270\u20131294), English knight"]}]}}
