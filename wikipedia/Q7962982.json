Firstly there was a topical discussion, followed by music from The Keynotes close harmony group. Then came what Muir termed a gimmick, which might be Hamlet done as a pantomime, or an operatic weather forecast. Finally, after another song from Nichols or Bentley, there was a situation comedy sketch worked up from the clich\u00e9s of a literary or cinematic genre; for example, later TIFH programmes included a sketch about restoration England, with Charles II, Nell Gwyn and the Puritan keeper of the Privy Purse (\"anything TV can do, we can do later\"); or a spoof spy story set on an international sleeper from London to Paris (\"\u2026as I moved through the train I gazed at a handsome film star, slumbering in his compartment, and a thought struck me \u2013 whether you're great or whether you're humble, when you sleep upright you dribble\").

It would be closing time, and Mr Glum would start telling the week's story to the barman as a ruse for obtaining another pint (or two) of brown ale. The story would be about some recent episode in the lives of Ron, Mr Glum's dim son (played by Dick Bentley), and Eth, a plain girl for whom Ron represented her only chance of marriage, played by June Whitfield.
