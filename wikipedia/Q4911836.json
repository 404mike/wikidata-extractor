Two of Lawrence's closest friends, No\u00ebl Coward and Beatrice Lillie, were approached regarding the rights to portray them in the film. While Coward was generally supportive, suggesting only small alterations to his character's dialogue, Lillie had a manager who demanded that she play herself, in addition to numerous script changes that enlarged her role. Wise then asked Fairchild to find the name of another female performer Lawrence had worked with who was already dead. Billie Carleton became the composite character that replaced Lillie in the film. When Lawrence reconnects with her wayward father in the film, he is performing in music halls with a mature woman who joins him when he departs for a job in South Africa. In reality Lawrence's father's girlfriend was a chorus girl not much older than Lawrence, and she remained in the United Kingdom while he went overseas.  On the screen, Lawrence's first husband Jack Roper is roughly her age, whereas in real life his name was Francis Gordon-Howley and he was twenty years her senior. Her upper-class Guardsman boyfriend, actually Capt. Philip Astley, is identified as Sir Tony Spencer on-screen, and the Wall Street financier named Ben Mitchell in the film was really Bert Taylor."]}, {"page": "Malvina Longfellow", "response": ["Longfellow gave evidence to a coroner's inquest in London, England, in January 1919.
