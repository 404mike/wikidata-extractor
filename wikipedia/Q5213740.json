After he lost his leg in an industrial accident, the Midland Railway forced him to take a pay cut.  Angered by this injustice, he joined the Bristol Socialist Society and became an activist in a gasworkers' union, which soon merged into the National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers.\nIn 1892, Irving worked with Herbert V. Mills in an attempt to start a utopian socialist community at Starnthwaite, but this soon disintegrated, and Irving eventually won a legal case against Mills. Instead, he became a socialist lecturer, and then in 1894, secretary of the Burnley branch of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF).\nBurnley was one of the SDF's most important branches, and Irving kept its profile high.  In the 1906 general election, SDF leader H. M. Hyndman stood in the Burnley constituency, and came within 350 votes of winning the seat.  In 1902, Irving was elected to Burnley Town Council, a post he held (with one gap) until 1922.\nIn the 1906 election, Irving himself stood for Accrington; he then stood in the 1908 Manchester North West by-election, and in the January and December 1910 general elections he stood in Rochdale.  While his votes varied considerably, as an SDF candidate he never came close to winning a seat.\nIn 1911, Irving followed the SDF into the formation of the British Socialist Party.  In 1914, he was a supporter of British action in World War I, and as a result, when the SDF split on the issue, he joined Hyndman's new group, the National Socialist Party.  This group affiliated to the Labour Party, and as a Labour candidate he was finally able to win a Parliamentary seat, taking Burnley in the 1918 general election.  He held the seat in 1922 and 1923, but remained a low-profile MP and died in 1924 aged 69.\nIn 1921 Irving gave evidence to the Select Committee on Members' Expenses. He said that it was not possible for him to live on the salary of \u00a3400 that MPs received. He had to keep up his house in Burnley and also pay \u00a3165 for a third-class railway pass. He rented a single room when in London. He spoke of feeling \"a little sense of humiliation\" when in contact with other MPs who did not have to think so carefully about what they spent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Dan Irving", "thumb|120px|Dan Irving", "*British Socialist Party: Dan Irving"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: I", "response": ["*Dan Irving (1918\u20131924)"]}, {"page": "List of physically disabled politicians", "response": ["* Dan Irving, MP 1918\u201324 (lost a leg in an industrial accident as a railway worker)"]}, {"page": "Manchester North West (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Dan Irving:"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Dan Irving"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1923 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Dan Irving"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Dan Irving"]}, {"page": "David Daniel Irving", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dan Irving"]}, {"page": "David Irving (politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dan Irving"]}, {"page": "Katharine Glasier", "response": ["Conway became a teacher at Redland High School in Bristol, where she was inspired to join the Bristol Socialist Society after seeing a demonstration by striking female cotton workers.

The dissidents included Dan Irving, later a Labour MP, and the Bristol socialist and feminist Enid Stacey.
