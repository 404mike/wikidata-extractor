When the supply of ammunition being loaded by Mrs Rice Kent was at its end, Richard attempted to escape but was shot and died from his wounds within several days. Thomas was not charged with armed rebellion but with \"wilful murder\", executed by firing squad and buried in the Detention Barracks. David was transferred to Richmond Barracks in Dublin, where he was sentenced to death, though later was reduced to penal servitude for life. Subsequently, he was moved to HM Prison Pentonville in England though released from there within the year.,.David Kent was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\u00e9in MP for the Cork East constituency at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, though Kent did not attend. He was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Cork East and North East constituency at the 1921 elections. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it.\nHe was re-elected for the same constituency at the 1922 general election, this time as an anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TD, and he did not sit in the D\u00e1il from this time onwards.
