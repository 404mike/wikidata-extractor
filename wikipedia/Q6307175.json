The division was assigned to Lieutenant General Brian Horrock's X Corps, then part of the American Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark and, although unavailable for Sicily, had been selected for participation in the Allied invasion of Italy and commenced intensive training in amphibious warfare.
