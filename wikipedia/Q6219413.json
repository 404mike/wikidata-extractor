His nickname refers to High Carrick, his hill farm on the edge of the Otterburn Army ranges, near Elsdon; Armstrong is a common name in the Borders. He claimed descent from the Border reiver Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie. His wife was descended from Muckle Jock Milburn.\nHe played Northumbrian pipes as a young man, and in later life the fiddle. The Armstrong family claims an unbroken tradition of Northumbrian piping going back at least four generations. The Clough family visited the Armstrong family home at Raylees for several years, just after the First World War, and John often played duets there with Tom Clough.  He also later played regularly with Billy Pigg, who wrote several tunes named for him and his family,  \"The Carrick Hornpipe\", \"Raylees\", \"Mary Armstrong\", \"Jane of Biddlestone\", \"Anne's Wedding\" and \"John of Carrick\". John, with his sister Annie Snaith, and Billy Pigg, played regularly at events in the area, becoming known as 'The Border Minstrels'. They were joined in 1938 by Archie Dagg. They played for listening, rather than dancing.\nJohn owned a notable collection of pipe and fiddle tunes, including early manuscripts of tunes by James Hill, and autograph manuscripts by Robert Whinham. These provided 88 of the 112 tunes for the Charlton Memorial Tune Book. This book was a major extension to the published repertoire of Northumbrian pipe music, being much larger than the first edition of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society Tune Book. \nUnfortunately, late in his life, he lent many of his Whinham manuscripts to a friend, and they were lost.\nA series of accidents to his hands, resulting in a stiffening of his fingers, forced John to concentrate on the fiddle in later years. He started playing duets with Joe Hutton in 1972, adapting arrangement for two pipes to pipes and fiddle. In 1973 they won the pairs competition at Newcastleton Traditional Festival. He is featured on the Topic album Bonny North Tyne.  However  a project for a subsequent duet album never materialised, owing to his illness and death. Some recordings of them are available on FARNE, as well as a few of Armstrong on solo fiddle.FARNE  wrongly attributes some compositions to him, but there are no confirmed attributions of any compositions of his; in particular there are none in the Charlton Memorial Book, based on his own collection, where any compositions by him might be expected. However, the jig \"Coquet Lights\" is widely believed to be by him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*John Armstrong (of Carrick)"]}, {"page": "John Armstrong", "response": ["John Armstrong may refer to:", "*John Armstrong (Australian politician) (1908\u20131977)", "*John Armstrong (New Zealand politician) (1935\u20132018)", "*John Armstrong Jr. (1758\u20131843), soldier and U.S. Secretary of War", "*John Armstrong Sr. (1717\u20131795), American general and Continental Congressman", "*John Armstrong (archbishop of Armagh) (1915\u20131987), Anglican bishop", "*John Armstrong (bishop of Grahamstown) (1813\u20131856), Anglican bishop", "*John Armstrong (bishop of Bermuda) (1905\u20131992), Anglican bishop", "*John Armstrong (priest) (1792\u20131856), Anglican priest in Ireland", "* John Armstrong (cricketer) (born 1981), England", "* John Armstrong (footballer, born 1890) (1890\u20131950), England", "* John Armstrong (footballer, born 1936), Scotland", "* John Armstrong (footballer, born 1987), Scotland", "* John Armstrong (rugby league), Australia", "*John Armstrong (architect) (1857\u20131941), Scotland", "*John Armstrong (artist) (1893\u20131973), UK", "*John Armstrong (British Army officer) (1674\u20131742), Surveyor General", "*John Armstrong (British writer/philosopher) (born 1966)", "*John Armstrong (Carolina) (1735\u20131784), American soldier and land registrar", "*John Armstrong (of Carrick) (1909\u20131984), farmer and musician from Northumberland", "*John Armstrong (comics) (died 2018), British artist", "*John Armstrong (frontiersman) (1755\u20131816), Pennsylvania and Ohio", "*John Armstrong (journalist/poet) (1771\u20131797), Scotland", "*John Armstrong (model railroader) (1920\u20132004), US", "*John Armstrong (physician) (1784\u20131829), England", "*John Armstrong (poet) (1709\u20131779), Scotland", "*John Armstrong (engineer) (1775\u20131854), Britain", "*John Armstrong, New Zealand Army, made calculations for the Te Rata Bridge"]}, {"page": "Robert Whinham", "response": ["Remember Me lists some 60 compositions of his, as well as variation sets by him on traditional tunes, and others attributed to him. They include most of the dance types a dancing master would need, though hornpipes are predominant. Many of his tunes are found in manuscripts belonging to different musicians in Northumberland, notably John Armstrong of Carrick and his sister Annie Snaith.
