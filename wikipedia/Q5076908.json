In the resulting by-election, he was defeated by Francis Meehan, the IPP candidate.\nAfter losing the by-election, Dolan emigrated to St. Louis, Missouri, then a center of shoe manufacture. He hoped to export that technology and set up a shoe factory in Leitrim, but was not successful. He continued to agitate on behalf of an independent Ireland and against the entry of the United States into World War I.\nDolan's marriage to an Episcopalian in 1953 and entry into Freemasonry made him a pariah among the Irish community of St. Louis. He became a law professor and died in 1963, at Incarnate Word Hospital. He was survived by his wife, Gladys Stake Dolan, and daughter, Perry Topping, and a step-daughter, RS Cline.He was the brother of James Dolan, elected Sinn F\u00e9in TD at the 1918 general election for Leitrim.", "link_mentions": {}}}
