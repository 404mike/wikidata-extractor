In the resulting by-election, he was defeated by Francis Meehan, the IPP candidate.\nAfter losing the by-election, Dolan emigrated to St. Louis, Missouri, then a center of shoe manufacture. He hoped to export that technology and set up a shoe factory in Leitrim, but was not successful. He continued to agitate on behalf of an independent Ireland and against the entry of the United States into World War I.\nDolan's marriage to an Episcopalian in 1953 and entry into Freemasonry made him a pariah among the Irish community of St. Louis. He became a law professor and died in 1963, at Incarnate Word Hospital. He was survived by his wife, Gladys Stake Dolan.His brother James Dolan was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in TD at the 1918 general election for Leitrim.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Griffith", "response": ["In February 1908, Sinn F\u00e9in unsuccessfully contested a by-election in North Leitrim, where the sitting MP, one Charles Dolan of Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, had defected to Sinn F\u00e9in.

Cosgrave) and contained a dissident wing grouped from 1910 around the monthly periodical called Irish Freedom. The IRB members argued that the aim of dual monarchism should be replaced by republicanism and that Griffith was excessively inclined to compromise with conservative elements (notably in his pro-employer position during the 1913\u20131914 Dublin Lockout, when he saw the syndicalism of James Larkin as aimed at crippling Irish industry for Great Britain's benefit)."]}, {"page": "James Dolan (Irish politician)", "response": ["He was a brother of Charles Dolan, Irish Parliamentary Party MP for North Leitrim from 1906 to 1908, who resigned his seat to run as the first ever Sinn F\u00e9in parliamentary candidate."]}, {"page": "North Leitrim (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles Dolan"]}, {"page": "Families in the Oireachtas", "response": ["*Charles Dolan (1881\u20131963): IPP MP North Leitrim 1906\u20131908"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1906 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["21 February 1908: North Leitrim \u2013 Francis Meehan (Irish Parliamentary Party) replacing Charles Dolan (Irish Parliamentary Party) who resigned order to re-fight the constituency on behalf of Sinn F\u00e9in."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|Charles Dolan", "|Charles Dolan"]}, {"page": "Charles Joseph Dolan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Dolan (politician)"]}, {"page": "Charles Dolan (British politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Dolan (politician)"]}, {"page": "Charles Dolan", "response": ["The son of an inventor, Dolan was born in Cleveland, Ohio.
