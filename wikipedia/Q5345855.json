He was a right-handed batsman and a slow underarm bowler. He was one of the last cricketers to use this bowling style. Whalley-Tooker played two first-class matches for Hampshire.\nWhalley-Tooker made his first-class debut against the local rivals Sussex in 1883. He made his final appearance for the club during the 1885 County season, once again against Sussex in what was to be the club's final season with first-class status until the 1895 County Championship.\nIn 1908 Whalley-Tooker played for Hambledon against an England XI in a commemorative match at the Broadhalfpenny Down ground, home to the original Hambledon Club. Hambledon won the match by five wickets. This was Whalley-Tooker's final first-class match.\nWhalley-Tooker was a descendant of a member of the original Hambledon club, which gave him a proud link to cricketing history. Following the match in 1908, he had reclaimed the Broadhalfpenny Down ground for farming land. Whalley-Tooker set about the task of securing its use for cricket once again, and in 1925 it was restored to host cricket matches. The possession of the land was given to Winchester College, with the college and Hambledon playing the first match there since its restoration. Whalley-Tooker led the Hambledon side to victory.\nWhalley-Tooker died in Hambledon, Hampshire on 23 November 1940.", "link_mentions": {}}}
