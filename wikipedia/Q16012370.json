He was born in Loughborough, Leicestershire and died at Branksome, Poole, Dorset.\nArmstrong was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an irregular right-arm medium-pace bowler. He came rather late to first-class cricket, playing just a single match in the 1919 season and then not re-appearing until 1926, when he was 33. He then played for the first team regularly right up to the start of the Second World War, when he was 46, and even re-appeared in non-first-class matches played at the end of the war in 1945, when he was 52. Every single one of his 386 first-class games was played for Leicestershire; his period of greatest success came after he was 40 and he was never selected for a representative game of any kind.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Norman Armstrong || 19,001"]}, {"page": "Armstrong (surname)", "response": ["*Norman Armstrong (1892\u20131990), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Haydon Smith", "response": ["In 1924, Leicestershire, to that point one of the weaker first-class cricket counties, decided that a more professional approach was needed for success; the club appointed its first-ever professional coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and entered a second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship for the first time. Smith, Horace Snary and Norman Armstrong were among players who later became prominent who were brought on through this system, and Smith made his first-class debut in the 1925 season. He played in 19 matches in that season but took only 12 wickets. At this stage he was apparently regarded primarily as a batting all-rounder: he hit three scores of more than 50 in the season, though his batting average for 448 runs was only 13.57. Over the next two seasons his figures got worse in terms of number of matches played, batting average and number of wickets taken."]}, {"page": "Horace Snary", "response": ["In 1924, Leicestershire, to that point one of the weaker first-class counties, decided that a more professional approach was needed for success; the club appointed its first-ever professional coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and entered a second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship for the first time. Snary, Haydon Smith and Norman Armstrong were among players who later became prominent who were brought on through this system and in the team's first season in the Minor Counties Snary took 38 wickets at a cost of less than 12 runs per wicket, including a return of five wickets for six runs against Buckinghamshire.

His own performances did not equal those of 1922, but nor did they fall much short: he made at least 500 runs in each season and his season average only once dipped below 15 runs per innings. His only century for Leicestershire was an innings of 104 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1923. In that match and in others until the emergence of Eddie Dawson, Berry and Shipman as regular opening batsmen, Fowke opened the innings, but later he dropped down the batting order to No 6 or No 7, and sometimes even lower. He missed a few matches in 1926 through a leg strain, but otherwise maintained fitness through to the end of the 1927 season, when he played in 29 first-class matches, more than in any other season, and then retired."]}, {"page": "Leslie Ward (cricketer)", "response": ["Ward made his only appearance in first-class cricket when he was selected to play for Warwickshire against Leicestershire at Hinckley. In a drawn match, Ward batted once, scoring 5 runs in Warwickshire's only innings, but was dismissed bowled by Norman Armstrong. He wasn't required to bowl in Leicestershire's first-innings, during which Joseph Mayer and Derek Foster shared nine of the ten wickets to fall as Leicestershire were bowled out for 53 in 23.2 overs.
