In the past she seemed too bullying a presence; she was too stiffly theatrical for the camera and her voice was a blaster. Here, as Mrs. Hargreaves, she has the capacity for wonder of the Alice of the stories, and when she's overtaken by frailty her voice is querulous and fading.\"  \"The bright, poised, subtly flirty Alice at ten [is] played by Amelia Shankley, whose conversations with her sisters have an angelic precision. The sound of these imperious little-princess voices blended in idle chitchat is plangent, evocative. It makes you happy and makes you respond to the happiness of the Reverend Mr. Dodgson as he loiters outside the little girls' windows, eavesdropping... Ian Holm, who plays Dodgson, has to achieve almost all his effects passively, by registering the man's acute and agonizing self-consciousness and his furtive reactions to what goes on around him; it's all there in Holm's performance.\""]}, {"page": "List of fictional princesses", "response": ["* A Little Princess (1986), mini-series starring Amelia Shankley."]}, {"page": "Mother Love (TV series)", "response": ["*Amelia Shankley as Harriet"]}, {"page": "Red Riding Hood (1989 film)", "response": ["The story opens with Linet (Amelia Shankley) chasing something she believes to be an elf fairy.
