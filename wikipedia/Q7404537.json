He also represented Delhi having coming through their youth teams.Oberoi was a Rhodes Scholar and an alumnus of St. Stephen's College, Delhi, where he studied Economics between 2001 and 2004. He completed his schooling from Modern School, Delhi\nIn 2005, Oberoi made 247 against Cambridge at Fenner's in the Varsity Match. This was the third-highest of all time for a side representing Oxford University; the previous two higher scores were both made in the 19th century. It was also the highest ever in a Varsity Match. This record was surpassed in July 2013 when Samridh Agarwal scored 313 not out for Oxford in the fixture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005 English cricket season", "response": ["The fourth NatWest Series match saw normal service resumed, with England beating Bangladesh by 168 runs after the hosts put on 391 for 4, the second-highest score in ODIs. The 2005 Twenty20 Cup started on 22 June, again with large audiences, and with last year's winners, Leicestershire, and runners-up, Surrey, both scoring wins. The fifth ODI allowed Australia back in, with a comfortable 57 win against England. Any anticipation over the next Australia v Bangladesh tie was easily brushed aside by the Aussies, who struck out Bangladesh for 139, and then reached their target in 19 overs without losing a wicket. Bangladesh were eliminated from the Series in the seventh ODI, when England beat them by five wickets. The eighth match should have been a rehearsal for the final, and Australia's 261 for 9 set the stage well. But rain was always expected and the contest was rained off as a \"no result\" with England 37 for 1 off 6 overs in their reply. Bangladesh's tour of England ended with a creditable performance against Australia in the ninth ODI, although their 250 for 8 was ultimately overcome by the Aussie with six wickets and eleven balls left after they had wobbled earlier in the innings. At the same time, the Twenty20 Cup was continuing apace, and Oxford University (610 for 5 declared) beat Cambridge University (129 and 268), with Salil Oberoi's 247 gaining positive comment in his native India."]}, {"page": "Oxford UCCE and Oxford University in 2005", "response": ["Oxford UCCE recorded a thumping victory over Cambridge UCCE in the annual Varsity match between the two universities.
