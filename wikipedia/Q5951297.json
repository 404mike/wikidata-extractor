He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium-pace bowler, who played for Glamorgan.\nHe attended the Sixth Form at Monmouth School, and was ever-present in the School 1st XI cricket team, before making his debut for Glamorgan in 2005.\nHe was named in the England Under-19s' tour of Bangladesh, but had to withdraw his place because of an injury to his wrist. He was subsequently able to return to the squad, thanks to the subsequent withdrawal of Richard Jones from the team.\nWaters went to Australia for the best part of six months playing his professional sport there.\nIn 2012, he topped the first-class batting averages for Glamorgan, with a batting average of 53.00. This was mainly because Waters was not out 12 times out of 14 innings.\nGlamorgan and England had high hopes for the man dubbed \"The next Simon Jones\" for his ability to reverse swing the ball at good pace, but Waters' potential was not realised, as he was forced to retire in August 2014 due to exercise-induced dystonia.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
