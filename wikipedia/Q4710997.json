Each school (e.g., Eton, Harrow and Winchester) had its own variations. Albert Pell, a former Rugby pupil who went to Cambridge University in 1839, began organising football matches there but, because of the different school variations, a compromise set of rules had to be found.Marshall, Howard (1951). Oxford v Cambridge. The Story of the University Rugby Match, page 13. Clarke & Corcoran. By 1843, a set of rules is believed to have been in existence at Eton which allowed handling of the ball to control it, but not running with it in the hand and not passing it by hand. The first known 11\u2013a\u2013side games took place at Eton where the \"dribbling game\" was popular. The written version of Rugby School Football Rules in 1845 allowed the ball to be carried and passed by hand.

After brief incumbencies in Yorkshire and Dorset, he settled in Northamptonshire in 1867 and was successively rector of Haselbech to 1882 and Harlestone until 1907. In both parishes, Bury was involved with the Brixworth Poor Law union and was chairman of the board of guardians. As such, he was a leading figure in the implementation of a harsh local policy of \"retrenchment\" by which the Brixworth union attempted to minimise outdoor relief \u2013 payments made to poor people outside the central workhouse \u2013 eventually developing a series of \"co-operative\" welfare-to-work ventures, including subsistence agricultural work and a co-operative public house in Harlestone. Recent historians have argued that the policy was instigated largely at the insistence of the zealous Albert Pell, Member of Parliament for South Leicestershire and a Haselbech resident, with the connivance of the dominant local landowner and church benefice owner, Earl Spencer; they argue that it forced the rural poor into greater poverty or into migration to nearby towns such as Northampton. Bury was also the author of books on poor law reform that advocated the minimisation of outdoor relief and the establishment of welfare-to-work schemes. In parallel with his Poor Law guardianship, Bury was also chairman of the Brixworth Rural District from its formation as a unit of local government in 1894, though by that stage the dominance of the retrenchment view on the local Poor Law union was being actively challenged through the rise of the agricultural workers' union."]}]}}
