It occurs on sandplain country north of Gingin, Western Australia. Growing to 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) in height, it has long serrated leaves and large, bright flower spikes, initially white before opening to a bright orange, that appear mainly in late summer (February and March). Edmund Gilbert Baker described B. burdettii in 1934, naming it after its collector, W. Burdett.", "Banksia burdettii was described in 1934 by Edmund Gilbert Baker, from a specimen grown from seed collected at Watheroo by one W. Burdett in 1930. Baker felt it had affinities to B. baueri, B. prionotes and B. menziesii, placing it in the series Cyrtostylis. In 1981, Alex George published a revised arrangement that placed B.\u00a0prionotes in the subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Crocinae, a new series of four closely related species, all with bright orange perianths and pistils."]}, {"page": "Brachystegia bakeriana", "response": ["The Latin specific epithet bakeriana is in honor of the English botanist Edmund Gilbert Baker.Hutch. & Burtt Davy, in Bull.

It is now known as Otholobium fruticans. This name was published in the Species Plantarum in 1753, the first work to consistently apply binomial names. Two further species were described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger in 1781. He named them Psoralea rotundifolia and P. stachydis, and these species are now known as Otholobium rotundifolium and O. hirtum. This was followed in 1794 by Jean Louis Marie Poiret who added P. acuminata, P. ononoides and P. sericea, which are currently named O. acuminatum, O. virgatum and O. sericeum respectively. When Carl Thunberg, who visited the Cape from 1772 till 1775, revised Psoralea  in 1823, and therein added P. tomentosa, P. racemosa, P. argentea and P. striata (now O. sericeum, O. racemosum, O. argenteum and O. striatum). Ernst Heinrich Friedrich Meyer described in 1832 Psoralea obliqua (now Otholobium obliquum), P. bracteata var. bracteata (now O. fruticans) and P. bracteata var. brevibracteata (the current O. bracteolatum). In 1836, Psoralea was reviewed by Christian Friedrich Ecklon and Karl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher, who distinguished P. albicans (= O. argenteum), P. algoensis and P. bracteolata (which are considered to be conspecific and are known today as O. bracteolatum), P. candicans (now O. candicans), P. cephalotes and P. stachyerum (both now included in O. stachyerum), P. hilaris (currently O. racemosum), P. polyphylla (now O. polyphyllum), P. rupicola (now included in O. striatum), P. uncinata (now O. uncinatum) and P. venusta (now O. venustum). In the same year Meyer published a revision in which he distinguished P. carnea, P. obliqua, P. parviflora, P. triantha (now known as O. carneum, O. obliquum, O. parviflorum and O. trianthum respectively), P. cephalotes (= O. stachyerum), P. densa (= O. acuminatum), and P. spathulata (= O. mundianum). In Volume II of the Flora Capensis, published in 1862, William Henry Harvey newly described P. bowieana, P. hamata, P. macradenia, P. polysticta and P. thomii (now O. bowieanum, O. hamatum, O. macradenium, O. polysticum, O. thomii). Daniel Oliver described Psoralea foliosa (= O. foliosum) in 1885, while Edmund Gilbert Baker distinguished P. foliosa var. gazense (= O.  subsp. gazense) in 1911. Helena Forbes added in 1930 P. bolusii (= Otholobium bolusii) and P. royffei (included in O. caffrum). Henry Georges Fourcade described P. heterosepalum (= O. heterosepalum) in 1932."]}, {"page": "Banksia ashbyi subsp. boreoscaia", "response": ["Banksia ashbyi was first formally described in 1934 by Edmund Gilbert Baker in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. The specific epithet honours Edwin Ashby, one of the collectors of the type specimens. Subspecies boreoscaia was first formally described in 2008 by Alex George. Although distinct lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous forms of B.\u00a0ashbyi had long been recognised, they were not formally described as taxa until George published the lignotuberous form as B.\u00a0ashbyi subsp. boreoscaia, thus invoking the autonym B.\u00a0ashbyi subsp. ashbyi for the non-lignotuberous form. George noted that although it is not possible to distinguish between the subspecies from the flowers, fruit or foliage, the distinctive differences in habit are retained in cultivation. For the type specimen of B.\u00a0ashbyi subsp. boreoscaia, George chose a specimen collected from Quobba Point by Kevin Francis Kenneally on 15 October 1975. The specific epithet boreoscaia is from the Greek borealis (\"northern\") and skaios (\"west\"), and refers to the fact that this is the only Banksia taxon to occur in the north-west of Western Australia."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (B)", "response": ["* Baker f. \u2013 Edmund Gilbert Baker (1864\u20131949)"]}, {"page": "Baker f.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edmund Gilbert Baker"]}]}}
