The chief engineer of the line's construction, George Christian Darbyshire, reported in November 1856, that drawings and specifications for the wrought iron bridge over the Saltwater River had been sent to England on 25 June 1856, and that the drawings and specifications for the masonry of the bridge were also well advanced.

Higinbotham supervised the surveying and construction of all new Victorian lines (his first projects were lines to Ballarat and Echuca via Bendigo) and championed various rail improvements, including city station locations, construction of Melbourne's Outer Circle Railway, adaptations to permit unbroken rail traffic between Sydney and Melbourne, and, importantly, uniform adherence to a standard gauge of five feet 3 inches across all Victoria railways."]}, {"page": "Robert Watson (engineer)", "response": ["Watson almost immediately joined George Christian Darbyshire, Engineer of Construction, then District Surveyor at Williamstown.

The levels over this road were the first taken deep into the country. The datum was an assumed low-water mark in Hobson's Bay, and the levels for the whole railway system of the colony were reduced to it.Sir Andrew Clarke BiographyLetter to Surveyor General 28 May 1856, p 48, Andrew Clarke's Report on Railways, 1856, Appendix III."]}, {"page": "Surveyor General of Victoria", "response": ["| George Christian Darbyshire || 1857 || Darbyshire was also Chief Engineer of the Victorian Railways in 1856-57 and again 1891-1898"]}, {"page": "Malmsbury Viaduct", "response": ["The design work was then taken over by Captain Andrew Clarke, R.

Clarke clearly influenced the design of the railway in setting the standards for the line.
