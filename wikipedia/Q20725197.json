Amongst his noted pupils was Mary Alment. He also organised the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) exhibition of arts and industries, and served as superintendent at the new women's industrial school at Carrickmacross, County Monaghan. After 1854, following a reduction in staff by the Department of Science and Art, MacManus complained that the school's reputation was being undermined and that he was overworked. However, the department felt that academic standards were suffering due to a decline in MacManus's health, and pressured the RDS into removing him. MacManus circulated a letter with the press dated 26 June 1862 when the RDS threatened to dismiss him unless he resigned. The letter rallied much support from his former students. He was dismissed by the RDS for improper conduct on 11 July 1862, but reinstated him after an apology. He finally was forced to retire on 30 September 1863, with the title of honorary professor of fine arts."]}, {"page": "List of Irish women artists", "response": ["*Mary Alment (1834\u20131908), landscape, portrait artist"]}]}}
