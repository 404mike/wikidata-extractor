Pointing involved setting up a grid of string squares on a wooden frame surrounding the original, and then measuring the position on the grid and the distance between grid and statue of a series of individual points, and then using this information to carve into the block from which the copy is made.  Robert Manuel Cook notes that Ancient Greek copyists seem to have used many fewer points than some later ones, and copies often vary considerably in the composition as well as the finish.Cook, R.M., Greek Art, p. 147, Penguin, 1986 (reprint of 1972), "]}, {"page": "Laurence Professor of Classical Archaeology", "response": ["* Robert Manuel Cook (1962\u20131976)"]}, {"page": "John Manuel Cook", "response": ["His older brother was Robert Manuel Cook, also a noted scholar of antiquity."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2000", "response": ["*Robert Manuel Cook, 91, British classical scholar."]}]}}
