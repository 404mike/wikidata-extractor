He was influential in the development of the early Pilot ACE computer, working with Alan Turing, and later the design and documentation of programming languages such as ALGOL 60 and Ada. He was based at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) located in Teddington, London, for most of his career.Mike Woodger was the eldest of four children. His father was Joseph Henry Woodger (1894\u20131981), a professor of biology at the University of London. He graduated from University College London in 1943 and worked at the Ministry of Supply on military applications for the rest of World War II. In May 1946, he then joined the new Mathematics Division at the National Physical Laboratory located in west London. At NPL, he worked with Alan Turing on the ACE computer design, leading eventually to the Pilot ACE computer after Turing had left NPL, first operational in 1950. He later worked on programming language design, especially ALGOL 60 and Ada.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of computer scientists", "response": ["* Mike Woodger \u2013 Pilot ACE, ALGOL 60, Ada (programming language)"]}, {"page": "Pilot ACE", "response": ["Pilot ACE was built to a cut down version of Turing's full ACE design. After Turing left NPL (in part because he was disillusioned by the lack of progress on building the ACE), James H. Wilkinson took over the project. Donald Davies, Harry Huskey and Mike Woodger were involved with the design. The Pilot ACE ran its first program on 10 May 1950, and was demonstrated to the press in November 1950."]}, {"page": "ALGOL 68", "response": ["* March 1970: Minority report, ALGOL Bulletin AB31.1.1 - signed by Edsger Dijkstra, Fraser Duncan, Jan Garwick, Tony Hoare,  Brian Randell, Gerhard Seegm\u00fcller, Wlad Turski, and  Mike Woodger."]}, {"page": "Christopher Strachey", "response": ["In January 1951, a friend introduced him to Mike Woodger of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The lab had successfully built a reduced version of Alan Turing's Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) the concept of which dated from 1945: the Pilot ACE. In his spare time Strachey developed a program for the game of draughts (also known as \"checkers\"), which he finished a preliminary version in May 1951. The game completely exhausted the Pilot ACE's memory. The draughts program tried to run for the first time on 30 July 1951 at NPL, but was unsuccessful due to program errors. When Strachey heard about the Manchester Mark 1, which had a much bigger memory, he asked his former fellow-student Alan Turing for the manual and transcribed his program into the operation codes of that machine by around October 1951. By the summer of 1952, the program could \"play a complete game of Draughts at a reasonable speed\". While he did not give this game \u2013 which may have been the first video game \u2013 a name, Noah Wardrip-Fruin named it \"M. U. C. Draughts.\""]}]}}
