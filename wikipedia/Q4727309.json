Moffat also expanded the street performance aspect and brought in sponsorship deals, particularly local breweries. In this way, the Fringe ascended to its current position as the largest arts festival in the world. This was a deliberate policy by Moffat, who found it difficult to promote the Fringe on merit given the Society's position of neutrality. Increasing show numbers was therefore a way of attracting more attention. At this point, the Fringe operated on only two full-time members of staff. In 1977, the office moved to a converted shop and basement at 170 High Street.", "The first full-time Fringe chief was John Milligan, who had worked for the Arts Council and been a researcher with BBC Scotland. He left in 1976 to run the Craigmillar Festival, and was succeeded by Alistair Moffat, who had been involved in running the first St Andrews Festival in 1971 and had organised a small festival in his hometown of Kelso in 1972.", "The Fringe is an open access festival. The role of the Fringe Society is solely to facilitate the festival, concentrating mainly on the challenging logistics of organising such a large event.  Alistair Moffat (Fringe administrator 1976\u20131981) summarised the role of the Society when he said, \"As a direct result of the wishes of the participants, the Society had been set up to help the performers that come to Edinburgh and to promote them collectively to the public. It did not come together so that groups could be invited, or in some way artistically vetted. What was performed and how it was done was left entirely to each Fringe group\". This approach is now sometimes referred to as an unjuried festival, open access arts festival or a fringe festival."]}, {"page": "Kelso, Scottish Borders", "response": ["*Alistair Moffat, journalist"]}, {"page": "Caledonia", "response": ["According to Zimmer (2006), Caledonia is derived from the tribal name Caledones (or Cal\u012bdones), which he etymologises as possessing hard feet', alluding to standfastness or endurance\", from the Proto-Celtic roots *kal- \"hard\" and *\u03c6\u0113do- \"foot\".
