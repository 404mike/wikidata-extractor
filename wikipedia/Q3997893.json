The annals make it clear that the Cen\u00e9l Gabra\u00edn lost any earlier monopoly of royal power in the late 7th century and in the 8th, when Cen\u00e9l Loairn kings such as Ferchar Fota, his son Selbach, and grandsons D\u00fangal and Muiredach are found contesting for the kingship of D\u00e1l Riata. The long period of instability in D\u00e1l Riata was only ended by the conquest of the kingdom by \u00d3engus mac Fergusa, king of the Picts, in the 730s.

They can be found in The Chronicles of the Picts and Scots of William Forbes Skene. The chronicle of John of Fordun (14th century) mentions Giric as \"Grim\" or \"Gryme\", reporting him killed by Malcolm II of Scotland. Charles Cawley, a modern genealogist, cautions about the late date of these sources. Giric is not mentioned by earlier sources, which would make his existence questionable. John Bannerman theorised that mac Duib, the Gaelic patronymic of Kenneth III, evolved to the surnames Duff and MacDuff, and that Kenneth III could be a direct ancestor to Clan MacDuff, which produced all Mormaers and Earls of Fife from the 11th to the mid-14th century, noting that Giric could be the actual founder of the house, following a pattern of several Scottish clans seemingly founded by grandsons of their eponym.Bannerman, MacDuff of Fife, p. 22-26, 38"]}, {"page": "D\u00fanchad mac Conaing", "response": ["The death of D\u00fanchad mac Conaing in battle is reported in the Annals of Tigernach in 654: \"... there fell D\u00fanchad, son of Conaing, and Congal, son of Ronan\".A.O.

The Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n also associates \u00c1ed\u00e1n with Leinster. John Bannerman concluded that \"[t]here seems to be no basis of fact behind these traditions.\"Bannerman, pp. 89\u201390 Francis John Byrne suggested that the Echtra was written by a poet at the court of Diarmait mac Ma\u00edl na mB\u00f3, an 11th-century descendant of Brandub, and was written to cement an alliance between Diarmait and the Scots king M\u00e1el Coluim mac Donnchada (\"Malcolm III\"), who claimed to be a descendant of \u00c1ed\u00e1n.Byrne, \"Ireland and her neighbours\", p. 897.
