Rostow, and Jean Fourasti\u00e9. The fusion of sociology with development economics gave the industrial society paradigm strong resemblances to modernization theory, which achieved major influence in social science in the context of postwar decolonization and the development of post-colonial states."]}, {"page": "Richard Stone", "response": ["The young Stone then changed to reading economics. He was interested in economics as he thought that \"if there were more economists, the world would be a better place\". During the Great Slump of the 1930s, the of unemployment was very high and it motivated him to know what caused it and how to overcome it. He faced a challenge from his parents as they were disappointed to his choice. However, Stone was very enthusiastic to be an economist and then enjoyed his time studying economics. At his new major, he got supervision from Richard Kahn and Gerald Shove. However, Stone's quantitative mind had been greatly influenced by Colin Clark, Stone's teacher in statistics at Cambridge. Colin then introduced Stone to his project in measuring the national income. This project then brought the greatest name for Stone as he received Nobel Prize because of this topic. After their meeting at Cambridge, Stone and Clark then became best friends."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Hinton", "response": ["Hinton is the great-great-grandson both of logician George Boole, whose work eventually became one of the foundations of modern computer science, and of surgeon and author James Hinton.The Isaac Newton of logic who was the father of Charles Howard Hinton.

This was made more pressing by the Great Depression and as a basis for Keynesian macroeconomic stabilisation policy and wartime economic planning.

Richard Stone of the U.K. led later contributions during World War II and thereafter. The first formal national accounts were published by the United States in 1947.

The concept of value added is central to national accounting.
