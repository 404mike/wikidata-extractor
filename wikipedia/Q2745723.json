A second element was the settlement project, which, in bringing two distinct ethnic communities into closer proximity, led to an uptick in hostilities that brought about a growing emphasis on the existential threat in both communities.Shmuel Sandler, \u2018Religious Zionism and the State:Political Accommodation and Religious Radicalism in Israel,\u2019 in Bruce Maddy-Waitzman, Efraim Inbar, (eds.)

According to Israel Shahak, Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein stated that the case was different from a Jew murdering other Jews: In this case, non-Jews, who have a different soul from Jewish people, had been murdered, and though some punishment was necessary, it should reflect this distinction.Masalha, p. 125:'Rabbi Likhtenstein, who heads a yeshiva in the occupied territories, voiced his opinion that these Jewish Underground murderers - though they should receive some punishment-should not receive the same penalty meted out to a Jew convicted of murdering another Jew because the soul of a non-Jew had a different value from that of a Jew (Shahak 1988: 3).'"]}, {"page": "Yosef Weitz", "response": ["According to Efraim Karsh, Weitz spoke of establishing a transfer committee, but Ben-Gurion rejected the idea, and no such committee was ever established.\"Benny Morris and the Reign of Error\" http://www.meforum.org/article/466 Nevertheless, Nur MasalhaMasalha, 1992, \"Expulsion of the Palestinians\", p. 188 and Benny MorrisB.
