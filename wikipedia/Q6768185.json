His career began with Oldham Athletic in 1997, and continued with Chesterfield between 2001 and 2005. He spent the final two years of his career playing for Port Vale, before a serious injury he sustained on trial at St Mirren ended his professional playing career. After becoming a qualified tiler he turned out for non-league side Hyde United between 2007 and 2009, before moving on to New Mills for a two-year spell. In 2011, he signed with Mossley, but after just two months of the 2011\u201312 season, he was to return to New Mills.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Innes", "response": ["* Mark Innes (born 1978), footballer"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season started positively with ten points from five games, though until the end of the season Vale failed to find form, and picked up an average of one point a game despite only playing in five draws all season. At half-time at the opening game of the season at Vale Park, fans were surprised to hear an announcement over the public address system telling them not to sing songs deriding rivals Stoke City. Mark Goodlad picked up an injury, allowing Jonny Brain the chance to impress between the sticks. At the end of September, star midfielder Steve Brooker was sold to Bristol City for \u00a3225,000. The club failed to bring in Christian Roberts in return, though Marc Goodfellow was signed on a four-week loan deal the following month. Teenage defender James O'Connor also joined on loan from Aston Villa. In November, Andreas Lipa returned to his homeland to play for Austria Lustenau, after Foyle released the injury-plagued defender. McMahon also left the club to join Leyton Orient. Foyle brought a new signing to Vale Park though, with striker Nathan Lowndes joining on a free transfer from Plymouth Argyle. In December, defender Tyrone Loran joined on a one-month loan from Tranmere Rovers, though returned to Prenton Park when the loan deal was up, after Foyle failed to sign him permanently. Christian Hanson was also signed from non-league Billingham Synthonia. Foyle also signed Nigerian defender George Abbey, who had been released by Macclesfield Town. In January, Dean Smith retired as a player and took up coaching at Leyton Orient. As a replacement, former Vale player Tommy Widdrington joined until the end of the season on non-contract terms. In February, veteran midfielder Danny Sonner joined on a one-month loan from Peterborough United. In March, club legend and former teammate of Foyle, Tony Naylor, joined on an emergency short-term contract, though never took to the field. Tony Dinning also was signed on loan from Bristol City. In addition to this, Mark Innes joined on a free transfer from Chesterfield. Sonner's loan deal was also extended until the end of the season, at which point he was signed permanently, as was Dinning. Vale lost to fellow relegation strugglers Torquay United and Wrexham in the last five games of the season, though a 5\u20130 win over Barnsley ensured the club's safety from the drop.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||27||align=\"left\"| Mark Innes", "| March 2005 || DF ||  || Mark Innes || Chesterfield || Free transfer ||  "]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the season nine players departed the club: Lee Matthews (Crewe Alexandra); Hector Sam (Walsall); Steve Rowland (Southport); Tony Dinning (Stockport County); Micky Cummins (Darlington); Jonny Brain (Macclesfield Town); Mark Innes (Hyde United); Sean Doherty (Accrington Stanley); and Craig James (Darlington).
