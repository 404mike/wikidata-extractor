Over the following months Sabina was encouraged to develop this into a full-length text, and to provide a Czech translation. According to Smetana's biographer Brian Large, this process was prolonged and untidy; the manuscript shows amendments and additions in Smetana's own hand, and some pages apparently written by Smetana's wife Bettina (who may have been receiving dictation). By the end of 1863 a two-act version, with around 20\u00a0musical numbers separated by spoken dialogue, had been assembled. Smetana's diary indicates that he, rather than Sabina, chose the work's title because \"the poet did not know what to call it.\" The translation \"Sold Bride\" is strictly accurate, but the more euphonious \"Bartered Bride\" has been adopted throughout the English-speaking world. Sabina evidently did not fully appreciate Smetana's intention to write a full-length opera, later commenting: \"If I had suspected what Smetana would make of my operetta, I should have taken more pains and written him a better and more solid libretto.\"", "The mood of the entire opera is set by the overture, a concert piece in its own right, which Tyrrell describes as \"a tour de force of the genre, wonderfully spirited & wonderfully crafted.\" Tyrrell draws attention to several of its striking features \u2013 its extended string fugato, climactic tutti and prominent syncopations. The overture does not contain many of the opera's later themes: biographer Brian Large compares it to Mozart's overtures to The Marriage of Figaro and The Magic Flute, in establishing a general mood. It is followed immediately by an extended orchestral prelude, for which Smetana adapted part of his 1849 piano work Wedding Scenes, adding special effects such as bagpipe imitations."]}, {"page": "Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video", "response": ["| Vladimir Horowitz; Brian Large, director", "For the 30th Grammy Awards (1988), Best Performance Music Video nominees included Anthony Eaton for producing The Prince's Trust All-Star Rock Concert (a recording of a benefit concert for The Prince's Trust), Russian American pianist Vladimir Horowitz for Horowitz in Moscow, Cyndi Lauper for Cyndi Lauper in Paris, Bobby McFerrin for Spontaneous Inventions, and Barbra Streisand for One Voice.
