After a year with The Pilgrims he was signed by Grimsby Town where\nhe remained for three seasons before being released in 2010. He briefly joined York City before moving on to Gainsborough Trinity. He signed with Guiseley in August 2011 and played for the club until December 2012 when he emigrated to Thailand to become a football coach at an academy. He then played in Scotland for Broughty Athletic, Arbroath and Montrose.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robbie Stockdale", "response": ["Stockdale signed a two-year deal with Grimsby Town under Alan Buckley in June 2008 and was the first new signing for The Mariners in for the 2008\u20132009 campaign. He made his debut on 19 July in a pre-season friendly against Oldham Athletic at Blundell Park, and went on to score his first goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Morecambe in the FA Cup. By this time Grimsby were under new stewardship following the sacking of Buckley in September 2008, with the club bringing in Mike Newell as his replacement. Following an injury spell in mid season, Stockdale remained on the sidelines for several months while his position was covered by Jamie Clarke. He managed a return to the first team in the closing months of the season and cemented his place at right back, eventually helping The Mariners stave off the threat of relegation from the Football League. During the 2009\u20132010 season Stockdale suffered a hernia injury that kept him sidelined again for several months and would only see him compete 9 times during that season in which right sided attacking midfielder Peter Bore was deployed as the club's first choice right back which would eventually see him be awarded the \"Fans Player of the Season\". Grimsby suffered relegation from the Football League in May 2010 and a month later Stockdale signed a new contract to keep him at Blundell Park for a further season but in the contract was the introduction of Stockdale as the new youth team manager as well as continuing to make himself available for selection as a player. Grimsby manager Neil Woods handed Stockdale the number 39 shirt for the 2010\u20132011 Conference National season as cover for Bore and Bradley Wood. On 18 January 2011 Stockdale played his first competitive match in 18 months when he was called upon to start in the 2\u20131 home win over Kettering Town, the game would be his final competitive match."]}, {"page": "Matthew Heywood", "response": ["On 25 June 2008, Heywood turned down a fresh contract at Griffin Park, and signed a two-year contract with Grimsby Town. He was named Grimsby's club captain for the 2008\u201309 season by his new manager Alan Buckley, but the Mariners began to struggle in the league, and Buckley was dismissed early on into the new campaign. Following increasingly worrying poor performances from Heywood, Buckley's replacement as manager, Mike Newell opted to re-sign former Grimsby centre back Rob Atkinson to replace Matt in defence. The club captaincy was also given to youngster Ryan Bennett. Heywood would only make 18 appearances for Grimsby in his first season and spent a good chunk of that sat on the substitutes bench. During the 2009\u201310 season, Heywood continued to struggle in the sense of finding any way into the first-team, and failed to even make the bench on a regular basis, even under the club's new manager Neil Woods. On 13 January 2010, Woods told Heywood, along with Danny Boshell, Barry Conlon and Jamie Clarke that they were free to leave the club in the January transfer window, this following Heywood only featuring once in the season, playing in a 4\u20130 away defeat against Port Vale in September 2009. On 1 February 2010, Heywood along with Clarke and Boshell were released from the club."]}, {"page": "Jamie Clarke", "response": ["Jamie Clarke may refer to:", "* Jamie Clarke (adventurer) (born 1968), Canadian adventurer and author", "* Jamie Clarke (footballer, born 1982), English footballer for Guiseley", "* Jamie Clarke (footballer, born 1988), English footballer for Lincoln City", "* Jamie Clarke (snooker player) (born 1994), Welsh snooker player", "* Jamie Clarke (Neighbours), a character on Australian soap opera Neighbours"]}, {"page": "Javan Vidal", "response": ["He signed on a one-month loan at League Two side Grimsby Town in September 2008.
