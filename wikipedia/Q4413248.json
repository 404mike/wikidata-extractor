Certain recurring characters achieved a great deal of popularity, particularly the extended Giles family, which first appeared in a published cartoon on 5 August 1945 and featured prominently in the strip. Of these, the most remembered  is the enigmatic matriarch of the family, known simply as Grandma. \nAnother recurring favourite was Chalkie, the tyrannical school teacher who Giles claimed was modelled on one of his childhood teachers, and Larry, the mop-haired child from next door, often seen with a camera.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cartoonists", "response": ["* Carl Giles", "* Carl Giles (Giles), Daily Express"]}, {"page": "Gorillaz", "response": ["Gorillaz\u2019 main musical influences include Massive Attack, the Specials, Big Audio Dynamite, Public Image Ltd, Tom Tom Club, Fun Boy Three, Unkle, A Tribe Called Quest, and De La Soul, as well as The Human League, The Kinks, XTC, Simple Minds, Sonic Youth, Pavement, Beck, Wire, Fela Kuti, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth Wind and Fire, Augustus Pablo, Zapp, and DJ Kool Herc.

"]}, {"page": "History of the National Health Service", "response": ["Cartoons were also used to criticise NHS policy.  From 1948, Zeitlyn also found cartoons portraying concern about the 'bureaucratic consequences' of the NHS. The number of critical cartoons about NHS policy increased from the 1960s, as the NHS faced cuts, and the satire movement emerged in Britain.  In December 1960, cartoonist Victor Weisz drew an image for the Evening Standard showing Minister for Health Enoch Powell as a surgeon covered in blood, accusing him of making too many cuts.  Other cartoonists suggested that too much was being spent on the NHS.  For example, in the Daily Mail in 1968, John Musgrave-Wood drew a man to portray the NHS, who was wearing a dunce's cap and being fed 'Defence Cuts'.  Many cartoons have been very interested in portraying NHS staff, both their lives and industrial conflict.  The cartoonist Carl Giles, who often drew for the Daily Express, was very interested in drawing nurses in particular.  Historian Jack Saunders has argued that Giles' presentation shifted from presenting nurses from 'caring and sexualised' to 'bolshie and assertive'.  Giles sent a cartoon of nurses stealing peas from patients directly to the East Suffolk Nurses League.  On the cartoon, Giles wrote 'with deepest sympathy', referring to the cutting of food allowances."]}, {"page": "Men Only", "response": ["Humour was at the heart of the title, though from the start it carried fiction (including by P.
