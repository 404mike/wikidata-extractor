Throughout the 1980s, Thomas maintained a rotating trio dubbed the Accordion Club, which at various times included John Kirkpatrick, Chris Cutler, Garo Yellin, and Ira Kaplan. While these groupings tended to share a repertoire with Pere Ubu, the focus was smaller. Thomas stated: \"I often use the same songs in both projects ... I can explore the stories behind the songs. I can extend/expand/interpolate those stories.\" Though the Accordion Club never recorded any albums, two songs appeared on R\u0113 Records Quarterly Vol.2 No.1, and it led to the formation of Thomas's current \"solo\" project, the Two Pale Boys. Devoted to \"spontaneous song generation\", they feature Keith Molin\u00e9 on guitar and Andy Diagram on \"trumpet through electronics;\" both make frequent use of MIDI, giving them a broader tonal palette than might be expected from two instruments.
