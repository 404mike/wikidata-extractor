Known for works including Medi\u00e6val Socialism and The Emperor Charles IV, Jarrett also founded Blackfriars Priory at the University of Oxford in 1921, formally reinstating the Dominican Order at that university for the first time since the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christian views on slavery", "response": ["During the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas taught that, although the subjection of one person to another (servitus) was not part of the primary intention of the natural law,  it was appropriate and socially useful in a world impaired by original sin. According to John Francis Maxwell:  Fr. Bede Jarrett, O.P. asserts that Aquinas considered slavery to be a result of sin and was justifiable for that reason. Conversely, Rodney Stark, a sociologist of religion, states that \"Saint Thomas Aquinas deduced that slavery was a sin, and a series of popes upheld his position, beginning in 1435...\""]}, {"page": "List of Old Stonyhursts", "response": ["*Dom Bede Jarrett, Provincial of the Dominican Order"]}, {"page": "Rossiter W. Raymond", "response": ["HOWEVER, crediting Mr. Raymond as the author of this quote appears to be an error, because the quote \"Life is eternal, and love is immortal, and death is only an horizon, and an horizon is nothing save the limit of our site\" was written almost 200 years before Rossiter Raymond was born.  These words, and many others in Raymond's poem \"Death is Only an Horizon\" are first recorded in a prayer written by William Penn (1644-1718).  This prayer is cited in the NSW Council of Churches Selected Christian Prayers, PR0061.  Fr. Bede Jarrett, O.P. also lists this prayer as a prayer of his, but he credits \"prayer written by William Penn, 1644-1718\".  The prayer written by William Penn and documented by the two places listed is as follows:  \" We give them back to thee, dear Lord, who gavest them to us.  Yet as thou didst not lose them in giving, so we have not lost them by their return.  What thou gavest thou takest not away, O Lover of souls; for what is thine is ours also if we are thine. And life is eternal and love is immortal, and death is only an horizon, and an horizon is nothing save the limit of our sight. Lift us up, strong Son of God, that we may see further; cleanse our eyes that we may see more clearly; and draw us closer to thyself that we may know ourselves to be nearer to our loved ones who are with thee.  And while thou dost prepare for us, prepare us also for that happy place, that where they are and thou art, we too may be for evermore.\"It appears that many of the lines of this prayer are included in Raymond's poem \"Death is Only an Horizon.\" In contrast, other than references on the internet, no definitive work or reference by Raymond has come to light that includes his version of the poem."]}, {"page": "The Lives of the Brethren", "response": ["The Lives of the Brethren was written between about 1255 to 1260 by Gerard de Frachet.
