The New Generation movement flowered in the 1990s and early 2000s, producing poets such as Don Paterson, Julia Copus, John Stammers, Jacob Polley, David Morley and Alice Oswald.  A new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the Revival grouping, notably Caroline Bergvall, Tony Lopez, Allen Fisher and Denise Riley.Don Paterson, \"The Dark Art of Poetry\": T.S. Eliot Lecture, 9 November 2004: \"Geniune talents such as, say, Tony Lopez and Denise Riley, working recognisably within the English and European lyric traditions, are drowned by the chorus of articulate but fundamentally talentless poet-commentators\". Major independent and experimental poetry pamphlet publishers include Barque, Flarestack, Knives, Forks and Spoons Press, Penned in the Margins, Heaventree (founded in 2002 but no longer publishing) and Perdika Press.British Poetry Magazines 1914-2000: A History and Bibliography of \"Little Magazines\", David Miller and Richard Price (British Library UK & Oak Knoll Press USA, 2006). Throughout this period, publishing initiatives such as Salt Publishing and Shearsman Books promoted poetic diversity, while independent poetry presses such as Cinnamon press and Enitharmon Press have made available original work from (among others) Dannie Abse, Martyn Crucefix, Jane Duran, U.

Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. Scottish play writing became increasingly internationalised, with Scottish writers such as Liz Lochhead and Edwin Morgan adapting classic texts, while Jo Clifford and David Greig investigated European themes.J. MacDonald, \"Theatre in Scotland\" in B. Kershaw and P. Thomson, The Cambridge History of British Theatre: Volume 3 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), , p. 223. This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Kathleen Jamie, Douglas Dunn, Robert Crawford, and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post."]}, {"page": "Griffin Poetry Prize", "response": ["*Kathleen Jamie, Mr And Mrs Scotland are Dead: Poems 1980-1994", "*Kathleen Jamie"]}, {"page": "North Rona", "response": ["In \"Island at the edge of the world\", the poet Kathleen Jamie describes a visit to the island,Island at the edge of the world as well as in an essay in her collection Sightlines."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Kathleen Jamie FRSE"]}, {"page": "New Generation poets (1994)", "response": ["*Kathleen Jamie "]}, {"page": "Penguin Modern Poets", "response": ["#John Burnside, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie", "#Kathleen Jamie, Don Paterson, Nick Laird (Other Ways to Leave the Room, 2017)"]}, {"page": "Somerset Maugham Award", "response": ["* Kathleen Jamie for The Queen of Sheba"]}, {"page": "Joby Talbot", "response": ["In 2002, Talbot wrote The Wishing Tree, a short a cappella madrigal setting a text by Kathleen Jamie, for The King's Singers, commissioned by the ensemble and The Proms as part of the Queen's Golden Jubilee.

Before Kay was appointed, it was suggested that the role might now only be referred to as the National Poet for Scotland, because of concerns that the word makar had to be explained outside of Scotland. Kay states that she argued for retaining the Makar name, which is still used.
