During a six-week break at Leamington Spa to undergo Dr Jephson's (1798\u20131878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fable The King of the Golden River (not published until December 1850 (but imprinted 1851), with illustrations by Richard Doyle). A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.James S. Dearden, \"The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study\" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32\u201359. Back at Oxford, in 1842 Ruskin sat for a pass degree, and was awarded an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.Bradley, Alexander. \u201cRuskin at Oxford: Pupil and Master\u201d, p. 750, Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900 32, no. 4 (1992): 747\u201364. doi", "===Marriage to Effie Gray===", "During 1847, Ruskin became closer to Effie Gray, the daughter of family friends. It was for her that Ruskin had written The King of the Golden River. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in Perth, once the residence of the Ruskin family. It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin's grandfather). Owing to this association and other complications, Ruskin's parents did not attend. The European Revolutions of 1848 meant that the newlyweds' earliest travels together were restricted, but they were able to visit Normandy, where Ruskin admired the Gothic architecture.", "The marriage was unhappy, with Ruskin reportedly being cruel to Effie and distrustful of her. The marriage was never consummated and was annulled six years later in 1854.For the wider context, see Robert Brownell, A Marriage of Inconvenience: John Ruskin, Effie Gray, John Everett Millais and the surprising truth about the most notorious marriage of the nineteenth century (Pallas Athene, 2013).", "In April 1854, Effie filed her suit of nullity, on grounds of \"non-consummation\" owing to his \"incurable impotency\",Mary Lutyens, Millais and the Ruskins (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.Sir William James, The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais, 1946, p. 237 a charge Ruskin later disputed.Phyllis Rose, Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages, 1983, p. 87 Ruskin wrote, \"I can prove my virility at once.\"Mary Lutyens, Millais and the Ruskins (John Murray, 1968) p. 192. The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of enduring speculation and debate.", "Ruskin's sexuality has been the subject of a great deal of speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to Effie Gray, was annulled after six years owing to non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that Ruskin found her \"person\" repugnant:    He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].  Ruskin told his lawyer during the annulment proceedings:   It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.Mary Lutyens, Millais and the Ruskins, p. 191 The cause of Ruskin's \"disgust\" has led to much conjecture. Mary Lutyens speculated that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of nudes which lacked pubic hair.Lutyens, M., Millais and the Ruskins, p. 156 However, Peter Fuller wrote, \"It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood.\"Peter Fuller, Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace (Chatto & Windus, 1988), pp. 11\u201312 Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also took the view that menstruation was the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. There is no evidence to support any of these theories. William Ewart Gladstone said to his daughter Mary, \"should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin [for the breakdown of the marriage], remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.\"Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen & Unwin, 1950), p. 53.
