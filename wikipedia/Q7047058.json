In the absence of a battlefleet, the submarines would be the primary offensive weapon against the Japanese. As such, the replacement \"Repeat P\" class had to have a similar endurance but be easier to maintain, as well as appreciably smaller in expectation of future treaty restrictions. In drawing up the future requirements for the British submarine fleet, 20 of these new submarines were estimated to be required for a total tonnage of 20,000 tons. Rear Admiral (Submarines), Rear Admiral Noel Laurence, one of the most distinguished British submariners of World War I, also pushed for a strong torpedo armament. He was convinced that a British submarine facing a powerful Japanese surface force would have difficulty penetrating the destroyer screen, and only a large torpedo salvo would be able to ensure the required hits at longer ranges, if necessary using only ASDIC data for a firing solution."]}, {"page": "British submarine flotilla in the Baltic", "response": ["Among the officers were future Admirals and commanders of the British Submarine Service, Sir Noel Laurence and Sir Max Horton and Vice Admiral Leslie Ashmore.

Shortly after 09:00 on 17 October, the British submarine , commanded by Noel Laurence, attempted to torpedo Victoria Louise at a range of . The torpedo ran too deep, however, and missed. Shortly thereafter, the naval command decided that the very weak armor protection of the Victoria Louise-class ships precluded further activity, and the unit was disbanded on 28 October.

On the 7th, she was decommissioned."]}, {"page": "Action of 19 August 1916", "response": ["This was the last occasion on which the German fleet travelled so far west into the North Sea. On 6 October, the German government resumed attacks against merchant vessels by submarine, which meant the U-boat fleet was no longer available for combined attacks against surface vessels. From 18 to 19 October, Scheer led a brief sortie into the North Sea which British intelligence gave advance warning; the Grand Fleet declined to prepare an ambush, staying in port with steam raised, ready to sail. The German sortie was abandoned after a few hours when  was hit by a torpedo fired by  (Lieutenant-Commander J. de B. Jessop) and it was feared other submarines might be in the area. Scheer suffered further difficulties when in November he sailed with Moltke and a division of dreadnoughts to rescue  and , which had been stranded, on the Danish coast. British submarine  (Commander Noel Laurence) managed to hit the battleships  and . The failure of these operations reinforced the belief, created at Jutland, that the risks were too great for such tactics, because of the danger from submarines and mines."]}, {"page": "Commodore Submarine Service", "response": ["*Rear-Admiral Noel Laurence (1932\u20131934)"]}]}}
