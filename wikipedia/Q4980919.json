He is the head chef and sole proprietor of Odette's Restaurant, Primrose Hill, London. He shot to fame as merely a sous chef in 2006 by beating established and well-known chefs to cook the fish course for the Queen's 80th birthday celebrations on the television programme Great British Menu. He is now widely regarded as one of Wales' best chefs and one of Britain's new crop of \"celebrity\" chefs. In June 2015 he opened his new bistro, Bryn@Porth Eirias, on the sea shore in the north Wales town of Colwyn Bay. In 2018 he married Sharleen Spiteri, the frontwoman of Scottish band Texas (band), and the pair have become something of a celebrity couple in their own right. In 2021, they appeared on motoring podcast Fuelling Around to discuss their love of cars as well as their successful careers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Bryn Williams (born 1977), chef"]}, {"page": "Denbigh", "response": ["*Bryn Williams, TV chef who won the Great British Menu BBC TV programme."]}, {"page": "Bara brith", "response": ["A decrease in its popularity led to supermarket Morrisons removing it from their shelves in 2006, and a year later a survey showed that 36% of teenagers in Wales had never tried it.

One of the most traditional foods coming out of the Chubut valleys, it was brought by the Welsh settlers who started arriving in the country in 1865. Other variations exist within Wales. Lyne-Pirkis' version of the bara brith on The Great British Bake Off substituted a tea oil to replace the overnight soaking process for the fruit. In E. Smith Twiddy's The Little Welsh Cookbook, a cup of cold tea is included in the mixture, and marmalade is used as a glaze. Celebrity chef Bryn Williams uses lard in his recipe, and a combination of raisins and candied peel as the mixed fruit."]}, {"page": "Sharleen Spiteri", "response": ["Spiteri married celebrity chef Bryn Williams in September 2018 at the 15th-century church of St. Tyrnog in Llandyrnog, North Wales.
