Major works credited to him include Kuala Lumpur railway station, Ubudiah Mosque, Jamek Mosque, National Textile Museum, Panggung Bandaraya DBKL, Ipoh railway station, and Kowloon railway station.\nAfter an English training in Liverpool, he arrived in Malaya in 1895, and by 1900 was appointed chief government architect of the British-run Federated Malay States, returning to Britain in 1914 at the start of World War I, though he did not officially resign until 1917. Reversing the pattern of many British architects of the British Raj in India, he was an architect who became a soldier, commanding troops in France, and remaining in the army until his retirement in 1924.\nHe was active in sports, especially football and cricket. Hubback was promoted to brigadier general during his service in the British Army.", "link_mentions": {}}}
