Born in the Rhondda Valleys where he remained for most his life, his books reflect the working class of the industrial valleys though his vision is more optimistic and there is less concern for politics and religion which was expressed by many of his contemporaries.\nAlthough largely overlooked during his lifetime, Berry has been embraced by contemporary Welsh authors including Rachel Trezise and Niall Griffiths, and also by contemporary researchers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Welsh literature in English", "response": ["The problems of post-industrial South Wales of the 1960s and 1970s is the subject for novelists such as Alun Richards (1929\u20132004) and Ron Berry (1920\u201397). Both use humour in their bitter description of the spiritual decay of the South Wales Valleys, where the heavy industries of iron and steel and coal have disappeared, to be replaced by high-technology industrial parks. Similar themes are angrily expressed in the novels of a younger generation, as in Christopher Meredith's (born 1954) Shifts (1988), which deals with the closing of a steel mill, and Duncan Bush's (born 1946) grim portrait of urban isolation Glass Shot (1991).Pocket Guide p. 135."]}, {"page": "Rhondda", "response": ["Of the Cadwgan Circle, the most notable is Rhydwen Williams, winner of the Eisteddfod Crown on two occasions, who used the landscape of the industrial valleys as a basis for much of his work.

Berry, who wrote from the viewpoint of the industrial working class, but in a more earthy and centred style then many of his more celebrated peers, \"spoke\" to Griffiths who was captured by the language and style of the writing. In future years Griffiths continued to cite Berry as a major influence, along with writers Alexander Trocchi and Hubert Selby Jr. In 1976 his family emigrated to Australia, but returned three years later after his mother became homesick."]}, {"page": "1996 in Wales", "response": ["*Ron Berry - This Bygone"]}, {"page": "1970 in Wales", "response": ["*Ron Berry \u2013 So Long, Hector Bebb"]}, {"page": "1920 in Wales", "response": ["*23 February \u2013 Ron Berry, writer (d. 1997)"]}, {"page": "Parthian Books", "response": ["*Flame and Slag, Ron Berry", "*So Long, Hector Bebb, Ron Berry"]}, {"page": "Berry (surname)", "response": ["*Ron Berry (1920\u20131997), Welsh writer"]}, {"page": "Ronald Berry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ron Berry"]}, {"page": "Ronald Anthony Berry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ron Berry"]}, {"page": "Ron Anthony Berry", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ron Berry"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 1997", "response": ["*Ron Berry, 77, Welsh author and novelist."]}]}}
