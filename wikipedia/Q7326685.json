As well, many Canadian musicians and bands have been able to play in US towns, particularly Canadians who live near US cities close to the border, such as Detroit and Chicago. These two elements have given Canadian blues musicians a substantial opportunity to be directly influenced by US artists. Canadian blues is based on the major US blues styles, such as Chicago Blues and Mississippi Blues. The proximity of the two countries also facilitates collaborative projects featuring artists from both countries. For example, the Canadian bluesman JW-Jones had his third album, My Kind Of Evil (2004), produced by the US artist Kim Wilson (singer and harmonica player for The Fabulous Thunderbirds), and subsequent albums included collaborations with US saxophonist David \"Fathead\" Newman and US blues artists such as Little Charlie Baty, Junior Watson, Richard Innes, and Larry Taylor. Canadian harp player and band leader David Rotundo has visited many of the key US blues regions, which greatly influenced his musical development.", "JW-Jones is a blues guitarist, singer, and bandleader born in 1980 who was signed to the Canadian NorthernBlues Music label. His band, the JW-Jones Blues Band has recorded five albums. Known as \"Canada's Top Touring Blues Act\" due to the number of performances per year, he has played at blues festivals and clubs in 13 countries and four continents including Canada, US, Europe, Australia, and Brazil. His band's third album, My Kind Of Evil (2004), was produced by multi-Grammy nominee Kim Wilson (singer for The Fabulous Thunderbirds), and features fellow Canadian singer Colin James on two tracks. In 2006, the band had their fourth release with NorthernBlues Music, Kissing in 29 Days, featuring saxophonist David \"Fathead\" Newman (who played with Ray Charles' band for 12 years).  The 2008 album Bluelisted included as guests the guitarist Little Charlie Baty and Junior Watson, drummer Richard Innes and upright bass player Larry Taylor (former bassist with Canned Heat and bassist on many Tom Waits albums).
