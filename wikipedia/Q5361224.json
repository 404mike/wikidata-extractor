The special reserve battalion of the Leicestershire Regiment was sent to man coastal defences near Hull, while all five territorial units were sent to the front. Among them was the city's former Member of Parliament (MP), Eliot Crawshay-Williams, who served in the Middle East with the 1st Leicestershire Royal Horse Artillery.Richardson, pp. 14\u201316. Recruitment to the army was lower in Leicester than in other English industrial towns, partly because of low unemployment in the area\u2014the town's major industries were textile and footwear manufacturing, both of which were necessary for the war effort.Richardson, p. 21. Later in the war, many of the town's factories were given over to munitions production; Leicester produced the first batch of howitzer shells by a British company which was not making ammunition before the war.Richardson, p. 63.
