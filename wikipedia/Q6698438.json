She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity.\""]}, {"page": "Usher (musician)", "response": ["Usher's music is generally R&B, but also incorporates pop among other genres. Elias Leight of Rolling Stone wrote that \"catching pop's waves has always been one of Usher's greatest strengths, whether that means collaborating with Lil Jon when crunk was going mainstream or charging into EDM\". Complex stated that Usher provided some of \"the best of pop music in R&B\". His narratives have an autobiographical nature of emphasis on lifestyle, relationships and love, resembling \"an R&B Casanova\". Usher was new jack swing oriented, while My Way contained influences of soul. 8701 \"introduces touches of '80s rock guitar and the minimal rhythm of '80s hip hop\" displaying versatility, according to NME's Lucy O'Brien.

Raymond V Raymond was described as a \"skillful fusion of R&B/hip-hop/pop\" by Billboard. Looking 4 Myself further explored progressive R&B, hip hop ballads and synth pop, with its overall sound coined \"hybrid pop\" for its dynamic incorporation of EDM, dubstep, neo soul and funk.

From the same Publication, John LeLand said that \"the advance word was that it was shocking and outrageous [...] But what brought most of the crowd together at Nassau Coliseum Monday night, was that we weren't shocked. Amused, tickled, stimulated or diverted, maybe, but not shocked or outraged\". Sujata Massey from The Baltimore Sun highlighted the \"passionate\" performances, Madonna's outfits and the \"sexy\" chatter. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune felt that \"though the music certainly offered a few shake-your-booty thrills, it was Madonna the performer, dancer, rogue philosopher and smart-mouthed comic who made the evening memorable\". He praised the singer's stage presence and pointed out the performance of \"Like a Virgin\" for being \"both seductive and hilarious\". Kot concluded his review: \"nothing about this production was second-rate. Each of the evening's 18 songs was expertly choreographed, and the lighting, staging and costuming were often spectacular\". In a mixed review, Jon Pareles from The New York Times wrote that \"Madonna might be testing taboos, but she's hardly breaking new ground in rock theatrics\", also criticizing the use of lip synch; \"she would clearly rather lip-sync than risk a wrong note. It makes the concert airless and off-putting\". Three years later, the same author said that \"with 'Blond Ambition' she was pop's least flirtatious sex symbol\", and deemed it \"proudly uningratiating\". In his review of the show in Gothenburg, Luis Hidalgo from El Pa\u00eds said that \"the big question is knowing if Madonna sings live or not completely [...] The non-existence of natural gasping and agitated breaths reinforces this hypothesis, strongly denied by the organization\". Author Lucy O'Brien was critical of the Dick Tracy act, calling it \"the least dynamic part of the show\". The Blond Ambition World Tour won the award for Most Creative Stage Production at the 1990 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards, and was also nominated in the Major Tour of the Year category.", "The Blond Ambition World Tour has been noted for its theatricality and fashion, something uncommon for concerts at the time. Drew Mackie from People, said that \"Blond Ambition changed the pop-culture landscape\". The fact that the show was divided into different thematic acts represented, according to the author, \"not only a level of creative planning unusual for concerts at the time but also the sheer volume of material Madonna had to work with\". Lucy O'Brien noted that the singer had previously explored \"conceptual musical theatre as concert\" with her Who's That Girl World Tour, but it wasn't until Blond Ambition that \"art, spectacle and dance really came together\". Courtney E. Smith wrote in her book Record Collecting for Girls: Unleashing Your Inner Music Nerd, One Album at a Time that \"[Blond Ambition] forever changed audience expectations for pop concerts. Even if you didn't go, you're probably familiar with that tour\".  Co-Director/Choreographer Vincent Paterson recalled that Madonna's goal was to \"break every rule we can. She wanted to make statements about sexuality, cross-sexuality and the church. And she did\". Dancer Luis Camacho said that Madonna \"set the stage\" for concerts and shows that followed. Scott Anderson concluded that the Blond Ambition Tour changed the way artists present and perform in stadiums and arenas. According to Christopher Rosa from VH1, the tour solidified Madonna's status as a \"cultural tour-de-force and groundbreaking pop artist\". Gina Vivinetto from The Advocate named it Madonna's best tour and wrote that \"until [Blond Ambition] came along, we had no idea what a live concert could be\". For The Odyssey's Rocco Papa, \"[Blond Ambition] offered a level of theatricality not previously seen in pop shows\" and \"set the standard for all pop concerts that followed. Madonna and choreographer Vincent Patterson put together routines that pushed boundaries\". Spin deemed it the sixth greatest concert of the last 35 years. Ilana Kaplan wrote that it \"was more than just shock factor: It was meant to transform live pop music\", and also that it helped Madonna \"reclaim her narrative and power as the tabloids (wrongfully) deemed her a villain\". Idolators Mike Wass considered it the \"blueprint for modern concerts [...] The Queen of Pop really shook things up by giving choreography, costumes and production as much attention as the live vocals\".

J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his biography of Madonna, wrote that much of the book appears surprising not shocking. He derided the concept as childish and impetuous. Though Madonna insisted she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, he believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it: \"She was being a brat, not a revolutionary.\" Author Lucy O'Brien declared the book a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonna's attempt at invincibility, it appeared to be \"a curious act of self-destruction\". Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone said \"The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing\". Describing the photographs as \"derivative\", he wrote that, \"Madonna herself seems far too eager to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisel's self-congratulatory \u2013 and silly \u2013 sense of their own 'bravery,' as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary.\"", "Continuing her provocative work, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which features her fully nude engaging in simulated sexual acts. In March 1994, she was a guest on Late Show with David Letterman, used profanity, and handed Letterman a pair of her underwear asking him to smell it. The release of her sexually explicit works, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman led some critics to see Madonna as a sexual renegade. She also faced a strong negative reaction from critics and fans who commented that \"she had gone too far\" and that her career was over.

It's just the Top 40 that got small!\", and that \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina' stank then, stinks now\". Author Lucy O'Brien wrote in the book, Madonna: Like an Icon, that although Madonna's vocals lacked emotional complexity in the tune, she nevertheless created a \"compelling\" version, \"right up to its grand orchestral finale\". George Hatza from The Reading Eagle, said that \"[Madonna] sings 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in a beautiful, soaring, goosebump-inducing contralto\". Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, wrote: \"Madonna, to her credit, puts on quite a show. She sings. She tangos [...] She even belts out 'Don't Cry for Me Argentina' to prove she's just folks\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented: \"Easily one of Madonna's greatest vocal performances to date, the singer's dramatic interpretation of Evita's unofficial theme song was both loyal and bizarrely autobiographical\". Spins Annie Zaleski wrote that the \"nuanced but proud\" rendition of the song \"marked the start of Madonna\u2019s Serious Phase, one where she balanced youthful coquettishness with a more mature, introspective outlook\".

According to Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, the harmonic and melodic styles were more \"complex\" than the songs which Madonna was accustomed to, hence she found it difficult and demanding. She spoke about the \"wilderness\" of the tunes, saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs, and neither was Sondheim. But he kept on encouraging the singer so that the recording sessions would not be affected. Madonna also recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement. According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, after Madonna's split from husband Sean Penn in 1989, the singer was comfortable in her new relationship with Beatty, which influenced the songs. The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten-piece live band and jazz musicians. The sessions took place at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, California, and concluded by three weeks. The songs on the album reflect Madonna's showgirl personality where her singing ranged from \"rootsy, rocking\" in nature to slow, \"laid-back and soulful\" vocals. A studied approach was evident in most of them, which O'Brien compared to \"an actress playing a part and performing a vocal exercise in technique\". Some of the songs had Madonna pitching her vocals and belting the notes only when necessary. A dryness was prevalent in most of the singing, which was required for the songs and the setting. Guy Pratt, who also played bass, said that the singer \"was in character and started smoking. She actually ponced a cigarette off me. Her character smoked, so therefore she did.\""]}, {"page": "True Blue (Madonna album)", "response": ["According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, the album artwork was on-par with Andy Warhol's concept of pop art. She felt that the image was a mixture of innocence and idealism, while incorporating 1950s-style Technicolor and hand tinted color, characteristic of Warhol's silkscreen printed design, prevalent in the 1960s. Jeri Heiden, the album's cover designer, commented, \"She was already highly aware of the value of her image and was in control of it.\" O'Brien felt that the artwork heralded the arrival of a new Madonna, while drawing on the enduring appeal of her celluloid icon Marilyn Monroe. \"With this picture, Madonna made explicit the connection between Warhol and herself, the vivid nexus between pop art and commerce. The late 1980s marked a new era of the pop artist as a brand, and Madonna became the first one to exploit this.\""]}, {"page": "Ray of Light", "response": ["According to Taraborrelli, the album has been hailed as bold and refreshing in contemporary music of the late 1990s, which was dominated by boybands and teenage artists such as the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Larry Flick from Billboard said that the album \"not only provided the chameleon-like artist with her first universally applauded critical success, it has also proved that she remains a vital figure amongst woefully fickle young audiences.\" Music critic Lucy O'Brien commented: \"1998's Ray of Light certainly rehabilitated Madonna's image. Up to that point she had still been written off as an average pop glamour girl who got lucky, but with this record she reached a whole new audience, proving that she was a good songwriter with an intensely productive talent.\" Mary von Aue from Stereogum stated that \"Ray of Light reestablished Madonna as a groundbreaking artist.\""]}, {"page": "American Life", "response": ["The glamorous world of Hollywood also reflected in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that \"in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself.\" The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate on the things that did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track \"Mother and Father\". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was \"a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on.\" According to Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, another concept of American Life was about \"nothingness\". This was evident in the titles of the songs like \"Nobody Knows Me\", usage of \"no\" in \"Love Profusion\", as well as \"Nothing Fails\". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But \"Nothing Fails\", along with tracks \"Intervention\" and \"X-Static Process,\" became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, \"Nothing Fails\" also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired \"Intervention\" and \"X-Static Process,\" both being reflective and emotional.

Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon deemed the album a \"seamless marriage of high-octane pop and dance\", as well as \"the ultimate party record\". Robert Christgau gave the album an A+ rating and called it \"the greatest album of [Madonna's] mortal life\".

In a similar review, Lucy O'Brien, author of Madonna: Like an Icon, relegated the track as \"a resurrection of the disco girl\" image. She listed \"Music\" as a career-defining moment for Madonna, like previous singles \"Vogue\" and \"Justify My Love\" (both released in 1990). O'Brien clarified the song as \"the same genre defining quality, robotic, tinny, trashy and audacious... She resurrects the Madonna imperative. Dance. Party. Surrender\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it \"a thumping track which sounds funkier, denser, sexier with each spin\". Jim Farber of the New York Daily News gave a positive feedback, stating that it is \"everything a single should be: pithy, simple and maddeningly catchy, her most instantly embraceable single since 'Holiday'\". Farber also highlighted the lyrics, which he felt covered familiar ground for Madonna by talking about the power of dance music.

In his book Madonna: An Intimate Biography, author J. Randy Taraborrelli described the song as \"clever\", adding that no matter how many time one listens to it, \"it never ceases to intrigue\". Chris Wade, author of The Music of Madonna recalled that \"Secret\" had been his favorite song, and commended the track's production, Madonna's vocals and mixing. He declared it as \"one of Madonna's finest cuts from the whole of her 90s output.\" Wade described the chorus as \"sinister and catchy; a strange eeriness about it that only the mystery of the forbidden can conjure.\" Matthew Rettenmund wrote in his Encyclopedia Madonnica that \"Secret\" paved way a new direction musically for Madonna; he believed that the track was more haunting musically than Madonna's previous single \"Who's That Girl\" (1987) and comparable to \"Justify My Love\" (1990). Rettenmund complimented the cover artwork, saying that \"a dozen years into her career, it was one of her most arresting poses shot by Demarchelier, a testament to the durability of her star appeal\". Author Lucy O'Brien described the song in her book, Madonna: Like an Icon:"]}, {"page": "True Blue (Madonna song)", "response": ["Madonna's vocal range spans a bit less than one and a half octaves, from F3 to B4. The chorus is backed by sounds of bells ringing, an alternate verse\u2014\"This time I know it's true\"\u2014 which is sung by three back-up singers during the interlude, and a bass counter melody which introduces her vocals during the second chorus. The lyrics are constructed in a verse-chorus form, with the theme being Madonna's feelings for Penn; it uses the archaic love word \"dear\" in the line \"Just think back and remember, dear\". According to author Lucy O'Brien, who wrote in her biography Madonna: Like an Icon, the verse-and-chorus composition was reminiscent of The Dixie Cups' 1964 single \"Chapel of Love\", with backup singers Siedah Garrett and Edie Lehman accompanying Madonna's convincing \"girly\" vocals like a choir."]}, {"page": "Like a Prayer (song)", "response": ["Recording took more time than usual since Madonna and Leonard fought \"tooth and nail\" in the studio. According to author Lucy O'Brien, the singer wanted to prove that her second chance as a record producer (following her previous album True Blue) was not a fluke. Leonard started working on the chord changes for the verses and the chorus. He had hired guitarist Bruce Gaitsch and bass guitar player Guy Pratt to work on the track. Pratt had in turn hired some additional drummers. On the day of the recording, the drummers canceled, which irritated Madonna, and she started shouting and swearing profusely at Leonard and Pratt. The producer then hired British drum and guitar players such as Chester Kamen, along with Americans David Williams and Dann Huff. He commented that the choice was deliberate since he was a fan of British rock, and wanted that kind of attitude and quirkiness of the musicians in \"Like a Prayer\", as well as the other songs of the album. Pratt was not fired, but later he realized that Madonna did not forgive him; she would call him at late nights for his opinion, and urgently ask him to come to the recording studio, only to be dismissed.", "Following the release of \"Like a Prayer\" on March 3, 1989, it received widespread acclaim from critics, journalists and academics. Taraborrelli commented that the track \"deserved every bit of the curiosity it generated. While being devilishly danceable, the song also shows Madonna's uncanny ability to inspire strong, conflicting emotions during the course of a single song, leaving the listener scratching his head for answers\u2014and craving for more.\" Stephen Holden from The New York Times, while writing about Madonna's re-invention of her image, observed how her sound had changed from the \"simple blaring dance-pop to the rich, fully rounded pop of 'Like a Prayer\". Lucy O'Brien felt that the most remarkable aspect of \"Like a Prayer\" was Madonna's usage of liturgical words. \"There is the surface meaning, forging sexuality with pop lyrics that sound so sweet. But underlying that is a rigorous mediation on prayer. In shorter words, 'Like a Prayer' really takes you there,\" she concluded. This view was shared by Mary Cross, who wrote in her biography of Madonna that \"the song is a mix of the sacred and the profane. There-in lies Madonna's triumph with 'Like a Prayer'. It still sounds catchy and danceable.\""]}, {"page": "Vogue (Madonna song)", "response": ["\"Vogue\" was included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\", and was voted number five on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s. Time called it \"the most famous fashion song of all time\", although the song was not specifically about the [Vogue] magazine. Author Lucy O'Brien, in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, wrote a detailed description of the song's influence:"]}, {"page": "Bedtime Story (Madonna song)", "response": ["According to Lucy O'Brien in her book Madonna: Like an Icon, Madonna wanted to \"make an impact\" on the soul music scene, and started working with prominent producers from the R&B market. Madonna also wanted to explore British club music scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. She decided to work with several European producers and composers from the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his \"very European sensibility\". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, writing sessions started taking place in Chappell Studios, Encino, California."]}]}}
