It was during this time that White became more openly political.  He began to occasionally comment on current issues. He was among the first group of the Companions of the Order of Australia in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir John Kerr. In 1979, his novel The Twyborn Affair was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by Penelope Fitzgerald, who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage."]}, {"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["Writers associated with Oxford include Vera Brittain, A.S.

One of the teachers at the school, the writer Penelope Fitzgerald, who taught French, remembered Camilla as \"bright and lively\".

A major exhibit in 1989 at the Barbican Art Gallery, London (in book form as: John Christian, The Last Romantics, 1989), traced Burne-Jones's influence on the next generation of artists, and another at Tate Britain in 1997 explored the links between British Aestheticism and Symbolism."]}, {"page": "1916 in literature", "response": ["*December 17 \u2013 Penelope Fitzgerald (Penelope Knox), English novelist (died 2000)"]}, {"page": "List of years in literature", "response": ["*2000 in literature \u2013 Zadie Smith's White Teeth; Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay; Naomi Klein's No Logo; Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat; Dan Brown's Angels & Demons; Maeve Binchy's Scarlet Feather;  Ken Follett's Code to Zero; Death of Sally Amis (daughter of Sir Kingsley and sister of Martin),  Gwendolyn Brooks, Penelope Fitzgerald, Charles M.

In 1953 Muriel Spark was baptized in the Church of England but in 1954 she decided to join the Roman Catholic Church, which she considered crucial in her development toward becoming a novelist. Penelope Fitzgerald, a fellow novelist and contemporary of Spark, wrote that Spark \"had pointed out that it wasn't until she became a Roman Catholic ... that she was able to see human existence as a whole, as a novelist needs to do\".. In an interview with John Tusa on BBC Radio 4, she said of her conversion and its effect on her writing that she \"was just a little worried, tentative. Would it be right, would it not be right? Can I write a novel about that \u2013 would it be foolish, wouldn't it be?
