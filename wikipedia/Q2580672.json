The town attracted many of the country\u2019s leading artists such as E A Hornel, William Mouncey, William Stewart MacGeorge, Charles Oppenheimer, Jessie M King, E A Taylor and S J Peploe. These artists and craftspeople produced an extensive body of work.

Hornel first came to prominence as one of the Glasgow Boys. He worked in Glasgow sharing a studio with George Henry (1858-1943) but maintained his connections with his home town. As a result, the town became known to several of the \u2018Boys\u2019, particularly George Henry and James Guthrie (1859-1930), as a favoured summer painting location, taking over from previous summer resorts, for example Brig o\u2019Turk in the Trossachs and Cockburnspath in Berwickshire. The presence of the artist John Faed (1818-1902) at Gatehouse-of-Fleet, just eight miles from Kirkcudbright, and his evident support for the younger generation of Kirkcudbrightshire artists, was a further factor leading to the evolution of an artistic community in Kirkcudbright. The combination of professional experience and career success, coupled with youthful energy, ambition and enthusiasm, led to the establishment of the Kirkcudbrightshire Fine Arts Association in 1886, with John Faed as its President,  and younger artists such as Hornel, Thomas Bromley Blacklock (1863-1903) and William Stewart MacGeorge (1861-1931) on the Committee, together with several older, local amateur painters."]}, {"page": "Kirkcudbright Tolbooth", "response": ["Kirkcudbright Tolbooth has been the subject of paintings by a number of notable artists.
