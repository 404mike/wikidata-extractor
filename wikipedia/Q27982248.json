Their unit was posted to the Far East, where they were captured by Japanese forces in Java in 1941 and spent the duration of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp before being released in September 1945. During his time in the camp, Curtis taught Japanese officers how to play football with a ball made out of paper in order to obtain food. The effects of his imprisonment led Curtis to lose nearly half his body weight and his son later remarked how Curtis' wife barely recognised him on his return home. Curtis later attributed his survival to the fitness obtained from his football career."]}, {"page": "1921 in Wales", "response": ["*18 October \u2013 Billy James, footballer (d. 1980)"]}, {"page": "South Wales derby", "response": ["With football restricted during wartime, the close proximity of the two sides led to them being grouped together in regional wartime leagues.

Numerous players at the club served during the conflict although reserve team goalkeeper Jackie Pritchard was the only player who perished. Some players, such as Billy James, found that the war left them unable to return to professional football. Several players who had trained in the club's feeder teams during the war went on to form the backbone of the first team on the resumption of the Football League for the 1946\u201347 season. However, Spiers was not around to take part in their success having resigned from his position over a contractual dispute with the board. He had agreed to take a paycut during the war but walked out after the board refused to restore his original contract at the end of hostilities. Billy McCandless was appointed in his stead and, despite suffering defeat against Spiers' new side Norwich City in their opening game, they were crowned as champions of Third Division South after finishing nine points clear of their nearest rivals. Forward Stan Richards scored 30 league goals during the campaign, setting a new club record that stood until 2003. Despite his success, McCandless decided to accept an offer from local rivals Swansea Town and left his position. In response, Spiers settled his argument with the board and return to the club for a second spell."]}]}}
