He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1816 to 1822.\nFownes Luttrell was the second surviving son of John Fownes Luttrell I (1752\u20131816). His mother Mary was a daughter of Francis Drewe of The Grange, Broadhembury, Devon. He was educated at Eton and at Brasenose College, Oxford, and called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1813.His father died on 16 February 1816, and on 12 March Henry was elected unopposed to his father's parliamentary seat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Minehead. The seat was a pocket borough which had been dominated since the 16th century by the Luttrell family, who owned the feudal barony of Dunster. Successive generations of Lutrells had used the borough to elect themselves and their allies or paying guests, and Fownes Luttrell's older brother John Fownes Luttrell II had held the borough's second seat since 1812.The Fownes Luttrell brothers were re-elected unopposed in 1818 and 1820,\nbut Henry resigned his seat in 1822 to become a Commissioner of the Board of Audit.His brother John died in 1857, when Henry succeeded to the Dunster Castle estates which John had inherited from their father's estate. They covered more than 15,000 acres (6,100 ha), and at the time yielded an income of over \u00a320,000 per annum (equivalent to \u00a31.92 million in 2021).\nHenry died unmarried on 6 October 1867, aged 77.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Luttrell", "response": ["* Henry Fownes Luttrell (died 1780) (\u20131780) of Dunster Castle, High Sheriff of Somerset 1754\u201355, Member of Parliament (MP) for Minehead 1768\u201374", "* Henry Fownes Luttrell (1790\u20131867), MP for Minehead 1816\u201322"]}, {"page": "Minehead (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Henry Fownes Luttrell I", "| Henry Fownes Luttrell II"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1806\u20131818)", "response": ["|12 March 1816||Minehead||u*||John Fownes Luttrell||Henry Fownes Luttrell||Death"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1818\u20131832)", "response": ["|12 April 1822||Minehead||u||Henry Fownes Luttrell||John Douglas||Resignation"]}, {"page": "Feudal barony of Dunster", "response": ["====Henry Fownes Luttrell (c. 1722 \u2013 1780)====", "====Henry Fownes Luttrell (1790\u20131867)====", "Henry Fownes Luttrell (1790\u20131867), younger brother and heir, JP and MP for Minehead 1816\u201322.
