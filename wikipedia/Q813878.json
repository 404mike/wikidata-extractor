Jezzard's teenage years coincided with the Second World War, and he began football as an amateur with Croxley Boys and later Watford, for whom he made three FA Cup appearances. Upon the resumption of peacetime football, Jezzard spent his entire professional career as a striker at Fulham, during the 1940s and 1950s. He holds the club's post-war record for league goals scored in a season \u2013 38 in 1953\u201354. His Fulham career lasted only from 1948 to 1957, due to an irreversible injury. During his time at Fulham, he was picked for the London XI in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.\nHe won two England caps in 1954\u201355 and three England B caps, scoring six goals making him the England B all-time top scorer.\nJezzard later managed Fulham from 1958 until 1964, taking them back into the First Division. He became discontented with the changes in football culture in the mid-1960s \u2013 essentially the abolition of the maximum wage (through teammates Jimmy Hill and Johnny Haynes), which led to the concentration of power in the hands of the richer clubs \u2013 and retired to run a pub.\nHe died in May 2005 at the age of 77, and had been ill with multi-infarct dementia for some time before his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["|| Bedford Jezzard"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 in English football", "response": ["*21 May 2005: Bedford Jezzard, 77, was a centre forward for Fulham and England during the 1950s."]}, {"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["Celtic finished eighth in the Scottish League during 1952\u201353 and were only invited to the pan-British Coronation Cup tournament due to their large support base.
