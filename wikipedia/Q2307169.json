From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the \"Bromley Contingent\", as most of them came from the Bromley area in south east London, a label Severin came to despise. \"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \"The Lord's Prayer\"."]}, {"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen. Early line-ups of The Strand\u2014sometimes known as The Swankers\u2014also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass.Savage, Jon. England's Dreaming, pp. 77\u201379; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 84.

McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the '50s rocker look associated with Marlon Brando. As John Lydon later observed, \"Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto.\"Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 83. The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni, Gene October, and Mark Stewart, among many others.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 83\u201384, 86\u201387, 89, 102, 105. Jordan, the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with \"pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look\".Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 84.", "Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre\u2014and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 217, 224\u2013225; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 137\u2013138.

Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\".For the sort of thing in Kent's past for which he arguably \"deserved\" a beating\u2014physically assaulting his then-girlfriend Chrissie Hynde at the McLaren-Westwood shop\u2014see Matlock, Glen, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, pp. 59\u201360; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 116. According to a later description by McLaren, \"When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\" \"Everyone agreed he had the look,\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\".Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 143. For a view that Vicious was a more competent bass player than his reputation would have it, see Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 117.

From 1977 to 1982 he performed with Adam and the Ants and their debut album Dirk Wears White Sox (1979) reached number one on the UK Independent Albums Chart. Prior to recording his second album as Adam and the Ants, he asked producer Malcolm McLaren to manage his band, who instead took his backing band to form Bow Wow Wow. Ant regrouped with new members, including Marco Pirroni to release his second album Kings of the Wild Frontier (1980). It reached number one in the UK Album Chart, spawned three hit singles and the album was the UK number one selling album in 1981 (and the 48th best seller in 1980) and won Best British Album at the 1982 Brit Awards. He released his third and final album with the group, Prince Charming (1981), which spawned two UK number one singles \"Stand and Deliver\" and \"Prince Charming\".", "In 1982, he disbanded his group for a solo career retaining only Marco Pirroni as a bandmember and co-songwriter for later solo albums. His first solo album was Friend or Foe (1982), which the debut single \"Goody Two Shoes\" reached number one in the UK and Australia in 1982 and became his first top 20 hit in the United States. The album reached number five on the UK Albums Chart and number 16 on the US Billboard Album Chart, becoming his most successful solo album. His next two solo albums Strip (1983) and Vive Le Rock (1985) were less commercially successful in the UK and US and were a noted stylistic departure of his earlier rock albums; being more grounded in pop and dance. During this time, Ant also began to focus on an acting career performing on stage and in television and movie roles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He released his fourth solo album Manners & Physique (1990) which was produced by Andr\u00e9 Cymone and featured a Minneapolis sound. Despite the US Top 20 success of the single \"Room at the Top\" from that album, Ant was dropped from MCA Records and the fully recorded Persuasion (1991) was shelved and never officially released. He signed with Capitol Records to release Wonderful (1995), which featured more acoustic songs than his previous albums. The single \"Wonderful\" became Ant's third US Top 40 hit single.", "A new version of Adam and the Ants was formed with Marco Pirroni (guitar), Kevin Mooney (bass guitar), and two drummers, Terry Lee Miall and Chris Hughes (ex-Dalek I Love You), who used the name \"Merrick\". The band signed a major label deal with CBS Records and recorded Kings of the Wild Frontier during the summer of 1980. The album was an enormous hit in the United Kingdom, and the \"Antmania\" that ensued put the band at the forefront of the New Romantic movement. The single \"Antmusic\" went to No.\u00a02 on the UK singles chart by December 1980, but made it to No. 1 in the charts in Australia. Following the abrupt departure of Mooney in February 1981, bassist Gary Tibbs, formerly of Roxy Music, joined the band.", "In an April 2010 interview for the NME, Ant announced he was also working on a new album, with the title Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter. This was planned to feature collaborations with former 3 Colours Red guitarist Chris McCormack, Ant's long-time songwriting partner Marco Pirroni, a member of Oasis (later identified as Andy Bell) and Morrissey's writing partner Boz Boorer. According to Ant, the album is a \"live record that lends itself to performance\" and will feature a \"kind of concept. It's a very old-fashioned, old-school, step-by-step album\".  He also described the album as \"very autobiographical, very personal.\" In addition, Ant re-recorded a song in tribute to the late Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who died earlier that month, and who also once managed Adam & The Ants. Named Who's A Goofy Bunny Then?, the track was only previously available as a demo recorded in the early 1980s, but Ant stated he wanted to release a new version in tribute to the late punk manager. \"Malcolm was a sort of mentor in my life\", he said. \"As close as you can get to a surrogate father\".
