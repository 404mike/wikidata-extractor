They signed him in 1990. His subsequent performances there alerted Southend United manager Barry Fry, who paid \u00a3100,000 to bring him to Roots Hall in 1993.\nOtto followed Fry to Birmingham City for \u00a3800,000 in 1994 but never really settled at the club, having spells on loan at Charlton Athletic, Peterborough United and Notts County. He was however part of the side that won the 1995 Football League Trophy Final and set up the winning goal for Paul Tait. He has the conspicuous record of having scored both goals in a 1\u20131 draw on his debut against Cambridge United. Released in 1998, he had a spell in non-League football before signing for Rhyl in 2002.\nAfter retiring from football, Otto trained and worked as a probation officer, and went on to found a consultancy working with offenders and those at risk of offending. He became a Christian, and took a degree in theology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 9", "response": ["*1967 \u2013 Ricky Otto, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Otto (surname)", "response": ["* Ricky Otto (born 1967), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1995 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|MF || ||Ricky Otto"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["| 19 September 1996 || Ricky Otto || Charlton Athletic || Two months", "| 6 February 1997 || Ricky Otto || Peterborough United || End of season", "!scope=\"row\"| Ricky Otto"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["| Ricky Otto || Notts County || One month", "!scope=\"row\"|Ricky Otto"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Ricky Otto"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Ricky Otto"]}]}}
