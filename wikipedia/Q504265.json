I was surprised but things change and I wasn't going to play\". Just three days after being transfer-listed, Chorley joined League One side Gillingham on a three-month loan deal. After being deemed fit to play, he made his debut for Gillingham as a second-half substitute for Andrew Crofts in a 2\u20130 home win over Carlisle United two days after joining the club. His first goal for the club ultimately turned out to be the winner as Gillingham came from two goals down to secure a 3\u20132 away win over Tranmere Rovers in December 2006. A month later, Chorley signed a loan extension with the Kent club, meaning he would remain at the club for the remainder of the 2006\u201307 season. He made 27 appearances, of which 24 were starting, as Gillingham finished the season in 16th place. At the end of the campaign, on 8 May 2007, Gillingham stated that Chorley's loan agreement with the club had ended, and that he would return to his parent club. On his return to MK Dons, his contract was terminated by mutual consent, and the player was able to look for a new club on a free transfer. During Chorley's three-year association with Milton Keynes Dons, he made 91 appearances and scored three goals."]}, {"page": "Crofts", "response": ["*Andrew Crofts (b. 1953), English writer", "*Andrew Crofts (b. 1984), Welsh professional football player"]}, {"page": "Andrew Crofts", "response": ["Andrew Crofts may refer to:", "* Andrew Crofts (author) (born 1953), British author", "* Andrew Crofts (footballer) (born 1984), Wales international footballer"]}, {"page": "Gary Mulligan", "response": ["His hard-working style had impressed Gillingham manager Ronnie Jepson and on 12 May 2006 he signed for Gillingham on a permanent basis.
