He was managing director of the Jardine Matheson Group from 2000 to 31 March 2006 having joined the board in 1999.\nWeatherall joined the Jardine Group in 1976 and worked in a number of senior executive positions in Hong Kong, the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Korea and the Philippines, prior to becoming \"Tai-Pan\".  Weatherall was chief executive officer of Hongkong Land.\nWeatherall is a member of the Keswick family which control Jardine Matheson through complex cross-shareholdings, despite holding only around 10% of the shares in the company.   During Weatherall's period in charge, the company defended itself against Brandes Investment Partners who proposed the company break itself up to release extra shareholder value, and Jardines undertook large scale strategic investment in Astra International of Indonesia via the Singapore company Jardine Cycle & Carriage. He was succeeded as group managing director by Anthony Nightingale on 1 April 2006.\nWeatherall is currently on the board of directors at Dairy Farm Group, which operates several high street supermarkets across Asia. Weatherall has been criticised in the media for Dairy Farm's use of eggs from caged hens - undercover investigative footage was released alongside an official complaint to the Singapore Food Agency in February 2021 from a consumer and animal rights organisation called Equitas Global. Equitas Global has also published more details about Percy Weatherall's role at Dairy Farm, as well at the video footage of the caged farms used by the company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nicholas Soames", "response": ["Soames has been married twice.
