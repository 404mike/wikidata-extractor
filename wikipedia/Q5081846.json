Harding (aka \u2018Wag\u2019 Harding) (c.1866 \u2013 ?) was an English professional single sculler who became the Champion of England and was a contender for the World Sculling Championship. He was born in London circa 1866 and his occupation was that of a waterman. Like many of the professional English scullers, he had won the Doggett's Coat and Badge (in 1888), but at 5 ft 5 \u00bd in and 9 st 5 lb he was not regarded as one of the heavy men. He made a name for himself in 1883, when he, at 16 years old, won the Chelsea Coat and Badge, and a year later, the Putney Coat and Badge. He was reported in the mid-1890s that \u201che pulls a beautiful even stroke, gets well over his sculls, while his leg-work is greatly admired.\u201d\nHarding trained the New Zealander Tom Sullivan when Sullivan had challenged George Bubear for the English Sculling Championship, which Sullivan won in September 1893. Thereafter, Harding himself challenged Sullivan for the English championship title. They sculled for the title on the Tyne River in February 1895, and Sullivan lost to his trainer. \nIn September 1895 they had a re-match on the Championship Course on the Thames and again Harding won. His time was 22 minutes 59 seconds.\nIn July 1896, Harding challenged the Australian Jim Stanbury for the World Sculling Championship Title. The race again took place on the Thames but Stanbury defended his title and won the wager of \u00a3500 a side. At stake was the English Title as well.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wag", "response": ["* Charles R.

Stanbury had won the Title in Sydney in 1891 and had held off a couple of challenges in Australia in 1892. He travelled to North America and had hoped to meet Gaudaur for a match but terms could not be agreed so he returned home. Later he headed to England where he defeated Charles R. Harding on the Thames. After this it was arranged that Gaudaur would finally row Stanbury for the Title. It would have been easier for Gaudaur to travel to England rather than Australia for a match as normally the challenger travelled to where the Champion resided. The race was set down for the 7 September 1896 and was to be raced on the Thames, on the famous Championship Course (Putney to Mortlake.) The stake was for the extraordinary sum of \u00a31000 a side. Gaudaur's physical details were given at this time as; height 6\u00a0ft, weight 12.5\u00a0st, chest 41 inches, or more.
