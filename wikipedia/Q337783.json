He started work at the age of nine in a cotton mill, having passed himself off as thirteen. In 1850, the family moved to Paisley and William found work at Coats\u2019s Cotton Thread Manufacturing making bobbins. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a blacksmith at Paisley, supplementing his practical education with night school classes and the purchase of books on engineering.", "At end of his apprenticeship William Arrol worked as a journeyman blacksmith with mixed success. Work was not easy to find and in 1858, now aged nineteen, he took a job at Ker\u2019s factory at Paisley. Eventually he was engaged as a foreman at Laidlaw\u2019s Engineering Works in Glasgow.  Here he was entrusted with his first bridges: the Greenock and Ayrshire Railway at Greenock in 1885 and the West Pier at Brighton 1866. After two years, Arrol had saved enough money to set up with a friend as boiler and girder makers. However, they incurred heavy losses through non-payment by customers and the partnership was dissolved.

A criminal investigation into the disaster did bring charges against timber merchant Alexander McDougall, who was charged with culpable homicide in June of the same year. McDougall had supplied the wood used in the construction of the stand and was accused of attempting to cut corners by using yellow pine instead of the higher-quality red pine. Noted civil engineers Sir Benjamin Baker and Sir William Arrol appeared as witnesses in McDougall's defence. Both testified that they believed the selection of yellow pine had played no part in the disaster and instead blamed the accident on the construction of the stand. The design was deemed too light for the work for which it was built, having been based on out-of-date textbooks. Baker concluded that the stand's design made it safe for a load of 25\u00a0lb per square foot but estimated that on the day of the match it had experienced loads of up to 75\u00a0lb per square foot.
