If two drums are used, that is often to give a more impressive appearance on large stages, but sometimes, the second drum is being pitched differently to provide some variety in the notes, thus creating a more nuanced sound. The first person to use and popularize the double bass drum setup was jazz drummer Louie Bellson,Mattingly, Rick (2006). All About Drums: A Fun and Simple Guide to Playing Drums, unpaginated. Hal Leonard. . who came up with the idea when he was still in high school. Double bass drums were popularized in the 1960s by rock drummers Ginger Baker of Cream, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Keith Moon of The Who and Nick Mason of Pink Floyd. After 1970, Billy Cobham and Narada Michael Walden used double kick drum with the jazz fusion project Mahavishnu Orchestra, Chester Thompson with Frank Zappa and Weather Report, Barriemore Barlow with Jethro Tull, and Terry Bozzio with Frank Zappa. For these genres the focus was 'odd-meter grooves and mind blowing solos'.Nyman, John (2009). \"Double Bass Legends: A Short History \", DrumMagazine.com.

American thrash metal band Slayer's former drummer Dave Lombardo was named \"the godfather of double bass\" by the magazine Drummerworld.

After leaving grammar school Hammond opted to study painting rather than continue with music, but was convinced to join Jethro Tull in January 1971. Before joining the band as a performer, he appears to have spent much time with the band in the background. Anderson wrote songs about his friend's idiosyncrasies, of which the best known are \"A Song for Jeffrey\" (on the album This Was), \"Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square\" (Stand Up) and \"For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me\" (Benefit). Introducing \"A Song for Jeffrey\" in the days before Hammond joined Jethro Tull, Anderson would portray him in slightly condescending terms as someone with emotional problems who lost his way easily, as described in the first line of the song. His eventual appearance as a band member, therefore, was something of a surprise.
