Palmer was disabled for some months in consequence of an accident when acting Dionysius in The Grecian Daughter, to the Euphrasia of Ann Street Barry. The spring in her dagger refused to work, and she inflicted on him in her simulated fury a serious wound. In 1772 Palmer relinquished his summer engagement at the Haymarket in order to succeed Thomas King at Liverpool, where he became a great favourite, and established himself as a tragedian. One circumstance alone militated against his popularity. He was said to ill-treat his wife. Alarmed at this report, he sent for that long-suffering lady, who came, and hiding, it is said, the bruises on her face inflicted by her husband, who was both false and cruel, walked about Liverpool with him and re-established him in public estimation. Not until 1776 did he reappear at the Haymarket, which, however, from that time remained his ordinary place of summer resort. The retirement of Smith gave Palmer control all but undisputed over the highest comedy. Tribute to his special gifts is involved in his selection for Joseph Surface on the first performance of The School for Scandal, 8 May 1777, a character in which he was by general consent unapproachable."]}, {"page": "False Delicacy", "response": ["The original Drury Lane cast included Thomas King as Cecil, Samuel Reddish as Lord Winworth, Charles Holland as Colonel Rivers, John Palmer as Sir Harry Newburgh, Samuel Cautherley as Sidney, Frances Abington as Lady Betty Lambton, Ann Street Barry as Mrs Harley and Sophia Baddeley as Miss Marchont.
