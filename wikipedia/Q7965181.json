Performed in the manner of a traditional Elizabethan production, the play received mixed reviews.

For example, in the 1981 Bard Productions film, Ross' part was given to the Exton character, and in the Erickson-Farrell 2001 film, Ross was one of seven characters dropped, his part again given to Exton. He has still been played by several actors in post-war performances. At the 1947 Avignon Festival, Pierre Lautrec played to Jean Vilar's Richard; Vilar also directed the play. The same year, Walter Hudd directed it with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Joss Ackland as Ross to Robert Harris' Richard. Four years later, Anthony Quayle\u2014also with the SMT\u2014directed Michael Redgrave as the King, Harry Andrews as Bolingbroke, and Philip Morant in the part of Lord Ross. In 1968 the Prospect Theatre toured Richard II in two legs. Directed by Richard Cottrell and with Ian McKellen and Timothy West as Richard and Bolingbroke respectively, Ross was played by Peter Rocca on the first half of the tour and David Calder on the second. In 1973, Charles Keating played Ross to Richard Pasco and Ian Richardson's king and Bolingbroke, in John Barton's production. Ariane Mnouchkine's 1984 production for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil cast Robert Gourp as Ross, and five years later the English Shakespeare Company's production\u2014directed by Michael Bogdanov\u2014had John Dougall playing Ross to Michael Pennington's Richard. Keith Dunphy played Ross in Steven Pimlott's RSC production in 2000, to Sam West's Richard and David Troughton's Bolingbroke. A production at the Globe Theatre in 2015 from Tim Carroll saw Mark Rylance as the King and Ekow Quartey as Ross. Jonathan Slinger played the King in Michael Boyd's 2007 RSC production, and Rob Carroll played Ross. Joshua Richards played Ross in Gregory Doran's 2013 production, with David Tennant in the lead role."]}, {"page": "Reach for the Sky", "response": ["* Walter Hudd as Air Vice-Marshal Frederick Halahan"]}, {"page": "Sink the Bismarck!", "response": ["* Walter Hudd as Admiral Holland, in HMS Hood"]}, {"page": "List of fictional butlers", "response": ["| Lane || manservant to Algernon Moncrieff in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest ||Richard Wordsworth, John Turnbull, Munson Hicks, Walter Hudd, John Woodnutt, Michael Hordern, Edward Fox, Neil Dickson, Paul O'Brien || 1895 ||"]}, {"page": "The Punch and Judy Man", "response": ["*Walter Hudd \u2014 Clergyman"]}, {"page": "Major Barbara (film)", "response": ["*Walter Hudd as Stephen Undershaft"]}, {"page": "Elephant Boy (film)", "response": ["Petersen (Walter Hudd) hires the father and Kala Nag, among others, for a large annual government roundup of wild elephants to be tamed and put to work.
