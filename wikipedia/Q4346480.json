The video was filmed at Pinewood Studios, home to most Bond productions. During the video, Williams travels in an aeroplane and comically fails to fly a futuristic jet pack. He is also seen flirting with girls in an over-the-top manner and caricaturing the facial expressions of Sean Connery. He is seen in a boat, clearly a studio model, against an obviously projected background characteristic of 1960s Bond films. During the end of the video, Williams drives away in an economy car, a fittingly chosen Bond Bug, instead of 007's Aston Martin DB5, which later drives past him while he is having car trouble. Former model Lorraine Pascale appears in the video as a 'Bond Girl'."]}, {"page": "List of Food Network original programming", "response": ["*Worst Bakers in America - co-hosted by Lorraine Pascale and Duff Goldman, debuted October 2, 2016"]}, {"page": "List of Food Network (Canadian TV channel) personalities", "response": ["*Lorraine Pascale, judge on Spring Baking Championship and Spring Baking Championship and mentor on Worst Bakers in America"]}, {"page": "Lorraine (given name)", "response": ["* Lorraine Pascale (born 1972), British model and TV chef"]}, {"page": "Pascale", "response": ["* Lorraine Pascale, British former model."]}, {"page": "Jason Atherton", "response": ["In 2014 Jason Atherton co-hosted the UK series My Kitchen Rules with Lorraine Pascale.
