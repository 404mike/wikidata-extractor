On learning that his wife was too ill to come out, Rawlinson invited Bath out to lunch, who declined, claiming a prior engagement. Rawlinson returned to the flat later, where he again met Bath. When Bath went to ask Aylwin if she was well enough to receive her husband, Rawlinson heard her ask \"Has he gone?\" which aroused his suspicions about Bath's presence. Aylwin wrote to her husband afterwards, saying he was \"quite wrong\", and that Bath had been \"a good friend\". However, the housekeeper testified that Aylwin and Bath had often been alone together at the flat. The court found for Colonel Rawlinson and granted the divorce."]}]}}
