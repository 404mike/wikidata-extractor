John Esslemont performed the first review of the worldwide progress of the religion in 1919. 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, son of the founder of the religion, then set goals for the community through his Tablets of the Divine Plan shortly before his death. Shoghi Effendi then initiated systematic Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pioneering efforts that brought the religion to almost every country and territory of the world and converts from more than 2,000 tribes and peoples. There were serious setbacks in the Soviet Union\"Notes on the B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Religions in Russia and its Territories\" , by Graham Hassall, Journal of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Studies, 5.3 (Sept.-Dec. 1993) where Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceased to exist. However plans continued building to 1953 when the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds initiated a Ten Year Crusade after plans had focused on Latin America and Europe after WWII. That last stage was largely towards parts of Africa. Due to extensive missionary work, wide-scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa particularly was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. There was diplomatic pressure from northern Arab countries against this development that was eventually overcome. Starting in the 1980s with Perestroyka the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds began to re-organize across the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc. While sometimes failing to meet official minimums for recognitions as a religion, communities of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds do exist from Poland to Mongolia.

Khanum talked to audiences about the future of African Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and their role in the religion. The convention for the 1961 election of the regional national assembly of central and east Africa included 35 delegates from Kenya.

Olinga was able to re-visit Uganda in June, and again in August\u2013September 1962 when he toured widely in Uganda speaking to many groups amounting to thousands of people about the religion before moving on to Kenya and Tanganyika and the Congo. As the monthly rate of growth reached into the hundreds, a goal of the Uganda Teaching Committee was of stimulating the individual assemblies and believers to assume increasing responsibility for weekend schools in their own villages so that traveling teachers could focus in other areas. In September 1962 Milton Obote, then Prime Minister of Uganda, visited the Shrine of the Bab. In 1963 Nakhjavani was elected to the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community, while Olinga chaired the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Congress which announced the election to the world.

The July 1964 issue of Uganda Argus profiled the religion as well as a broad article about the 4 Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Houses of Worship then in existence. One hundred thirty-two delegates and visitors assembled in Kampala, Uganda, for the 1966 convention to elect the regional national assembly of Uganda and Central Africa. Olinga was able to visit Uganda again from October to December 1967 for an extended tour of the country. Rapid expansion of the religion in the late 1960s was most particularly true in Uganda, Vietnam and Indonesia.

During the period of Ayy\u00e1m-i-H\u00e1 1969 the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds had a public exhibit on the religion at the Kamapala national theatre. The mayor of Kampala spoke at the opening preceding the showing of the film, \"And His Name Shall Be One\". The exhibit consisted of books, charts, artifacts, photographs, movies, slides, and recordings. Original Tablets, books, and excerpts written by the B\u00e1b, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 were displayed along with secondary works.

The arts were shown in oil paintings, photographs, silverwork, and handwoven carpets and the diversity of nationalities and religious backgrounds was illustrated with photographs and slides taken during conventions, Temple dedications, and intercontinental conferences. Later that summer Ruhiyyih Khanum visited Uganda on a ten-day tour. In Kampala she was able to attend several events before driving into the countryside to visit Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds.

In March 1925 he met the first person to become a Bah\u00e1\u2019i in New Zealand, Margaret Stevenson, who was on Pilgrimage, and on hearing that she was planning to spend time in the United Kingdom, he urged her to visit his family in Scotland.

While Zamenhof worked on the translations publication was delayed and accomplished out of France by a Polish nephew of Anne Lynch then in a Swiss internment camp for Polish officers. In the second half of 1938 Zamenhof had been a major influence of the conversion of the first known Ukrainian becoming a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, who was living in eastern Poland at the time. Zamenhof mentions there were five Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Poland in August 1939. Contact was made in 1947 with nine individuals investigating the religion mostly through Esperantist writings.
