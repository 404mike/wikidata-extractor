(1874 \u2013 1925), from Scotland, was a prominent British adherent of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.  Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, posthumously named Esslemont a Hand of the Cause of God, one of the Disciples of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (Effendi's predecessor), and one of the United Kingdom's three luminaries of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. He was the author of one of the foremost introductory texts on the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith (Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and the New Era) and worked as a translator of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed texts near the end of his life.  In addition to his work for the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Esslemont was an accomplished physician, as well as a linguist, proficient in English, French, Spanish, German, Esperanto, and later Persian and Arabic.  Dr. Esslemont died of tuberculosis in Palestine in 1925.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
