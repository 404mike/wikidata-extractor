After consultation and protracted difficulties in obtaining copyright for some hymns, CH4 appeared in May 2005. It is published by the Canterbury Press (Norwich) and contains 825 items. In the spirit of Songs of God's People it continues the quest for diversity. For the first time a hymn book which was not specifically produced for the Gaelic community contains a hymn in Gaelic, the christmas carol \"Leanabh an \u00e0igh\", for which the original text now appears in parallel to the translation \"Child in a manger\". Many hymns have been modified to incorporate 'inclusive language'. For example, \"He gave me eyes so I could see\", has been rewritten as \"God gave me eyes so I could see\" (Hymn 164). The feminist theology of the Motherhood of God is represented in \"Mothering God\" (Hymn 117). However, the temptation to reword such as \"thy\" to \"your\" has been resisted for old favourites, so, for example,  \"Great is thy faithfulness\" remains untouched."]}, {"page": "Community of Christ International Peace Award", "response": ["|John L.
