Around 1839, a choral revival took hold in England, partially fuelled by the Oxford Movement, which sought to revive Catholic liturgical practice in Anglican churches. Despite opposition from more Puritan-minded Anglicans, ancient practices such as intoning the versicles and responses and chanted Psalms were introduced. The 16th century setting by John Merbecke for the Communion Service was revived in the 1840s and was almost universally adopted in parish churches. Composers active around this time included Samuel Sebastian Wesley and Charles Villiers Stanford. A number of grandiose settings of the Anglican morning and evening canticles for choir and organ were composed in the late 19th and early 20th century, including settings by Thomas Attwood Walmisley, Charles Wood, Thomas Tertius Noble, Basil Harwood and George Dyson, works which remain part of the Anglican choral repertoire today."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Thomas Attwood Walmisley (Trinity/St John's/Jesus)"]}, {"page": "List of Anglican church composers", "response": ["*Thomas Attwood Walmisley"]}, {"page": "Fairlight, East Sussex", "response": ["The village of Fairlight lies on a minor road between Ore, Pett and Winchelsea.
