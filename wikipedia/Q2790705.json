There are currently over 400 pupils at the school aged 4\u201313 years old. Spratton Hall, the largest house in the village, is a Grade II listed building with grounds extending to 50 acres. The house was probably built in 1760 on the site of an earlier farmhouse. Constructed primarily with limestone from Kingsthorpe, it is a plain three-storey structure with a slate roof. Actor Tenniel Evans taught English and drama there for a short time in the early 1950s before returning to theatre. English international rugby union player Matt Dawson was a gap student at Spratton Hall from 1996 to 1997. Michael Ellis MP was educated there.
