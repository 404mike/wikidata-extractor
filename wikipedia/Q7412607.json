Andrew Plimer (1763\u20131837) was a pupil of Cosway, and both he and his brother Nathaniel Plimer produced some lovely portraits. The brightness of the eyes, wiriness of the hair, exuberance of colour, combined with forced chiaroscuro and often very inaccurate drawing, are characteristics of Andrew Plimer's work. John Smart (c. 1740 1811) was in some respects the greatest of the 18th-century miniaturists. His work was hailed by contemporaries for his excellence in refinement, power and delicacy; its silky texture and elaborate finish, and the artists love for a brown background. Other notable painters were Richard Crosse (1742\u20131810), Ozias Humphry (1742\u20131810), Samuel Shelley (c1750\u20131808), whose best pictures are groups of two or more persons, Henry Edridge (1769\u20131821), John Bogle, and Edward Dayes."]}, {"page": "Royal Watercolour Society", "response": ["The society was founded as the Society of Painters in Water ColoursScott Wilcox et al., Victorian landscape watercolors, Publisher: Hudson Hills, 1992, , 9781555950712, 196 pages (page 18) in 1804 by William Frederick Wells.
