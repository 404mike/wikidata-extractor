This fact was a matter of concern, but an annulment of the marriage was regarded as risky as it could provoke war with England. Queen Joan did not have a strong position at the Scottish court, which was dominated by her mother-in-law, queen dowager Ermengarde. Her English connections nevertheless made her important regardless of her personal qualities. Joan accompanied Alexander to England in September 1236 at Newcastle, and in September 1237 at York, during the negotiations with her brother King Henry III over disputed northern territories. At this point, chronicler Matthew Paris suggests that Joan and Alexander had become estranged and that Joan wished to spend more time in England, and her brother King Henry granted her manors in Driffield, Yorkshire and Fen Stanton in Huntingdonshire to reside if needed. In York, Joan and her sister-in-law Eleanor of Provence agreed to make a pilgrimage to Thomas Becket's shrine in Canterbury."]}, {"page": "Agnes Muir Mackenzie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Agnes Mure Mackenzie "]}, {"page": "Saltire Society Literary Awards", "response": ["The award for History Book of the Year was established in 1965 in honour of the historian Agnes Mure Mackenzie (1891\u20131955)."]}, {"page": "1955 in Scotland", "response": ["* 26 February \u2013 Agnes Mure Mackenzie, writer and historian (born 1891)"]}, {"page": "1938 in Scotland", "response": ["* Agnes Mure Mackenzie publishes The Foundations of Scotland, the first of a 6-volume history."]}, {"page": "1934 in Scotland", "response": ["* Agnes Mure Mackenzie publishes the historical biography Robert Bruce, King of Scots."]}, {"page": "1933 in Scotland", "response": ["* Agnes Mure Mackenzie publishes An Historical Survey of Scottish Literature to 1714."]}, {"page": "1891 in Scotland", "response": ["* 9 April \u2013 Agnes Mure Mackenzie, historian and writer (died 1955)"]}, {"page": "1945 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Agnes Mure Mackenzie, DLitt, for services to the study of history in Scotland."]}, {"page": "1221 in Scotland", "response": ["* 21 June - Marriage at York Minster of Alexander II of Scotland and Joan of EnglandAgnes Mure Mackenzie, The Foundations of Scotland (1957), p. 251."]}]}}
