Lord Catherlough's illegitimate son by Jane Davies took the surname of  Knight and inherited his property.

Frances Dormer, daughter of Charles, 5th Baron Dormer, but who had been  disowned by Robert, attempted to obtain the Barrells estate as his inheritance, against Charles Raleigh Knight, Mr Knight's nephew. The resulting legal dispute was settled by the sale and splitting up of Barrells in 1856. Henry bought parts of the estate whilst the remainder was sold to Mr William Newton, a Birmingham merchant. Most of the heirlooms however descended in the family of Mr Knight's daughter, Georgiana, wife of Edward Bolton King, of Umberslade, Warwickshire."]}, {"page": "Robert Knight (MP)", "response": ["The contents of Barrells Hall were regarded by Knight as his personal property and descended in the family of his only grandson, Maj. Edward Raleigh King, of Chadshunt, son of his daughter, Georgiana, who married Col. Edward Bolton King. The correspondence of Lord Catherlough's first wife, Henrietta St John, Lady Luxborough was given by a member of the family to the British Museum. It is particularly useful for the knowledge it gives of the life in England of her half brother, Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke. In 1946, several portraits of the Knight and St John families were left by Miss Ethel Raleigh King to the De Morgan Foundation at Old Battersea House, and now hang at Lydiard Park, Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire.for further information, see Walter King The King Family of Kirkby Malham, Askham, Umberslade & Chadshunt & the Knight Family of Barrells, 2019.
