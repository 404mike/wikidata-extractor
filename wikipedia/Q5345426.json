After curacies in Devon and Lincolnshire, he joined William Tozer (Bishop in Central Africa) on a mission to Nyasaland in 1863. He was appointed Bishop in Central Africa in 1874 and died on 26 August 1882.Edward Steere spent several years in Zanzibar, 1864\u201368, 1872\u201374, and 1877\u201382. In 1873 he placed the foundation stone at Christ Church, Zanzibar, in Stone Town, Zanzibar. The cathedral was based on a vision of Edward Steere's who actively contributed to the design; its unique concrete roof shaped in an unusual barrel vault was Steere's idea. Edward Steere also worked with David Livingstone to abolish slavery in Zanzibar. He is buried behind the altar in the church. David Livingstone's aides James Chuma and Abdullah Susi also were part of an expedition lead by Steere. Chuma was captain of the expedition and both men acted as interpreters.Steere was a considerable linguist and published works on several East African languages and dialects, including Shambala, Yao, Nyamwezi, and Makonde. But he is especially known for his work on Swahili, publishing a Handbook of Swahili in 1870, and he also translated or revised the translation into Swahili of a large part of the Bible.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Skegness", "response": ["Several notable religious figures either lived in the town or served it in some capacity: Edward Steere (1828\u20131882) was curate from 1858 to 1862,Charles Alexander Harris, \"Steere, Edward\", in Sidney Lee (ed.), Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 54 (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1898), p. 141.

The site for the mission village at Masasi was reportedly chosen by African converts whom the missionaries were attempting to lead back to the homes from which they had been captured by slavers: though sure that the site was not their original home, they said it resembled it enough to settle.Wilson (1971) p. 42 Via these routes, two missionaries, Charles Janson and William Percival Johnson, first reached the lake in 1884; Janson died there, but he lent his name to a ship the UMCA commissioned for use in ministering around the lake.Keable (1912) which Steere's successor, Charles Alan Smythies, was able to use to travel widely through Africa on mission work.Keable (1912) 112 He oversaw the establishment on Likoma Island, in the lake, of a mission station, and then of an entire new diocese with its own bishop and its own cathedral,Keable (1912) 134-6 St Peter's, is still standing in the 21st century."]}, {"page": "Christ Church, Zanzibar", "response": ["It was built in seven years, the foundation stone being laid on Christmas Day 1873 until the opening on Christmas 1879, based on a vision of Edward Steere, third Anglican bishop of Zanzibar, who actively contributed to the design.
