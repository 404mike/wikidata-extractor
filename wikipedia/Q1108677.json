The Southwark Mysteries London: Oberon Books pg.9]  In The Book of The Constable, one of the poems of The Southwark Mysteries, 'The Goose and the Crow' seem to prophesy the chain of coincidences that  lead Constable to write a contemporary mystery play with the support of the Very Rev'd Colin Slee, Dean of Southwark Cathedral, and the actor Mark Rylance, then artistic director of Shakespeare's Globe.  In the play, Jesus ('The Son of Man in the street') returns to Southwark to save its lost souls, the heretic John Crow, and The Goose in the guise of Mary Magdalene.  The play premi\u00e8red in Shakespeare's Globe \u2013 with the climactic Harrowing of Hell scene staged in Southwark Cathedral \u2013 on Easter Sunday, 23 April 2000.  The Dean defended the performance of this controversial work in the Cathedral.  A headline in The Sunday Telegraph read: 'Dean rejects critics of Southwark's \"swearing Jesus\" Mystery Play'."]}]}}
