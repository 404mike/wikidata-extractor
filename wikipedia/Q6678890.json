He held the seat until his death in 1864, aged 38.\nDuring the enthusiasm for the Volunteer Movement in 1859\u201360, although his brothers were connected with the 2nd (Seaham) Durham Artillery Volunteer Corps formed at the family's Seaham Colliery, Lord Adolphus raised and commanded an infantry corps, the Sunderland Rifles.According to Anne Isba, author and Victorian Studies scholar, Vane was \"notoriously unstable\" and was \"described by Queen Victoria as having 'a natural tendency to madness.'  Vane, who on one occasion violently attacked his wife and infant son, died four years later during a struggle with four keepers.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
