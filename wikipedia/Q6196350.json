A fashion photographer for magazines during the late sixties and seventies, he worked closely with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour in London and New York on fashion and advertising shoots. He switched to film directing in the late seventies, creating hundreds of television commercials as well as working on several full-length feature films. His earlier photographs form part of the permanent collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum, with additional photographs in the archives of The Multimedia Art Museum, Moscow. A book of his life's work entitled Jim Lee / Arrested was launched in May 2012 alongside an exhibition of photographs from the book at Somerset House, London. Lee's work is regularly exhibited at art galleries around the world, and he continues to collaborate on imaginative campaigns, in addition to developing his own creative projects. In September 2015, Lee's autobiographical book LIFE IN B&W was released by Quartet at the Groucho Club in London. In 2016, Lee was a speaker at the Oxford Literary Festival, where he was also interviewed by writer Paul Blezard. In October 2018, Lee's latest book, The BOX, was published by The Box Book Company. In 2019, Lee published My BOX, a version of The BOX for children between the ages of 8-15 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of photographers", "response": ["* Jim Lee (born 1945)"]}, {"page": "Victoria and Albert Museum", "response": ["The collection includes the work of many photographers from Fox Talbot, Julia Margaret Cameron, Viscountess Clementina Hawarden, Gustave Le Gray, Benjamin Brecknell Turner, Frederick Hollyer, Samuel Bourne, Roger Fenton, Man Ray, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Ilse Bing, Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton (there are more than 8000 of his negatives), Don McCullin, David Bailey, Jim Lee and Helen Chadwick to the present day."]}, {"page": "Jim Lee (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jim Lee is a comic book artist.", "Jim Lee may also refer to:", "*Jim Lee (photographer), photographer and film director", "*Jim Lee (broadcaster), radio announcer", "*Jim Lee (record producer)", "*Jim Lee (businessman), see Trey Gowdy#Electoral history"]}, {"page": "Jim Lee (Photographer and Film Director)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jim Lee (photographer)"]}]}}
