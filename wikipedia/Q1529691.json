Burke won a total of eight caps for Wales, playing at half-back.\nBurke began his career with Wrexham Grosvenor, but moved on to Wrexham February and Wrexham Olympic before making a transfer to Liverpool Cambrians. From there, he was signed by Newton Heath in 1886. The club's parent company, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, was able to employ Burke as a painter \u2013 as was his trade \u2013 at the nearby Carriage and Wagon Works, from which the club had been born. In his first season at Newton Heath, Burke played mostly at left-half, but switched to right-half by the following season, and even played at centre-half or inside-right on occasion.\nWhen Burke's time at Newton Heath came to an end, after making 29 appearances for the Heathens, he moved back to Wrexham to play for Wrexham Victoria.\nHe died in 1914 at the age of 50 as a result of lead poisoning.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Burke", "response": ["Thomas Burke or Tom Burke may refer to:", "*Tom Burke (Australian politician) (1910\u20131973), Labor Party legislator for the Division of Perth", "*Tom Burke (priest) (1923\u20132008), Irish Carmelite priest, physicist and school teacher", "*Tom Burke (footballer, born 1862) (1862\u20131914), Welsh footballer", "*Tom Burke (hurler) (fl. 1865\u20131887), Irish hurler", "*Tom Burke (American football) (born 1976), American defensive end in National Football League", "*Tom Burke (Irish footballer), Ireland footballer", "*Tom Burke (actor) (born 1981), English television, film and stage actor", "*Tom Burke (environmentalist) (born 1938), British academic and writer on environmental policy issues"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["* First international: Jack Powell and Tom Burke for Wales against England (26 February 1887)"]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Newton Heath LYR F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Tom Burke"]}, {"page": "1887\u201388 Newton Heath LYR F.C. season", "response": ["As with the previous three seasons, the final was played at Whalley Range in south Manchester.
