He was unfortunate to feature on the losing side for the club in the 1891 FA Cup Final, having also finished as runner-up in the 1890 Scottish Cup Final with Vale of Leven. He was still playing for the Magpies in the 1893\u201394 season when they reached the showpiece event again, but this time did not take part as the club claimed victory (his former Vale of Leven teammate Daniel Bruce was on the field). He later returned to Scotland for a short spell with Clyde.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1891 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|MF || Archie Osborne  ||"]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RH |||| Archie Osborne"]}]}}
