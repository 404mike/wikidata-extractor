When he left school in 1949, he joined Birmingham City as a junior, and turned professional three years later. Described as a \"talented goalscorer\" but injury-prone, he scored on his debut in the Second Division on 8 September 1954 in a 4\u20130 win at home to Ipswich Town. He scored again two games later, but soon lost his place, and when the club signed the prolific Eddy Brown a few weeks later Warmington was reduced to covering for the inside trio of Noel Kinsey, Brown and Peter Murphy. He played occasionally at half-back, as he did in Birmingham's first match in the inaugural staging of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a goalless draw against Internazionale in Milan in May 1956 when Len Boyd and Roy Warhurst were injured. After playing only nine first-team games in his Birmingham career, Warmington dropped into non-league football in his native Worcestershire with Bromsgrove Rovers, Redditch United and Droitwich Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warmington", "response": ["* Peter Warmington (born 1934), English soccer player "]}, {"page": "Warmington, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Warmington"]}]}}
