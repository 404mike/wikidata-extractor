Eugenie, who did not wear any veil, wanted her scar from the scoliosis operation that she had undergone at the age of 12 to be revealed. The bride also wore a pair of diamond and emerald earrings, gifted to her by Brooksbank. The Queen lent her granddaughter the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, which was made in 1919 by Boucheron for Dame Margaret Greville and bequeathed by Mrs. Greville to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1942. It features \"brilliant and rose cut diamonds pav\u00e9 set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side\". For the customary bridal themes of \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\", Eugenie had her emerald drop earrings (the \"new\"), the Queen's tiara (the \"borrowed\"), and a handful of \"blue thistle flowers\" in her bouquet (the \"blue\"). Hairstylist Sonny-Jo MacFarlane styled Eugenie's hair in a \"loose chignon\". The bride wore shoes by Charlotte Olympia. Her bouquet, created by Patrice Van Helden Oakes, consisted of \"Lily of the Valley, Stephanotis pips, hints of baby blue thistles, white spray roses, trailing ivy, and sprigs of myrtle from Osborne House\". After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother. Bobbi Brown make-up artist Hannah Martin did Eugenie's make-up for the ceremony."]}]}}
