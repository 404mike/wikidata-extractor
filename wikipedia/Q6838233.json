He had a 12-year career in the Football League, making 174 league appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["Preparing for life in the Third Division, Lee released Ken Wookey, Stuart Shaw, Eric Magee, Stuart Chapman, and Gordon Logan. In their place he signed centre-half Roy Cross from Walsall, inside-forward Brian Horton from Hednesford Town, and full-back Mick Hopkinson from Mansfield Town. He steadied the ship in the midst of infighting in the boardroom, and the team went on a four-game winning streak in October that included a 2\u20130 win over fallen-giants Aston Villa. In January, he signed John Brodie from Northern Premier League side Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a3250, and noted that his team's performances were not helped by the 'boo boys' at Vale Park. Safety was assured with a 17th place, three points above relegated Reading.", "For the 1971\u201372 campaign he released Mick Hopkinson, John Green, and John King; and signed left-half John Flowers from Doncaster Rovers and full-back Tony Loska from Shrewsbury Town for 'a small fee'. Pre-season did not run smoothly however, as Lee fell out with Sammy Morgan, and had to contend with injuries to Roy Sproson, Stuart Sharratt, and top-scorer John James. Low attendances forced him to sell Clint Boulton to Torquay United for \u00a310,000. In December, he brought Ray Harford from Mansfield Town for a \u00a35,000 fee, as well as Keith Lindsey from Southend United for 'a small fee'. War in the boardroom continued, whilst only 2,809 turned up to see a 1\u20130 home win over Mansfield Town on 4 March. On 8 May, Sproson made his farewell competitive appearance for the club in front of only 2,743 supporters, and Lee angrily declared that \"the attendance was nothing short of a disgrace to mark the end of a legend\". Safety was assured with a 15h place finish, five points above relegated Mansfield Town."]}, {"page": "St Bede's Grammar School", "response": ["* Mick Hopkinson, canoeist, (first expedition to canoe down Everest)"]}, {"page": "Hopkinson", "response": ["* Mick Hopkinson (born 1942), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Michael Edward Hopkinson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mick Hopkinson"]}, {"page": "Michael Hopkinson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mick Hopkinson"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw the arrival of centre-half Roy Cross (Walsall); inside-forward Brian Horton (Hednesford Town); and full-back Mick Hopkinson (Mansfield Town).", "On the financial side, a profit of \u00a33,424 was made, the club's first profitable season since 1962\u201363.
