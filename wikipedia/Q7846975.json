Travis, harbouring reservations about the group's session with Troy Tate, gave Porter a cassette of the sessions beforehand in the hopes that he could remix them. Porter told Travis that the sessions were \"out of tune and out of time\". Feeling the Tate sessions were unsalvageable, Porter offered to re-record the album himself. Despite praising the work with Tate, only a week prior, to the press by stating \"we've done everything exactly right and it'll show\", Smiths singer Morrissey accepted (as did Travis), while Marr hesitantly agreed. Marr would later claim in his autobiography that when the band heard the finished work done under Tate, Morrissey didn't like the album and the others weren't entirely happy with the results either. \"I could hear myself that the mixes sounded underproduced and were not the finished article that we needed as our introduction to the world,\" Marr wrote. \"Why it was deemed necessary to scrap the album entirely rather than just mix it again I didn't know, but I wasn't going to make too much of it...it was a document of how the band really were at that point though...\"."]}, {"page": "The Teardrop Explodes", "response": ["The Teardrop Explodes were an English post-punk/neo-psychedelic band formed in Liverpool in 1978.

Gary Dwyer played drums on Cope's 1984 debut solo album World Shut Your Mouth, and would drum for The Colourfield in 1986 and Balcony Dogs in the late 1980s, but would subsequently leave music for a variety of jobs including fork-lift driver.

Some tracks featured a full group sound as featured on Kilimanjaro (most notably \"Passionate Friend\", the only single release and album track to feature the band's ill-fated US touring members Alfie Agius and Jeff Hammer) but in general the album broke away from the West Coast/beat group sound of the debut as well as having a noticeably more downbeat and troubled atmosphere.

Due to impending deadlines, the version that ultimately appeared on the band's first album The Smiths was a remix of the original master recording from the Strawberry Studios session. For this version, Porter increased the separation between Marr's guitar tracks and Morrissey's vocals, emphasised drummer Mike Joyce's drum beat, pushed Rourke's bass back in the mix, and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to the song.Goddard, p. 32"]}, {"page": "Virginia Astley", "response": ["It was during this early period that Astley started to give serious consideration to releasing her own material; however, nothing immediately came of these plans.
