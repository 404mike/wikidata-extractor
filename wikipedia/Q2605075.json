In addition to their proposed use on the beaches, the Germans later used them as tractors for antitank guns and munitions carriers, as self-propelled guns, and as armoured personnel carriers. There were two main types. The Renault UE Chenillette (German name: Infanterie Schlepper UE 630 (f)) was a light tracked armoured carrier and prime mover produced by France between 1932 and 1940. Five to six thousand were built, and about 3,000 were captured and overhauled by the Germans.Anthony Tucker-Jones, Hitler's Great Panzer Heist, Pen & Sword Books, 2007, pp. 59, 155 They had a storage compartment that could carry 350\u00a0kg, pull a trailer weighing 775\u00a0kg for a total of about 1000\u00a0kg, and could climb a 50% slope. The armour was 5\u20139\u00a0mm, enough to stop shell fragments and bullets. There was also the Lorraine 37L, which was larger, of which 360 fell into German hands. In that vehicle a load of 810 kilograms could be carried, plus a 690\u00a0kg trailer pulled for a total of 1.5 tonnes. The use of such captured equipment meant that the first wave divisions were largely motorised, with the first wave using 9.3% (4,200) of the 45,000 horses normally required.Peter Fleming says on page 229 that the number of horses was reduced to 4,200 for the first wave (466 per division) and 7,000 for the second wave.", "Although Operation Sea Lion was never attempted, there has been much speculation about its hypothetical outcome. The great majority of military historians, including Peter Fleming, Derek Robinson and Stephen Bungay, have expressed the opinion that it had little chance of success and would have most likely resulted in a disaster for the Germans. Fleming states it is doubtful whether history offers any better example of a victor so nearly offering his vanquished foe an opportunity of inflicting on him a resounding defeat. Len Deighton and some other writers have called the German amphibious plans a \"Dunkirk in reverse\".Deighton, Len (1980) Battle of Britain London: Jonathan Cape,  Robinson argues the massive superiority of the Royal Navy over the Kriegsmarine would have made Sea Lion a disaster. Dr Andrew Gordon, in an article for the Royal United Services Institute JournalRUSI Journal,  (retrieved 27 December 2017) agrees with this and is clear in his conclusion the German Navy was never in a position to mount Sealion, regardless of any realistic outcome of the Battle of Britain. In his fictional alternate history Invasion: the German invasion of England, July 1940, Kenneth Macksey proposes that the Germans might have succeeded if they had swiftly and decisively begun preparations even before the Dunkirk evacuations, and the Royal Navy for some reason had held back from large-scale intervention,Macksey 1990, pp. 144\u201346. though in practice the Germans were unprepared for such a speedy commencement of their assault.Macksey 1990, pp. 209\u201310 The German official naval war historian, Vice Admiral Kurt Assmann, wrote in 1958: \"Had the German Air Force defeated the Royal Air Force as decisively as it had defeated the French Air Force a few months earlier, I am sure Hitler would have given the order for the invasion to be launched \u2013 and the invasion would in all probability been smashed\"."]}, {"page": "Special Operations Executive", "response": ["Two years earlier, in April 1941, in a mission codenamed \"Yak\", Peter Fleming had attempted to recruit agents from among the many thousands of Italian prisoners of war captured in the Western Desert Campaign.

The Qing dynasty and the Kuomintang generally referred to the sedentary oasis-dwelling Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang as \"turban-headed Hui\" to differentiate them from other predominantly Muslim ethnicities in China. In the 1930s, foreigners travelers in Xinjiang such as George W. Hunter, Peter Fleming, Ella Maillart and Sven Hedin, referred to the Turkic Muslims of the region as \"Turki\" in their books. Use of the term Uyghur was unknown in Xinjiang until 1934. The area governor, Sheng Shicai, came to power, adopting the Soviet ethnographic classification instead of the Kuomintang's and became the first to promulgate the official use of the term \"Uyghur\" to describe the Turkic Muslims of Xinjiang. \"Uyghur\" replaced \"rag-head\"."]}, {"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["Other notable figures include Gertrude Bell, an explorer, archaeologist, mapper and spy, who, along with T.

The resulting character that she created, Mrs. Kay Miniver, proved a huge success from the character's inception in 1937, and the columns were subsequently published in book form in 1939. On the outbreak of war, this book became the basis for a patriotic and sentimental American film, Mrs. Miniver, released in 1942, which won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture."]}, {"page": "Manchukuo", "response": ["The British writer Peter Fleming visited Manchukuo in 1935, and while riding a train through the countryside of Manchukuo, a group of Japanese colonists mistook his Swiss traveling companion Kini for a Russian refugee, and began to beat her up. It was only after Fleming was able to prove to the Japanese that she was Swiss, not Russian, that the Japanese stopped and apologized, saying that they would never had beaten her up if they had known she was Swiss, saying that they sincerely believed she was a Russian when they assaulted her. Fleming observed that in Manchukuo: \"you can beat White Russians up till you are blue in the face, because they are people without status in the world, citizens of nowhere\". Fleming further noted that the Japanese in Manchukuo had a strong dislike of all white people, and because the Russians in Manchukuo were stateless without an embassy to issue protests if they were victimized, the Japanese liked to victimize them. Until World War II, the Japanese tended to leave alone those travelling to Manchukuo with a passport as they did not like to deal with protests from embassies in Tokyo about the mistreatment of their citizens. The Kwantung Army operated a secret biological-chemical warfare unit based in Pinfang, Unit 731, that performed gruesome experiments on people involving much visceration of the subjects to see the effects of chemicals and germs on the human body. In the late 1930s, the doctors of Unit 731 demanded more white subjects to experiment upon in order to test the efficiency the strains of anthrax and plague that they were developing leading to a great many of the Russians living in Manchukuo becoming the unwilling human guinea pigs of Unit 731. The Russian Fascist Party, which worked with the Japanese was used to kidnap various \"unreliable\" Russians living in Manchukuo for Unit 731 to experiment upon."]}, {"page": "Evelyn Waugh", "response": ["By 1953, Waugh's popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the Zeitgeist, and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available.

Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.Patey, p. 324 Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.Amory (ed.), p. 415 Peter Fleming in The Spectator likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\"."]}, {"page": "The Spectator", "response": ["In 1975 Creighton sold The Spectator to Henry Keswick, again for \u00a375,000 (Creighton sold the 99 Gower Street premises separately, so the magazine moved to 56 Doughty Street).

His article, in a learned Finnish journal and with an illustrative glossary, used  The Pursuit of Love  to exemplify upper-class speech patterns.Hastings, pp. 223\u201325 In a spirit of mischief, Mitford incorporated the U and Non-U thesis into an article she was writing for Encounter on the English aristocracy. Although the aspect formed only a small section of Mitford's article, when it was published in September 1955 it caused a major stir. Few recognised the tongue-in-cheek aspect. Mitford received hundreds of letters from worried readers desperate to know if they were snobs or merely \"common\". The level of anxious or amused interest was sustained to such an extent that in 1956 Hamish Hamilton reproduced the article in a short book, Noblesse Oblige. The book also included an abbreviated version of Ross's original article, and contributions from Waugh, Betjeman, Peter Fleming and Christopher Sykes,Acton, p. 99 It was a tremendous success; as Lovell records, \"'U and Non-U' was the buzz phrase of the day\u00a0...

The journey started in February 1935 and took seven months to complete, involving travel by train, on lorries, on foot, horse and camelback. Their objective was to ascertain what was happening in Xinjiang (then also known as Sinkiang or Chinese Turkestan) where the Kumul Rebellion had just ended.
