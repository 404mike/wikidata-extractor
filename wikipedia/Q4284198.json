The Curator of the Hereford Club, Dr. H. G. Bull, convinced the members in 1867 to undertake the particular study of mushrooms. While the mycological efforts of the Club diminished somewhat after Dr. Bull's death, the Union of Yorkshire founded its  Mycological Committee in 1892. This Committee attracted the involvement of many eminent mycologists including Mordecai Cubitt Cooke (1825\u20131914), Carleton Rea (1861\u20131946), George Edward Massee (1850\u20131917), Charles Bagge Plowright (1849\u20131910), and others. Mycologist Kathleen Sampson was a member for sixty years, as well as serving as president in 1938."]}, {"page": "Baorangia bicolor", "response": ["Baorangia bicolor was originally named in 1807 by the Italian botanist Giuseppe Raddi. American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named a species collected in Sandlake, New York, in 1870, Boletus bicolor. Although this naming is considered illegitimate due to article 53.1 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Peck is still given as the authority in the Bessette et al. (2000) monograph of North American boletes.  Boletus bicolor (Raddi) is not a synonym of \"Boletus bicolor\" Peck.  Peck's Boletus bicolor describes the Eastern North American species that is the familiar \"two-colored bolete\", while Raddi's Boletus bicolor describes a separate European species that is lost to science.  This taxonomic conflict has yet to be resolved. In 1909 a species found in Singapore was named Boletus bicolor by George Edward Massee; this naming is illegitimate and is synonymous with Boletochaete bicolor according to Singer. Molecular studies found that Boletus bicolor was not closely related to the type species of Boletus, Boletus edulis, and in 2015 Alfredo Vizzini transferred Boletus bicolor to the genus Baorangia. The original botanical name for this two-colored bolete was derived from the Latin words b\u014dl\u0113tus, meaning \"mushroom\", and bicolor, meaning \"having two colors.\""]}, {"page": "Sarcoscypha coccinea", "response": ["S.\u00a0coccinea var. jurana was described by Jean Boudier (1903) as a variety of the species having a brighter and more orange-colored fruit body, and with flattened or blunt-ended ascospores.

George Edward Massee transferred it to the genus Gyrophragmium in 1891, because of its resemblance to the species Gyrophragmium delilei, and because he felt that the structure of the volva as well as the internal morphology of the gleba excluded it from Secotium. In 1916, William Murrill listed the species in Gymnopus, but did not explain the reason for the generic transfer. In a 1943 publication, Sanford Zeller compared a number of similar secotioid genera: Galeropsis, Gyrophragmium and Montagnea. He concluded that the species did not fit in the limits set for the genus Gyrophragmium and so created the new genus Longia with Longia texensis as the type species. The generic name was to honor William Henry Long, an American mycologist noted for his work in describing Gasteromycetes. Zeller also mentioned two additional synonyms: Secotium decipiens (Peck, 1895), and Podaxon strobilaceous (Copeland, 1904)."]}]}}
