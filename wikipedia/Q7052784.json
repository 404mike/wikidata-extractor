Testi then entered discussions with Trident Studios' Norman Sheffield, who offered the band a management deal under Neptune Productions, a subsidiary of Trident, to manage the band and enable them to use their facilities, whilst the management searched for a deal. This suited both parties, as Trident were expanding into management, and under the deal, Queen were able to make use of the hi-tech recording facilities used by signed musicians. Taylor later described these early off-peak studio hours as \"gold dust\"."]}, {"page": "Hey Jude", "response": ["The Beatles recorded the master track for \"Hey Jude\" at Trident, where McCartney and Harrison had each produced sessions for their Apple artists, on 31 July. Trident's founder, Norman Sheffield, recalled that Mal Evans, the Beatles' aide and former roadie, insisted that some marijuana plants he had brought be placed in the studio to make the place \"soft\", consistent with the band's wishes. Barry Sheffield served as recording engineer for the session. The line-up on the basic track was McCartney on piano and lead vocal, Lennon on acoustic guitar, Harrison on electric guitar, and Ringo Starr on drums. The Beatles recorded four takes of \"Hey Jude\", the first of which was selected as the master. With drums intended to be absent for the first two verses, McCartney began this take unaware that Starr had just left for a toilet break. Starr soon returned \u2013 \"tiptoeing past my back rather quickly\", in McCartney's recollection \u2013 and performed his cue perfectly.", "On 1 August, the group carried out overdubs on the basic track, again at Trident. These additions included McCartney's lead vocal and bass guitar; backing vocals from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison; and tambourine, played by Starr. McCartney's vocal over the long coda, starting at around three minutes into the song, included a series of improvised shrieks that he later described as \"Cary Grant on heat!\" They then added a 36-piece orchestra over the coda, scored by Martin. The orchestra consisted of ten violins, three violas, three cellos, two flutes, one contra bassoon, one bassoon, two clarinets, one contra bass clarinet, four trumpets, four trombones, two horns, percussion and two string basses. According to Norman Sheffield, there was dissension initially among the orchestral musicians, some of whom \"were looking down their noses at the Beatles, I think\". Sheffield recalls that McCartney ensured their cooperation by demanding: \"Do you guys want to get fucking paid or not?\" During the first few takes, McCartney was unhappy about the lack of energy and passion in the orchestra's performance, so he stood up on the grand piano and started conducting the musicians from there."]}, {"page": "A Night at the Opera (Queen album)", "response": ["Queen's previous album, Sheer Heart Attack (1974), had obtained commercial success and brought the band mainstream attention, with the single \"Killer Queen\" reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart, as well as providing the band with their first top 20 hit in the United States.Whitburn, Joel (2006). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. Billboard BooksRoberts, David (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums. London: Guinness World Records Limited However, despite this success, the band was broke at the time, largely due to a contract they had signed which meant that they would produce albums for a production company, who would then sell the album to a record label, which Brian May later described as \"probably the worst thing we ever did.\"Sheer Heart Attack & Killer Queen \u2013 Days Of Our Lives Documentary Queen Official.

Their finances were in such a poor state that Roger Taylor was warned not to drum too hard, as they were unable to afford new drumsticks. The matter eventually reached a turning point when John Deacon, who had recently married, was denied a cash advance of \u00a34,000 by manager Norman Sheffield to put a deposit on a house. This increasing frustration led to Freddie Mercury writing the song \"Death on Two Legs\", which would serve as the opening track to A Night at the Opera.", "\"Death on Two Legs\" can be referred to as Freddie Mercury's hate letter to Queen's first manager, Norman Sheffield, who for some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager from 1972 to 1975.

Trident also agreed to oversee the group's management, recording and publishing interests while they sought a record deal. One day, while waiting to use the studio, Mercury was asked to record vocals by producer Robin Geoffrey Cable, who was working on a version of \"I Can Hear Music\" and \"Goin' Back\".
