The confidence of Georges Carpentier was that Jacovacci was capable of winning decisively under six-rounds. Johnson went the full fifteen-rounds, in front of 7,000 spectators in Manchester, and defeated Jacovacci via a points decision awarded by referee Joe Bowker. The crowd was the largest Manchester had ever seen at a tournament. In the early rounds of the contest, Jacovacci boxed at a hurricane rate, showering blows from all angles. He forced the battle, but Johnson's calm skill made him miss many times. Jacovacci took a tremendous lot out of himself, but he was unable to land a telling blow, although in the fourth-round he cut open Johnson's left eyebrow. This however, acted as a tonic on Johnson, and he became far more aggressive, applying to the body as well as to the head. The sustained efforts of Jacovacci tired him, and then it was then when Johnson came into his own. He boxed calmly and with deliberation, carefully scoring at every conceivable opportunity.
