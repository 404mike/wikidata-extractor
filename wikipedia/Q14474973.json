In the Strategy paper the examiner, J. F. C. Fuller, awarded him 1,000 marks out of a possible 1,000. The advantage of gaining the p.s.c. (passed Staff College) was that the two-year course provided a network of 180 highly trained officers for help afterwards. By arriving with such a splash, it is probable that Dorman-Smith became regarded with suspicion by people who would one day be his peers and superior officers.Greacen pp. 96\u20137 Many of Dorman-Smith's fellow students there included the future general officers of the Second World War, including Philip Christison, Evelyn Barker, Oliver Leese, Eric Hayes, John Hawkesworth, Ronald Penney, John Whiteley, Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman, Eric Nares, Charles Norman, Stanley Kirby, Wilfrid Lloyd, Reginald Savory and Clement West.Smart, p. 88"]}, {"page": "William Bridgeman, 1st Viscount Bridgeman", "response": ["*Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman (1896\u20131982)"]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire", "response": ["*Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman 3 August 1951 \u2013 20 March 1970"]}, {"page": "Bridgeman", "response": ["*Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman"]}, {"page": "Robert Clive Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Bridgeman, 2nd Viscount Bridgeman"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Bridgeman", "response": ["Mary died in 1961 and Bridgeman survived her until 1974.
