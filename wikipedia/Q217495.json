Her first published novel, Under the Net (1954), was selected in 1998 as one of Modern Library's 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Her 1978 novel The Sea, the Sea won the Booker Prize. In 1987, she was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II for services to literature. In 2008, The Times ranked Murdoch twelfth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".Her other books include The Bell (1958), A Severed Head (1961), The Red and the Green (1965), The Nice and the Good (1968), The Black Prince (1973), Henry and Cato (1976), The Philosopher's Pupil (1983), The Good Apprentice (1985), The Book and the Brotherhood (1987), The Message to the Planet (1989), and The Green Knight (1993).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andromeda (mythology)", "response": ["* In her novel The Sea, the Sea (1978), Iris Murdoch uses the Andromeda myth, as presented in a reproduction of Titian's painting Perseus and Andromeda, to reflect the character and motives of her characters"]}, {"page": "Booker Prize", "response": ["!

He became closely involved with the painter Marie-Louise von Motesiczky, who was to remain a close companion for many years. His name has also been linked with the author Iris Murdoch (see John Bayley's Iris, A Memoir of Iris Murdoch, which has several references to an author, referred to as \"the Dichter\", who was a Nobel Laureate and whose works included Die Blendung [English title Auto-da-F\u00e9])."]}, {"page": "Easter Rising", "response": ["* The Red and the Green is a 1965 novel by Iris Murdoch that covers the events leading up to and during the Easter Rising."]}, {"page": "February 8", "response": ["*1999 \u2013 Iris Murdoch, Irish-born British novelist and philosopher (b. 1919)"]}, {"page": "Hamlet", "response": ["Hamlet is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature, with a story capable of \"seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others\".

It has inspired many other writers\u2014from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch\u2014and has been described as \"the world's most filmed story after Cinderella\".", "In the 1920s, James Joyce managed \"a more upbeat version\" of Hamlet\u2014stripped of obsession and revenge\u2014in Ulysses, though its main parallels are with Homer's Odyssey. In the 1990s, two novelists were explicitly influenced by Hamlet. In Angela Carter's Wise Children, To be or not to be is reworked as a song and dance routine, and Iris Murdoch's The Black Prince has Oedipal themes and murder intertwined with a love affair between a Hamlet-obsessed writer, Bradley Pearson, and the daughter of his rival. In the late 20th century, David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest draws heavily from Hamlet and takes its title from the play's text; Wallace incorporates references to the gravedigger scene, the marriage of the main character's mother to his uncle, and the re-appearance of the main character's father as a ghost."]}, {"page": "July 15", "response": ["*  1919   \u2013 Iris Murdoch, Anglo-Irish British novelist and philosopher (d. 1999)"]}, {"page": "Kingsley Amis", "response": ["Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Amis regularly produced essays and criticism, principally for periodical publication.

The project was filmed over four weeks and allowed Winslet to bring her daughter, who was six months old at the time, on set.

Winslet's third film release of 2001 was the animated film Christmas Carol: The Movie, based on Charles Dickens' novel. For the film's soundtrack she recorded \"What If\", which proved to be a commercial hit. After a year-long absence from the screen, Winslet starred as a headstrong journalist interviewing a professor on death row in the thriller The Life of David Gale (2003).
