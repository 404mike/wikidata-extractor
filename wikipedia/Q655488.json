A product of the Scottish Highland Football League, Coutts' first senior professional club was his home town club, Cove Rangers who are located 4 miles south of Aberdeen. In 2008, Coutts transferred into the English Football League joining Peterborough United. He then moved to Preston North End in 2010 before joining Derby County in 2012. In January 2015, he signed for Sheffield United.

This was after his first penalty back in a Preston shirt was saved by Exeter's Artur Krysiak, and before his third was saved by Lee Butcher of Leyton Orient. His next penalty came in a penalty shootout against Rochdale in the Football League Trophy, which was slotted into the top corner after he was brought on as a substitute for Conor McLaughlin especially to take a penalty in the shootout. However, he missed his next penalty, again in the Football League Trophy, and again in a penalty shootout, this time against Chesterfield. He was the third Preston player to take a penalty in this shootout, and he blazed it over the bar, much to the disbelief of the fans. Preston's next penalty-taker, Paul Coutts, had his penalty saved, and then when the next penalty was scored by Chesterfield's Alexandre Mendy, Preston got knocked out of the tournament. Alexander started the next league game against Stevenage but was replaced through injury by Steven Smith after just 3 minutes, after which Alexander did not feature for the Lilywhites for a long time, and there was speculation that he had played his last game for Preston, and in his career."]}, {"page": "Craig Bryson", "response": ["Ahead of the 2013\u201314 season, Bryson was expected to compete with Paul Coutts, Jeff Hendrick and Will Hughes for a central midfield role.

In the event of the season, Bryson was an ever-present in the starting line-up in the league until the 32nd fixture."]}, {"page": "Conor Sammon", "response": ["Sammon ended his drought with a brace in a 3\u20132 win against Birmingham City on 24 November and put his improvement of form down to his regaining confidence. Early in the new year, he went on a ten-game goal drought and fans became frustrated with his performances after missing an 87th-minute penalty in Derby's 1\u20130 home loss to Crystal Palace on 1 March. In the next game however he scored his eighth goal of the season in a 1\u20131 draw at league leaders Cardiff City, and expressed frustration at his lack of goals but belief in his ability to score more despite the negative chants from the crowd.  In Derby's game at Leeds United on 1 April, Sammon had a goal ruled out for offside at 0\u20130 and missed a penalty on 73 minutes with Derby losing 1\u20130. He struck the post before Paul Coutts scored on the rebound, Derby eventually winning 2\u20131. He ended an eleven-match goalless streak (9 for Derby, 2 for Ireland) with an 85th-minute winner against Millwall on the final day of the season. It was only Sammon's third league goal of 2013. However, despite the criticism from supporters, Sammon was named the 61st best player in the 2012\u201313 Football League Championship by the Actim Index."]}, {"page": "Chris Basham", "response": ["In the 2016\u201317 season, Basham continued to be in the first team regular at the club following the arrival of Manager Chris Wilder and played in the midfield position. Basham then scored his first goal of the season, but was later sent-off in the second half, in a 2\u20132 draw against Scunthorpe United on 24 September 2016. After serving a three match suspension, Basham returned to the first team, on 18 October 2016, making his first start from suspension, in a 3\u20130 win against Shrewsbury Town, followed up by scoring in the next game, in a 3\u20133 draw against Bradford City. Two weeks later, on 6 November 2016, Basham scored and set up one of the goals, in a 6\u20130 win over Leyton Orient in the first round of the FA Cup. Due to his impressive performance at the club, Manager Wilder hinted that Basham could be earning a new contract, with a year to his contract left. As the 2016\u201317 season progressed, Basham began to play in the defense, as a centre-back, partnering with either Jack O'Connell, Ethan Ebanks-Landell and Jake Wright. Around the same time, Basham played in the midfield position, with Paul Coutts. Then, in a 3\u20130 win over Port Vale on 14 April 2017, Basham produced an impressive display when he set up two goals. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, which saw Sheffield United promoted to Championship after six seasons in League One, Basham went on to make 48 appearances and scoring two times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["|1 February 2010 ||  Paul Coutts || Peterborough United || Undisclosed"]}, {"page": "Coutts (surname)", "response": ["*Paul Coutts, Scottish association football player for Fleetwood Town"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Preston North End F.C. season", "response": ["| Paul Coutts"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Football League One", "response": ["|  Paul Coutts"]}, {"page": "Jeff Hendrick", "response": ["Ahead of the 2013\u201314 season, Hendrick was set to compete with Craig Bryson, Paul Coutts and Will Hughes for a starting berth, with Clough stating that rotation could be utilised.
