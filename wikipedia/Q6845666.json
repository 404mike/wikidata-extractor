The band initially set a fundraising goal of $50,000, expecting it to take about two months to raise that amount. Instead, fans contributed more than $50,000 in less than 20 hours. When the Kickstarter campaign finally came to a close, they had raised a total of $264,762.

In 2010, Eamon moved to Los Angeles, California to hone his craft as a songwriter and work with a fresh group of producers. In 2011, Eamon signed with SMC Entertainment, a publicly traded independent record label. Eamon signed a two-album deal worth $1,000,000 and began recording with Grammy winning producer Mikal Blue (Colbie Caillat, Jason Mraz, OneRepublic). SMC was almost immediately delinquent on payments for musicians, studio costs, and advances. Eamon and Mikal Blue continued to record the album in spite of SMC not fulfilling their contractual obligation. Legal action was taken at the end of 2012 to resolve the issue. At that point, SMC financial backer David Levy was arrested for stock fraud. It gave Eamon more leverage in the litigation, but not enough to get him out of his contract. Levy was later sentenced to nine years in prison in 2013. The album was finished in September 2012, and Eamon was still under contract with SMC, but could not release any music or perform for money. He could, however, collaborate with other artists. Eamon joined forces with R.A. the Rugged Man on the rapper's 2013 album Legends Never Die. Eamon is featured on two songs: \"Luv to Fuk\" and \"Still Get Through the Day\". A video for \"Still Get Through the Day\" came out on February 4, 2014.
