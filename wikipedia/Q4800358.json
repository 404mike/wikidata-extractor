He founded the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft and designed their headquarters in Great Charles Street. The building is still extant, but converted to offices.He also designed the Romanesque style, brick-built Church of St John & St Basil (1910\u20131911) in Heath Mill Lane in Birmingham's Digbeth district (52.4769\u00b0N 1.8813\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.4769; -1.8813\ufeff (Church of St John & St Basil)). It was described by Nicholas Pevsner as \"the finest example of his Arts and Crafts primitivism\". A further church design was St Andrew's Church, Barnt Green, Worcestershire (52.3604\u00b0N 1.9880\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.3604; -1.9880\ufeff (St Andrew\u2019s Church, Barnt Green)).\n\nIn 1917, he was commissioned to design Seoul Anglican Cathedral in Korea; construction began in 1922 but was only completed in 1996 after the original plans were rediscovered.In 1923, along with Holland W. Hobbiss he helped to design the rebuild of St Giles Church, Rowley Regis, after it was burned downed. It is the 4th building on that site.\nHis son James, serving in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment during World War I, was killed aged 22.Pevsner described Dixon as \"an Anglo-Catholic Socialist who associated Gothic with establishment conservatism and dreary Anglican piety\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Architecture of Birmingham", "response": ["The early 1890s saw a sudden change in Birmingham's dominant architectural style, as High Gothic gave way to a distinctive local school of Arts and Crafts architecture. Buildings came increasingly to be designed in an understated style that limited ornament and was based on traditional forms of local vernacular architecture, in Birmingham largely brick, roughcast and half-timbering. Design emphasised the simple and honest expression of the building's construction, highlighting structural elements such as the bonds of the brickwork, and often emphasising differences in the function of elements of the building through the deliberate creation of awkward juxtapositions and contrasts. Buildings often featured decorative elements such as furnishings, friezes or paintings by local artists and craftsmen \u2013 particularly by the Birmingham Group which formed around the Birmingham School of Art in the 1880s \u2013 considering these to be integral to the design of the building to form a \"total work of art\".  The Arts and Crafts philosophy was an approach to design rather than a defined style, however, and the work of Arts and Crafts architects within Birmingham ranged from the eclectic and spectacular Elizabethan revival work of Crouch and Butler to the Methodist purism of Joseph Lancaster Ball; and from the politically radical austerity of Arthur Stansfield Dixon; to the mystically-charged symbolism of the work of William Lethaby.", "File:Birmingham Guild of Handicraft, Great Charles Street - Arthur Stansfield Dixon.jpg|Birmingham Guild of Handicraft by Arthur Stansfield Dixon, 1898."]}, {"page": "Birmingham Guild of Handicraft", "response": ["It began as a loose part of the Birmingham Kyrle Society, then became a more fully formed group within the Kyrle Society in 1890, under the leadership of the silversmith and architect Arthur Stansfield Dixon (1856\u20131929) and with the lawyer Montague Fordham as first director, in Vittoria Street School for jewellers and silversmiths. In 1895, the Guild set up as an independent workshop and limited company with the guidance of Edward R. Taylor, who was an important figure in the history of Birmingham School of Art. William Kenrick, the local MP and an Arts and Crafts enthusiast, became a director. The Guild's first address was at Kyrle Hall, Sheep Street, the same studios later being taken over by John Paul Cooper. In 1898, the Guild moved to 44-5 Great Charles Street. The Guild produced furniture and metalware, taking special advantage of the switch to electric lighting and the consequent need for new light fittings.
