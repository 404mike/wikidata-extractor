He founded the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft and designed their headquarters in Great Charles Street. The building is still extant, but converted to offices.He also designed the Romanesque style, brick-built Church of St John & St Basil (1910\u20131911) in Heath Mill Lane in Birmingham's Digbeth district (52.4769\u00b0N 1.8813\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.4769; -1.8813\ufeff (Church of St John & St Basil)). It was described by Nicholas Pevsner as \"the finest example of his Arts and Crafts primitivism\". A further church design was St Andrew's Church, Barnt Green, Worcestershire (52.3604\u00b0N 1.9880\u00b0W\ufeff / 52.3604; -1.9880\ufeff (St Andrew\u2019s Church, Barnt Green)).\n\nIn 1917, he was commissioned to design Seoul Anglican Cathedral in Korea; construction began in 1922 but was only completed in 1996 after the original plans were rediscovered.In 1923, along with Holland W. Hobbiss he helped to design the rebuild of St Giles Church, Rowley Regis, after it was burned downed. It is the 4th building on that site.\nHis son James, serving in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment during World War I, was killed aged 22.Pevsner described Dixon as \"an Anglo-Catholic Socialist who associated Gothic with establishment conservatism and dreary Anglican piety\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
