In the mid-20th century, historian A. J. P. Taylor called the surviving stretch of Roman wall \"the least interesting Roman remains in Britain\".Nevell (2008), p.\u00a019. The first excavation of the vicus was carried out in the 1970s under Professor Barri Jones. In 1982 the fort, along with the rest of the Castlefield area, became the United Kingdom's first Urban Heritage Park,Woodside et al. (2004), p.\u00a0286. and partial reconstructions of the forts walls, including the ramparts and gateways, were opened in 1984. In 2001\u201305 the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit carried out excavations in the vicus to further investigate the site before the area underwent any more regeneration or reconstruction. The archaeological investigation of Mamucium Roman fort and its associated civilian settlement has, so far, provided approximately 10,000 artefacts."]}, {"page": "John Bryan Ward-Perkins", "response": ["In the 1950s his interest focused on the technical aspects of Roman construction and resulted in The Shrine of St Peter and the Vatican Excavations (1956) and David Talbot Rice's The Great Palace of the Byzantine Emperors (1958).

He served as visiting professor in numerous institutions, including New York University (1957) and as Rhind Lecturer in Edinburgh in 1960. In 1970 he wrote the Roman section of the prestigious Pelican History of Art volume on Etruscan and Roman architecture, co-authored with Axel Bo\u00ebthius. His students included the art historian Roger Ling, archaeologist Timothy W. Potter, and ancient historian Barri Jones.
