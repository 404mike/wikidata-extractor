(1890\u20131967) was an Anglican priest as well as being the headmaster of The King's School, Canterbury, a fee paying school, from 1935 to 1962.\nHe was educated St Edmund Hall, Oxford, and London. He married his wife in 1926 and their daughter became the first and, at the time, the only girl in the school.\nWhen Shirley took over the Headmastership of the King's School, Canterbury, in 1935, bankruptcy was close: the school had debts of \u00a340,000 - \u00a360,000 and was making an annual loss of \u00a36,000. He was at the same time appointed a Residentiary Canon of Canterbury Cathedral in whose precincts the School is situated.\nWhen Shirley was appointed, he had been headmaster of Worksop College for fourteen years. Controversially, on being appointed to King's, he persuaded the parents of about 30 Worksop boys to send them with him to Canterbury. This move is sometimes called the \"rape of Worksop\" and it resulted in Shirley's suspension from the Headmasters' Conference.\nShirley was known to the boys as \"Fred\" and his normal form of address to them was \"m'dear\". One boy kept cigarettes in strictest secrecy in the breast pocket of his jacket. Shirley came up to him one day. \"Keep 'em there, do you?\" he murmured, tapping his breast pocket.\nIn 1936, Shirley persuaded the writer Somerset Maugham to visit and eventually to be a benefactor to the school. Maugham had savaged the school in Of Human Bondage. Shirley persuaded him that all schools of the 1880s had been more or less as barbaric. Maugham's ashes are buried in the Cathedral Precincts.\nShirley manoeuvred against Dr Hewlett Johnson, the \"Red Dean\" who was ex-officio the Chairman of Governors. When the Dean put up a huge blue and white banner across the front of the Deanery which read \"Christians Ban Nuclear Weapons\", some of the boys by way of ripost, put up a banner on one of the school's buildings which read, \"King's Ban Communists\".\nFred had his detractors. However, to those who attracted his attention he was the epitome of kindness including ensuring that the fees of pupils whose fee paying parent or guardian died were met by the school. During the 1950s Kings achieved between a regular 18-20 Oxbridge Scholarships and Exhibitions. Most of his pupils considered him a leader of men. \nWith public examinations being set earlier and earlier, Shirley founded King's Week as a means of keeping the school together. It is a remarkable festival of music, drama, exhibitions and other fringe activities, which is still an annual event.\nFollowing Shirley's retirement in 1962, the school's Great Hall (which he had built) was renamed the Shirley Hall by Peter Newell, his successor as Headmaster. The building of the Great Hall was Fred's inspiration. There was no money. All of the pupils in the 1950s were required to sell a \"brick\" to parents and friends. They did. It was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. To the impertinent, it was known as \"Fred's Shed\".\nAmong his pupils were the former minister Tristan Garel-Jones and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s adviser, Sir Charles Powell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The King's School, Canterbury", "response": ["*Shirley Hall: School Assemblies and Examination Hall; formerly known as the Great Hall, renamed after the former headmaster, Fred Shirley", "*Full Canterbury Dress: The name given to the school uniform, which consists of a white shirt with wing collar, black waistcoat, pinstripe trousers, black jacket, black socks, black tie and black shoes for the boys.

When he came to the School, Fred Shirley, Headmaster (1935\u20131962), updated the school uniform to sports jackets but within a year, the boys had asked to revert to their traditional garb. He tried again after the War when the School returned to Canterbury, this time taking a vote on the matter but despite the difficulty in finding outmoded clothing in a time of clothes rationing, the boys once again decided to revert to tradition. In the mid-twentieth century, there were elaborate customs relating to such matters as buttons and the angle at which a boater was worn.

The land on which the school was built was donated by Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle, and the drive, which is now tree-lined, was donated by the Duke of Portland. In the early days, buildings were scarce, with only the Great Hall and East Wing complete, plus a temporary chapel. St Cuthbert's Chapel was opened in 1909 after Lord Mountgarret made funds available. Mountgarret did not live to see the finished building; the new building was opened in 1909 by Lady Mountgarret.
