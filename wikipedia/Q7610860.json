This vessel went round the coast of Britain, transmitting music on records and advertisements for the Daily Mail, from just outside territorial waters, an early precursor of the 1960s \"pirate radio\" ships..\nThe broadcasting yacht had been the idea of the paper's Circulation and Publicity Director, Valentine Smith, who soon transferred to the Sunday Referee, where he gave Williams a job with the idea of involving the paper in commercial broadcasting. They were soon in contact with Captain Leonard F. Plugge, who was starting the International Broadcasting Company (IBC).At the beginning of 1932, Williams was sent to France to join Max Staniforth at the IBC's new Radio Normandy service, broadcasting to the south of England.Recordings of two commercials read by Stephen Williams on Radio Normandy in 1932 are said to survive.Stephen Williams moved on to a rival company to IBC, Radio Publicity, which started broadcasting to the UK from Radio Paris, then a much more powerful station than Radio Normandy, which rapidly gained a large British audience. But French listeners complained that their most popular station was now too dominated by English programmes, so Radio Publicity turned to the newly created Radio Luxembourg, where it was able to gain the sole concession for English programmes.In December 1933, Williams thus became the first English radio presenter in Luxembourg as well as serving as manager of the station.\nShortly before his death in 1994, Williams gave an interview to Roger Bickerton about his work at Radio Luxembourg which was published in The Historic Record and AV Collector, Issues 39,40 and 41, April, June & October 1996.Radio Luxembourg closed down on the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Stephen Williams resumed his duties there when the station restarted in 1946. He left Luxembourg in 1948, and worked until 1975 as a freelance broadcaster.\nWhen, on 1 January 1992, Radio Luxembourg's English service closed down as a terrestrial radio station, the last words heard, \"Good luck, good listening ... and goodbye\" were spoken by 83-year-old Stephen Williams, who had been the first person ever to say on the air \"This is Radio Luxembourg\" over 58 years earlier.Williams was awarded the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by the Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1992.\nHe collected a large archive of material related to Radio Luxembourg, much of which his widow has donated to the Centre for Luxembourg Studies at Sheffield University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RTL (French radio)", "response": ["On 14 January 1933 experimental broadcasts by Radio Luxembourg began at 1191 m\u00e8tres (200\u00a0kW), an unauthorized wavelength, from the longwave transmitter at Junglinster.

Radio Luxembourg broadcast each evening from 19:00 to 23:00, in German, French and Dutch and was therefore the only French-language private broadcaster available in France and Belgium.

In December 1933, Radio Publicity (London) transferred 23-year-old Stephen Williams from directing its English-language programmes transmitted over Radio Paris to become the first manager of the English-language service of Radio Luxembourg.

Williams soon left the station and Everitt found himself in charge of a small on-air staff of three women and one man. Because of the dearth of advertising available in English, the early morning shows on long wave quickly disappeared and made way for French-language programmes.
