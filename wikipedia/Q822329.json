A diverse range of individuals including Arthur Schopenhauer, Karl Marx, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, Franz Rosenzweig, Eric Voegelin and A. J. Ayer have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th-century German group known as the Young Hegelians, which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian British idealism school (members of which included Francis Herbert Bradley, Bernard Bosanquet and in the United States Josiah Royce) was challenged and rejected by analytic philosophers Moore and Russell. In particular, Russell considered \"almost all\" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.B. Russell, History of Western Philosophy, chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701. Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented: \"Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance\".Russell, 735. Logical positivists such as Ayer and the Vienna Circle criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley."]}, {"page": "June 14", "response": ["*1848 \u2013 Bernard Bosanquet, English philosopher and theorist (d. 1923)"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)"]}]}}
