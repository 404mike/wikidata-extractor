At 21:00 on the evening of 23 April a force of eight boats with 150 officers and men from Nymphe and Blossom set out to capture her. Unfortunately, a strong ebb tide fed by heavy rains set in, slowing their approach and it was not until 02:30 that the boats of Nymphe reached the brig. Captain Shipley led the boarders, climbing the fore-rigging and attempting to cut away the boarding-netting, but he was shot and fell into the river. His brother, Charles Shipley, serving as a volunteer, immediately ordered the gig to pick him up, but the boats fell afoul of each other and became entangled with a caulking stage moored astern. Having lost the element of surprise, and with the boats of Blossom failing to reach the brig, the enterprise was abandoned. As well as her captain, Nymphe lost a seaman, and one marine was wounded. Captain Shipley's body was later recovered and it was evident that he had been killed instantly by a musket ball through the forehead. Commander Pigot was appointed by Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, the commander-in-chief on the coast of Portugal, to be Captain Shipley's successor on board Nymphe; and on 17 September he was confirmed in his post-rank. Captain The Hon. Josceline Percy, was later appointed to command her, while operating off the coast of Spain."]}, {"page": "Josceline", "response": ["*Josceline Percy (Royal Navy officer) (1784\u20131856), Royal Navy officer who went on to be Commander-in-Chief", "*Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644\u20131670), of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland and Petworth House, Sussex, an English peer", "*Lord Josceline Percy (1811\u20131881), British Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "1831 Coronation Honours", "response": ["*Captain the Honourable Josceline Percy"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Hon.
