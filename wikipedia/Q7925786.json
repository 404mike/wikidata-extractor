Cannings was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace.\nCannings made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Northamptonshire in the 1947 County Championship, where on debut Cannings took two wickets for 19 runs in Northamptonshire's second innings.\nFrom 1947 to 1949 Cannings represented Warwickshire in 53 first-class matches. In his debut season of 1947, he took 63 wickets at a bowling average of 29.57, with best figures of 5\u201349, which was one of his three five wicket hauls for the club during that season. Thereafter, in the 1948 and 1949 seasons Cannings struggled to take wickets, playing his last first-class match for Warwickshire against Somerset.\nIn his 53 first-class matches for Warwickshire, Cannings scored 745 runs at an average of 14.32, including his only first-class half century which yielded him highest first-class score of 61. With the ball Cannings took 88 wickets at an average of 31.11, with best figures of 5\u201349 and three five wicket hauls, all coming in his debut season for the county.\nIn 1950 Cannings joined the county of his birth, Hampshire. Cannings made his first-class debut for the club against Middlesex. In his debut season Cannings' bowling was revitalised, and he took 83 wickets at 24.32, with his career best figures of 7\u201352 coming as he made three five wicket hauls. In 1951, 1952, 1953, and 1954 seasons he took over 100 wickets, with Cannings taking his first ten wicket haul in a match in 1951. Cannings continued to take wickets for the county, taking over 50 wickets in the 1955, 1956, 1957, and 1959 seasons.\nCannings additionally represented TN Pearce's XI in a first-class match against Essex in 1952. In 1953, Cannings was the bowler who interrupted Bill Johnston\u2019s amazing run of sixteen not-outs in seventeen innings.\nCannings played his final first-class match for Hampshire in 1959 against Derbyshire. In the same season Cannings represented the Marylebone Cricket Club in a first-class match against Scotland, where he claimed two wickets.\nCannings played 230 first-class matches for Hampshire, scoring \t1,888 runs at an average of 9.88, with a high score of 43*. With the ball Cannings took 834 wickets at an average of 21.69, with best figures of 7\u201352. Cannings took 39 five wicket hauls and ten wickets in a match four times. Cannings was also an able fielder, taking 89 catches for the club.\nCannings overall first-class statistics in the bowling department were impressive. Cannings took 927 wickets at an average of 22.73, with best figures of 7\u201352. Cannings took 42 five wicket hauls and took ten wickets in a match four times. With the bat Cannings was a tailender, scoring 2,660 runs at an average of 10.85, with one half century which yielded him his highest first-class score of 61.\nAfter leaving Hampshire in 1959, Cannings joined Buckinghamshire in the 1960 Minor Counties Championship, making his debut against Norfolk. Cannings represented Buckinghamshire in ten Minor Counties matches in the 1960 season. Cannings returned to play for Buckinghamshire in 1962, representing them in two matches, with his final match for the county coming against Oxfordshire.\nIn 1963 Cannings stood as an umpire in a single Minor Counties Championship match between Berkshire and Devon. He died on 27 October 2016 at the age of 97.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["From 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 fours and three sixes. After World War II, Derek Shackleton became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by Victor Cannings, but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and Peter Sainsbury around 100, with Roy Marshall was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Warwickshire, let down by unreliable batting, were captained by attacking batsman Peter Cranmer. Despite their lack of success, they attracted large crowds to Edgbaston. Their best players were Test spinner Eric Hollies and batsman Tom Dollery, who was to become captain as a professional in 1948, though Dollery had a relatively poor season in 1947. Warwickshire were well served by their bowlers. In addition to Hollies, these were three new caps in the two seamers Victor Cannings and Charles Grove; and the New Zealand pace bowler Tom Pritchard. Dollery had to play as wicketkeeper in several matches when Cyril Goodway was unavailable. Playfair commented on advantages gained by the bowlers being \"squandered\" by inconsistent and unreliable batsmen. Five batsmen did exceed 1,000 runs but none had a good average: Cranmer, Dollery, Aubrey Hill, Jimmy Ord and Ken Taylor. Other players were Bill Fantham, John Hossell and Ron Maudsley.Playfair, pp. 108\u2013109. Warwickshire played eleven home matches at their Edgbaston headquarters in Birmingham and two matches at the Courtaulds Ground in Coventry."]}, {"page": "1919 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Victor Cannings, cricketer (died 2016)"]}, {"page": "United Services Recreation Ground", "response": ["First-class cricket returned to the ground after the war, when Hampshire played Essex. The record attendance for a county match was made in 1948, when 10,000 watched Hampshire played Sussex. Hampshire continued to play four matches per season there going into the 1950s.  It was during this time that under the leadership of Desmond Eagar and Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie that the Hampshire team was beginning to become a powerful force in the county game.  Coupled with the batting of Roy Marshall (who in five matches there in 1957 scored 549, an unbeaten record for the ground), Jimmy Gray and Henry Horton, and backed up with the bowling of Derek Shackleton, Victor Cannings and Malcolm Heath, Hampshire had a fairly successful period, finishing runners-up in 1958, before winning the County Championship for the first time in 1961, with Hampshire winning four of their five matches there in that season.  They might have been successful in 1958, had it not been for two draws later in the season at the ground. A new format, List A cricket, was introduced in 1963, two years after its introduction, the ground held its first List A match when Hampshire played Kent in the 1965 Gillette Cup. Six first-class matches had been held there in 1962, before the schedule at the ground was reduced back to five, with the expansion of List A cricket with the Player's County League and John Player League, on average two or three List A matches were held there over the coming seasons. Hampshire were pressing for the Player's County League title in 1969, with a crowd of 8,000 watching their defeat to Essex. Hampshire finished that season's competition one point behind winners Lancashire.  A first-class match in 1971 between Hampshire and the touring Pakistanis saw protests by Bangladeshis protesting Pakistani actions in the Bangladesh Liberation War. Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time in 1973, though the 1970s saw a gradual reduction in the number of first-class matches held there, by the end of that decade three first-class matches and two List A matches were granted to the ground each season. This decade also saw logistical problems for the ground, when at the Railway End trees were destroyed, whose removal interrupted the batsman line of sight.  As such, no matches were held there in 1975, though the purchase of screens allowed county cricket to return in 1976.  1976 was also not without its problems, when a County Championship match against Yorkshire was interrupted by vandals who had attacked the pitch during the night.  Despite this setback, the match continued on an adjoining strip of pitch."]}, {"page": "Vic Cannings", "response": ["#REDIRECT Victor Cannings"]}, {"page": "Old Belvedere Cricket Club", "response": ["Fr.
