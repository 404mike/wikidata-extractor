He represented England at under-16, under-19 and under-21 level.\nRoutledge began his career in London with Crystal Palace as a youth before making senior appearances with the first team. He then moved to Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur for two years but spent part of that time on loan to Portsmouth and Fulham. He made only five appearances with Tottenham before moving to Aston Villa for one season but only made two appearances and spent part of the time with Championship club Cardiff City on loan before a permanent transfer to fellow Championship team Queens Park Rangers.\nAfter one season with them, he moved clubs again, this time to Newcastle United, helping them to win promotion and the Championship title. During his time there, he was loaned back to QPR who also sealed the title at the end of the season. After they were promoted, Routledge signed for Swansea City in 2011, where he remained until his retirement in 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 7", "response": ["*1986 \u2013 Wayne Routledge, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Sidcup", "response": ["* Wayne Routledge (1985\u2013), footballer, born in Sidcup"]}, {"page": "Alan Smith (footballer, born 1980)", "response": ["Despite playing regularly as a deep lying midfielder, he lost his place after the January transfer window with the arrival of Wayne Routledge and Danny Guthrie's excellent form in central midfield.

Moore then scored his first goal of the season, on 3 December 2011, in a 4\u20132 loss against Blackburn Rovers. He continued to receive his playing time, mostly coming from the substitute bench.
