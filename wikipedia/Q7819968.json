After the game, and disappointed by the performance of most of the team, the selectors made nine changes for the upcoming match against Scotland. Only two backs were to be retained, Bobby Williams, the fullback, and Billy Geen, deemed the outstanding threequarter against England, moving from wing to centre. However, on the Wednesday preceding the encounter in Edinburgh, Geen withdrew after a training session due to an ongoing shoulder injury, and his place on the team was taken by Willie Watts."]}, {"page": "Walter Martin (rugby union)", "response": ["Martin joined Newport Rugby Club in 1904, and during his career would captain the club during one of the most successful era's for the club.

Martin did not play for Wales the next season, but was back after the First World War, in a game against the New Zealand Army, which is now recognised as an international game. Martin was not the first choice in the New Zealand game, as the selectors had chosen Cardiff's Clem Lewis, but Lewis had picked up an injury playing for the British Army team. Martin was drafted in as a late replacement but during the game injured his head saving a try. Martin was removed from play, but later recovered and resumed the game, although his play was not as strong after the event.Billot (1972), pg 51.

Griffiths did not have a good game; in the first half Canterbury wing Eric Harper easily beat Griffiths to score a try.Thomas (1979), pg 37. The tourists furthered their lead with a penalty goal, before Griffiths gave Newport hope with a penalty goal of his own, but despite heroic efforts by scrum-half Tommy Vile, the tourists won the game.

Cardiff beat the tourists 17-0, the largest defeat for the South Africans that tour. The same season, David won his first and only Welsh cap, when he was chosen to face Ireland as part of the 1907 Home Nations Championship. The game began in controversy after the Welsh captain, Billy Trew, withdrew in protest to the treatment of suspended teammate Fred Scrine, by the Welsh Rugby Union. This left a space open at centre, which was taken by Bush, and to ensure club continuity David was brought in as his partner. The game ended in a record win over the Irish for Wales, but despite this the next season David was replaced by Newport's Tommy Vile."]}]}}
