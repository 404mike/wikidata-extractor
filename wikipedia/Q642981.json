A versatile player who can play either on the right or at the centre of defence, he won 13 caps for Wales between 2005 and 2008. He is the younger brother of Robert Duffy.\nHe began his career at Swansea City, making his debut as a 16-year-old in December 2001, before winning a six-figure sum move to Premier League side Portsmouth in January 2004. He never broke into the first team picture at Fratton Park, and instead enjoyed numerous loan moves at Burnley, Coventry City, and former club Swansea. He switched to Millwall in February 2009, before signing with Exeter City in July 2009. He joined Port Vale in July 2012, and helped the club to secure promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313. He stayed at the club for four years before joining Notts County via Eastleigh in June 2016. He joined Kidsgrove Athletic in August 2019.\nHe began coaching at Congleton Town in May 2020 and was appointed as the club's manager 12 months later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 30", "response": ["*1985 \u2013 Richard Duffy, Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["With the club still unable to sign new players due to administration in May 2012, Adams offered contracts to 16 of his players for the 2012\u201313 campaign. However, he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins, Anthony Griffith, Sean Rigg, and captain and top-scorer Marc Richards; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere, leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch. He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion, finishing as the division's top-scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign."]}, {"page": "Jabo Ibehre", "response": ["Fellow League One club Southend United snapped up Ibehre on loan on 27 November 2009 for a one-month period.
