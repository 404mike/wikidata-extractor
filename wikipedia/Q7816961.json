He was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. His appearances in first-class cricket were restricted by his profession as a school teacher.\nMottram first represented the Lancashire Second XI in two matches in the 1970 Minor Counties Championship against Cumberland and Yorkshire Second XI.\nSix feet four inches tall, Mottram joined Hampshire in 1971, making his debut in a List-A match against Somerset. He made his first-class debut in 1972 against the touring Australians. His County Championship debut came against Worcestershire at the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth.\nMottram was a part of Hampshire's 1973 County Championship winning team, where he starred with the ball taking 57 wickets at an average of 22.00, including career best figures of 6-63. His performances and personality made him a cult figure at the club.Mottram played most of his cricket for Hampshire in the one-day form of the game, playing in 83 matches, the last of which came in 1977 against Kent. Mottram took 135 wickets at the brilliant average of 18.69 with career best figures of 5-21.\nIn 1976 Mottram's first-class career came to an end, with his final match against Derbyshire.

But his bowling was reliable in first-class cricket, taking 111 wickets at an average of 24.11.\nAt the end of the 1977 County Championship Mottram left Hampshire. He died in July 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Mottram", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Mottram"]}]}}
