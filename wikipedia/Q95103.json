He is a co-editor of the St. Austin Review and editor-in-chief of Sapientia Press. He also teaches Shakespearian literature for an online Catholic curriculum provider.\nPearce has written biographies of literary figures, often Christian, including William Shakespeare, J. R. R. Tolkien, Oscar Wilde, C. S. Lewis, G. K. Chesterton, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Hilaire Belloc. His books have been translated into at least nine languages.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn", "response": ["In an interview with Joseph Pearce, however, Solzhenitsyn commented, \"[The Old Believers were] treated amazingly unjustly, because some very insignificant, trifling differences in ritual which were promoted with poor judgment and without much sound basis. Because of these small differences, they were persecuted in very many cruel ways, they were suppressed, they were exiled. From the perspective of historical justice, I sympathise with them and I am on their side, but this in no way ties in with what I have just said about the fact that religion in order to keep up with mankind must adapt its forms toward modern culture. In other words, do I agree with the Old Believers that religion should freeze and not move at all? Not at all!\"Joseph Pearce (2011), Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile, Ignatius Press. Page 329\u2013330.", "When asked by Pearce for his opinions about the division within the Roman Catholic Church over the Second Vatican Council and the Mass of Paul VI, Solzhenitsyn replied, \"A question peculiar to the Russian Orthodox Church is, should we continue to use Old Church Slavonic, or should we start to introduce more of the contemporary Russian language into the service? I understand the fears of both those in the Orthodox and in the Catholic Church, the wariness, the hesitation, and the fear that this is lowering the Church to the modern condition, the modern surroundings. I understand this, but alas, I fear that if religion does not allow itself to change, it will be impossible to return the world to religion because the world is incapable on its own of rising as high as the old demands of religion. Religion needs to come and meet it somewhat.\"Joseph Pearce (2011), Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile, Ignatius Press. Page 330.", "Surprised to hear Solzhenitsyn, \"so often perceived as an arch-traditionalist, apparently coming down on the side of the reformers\", Pearce then asked Solzhenitsyn what he thought of the division caused within the Anglican Communion by the decision to ordain female priests.Joseph Pearce (2011), Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile, Ignatius Press. Pages 330-331.", "Solzhenitsyn replied, \"Certainly there are many firm boundaries that should not be changed. When I speak of some sort of correlation between the cultural norms of the present, it is really only a small part of the whole thing.\" Solzhenitsyn then added, \"Certainly, I do not believe that women priests is the way to go!\"Joseph Pearce (2011), Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile, Ignatius Press.

He replied, \"I do believe that it would be the key, but I don't think this will happen, because people succumb to fashion, and they suffer from inertia and it is hard to them to come round to a different point of view.\"", "Solzhenitsyn refused to accept Russia's highest honor, the Order of St. Andrew, in 1998. Solzhenitsyn later said: \"In 1998, it was the country's low point, with people in misery; ... Yeltsin decreed I be honored the highest state order. I replied that I was unable to receive an award from a government that had led Russia into such dire straits.\" In a 2003 interview with Joseph Pearce, Solzhenitsyn said: \"We are exiting from communism in a most unfortunate and awkward way.

To this putrefaction of the soul, this spiritual enslavement, human beings who wish to be human cannot submit.

Pearce likens Smaug's pride to that of Achilles, whose pride leads to the death of his best friend, and of many Greeks; and to the cockerel Chauntecleer in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Nun's Priest's Tale\", where a boastful reply to the flattering fox causes the cockerel's fall."]}, {"page": "Lonely Mountain", "response": ["William H. Green calls the Lonely Mountain the fourth and final stage of Bilbo's education. He identifies multiple parallels and repetitions of structure between the stages, each one involving a journey, privation, and \"unlikely escape\". The Lonely Mountain stage, too, symbolically echoes the first stage in the Shire: before setting out, Bilbo was peacefully smoking a pipe of tobacco at his own front door; at the mountain, the smoke is the dragon's, and its meaning is anything but peaceful. The Christian writer Joseph Pearce views the journey to the Lonely Mountain as a \"pilgrimage of grace\", a Christian bildungsroman, at its deepest level. Pearce states further that Bilbo's quest to the mountain parallel's Frodo's quest to a different mountain, Mount Doom,  which he calls \"a mirror of Everyman's journey through life\"."]}, {"page": "Bilbo Baggins", "response": ["The Christian writer Joseph Pearce describes The Hobbit as \"a pilgrimage of grace, in which its protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, becomes grown up ... in wisdom and virtue\". Dorothy Matthews sees the story rather as a psychological journey, the anti-heroic Bilbo being willing to face challenges while firmly continuing to love home and discovering himself. Along the way, Matthews sees Jungian archetypes, talismans, and symbols at every turn: the Jungian wise old man Gandalf; the devouring mother of the giant spider, not to mention Gollum's \"long grasping fingers\"; the Jungian circle of the self, the ring; the escape from the dark underground imprisoning chambers of the wood-elves and Bilbo's symbolic rebirth into the sunlight and the waters of the woodland river; and the dragon guarding the contested treasure, itself \"an archetype of the self, of psychic wholeness\". Later research has extended Matthews' analysis using alternative psychological frameworks such as Erik Erikson's theory of development."]}, {"page": "Goldberry", "response": ["For several critics, the appearance of Goldberry in The Lord of the Rings foreshadows that of Galadriel's later appearance: both are beautiful and of regal stature, live in an isolated domain and are associated with water. Ann McCauley Basso compared Goldberry as a biblical Eve figure to Galadriel's Mary. In an entry on redemption in mythopoeic writing by the Catholic writer Joseph Pearce for the J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, the apparent innocence and primitive nature of Goldberry and Tom Bombadil is analogous to Adam and Eve, as they represent the \"Unfallen Creation\"."]}, {"page": "Palant\u00edr", "response": ["A major theme of palant\u00edr usage is that while the stones show real objects or events, those using the stones had to \"possess great strength of will and of mind\" to direct the stone's gaze to its full capability. The Silmarillion, \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\" For others attempting to use the palant\u00edr, the stones were often an unreliable guide to action, since to them it was unclear whether events shown were past or future; what was not shown could be more important than what was selectively presented. A risk lay in the fact that users with sufficient power could choose what to show and what to conceal to other stones: in The Lord of the Rings, a palant\u00edr falls into the Enemy's hands making the usefulness of all other existing stones questionable. Commentators such as Paul Kocher note the hand of providence in their usage, while Joseph Pearce compares Sauron's use of the stones to broadcast wartime propaganda. Tom Shippey suggests that the message is that \"speculation\", looking into any sort of magic mirror (Latin: speculum) or stone to see the future, rather than trusting in Providence, leads to error.", "Joseph Pearce compares Sauron's use of the seeing stones to \"broadcast propaganda and sow the seeds of despair among his enemies\" with the communications technologies used to spread propaganda in the Second World War and then the Cold War, when Tolkien was writing."]}, {"page": "Ainulindal\u00eb", "response": ["Although commentary on The Silmarillion has primarily focused on the work as a whole, the reaction to the \"Ainulindal\u00eb\" has been generally positive. A British writer, Joseph Pearce, called it \"the most important part of The Silmarillion\" and said, \"The myth of creation is perhaps the most significant and most beautiful of Tolkien's works.\" Brian Rosebury considered the \"Ainulindal\u00eb\" a success, with \"appropriately 'scriptural'\" prose. Several Jesuits have praised the story; James V. Schall said, \"I have never read anything as beautiful as the first page of The Silmarillion\" and Robert Murray said, \"In all literature, from the formation of the sacred books of humanity, it is very difficult to find a comparable mythological story of creation by its beauty and imaginative power.\""]}, {"page": "Graham Greene", "response": ["In his discussions with Father Trollope, the priest to whom he went for instruction in Catholicism, Greene argued with the cleric \"on the ground of dogmatic atheism\", as Greene's primary difficulty with religion was what he termed the \"if\" surrounding God's existence.

His friend and fellow Catholic Evelyn Waugh attacked that as a revival of the Quietist heresy. This aspect of his work also was criticised by the theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar, as giving sin a mystique. Greene responded that constructing a vision of pure faith and goodness in the novel was beyond his talents.
