In the late 1920s he and his wife, Irene (nee Trewavas),  moved to Kuala Lumpur where Alexander worked as a soil microbiologist for the Rubber Research Institute of Malaya.  There he became an expert on Malaysian butterflies, co-authoring The Butterflies of the Malay Peninsula with H.M. Pendlebury in 1934. In 1931 he and his family returned to the UK and Alexander worked at the ICI research station at Jealotts Hill. He later became deputy keeper of entomology at the British Museum (Natural History).\nThe 1943 Ronald Fisher, Corbet, Williams paper on the unseen species problem in ecology was a key contribution in the field of community ecology, and remains important to this day.Corbet had four children, two of which died in infancy. Both of his adult children acquired his interest in entomology: his son Philip Steven Corbet became an authority on dragonflies and his daughter Sarah Alexandra Corbet is an authority on British bumble bees and plant pollination.Alexander Steven Corbet died of heart failure in 1948.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Corbet (surname)", "response": ["* Alexander Steven Corbet (1896\u20131948), British chemist and naturalist.

It more specifically relates to how many new species would be discovered if more samples were taken in an ecosystem. The study of the unseen species problem was started in the early 1940s by Alexander Steven Corbet. He spent 2 years in British Malaya trapping butterflies and was curious how many new species he would discover if he spent another 2 years trapping. Many different estimation methods have been developed to determine how many new species would be discovered given more samples. The unseen species problem also applies more broadly, as the estimators can be used to estimate any new elements of a set not previously found in samples. An example of this is determining how many words William Shakespeare knew based on all of his written works. The unseen species problem can be broken down mathematically as follows:", "In the early 1940s Alexander Steven Corbet spent 2 years in British Malaya trapping butterflies. He kept track of how many species he observed, and how many members of each species were captured. For example, he captured only 2 members of 74 different species. When he returned to the United Kingdom, he approached statistician Ronald Fisher, and asked how many new species of butterflies he could expect to catch if he went trapping for another two years. In essence, Corbet was asking how many species he observed zero times. Fisher responded with a simple estimation: for an additional 2 years of trapping, Corbet could expect to capture 75 new species. He did this using a simple summation (data provided by Orlitsky in Table 1 below in the Example section): U=-\\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^i \\varphi_i = 118 - 74 + 44 - 24 + \\cdots - 12 + 6 = 75 Here, \\varphi_i corresponds to the number of individual species which were observed i times. Fisher's sum was later confirmed by Good\u2013Toulmin.", "* Alexander Steven Corbet"]}, {"page": "List of butterflies of Laos", "response": ["* Key papers listed by author at Wikispecies are by: Edward John Godfrey, Yunosuke Kimura, Henry Maurice Pendlebury, Alexander Steven Corbet, Osamu Yata, Takashi Shir\u00f4zu, John Nevill Eliot, Amnuay Pinratan, Yunosuke Kimura, Kotaro Saito, Yasuo Seki, papers by Japanese authors in Yadoriga (Entomological Society of Japan) online and open access)"]}, {"page": "Steven Corbet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Steven Corbet"]}]}}
