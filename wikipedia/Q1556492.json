His early education was at the Oberrealschule, G\u00f6ttingen. He fled Germany with his family in 1933, as his father and maternal grandfather were Jewish. He then attended The Perse School, Cambridge and Edinburgh Academy.  He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. \nAs a doctor serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps, he was one of the first to witness the after-effects of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima.  He was struck by the incidence of severe bleeding disorders among the survivors which was due to a lack of platelets due to radiation damage.  This drove much of his later research.  He developed a simple device to measure the platelet aggregation rate which revolutionised the diagnosis of platelet related blood diseases and led to the development of antiplatelet medicines that have reduced the risk of heart attack and stroke for millions of people worldwide. He did not patent the device, saying that that scientific advances with medical implications should not be exploited for commercial gain.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921", "response": ["** Gustav Victor Rudolf Born, German-British pharmacologist (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry", "response": ["* Gustav Victor Rudolf Born"]}, {"page": "The Perse School", "response": ["*Gustav Victor Rudolf Born, pharmacologist"]}, {"page": "List of refugees", "response": ["*Gustav Victor Rudolf Born - pharmacologist - German-Jewish refugee"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Gustav Victor Rudolf Born, professor of pharmacology", "* Georgina Born, anthropologist; daughter of Gustav Victor Rudolf Born"]}, {"page": "Gustav Born", "response": ["* Gustav Victor Rudolf Born (1921\u20132018)"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (G)", "response": ["# Gustav Victor Rudolf Born"]}, {"page": "Sheild Professor of Pharmacology", "response": ["* 1973\u20131978 Gustav Victor Rudolf Born"]}, {"page": "Anti-Concorde Project", "response": ["*Professor Gustav Victor Rudolf Born, FRCP, FRS, Dept. of Pharmacology, King's College, London"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Gustav Victor Rudolf Born||16/03/1972||29 July 1921 \u2013 16 April 2018"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1972", "response": ["# Gustav Victor Rudolf Born"]}, {"page": "Gustav V.
