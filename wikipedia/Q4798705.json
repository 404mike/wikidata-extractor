Arthur Foot had taught at The Doon School in India, which some commentators called the country's Eton. He had made an outstanding contribution there, for which he was appointed a CBE.", "Arthur Foot based Ottershaw on Winchester College, his old public school. For instance, he introduced small desks called \"toyes\", with a backboard and cupboard, which each student had as their own property each term. Just like at Winchester College, every evening, students would sit at their toyes to study, in a large room, watched over by a prefect.", "In 1964, Arthur Foot retired and Allan Dodds was appointed as the new headmaster. Dodds was a Cambridge graduate, previously a housemaster at St Peter's York, a justice of the peace, Samaritan and founder of the Boarding Schools Association. He successfully saw the school, of just 250 students, through a rapidly changing educational climate. But, at that size, which gave it a lower student to teacher ratio than the most exclusive public schools, the Conservative Party (UK) politicians who ran Surrey county council, did not think it represented value for money. After Ottershaw School closed, Dodds first became a Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) civil servant, before being appointed personal assistant to the Bishop of Southwark, the Right Reverend Ronald Bowlby. Dodds died in March 2016. His son Richard Dodds OBE, who grew up at the school, is a former English field hockey player and was captain of the gold medal-winning Great Britain squad in the 1988 Summer Seoul Olympics.
