After attending Congleton grammar school, he entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1724 at the age of sixteen and graduated B.A. in 1728.  In 1732 he was ordained and served small cures, first at Yoxall, Staffordshire, and afterwards at Goostrey, a chapel under Sandbach.  In 1733 he married Mary Hall of Hermitage and they had one son Edward, who died at age 22.  On the death of his father in 1753 he inherited Elworth, and due to delicate health, resigned his clerical duties and lived there in seclusion until his death.  He was buried in the parish church of Middlewich. The fullest account of his life appears to be the memoir prefixed to Richard Parkinson's 1837 Hulsean lectures, Rationalism and Revelation."]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*Richard Parkinson, Canon of Manchester Cathedral, college principal, theologian and antiquarian"]}, {"page": "St Bees railway station", "response": ["In 1848 Canon Richard Parkinson, Vicar of St Bees and Principal of the Theological College, wrote in his diary: \"November 8th., 1848.

Newcome was no stranger to the shuttle-board or the billiard table; though he never drank healths he drank wine, and had a weakness for tobacco.

However, the college prospered immediately, with numbers rising to 36 admissions in 1822.

Although Ainger also carried out all the duties of a parish priest, he had the time and energy to make the reputation of the college grow.

His successor was Richard Parkinson, who had been a lecturer at the college until 1833, when he was appointed a Fellow of Manchester Collegiate church (now the cathedral). Under Parkinson College admissions rose, and he set about schemes for improving the college and buildings. He proposed to incorporate the college with a charter, so it could confer degrees, and to build residential accommodation. Parkinson offered to donate \u00a35,000 personally. However, he would not surrender power to a proposed governing council of clergy and laity, and consequently the scheme failed. Had the college progressed in this way, it may well have survived into the 20th century.
