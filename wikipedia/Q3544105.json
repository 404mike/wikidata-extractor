Clark's first son died in December 1996 within a few weeks of his birth, and her second son died in similar circumstances in January 1998. A month later, Clark was arrested and tried for both deaths. The defence argued that the children had died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The prosecution case relied on flawed statistical evidence presented by paediatrician Professor Sir Roy Meadow, who testified that the chance of two children from an affluent family suffering SIDS was 1 in 73 million. He had arrived at this figure by squaring his estimate of a chance of 1 in 8500 of an individual SIDS death in similar circumstances. The Royal Statistical Society later issued a statement arguing that there was no statistical basis for Meadow's claim, and expressed concern at the \"misuse of statistics in the courts\".Clark was convicted in November 1999. The convictions were upheld on appeal in October 2000, but overturned in a second appeal in January 2003, after it emerged that Alan Williams, the prosecution forensic pathologist who examined both babies, had failed to disclose microbiological reports that suggested the second of her sons had died of natural causes. Clark was released from prison having served more than three years of her sentence. Journalist Geoffrey Wansell called Clark's experience \"one of the great miscarriages of justice in modern British legal history\". As a result of her case, the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith ordered a review of hundreds of other cases, and two other women had their convictions overturned. Clark's experience caused her to develop severe psychiatric problems and she died in her home in March 2007 from alcohol poisoning.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prosecutor's fallacy", "response": ["== The Sally Clark case ==", "Sally Clark, a British woman, was accused in 1998 of having killed her first child at 11 weeks of age and then her second child at 8 weeks of age. The prosecution had expert witness Sir Roy Meadow, a professor and consultant paediatrician, testify that the probability of two children in the same family dying from SIDS is about 1 in 73 million. That was much less frequent than the actual rate measured in historical data \u2013 Meadow estimated it from single-SIDS death data, and the assumption that the probability of such deaths should be uncorrelated between infants.The population-wide probability of a SIDS fatality was about 1 in 1,303; Meadow generated his 1-in-73 million estimate from the lesser probability of SIDS death in the Clark household, which had lower risk factors (e.g. non-smoking). In this sub-population he estimated the probability of a single death at 1 in 8,500. See: . Professor Ray Hill questioned even this first step (1/8,500 vs 1/1,300) in two ways: firstly, on the grounds that it was biased, excluding those factors that increased risk (especially that both children were boys) and (more importantly) because reductions in SIDS risk factors will proportionately reduce murder risk factors, so that the relative frequencies of M\u00fcnchausen syndrome by proxy and SIDS will remain in the same ratio as in the general population: "]}, {"page": "List of statistics articles", "response": ["*Sally Clark (prob/stats related court case)"]}, {"page": "Frances Farmer", "response": ["In music, she is portrayed in the songs \"The Medal Song\" (1984) by Culture Club, \"Frances Farmer\" (2004) by Patterson Hood, \"Ugly Little Dreams\" (1985) by Everything but the Girl, \"Paint By Numbers (Song For Frances)\" by Romanovsky and Phillips, and \"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle\" (1993) by Nirvana on their final studio album, In Utero.

In addition he extrapolated his erroneous figures stating that the 1 in 73,000,000 incidence was only likely to occur once every hundred years in England, Scotland and Wales.
