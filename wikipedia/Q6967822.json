The ASL caused more problems for USFA in 1927 when the league signed numerous top European players to lucrative contracts.  This led FIFA to consider suspending USFA.  However, at the Sixteenth Annual Congress of FIFA, the USFA offered several concessions which led to an agreement among national organizations regarding player contracts.  In 1928, several ASL team owners began to chafe again under USFA rules.  The most vexing was the requirement to enter the National Challenge Cup which ran during the league\u2019s season.  The ASL had two main objections to the Challenge Cup, one financial, the other scheduling.  As the cup was open to all teams registered with USFA, ASL teams found themselves playing unknown amateur and semi-professional opponents before non-paying crowds.  These games also interfered with the league\u2019s schedule.  As a result, the ASL decided to boycott the 1928 cup.September 17, 1928 The Globe  Three of the ASL teams, Bethlehem Steel, Newark Skeeters and New York Giants chose to enter the cup.
