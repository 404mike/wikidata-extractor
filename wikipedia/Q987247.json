The sequence ended with a large white '24' seen from the front left against a red ellipse on a cream background with the one-line BBC News logo overlaid the numeral in the centre of the screen. The music for the ident and for the whole of BBC News was composed by David Lowe and incorporated elements such as the BBC Pips, used on BBC Radio to mark the hour. This score was vastly different from the orchestral scores used by other news producers ITN and Sky News. The music was considered bold and different.", "For the re-launch, the idea of a filler was extended further to a full countdown. This consisted of world continents rotating on the left hand side of the screen which overlapped two large numerals filling the right side of the screen counting down until the top of the hour. The soundtrack used an extended version of David Lowe's soundtrack for the main titles. The beeps in the soundtrack, similar to the BBC Pips, corresponded to the seconds changing and became louder and more noticeable from 10 seconds. This countdown came with and without the BBC News 24 one-line logo at the bottom and also had programming details overlaid on some junctions.", "One final change of the look occurred in January 2003 when the countdown sequence was replaced by four sequences showing peoples busy lives, combining a mix of ordinary footage and time-lapse photography. These scenes were counted down by the David Lowe theme and an italicised second counter in the bottom right corner.", "Nicknamed the 'clamshell' in reference to the finishing position of the red segments, the ident began with the rapid expansion of a red sphere with a disc intersecting it to reveal a globe before the disc segments reform together as the background to the globe in the familiar clamshell design. Overlaid the globe, and formed at the conclusion by the formation of five lines, is a large numeral '24'. Below the ident at the bottom of the screen is a white BBC News logo. The composed by David Lowe was altered by him for the new look. A key part of the look was the inclusion of the top headline into a ribbon which orbited the globe for a time before retracting back; other ribbons of this nature were present in the background, but featured the BBC News logo. The 24 numeral was originally a creamy yellow in colour before becoming silver in colour in 2004 when the identity was subsequently adopted across the television news output. The '24' numeral was dropped when the titles are used in BBC News bulletins on BBC One. Contains pictorial evidence of channel graphics and astons.

As part of this, a new look was commissioned by Mark Byford, designed by Lambie-Nairn and the BBC News designers, featured a new remix of the theme by David Lowe and was subsequently applied to the whole BBC News output. The result of this was that BBC News 24 was renamed as BBC News and referred to on air as the BBC News Channel. This was as a result of a survey which revealed that the majority of the population referred to the channel as News 24 and saw the channel as inferior to the main news bulletins.", "The new ident featured a rotating coil of metal, with teeth cut into the outside edges of the spiralled coil. Pulsating rings would also be emitted from the coil as it spun, reflecting the BBC News style at the time, and the camera angle would often change position throughout the ident. The ident ended with the one-line BBC Parliament logo appearing in the centre of the screen. The ident itself was a filmed model, built and shot at Pirate by Martin Godward and lit by Tony May with post production by SVC. The soundtrack was by David Lowe and was similar to the BBC News theme of the time and reflected the similarity between the channel and the BBC News service.", "In April 2009, BBC Parliament was rebranded and brought up to date and more into line with BBC News output. The new design was by Lambie-Nairn and the music was by David Lowe.", "The ident used prior to programmes on the channel featured a rotating ellipse shape against a rotating globe background upon which the BBC World logo appears on top in white. In contrast, the news bulletins used the same cream and red colour scheme used by the rest of the BBC News network, with the exception of Breakfast News. These titles features pulsating rings moving over a small cream-and-red spinning globe in the centre of the screen from various angles while place names of various cities appear around. The globe finished inside two intersecting red ellipses, before the BBC News one-line logo appears in the centre of the screen and the BBC World one-line logo appears at the bottom of the screen. The music was composed by David Lowe and was used on the rest of the BBC News network.", "A new countdown was also introduced with the look, featuring an orange globe rotating while the orange logo segments rise and fall around the globe, with the countdown seconds viewed on the globe itself as shaded numerals. After five seconds, the numerals disappear from the globe as the globe shrinks back into the BBC World ident, providing a seamless link. The music used is another variation of David Lowe's theme, however with more exotic themes inserted into the music and a greater emphasis on the second markers also. The set for the look was retained unchanged until 2006.", "The titles featured exactly the same on screen look as BBC News channel and featured an abstract globe of red pulsating rings against a white background with interconnected place names. The change of name also resulted in a new box logo for BBC World News; this featured the 'World News' name on a separate line for each word below the BBC logo in a red box, matching the colour of the BBC News department logo as a whole, and of the same size as the other BBC box logos used domestically. The new logo was placed in the bottom corner on the ident. For junctions into non news programming, an ident featuring the globe and box logo appearing in the centre of the screen as each pulsating ring pass over it, was used. The David Lowe music was retained, sharing a similarity with the domestic channel while appealing to more multicultural audiences.
