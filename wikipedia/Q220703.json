Due to its displacement, the former front door is now located in the fa\u00e7ade of the gallery, some 6m above the ground over Hillhead Street. The Mackintosh House comprises the principal interiors of the original house (including the dining room, studio-drawing room and bedroom), largely replicating the room layout of the old end-of-terrace building. It features the meticulously reassembled interiors from the Mackintoshes\u2019 home, including items of original furniture, fitments and decorations. The exhibits strikingly demonstrate Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u2019s concept of the room as a work of art."]}, {"page": "Marie Kr\u00f8yer", "response": ["Marie Kr\u00f8yer was inspired by the Scottish designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh to design furniture. When she and her husband moved into the town clerk's house in Skagen Vesterby in 1895, she designed the furniture and the interiors, as she did when they acquired their Copenhagen home in Bergensgade. Some of her pieces of furniture are now in the National Museum of Denmark. As she subscribed to the journal The Studio, she could also follow developments by William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones, who were members of the Arts and Crafts movement. Her interests extended to fireplaces, woven fabrics, kitchen fittings and wall panels, inspiring the Skagen architect Ulrik Plesner to take account of her plans in his own work."]}]}}
