Match.com in 1995 was one of the first sites to host personal ads online. At the time, few people had computer access. As Internet access increased, so did interest in online personal ads and computer dating, with the first free dating sites appearing between 2005 and 2010. With smartphones, dating apps such as Tinder became popular. While personal ads in publications never gained social acceptance in France, the use of online dating sites are more popular. Online personal ads are freed from the space limitations of print ads. Additionally, websites and apps that host personals typically provide automated menus or sortable categories for common information, freeing the advertiser to tailor the narrative portion of the ad to their specific objectives."]}, {"page": "Dating", "response": ["The first large-scale computer dating system, The Scientific Marriage Foundation, was established in 1957 by Dr. George W.

Users filled out a paper questionnaire that they mailed with a $3 fee. The questionnaire was geared to young college students seeking a date, not a marriage partner. Questions included \"Do you believe in a God who answers prayer?\" and \"Is extensive sexual activity in preparation for marriage part of 'growing up?'\" The questionnaires were transferred to punched cards and processed on an IBM 7090 computer at the Avco service bureau in Wilmington, Massachusetts.

However, Patterson struggled to find clients at first, and engaged in shady business practices: he was convicted of fraud in 1969 for selling lists of women who signed up for his dating service to men who were looking for prostitutes. Dateline relied heavily on advertising, taking out the first full-page ads for a dating service in newspaper and magazines during the early 1970s, and becoming known for its catchphrase, \"You too can find love.\" In 1974, Patterson bought out and absorbed Com-Pat, his only major competitor and the first computer dating service in the UK, started in 1964 by Joan Ball. Patterson also published a monthly magazine titled Singles, and in 1975 he launched a travel agency, Singles Holidays.  While these ventures eventually folded, Dateline continued to operate throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. During the 1990s, some estimates suggested that the company matched more than 40,000 prospective couples a year, approximately 2,000 of whom ended up getting married."]}, {"page": "Timeline of online dating services", "response": ["| St. James Computer Dating Service (later to become Com-Pat) launches.
