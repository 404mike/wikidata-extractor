He was until recently a professor of computer science at the University of Essex, England. Previously, he has held faculty positions at Caltech, University of Bielefeld, Starlab and the University of the West of England.\nHolland is best known for his work in biologically-inspired robotics, where he has contributed to the theory and practice of collective robotics, ant algorithms and machine consciousness, among other sub-fields. Some of the projects he has been involved in have attracted attention from the media, notably the Slugbot project, which aimed to produce a robotic predator capable of sustaining its energy levels from hunting and digesting snails.\nFor the last ten years he has mainly been interested in the prospects for building a conscious machine. In 2001 he was an organiser and session chair for one of the first symposia on machine consciousness, and in 2003 he edited a special issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies  on the topic. In 2004 he obtained the first major funding for a machine consciousness project which investigated whether a human-like robot with a self-model and a world-model might exhibit features characteristic of consciousness. The robot, CRONOS, is now being further developed in a European project ECCEROBOT led by Owen, which will run from 2009 \u2013 2011. Holland has been an active contributor to most of the machine consciousness symposia held in the last decade, and serves on the editorial board of the International Journal of Machine Consciousness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of the West of England, Bristol", "response": ["* Owen Holland"]}, {"page": "William Grey Walter", "response": ["In 2000, an original tortoise went on display in London, UK, in the Science Museum.Holland, Owen. \"Exploration and high adventure: The legacy of Grey Walter.\" Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences \u00b7 November 2003. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9025611_Exploration_and_high_adventure_The_legacy_of_Grey_Walter Recently, one was also replicated by Dr Owen Holland, of the University of the West of England in 1995, using some of the original parts.

He was particularly interested in the spatial and spectral properties of natural scenes in relation to the properties of biological systems, and in studying these interactions in species other than humans, in natural environments from the African rain-forest to Bristol's Leigh Woods. With Susan Blackmore, he contributed to the discovery of change blindness and worked on why misjudgments of probability lead people to believe in the paranormal. He was also involved in attempts to create a conscious robot with Iain Gilchrist and Owen Holland (funded by the EPSRC Adventure Fund). Other collaborators, from many different fields, included C. Alejandro P\u00e1rraga and David Tolhurst on computational modelling, Katerina Mania on virtual reality, and Innes Cuthill and Julian Partridge on bird vision. In the last year or so before he died, Tom had also become very interested in the area of empirical aesthetics, specifically with reference to the feeling of 'presence' as affected by factors like screen size when watching movies."]}, {"page": "Owen Holland", "response": ["Owen Holland may refer to:", "* Owen Holland (academic), professor of cognitive robotics", "* Owen Holland (MP) (died 1601), Welsh politician"]}, {"page": "John Bates (neurophysiologist)", "response": ["John Alexander Vincent Bates (1918-1993) was an English neurophysiologist based at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases from 1946 until his retirement.P.
