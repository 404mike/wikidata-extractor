Whittaker appeared in her first full series as The Doctor in the eleventh series, which premiered in October 2018. She continued in the role in the twelfth series in 2020.

Whittaker had previously starred in television series such as Return to Cranford,  Broadchurch alongside David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) and the dystopian anthology Black Mirror.
