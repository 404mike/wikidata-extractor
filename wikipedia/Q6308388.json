The office of the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman emphasises that it looks into complaints \"that government departments, their agencies and some other public bodies in the UK \u2013 and the NHS in England \u2013 have not acted properly or fairly or have provided a poor service.\" The first UK Ombudsman was Sir Edmund Compton who had previously been the Comptroller and Auditor General. He was succeeded by Sir Alan Marre, a career civil servant. He was the first Ombudsman appointed for the National Health Service and combined that role with that of the Parliamentary Ombudsman as have all his successors. He later became chairman of Age Concern. The post was held by Dame Julie Mellor DBE from January 2012 until July 2016.", "In October 2014, Julie Mellor and Local Government Ombudsman Jane Martin argued for a combined Health and Local Government watchdog, which would be able to instigate investigations as it sees fit, instead of them being triggered by patient complaints. Rob Behrens said in November 2018 after the publication of a favourable report into the organisation by the Republic of Ireland ombudsman that he wanted a change in the law so the Ombudsman could launch investigations without a formal complaint. He wanted it to become a complaints standards authority with regulatory powers over the NHS as is the case in Scotland.  The report said the law regulating the office was outdated and out of line with similar organisations in the UK and elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Demos (UK think tank)", "response": ["|Julie Mellor"]}, {"page": "List of Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*2006: Averil Cameron, Liz Forgan, Anna Hassan, Carole Jordan, Susan Leather, Julie Mellor, Janet Nelson, Daphne Sheldrick, Ruth Silver, Vivienne Westwood"]}, {"page": "The Westgate School, Winchester", "response": ["* Dame Julie Mellor, Chair from 1999-2005 of the Equal Opportunities Commission"]}, {"page": "Ann Abraham", "response": ["She finished her term as Ombudsman in December 2011 and was succeeded by Dame Julie Mellor."]}]}}
