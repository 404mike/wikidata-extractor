A Welsh international, he was a member of the Preston North End side which became known as \"The Invincibles\".He was born at Ffestiniog on 5 August 1862 and educated at Friars School, Bangor and University College, Aberystwyth. As a student he played both association football and rugby football, but he eventually emerged as a first rate goalkeeper while studying at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He made the first of his eight appearances for Wales in 1885, and in 1887 was invited to play as an amateur for Preston North End in their FA Cup ties. He was a member of the Preston sides which were FA Cup Finalists in 1888 and FA Cup Winners in 1889. Their victory in the Cup in the 1888\u201389 season was achieved without conceding a single goal throughout, which was attributed to his goalkeeping skills. He also played for Barnes, Casuals, and Birmingham St George's. He retired in 1890, but was persuaded to make a last appearance for Wales in 1892.\nBetween 1884 and 1888, he made seven appearances for the Corinthians amateur club, including playing for Corinthian three times against Preston North End.Mills-Roberts qualified as a doctor in July 1887, and the following year was appointed the house surgeon at Birmingham General Hospital. He later took a position with the hospital at the Dinorwic Slate Quarry, and served with the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War. At the end of his working career, he retired to Bournemouth, where aged 73 he died on 27 November 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucester City A.F.C.", "response": ["* Robert Mills-Roberts \u2013 Eight caps for Wales"]}, {"page": "Robert Roberts", "response": ["*Robert Mills-Roberts (1862\u20131935), Preston North End F.C. and Wales international football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "The Invincibles (English football)", "response": ["|GK || || Robert Mills-Roberts"]}, {"page": "1935 in Wales", "response": ["*27 November \u2013 Robert Mills-Roberts, footballer, 73"]}, {"page": "1889 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|GK || ||Robert Mills-Roberts"]}, {"page": "Friars School, Bangor", "response": ["* Robert Mills-Roberts \u2013 surgeon and international footballer"]}, {"page": "1862 in Wales", "response": ["*5 August - Robert Mills-Roberts, footballer (d. 1935)"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 Football League", "response": ["| Dr Robert Mills-Roberts ||Goalkeeper||align=center|2||align=center|0"]}, {"page": "Aberystwyth Town F.C.", "response": ["* Dr. Robert Mills-Roberts, Welsh international goalkeeper in the 1880 and 1890s."]}, {"page": "Bob Roberts (footballer, born 1863)", "response": ["Roberts' second international appearance came the following February when he was called in as an emergency goalkeeper in the absence of Robert Mills-Roberts, who had temporarily \"retired\" from football following injuries to both wrists shortly before the preceding international against England, in which he conceded four goals.
