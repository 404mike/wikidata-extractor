Argyle played two home games in a row, the first seeing the team's first win of 2012, with a 2\u20131 win over Burton Albion, where two goals from Simon Walton either side of a goal from Calvin Zola sealed the points. The second game saw Argyle rescue a late point thanks to Maxime Blanchard's first goal in English football, the goal lifted Argyle out of the bottom two with the French defender scoring an overhead kick to cancel out Pablo Mills' first half stoppage time goal for high flying Crawley Town. The last game of the month saw the Greens travel to Port Vale's Vale Park, where an 86th minute Tom Pope goal saw the hosts win 1\u20130. Youth goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth left to join Truro City on loan, whilst striker Rory Patterson returned from his loan at Linfield and was immediately released. On the transfer deadline day, strikers Juvhel Tsoumou and Alex MacDonald joined on loan deals from Preston North End and Burnley respectively.", "The first game of February was the only League Two game to go ahead that weekend, with adverse weather affecting the majority of the country. Former Argyle manager Paul Sturrock's Southend United were visitors to Home Park, and went 2\u20130 up in the first half through Michael Timlin and Dave Martin. Argyle's resurgent attitude however saw them pull level late on, with goals from Nick Chadwick and debutant Alex MacDonald denying Southend from going top of the table.  A series of 0\u20130 draws at home to Barnet and Dag & Red surrounded Argyle's biggest win of the season, a 4\u20130 triumph away to Accrington Stanley in which Alex MacDonald's first half brace was added to by Darren Purse and Paul Bignot. Argyle travelled to Macclesfield Town's Moss Rose looking to go the whole of February unbeaten, but were disappointed when Conor Hourihane's 71st-minute goal was cancelled out by former Pilgrim Georgie Donnelly in the 95th minute.", "Argyle's form had significantly improved compared to fellow relegation battlers Hereford United, who Argyle travelled to on the 6th of April. An own goal from Dutch defender Stefan Stam gave Argyle the lead, but the Greens failed to extend their lead after a missed penalty from Simon Walton and the inevitable happened when Hereford's Tom Barkhuizen equalised in the second half. An injury to goalkeeper Jake Cole saw Romain Larrieu start and saw Ollie Chenoweth recalled from his loan at Truro City to sit on the bench in a 1\u20130 win at home to Aldershot Town; Alex MacDonald the goalscorer. A visit to historical rivals Swindon Town was next, and despite losing 1\u20130 through an 84th minute Alan Connell goal, results elsewhere meant that Argyle were nearly safe from relegation, with seven points separating them from the bottom two and with three games left to play.", "|align=\"left\"|Alex MacDonald", "|Alex MacDonald"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Alex MacDonald", "|27||FW|| Alex MacDonald || Plymouth Argyle || Loan ||31 August 2012", "|27||FW|| Alex MacDonald || Burton Albion || Loan ||31 January 2013"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 18 June 2013 || MF ||  Alex MacDonald ||  Burnley || Free ||", "| Alex MacDonald", "| 11 || MF ||  || Alex MacDonald || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 0"]}, {"page": "Marcus Harness", "response": ["Harness spent time in the youth team at Coventry City, before switching to Burton Albion.
