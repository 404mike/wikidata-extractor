The group was unable to complete the assigned project, which was abandoned. However, they managed to convince Peter Knight, who had been assigned to arrange and conduct the orchestral interludes, to collaborate on a recording that used the band's original material instead.", "Deram executives were initially sceptical about the hybrid style of the resulting concept album. Released in November 1967, Days of Future Passed peaked at No. 27 on the British LP chart. Five years later it reached No. 3 on the Billboard chart in the US. The LP was a song cycle or concept album that takes place over the course of a single day.  The album drew inspiration in production and arrangement from the pioneering use of the classical instrumentation by the Beatles, to whom Pinder had introduced the mellotron that year. It took the form to new heights using the London Festival Orchestra, a loose affiliation of Decca's classical musicians given a fictitious name, adding the term \"London\" to sound impressive, to provide an orchestral linking framework to the Moodies' already written and performed songs, plus overture and conclusion sections on the album, including backing up Graeme Edge's opening and closing poems recited by Pinder. Strings were added to the latter portion of the album version of Hayward's \"Nights in White Satin\" (absent on the single) but the orchestra and group never performed together on the recording, with the band's rock instrumentation centred on Pinder's mellotron. Despite being a lush concept album, the LP was cut in a very workmanlike manner, with the band recording a particular song, then the track being presented to Peter Knight who quickly composed a suitable \"linking\" orchestral portion, which the Decca musicians (\"London Festival Orchestra\") then recorded. The album was as much an original work by Knight himself as the group. The composing credits were listed on the sleeve as: \"Redwave-Knight\", although Hayward wrote \"Nights...\" and \"Tuesday Afternoon\", Thomas provided \"Another Morning\" and \"Twilight Time\", Lodge penned \"Peak Hour\" and \"Evening (Time To Get Away)\", and Edge contributed the opening and closing poems (the first \"Morning Glory\" and the latter titled \"Late Lament\") read by Mike Pinder who composed both \"The Sun Set\" and \"Dawn is a Feeling\" (sung by Hayward, with Pinder singing the bridge section).", "Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, \"Blue Guitar\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with 10cc backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album The Promise.\"  Edge produced two albums with guitarist Adrian Gurvitz and his brother Paul Gurvitz, Kick Off Your Muddy Boots (1975) and Paradise Ballroom (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured Songwriter (1977), which was followed a few years later by Night Flight (1980), Moving Mountains (1985) (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight), Classic Blue (1989), The View From The Hill (1996) and Live in San Juan Capistrano (1998). Lodge released Natural Avenue (1977); Pinder produced The Promise (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976)."]}, {"page": "1985 in music", "response": ["*July 30 \u2013 Peter Knight, conductor, arranger and composer, 68"]}, {"page": "Exmouth", "response": ["*Peter Knight (1917\u20131985), composer (born in the town)"]}, {"page": "List of music arrangers", "response": ["*Peter Knight"]}, {"page": "Days of Future Passed", "response": ["Recording sessions for the album took place at Decca Studios in West Hampstead, London between 9 May and 3 November 1967.
