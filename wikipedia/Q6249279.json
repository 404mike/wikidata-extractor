A team including Bruce Rioch, John Moore and Graham French won the Fourth Division championship in 1967\u201368 under the leadership of former player Allan Brown; two years later Malcolm Macdonald's goals helped them to another promotion, while comedian Eric Morecambe became a director of the club. Luton Town won promotion back to the First Division in 1973\u201374, but were relegated the following season by a solitary point. Former Luton player David Pleat was made manager in 1978, and by 1982\u201383 the team was back in the top flight. The team which Pleat assembled at Kenilworth Road was notable at the time for the number of black players it included; during an era when many English squads were almost entirely white, Luton often fielded a mostly black team. Talented players such as Ricky Hill, Brian Stein and Emeka Nwajiobi made key contributions to the club's success during this period, causing it to accrue \"a richer history of black stars than any in the country\", in the words of journalist Gavin Willacy.", "On the last day of the 1982\u201383 season, the club's first back in the top tier, it narrowly escaped relegation: playing Manchester City at Maine Road, Luton needed to win to stay up, while City could escape with a draw. A late winner by Yugoslavian substitute Raddy Anti\u0107 saved the team and prompted Pleat to dance across the pitch performing a \"jig of joy\", an image that has become iconic. The club achieved its highest ever league position, seventh, under John Moore in 1986\u201387, and, managed by Ray Harford, won the Football League Cup a year later with a 3\u20132 win over Arsenal. With ten minutes left on the clock and Arsenal 2\u20131 ahead, a penalty save from stand-in goalkeeper Andy Dibble sparked a late Luton rally: Danny Wilson equalised, before Brian Stein scored the winner with the last kick of the match. The club reached the League Cup Final once more in 1988\u201389, but lost 3\u20131 to Nottingham Forest."]}, {"page": "Ray Harford", "response": ["In the summer of 1986, Luton Town manager David Pleat resigned and was replaced by John Moore. Harford was signed by Luton as assistant manager and helped the club finish seventh in the old First Division. At the end of the 1986\u201387 season, Moore resigned as manager and Harford was promoted as his replacement. It proved to be an impressive decision. In his first season as Luton manager, Harford guided the Kenilworth Road club to a 3\u20132 win over Arsenal in the League Cup final \u2013 the club's first ever major trophy. But Luton were forbidden to enter the 1988\u201389 UEFA Cup because the ban on English teams in European competition arising from the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster still had two years to run. They also reached the FA Cup semi-finals that year, losing 2\u20131 to eventual winners Wimbledon \u2013 which made Luton the latest of several clubs to have come close to winning the then elusive domestic cup double."]}, {"page": "John Moore", "response": ["John Moore may refer to:", "*John Moore (painter) (born 1941), American artist", "*John Moore (artist), South African artist", "*John Moore (photographer) (born 1967), American photographer", "*John Moore of Ipswich, (1821\u20131902), painter and decorator", "*John Moore (stage manager) (1814\u20131893), British actor, prompter, and stage manager", "*John Moore (designer) (fl. 1960s), motion picture art director and production designer", "*John Moore (director) (born 1970), film director, producer, and writer", "*John Moore (broadcaster) (born 1966), Canadian broadcaster, actor, and voice actor", "*John Moore (piper) (1834\u20131894), Irish piper", "*Deacon John Moore (born 1941), New Orleans musician and bandleader", "*John Moore (British musician) (born 1964), musician with The Jesus and Mary Chain, Black Box Recorder", "*John Moore (songwriter) (born 1969), songwriter and singer for the Northeast USA band 53 Days", "*John Moore (bluegrass musician), mandolin player", "*John Moore (Manx poet), privateer and poet from the late 18th Century", "*John Moore (Scottish physician) (1729\u20131802), author of the 1789 novel Zeluco and father of General Sir John Moore", "*John Moore (British author) (1907\u20131967), British author and pioneer conservationist", "*John Moore (American author) (born 1959), American author", "*John Moore (1595?\u20131657), English clergyman; authored anti-enclosure pamphlets", "*John Moore (bishop of Ely) (1646\u20131714), British scholar", "*John Moore (Baptist) (1662\u20131726), English Baptist minister from Northampton", "*John Moore (archbishop of Canterbury) (1730\u20131805), Archbishop of Canterbury", "*John Moore (bishop of St. Augustine) (1835\u20131901), Bishop of St. Augustine, Florida, 1877\u20131901", "*John Moore (Methodist bishop) (1867\u20131948), Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South", "*John Moore (bishop of Bauchi) (1942\u20132010), Bishop of Bauchi, Nigeria", "*John Moore (archdeacon of Cloyne), Archdeacon of Cloyne, 1665\u20131687", "*John Moore (Australian judge) (1915\u20131998), President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission", "*John Moore (Australian politician) (born 1936), Australian defence minister under John Howard", "*John Moore (Lower Canada politician) (died 1858), contractor and political figure in Lower Canada", "*John Moore (MP for Dover) (fl. 1584\u20131586), MP for Dover", "*John Moore (regicide) (1599\u20131650), regicide of King Charles I of England", "*John Moore (Lord Mayor) (1620\u20131702), English politician, MP for the City of London, 1685\u20131687", "*John Moore, 1st Baron Moore (died 1725), Irish politician", "*John Moore (1756\u20131834) (1756\u20131834), MP who represented the constituency of Newry", "*John Moore (Irish politician) (1767\u20131799), President of the Province of Connacht, Irish Republic", "*John Moore, Baron Moore of Lower Marsh (1937\u20132019), British Cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher", "*John Moore (Louisiana politician) (1788\u20131867), U.S. Congressman from Louisiana", "*John Moore (Illinois politician) (1793\u20131863), Lieutenant Governor of Illinois", "*John Moore Allison (1905\u20131978), United States Ambassador to Japan, Czechoslovakia and Indonesia", "*John Moore (Mississippi politician) (born 1954), member of the Mississippi House of Representatives", "*John Moore (Nevada politician) (born 1964), former member of the Nevada Assembly", "*Sir John Moore, 1st Baronet (1718\u20131779), British admiral", "*John Moore (British Army officer) (1761\u20131809), British general, a.k.a.
