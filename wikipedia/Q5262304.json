On 2 December, the former player was named as Gary Johnson, who said he was paid \u00a350,000 not to go public with allegations he was sexually abused by Heath. The following day, Chelsea apologised \"profusely\" to Johnson, who later demanded further financial compensation from the club. Also on 3 December, The Independent reported a Chelsea youth player's allegation that Dario Gradi, then Chelsea's assistant manager, visited the player's family's home to \"smooth over\" a complaint of sexual assault against Heath in 1974. Gradi was among the first to be targeted by a FA enquiry, and, in connection with these allegations, Gradi was suspended by the FA on 11 December 2016. Meanwhile, former Chelsea youth goalkeeper Derek Richardson also alleged abuse by Heath. In August 2019, Chelsea's board apologised \"unreservedly\" for allowing Heath, a \"prolific and manipulative sexual abuser\", to operate \"unchallenged\". The apology followed an inquiry led by barrister Charles Geekie QC, who was also critical of former assistant manager Gradi. He was accused of failing to tell senior club staff about a sexual conduct allegation concerning Heath made by the parent of a young player."]}, {"page": "Derek Richardson", "response": ["Derek Richardson may refer to:", "*Derek Richardson (actor) (born 1976), American actor", "*Derek Richardson (footballer) (born 1956), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Derek Richardson"]}, {"page": "Len Cantello Testimonial Match", "response": ["The Cyrille Regis & Laurie Cunningham XI featured Ian Benjamin (Sheffield United), Vernon Hodgson (West Bromwich Albion \u2013 a trialist), Brendon Batson (West Bromwich Albion), Derek Richardson (QPR), Stewart Phillips (Hereford United), George Berry (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Bob Hazell (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Garth Crooks (Stoke City), Winston White (Hereford Utd), Cyrille Regis (West Bromwich Albion), Laurie Cunningham (West Bromwich Albion), Remi Moses (West Bromwich Albion), Valmore Thomas (Hereford United).
