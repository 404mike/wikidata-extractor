Stones with inscriptions were frequently re-used as building materials, and ceramic ostraca require a dry environment to ensure the preservation of the ink on their surfaces. Whereas papyrus rolls and packets were usually stored in boxes for safekeeping, ostraca were routinely discarded in waste pits; one such pit was discovered by chance at the Ramesside-era village of Deir el-Medina, and has yielded the majority of known private letters on ostraca. Documents found at this site include letters, hymns, fictional narratives, recipes, business receipts, and wills and testaments.. Penelope Wilson describes this archaeological find as the equivalent of sifting through a modern landfill or waste container. She notes that the inhabitants of Deir el-Medina were incredibly literate by ancient Egyptian standards, and cautions that such finds only come \"...in rarefied circumstances and in particular conditions.\"; see also ."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["*Penelope Wilson, British Egyptologist"]}, {"page": "List of female Egyptologists", "response": ["| Penelope Wilson"]}, {"page": "List of women anthropologists", "response": ["| Penelope Wilson"]}]}}
