For instance, at one point a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only \"you are...\". He demurs, saying his face is not quite right for \"him\", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan, after she puts on her glasses, agreeing that Lennon doesn't \"look like him at all\", and Lennon saying to himself that \"she looks more like him than I do\". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: \"Uh, no, I'm a mocker\", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. In the original interview Ringo admits he borrowed the line from John. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a \"clean old man\" sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a \"dirty old man\"."]}, {"page": "Not Only...
