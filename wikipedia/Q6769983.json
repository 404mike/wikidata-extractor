The series was primarily presented by scientist Brian Cox and comedian and amateur astronomer Dara \u00d3 Briain with support from TV presenter and biochemist Liz Bonnin and astronomer Mark Thompson. For the first six series, the show was broadcast from Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, and featured live links from scientific facilities in Hawaii, South Africa, Norway and NASA. The seventh series in 2017 was broadcast from Siding Spring Observatory in Australia, and a special episode filmed at Kennedy Space Center was broadcast in July 2019 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.", "| Jonathan Ross is shown how to use a telescope, Brian Cox explains why planets are spheres, Hawaii becomes home to Liz Bonnin, who talks about Mars and Mark Thompson gives tips on how to take brilliant night photographs.", "| Brian Cox talks to the astronauts on board the International Space Station, Mark Thompson gives amateur stargazers a chance to watch the Quadrantid Meteor Shower, Liz Bonnin looks at night skies from Hawaii, Dara \u00d3 Briain goes on top of the Lovell Telescope at their HQ in Jodrell Bank Observatory and tries to experience what an astronaut does.", "| Brian Cox and Dara \u00d3 Briain speak to commander of the Apollo 17 mission Eugene Cernan, Mark Thompson presents a guide to show which telescopes amateurs should use, Liz Bonnin is at SALT in South Africa, and viewers are given the chance to find their own exo-planets.", "| Brian Cox explains how black holes are formed, Liz Bonnin is at SALT in South Africa, Mark Thompson takes four budding astronomers from the light polluted skies of London to a dark spot, Dara \u00d3 Briain explains the live switch off, UFOs are explained and the team from the University run an animation to show the beginning of the Universe.", "| The team hunt for aliens, viewers discover a new planet, Dara \u00d3 Briain and Brian Cox hear the sound of a far off object, Mark Thompson convinces a whole town to switch off their lights live, Liz Bonnin shows off South African telescopes, information about mankind deep in space is explained and Dara \u00d3 Briain hears music from the Universe.", "| Dara O Briain and Professor Brian Cox celebrate our amazing night sky. They kick things off with the search for evidence of life on Mars and ask viewers for help to explore an uncharted area of the red planet's surface. Liz Bonnin reports live from NASA mission control to find out the latest findings of the Curiosity Rover, whilst Mark Thompson offers tips on how to observe the moons of Jupiter.", "| Dara and Brian's journey through the night sky continues with a look into the distant past, explaining how it is possible to chart the history of the universe by looking million of light years out into the depths of space. Meanwhile, Mark Thompson reveals what can be learned from the colours of the stars. At NASA, Liz Bonnin meets the team building the largest space telescope in the world, an instrument that's 100 times more powerful than the Hubble.", "| Dara O Briain and Professor Brian Cox explain how activity on the Sun distorts the Earth's magnetic field and creates the aurorae. The show coincided with a large coronal mass ejection which resulted in a spectacular display on the third night of the series. Liz Bonnin is in Tromso, Norway showing live pictures of the aurora. Mark Thompson is in Norfolk with the local astronomical societies. Carolyn Porco, head of the Cassini mission imaging team, is a guest at Jodrell Bank and they show Cassini movies of aurorae on Saturn. Viewers are invited to participate in examining 40,000 images of galaxies to identify galaxies which gravitationally lens light from far distant galaxies behind them - the aim was for 500,000 images to be examined in two days; in fact this target was met before the end of that evenings' \"Stargazing Live: Back to Earth\"!", "| Dara and Brian are thrilled to have two of their heroes as guests tonight - Commander Walter Cunningham of Apollo 7, and Commander Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station. Liz Bonnin takes to the air to view the aurora from 30,000 feet, above the clouds in Norway. Mark Thompson explains how to view satellites in space from Earth. Dara experiences weightlessness on a \"vomit comet\" aircraft flight. ", "| The search for hidden galaxies started on the first night has been extremely successful - more than 50 gravitational lenses were discovered in two days, and some of the world's largest telescopes have been tasked with verifying viewers' discoveries. Brian explains how we work out what the shape of our Galaxy looks like. Dara endures the G-forces experienced by astronauts during a launch in a training centrifuge. Mark Thompson demonstrates how to navigate a boat across the English Channel only using the stars. There is a discussion on exoplanets.
