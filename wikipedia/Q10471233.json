He made his debut in a wartime match against Crystal Palace. In 1943, he was called into service and served in the Royal Artillery and saw action in France, Belgium and Germany.\nAt the end of the war, Hernon resumed his football career at Leicester, and in 1948, he was sold to Bolton Wanderers for a \u00a316,000 transfer fee \u2013 which was Britain's second-highest transfer fee at the time. Hernon spent three years at Burnden Park, before being signed by Grimsby Town manager Bill Shankly in 1951 for a \u00a32,500 transfer fee.\nIn 1954, after three years at Grimsby, Hernon moved to Watford, where he spent two seasons before a knee injury forced him to retire from the professional game. He later resumed his career at non-league Hastings United, before injuries forced him to quit the game for good in 1957.\nAfter retiring from football, Hernon settled in Hastings, and went on to become a salesman, chauffeur and school caretaker. He died on 7 March 2009, aged 84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2009 in association football", "response": ["* 7 March \u2013 Jimmy Hernon (84), Scottish midfielder"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 in English football", "response": ["*7 March 2009 \u2013 Jimmy Hernon, 84, former winger who played for Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers, Grimsby Town and Watford.Mariners legend dies at 84 Grimsby Telegraph.
