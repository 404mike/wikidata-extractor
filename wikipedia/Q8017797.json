By 1853, William, who spent unwisely seeking to establish himself in fashionable society, was already in debt and launched a sequence of deceptions and forgeries, dishonestly to obtain much of his father's property. In particular, he forged a deed conveying Norbiton Estate to himself and then sold it to Mr Waite. Further, he destroyed his father's will, which had left much of his property to William's brother Richard, and forged a will leaving it to William's mother, with himself as executor.Harris (2001) pp36-40 His father died in 1856 and in 1857 William was elected Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Lambeth.Harris (2001) p.41"]}, {"page": "Frederick Doulton", "response": ["Frederick had first stood unsuccessfully for Lambeth in 1852 where he had adopted a platform critical of lavish campaigns and corrupt and unfair voting.
