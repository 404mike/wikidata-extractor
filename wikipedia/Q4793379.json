Moore and Yuan Chang at Columbia University), working together with Ethel Cesarman, isolated Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8) using representational difference analysis. This search was prompted by work from Valerie Beral and colleagues who inferred from the epidemic of Kaposi's sarcoma among patients with AIDS that this cancer must be caused by another infectious agent besides HIV, and that this was likely to be a second virus. Subsequent studies revealed that KSHV is the \"KS agent\" and is responsible for the epidemiologic patterns of KS and related cancers. In 2008 Yuan Chang and Patrick S. Moore developed a new method to identify cancer viruses based on computer subtraction of human sequences from a tumor transcriptome, called digital transcriptome subtraction (DTS). DTS was used to isolate DNA fragments of Merkel cell polyomavirus from a Merkel cell carcinoma and it is now believed that this virus causes 70\u201380% of these cancers."]}, {"page": "North Sydney Girls High School", "response": ["*Dame Valerie Beralbreast cancer epidemiologist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Sydney people", "response": ["* Dame Valerie Beral (graduated with first-class honours in both medicine and surgery, 1969) \u2013 epidemiologist; Fellow of the Royal Society; Head of Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford and Cancer Research UK since 1989Sydney Morning Herald of 14 June 2010"]}, {"page": "Million Women Study", "response": ["The Million Women Study is a study of women\u2019s health analysing data from more than one million women aged 50 and over, led by Dame Valerie Beral and a team of researchers at the Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford.
