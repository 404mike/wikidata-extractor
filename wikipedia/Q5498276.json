On the other hand, Francesco Antommarchi, Napoleon's personal physician, despised the English, considered their touch \"polluting\", and may never have used their yardstick to measure his emperor.

Some historians believe that the reason for the mistake about his size at death came from use of an obsolete French yardstick.
