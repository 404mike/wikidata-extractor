His first description in 1832 used the name Psittacus purpureus, a name preoccupied by a description of another species. The specific epithet derived from the Ancient Greek words  \"purple\" and  \"head\". Alternate common names include porphyry-crowned lorikeet, Dietrichsen's lory, and Zit parrot, from its shrill call."]}]}}
