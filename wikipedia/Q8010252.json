He established his manufactury at Endell Street, Covent Garden, in 1859 and subsequently worked with many of the foremost English stained glass designers.\nSaunders established a long partnership with the architect William Burges, working with him on many of his major commissions, including Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cardiff Castle, Castell Coch and Burges's Yorkshire churches. David Lawrence and Ann Wilson consider Burges was particularly indebted to Saunders: \"his technique [gave] Burges's glass its most distinctive characteristic, namely the flesh colour.  This is unique, had no precedents and has had no imitators.\"  Lawrence and Wilson's history of St Fin Barre's has detailed commentaries on the glass there, of which Lawrence writes, \"The impact created by all these glowing, coloured religious images is overwhelming and intoxicating.  To enter St Fin Barre's Cathedral is an experience unparalleled in Ireland and rarely matched anywhere.\"In 1880, Saunders handed the company over to his assistant William Worral and retired abroad, \"apparently ceasing all artistic activity, at least in this country (although) he lived for (another) 40 years.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral", "response": ["Burges conceived the iconographical scheme for the stained glass windows, designed the individual panels for the each of the 74 windows, and oversaw every stage of their production. According to Maurice Carey, \"in consequence, the windows have a consistent cohesive style and follow a logical sequence in subject matter\". The panels were cartooned by H.\u00a0W. Lonsdale and manufactured in London between 1868 and 1869 by William Gualbert Saunders, who worked in Burges' office before forming his own firm of stained glass makers. Doctrinal objections to some of the figures, particularly of Christ, lead to a delay of four years, with their eventual installation between 1873 and 1881. Four windows remain incomplete. Lonsdale's cartoons are kept at the cathedral."]}, {"page": "William Burges", "response": ["William Gualbert Saunders joined the Buckingham Street team in 1865 and worked with Burges on the development of the design and techniques of stained-glass manufacture, producing much of the best glass for Saint Fin Barre's. Ceccardo Egidio Fucigna was another long-time collaborator who sculpted the Madonna and Child above the drawbridge at Castell Coch, the figure of St John over the mantelpiece in Lord Bute's bedroom at Cardiff Castle and the bronze Madonna in the roof garden. Lastly, there was Axel Haig, a Swedish-born illustrator, who prepared many of the watercolour perspectives with which Burges entranced his clients. Crook calls them \"a group of talented men, moulded in their master's image, art-architects and medievalists to a man\u00a0\u2013 jokers and jesters too\u00a0\u2013 devoted above all to art rather than to business.\""]}, {"page": "Saunders", "response": ["** William Gualbert Saunders (1837\u20131923), English designer of stained glass"]}, {"page": "William Saunders", "response": ["* William Gualbert Saunders (1837\u20131923), English designer of stained glass"]}, {"page": "Church of St Peter, Carrigrohane", "response": ["The church, in a Gothic Revival style, has a three-bay nave with a two-stage tower and gable-fronted porch.
