A third album, In Dub, was released in 2002.\nHe is also the founder of the label Twisted Records and works in the electronic groups Younger Brother and Shpongle. Younger Brother initially began as a side project of Posford and Benji Vaughan and represented a transition away from previous projects which emphasized a more synthesized style.Though his music has been self-described as \"heavily driven by psychedelica\", he always performs while sober due to the complexities of operating many computers and mixers during his events.His grandfather, George Posford, was a notable composer and producer in the United Kingdom in the 1930s.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rave", "response": ["* Goa trance / Psychedelic trance \u2013 Alien Project, Electric Universe, Hallucinogen, Infected Mushroom, Astral Projection"]}, {"page": "Psychedelic trance", "response": ["In 1993 the first 100% Goa trance album was released, Project II Trance, featuring tracks by Man With No Name and Hallucinogen to name two.
