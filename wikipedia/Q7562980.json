Speaking in an interview with Aesthetica magazine in 2009, Cooke has said that her work is primarily concerned with questions of truth. She has developed the notion of truth as a depreciable asset. Cooke's work deals with the concealment of truth on various levels, from personal self-deceptions to governments misleading the public. She is the author of the novels The Glass House and Under The Mountain.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Sophie Cooke (born 1976, S)"]}, {"page": "Kilmahog", "response": ["*Kilmahog was used as the inspiration for the main setting in the novel \"Under the Mountain\" by Sophie Cooke."]}, {"page": "Kirby Wright", "response": ["Wright was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.  He is of English-Irish-Italian-Hawaiian heritage. His European roots are in Cork, Ireland, Nelson, England, and Genoa, Italy. His father, Harold S. Wright, was a corporate attorney for the firm Smith Wild BeeBe & Cades.  His mother, the former June McCormack of Boston, was a secretary at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT.  Starting at the age of four, Wright spent summers with his part-Hawaiian grandmother Julia Gilman on her ranch on the east end of Molokai.  It was here that Wright met Sophie Cooke, a cattle rancher who wrote the memoir Sincerely, Sophie about her life and times on the islands.  This meeting proved influential to the young Wright because Cooke wrote about his grandmother.  Evidence of Wright's love for the written word surfaced at the Star of the Sea Elementary School in Honolulu, where he crafted and performed plays about vampires, pro wrestlers, and secret agents.  Kirby Wright won first place in a recital competition for his reading of \"Trees\" by Joyce Kilmer and also won awards for his original poems."]}, {"page": "Hal Duncan", "response": ["On 6 September 2011 Hal Duncan took part in a \"Literary Death Match\" in Edinburgh.
