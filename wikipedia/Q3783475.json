She first appeared on stage at the age of six at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, and performed in Dover, Richmond and Margate in her childhood. At the age of 15 she eloped with, and on 2 September 1805 married, John Faucit Savill; shortly afterwards they appeared on stage at Margate and then Dover and as \"Mr & Mrs Faucit\". They had six children, including Helena or Helen Faucit (1817-1898), a celebrated actress.In 1813 she appeared as Desdemona at Covent Garden Theatre on 7 October, her London debut, and she played Cleopatra there on 15 November. For the next twenty years she performed at Covent Garden, the Haymarket Theatre and Drury Lane. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography summarises her acting career thus:\n\nMrs Faucit was very successful in certain comic parts (such as Celia in The Humourous Lieutenant) and as the heroine of melodramas and musical plays. Her serious acting, which seemed meretricious in characters such as Lady Macbeth, was genuinely affecting in Meg Merrilies and similar roles; her handsome face and Junoesque figure were assets in regal parts such as Elizabeth in Richard III, Gertrude in Hamlet, and the empress in The Exile.\nIn 1821 she sought an annulment of her marriage, unsuccessfully; she left her husband for William Farren (1786-1861), whom she married in 1853 after her first husband's death. He had two sons, actors Henry Farren (1826?-1860) and William (1825-1908); while the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that these were Harriet's sons, the records of the Garrick Club Collections describe them as the sons of \"an unknown woman (his first wife?)\".She died in London on 16 June 1853.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Farren", "response": ["He played at Covent Garden every winter until 1828, and began in 1824 a series of summer engagements at the Haymarket which also lasted some years. At these two theatres he played an immense variety of comedic characters. After 1821, he separated from his first wife and began living with Harriet Elizabeth Savill, who was at the time married to John Saville Faucit. After an unsuccessful attempt to annul the marriage, Farren and Savill lived together under common law marriage, though they did not marry formally until Saville's death in 1853. Farren and his brother played important roles in training Savill's daughter, Helen Faucit, for her successful acting career."]}, {"page": "Saville", "response": ["* Harriet Elizabeth Savill or Saville  (1789\u20131857), English actress, wife of John Faucit"]}, {"page": "Helena Faucit", "response": ["Born in London, she was the daughter of actors John Saville Faucit and Harriet Elizabeth Savill.
