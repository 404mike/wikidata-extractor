He came close to joining Torquay United on loan, but stayed at Brentford after Mark Phillips picked up an injury. Legge scored his first goal at Griffin Park on 28 November, which was the only goal of the FA Cup Second Round game against Walsall and helped to earn him the FA's \"Player of the Round\" award. One month later he signed a contract extension, keeping him at Brentford until at least the end of the 2010\u201311 season, with manager Andy Scott saying that \"Leon has improved since he's been with us and has the potential to improve\". The following month, on 26 January, he scored his first league goal, providing the late equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw with Southampton. Two months later, on 23 March, he scored again in a 3\u20133 draw against Colchester United.
