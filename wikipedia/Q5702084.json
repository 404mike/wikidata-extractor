Based on the 2001 novel of the same name by Helen Cross, the film explores the romantic relationship between two young women from different classes and backgrounds. Working class Mona (Natalie Press), whose once-hotheaded brother Phil (Paddy Considine) became a born-again Christian in prison, meets upper middle class Tamsin (Emily Blunt, in her theatrical film debut) who suffers from a lack of love in her family. Filmed in West Yorkshire, the film went on to win a BAFTA.", "The novel of the same title, My Summer of Love by Helen Cross, only served as a blueprint for the film. Whereas the novel pays a lot of attention to the social background of England in the 1980s, Pawlikowski focused on the relationship between the girls. Most of the characters in the novel were left out in the film and the character Phil was invented and added by Pawlikowski, who had previously directed a documentary on born-again Christians in Yorkshire. In many interviews Pawlikowski said that he was not interested in portraying typical teenage life in England, but he wanted to give the movie a certain \"timeless feeling\"."]}, {"page": "Betty Trask Award", "response": ["* Helen Cross for My Summer of Love - \u00a32,000"]}, {"page": "Erotic Review", "response": ["*Helen Cross  "]}, {"page": "My Summer of Love (novel)", "response": ["My Summer Of Love is a novel by Helen Cross, first published in Great Britain in 2001, winning a Betty Trask Award in the subsequent year."]}, {"page": "Cross (surname)", "response": ["*Helen Cross (author) (born 1967), English author", "*Helen Cross (politician), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "Helen (given name)", "response": ["* Helen Cross (born 1967), English author", "* Helen Cross, Australian politician"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["*Helen Cross (author)"]}, {"page": "List of LGBT-related films of 2004", "response": ["|My Summer of Love ||  || United Kingdom || Drama, romance, thriller || Natalie Press, Emily Blunt, Paddy Considine, Dean Andrews, Michelle Byrne, Paul-Anthony Barber, Lynette Edwards and Kathryn Sumner || Based on the novel of the same name by Helen Cross"]}, {"page": "Helen Cross", "response": ["Helen Cross may refer to:", "* Helen Cross (author) (born 1967), English author", "* Helen Cross (politician), Australian politician", "* Helen Cross (physician), British paediatric doctor and research professor"]}, {"page": "BBC Audio Drama Awards", "response": ["| Innovation AwardPresented by Niamh Cusack || The Unfortunates adapted by Graham WhiteProducer: Mary Peate (Radio 3) || Blue Eyed Boy by Helen CrossProducer: Mary Ward-Lowery (BBC Bristol, Radio 4)Wild HackneyProducer: Francesca Panetta (Hackney Podcast)"]}]}}
