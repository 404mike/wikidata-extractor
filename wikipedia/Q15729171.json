This, unlike many rivalries, is generally friendly as both sets of fans live and work together given their close geographic locations.  Due to the geographical proximity of the clubs and despite the rivalry, Inverness CT have signed many former Ross County players over the years, including Barry Wilson, Stuart Golabek, Roy McBain, Graham Bayne, Richard Hastings, Steven Hislop, John Rankin, Andrew Barrowman, Lionel Djebi-Zadi and Don Cowie. Many former Inverness CT players have also \"crossed the bridge\" in the opposite direction, most notably Grant Munro, Michael Fraser,  Ross Tokely and Coll Donaldson in recent years. Both Stuart Golabek and Andy Barrowman had two spells at County each, with the former also having two spells at ICT. A notable player is Iain Vigurs, who is one of (if not the first) few player(s) to cross the bridge more than twice, having spent two spells with both County and Caley Thistle."]}, {"page": "1995 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 9 April \u2013 Coll Donaldson, footballer"]}, {"page": "Highland derby", "response": ["* Coll Donaldson "]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Greenock Morton F.C. season", "response": ["|Simon Mensing   Marc McNulty    Kyle Wilkie   Coll Donaldson   Burton O'Brien "]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Coll Donaldson", "|  Coll Donaldson", "|align=left| Coll Donaldson|| 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Livingston F.C. season", "response": ["| Coll Donaldson"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| 10 July 2015 || CB ||  || Coll Donaldson ||  || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["|28||||DF||Coll Donaldson||4||1||0||0||1||0||5||1", "| 13 July 2015 ||  Coll Donaldson ||  Queens Park Rangers || Free"]}, {"page": "This Girl (Cookin' on 3 Burners song)", "response": ["In 2016, British online department store Littlewoods included the song in a TV advertising campaign.
