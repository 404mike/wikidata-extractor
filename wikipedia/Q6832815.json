Its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: Michael Meyer argued that the play's theme is not women's rights, but rather \"the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person.\"Meyer (1967, 478). In a speech given to the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he \"must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement,\" since he wrote \"without any conscious thought of making propaganda,\" his task having been \"the description of humanity.\"Ibsen, \"Speech at the Festival of the Norwegian Women's Rights League, Christiana\", 26 May 1898; in Dukore (1974, 563); see also Moi (2006, 229\u2013230). However, the play is associated with feminism, as Miriam Schneir includes it in her anthology Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings, labelling it as one of the essential feminist works."]}, {"page": "Henrik Ibsen", "response": ["When Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, his father's fortunes took a turn for the worse, and in 1835 the family was forced to sell Altenburgg\u00e5rden. The following year they moved to their stately summer house, , outside of the city.Michael Meyers. Henrik Ibsen, Chapter one. They were still relatively affluent, had servants and socialised with other members of the Skien elite, e.g. through lavish parties; their closest neighbours on Southern Venst\u00f8p were former shipowner and mayor of Skien Ulrich Frederik Cudrio and his family, who also had been forced to sell their townhouse. In 1843, after Henrik left home, the Ibsen family moved to a townhouse at Snipetorp, owned by Knud Ibsen's half-brother and former apprentice Christopher, who had established himself as an independent merchant in Skien in 1836 and who eventually become one of the city's leading shipowners. Knud continued to struggle to maintain his business and had some success in the 1840s, but in the 1850s his business ventures and professional activities came to an end, and he became reliant on the support from his successful younger half-brothers.", "Many Ibsen scholars have compared characters and themes in his plays to his family and upbringing; his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society. Ibsen himself confirmed that he both modelled and named characters in his plays after his own family.Michael Meyers. Henrick Ibsen. Chapter one.Hans Bernhard Jaeger, Henrik Ibsen, 1828\u20131888: et liter\u00e6rt livsbillede, Copenhagen, Gyldendal, 1888 However, Haave criticizes the uncritical use of Ibsen's dramas as biographical sources and the \"naive\" readings of them as reflections of his family members.", "Ibsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a realism which was to be adopted by Chekhov and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of William Archer and Edmund Gosse. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel Stephen Hero. Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.. Michael Meyer's translations in the 1950s were welcomed by actors and directors as playable, rather than academic. As The Times newspaper put it, 'This, one may think, is how Ibsen might have expressed himself in English'.", "On 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in Kristiania (now Oslo)since 2006 The Ibsen Museum (Oslo) after a series of strokes in March 1900.

They return to Denmark to King Harald Bluetooth's court where Orm meets Ylva. Orm later returns to Scania with Rapp. Orm and Rapp join a Viking party raiding England again after a brief period of peace in that area following the reconquest of the Danelaw in the mid-10th century by King Edgar, Ethelred's father.
