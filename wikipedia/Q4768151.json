The top of the slats were painted green and from the air, it appeared green when closed. Strong elastic held the slats closed and the operator could pull a cord against the tension of the elastic, to open the blind, showing a white background. The person on the ground could open the panel for a short time, indicating a \"dot\" in Morse code, or a longer time, indicating a \"dash\", and thereby had a method of producing a message. If the aircraft located the panel, the air crew could be able to read a message sent by the ground operator. It was aided with a numerical code system, with white numbers in broad strips. One example of a pre-arranged code was \"XII\", meaning \"\"come again tomorrow\". Andrew Roe described a type that were made from dark blue waterproof American cloth. It weighed around  and was about  in size, with a white T-shape stitched on. Branching off were further white panels with dark blue flaps, which were numbered one to nine."]}]}}
