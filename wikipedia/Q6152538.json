The King hoped that these teachers would \"render her an honour and comfort to her relations, and a blessing to the dominions over which she may hereafter preside\".  According to Holme, this instruction made little impression on Charlotte, who chose to learn only what she wanted to learn.  Taught by composer Jane Mary Guest, Charlotte became an accomplished pianist."]}, {"page": "List of women composers by birth date", "response": ["* Jane Mary Guest (c. 1762\u20131846)"]}, {"page": "1783 in music", "response": ["*Jane Mary Guest \u2013 6 Sonatas, Op. 1"]}, {"page": "List of Classical-era composers", "response": ["*Jane Mary Guest (1762\u20131846)"]}, {"page": "Miles (surname)", "response": ["* Jane Mary Miles, married name of Jane Mary Guest (c. 1762 \u2013 1846), English composer and pianist"]}, {"page": "Maria Hester Park", "response": ["Before her marriage, Maria Hester Park gave four well-received performances, mostly in the Oxford area,Schleifer, p. 118. on both the piano and the harpsichord.Wollenberg, p. 284.

She played a Clementi duet with Jane Mary Guest on 29 April 1783, a concerto at Willis's Rooms in March 1784 and a performance as Mrs Park (\"late Reynolds\") in May 1791. After her marriage in London in April 1787 to Thomas Park, an engraver turned antiquarian and man of letters, she ended her career as a performer, although she earned even more fame as composer and teacher. Her marriage appears to have been happy; several of her husband's love poems to her still exist. She corresponded with Joseph Haydn, who, on 22 October 1794, sent her a sonata of his composition (Hob. XVI:51) and a thank you letter in exchange for two of her pieces. She died in Hampstead, London at the age of 53, after many years of ill health.
