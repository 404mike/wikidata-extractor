When in 1969 Rhodesia declared itself a republic, with a racist constitution, Prof. Miller resigned his position and returned to the UK, joining the University of Reading as visiting professor, before being appointed Director of the newly formed Polytechnic of North London in 1971.\nMiller was one of a number of distinguished geologists who contributed to the UK's 2nd World War effort, as Major T.G.
