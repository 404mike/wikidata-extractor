He primarily plays as a Centre but can also cover Fullback.\nHopper started playing mini rugby at age 10 and continued through school and in the junior teams of the Exeter Chiefs, following in the footsteps of his father Keith who captained Exeter during the 1960s. He also played for Wessex and, while studying, for Cardiff University. After graduation Matt spent a year in Australia and played for Manly, before returning to the UK and joining Plymouth Albion.\nFollowing two years with Plymouth, Hopper joined Cornish Pirates in 2010. Pirates were defeated over the two legs of the 2010\u201311 RFU Championship Final by Worcester, but the team's dynamic playing style had attracted attention from several Premiership clubs and Hopper was recruited to join Harlequins in April 2011.Hopper made his competitive debut for Quins against Sale Sharks in round 5 of the Aviva Premiership and gained his first start against Gloucester in the Heineken Cup, scoring a try. An injury to George Lowe gave Matt a run in the first XV and he played seven full matches during December 2011 and January 2012, including an away victory against French giants Toulouse. Hopper impressed many during this period and was rewarded with a call up to Stuart Lancaster's Saxons squad to face the Irish Wolfhounds on 28 January 2012.He was a replacement for Harlequins in their 2011\u201312 Premiership final victory over Leicester Tigers.ON 13 April 2017, Hopper to leave Harlequins and join French club Oyonnax in the Top 14 from the 2017\u201318 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Swift (singer-songwriter)", "response": ["*Matt Hopper \u2013 Jersey Finger (2010)"]}, {"page": "Exeter School", "response": ["*Matt Hopper, professional rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2001 Big 12 Conference Baseball Tournament", "response": ["| Matt Hopper"]}, {"page": "Bjorn Basson", "response": ["Basson joined French Top 14 side  in December 2017, signing as a medical joker for the injured Matt Hopper."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Premiership Rugby", "response": ["|CE ||23|| Matt Hopper", "|CE ||23|| Matt Hopper"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 RFU Championship", "response": ["|OC ||13|| Matt Hopper", "|OC ||13|| Matt Hopper", "|OC ||13|| Matt Hopper"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Cornish Pirates RFC season", "response": ["* Matt Hopper (to  Harlequins) "]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Cornish Pirates season", "response": ["|OC ||13|| Matt Hopper", "|OC ||13|| Matt Hopper", "|OC ||13|| Matt Hopper"]}, {"page": "Hopper (surname)", "response": ["*Matt Hopper (born 1985), English rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "List of 2017\u201318 Premiership Rugby transfers", "response": ["*  Matt Hopper to  Oyonnax"]}, {"page": "List of 2017\u201318 Top 14 transfers", "response": ["* Matt Hopper from  Harlequins"]}, {"page": "Leicester Tigers in cup finals", "response": ["|CE ||23|| Matt Hopper"]}]}}
