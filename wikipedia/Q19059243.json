He was born in Clapham, then in Surrey, and died at Ambleside, then within Westmorland.\nReynolds was educated at the Liverpool Institute and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he played as a lower middle order batsman and a bowler for Liverpool Cricket Club in non-first-class matches from 1848; neither his bowling nor his batting style are known. At Cambridge, he played in four first-class matches, and two of them were the University Matches of 1853 and 1854 against Oxford University; Oxford won both of those games convincingly.\nReynolds graduated from Cambridge University in 1855 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was ordained as a deacon in the Church of England and served as curate of Trinity Church, Stockton-on-Tees from 1855 to 1862. From 1863 to 1876, Reynolds held various posts as a schoolmaster at St Peter's College, Radley, Clifton College and Haileybury College. He then retired to the Lake District where he was Master of Foxhounds of the Coniston pack and had a reputation for other sports, including sailing and ice-skating; his merits in these and more clerical pursuits were the subject of some ill-tempered correspondence in the Yorkshire Post after his death in 1908.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Reynolds (disambiguation)", "response": ["Edward Reynolds was a bishop and author.", "Edward Reynolds may also refer to:", "*Edward Reynolds (MP), MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis", "*Edward Reynolds (cricketer) (1830\u20131908), English clergyman, schoolmaster and cricketer", "*Edward Reynolds (American politician) (1856\u20131938), Maine politician", "*Edward Reynolds (Australian politician) (1892\u20131971), Australian politician", "*Edward Reynolds (priest), son of the bishop"]}]}}
