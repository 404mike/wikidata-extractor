His early life was that of an adventurer, his later was passed chiefly within the \"rules\" of the King's Bench Prison. He is chiefly remembered as the author of The Three Tours of Doctor Syntax, a comic poem, illustrated by artist Thomas Rowlandson's color plates, that satirised William Gilpin. Combe also wrote a series of imaginary letters, supposed to have been written by the second, or \"wicked\" Lord Lyttelton. Of a similar kind were his letters between Swift and \"Stella\". He also wrote the letterpress for various illustrated books, and was a general hack.", "link_mentions": {}}}
