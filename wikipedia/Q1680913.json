If every term of every definiens must itself be defined, \"where at last should we stop?\"Locke, Essay, Bk. III, Ch. iv, 5This problem parallels the diallelus, but leads to scepticism about meaning rather than knowledge. A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of lexical definitions, must resort to circularity.Generally lexicographers seek to avoid circularity wherever possible, but the definitions of words such as \"the\" and \"a\" use those words and are therefore circular.   Lexicographer Sidney I. Landau's essay \"Sexual Intercourse in American College Dictionaries\" provides other examples of circularity in dictionary definitions. (McKean, p. 73\u201377)An exercise suggested by J. L. Austin involved taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. Then, iterating this process until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a \"family circle\" of words relating to the key concept.(A plea for excuses in Philosophical Papers. Ed. J. O.

He took the doctrines of Zeno and Cleanthes and crystallized them into what became the definitive system of Stoicism. He elaborated the physical doctrines of the Stoics and their theory of knowledge and he created much of their formal logic. In short, Chrysippus made the Stoic system what it was.

Urmson and Marina Bissau, records Austin's lectures on this topic. In this book, Austin offers examples for each type of performative mentioned above. For explicit performative, he mentioned \"I apologize\", \"I criticize\" (Page 83), which are so explicit to receivers that it would not make sense for someone to ask \"Does he really mean that?\". Inexplicit performatives are the opposite, where the receiver will have understandable doubts. For a primary performative, the example Austin gave is \"I shall be there\". Compared with explicit performatives, there is uncertainty in implicit performatives. People might ask if he or she is promising to be there with primary performatives, however, this uncertainty is not strong enough as in explicit performatives. Most examples given are explicit because they are easy to identify and observe, and identifying other performatives requires comparison and contrast with explicit performatives.Crimson, J.O, and Marina Bissau.

Its earliest forms are associated with the work of G.E.

In its earlier stages, contemporaries of Wittgenstein at Cambridge University such as Norman Malcolm, Alice Ambrose, Friedrich Waismann, Oets Kolk Bouwsma and Morris Lazerowitz started to develop ideas recognisable as ordinary language philosophy. These ideas were further elaborated from 1945 onwards through the work of some Oxford University philosophers led initially by Gilbert Ryle, then followed by J. L. Austin. This Oxford group also included H. L. A. Hart, Geoffrey Warnock, J. O. Urmson and P. F. Strawson.
