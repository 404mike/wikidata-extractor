During this time he maintained food imports from America and organised a programme of free school meals. Due to a shortage of meat, fish and dairy products, his recommended dish was the vegetarian Woolton pie.\nIn 1943, Woolton was appointed Minister of Reconstruction, planning for post-war Britain, and became Conservative Party chairman from 1946 to 1955.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conservative Party (UK)", "response": ["The success of the Conservative Party in reorganising itself was validated by its victory at the 1951 general election. Winston Churchill, the party leader, brought in a Party chairman to modernise the creaking institution. Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton, was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party chairman 1946\u201355, he rebuilt the local organisations with an emphasis on membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Woolton emphasised rhetoric that characterised the opponents as \"Socialist\" rather than \"Labour\". The libertarian influence of Professor Friedrich Hayek's 1944 best-seller Road to Serfdom was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter-century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.Blake, Robert.
