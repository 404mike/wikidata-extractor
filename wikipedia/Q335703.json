He maintained food imports from America, kept prices down and organised a programme of free school meals. With a shortage of meat, fish and dairy products, his recommended dish was the vegetarian Woolton pie, for which he would always be remembered.\nIn 1943, Woolton was appointed Minister of Reconstruction, planning for post-war Britain, and became Conservative Party chairman from 1946 to 1955. He was given credit for the Conservative victory in 1951.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
