Becoming examines the photographs taken by Clementina Maude, Viscountess Hawarden of her daughters, and reads them for sensual and erotic content. Susan Freeman, writing for the Journal of Women's History, summarized the book as \"a theoretical and provocative examination of female photographers and their subjects, mother-daughter relationships, pleasure, and same-sex sexuality\". The Village Voice praised Mavor's \"real flair for evoking and elucidating individual images\" but criticized her \"tendency to fall into erotic flights of fancy\", ultimately concluding that \"Mavor's analytic foibles far outweigh her strengths\". The Times Literary Supplement also found fault with Mavor's \"single-minded\" interpretations, and noted that the book \"shows no interest in how Hawarden herself might have viewed her photography\"."]}, {"page": "Clementina (given name)", "response": ["* Clementina Maude, Viscountess Hawarden (1822-1865), English portrait amateur photographer"]}]}}
