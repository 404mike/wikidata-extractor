Played by Dominic Monaghan, Charlie was a regular character in the first three seasons, and continued to make occasional appearances until the final season.\nCharlie is introduced as one of the main characters in the pilot episode. Flashbacks from the series show that prior to the plane crash, Charlie was a member of a rock band named Drive Shaft. Initially, Charlie battles with an addiction to heroin. He ultimately achieves sobriety, while establishing a romantic relationship with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and acting as a father figure to Claire's son Aaron. In addition, Charlie also develops close friendships with Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia), and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick).\nIn season three of the show, Charlie begins to face his inevitable death when fellow castaway Desmond repeatedly foresees Charlie's demise. In the season three finale \"Through the Looking Glass\", Charlie drowns at the hands of Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff), sacrificing himself in an effort to save the other survivors. Due to Lost's non-linear presentation of events and supernatural elements, Charlie makes several appearances in seasons four and six of the series. Charlie is prominent in the series finale, \"The End\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dominic Monaghan", "response": ["Dominic Monaghan (born 8 December 1976) is a British actor.

Unable to come up with the money herself, Shannon moves to France for a short time to work as an au pair.
