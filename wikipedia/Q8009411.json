There are many descriptions of his personal appearance at this time, all of them dwelling on his spare figure, his tight blue cloak, his witch's hat, his inevitable umbrella. He was described by the artist William Frederick Wakeman as frequently wearing \"a huge pair of green spectacles\", padded shirts to hide his malnourished figure, and a hat which \"resembled those which broomstick-riding witches are usually represented with\". In 1849, weakened by poverty, alcoholism and malnutrition, he succumbed to cholera aged only 46. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery."]}, {"page": "William Wakeman", "response": ["* William Frederick Wakeman, archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Wakeman (surname)", "response": ["*William Frederick Wakeman (1822 \u2013 1900), Irish archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Edward Henry Cooper", "response": ["In the 1876, Cooper commissioned the archaeologist William Frederick Wakeman to produce a series of drawings of the archaeology of County Sligo.

That fall, he hosted a meeting of the Association in Sligo. In 1886, when the men holding the positions of Honorary Provincial Secretary for Connaught for the Association and Editor of the Association's journal died, Wood-Martin was appointed to these positions. In January 1888, Wood-Martin became the Associations Honorary Secretary alongside William Frederick Wakeman. Wood-Martins membership in the Association was a troubled one. His Editorship only lasted for three years, and a quiet fog of scandal hangs over his departure. There were ongoing issues between Wood-Martin and the Council of the Association about the size and contents of the journal, as well as his apparent misplacing of some valuable wood blocks which belonged to the Association. He resigned as Editor in 1889, and ceased publishing in the journal. He left the organisation entirely in 1892. Afterwards, Wood-Martin began publishing in the Ulster Journal of Archaeology as a member of the Ulster Archaeological Society, which had just been founded."]}, {"page": "Brain balls", "response": ["William Frederick Wakeman also found objects he ascribed to be 'brain balls' in a tomb in Old Connacht, Bray. Wakemen submitted a sample for analysis - the ball was approximately  diameter, light yellowish, and friable, containing some harder material. The harder pieces were thought to be splinters of long bones and or vegetable charcoal on inspection under a microscope. The main body of the ball was made of amorphous cement, which gave an analysis of primarily calcium carbonate, plus calcium phosphate plus traces of iron. The analysis concluded that they were man made, but too soft to be used as weapons, and furthermore did not resemble 'brain balls' made from  lime with varying proportions of sheeps brain and or powdered bone. Wakeman came to the conclusion that these balls were coprolites."]}]}}
