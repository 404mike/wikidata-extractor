Born in Dysart, Fife, he played for Rosslyn, Raith Rovers, Southend United, Middlesbrough, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, Blackpool, Bradford Park Avenue and Manchester United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Camsell", "response": ["The Middlesbrough club record of 59 League goals in 37 games and 63 goals in all competitions in one season is held by Camsell. He accomplished this feat in the 1926\u201327 season, his first full season with Middlesbrough.  After he had initially struggled for game time and almost joined Barnsley, he made his first appearance of the season on 18 September 1926 after Jimmy McClelland had suffered an injury. Having failed to score on that day, Camsell would only fail to score on two more occasions in the following 25 matches, taking in a run of 12 successive matches in which he scored at least once. He scored five on Christmas Day, 1926 against Manchester City and two more in the return fixture on 27 December. In February 1927, Camsell broke the record for league goals in a season by a player, having overtaken Jimmy Cookson's haul of 44 (for Chesterfield in 1925\u201326). 59 remains the second-highest number of league goals scored and the equal highest number in all competitions in one English league season, behind Dixie Dean's 60 league and 100 total a year later. The nine hat-tricks Camsell scored that season remains an English record for most in a League season."]}, {"page": "James McClelland", "response": ["* Jimmy McClelland (1903\u20131976), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "West Lancashire derby", "response": ["*Jimmy McClelland: Preston North End (1929\u20131930), Blackpool (1930\u20131933)"]}, {"page": "James McClelland (footballer)", "response": ["#redirectJimmy McClelland"]}]}}
