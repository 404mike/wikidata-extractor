Theological arguments which contended that the continued existence of the soul was not taught in the Bible were made by mortalists such as Francis Blackburne, Joseph Priestley, and Samuel Bourne.  Mortalists such as Richard Overton advanced a combination of theological and philosophical arguments in favor of mortalism. Thomas Hobbes likewise made extensive use of theological argumentation. Some mortalists viewed their beliefs as a return to original Christian teaching. Mortalist theological arguments were also used to contest the Catholic doctrine of purgatory and masses for the dead."]}, {"page": "The Park Estate", "response": ["|Originally named Brightlands Built for Samuel Bourne."]}, {"page": "Indian Rebellion of 1857", "response": ["File:Outside of well, Cawnpore.jpg|The Bibighar Well site where a memorial had been built.
