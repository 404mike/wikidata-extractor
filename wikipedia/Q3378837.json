On 21 October 1950 he married Leonora May Comrie, but the marriage was annulled in 1958 and she went on to marry Rodney Kay-Kreizman.Jordan was a full-time organiser in the Communist Party of Great Britain in Nottingham, but he left the party with Ken Coates after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. After a brief period working with the Socialist Review Group in 1956, they joined the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL) in 1957.  Jordan edited the RSL's paper Socialist Fight before leaving to form the International Group in 1961. From 1964 to 1968 he edited and printed a weekly duplicated magazine, The Week, at his tiny bookshop at 4 Dane Street, Nottingham. It was largely financed by his skill in retailing second-hand books and comics.\nA short-lived reunification of Jordan's International Group with the RSL in 1964 ended early in 1965, partly in protest at the RSL's support for the expulsion of members of the Socialist Labour League from the Wandsworth Labour Party. Working with Tony Southall, Charlie van Gelderen, Ken Coates and a group students from the University of Nottingham, Jordan relaunched the International Group, which became the International Marxist Group in 1968.\nIn the 1970s Jordan worked full-time for the International Marxist Group as its national secretary and then for the Fourth International, when he helped in the work of the Africa Commission.\nIn 1985 he was struck by a chronically disabling stroke and removed from active political involvement. He died in August 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "International Group", "response": ["*In 1961, a small group in Nottingham split from the Revolutionary Socialist League to form the International Group.http://www.revolutionaryhistory.co.uk/eurooean-index/british-documents/ken-tarbuck/427-12.html From 1964 to 1968 it published a newspaper called The Week aimed at the left of the Labour Party.

Its founders, Pat Jordan and Ken Coates, had broken with the CPGB in Nottingham in 1956. They were members of the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL) in the late 1950s (which was later renamed Militant), Jordan becoming organising secretary. In 1961, they split to form the Internationalist Group in support of the IS against the leadership of the RSL, its British section.", "The IMG's activists published International, which was launched in May 1968 with IMG secretary Pat Jordan as editor and incorporated The Week. It was published with varying formats and frequencies throughout the organisation's life. Socialist Woman magazine was published from 1969 to 1980.", "Because Red Mole was used by the IMG as its main organ, articles were sometimes mistakenly thought to indicate the positions of the IMG. For example, there was confusion after Robin Blackburn had written an April 1970 article entitled \"Let it bleed\" for Red Mole, in which he argued that Marxists should disrupt the campaigns of the Labour and Conservative parties in the 1970 General Election. IMG secretary Pat Jordan replied a month later to explain why the IMG favoured a Labour victory. The group's general orientation at that time was summarised by Ali's book The Coming British Revolution ().", "By September 1970, Red Circles had been set up to organise activists who supported the paper. Many went on to join the IMG. The IMG radicalised as it grew: Pat Jordan's leadership gave way to that of John Ross, who anticipated that the rising tide of class struggle could lead to a pre-revolutionary crisis in Britain. In August 1972, the IMG formally assumed control of the Red Mole and prepared to relaunch it as a weekly newspaper.", "During the 1970s the organisation developed a number of fluid, competing factions and tendencies. The IMG's leadership included Alan Jones (John Ross), Brian Grogan, Bob Pennington, Brian Heron and others. A notable minority tendency included Pat Jordan, Tariq Ali, Phil Hearse and many of the IMG's supporters on the New Left Review editorial board. A smaller tendency supported the positions of the American Socialist Workers Party. Other tendencies included a small group that eventually left to join the Workers' Socialist League of Alan Thornett, and a Left Opposition Tendency, some of whose members left and formed a new group, the Revolutionary Marxist Current, which later joined Big Flame. The United Secretariat prepared theses on the situation in Britain and the tasks of the IMG in 1973, and again in 1976, to help orient the organisation. In 1974, its members started to publish South Asia Marxist Review."]}, {"page": "Communist Party of Great Britain", "response": ["* Pat Jordan"]}, {"page": "The Week (1964)", "response": ["The Week was a socialist magazine founded by Ken Coates and Pat Jordan in January 1964. The magazine was edited by Jordan as the journal of the International Group and aimed at a readership in the left wing of the Labour Party. Coates and Jordan were Marxist members of the Labour Party connected to the New Left Review, to which Marxist journalist Claud Cockburn occasionally contributed. Their version of The Week, named after the earlier The Week that had been edited by Cockburn, provided a socialist critique of Harold Wilson's government, notably over its failure to oppose the Vietnam War. Jordan edited the paper until 1968, when he cooperated with Tariq Ali in launching The Black Dwarf.
