By 1818 he showed \"the highest judicial excellence\", although he was criticised for snapping at boring barristers and for taking the government's side in prosecutions.Campbell (2006) p. 268. That year, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Ellenborough had a stroke, forcing his retirement. Most of the other judges and legal figures were inappropriate for the role; Sir Samuel Shepherd, for example, was while an able lawyer too deaf to sit as a judge. As a result, Abbott was appointed, and formally took up his position on 4 November 1818.Foss (2000) p. 2. As Lord Chief Justice he saw the Court of King's Bench flourish, with competent Justices and his own abilities; \"[Abbott] had more knowledge of mankind than any of [the Justices], and was more skilful as a moderator in forensic disputation\".Campbell (2006) p. 272. Abbott's central weakness as a judge was seen to be his support of James Scarlett, his leader when Abbott was a barrister; \"The timid junior, become Chief Justice, still looked up to his old leader with dread, was afraid of offending him, and was always delighted when he could decide in his favour\".Campbell (2006) p. 274."]}, {"page": "Bloomsbury Square", "response": ["* No. 38 Samuel Shepherd "]}, {"page": "Solicitor General for England and Wales", "response": ["*Sir Samuel Shepherd 1813\u20131817"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1714\u20131820)", "response": ["*Sir Samuel Shepherd (1760\u20131840)"]}, {"page": "Francis Burdett", "response": ["The House voted this action a breach of privilege, and the speaker issued a warrant for Burdett's arrest.

Burdett's colleague Thomas Cochrane offered assistance, but, realizing that Cochrane intended to use military tactics during this civil and political affair, Burdett declined. At length the house was entered, and under an escort of soldiers he was conveyed to the Tower of London. Released when parliament was in recess, he caused his supporters much disappointment by returning to Westminster by water, and so avoiding a demonstration in his honour. He then brought legal actions against the speaker and the sergeant-at-arms, but the courts upheld the action of the House.
