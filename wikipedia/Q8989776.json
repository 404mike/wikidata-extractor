A forward, he scored 119 goals in 216 league games during nine seasons of peacetime football in the Football League.\nHe began his professional career at Huddersfield Town in 1932, helping the club to a second-place finish in the First Division in 1933\u201334, before he was signed by Newcastle United three years later. After scoring 73 goals in 112 Second Division games, he was sold on to Manchester United for \u00a36,500 in February 1938. He helped the Red Devils to win promotion in 1937\u201338, but then the outbreak of war in Europe robbed him of seven full seasons of First Division football. After the war he played for Blackburn Rovers. In May 1947, he transferred to Port Vale, before moving on to non-league Congleton Town in 1948 and Macclesfield Town in 1949, whom he managed from 1951 to 1955.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Smith", "response": ["Jack Smith may refer to:", "*Jack Smith (Port Vale), footballer in 1892\u20131895", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1882) (1882 \u2013 after 1911), English player with Wolverhampton Wanderers and others", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1895) (1895\u20131946), Scottish player with Bolton Wanderers", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u20131977), English international footballer", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1901), English footballer for Bradford City and Blackburn Rovers", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1910) (1910\u20131986), English player with Sheffield United", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1911) (1911\u20131975), Welsh player with Wolves; manager of West Bromwich Albion and Reading", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20131975), English player with Manchester United", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1936) (1936\u20132008), English player with Swindon Town", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1983), English player ", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 1994), Scottish player", "*Jack Smith (footballer, born 2001), English player", "*Jack Smith (Australian footballer, born 1881) (1881\u20131927), Australian rules footballer for North Melbourne and Melbourne", "*Jack Smith (Australian footballer, born 1909) (1909\u20131983), Australian rules footballer for St Kilda and North Melbourne", "*Jack Smith (end) (1917\u20132015), American football end", "*Jack Smith (defensive back) (born 1947), American football player", "*Jack Smith (American racing driver, born 1924) (1924\u20132001), American NASCAR driver", "*Jack Smith (American racing driver, born 1973) (born 1973), American NASCAR driver", "*Jack Smith (Australian racing driver) (born 1999), Australian racing driver", "*Jack Smith (sportsman) (1936\u20132020), English cricketer and rugby union player", "*Jack Smith (Australian cricketer) (born 1977), Australian cricketer", "*Jack Smith (outfielder) (1895\u20131972), Major League Baseball player", "*Jack Smith (pitcher) (1935\u20132021), Major League Baseball player", "*Jack Smith (third baseman) (1893\u20131962), Major League Baseball player", "*Jack Smith (coach), American college football, baseball and basketball coach for Hofstra", "*Jack Smith (speedway rider) (born 1998), British speedway rider", "*Jack Smith (wheelchair rugby) (born 1991), British Paralympian", "*Whispering Jack Smith (1896\u20131950), American musician", "*Smilin' Jack Smith (1913\u20132006), American crooner, radio/television host and actor", "*Jack Smith (columnist) (1916\u20131996), Los Angeles journalist", "*John O'Neill (musician) (1926\u20131999), English musician credited as Whistling Jack Smith", "*Jack Smith (film director) (1932\u20131989), American underground film director", "*Jack Smith (politician) (1901\u20131967), Liberal party member of the Canadian House of Commons", "*Jack Smith (artist) (1928\u20132011), British abstract artist", "*Jack Smith (Pentagon), medical doctor; served as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Clinical and Program Policy", "*Jack Smith (Hotmail), co-founder of Hotmail", "*Jack Smith (American Dad!), character in U.S. animated TV series American Dad!"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|February 1938|| Jack Smith||Newcastle United||\u00a36,500"]}, {"page": "1934\u201335 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Jack Smith||||FW||6||0||0||0||6||0"]}, {"page": "1933\u201334 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["After a resurgence in form in the last few seasons, Town's form continued its upturn in form. 5 of their players, Wilf Bott, Charlie Luke, Dave Mangnall, George McLean and Jack Smith all scored more than 10 goals during the season, helping Town become the top goalscorers in the league during the season.
