He represented his country on three occasions.\nGarrett was a miner playing for Horden Colliery when Blackpool signed him as a 16-year-old in 1942, initially as a forward. It was as a full-back, however, that he established himself \u2013 and as a \"footballing\" defender, who preferred to pass his way out of trouble rather than kicking it downfield. He also spent hours practising heading the ball.Garrett made his debut for the Seasiders on 29 March 1948, in a single-goal defeat at Derby County. He did not become a regular in the side until Ron Suart left for Blackburn Rovers in 1949.\nThe 1950s are the most successful decade in Blackpool's history to date. Garrett would be at the club playing top division football throughout, as would goalkeeper George Farm, fellow defender Hugh Kelly, right winger Stanley Matthews, forward Jackie Mudie and outside left Bill Perry.\nHe could perform equally well on either flank, and played in both the 1951 and 1953 FA Cup Finals, appearing in the latter with a broken nose sustained a week beforehand. It was during this period of his career that he gained his England caps, partnering Alf Ramsey. He made his international debut against Scotland on 5 April 1952.\nAfter 14 years with Blackpool, Garrett joined Millwall on a free transfer in May 1961, making a dozen appearances for the Lions before retiring from the professional game and joining Fleetwood Town. He then played for a short time in Australia, with Mayfield United, and eventually settled there. He died on 16 April 2006 in Wallsend, New South Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blackpool F.C.", "response": ["Scottish defender Hugh Kelly had arrived at Blackpool in 1943, as had fellow defender Tommy Garrett in 1942.
