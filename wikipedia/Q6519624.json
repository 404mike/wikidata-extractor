Acting Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill sent a letter to The Times defending Robbins, highlighting that civil servants implement the decisions of elected governments. Sedwill pointed to the example of HMRC Permanent Secretary Jon Thompson receiving death threats after giving evidence to MPs about the costs of a potential post-Brexit customs plan. Responding to Sedwill's letter, Andrew Adonis said that civil servants should \"start getting used to criticism\", as they had the option to work on other policies. A group of former military and intelligence officials associated with pro-Brexit pressure group Veterans for Britain including the former head of the Secret Intelligence Service Richard Dearlove said Robbins had \"serious questions of improper conduct to answer\" over defence and security co-operation between the UK and the EU after Brexit. Former Department for Work and Pensions Permanent Secretary Leigh Lewis backed up Sedwill's letter, noting the \"occupational hazard for senior civil servants to be held responsible for the political decisions of ministers\", of which he considered the attacks on Robbins to be a blatant example in a particularly toxic environment."]}, {"page": "Leigh Warren Lewis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leigh Lewis"]}, {"page": "Sir Leigh Warren Lewis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leigh Lewis"]}, {"page": "Sir Leigh Lewis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leigh Lewis"]}]}}
