Owen Jones tweeted, \"The coverage of Michael Adebowale \u2013 one of Lee Rigby's killers \u2013 did not focus on his history of mental illness. It focused on his ideology.\" In its print edition, the Mail placed its coverage of Mair's conviction on page 30, which prompted LBC radio presenter James O'Brien to accuse the paper of double standards, saying the Mail \"has chosen to put the murder by a neo-Nazi of a serving British MP\u00a0...\u00a0on page 30. I don't really understand why. Unless a murder by a neo-Nazi is less offensive to the sensibilities of the editor of this newspaper than a murder by a radical Islamist.\" The focus the Mail gave to the conspiracy theory that Mair \"may have murdered MP Jo Cox because he feared losing his home of 40 years to an immigrant family\" led to the paper being accused by Jane Matrinson in The Guardian of normalising anti-immigrant prejudice, which she saw as a factor in Cox's murder."]}, {"page": "James O'Brien (radio presenter)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James O'Brien (broadcaster)"]}, {"page": "James O'Brien (journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James O'Brien (broadcaster)"]}, {"page": "Racism in the UK Conservative Party", "response": ["Amber Rudd was the Home Secretary following Theresa May, and served under May's premiership as Prime Minister.
