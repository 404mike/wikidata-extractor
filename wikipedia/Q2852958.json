He was associated with, though separate from, the Free Cinema movement; he said he was greatly influenced by Humphrey Jennings and by Michelangelo Antonioni\u2019s movie Il Grido (1957).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Sellers's next films, including Rodney Amateau's Where Does It Hurt? (1972) and Peter Medak's Ghost in the Noonday Sun (1974), were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons's The Optimists of Nine Elms. Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers \"a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion\". This was echoed by Sellers's biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only There's a Girl in My Soup had been a success. In his private life, he had been seeing the twenty-three-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellers's private doubts\u2014expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger\u2014about his decision to remarry."]}, {"page": "1977 in film", "response": ["| Black Joy || ITC Entertainment || Anthony Simmons (director); Jamal Ali (screenplay); Norman Beaton, Trevor Thomas, Floella Benjamin, Dawn Hope, Oscar James, Paul J.
