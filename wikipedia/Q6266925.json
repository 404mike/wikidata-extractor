He made 593 appearances in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City. He also served as manager at both clubs.\nHore appeared for Plymouth Argyle in midfield or as full back on 440 occasions. It was his task to mark Pel\u00e9 when Santos lost to Argyle 3\u20132 at Home Park in March 1973. He finished his playing career at Exeter City.\nHe was appointed manager of Argyle on 1 October 1983. However, his managerial career was short-lived, owing to his lack of success in the league, he was dismissed on 19 November 1984.\nIn his 60-game stint as manager he won 17 games, lost 27 and drew 16. The highlight, for which he is most renowned, was leading Argyle to an FA Cup semi-final. A defeat to Watford meant that Argyle did not become the first team from the Third Division to reach the final.\nHe returned to Exeter City as coach and then caretaker manager before moving into management in local non-League football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Plymouth Argyle F.C. managers", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|Danes (2009), Complete Record, p. 134.\"Johnny Hore's managerial career\".

Smith then took over at Third Division Plymouth Argyle in December 1984 from Johnny Hore and fifteenth position was achieved in his first part-season. The following year promotion was achieved to the Second Division as runners up to Reading. In 1987 Smith took Plymouth to 7th position in the second tier of English football, narrowly missing out on the end of season play-offs. This was one of the club's highest ever finishing positions and was achieved on a modest playing budget."]}]}}
