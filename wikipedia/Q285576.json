Regarded as the \"Queen of New Age\", Enya is the best-selling Irish solo artist in history. Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish-speaking area of Gweedore, County Donegal, Enya began her music career when she joined her family's Celtic folk band Clannad in 1980 on keyboards and backing vocals. She left the group in 1982 with their manager and producer Nicky Ryan to pursue a solo career, with Ryan's wife Roma Ryan as her lyricist. Enya developed her sound over the following four years with multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements of new age, Celtic, classical, church, world, pop, and Irish folk. Thus far, she has sung in ten languages, most notably English, Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge), Latin, and Welsh.", "In 1970, several members of Enya's family formed Clannad, a Celtic folk band who later acquired Nicky Ryan as their manager, sound engineer, and producer, and his future wife, Roma Ryan, as tour manager and administrator. In 1980, after her year at college, Enya decided against pursuing music at university and accepted Ryan's invitation to join the group as he wanted to expand their sound with an additional vocalist and introducing keyboards. Enya performed an uncredited role their sixth studio album, Crann \u00dall (1980), with a line-up of siblings M\u00e1ire, P\u00f3l, and Ciar\u00e1n Brennan, and twin uncles Noel and P\u00e1draig Duggan. She became an official member by the time their follow-up, Fuaim (1981), was released, and is photographed with the band on the front cover. Nicky maintained it was never his intention to make Enya a permanent member, and saw she was \"fiercely independent ... intent on playing her own music. She was just not sure of how to go about it\". This sparked discussions between the two on layering vocal tracks to create a \"choir of one\", a concept inspired by the Wall of Sound technique by producer Phil Spector that interested them both.", "In 2012, Enya returned to the studio to record her eighth album, Dark Sky Island. Its name refers to the island of Sark, which became the first island to be designated a dark-sky preserve, and a series of poems on islands by Roma Ryan.  Upon its release on 20 November 2015, Dark Sky Island went to No. 4 in the UK, Enya's highest charting studio album there since Shepherd Moons went to No. 1, and to No. 8 in the US. A Deluxe Edition features three additional songs. Enya completed a promotional tour of the UK and Europe, the US and Japan. During her visit to Japan, Enya performed \"Orinoco Flow\" and \"Echoes in Rain\" at the Universal Studios Japan Christmas show in Osaka. In December 2016, Enya appeared on the Irish television show Christmas Carols from Cork, marking her first Irish television appearance in over seven years. She sang \"Adeste Fideles\", \"Oiche Chi\u00fain\", and \"The Spirit of Christmas Past\".", "Enya's vocal range is mezzo-soprano. She has cited her musical foundations as \"the classics\", church music, and \"Irish reels and jigs\" with a particular interest in Sergei Rachmaninoff, a favourite composer of hers. She has an autographed picture of him in her home. Since 1982, she has recorded her music with Nicky Ryan as producer and arranger and his wife Roma Ryan as lyricist. While in Clannad, Enya chose to work with Nicky as the two shared an interest in vocal harmonies, and Ryan, influenced by The Beach Boys and the \"Wall of Sound\" technique that Phil Spector pioneered, wanted to explore the idea of \"the multivocals\" for which her music became known. According to Enya, \"Angeles\" from Shepherd Moons has roughly 500 vocals recorded individually and layered. Enya performs all vocals and the majority of instruments in her songs apart from musicians to play percussion, guitar, uilleann pipes, cornet, and double bass. Her early works including Watermark feature numerous keyboards, including the Yamaha KX88 Master, Yamaha DX7, Oberheim Matrix, Akai S900, Roland D-50, and Roland Juno-60, the latter a particular favourite of hers.", "| Enya, Nicky Ryan, and Roma Ryan"]}, {"page": "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring", "response": ["In 2002, the film won four Academy Awards from thirteen nominations.

Neil Buckley plays the clarinet and saxophone with Noel Bridgeman on percussion and Pat Farrell on electric guitar. Fuaim was released by Tara Music in 1982. After a further European tour, their managers Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan left the group. Nicky had brought Enya into the group to expand their sound, yet the group soon settled into their \"boring\" musical formula once more and called a meeting during the tour. After a group vote, the Ryans split. Enya followed suit, feeling increasingly restricted in a band setting and pursued a solo career with the Ryans as collaborators, causing a rift between the two groups for a short time."]}, {"page": "Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media", "response": ["| Enya, Nicky Ryan & Roma Ryan"]}, {"page": "13th Golden Raspberry Awards", "response": ["|\"Book of Days\" from Far and Away, music by Enya, lyrics by Roma Ryan"]}, {"page": "74th Academy Awards", "response": ["** \"May It Be\" from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\u00a0\u2013 Music and Lyrics by Enya, Nicky Ryan, and Roma Ryan"]}, {"page": "A Day Without Rain", "response": ["A Day Without Rain is the fifth studio album by the Irish singer, songwriter and musician Enya, released on 20 November 2000 by WEA.

Her contract allowed her considerable artistic and creative freedom, with minimal interference from the label and no deadlines to have albums finished. Enya recorded Watermark in ten months with her longtime collaborators, manager, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. It was initially recorded in Ireland in demo form before production relocated to London to re-record, mix, and master it digitally. Watermark features music in different styles, displaying Enya's sound of multi-tracked vocals with keyboards, percussion instruments, and elements of Celtic, ambient, and New-age music, though Enya believes her music does not belong in the latter genre.", "In March 1987, the 26-year-old Enya released her self-titled debut solo album Enya on BBC Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States. It was originally produced as the soundtrack to the BBC2 documentary series The Celts, with Enya and her recording partners of five years, manager, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. It was a mild commercial success, peaking at number 69 in the United Kingdom. Soon after its release Rob Dickins, then chairman of Warner Music UK, became a fan of the album, playing it \"every night before I went to bed\". Weeks later, he met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the year's Irish Recorded Music Association Awards in Dublin where Dickens learned Enya was considering signing with a rival label, prompting him to attract her to Warner. After a period of negotiations, Dickins signed Enya, granting her wish for complete artistic freedom without interference from management or deadlines to have albums finished. Dickins later said, \"Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music. This was clearly the latter ... I just wanted to be involved with this music.\" In the process, Enya departed from Atlantic and signed to the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle distribution in North America."]}, {"page": "Shepherd Moons", "response": ["Shepherd Moons is the third studio album by Irish singer, songwriter and musician Enya, released on 4 November 1991 by WEA.

The album was recorded in Ireland and London and continued to display Enya's sound of multi-tracked vocals with keyboards and elements of Celtic and new-age music.", "In September 1988, Enya released her second studio album Watermark. It became an unexpected commercial success, charting around the world helped by its international top-ten hit, \"Orinoco Flow\". The album propelled Enya to worldwide fame and she spent much of the following year travelling worldwide to promote it through interviews, appearances, and performances. With such a length of time for promotion, Enya felt the priority was to return to the studio and record a new album rather than spend further time planning and completing a concert tour, partly due to the various difficulties involved in recreating her studio-oriented sound in a live setting. Enya worked with her long time recording partners, manager, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. The success of Watermark complicated the writing process at first. Enya recalled: \"I put a lot of pressure on myself at the beginning ... When I was composing new melodies I kept thinking \"Would this have gone on Watermark? Is it as good?\" Eventually I had to forget about this and start on a blank canvas and just really go with what felt right in the studio.\"", "Enya noticed a change in her own attitude when it came to recording Shepherd Moons, \"the difference ... is that I've mellowed\". This was down to the greater amount of time Enya took away from the studio, particularly during \"quite difficult\" moments, while recording the album in comparison to Watermark. The process, she felt, improved her sense of creativity in the long run. In some parts on the album, Enya recorded 500 layered voices without sampling or replication. When the melody to a song was completed, Roma Ryan would write lyrics to it. Several months after recording and mixing was complete, Enya had not yet listened to the album. \"I will find any excuse not to. And honestly, I have never felt so miserable as finishing this album. It's fear \u2013 fear that all your feelings and all your emotions have gone into the thing, and when you hear it, it won't live up to your expectations for it.\"", "\"Caribbean Blue\" is a waltz that depicts a journey through a fantasy world. It was named by Roma Ryan, as the melody that Enya had come up with reminded her of the Caribbean. In writing about the song in 2002, Roma wrote: \"As with all dreams we reach for the ideal and \"Caribbean Blue\" represents such a dream. The lyrics can be summed up in three words, Believe in yourself.\"", "All music composed by Enya, except \"How Can I Keep from Singing?\" and \"Marble Halls\" trad. arranged by Enya and Nicky Ryan.
