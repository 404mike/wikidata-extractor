He was an orthodox slow left-arm bowler, and a lower-order right-handed batsman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johnny Wardle", "response": ["Wardle, whose family were miners, took to cricket during the Second World War and was so successful as a spin bowler and hard-hitting batsman that Yorkshire engaged him when looking for a successor to Hedley Verity, who had been killed in the war. Wardle only played one match in 1946, when the 43-year-old Arthur Booth's economy rate saw him head the averages, but when Booth fell ill with arthritis, Wardle took his place. In spite of a dry summer in 1947, Wardle was chosen for a largely experimental, Gubby Allen-led, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of the West Indies. He was disappointing on that tour, but his skill developed in the wet summer of the following year. Though an injury wiped out a quarter of his 1949 season, Wardle was deadly on the few rain-affected pitches that summer, and his bowling helped Yorkshire to make a late, albeit unsuccessful, tilt at the County Championship title."]}, {"page": "1946 English cricket season", "response": ["|| Arthur Booth ||align=\"right\"| 5504 ||align=\"right\"| 423 ||align=\"right\"| 1289 ||align=\"right\"| 111 || 11.61"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper Don Brennan, batsmen Willie Watson and Gerald Smithson, fast bowler Alec Coxon and left arm spinner Johnny Wardle. In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches. Other players included Harry Crick, Harry Halliday, Freddie Jakeman, Geoffrey Keighley and pace bowler John Whitehead.Playfair, pp. 95\u201397."]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1928\u20131932)", "response": ["It was a great season for Yorkshire also as they finally won the County Championship for the first time since 1925.Webber, p.68.  Although Wilfred Rhodes had retired, the Yorkshire team, captained by another short-term amateur appointee in Frank Greenwood, still featured Emmott Robinson and had Holmes, Sutcliffe, Leyland, Oldroyd and Mitchell at the top of the batting order, Arthur Wood keeping wicket and match-winning bowlers in Macaulay, Bowes and Verity.  Wilf Barber was the main reserve and an interesting debutant was Arthur Booth, 15 seasons before he was finally able to make his mark as another match-winning bowler."]}, {"page": "Arthur Booth", "response": ["Arthur Booth may refer to:", "* Arthur Booth (cricketer, born 1902), English cricketer", "* Arthur Booth (cricketer, born 1926), English cricketer", "* Arthur Booth (cartoonist), Irish cartoonist", "* Arthur Booth-Clibborn, Salvation Army officer"]}, {"page": "1946 County Championship", "response": ["Captained by Brian Sellers, Yorkshire's success was chiefly due to its two main bowlers Ellis Robinson and Arthur Booth who took 167 and 111 wickets respectively in all first-class matches.  Yorkshire's pace bowlers were the veteran Bill Bowes, who played for England in 1946, and future England player Alec Coxon.  They took 65 and 69 wickets respectively.  Seamer Frank Smailes, who also played for England against India, took 76 wickets.  Booth was the season's surprise success as he was then 43 and had been a Minor Counties player before the war.  Yorkshire had recalled him after many years absence as a replacement for the late Hedley Verity and Booth made the most of frequently damp conditions that suited his type of slow left arm bowling.  Yorkshire's batting depended heavily on Len Hutton, supported by veterans Wilf Barber and Maurice Leyland.  Norman Yardley batted well and took part in a Test trial."]}]}}
