His family moved to Belfast in 1920, where after attending the Royal Academical Institution he entered Queen's University in 1935. Following his graduation, Jim continued to work at Queen's, and was the first fellow to be enrolled in the School of Theoretical Physics at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Sciences.\nAfter service with the British Admiralty during the Second World War, Jim resumed his physics research at the University of Manchester (1945-1949), under Patrick Blackett, where he worked on radiation damping and associated topics.\nAt the University of Cambridge, where he lectured in mathematics (1950\u20131960), he was at the forefront of work on S-matrix theory and became known for his sophisticated use of dispersion relations. His work there included collaborations with Abdus Salam and Hans Bethe. During his last two years he was at the core, along with Richard Eden and George Batchelor, of founding the new Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics.\nAt University College, London (1960-1964) he formed a thriving high energy physics research group, before moving to Copenhagen and NORDITA, where he led the teaching of particle physics in Scandinavia from 1964 to 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of theoretical physicists", "response": ["* James Hamilton (1918\u20132000)"]}, {"page": "James Hamilton", "response": ["James Hamilton may refer to:", "*James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton (1606\u20131649), heir to the throne of Scotland", "*James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton (1658\u20131712), Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Hamilton (1703\u20131743), Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton (1724\u20131758), Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton (1755\u20131769), Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn (1811\u20131885), twice served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland", "*James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn (1838\u20131913), British nobleman and diplomat", "*James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn (1869\u20131953), first Governor of Northern Ireland", "*James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Abercorn (1904\u20131979), Northern Irish senator", "*James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Abercorn (born 1934), Northern Irish politician", "*James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton (1589\u20131625), 4th Earl of Arran, Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran (c. 1475\u20131529), Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault (c. 1516\u20131575), and 2nd Earl of Arran, Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran (c. 1537\u20131609), Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Abercorn (c. 1575\u20131618), Sheriff of Linlithgow", "*James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Abercorn (c. 1604\u2013c. 1670), Scottish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 6th Earl of Abercorn (c. 1661\u20131734), Scottish and Irish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 7th Earl of Abercorn (1686\u20131744), Scottish nobleman and amateur scientist", "*James Hamilton, 8th Earl of Abercorn (1712\u20131789), Scottish and Irish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil (first creation) (died 1659), Anglo-Irish Royalist peer, soldier and politician", "*James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil (second creation) (1694\u20131758), British politician", "*James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil (1730\u20131798), Irish peer", "*James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Claneboye (1560\u20131644), Ulster Scot land owner and settler", "*James Hamilton, Viscount Hamilton (1786\u20131814), British politician", "*Sir James Hamilton of Cadzow (before 1397\u2013c. 1440), 5th Laird of Cadzow", "*James Hamilton, 1st Lord Hamilton (1415\u20131479), Scottish nobleman", "*Sir James Hamilton of Finnart (died 1540), military engineer, illegitimate son of the 1st earl and guardian to the 2nd", "*James Hamilton, 3rd Baron Hamilton of Strabane (1633\u20131655), Irish nobleman", "*James Hamilton, Lord Paisley (died before 1670), eldest son of James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Abercorn", "*James Hamilton, 4th Baron Hamilton of Dalzell (1938\u20132006), British politician", "* James Hamilton (painter) (1819\u20131878), American painter;
