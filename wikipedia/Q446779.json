It is available in the U.S. under the trade names Antilirium and  Isopto Eserine, and as eserine salicylate and eserine sulfate. Today, physostigmine is most commonly used for its medicinal value. However, before its discovery by Sir Robert Christison in 1846, it was much more prevalent as an ordeal poison. The positive medical applications of the drug were first suggested in the gold medal-winning final thesis of Thomas Richard Fraser at the University of Edinburgh in 1862.", "In 1846, European missionaries arrived in what was referred to as Old Calabar, now part of Nigeria. These missionaries wrote about the use of the Calabar bean as a test for witchcraft. These beans eventually made their way back to Scotland, the home of these particular missionaries, where in 1855 Robert Christison, a toxicologist, tested the toxicity of the poison on himself by eating one. He survived to document the experience. The bean was studied throughout the 1860s by a few different Edinburgh scientists, including Douglas Argyll Robertson who wrote a paper on the use of Calabar bean extract on the eye and was the first to use it medicinally, and Thomas Richard Fraser, who researched how to best extract the active principle, which was later determined to be physostigmine. Fraser also studied the antagonism between physostigmine and atropine extremely rigorously, at a time when the concept of antagonism had little if any experimental support. Fraser's research is still the basis of today's knowledge about the interactions between atropine and physostigmine at many different and specific doses. Physostigmine's first use as a treatment for glaucoma was by Ludwig Laqueur in 1876. Laqueur himself suffered from glaucoma so, like Christison, he experimented on himself, although Laqueur was much more scientific and methodical in his self-treatment."]}, {"page": "Keith Medal", "response": ["*1891\u201393: Sir Thomas Richard Fraser, for his papers on Strophanthus hispidus, Strophanthin, and Strophanthidin"]}, {"page": "Ammoniacum", "response": ["Ammoniacum is closely related to asafoetida and galbanum (from which, however, it differs in yielding no umbelliferone) both in regard to the plant which yields it and its putative therapeutical effects. Internally it is used in conjunction with squills in bronchial affections.  In asthma and chronic colds it is found useful, but it has no advantages over a number of other substances of more constant and active properties (Sir Thomas Richard Fraser). Only the \"tear ammoniacum\" is official."]}, {"page": "Physostigma venenosum", "response": ["The main antidote to Calabar bean poisoning is the slightly less toxic tropane alkaloid atropine, which may often succeed; and the other measures are those usually employed to stimulate the circulation and respiration. Unfortunately, the antagonism between physostigmine and atropine is not perfect, and Sir Thomas Richard Fraser demonstrated that, in such cases, there comes a time when, if the action of the two drugs is summated, death results sooner than from either alone. Thus atropine will save life if three and a half times the fatal dose of physostigmine has been taken, but will hasten the end if four or more times the fatal dose has been ingested.", "The people of Old Calabar used Calabar beans or 'E-ser-e' as an ordeal poison, and administered them to persons accused of witchcraft or other crimes. It was considered to affect only the guilty; if a person accused of a crime ingested the beans without dying, they were considered innocent. A form of dueling with the seeds was also practiced, in which the two opponents divide a bean, each eating one half; that quantity has been known to kill both adversaries. Although thus highly poisonous, the bean has nothing in external aspect, taste or smell to distinguish it from any harmless leguminous seed, and disastrous effects have resulted from its being incautiously left in the way of children. The beans were first introduced into Britain in the year 1840; but the plant was not accurately described until 1861, and its physiological effects were investigated in 1863 by Sir Thomas Richard Fraser. The bean usually contains a little more than 1% of alkaloids. Two of these have been identified, one called calabarine with atropine-like effects, and the other, the drug physostigmine (with the opposite effect), used in the treatment of anticholinergic syndrome, myasthenia gravis, glaucoma and delayed gastric emptying."]}, {"page": "Thomas Fraser", "response": ["*Thomas Richard Fraser (1841\u20131920), British physician and pharmacologist"]}, {"page": "James Bell Pettigrew", "response": ["In 1869 he returned to Scotland to take up an honorary position as Curator of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and employment as pathologist to the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.

As a result of this experiment he recommended that an extract, which contained the active ingredient, the alkaloid physostigmine, be used to reverse the action of atropine, which had been used in fundoscopy to dilate the pupil since Helmholtz's introduction of the ophthalmoscope in 1851.Robertson DA.
