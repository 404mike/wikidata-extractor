The founders were members of the Scottish community in S\u00e3o Paulo, included among them Archie McLean. Scottish Wanderers debuted in the Campeonato Paulista organized by APEA on April 5, 1914, finishing in the fifth place in that season. They competed for the last time in 1915, when they finished again in the fifth place. The players who were members of Mackenzie College shared the club's income, which was understood by the Campeonato Paulista organizers as playing professionally. A player who was not allowed to play in the club denounced this fact to the APEA and thus the club were banned in 1916, as only amateur clubs were allowed to compete in the tournament at that time. The club folded a few days after being banned."]}]}}
