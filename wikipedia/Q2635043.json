The death in April 1956, however, of British agent Lionel Crabb while examining Soviet ships in Portsmouth harbor embarrassed the British government, which asked the United States to postpone the Lakenheath flights. To avoid delays, in June 1956, Detachment A moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, without approval from the German government, while Giebelstadt Army Airfield was prepared as a more permanent base.Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 93\u201395."]}, {"page": "1956", "response": ["** British diver Lionel Crabb (working for MI6) dives into Portsmouth Harbour, to investigate a visiting Soviet cruiser, and vanishes."]}, {"page": "The Red Sea Sharks", "response": ["frogman, whose depiction was drawn from a press clipping of Lionel Crabb.
