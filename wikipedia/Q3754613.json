He gained a good reputation in this profession, even if considered a less careful dealer and a more solitary businessman than his father. Through his work at Christie's, he \"consolidated its dominance of the London fine art auctioneering scene\", continuing his father's work there. He oversaw several notable sales at the auction house, and passed the business along to his son, ultimately ensuring it remained in the family until 1889.\nAside from his work as a businessman, Christie was an amateur classical scholar. He produced works on the Greek origins of Chess, Etruscan vase painting, elemental themes in Paganism, and Ancient Greek sculpture, for which he received generally favourable reviews. He befriended several notable contemporary scholars, such as Sir John Soane and Charles Townley, who encouraged his studies and provided him with rare antiquities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christie's", "response": ["Christie's is a British auction house founded in 1766 by James Christie.
