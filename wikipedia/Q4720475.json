He is most known for his photographic \"skull portraits\" and also his meteorite and Life Burger sculptures. Set within the tradition of Vanitas, these works are designed as aids to spiritual and philosophical contemplation. He has referred to his art work as \"a way to give experience meaning in a tangible form; it is an exploration into the mysteries and sacredness of life and its presentation through art\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Lynch", "response": ["In a 2019 interview of Lynch by British artist Alexander de Cadenet, Lynch said of TM, \"Here's an experience that utilizes the full brain.

The face is described as \"warm, young, earnest and rather serious\". On 11 February 2014 the University of Leicester announced the project to sequence the entire genome of Richard III and one of his living relatives, Michael Ibsen, whose mitochondrial DNA confirmed the identification of the excavated remains. Richard III thus became the first ancient person of known historical identity whose genome has been sequenced. In 2016 contemporary British artist Alexander de Cadenet presented a skull portrait of Richard III in conjunction with Leicester University. The portraits have been produced using University of Leicester forensic X-ray scans of the king."]}, {"page": "Vanitas", "response": ["*Alexander de Cadenet, Skull Portraits, various subjects, 1996 \u2013 present."]}, {"page": "Sleazenation", "response": ["The founding editor was Steve Beale, who left in 1999 to work at EMAP on The Face and Arena.
