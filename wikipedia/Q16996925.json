Despite Brisbane not being a major shareholder, the company's name was changed to H. L. Brisbane & Co. Ltd. Despite the Great Depression, he expanded the company until it challenged Brisbane's former employer Wunderlich as market leader. In 1938 Wunderlich merged its Western Australian operation with H. L. Brisbane on condition Brisbane wouldn't expand his business interstate. H. L. Brisbane & Wunderlich Ltd became the state's largest clay tile producer and enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the industry. Over the next 28 years Brisbane built the firm into a large and diversified manufacturing enterprise: it made stainless steel products, clay sewer-pipes, porcelain, refractory bricks, aluminium fabrication, building cladding and plastics. It sold to Australian Fine China in the 1990s."]}, {"page": "The Deputy Drummer", "response": ["* Reginald Long as Captain Hindlemarsh "]}, {"page": "Beloved Imposter", "response": ["* Reginald Long as Mr. Sladen "]}, {"page": "Trust the Navy", "response": ["* Reginald Long as Serge Chungster  "]}, {"page": "Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Tristan-Bernard", "response": ["* 1968: Le Myst\u00e8re de River Lodge by Reginald Long, directed by Daniel Crouet"]}, {"page": "Reginald Long (disambiguation)", "response": ["Reginald Long can refer to:", "* Reginald Long, British screenwriter and actor"]}, {"page": "Hot News (1936 film)", "response": ["* Reginald Long  as Prince Stephen "]}, {"page": "The Lisbon Story (musical)", "response": ["It premiered at the Imperial Theatre, Brighton before transferring to the West End where it ran for 493 performances at the London Hippodrome from 17 June 1943 to 8 July 1944.
