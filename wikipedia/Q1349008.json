The influence of the brass band tradition in euphonium writing is evident in the many euphonium solos in both brass band and concert band pieces by British composers Peter Graham, John Golland, Martin Ellerby, Philip Sparke and Gareth Wood; among contemporary American band composers, Robert W. Smith, David Maslanka, David Gillingham, Eric Whitacre, and James Curnow especially seem to enjoy using the euphonium as a solo instrument.

Since then, Neal Corwell, a euphonium performer as well as composer, has contributed many additional solos with synthesized, recorded accompaniment, beginning with Odyssey (1990).  On the other hand, British composer Philip Sparke has written numerous euphonium solos (e.g. Pantomime, Song for Ina, Harlequin) of a much lighter nature, though no less technically demanding.  Unique works such as the war protest piece One of the Missing (for those lost in Iraq - 2007) have also brought the instrument forward to be used in a more divergent and compelling way."]}, {"page": "Steven Mead", "response": ["Steven Mead (born 1962 in Bournemouth, England) is an English virtuoso euphonium soloist and teacher who has played an important role in achieving worldwide recognition of the instrument.Roy Newsome, The Modern Brass Band: From the 1930s to the New Millennium, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006, p. 252. .Peter Spaull,  \"Blowing in the wind my friends\", Liverpool Daily Post, March 28, 2003.
