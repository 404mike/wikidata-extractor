This custom was followed with a few inconsistencies from the 16th until the 19th centuries; creations became more regular from 1889 onwards. However, from 1964 onwards, the regular creation of hereditary titles such as baronetcies was phased out, so subsequent lord mayors were offered knighthoods (and, until 1993, most often as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE)). Since 1993, lord mayors have not automatically received any national honour upon appointment; instead, they have been made knights bachelor upon retirement, although Gordon Brown's Government broke with that tradition by making Ian Luder a CBE, after his term of office in 2009, and the following year Nick Anstee declined offers of an honour. Furthermore, foreign heads of state visiting the City of London on a UK State Visit, diplomatically bestow upon the Lord Mayor one of their suitable national honours. For example, in 2001, Sir David Howard was created a grand cordon (first class) of the Order of Independence of Jordan by King\u00a0Abdullah\u00a0II. Recently lord mayors have been appointed at the beginning of their term of office knights or dames of St John, as a mark of respect, by Queen Elizabeth II, Sovereign Head of the Order of St John."]}, {"page": "Worshipful Company of Coopers", "response": ["* 2008: Ian Luder"]}, {"page": "List of lord mayors of London", "response": ["| 2008 || Ian Luder || Cooper||"]}, {"page": "Court of Aldermen", "response": ["|Ian Luder CBE"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Ian Luder, Taxation specialist, and Lord Mayor of the City of London 2008\u20132009", "* Ian Luder (BA Economics and Economic History), UK tax expert and former Lord Mayor of the City of London"]}, {"page": "Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "response": ["On 28 March 2012, Ian Luder was announced as the new chair of the Trust.
