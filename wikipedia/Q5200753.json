Davison once again tried his formula of signing experienced players, with Dennis Westcott and Cyril Hatton arriving at Saltergate amongst others. He had to endure severe financial constraints with the club only being able to afford 14 full-time professionals. Despite this the team challenged for promotion, finishing sixth in Division Three North four seasons in succession. Davison's youth policy also saw fruition when the youth team reached the final of the FA Youth Cup in 1956 with future World Cup winner Gordon Banks one of the stars. He was asked to manage the Third Division North side against the South in April 1957. Davison stepped down as Chesterfield manager in May 1958, at the age of 70, however he did continue to do some scouting for the club."]}, {"page": "Central Technology and Sports College", "response": ["* Cyril Hatton, footballer for QPR (scored 64 league goals)"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On 3 October, Vale secured the biggest ever win at Vale Park when they beat York City 5\u20130. Seven days later Vale's clean sheet streak came to an end, though they still secured a 2\u20131 victory over Chesterfield at Saltergate; Cyril Hatton was the scorer for Chesterfield, though it proved not enough to save his team's unbeaten home record. Albert Mullard had a penalty kick saved towards the end of the game by goalkeeper Ron Powell, the only one of two penalties the club were awarded throughout the campaign. Vale then beat Tranmere Rovers 2\u20130 after their defence successfully contained the threat posed by the division's then-top scorer Cyril Done. The following week they won 1\u20130 at Halifax Town in a game where Ken Griffiths hit the woodwork three times."]}]}}
