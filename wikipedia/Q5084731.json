He also took part in the 1954 Scottish League Cup Final, a defeat to his former employers. His career was latterly interrupted by injuries. His uncle John Blair was also a footballer, and also won silverware with Motherwell.Cox never played international football, but some reference books list him as having played once for Scotland in a 3\u20130 defeat by France in 1948 \u2013 the player who did take part at short notice, the right back Sammy Cox, was a distant relative.
