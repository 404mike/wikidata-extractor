Brand cites his practice of transcendental meditation as a significant factor in his recovery from drug dependence. Brand organised three fundraisers for Focus 12 in London, Dublin and Belfast in 2009, and has also acted as a \"sponsor\" for numerous people during the rehabilitation stage of their treatment process."]}, {"page": "John Noel", "response": ["John Noel may refer to:", "*John Noel (1659\u20131718), Member of Parliament for Rutland", "*John Noel (1702\u20131728), Member of Parliament for Rutland", "*John Noel (sport shooter) (1888\u20131939), American sport shooter", "*John Noel (producer) (born 1952), British television producer and theatrical agent", "*John Noel, Oil and Gas Campaigns Coordinator for Clean Water Action"]}, {"page": "The Morgana Show", "response": ["The show received mixed reviews. The majority, while generally praising Robinson's performance and comic timing, criticised the sketches and writing. The British Comedy Guide wrote that \"Morgana Robinson is clearly an acting talent to watch, as she demonstrates a very wide range of characters in this show ... however, that all said, this is not going to be the TV vehicle that makes Morgana famous - most of the sketches just simply aren't funny enough.\" Paul Whitelaw, writing in The Scotsman, said: \"We must part with our celebration of female-fronted comedy, thanks to The Morgana Show, a witless sketch vehicle for newcomer Morgana Robinson. Why has she got her own show? Is it because her agent is the powerful John Noel, who numbers Russell Brand among his clients? I wonder.\" John Crace of The Guardian wrote: \"At her best, Robinson is one of the sharpest and funniest comics around: unfortunately, this show didn't do her any favours.\" Fiona Sturges of The Independent described the show as \"teeth-grindingly, bewilderingly awful.\""]}, {"page": "Brand: A Second Coming", "response": ["Timoner spent two and a half years on the project.
