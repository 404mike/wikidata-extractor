The Kurdologist and Iranologist Garnik Asatrian stated that \"The Central Iranian dialects, and primarily those of the Kashan area in the first place, as well as the Azari dialects (otherwise called Southern Tati) are probably the only Iranian dialects, which can pretend to be the direct offshoots of Median...

His research at the SOAS focused on the oral traditions of the Iranian languages and to organize such studies, he founded the Society for Iranian Oral Studies (SIOS). From 1990 his interest turned towards the Yazidi traditions and in 1992 he undertook a journey to Iraqi Kurdistan to establish relationships with Yazidi dignitaries. In 1996 he became the Professor on Iranian studies at the University of G\u00f6ttingen where he succeeded David Neil MacKenzie. He went to G\u00f6ttingen due to his interest in Yazidi culture and the fact that at the time about half of the Yazidi diaspora lived in Germany. He retired from G\u00f6ttingen in 2016. According to his own account given in his farewell interview from the university, he has seriously studied 34 languages. He has published numerous books on oriental languages and culture and has also written for the Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica."]}]}}
