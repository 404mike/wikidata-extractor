He was appointed as the Labour Party's Executive Director of Strategy and Communications in October 2015 under Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, initially on leave from The Guardian. In January 2017, he left The Guardian in order to work for the party full-time. He later left his role upon Corbyn's departure as Leader in April 2020.Milne joined The Guardian in 1984. He was a columnist and associate editor there at the time of his Labour Party appointment, and according to Peter Popham writing for The Independent in 1997, was \"on the far left of the Labour Party.\" Milne is the author of The Enemy Within: The Secret War Against the Miners, a book about the 1984\u201385 British miners' strike which focuses on the role of MI5 and Special Branch in the dispute.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marxism\u2013Leninism", "response": ["Some academics, such as St\u00e9phane Courtois (The Black Book of Communism), Steven Rosefielde (Red Holocaust), and Rudolph Rummel (Death by Government), wrote of mass, excess deaths under Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes. These authors defined the political repression by communists as a \"Communist democide\", \"Communist genocide\", \"Red Holocaust\", or followed the \"victims of Communism\" narrative. Some of them compared Communism to Nazism and described deaths under Marxist\u2013Leninist regimes (civil wars, deportations, famines, repressions, and wars) as being a direct consequence of Marxism\u2013Leninism. Some of these works, in particular The Black Book of Communism and its 93 or 100 millions figure, are cited by political groups and Members of the European Parliament. Without denying the tragedy of the events, other scholars criticise the interpretation that sees communism as the main culprit as presenting a biased or exaggerated anti-communist narrative. Some academics propose a more nuanced analysis of Marxist\u2013Leninist rule, stating that anti-communist narratives have exaggerated the extent of political repression and censorship in Marxist\u2013Leninist states and drawn comparisons with what they see as atrocities that were perpetrated by capitalist countries, particularly during the Cold War. These academics include Mark Aarons, Noam Chomsky, Jodi Dean, Kristen Ghodsee, Seumas Milne, and Michael Parenti. Ghodsee, Nathan J. Robinson, and Scott Sehon wrote about the merits of taking an anti anti-communist position that does not deny the atrocities but make a distinction between anti-authoritarian communist and other socialist currents, both of which have been victims of repression.", "Writing for The Guardian, Seumas Milne stated the result of the post\u2013Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, therefore communism is as monstrous as Nazism, \"has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure.\" Other leftists, including some Marxist\u2013Leninists, apply self-criticism, and have at times criticised Marxist\u2013Leninist praxis and some actions by Marxist\u2013Leninist governments, while acknowledging its advancements, emancipatory acts such as their support of labour rights, women's rights, anti-imperialism, democratic efforts, egalitarian achievements, modernisation, and the creation of mass social programs for education, health, housing, and jobs as well as the increase of living standards. According to Parenti, these revolutionary governments \"extended a number of popular freedoms without destroying those freedoms that never existed in the previous regimes\", such as democracy and individual rights, citing the examples of the \"feudal regime\" of Chiang Kai-shek in China, the \"U.S.-sponsored police state\" of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, the \"U.S.-supported puppet governments\" of B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i and others in Vietnam as well as French colonialism in Algeria; nonetheless, they \"fostered conditions necessary for national self-determination, economic betterment, the preservation of health and human life, and the end of many of the worst forms of ethnic, patriarchal, and class oppression.\""]}, {"page": "Stalinism", "response": ["Writing two The Guardian articles in 2002 and 2006, British journalist Seumas Milne said that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, therefore communism is as monstrous as Nazism, \"has been to relativize the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure.\"Milne, Seumas (12 September 2002). \"The battle for history\".

Few major trade unions supported the NUM, primarily because of the absence of a vote at national level. Violent confrontations between flying pickets and police characterised the year-long strike, which ended in a decisive victory for the Conservative government and allowed the closure of most of Britain's collieries. Many observers regard the strike as \"the most bitter industrial dispute in British history\".  The number of person-days of work lost to the strike was over 26 million, making it the largest since the 1926 general strike.

In November 1984, it was alleged that senior NUM officials had travelled to Libya for money. Cash from the Libyan government was particularly damaging coming seven months after the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London by Libyan agents. In 1990, the Daily Mirror and TV programme The Cook Report claimed that Scargill and the NUM had received money from the Libyan government. The allegations were based on allegations by Roger Windsor, who was the NUM official who had spoken to Libyan officials. Roy Greenslade, the editor of the Mirror, said 18 years later he was \"now convinced that Scargill didn't misuse strike funds and that the union didn't get money from Libya.\" This was long after an investigation by Seumas Milne described the allegations as wholly without substance and a \"classic smear campaign\"."]}, {"page": "Robert Harris (novelist)", "response": ["Formerly a donor to the Labour Party, he renounced his support for the party after the appointment of Guardian journalist Seumas Milne as its communications director by leader Jeremy Corbyn.

Media Lens wrote that Johnson\u2019s change in policy, announced in January 2017, to accept that President Bashar al-Assad should be allowed to stand for election and remain in power, was the result of newly elected President Trump\u2019s opposition to Obama\u2019s war for regime change in Syria. They said Milne\u2019s comments were \"not defending Assad, merely calling for greater attention to US-UK atrocities\". They described the media reaction as \"ferocious criticism of Milne\u2019s innocuous comments and the complete absence of any criticism of Johnson\u2019s policy shift\".
