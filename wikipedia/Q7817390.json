Dicks planned to use Garland in a strike partnership with target man Paul Cheesley, but a severe injury to Cheesley meant that Garland had to play as the target man centre-forward despite his small stature. He initially struggled in the role, but Dicks had no other suitable replacements other than Tom Ritchie, who also was not a natural centre-forward. Despite a tough end-of-season schedule City managed to pick up enough to points to narrowly avoid relegation in 1976\u201377, with Garland scoring winning goals against Leeds United and Liverpool."]}, {"page": "Paul Cheesley", "response": ["In December 1973, as Norwich fought to avoid relegation, Cheesley was offloaded and snapped up by Alan Dicks at Bristol City for a fee of \u00a330,000.
