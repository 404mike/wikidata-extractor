The commodore worked together with the senior escort officer (SOE), who was in command of the warships protecting the convoy. The SOE was ultimately responsible for the safe and timely arrival of the convoy. This situation could have been a source of friction; the SOE (usually a Lt Cdr or Commander) would invariably be junior to the commodore, often a retired Flag Officer with many years experience. In practice the two worked together pragmatically; Peter Gretton, an escort commander during the Battle of the Atlantic, describes how his instructions, which were couched in the form of suggestions, were always acted upon: He recalls only one instance where he had to \"pull rank\" on the commodore.Gretton p", "* Peter Gretton (1964) Convoy Escort Commander Cassell "]}, {"page": "Convoy SC 130", "response": ["SC 130, comprising thirty-seven ships, departed Halifax Harbour on 11 May 1943 in the care of a Western Local Escort Force, led by RCN destroyer .

Mountbatten, who became the new CNS in 1957 ordered a review of the cruiser programme immediately on 4 January 1957, believing the large cruisers were of no practical use and far too big as Seaslug GMS ship.
