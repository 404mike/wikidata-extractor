Then at Lord's against Middlesex he took seven wickets for 43 runs on a pitch that Wisden called \"difficult\". By the end of July, he had taken 51 first-class wickets at an average of 21.78.

He made his debut for Somerset in May 1952 aged just 16 years and three months, the youngest cricketer ever to play for the county; he did not take a wicket in his first match but scored 18 out of a ninth wicket partnership of 48 with Bertie Buse. There were two further matches in 1953 before Harris disappeared from first-class cricket for three years on National Service. When his cricket career resumed with five matches in 1957, he made useful runs from the lower order, with a career-highest of 41 in the match against Worcestershire. But he still struggled for wickets in a Somerset side that, unlike the year of the debut, 1952, now had several options in fast and medium-paced bowling with the recruitment of Bill Alley, Ken Palmer, Bryan Lobb, Ken Biddulph and Geoff Lomax. He did not play at all in Somerset's successful season of 1958 but returned for seven games in 1959. These included his best bowling performance, three wickets for 29 runs against Worcestershire. But at the end of the season although his contract had a further year to go Harris retired due to an injury and a job offer as a coach with Framlingham College, Suffolk."]}]}}
