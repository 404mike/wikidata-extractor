In that year she travelled with Dora Montefiore of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to the International Congress of Women in Berlin, but she was not in sympathy with the main WSPU policy, which was to secure the vote for women on the same highly restricted basis that it was then given to men. This involved a property qualification, and thus largely excluded the working class. Bondfield saw no benefit in this policy to the women that she represented, and aligned herself with the Adult Suffrage Society (ASS), which campaigned for universal adult suffrage, men and women alike, regardless of property. In 1906 she became chairman of the society and supported the Franchise and Removal of Women's Disabilities bill, introduced to parliament by Sir Charles Dilke.Abrams, pp. 225\u201326 This proposed full adult suffrage, and the right of women to become MPs. The bill was \"talked out\" in the House of Commons, but Bondfield's support antagonised many militants in the WSPU, who considered the bill a distraction from their more limited aims. In 1907, in the course of a public debate with Teresa Billington-Greig of the Women's Freedom League (a breakaway group from the WSPU), Bondfield argued that the only way forward was a bill that enfranchised all men and all women, without qualification.Holton, pp. 57\u201358 She wished good luck to those fighting for a \"same terms as men\" suffrage bill, but \"don't let them come and tell me that they are working for my class\".Bondfield, p. 83 The strains of her duties and constant campaigning began to undermine her health, and in 1908 she resigned her union post after ten years' service, during which NAUSAWC membership had risen to over 20,000.Hamilton, p. 61 Her departure, she said, was \"alike a grief and a deliverance\".Bondfield, p. 60 After the passing of the Representation of the People's Act 1918, giving some women the vote, Bondfield's answer to 'Are Women MPs necessary?\" was \u2018We shall never reach a satisfactory State until we have the recognition of the citizen irrespective of sex.\u2019"]}, {"page": "HM Prison Holloway", "response": ["Before the first world war, Holloway was used to imprison those suffragettes who broke the law.

It was only when a number of suffragists, despairing of change through peaceful means, decided to turn to militant protest that the \"suffragette\" was born. These women broke the law in pursuit of their aims, and many were imprisoned at Holloway for their criminal activity. They were not treated as political prisoners, the authorities arguing they were imprisoned for their vandalism, not their opinions. In protest, some went on hunger strike and were force fed so Holloway has a large symbolic role in the history of women's rights in the UK for those in sympathy with the movement.

Baldock attended 21 December 1905  pre-election meeting of the Liberals at the Royal Albert Hall dressed as a 'maid' to Annie Kenney (who wore a fur coat) and both sat in a box and Kenney hung a banner over the edge saying 'Votes for Women' and called out, resulting in a disturbance. The next day Baldock visited Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman with Kenney and Teresa Billington to ask about when Liberals would deal with female suffrage, resulting in Dora Montefiore congratulating Baldock's 'noble stand' in a postcard.  Baldock became a paid employee of the WSPU and a mentor to Daisy Parsons, and had a postal order for 30shillings from Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence to cover the costs of attending meetings in Long Eaton, Derbyshire.

A woman fellow-worker writes of her: \u201cShe recognised clearly and fully that every worthy motive for right living remained the same, whether life lived \u2018for evermore,\u2019 or ceased with the parting breath; and the less she concerned herself for a personal immortality the more she strove for the well-being and the moral progress of the race. \u2018Progress,\u2019 writes a modern author, consists in human souls, taught to know their dignity, and the vast Universe of their inheritance.'Zona Vallance\u2019s significant contributions to the Ethical Movement were acknowledged in Stanton Coit\u2019s Ethical Church with a plaque designed by Ernestine Mills, a fellow Ethical Society member and women\u2019s rights advocate. In a pamphlet describing the secular church, Coit wroteThe first memorial tablet to be placed in our Church is the one to the left of our pulpit. It is a testimonial of the high esteem in which Miss Zona Vallance was held by all her colleagues in the Suffrage and Ethical Movements. It is a splendid enamel by Mrs Ernestine Mills, representing a Joan of Arc figure bearing an ensign of purple, green and white, the colours of the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union, and memorialising Miss Vallance\u2019s enthusiastic welcome to this more aggressive organisation, concerning the latter developments of which she did not live to form a judgement.A bequest by Vallance 'for the promotion of the cause of all women's political, professional and financial equality with men' caused consternation among her executors and next of kin. In 1945, the Gloucester Citizen reported that although the National Council of Women had claimed the gift, a judge ruled that it was 'invalid for uncertainty', stating that he 'had no notion how a trust to promote the cause of equality with men or womenhood in general, wherever they might come from and whatever their race or colour, could be executed by the Court.'
