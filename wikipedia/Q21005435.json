Westminster Council had listed the premises as an asset of community value (ACV) to prevent conversion into flats, however this ACV designation did not stop the premises being used as a bogus estate agents office. Tom Stainer, head of communications for the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) commented: \"This is just the latest in a long line of pubs converted due to a loophole in planning law.\" The council received a petition from 800 people and with support from Paul Heaton of pop group The Housemartins who filmed the video for Happy Hour in The Star in 1986."]}]}}
