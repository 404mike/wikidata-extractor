The hotel was also known as Wilson's Hotel and changed its name to the Great Eastern Hotel.  It became the most famous hotel in India and is still functioning today as the Great Eastern Kolkata and is part of the Bharat Hotels Group.David Wilson came from Herefordshire and started a bakery at No. 1 Old Court House Street. The bakery was successful as it served the need of the Britishers from the East India Company who missed their breads and muffins in India. He subsequently bought the No. 2 and then No. 3 in Old Court House Road in 1840 to convert it into a hotel, which he had named after George Eden, the first Earl of Auckland.", "link_mentions": {}}}
