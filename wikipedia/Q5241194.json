The hotel was also known as Wilson's Hotel and changed its name to the Great Eastern Hotel.  It became the most famous hotel in India and is still functioning today as the Great Eastern Kolkata and is part of the Bharat Hotels Group.David Wilson came from Herefordshire and started a bakery at No. 1 Old Court House Street. The bakery was successful as it served the need of the Britishers from the East India Company who missed their breads and muffins in India. He subsequently bought the No. 2 and then No. 3 in Old Court House Road in 1840 to convert it into a hotel, which he had named after George Eden, the first Earl of Auckland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Wilson", "response": ["* David Wilson (artist) (1873\u20131935), Irish illustrator and painter", "* David Wilson (violinist) (born 1945), American violinist", "* David Wilson (director), British music video director", "* David Wilson (born 1948), birth name of Scottish stage and television actor David Rintoul", "* David Wilson (criminologist) (born 1957), British criminologist", "* David Wilson (Manitoba politician) (1858\u20131927), Irish-born politician in Manitoba, Canada", "* David Wilson (New York politician) (1818\u20131870), New York assemblyman 1852, editor of Twelve Years a Slave", "* David Wilson (New Zealand politician) (1880\u20131977), New Zealand politician and diplomat", "* David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn (born 1935), British administrator, governor of Hong Kong (1987\u20131992), diplomat and Sinologist", "* Soldier Wilson (David Wilson, 1883\u20131906), English footballer who played for Leeds City", "* David Wilson (Queen's Park footballer) (1880\u20131926), Scottish footballer (Queen's Park FC and Scotland)", "* David Wilson (footballer, born 1881) (1881\u2013?), Scottish footballer, played for Hearts, Everton, Portsmouth", "* David Wilson (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u2013?), Scotland international footballer; after retiring he was manager for Nelson and Exeter City in England", "* David Wilson (footballer, born c. 1908) (1908\u20131992), English footballer who played for Hamilton Academical and Stranraer in the 1930s", "* David Wilson (footballer, born 1969), footballer who began his career at Manchester United (1980s)", "* David Wilson (footballer, born 1994), Scottish footballer who plays for Partick Thistle", "* David Wilson (Scottish football manager) (born 1974), Scottish football manager of Gibraltar national football team", "* David Wilson (rugby union, born 1967), Australian rugby union footballer", "* David Wilson (rugby union, born 1985), English rugby union player", "* David Wilson (hurdler) (born 1951), British hurdler", "* David Wilson (swimmer) (born 1966), Australian swimmer", "* David Wilson (cricketer, born 1917) (1917\u20132005), English cricketer", "* David Wilson (cricketer, born 1966), English cricketer", "* David Wilson (New Zealand cricketer) (1914\u20131989), New Zealand cricketer", "* David Wilson (figure skating) (born 1966), Canadian figure skating choreographer", "* David Wilson (defensive back) (born 1970), American football defensive back", "* David Wilson (sprinter) (born 1977), Guamanian sprinter", "* David Wilson (running back) (born 1991), American football running back", "* David Wilson (sex offender) (born 1984), British criminal", "* David Wilson (hotelier) (1808\u20131880), hotelier", "* Sir David Wilson, 1st Baronet (1855\u20131930), Scottish landowner and agriculturalist", "* David Wilson (dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin) (1871\u20131957), Irish Anglican priest and hymnist", "* David Wilson (dean of Aberdeen and Orkney) (1805\u20131880)", "* David Wilson (barrister) (1879\u20131965), Australian barrister", "* David Wilson (Royal Marines officer) (born 1949), Royal Marine general", "* David Wilson (murderer) (died 1998), executed Saint Kitts and Nevis criminal", "* David Wilson (university administrator), American academic, Chancellor of University of Wisconsin Colleges", "* W.
