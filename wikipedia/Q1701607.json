He conducted anthropological data collection of the Africans he encountered on mission. \nRoscoe was born in 1861, during the height of the Victorian era.  Roscoe's career heavily echoed the Victorian notion of improving natives under British rule. He studied civil engineering before joining the Anglican Church Missionary Society.  In 1884, on mission, he travelled to what became the Uganda Protectorate, and lived there among several African tribes until 1909. From his experiences in Africa, Roscoe wrote Twenty-Five Years in East Africa, which was published in 1921. He intended the book to be an anthropological reference for Britons.\nThe trajectory of Roscoe\u2019s career seems to mimic that of David Livingstone, and indeed, Livingstone was a prominent influence on Roscoe. Though Roscoe\u2019s attitude toward Africa\u2019s salvation was more pragmatic and less fervent than that of Livingstone, reflective of his later imperial era in which the British had already established their presence in Africa, he recognized Livingstone\u2019s contributions to British endeavours on the continent. He directly cited Livingstone\u2019s \u201cexcellent work in exposing [slavery],\u201d and references and expands upon Livingstone\u2019s ideas of how to best approach the continent.  Like Livingstone, Roscoe believed that Christianity would benefit the Africans, and like Livingstone, Roscoe also believed that the scientific study of Africa was necessary.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Ace double titles", "response": ["*D-273 MY Ernest Jason Fredericks Shakedown Hotel / John Roscoe and Michael Roscoe (as Mike Roscoe) The Midnight Eye (1958)"]}, {"page": "List of Ace titles in first DGS series", "response": ["*D-273 MY Ernest Jason Fredericks Shakedown Hotel / John Roscoe and Michael Roscoe (as Mike Roscoe) The Midnight Eye (1958)"]}, {"page": "List of Ace mystery double titles", "response": ["*D-273 MY Ernest Jason Fredericks Shakedown Hotel / John Roscoe and Michael Roscoe (as Mike Roscoe) The Midnight Eye (1958)"]}, {"page": "Kintu", "response": ["In the early 1900s, two similar oral traditions of the Kintu creation myth were recorded and published. One oral tradition recorded by John Roscoe differs from other myths in that Kintu was said to have been seduced by Nnambi into going with her to the sky. In addition, after completing the trials Ggulu tasked him with, he was given permission to marry Nnambi and returned to Uganda with various livestock and one plantation stalk to begin life on Earth.

It was charted by Norwegian cartographers from air photos taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition (1936\u201337). They gave the name Filla (the tatters) to a larger island here, presumably for the ragged outline of the feature as shown on the Norwegian chart. In 1952, John Roscoe made a study of this area as revealed in aerial photographs taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump (1946\u201347). He found that what the Norwegians had named Filla was in fact a cluster of small islands. He applied the name Filla Island to the largest of these as described."]}, {"page": "Soldat Island", "response": ["Soldat Island is an elongated rocky island,  long, lying south of Partizan Island in the south part of the entrance to Langnes Fjord, Vestfold Hills.
