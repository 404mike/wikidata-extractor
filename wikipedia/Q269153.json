She began her film career in the musical film London Town (1946). Although the film was a financial failure, Kendall continued to work regularly until her appearance in the comedy film Genevieve (1953) brought her widespread recognition. Prolific in British films, Kendall also achieved some popularity with American audiences, and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in the musical-comedy film Les Girls (1957).She began a romantic relationship with actor Rex Harrison after they appeared together in the comedy film The Constant Husband (1955) and they were married in 1957. Harrison learned from Kendall's doctor that she had been diagnosed with myeloid leukaemia, a fact that was kept from Kendall, who believed she was suffering from an iron deficiency. The actor cared for Kendall until her death at the age of 32.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gene Kelly", "response": ["When Kelly returned to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was beginning to feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture Brigadoon (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing him to make the film on studio backlots instead of on location in Scotland. This year also had him appear as a guest star with his brother Fred in the \"I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen\" routine in Deep in My Heart (1954). MGM's refusal to lend him out for Guys and Dolls and Pal Joey put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract that involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, It's Always Fair Weather (1955), co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his roller-skate dance routine to I Like Myself, and a dance trio with Michael Kidd and Dan Dailey that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of Cinemascope. MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal, and as a result It's Always Fair Weather premiered at 17 drive-in theatres around the Los Angeles metroplex. Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, Les Girls (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall, and Taina Elg. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film, The Happy Road (1957), set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly returned to stage work."]}, {"page": "George Cukor", "response": ["| Gene Kelly, Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall"]}, {"page": "May 21", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 Kay Kendall, English actress and comedian (d. 1959)"]}, {"page": "September 6", "response": ["*  1959   \u2013 Kay Kendall, English actress and comedian (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "1959", "response": ["** Kay Kendall, English actress (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Rex Harrison", "response": ["In 1957, Harrison married the actress Kay Kendall.
