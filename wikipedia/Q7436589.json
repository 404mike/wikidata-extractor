He later went on to play for Mansfield Town, Notts County, Bristol Rovers and York City, where he scored once against Swansea City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Barnsley F.C.", "response": ["Wilson moved to strengthen the squad and signed attacking duo Ashley Ward from Derby and Jan \u00c5ge Fj\u00f8rtoft from Sheffield United. Wilson further strengthened the squad by signing central defender Peter Markstedt. One of the highlights of the season was to follow as Barnsley gained a measure of revenge for their 7\u20130 defeat at Old Trafford. After being drawn against Manchester United in the FA Cup the team played admirably to secure a 1\u20131 draw. In the replay at Oakwell, two goals by Barnsley youth team graduate Scott Jones and a goal for John Hendrie were enough to dump Manchester United out of the FA Cup 3\u20132. Barnsley went on to lose 3\u20131 away at Newcastle United."]}, {"page": "Scott Jones", "response": ["Scott Jones may refer to:", "*Scott Jones (athlete) (born 1998), British shot putter", "*Scott Jones (curler) (born 1971), Canadian curler", "*Scott Jones (American football) (born 1966), American football offensive tackle", "*Scott Jones (Australian footballer) (born 1995), Australian rules footballer for Fremantle", "*Scott Jones (English footballer) (born 1975), English football defender", "*Scott Jones (Puerto Rican footballer) (born 1983), American soccer midfielder", "*Scott Jones (sheriff) (born 1967), sheriff of Sacramento County, California", "*Scott Jones, Canadian victim of anti-gay violence profiled in the documentary film Love, Scott", "*Scott Jones (Canadian civil servant), appointed in 2018 to head the Canadian Center for Cyber Security"]}, {"page": "2000 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||6 ||Scott Jones"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Scott Jones"]}]}}
