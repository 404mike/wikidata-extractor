Fischer was less experienced than Wise, who helped teach her as they worked together. She attempted \"to give a feeling of the place you were in [and] a sense of the momentum you needed\" through her compositions, which she felt were more atmospheric than Wise's. Funky Kong's theme had originally been written by Robin Beanland for an internal progress video about another Rare game, Killer Instinct (1994). Nintendo decided to use the track in a Donkey Kong Country promotional trailer; Tim Stamper liked the track and wanted to include it in the game itself, so Wise adopted it. Meanwhile, character voice clips were provided by various Rare employees. The chomping noises made by the Klaptrap enemy came from an artist who continually snapped his teeth as he worked, while Mark Betteridge provided the playable Kongs' voice clips and Sutherland voiced the Kremlings. During visits to the Twycross zoo, Wise attempted to record real animal noises for inclusion, but they proved too quiet to be captured by his microphone.", "Category:Video games scored by Robin Beanland"]}, {"page": "Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest", "response": ["The game's soundtrack was the focus of an OverClocked ReMix collaboration, Serious Monkey Business.

All the sound effects were created by Norgate and a lot of effort was put into combining and permuting sounds in different ways to give the game a satisfying feel. According to Hollis, whenever the player shoots a gun, up to nine different sound effects will randomly trigger. When the game was reviewed by Nintendo shortly before it was released, the company was slightly concerned about the amount of violence and gunplay. As a result, the team toned down the killing and added an end credits sequence that introduces all the non-player characters, giving the game a filmic sense.

According to Rare composer Robin Beanland, the year 2015 would be significant for the company. At E3 2015, a new compilation game, Rare Replay celebrating the studio's 30th anniversary, was introduced; it was released in August. The compilation, with 30 of the studio's published games, only included games that Rare owned the intellectual property to. Because of this, Rare's operations director Drew Quakenbush explains why GoldenEye 007 is not inclued in compilation. Rare Replay became the most pre-ordered game shown at E3 that year and received critical acclaim upon launch. A new game, Sea of Thieves, which was a multiplayer adventure game marketed as \"The Best Game That Rare Has Ever Made\", was introduced at E3 that year. It was delayed at the following year's conference and was released on 20 March 2018.

The parodies helped the developers come up with ideas for music, sound, design, and gameplay.
