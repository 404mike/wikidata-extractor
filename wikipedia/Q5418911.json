He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. Having debuted in the Second XI Championship in 1990 for Derbyshire, he was to soon become a focal point of their financial troubles, as he only managed to play one County Championship game.\nMcCray also played for the Bain Clarkson Trophy between 1990 and 1993 and, in 2002, reprised his career by playing one match for Cheshire, for whom he had played prior to entering First-class cricket.\nMcCray often played as a lower-order/tailender batsman in List A cricket, sharing this role with Denmark's Ole Mortensen. Notably, despite bowling 42 overs of cricket in his first-class career, and having a decent ratio of maidens to overs, he failed to take a single wicket.\nHe is now a teacher of physical education at Parrs Wood High School in Manchester, and captain of Cheadle Hulme CC's 'Over 40's' team.\nRobbie McCray.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Uttoxeter Road", "response": ["The ground first appears on maps in 1924. Although located in Staffordshire, it was Derbyshire who used the ground for two List A matches, one in the 1991 Refuge Assurance League against Glamorgan and another against Hampshire in the 1993 AXA Equity & Law League. In the first match, Derbyshire made 251 all out from 39 overs, with Alan Warner's 51 the highest score of the innings. Daren Foster returned best figures for Glamorgan, with figures of 3/30. Despite 101 run from Matthew Maynard, Glamorgan fell 29 runs short of their target, with Ewan McCray taking the best figures of the innings with 4/49. The second match was abandoned without a ball bowled."]}, {"page": "McCray", "response": ["*Ewan McCray, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Poundswick Grammar School", "response": ["*Ewan McCray, former Derbyshire cricketer"]}]}}
