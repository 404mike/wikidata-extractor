Educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, he worked as a lecturer at University College London, but retired in 1987. He was a specialist on the works of the Roman poet Vergil and published five commentaries (2000\u20132013) on individual books of his Aeneid. This series of commentaries was described by the Latinist James O'Hara as \"one of the most remarkably productive and rich periods of publication of any modern classicist\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eduard Fraenkel", "response": ["In her 2000 book A Memoir: People and Places, the philosopher Mary Warnock wrote that Fraenkel had touched her and another female student against their will in the summer of 1943. According to Warnock, Fraenkel apologised for his actions after being confronted in a letter by Jocelyn Toynbee, then a Classics tutor at Newnham College, Cambridge. In 1990, the Latinist Nicholas Horsfall stated that \"[Fraenkel] did enjoy, warmly, but most decorously, female beauty\". His statement was criticised by the ancient historian Mary Beard, who described it as a probable \"defence mechanism\" against further dissemination of knowledge of Fraenkel's behaviour. In 2017, it was reported that the undergraduate student body of Corpus Christi College had voted to request the renaming of a room named after Fraenkel and the removal of his portrait and a commemorative plaque on account of these allegations."]}, {"page": "Tabula iliaca", "response": ["The term is conventionally applied to some twenty-oneSadurska 1964 carefully catalogued a corpus of nineteen tabulae; two more had been added to the list by 1985, according to W.

Little can be said about their sizes, since none survives complete. It appears that the largest rectangular tablet is 25\u00a0cm by 42\u00a0cm. The border scenes, where they can be identified, are largely derived from the Epic Cycle; eleven of the small marble tablets are small pictorial representations of the Trojan War portraying episodes from the Iliad, including two circular ones on the Shield of Achilles. Another six panels depict the sack of Ilium. On the reverse of the Borgia Tabula is a list of titles and authors of epic works, with stichometry, a listing of the number of lines in each epic; though these have occasioned great interest, W. McLeod demonstrated that, far from representing the tradition of Hellenistic scholarship, in every case where facts can be checked with the accepted canon, the compiler of the Borgia Table errs, citing an otherwise unattested Danaides, ascribing a new poem to Arctinus. McLeod suggests literary fakery designed to impress the nouveaux-riches as embodied by the fictional character Trimalchio, who is convinced that Troy was taken by Hannibal; Nicholas HorsfallHorsfall, \"Stesichorus at Bovillae?\", Journal of Hellenic Studies 99 (1997:26-48) especially pp 33-35; McLeod 1985: 163-65 finds the \"combination of error and erudition\" designed to impress just such eager newly educated consumers of culture with showy but spurious proofs of their erudition: \"The Borgia Table is a pretense of literacy for the unlettered,\" is McLeod's conclusion.McLeod 1985:165.
