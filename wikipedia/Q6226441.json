His repertoire ranged from Bach and Purcell to contemporary works, and embraced the major heldentenor roles in Richard Wagner's operas. For more than 40 years, with only a four-year interruption for military service during World War I, he overcame the limitations of a voice that was not naturally large by impressing listeners with his intense artistic expression, lively diction, musical versatility and memorable stage presence.\nCoates spent some time on the European continent, toured Australia and South Africa in 1912\u201313 and performed in North America in the 1890s and again in 1925. He performed most often, however, in his native country and became a beloved figure at England's regional music festivals. Elgar's Dream of Gerontius was one of his specialties. After 1921, he limited his performances to the concert stage and recitals, still performing a wide-ranging repertoire, but championing English composers. A dispute with music publishers about royalties clouded his later years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick Delius", "response": ["Although Delius achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music.

He was inspired by the music on hearing the concert performance in May 1903 just preceding the ceremonial opening of Westminster Cathedral.W. & R. Elwes 1935, p. 136. The religious authenticity of his interpretation was immediately recognised.W. & R. Elwes 1935, pp. 136\u20138. He performed the work 118 times in all. He was also completely identified with the role of the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion. His appearances at the Three Choirs Festivals, and at those of Peterborough and Norwich, became annual fixtures. In 1908 at the Norwich Festival he was partnered (according to Henry J. Wood) in Gerontius by the Dutch contralto Julia Culp, and in the same festival performed Bach's Magnificat with Louise Kirkby Lunn and Herbert Witherspoon.H. J. Wood, My Life of Music (Gollancz, London 1946 edn), p. 214. In 1909 Elwes sang Gerontius and the St Matthew Passion Evangelist in New York under Walter Damrosch.M.

Housman and the music of Elgar, and his death soon after the First World War, reinforce his embodiment of the lost Edwardian generation, perhaps the last in which his religious conviction could so thoroughly have endeared him to so many. At much the same time the Glasgow Orpheus Choir instituted a Gervase Elwes Silver Medal, and the Feis Ceoil in Dublin inaugurated its Gervase Elwes Memorial Cup.
