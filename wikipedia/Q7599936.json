A Professor Emeritus of Medical Cell Biology at Liverpool University, he is known for his pioneering research in the neurology, biochemistry and physiology of skeletal muscle. In 1967 he designed the first implantable neuromuscular stimulator and in 1969 he \"was the first to introduce the design of the buckle-type transducer for recording directly in vivo tendon forces in animals.\" His 1976 work with the implanted electrical \"pacemakers\" on rabbit muscles (published in Nature) clarified the relationship between nerve signals and muscle chemistry and established the adaptive nature of skeletal muscle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Salmons (surname)", "response": ["*Stanley Salmons (born 1939), British scientist"]}]}}
