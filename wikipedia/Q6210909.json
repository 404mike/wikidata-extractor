Argyle played two home games in a row, the first seeing the team's first win of 2012, with a 2\u20131 win over Burton Albion, where two goals from Simon Walton either side of a goal from Calvin Zola sealed the points. The second game saw Argyle rescue a late point thanks to Maxime Blanchard's first goal in English football, the goal lifted Argyle out of the bottom two with the French defender scoring an overhead kick to cancel out Pablo Mills' first half stoppage time goal for high flying Crawley Town. The last game of the month saw the Greens travel to Port Vale's Vale Park, where an 86th minute Tom Pope goal saw the hosts win 1\u20130. Youth goalkeeper Ollie Chenoweth left to join Truro City on loan, whilst striker Rory Patterson returned from his loan at Linfield and was immediately released. On the transfer deadline day, strikers Juvhel Tsoumou and Alex MacDonald joined on loan deals from Preston North End and Burnley respectively.", "|align=\"left\"|Joe Lennox", "|Joe Lennox"]}]}}
