In 1834-1835 he traveled to Italy, where he learned watercolor painting from the Scottsman William Leighton Leitch who was six years his senior; they became friends and toured and painted in the Lago Maggiore region in 1834, and Leitch was a great influence on Barab\u00e1s's future work.

He was influenced by Harding's oil and pencil technique and, like him, issued a number of drawing-books in the 1840s.  His use of chalk and stump on buff paper is similar to that of Robert Leman (1799\u20131863), while John Middleton strongly influenced his use of watercolour, particularly in around 1847."]}, {"page": "William L.
