He was the great-nephew of Rev. Adam Sedgwick (FRS 1821). He married Laura, daughter of Captain Robinson of Armagh.He was educated at Giggleswick School; Marlborough College; King's College London; and later at Trinity College, Cambridge where he was awarded his BA in 1878, and awarded MA  in 1881.  Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge (1880); Tutor, Trinity College (1897\u20131907); Lecturer in Animal Morphology, Cambridge University (1883\u20131890); Reader in Animal Morphology (1890\u20131907); Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy (1907\u20131909); Professor of Zoology, Imperial College, London (1909\u20131913); Chairman, Geological Survey of Great Britain.  He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1886.Sedgwick contributed articles to the 1911 edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Bateson first used the term \"genetics\" publicly at the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906.Bateson W. (1906) \"The progress of genetic research\" Report of the Third International Conference 1906 on Genetics, W. Wilks, ed. London, England:  Royal Horticultural Society. pp. 90\u201397.  From p. 91:  \" \u2026 the science itself [i.e. the study of the breeding and hybridisation of plants] is still nameless, and we can only describe our pursuit by cumbrous and often misleading periphrasis.  To meet this difficulty I suggest for the consideration of this Congress the term Genetics, which sufficiently indicates that our labors are devoted to the elucidation of the phenomena of heredity and variation:  in other words, to the physiology of Descent, with implied bearing on the theoretical problems of the evolutionist and the systematist, and application to the practical problems of breeders, whether of animals or plants.\"Gordon M. Shepherd (2010). \"Mendel's proposal that heredity is the outcome of 'independent factors' led William Bateson in England in 1906 to suggest the term 'genetics' as a specific biological term for the study of the rules of heredity. Following Bateson, Wilhelm Johannsen in Denmark in 1909 proposed the term 'gene' for the 'independent factors', as well as 'genotype' for the combination of genes in an individual and 'phenotype'\" (Creating modern neuroscience , p.\u00a017). Although this was three years before Wilhelm Johannsen used the word \"gene\" to describe the units of hereditary information, De Vries had introduced the word \"pangene\" for the same concept already in 1889, and etymologically the word genetics has parallels with Darwin's concept of pangenesis. Bateson and Edith Saunders also coined the word \"allelomorph\" (\"other form\"), which was later shortened to allele."]}, {"page": "Professor of Zoology (Cambridge)", "response": ["* Adam Sedgwick (1907)"]}, {"page": "History of genetics", "response": ["* 1905: William Bateson coins the term \"genetics\" in a letter to Adam SedgwickOnline copy of William Bateson's letter to Adam Sedgwick  and at a meeting in 1906.
