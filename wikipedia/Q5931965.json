Monteith (14 August 1874 \u2013 unknown) was a Scottish footballer who played as a goalkeeper for various clubs in the 1890s and 1900s, including Bristol City, West Ham United and Bury, with whom he won the FA Cup in 1903.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1903 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Bury led by this goal at half-time when, according to the Derby camp, things had gone \"better than they had dared hope\" \u2013 they were a goal down but didn't consider Bury's lead an insurmountable deficit. While Bury had been the better team so far and certainly deserved their lead, it had taken a desperate goal-line clearance by Ross to prevent a Derby goal after goalkeeper Hugh Monteith had been well beaten.", "|GK || Hugh Monteith "]}, {"page": "1898\u201399 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["For the second half, Southampton made a tactical change, switching Roddy McLeod to centre-forward with Duncan McLean moving to inside-right and within 12 minutes of the restart the scores were level, after long shots from Arthur Chadwick and Jock Robertson, the latter going in after a \"gentle hint\" from Harry Wood turned the ball past goalkeeper, Hugh Monteith who had come too far out of his goal. The Southampton fullbacks continued to protect Robinson in goal and the Saints gradually began to have the better of the game. A move involving Robertson and Wood ended with McLean giving Southampton the lead before Wood scored the fourth goal, with a simple header from a corner. Although Caie pulled one back for the home side, Southampton were able to hang on to their lead to win 4\u20133 and take the Championship for the third consecutive season."]}, {"page": "Tommy Moore (footballer)", "response": ["Born in Stoke-on-Trent, Moore played for Millwall Athletic before a controversial move to local rivals Thames Ironworks, making his debut on 10 September 1898 in a 3\u20130 away win against Shepherd's Bush. Moore was a member of the side which won the Southern Football League second division in 1898\u201399. The side conceded only 16 goals in 22 games, 21 of which saw Moore in goal. Regular appearances in the side continued until Thames Ironworks folded in 1900. Their successor club West Ham United included Moore in their second game of the season on 8 September 1900, a 3\u20131 defeat to Millwall Athletic. He replaced Hugh Monteith who had kept goal in the opening game of the season, a 7\u20130 defeat to Gravesend United. Moore would play only three further games for West Ham before he left to join Grays, his place as West Ham goalkeeper returning to Hugh Monteith. Although now playing football for what was a village side, Moore was a member of the Grays side which knocked West Ham, with Monteith in goal, out of the FA Cup on 16 November 1901 at the Memorial Grounds. This game is quoted as being West Ham's first defeat in a giant-killing."]}, {"page": "1900\u201301 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["Many of the playing staff continued with the new club. The likes of Bill Joyce, Kenny McKay and Albert Carnelly had departed, but Tommy Moore, Syd King, Charlie Craig, Charlie Dove, George Neil, Bob Allan, Roddy McEachrane, Fred Corbett, Frankie Taylor and Len Walker all played a part in the season. Players signed from other clubs before the start of the season included Hugh Monteith from Bristol City, Billy Grassam and Jimmy Reid from Burslem Port Vale, Luke Raisbeck from Middlesbrough, Fergus Hunt from Woolwich Arsenal, Fred Fenton from Gainsborough Trinity, and Albert Kaye from Chatham. Walter Tranter, who had played for the Ironworks before spending the previous season at Chatham, was also signed. Tom Robinson, the previous trainer, also remained, and Abe Norris was appointed. Of the former Ironworks players, only Tranter, Craig, Dove, and captain McEachrane, featured in the opening fixture against Gravesend United.", "The largest home attendance came in an FA Cup fifth qualifying round fixture against local side Clapton on 8 December. A crowd of 10,000 attended the match, which ended 1\u20131. The Hammers went on to win the replay at the Old Spotted Dog Ground 3\u20132 after Billy Grassam scored a hat-trick. The Clapton \u2018keeper Harry Earle (whose son later played for West Ham) had been at fault for the second after running out and leaving his goal unguarded. West Ham progressed to the intermediate round of the competition, featuring teams that had overcome the qualifying rounds and those that had been given byes.

Then followed a loss to Bristol City and three victories, over Swindon Town, Watford and Luton Town, before the club\u2019s worst defeat of the season on 16 February. This came at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur, a 4\u20131 loss in which Tommy Moore, deputising in goal for Hugh Monteith who had lumbago, was at fault for three of the goals. This would prove to be his final appearance for the club and he left at the end of the season after three years of service.", "|data-sort-value=\"1\"|GK||data-sort-value=\"Montieth, Hugh\"|Hugh Monteith || 24 || 0 || 6 || 0 || 30 || 0"]}]}}
