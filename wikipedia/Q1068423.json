Falconer's book Introduction to quantitative genetics was written in 1960 and became a valuable reference for generations of scientists. Its latest edition dates back to 1996 and is coauthored by Trudy Mackay.Falconer graduated with first class honors in zoology from the University of St Andrews in 1940. He then received his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1943. He eventually got an honorary ScD from Cambridge in 1969.In 1951, Falconer described a novel mouse mutant that he called reeler for its peculiar gait. Later research using these mice has led to the discovery of reelin, a protein playing important roles in corticogenesis, neuronal migration, and plasticity.\nIn 1964, he introduced the use of liability threshold models into human disease & trait modeling.In 1973, he was announced as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Quantitative genetics", "response": ["* Douglas Scott Falconer"]}, {"page": "Henrik Kacser", "response": ["He was elected to the Fellowship of The Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1990.

Waddington's initial solution to staff accommodation problems in Edinburgh was the acquisition of the nearby Mortonhall and an experiment in collegiate living, from which Eric Reeve's wife, the artist Edith Simon drew inspiration for her novel The Past Masters (titled House of Strangers in the USA).Simon, E.
