He began as a banjo and 12-string guitar player before becoming a Chicago-style blues harmonica player after hearing Little Walter. Working by day as a panel beater, he ran an unsuccessful skiffle club before meeting Korner, then Davies and Korner opened a London Rhythm and Blues club \"England's Firstest and Bestest Skiffle Club\", later known as the \"London Blues and Barrelhouse Club\".

After touring the UK and headlining a residency at the Marquee, by October 1962 there was musical tension in the band as some members wanted to play crowd pleasers like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs while Cyril Davies and others members were blues purists who wanted to play what they saw as only genuine Chicago-style R&B.But note that Alexis Korner recalls the split was because he, Heckstall-Smith, Baker and Jack Bruce were moving in a more jazz-based direction \u2013 Newman, Richard.

Following his departure from Blues Incorporated in October 1962, Davies then formed the Cyril Davies All-Stars in November 1962 and recorded five tracks for Pye Records, who had announced an R&B label featuring music imported from Davies' favourite Chicago musicians (\"Country Line Special\", \"Chicago Calling\", \"Preachin' the Blues\", \"Sweet Mary\" and \"Someday Baby\"). The original line-up was largely recruited from Screaming Lord Sutch's Savages, and featured both Long John Baldry and Davies on vocals to give Davies room to play harmonica.
