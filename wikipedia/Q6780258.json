The best known include The History of Little Henry and his Bearer (1814), The History of Henry Milner (1822\u20131837), and The History of the Fairchild Family (1818\u20131847). Her evangelicalism permeated her early writings, but her later works cover common Victorian themes such as domesticity. After an uneventful childhood, she married Captain Henry Sherwood and moved to India, converted to evangelical Christianity and began to write for children. Though intended for children of military encampments there, her work was well received in Britain, where the Sherwoods returned after a decade. She opened a boarding school and published scores of texts for children and the poor. She has been called \"one of the most significant authors of children's literature of the nineteenth century\". Her depictions of domesticity and British relations with India may have influenced many young readers, but her work fell from favour as children's literature broadened in the late 19th century.", "link_mentions": {}}}
