Issues had further arisen regarding the treatment of prisoners at Gladstone by the 1920s. In 1924, a released prisoner told The News that \"any man who has served six months in Gladstone Gaol has been through hell\". In 1925, Chief Secretary James Jelley inspected the jail to investigate issues around the \"harshness of confinement\". In 1939, it was taken over by the military for use as an internment camp, with all its prisoners transferred to Adelaide. Its use as an internment camp was not long lived; it was used as a military detention barracks for a period, but spent much of the next fifteen years in a state of disuse."]}, {"page": "Dorothy Coombe", "response": ["Coombe began with the Government Workers Association as a typist, and was subsequently promoted to assistant secretary in 1917.

In 1928, she became the first woman in South Australia to appear before the Industrial Court in the absence of union secretary Frank Nieass. It was reported in 1930 that she had been appointed union secretary upon Nieass' election to parliament, which would have made her one of the first woman union secretaries in Australia; however, Nieass was ultimately reappointed as a part-time secretary following a restructure of union management. She retired from the union as assistant secretary on 6 August 1948 after 32 years with the union; it was reported that her service was \"believed to be a record for a woman union official\"."]}, {"page": "Australian Government Workers Association", "response": ["It was founded on 26 May 1906 by Ernest Roberts as the South Australian Railways General Workers' Association, but in August that year broadened its reach and renamed itself the South Australian Government General Workers' Association.

A number of South Australian Labor figures served in union leadership, including Edward Alfred Anstey, John McInnes, Ralph Jacobi, Frank Nieass, John Price and George Weatherill, while Dorothy Coombe was a notable early woman union official.
