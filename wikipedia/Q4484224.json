Oldham played a Friday night match versus local rival Stockport County, who sat in 7th place at the time. Oldham controlled the first half of the match, as an Andy Liddell goal in the 24th minute gave them a 1\u20130 halftime lead. However, Stockport dominated the second half, scoring three goals en route to giving Oldham their first defeat of the season. An 82nd-minute goal from Stockport defender Michael Raynes secured the victory, as the Hatters defeated Oldham 3\u20131. After dropping to third place, Oldham looked to regain the top spot in the league versus Hereford United. Lee Hughes got the action started quickly, scoring his fourth goal in the fifth minute of the game. Oldham continued their early pressure against the Hereford defence, which included Hughes earning Oldham a penalty kick after he was taken down in the area by Frenchman Bruno Ngotty\u2014with Andy Liddell converting on the penalty to give Oldham a 2\u20130 advantage. Wolves loaned defender Daniel Jones netted in the 36th minute for the Latics, giving the home side a 3\u20130 lead at the halftime break. Stephen O'Leary picked up a yellow card in the 81st minute for taking down Jones with a bad challenge, and was sent off only a minute later, forcing Hereford to play out the final minutes with only ten men. Danny Whitaker took advantage of the sending off, netting the final goal in the 90th. Oldham played their third game of the month on 18 October against Leicester. A lackluster first half of action led to scoreless action until the 54th minute, when a Steve Howard header gave the visitors a 1\u20130 lead. Danny Whitaker equalised a quarter-hour later, earning a 1\u20131 draw as Oldham maintained an unbeaten home record. Three days later, Oldham traveled to Memorial Stadium to face Bristol Rovers. A solid attack was stifled by Rovers goalkeeper Steve Phillips, who stopped all seven shots that were on target. Rickie Lambert netted his 11th goal of the season in the 16th minute, which led the way to a Chris Lines goal in the 35th minute. Phillips and Oldham's Mark Crossley both kept out the opposition for the remainder of the match, as Oldham dropped their second consecutive away match. For their second straight away match, Oldham faced Swindon Town who sat in 18th place in League One. Oldham looked to be in control in the first 20 minutes of the match, putting pressure on Swindon's net without any success. Shortly after their barrage on the goal, defender Sean Morrison scored for Swindon. A handball in the penalty area by Lee Hughes gave Swindon the opportunity to net another in the 34th minute, which was converted by Jack Smith to double Swindon's lead. The ball was bogged down in midfielder for second half, as neither side put pressure on goal\u2014letting Swindon wrap up their third home victory of the season. A Lewis Alessandra assured that Oldham would end October on a high note, as the striker scored his first hat trick in a 3\u20130 victory over Scunthorpe United. The 19-year-old led Oldham struck first in the 26th, before quickly earning his hat trick in the second half with goals in the 50th and 60th minutes. Oldham's 3\u20130 win over the Iron was Scunthorpe's first loss since 16 October, and helped the Latics move to 4th place in the league to end October."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|Steve Phillips||0||4"]}]}}
