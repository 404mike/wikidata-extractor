Ipswich were in charge early on in the match and saw an early chance from Crawford go wide as he failed to convert Jimmy Leadbetter's cross.  Ipswich's Inside forwards were covering a lot of ground in both attack and defence, and this soon took its toll as Tottenham remained patient and took the lead through Greaves in the 36th minute.  Peter Baker's pass to Bobby Smith was flicked into space for Greaves to run on and shoot past Ipswich's goalkeeper Roy Bailey.  Five minutes later Smith's backheel from a Greaves pass deceived Ipswich defender Andy Nelson, and Smith doubled Tottenham's lead, who went in 2\u20130 at half-time.  The second half saw Tottenham's veteran defensive midfielder Danny Blanchflower move up the pitch and provided space for his forwards, with John White's pass allowing Greaves to slip the ball past Bailey for 3\u20130.  An injury to Ipswich defender Larry Carberry left the East Anglian club even weaker; Greaves beat five players only to slice his shot wide of the target after side-stepping Bailey.  With less than ten minutes remaining, White headed in from a Terry Medwin pass.  Roy Stephenson scored a late consolation goal for Ipswich but Medwin completed Tottenham's scoring, with a shot following a pass from Greaves to end the match 5\u20131.", "|DF ||2 || Larry Carberry"]}, {"page": "Adam Blakeman (footballer)", "response": ["He is the grandson of Larry Carberry, who won a League Championship medal with Ipswich Town in 1962 as a member of Alf Ramsey's team that won the Second Division the previous season.
