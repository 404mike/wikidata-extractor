The Old Norse Edda supplied much of the material for Das Rheingold, while Die Walk\u00fcre was largely based on the V\u00f6lsunga saga. Siegfried contains elements from the Eddur, the V\u00f6lsunga saga and Thidrekssaga. The final G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung draws from the 12th-century German poem, the Nibelungenlied, which appears to have been the original inspiration for the Ring.For a detailed examination of Wagner's sources for the Ring and his treatment of them, see, among other works, Deryck Cooke's unfinished study of the Ring, I Saw the World End , and Ernest Newman's Wagner Nights. Also useful is a translation by Stewart Spencer (Wagner's 'Ring of the Nibelung': Companion, edited by Barry Millington) which, as well as containing essays, including one on the source material which provides an English translation of the entire text that strives to remain faithful to the early medieval Stabreim technique Wagner used."]}, {"page": "Anton Bruckner", "response": ["The revision issue has generated controversy. A common explanation for the multiple versions is that Bruckner was willing to revise his work on the basis of harsh, uninformed criticism from his colleagues. \"The result of such advice was to awaken immediately all the insecurity in the non-musical part of Bruckner's personality,\" musicologist Deryck Cooke writes. \"Lacking all self-assurance in such matters, he felt obliged to bow to the opinions of his friends, 'the experts,' to permit ... revisions and even to help make them in some cases.\"Cooke, New Grove (1980), 3:360. This explanation was widely accepted when it was championed by Bruckner scholar Robert Haas, who was the chief editor of the first critical editions of Bruckner's works published by the International Bruckner Society; it continues to be found in the majority of program notes and biographical sketches concerning Bruckner. Haas's work was endorsed by the Nazis and so fell out of favour after the war as the Allies enforced denazification.", "\"The Bruckner Problem\" refers to the difficulties and complications resulting from the numerous contrasting versions and editions that exist for most of the symphonies.H.

The case of Haydn is simpler, since we are not faced with two or more alternatives but with one.\" The term gained currency following the publication (in 1969) of an article dealing with the subject, \"The Bruckner Problem Simplified\" by musicologist Deryck Cooke, which brought the issue to the attention of English-speaking musicians.Cooke(1969)"]}, {"page": "Das Rheingold", "response": ["A few Rhinegold characters originate from outside the Eddas.

The three Rhinemaidens do not appear in any of the sagas and are substantially Wagner's own invention; he also provided their individual names Woglinde, Wellgunde and Flo\u00dfhilde.  In his analysis of The Ring Deryck Cooke suggests the Rhinemaidens' origin may be in the Nibelungenlied, where three water sprites tease the characters Hagen and Gunther.  Wagner may also have been influenced by the Rhine-based German legend of Lorelei, who lures fishermen on to the rocks by her singing, and by the Greek Hesperides myth in which three maidens guard a  golden treasure."]}, {"page": "Gustav Mahler", "response": ["Mahler left the Conservatory in 1878 with a diploma but without the silver medal given for outstanding achievement.Carr, pp. 23\u201324 He then enrolled in the University of Vienna (he had, at his father's insistence, sat and with difficulty passed the \"Matura,\" a highly demanding final exam at a Gymnasium, which was a precondition for university studies) and followed courses which reflected his developing interests in literature and philosophy. After leaving the University in 1879, Mahler made some money as a piano teacher, continued to compose, and in 1880 finished a dramatic cantata, Das klagende Lied (\"The Song of Lamentation\"). This, his first substantial composition, shows traces of Wagnerian and Brucknerian influences, yet includes many musical elements which musicologist Deryck Cooke describes as \"pure Mahler.\"Cooke, p. 22 Its first performance was delayed until 1901, when it was presented in a revised, shortened form.Sadie, p. 527", "Deryck Cooke and other analysts have divided Mahler's composing life into three distinct phases: a long \"first period,\" extending from Das klagende Lied in 1880 to the end of the Wunderhorn phase in 1901; a \"middle period\" of more concentrated composition ending with Mahler's departure for New York in 1907; and a brief \"late period\" of elegiac works before his death in 1911.Cooke, pp. 27, 71, 103", "A technical device much used by Mahler is that of \"progressive tonality,\" which Deryck Cooke describes as \"the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that in which it was stated,\" and which is often used \"to symbolise the gradual ascendancy of a certain value by progress from one key to another over the whole course of a symphony.\"Deryck Cooke, RLPO notes 29 May 1964 This technique was also used by Mahler's Danish contemporary Carl Nielsen. Mahler first employed the device in an early song, Erinnerung (\"Memory\"), and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies. For example, the predominant key of the First Symphony is D major; at the beginning of the Finale, the \"conflict\" movement, the key switches to F minor, and only after a lengthy battle gets back to D, near the end. The Second Symphony begins in C minor and ends in E flat. The movements of the Fifth Symphony progress successively from C-sharp minor to A minor, then D major, F major and finally to D major. The Sixth Symphony, unusually for Mahler, begins and ends in the same key, A minor, signifying that in this case the conflict is unresolved.Cooke, pp. 83\u201387", "Deryck Cooke argues that Mahler's popularity escalated when a new, postwar generation of music-lovers arose, untainted by \"the dated polemics of anti-romanticism\" which had affected Mahler's reputation in the inter-war years. In this more liberated age, enthusiasm for Mahler expanded even into places\u2014Spain, France, Italy\u2014which had long been resistant to him.Cooke, pp. 3\u20134 Robert Carr's simpler explanation for the 1950s Mahler revival is that \"it was the long-playing record [in the early 1950s] rather than the Zeitgeist which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible. Mahler's work became accessible and repeatable in the home.\" In the years following his centenary in 1960, Mahler rapidly became one of the most performed and most recorded of all composers, and has largely remained thus. In Britain and elsewhere, Carr notes, the extent of Mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut, bringing problems of over-familiarity. Harold Schonberg comments that \"it is hard to think of a composer who arouses equal loyalty,\" adding that \"a response of anything short of rapture to the Mahler symphonies will bring [to the critic] long letters of furious denunciation.\"Schonberg, p. 137"]}, {"page": "Selwyn College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Deryck Cooke"]}, {"page": "Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["The orchestra under Paavo Berglund made the world premiere recording of Sibelius's Kullervo in 1970.

In it he claimed to have isolated and named all of the recurring motifs in the cycle (the motif of \"Servitude\", the \"Spear\" or \"Treaty\" motif, etc.), often leading to absurdities or contradictions with Wagner's actual practice. Some of the motifs he identified began to appear in the published musical scores of the operas, arousing Wagner's annoyance; his wife Cosima Wagner quoted him as saying \"People will think all this nonsense is done at my request!\". In fact Wagner himself never publicly named any of his leitmotifs, preferring to emphasize their flexibility of association, role in the musical form, and emotional effect. The practice of naming leitmotifs nevertheless continued, featuring in the work of prominent Wagnerian critics Ernest Newman, Deryck Cooke and Robert Donington."]}, {"page": "Frederick Delius", "response": ["For the rest of his lifetime Delius's more popular pieces were performed in England and abroad, often under the sponsorship of Beecham, who was primarily responsible for the Delius festival in October\u2013November 1929. In a retrospective comment on the festival The Times critic wrote of full houses and an apparent enthusiasm for \"music which hitherto has enjoyed no exceptional vogue\", but wondered whether this new acceptance was based on a solid foundation. After Delius's death Beecham continued to promote his works; a second festival was held in 1946, and a third (after Beecham's death) at Bradford in 1962, to celebrate the centenary of Delius's birth. These occasions were in the face of a general indifference to the music; writing in the centenary year, the musicologist Deryck Cooke opined that at that time, \"to declare oneself a confirmed Delian is hardly less self-defamatory than to admit to being an addict of cocaine and marihuana\".

A decade later Simpson was energetic in his opposition to a cost-cutting reorganisation that ultimately proposed the decommissioning of five of the eleven BBC orchestras. During the ensuing musicians' strike (which caused the cancellation of the first several weeks of the 1980 BBC Promenade Concerts) Simpson chose to disregard BBC staff regulations and discuss the matter with a national newspaper; he then resigned from the corporation, publicly alleging a \"degeneration of traditional BBC values in the scramble for ratings\".

In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson, and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has been compared by Deryck Cooke to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.\u00a09 as a defining human statement for its century.", "Until 1901, Mahler's compositions had been heavily influenced by the German folk-poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn (\"The Youth's Magic Horn\"), which he had first encountered around 1887. (4. Prague 1885\u201386 and Leipzig 1886\u201388) The music of Mahler's many Wunderhorn settings is reflected in his Symphonies No.\u00a02, No.\u00a03 and No.\u00a04, which all employ vocal as well as instrumental forces. From about 1901, however, Mahler's music underwent a change in character as he moved into the middle period of his compositional life.Cooke, p. 71 Here, the more austere poems of Friedrich R\u00fcckert replace the Wunderhorn collection as the primary influence; the songs are less folk-related, and no longer infiltrate the symphonies as extensively as before.Mitchell, Vol. II p. 32 During this period Symphonies No.\u00a05, No.\u00a06 and No.\u00a07 were written, all as purely instrumental works, portrayed by Mahler scholar Deryck Cooke as \"more stern and forthright\u00a0..., more tautly symphonic, with a new granite-like hardness of orchestration\".", "The years after World War II saw a number of notable performances of the Eighth Symphony, including Sir Adrian Boult's broadcast from the Royal Albert Hall on 10\u00a0February 1948, the Japanese premiere under Kazuo Yamada in Tokyo in December 1949, and the Australian premiere under Sir Eugene Goossens in 1951. A Carnegie Hall performance under Stokowski in 1950 became the first complete recording of the symphony to be issued. After 1950 the increasing numbers of performances and recordings of the work signified its growing popularity, but not all critics were won over. Theodor W. Adorno found the piece weak, \"a giant symbolic shell\";Carr, p. 186 this most affirmative work of Mahler's is, in Adorno's view, his least successful, musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies.La Grange (2000), p. 928 The composer-critic Robert Simpson, usually a champion of Mahler, referred to Part\u00a0II as \"an ocean of shameless kitsch.\" Mahler biographer Jonathan Carr finds much of the symphony \"bland\", lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer's other symphonies. Deryck Cooke, on the other hand, compares Mahler's Eighth to Beethoven's Choral (Ninth) Symphony. To Cooke, Mahler's is \"the Choral Symphony of the twentieth century: like Beethoven's, but in a different way, it sets before us an ideal [of redemption] which we are as yet far from realising\u2014even perhaps moving away from\u2014but which we can hardly abandon without perishing\".Cooke, pp. 93\u201395"]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)", "response": ["Deryck Cooke estimates the symphony's duration to be 50 minutes, a moderate length for a symphony that Mahler considered to be \"of normal dimensions\".
