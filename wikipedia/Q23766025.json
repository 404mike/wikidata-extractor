The amended complaint in that action was the subject of a recent motion to dismiss with Defendants\u2019 counsel arguing, among other things, that Defendants purchased the painting in good faith at a public Christie\u2019s auction in London, that Oscar Stettiner did not actually own the subject painting, and that provenance research about the painting is being provided by experts in the field.

Arbitration was ongoing as of April 2016, with the defendants arguing that the painting had been legally purchased in good faith from Christie's, that Stettiner's claim of ownership was unproven, and that the Stettiner estate's case was bankrolled by individuals with a financial conflict of interest.

According to Maestracci, the painting was taken from his grandfather, Jewish Parisian art dealer Oscar Stettiner, by the Nazis during the German occupation of France. In 1939, Oscar Stettiner left the painting behind in France ahead of the German occupation. The Nazis took administration over the painting in 1941 and auctioned it off in 1944. In 1946, Oscar Stettiner filed a claim to recover the painting, but the French authorities were ultimately unable to find it. However, the French court recognized Oscar Stettiner as the owner of this painting, which still bears his name on label on the back of the painting.
