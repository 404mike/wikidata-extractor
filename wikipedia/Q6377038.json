She particularly praised the performances of the two leads: \"Christopher Eccleston, never knowingly under-intense, was perfectly cast as the Everybloke suddenly gifted with the ability to provide answers to the big questions and perform medium-sized miracles... Sharp, burdened (or perhaps liberated?) by bad hair and make-up for most of the film proved herself yet again to be one of Britain's finest actresses.\""]}, {"page": "The Worst Week of My Life", "response": ["The series were both critically acclaimed and popular, with the first series averaging 5 million viewers on BBC One.

Kathryn Flett, writing in London's The Observer, has called the books \"almost certainly a work of publishing (if not quite literary) genius...

Writing for The Times, Caitlin Moran praised Nesbitt's performance as \"surpringsly gripping\". Helen Rumbelow, also from The Times, reviewed the first episode and felt the opening \"a sequence of brilliant film-making\" but criticised the acting from Nesbitt and Graham as \"a touch too comedic\". The Telegraph felt the series gave \"a poignant sense of the ironies\" of the war in Iraq, praised writer Peter Bowker and summarised by calling the series \"Truly excellent\". Kathryn Flett wrote in The Guardian that \"Nesbitt was very good and easy to like\" but \"not the film's star\", feeling that performances by Stephen Graham and Warren Brown \"made the deeper, more lasting impression\".
