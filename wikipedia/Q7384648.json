His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008\u201309 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1\u20131 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying \"I do not see it as a big deal. It's not like the club has said to me we are putting you on the transfer list because we do not want you anymore\", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to \"pay a bit of money\". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3\u20132 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; \"moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is not what I want to do\". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3\u20130 home defeat."]}, {"page": "Ryan Williams", "response": ["Ryan Williams may refer to:", "*Ryan Williams (American football) (born 1990), American football player", "*Ryan Williams (Australian rules footballer) (born 1988), Australian former Australian rules footballer", "*Ryan Williams (BMX rider) (born 1994), Australian freestyle BMX and scooter rider", "*Ryan Williams (footballer, born 1978), English footballer", "*Ryan Williams (footballer, born 1991), English footballer", "*Ryan Williams (men's soccer, born 1996), American soccer midfielder", "*Ryan Williams (soccer, born 1993), Australian footballer for Oxford United F.C.", "*Ryan Williams (women's soccer) (born 1996), American soccer defender", "*Ryan Williams (computer scientist) (born 1979), American computer scientist", "*Ryan Williams (entrepreneur) (born 1988), technology entrepreneur", "*Ryan Williams (American politician) (born 1973), member of the Tennessee House of Representatives", "*Ryan Williams (Canadian politician)"]}, {"page": "Ryan Neil Williams", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ryan Williams (footballer, born 1978)"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Ryan Williams"]}, {"page": "Ryan Williams (footballer born 1978)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ryan Williams (footballer, born 1978)"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|20||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Ryan Williams"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|20||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Ryan Williams"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ryan Williams"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ryan Williams"]}]}}
