He was loaned out to Port Vale the following month, and in the 2015\u201316 season was loaned out to Scunthorpe United and Stevenage. He joined Maidstone United on loan for the latter part of the 2017\u201318 season. Following his release from Hull, he joined Woking in July 2018.

Going forward Page managed to adequately cover for the continuing absence of Pope by playing Ben Williamson as a lone striker supported by Louis Dodds in a central attacking midfield role. The next week's opponents, Chesterfield, were one place above Vale, but a 3\u20130 Chesterfield win put Vale four points and four places outside the play-offs; both chairman and manager described the performance as \"embarrassing\". This proved to be a temporary setback however, as Vale went on to beat Peterborough 2\u20131. A win over \"A500 derby\" rivals Crewe would then take Vale into the play-offs, but a 1\u20130 win completed a double over Vale for the \"Railwaymen\"; Neal saved a penalty he himself gave away but could not keep out Nicky Ajose's 39th-minute strike. Next opponents Barnsley tried to buy Tom Pope before Vale's visit to Oakwell. Pope played against Barnsley but it was goalkeeper Neal who opened the scoring after fumbling into his own net just before half-time; Barnsley went on to win the game 2\u20131.
