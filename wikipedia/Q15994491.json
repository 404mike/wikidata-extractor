Together with his long-time collaborator Leonard R Stephens, he established that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is the main substrate of receptor-controlled Type 1 phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), thus identifying PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as the key output signal produced by this enzyme.\nThey identified and isolated the GPCR-activated Type 1B PI3K (PI3K\u03a5) and, in a sustained body of work, defined its structure, explained its complex pattern of regulation by G\u03b2\u03a5 and Ras, and proved its role in inflammatory events in vivo. They - in parallel with Dario Alessi - identified phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 as the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-activated link between PI3K-1 activation and protein kinase B activation, a key pathway through which PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 formation regulates cell proliferation and survival.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Hawkins", "response": ["* Phillip Thomas Hawkins, molecular biologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2013", "response": ["# Phillip Thomas Hawkins"]}, {"page": "Leonard R.
