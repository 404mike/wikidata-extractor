She is most closely associated with Carroll Gibbons and the Savoy Orpheans, a band who regularly played at the Savoy Hotel in London; she made many studio recordings with this band.

He took exclusive leadership of the Savoy Hotel Orpheans, which recorded hundreds of popular songs (many of which were sung by Anne Lenner) between June 1932 and his death in 1954, all featuring Gibbons on piano. Starting in about 1931, he also recorded many sophisticated records featuring a piano-led small group playing pop tunes and medleys under the name of Carroll Gibbons and his Boy Friends, of which some contained tracks by singer Hildegarde."]}, {"page": "British dance band", "response": ["* Anne Lenner"]}, {"page": "1997 in jazz", "response": ["** Anne Lenner, English singer (born 1912)."]}, {"page": "Ann Lenner", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Lenner"]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 1997 in jazz, deaths of Anne Lenner, Arthur Prysock, Bernard Anderson, Beverly Peer, Big Nick Nicholas, Carola Standertskj\u00f6ld, Carson Smith, Charles Moffett, Chuck Andrus, Chuck Wayne, Dardanelle Hadley, Dick Marx, Dick Shearer, Doc Cheatham, Duncan Swift, Eddie Jones Eric Von Essen, Fela Kuti, George Chisholm, George Handy, Horst Lippmann, Hugh Lawson, Jimmy Witherspoon, Joe Roccisano, Johnny \"Hammond\" Smith, Johnny Coles, Johnny Mince, Lou Bennett, Louis Barbarin, Mouse Randolph, Rolf Ericson, Seldon Powell, Shake Keane, Stan Barker, St\u00e9phane Grappelli, Tete Montoliu, Thelma Carpenter, Thurman Green, Tommy Tedesco, Tommy Turrentine, Tony Williams, Wally Rose, and Zachary Breaux; birth of Barbra Lica.", "* 1912 in jazz, births of Al Lucas, Alix Combelle, Alvin Alcorn, Anne Lenner, Anselmo Sacasas, Asser Fagerstr\u00f6m, Beverly Peer, Bill Johnson, Bob Zurke, Clarence Profit, Dave Barbour, Don Byas, Erhard Bauschke, Ernst H\u00f6llerhagen, Franz Jackson, Fritz Schulz-Reichel, George T.
