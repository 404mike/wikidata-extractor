He is the former bassist and founding member of 1980s pop band, Frankie Goes to Hollywood. His elder brother, Gerard, was also a member of FGTH, but soon left the band.A musician from an early age, O'Toole co-wrote all of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's hits such as \"Relax\", \"Two Tribes\" and \"The Power of Love\". Frankie Goes to Hollywood primarily enjoyed success in 1984, at one time occupying the top two places in the UK Singles Chart. The band split in 1987.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frankie Goes to Hollywood", "response": ["Frankie Goes to Hollywood were an English synth-pop band formed in Liverpool in 1980. The group's best-known line-up comprised Holly Johnson (vocals), Paul Rutherford (backing vocals), Peter Gill (drums, percussion), Mark O'Toole (bass guitar) and Brian Nash (guitar).", "The group was reprised when Johnson joined Mark O'Toole (bass) and Peter \"Ped\" Gill to form FGTH. During a particularly fluid period of personnel changes, Jed O'Toole joined FGTH on guitar, and a female vocalist, Sonia Mazumder, was also a band member for the first Frankie gig at the Leeds nightclub \"The Warehouse\", supporting Hambi & The Dance. Paul Rutherford\u2014a member of the headline act who had also sung in seminal Liverpool punk band The Spitfire Boys\u2014apparently got so caught up in Frankie's performance that he effectively replaced Mazumder that very night. The new all-male musical line-up subsequently toured locally with a leather-clad female duo known as \"The Leatherpets\" and managed to fund promotional videos and demos, despite being eventually turned down by both Arista Records and Phonogram Inc. In October 1982, the group recorded a John Peel Session for BBC Radio 1, comprising the originals \"Krisco Kisses\", \"Two Tribes\", \"Disneyland\", and \"The World Is My Oyster\". Around this time Jed O'Toole left the group, to be replaced by the returning Brian Nash.", "The \"other three\", as Smash Hits labelled them, continued to work together in what turned out to be a vain attempt to resurrect \"Frankie\" with various singers including Dee Harris from Fashion and Grant Boult (Jeckyl Ice) from The Premise, who had opened the shows on the band's UK and European tours. Under the name Boss Dog, with Boult on vocals, the band were offered a major deal with Virgin Records but on the condition they work as Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Johnson challenged the use of the name and the deal soured. Boult and Brian Nash continued with the material written by The Shuffle Brothers and under the name Low they released \"Tearing My Soul Apart\" in 1992 on Swanyard Records. As \"Nasher\", Nash released a 2002 solo album entitled Ripe. Ped worked behind the scenes and scored a top ten hit with the group \"Lovestation\". Mark O'Toole moved to Florida and played with punk outfit \"Trapped by Mormons\".", "In 1998, a band calling itself alternately \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\" and \"The New Frankie Goes to Hollywood Featuring Davey Johnson\" began to tour the United States. The band consisted of none of the original members of the band and formed without their knowledge or consent. The impostor band was led by an American using the stage name Davey Johnson, who alternately claimed he was Holly Johnson's brother and had performed as an uncredited session musician on Welcome to the Pleasuredome. The members of the actual band and their producer Trevor Horn refuted both claims. Mark O'Toole, who had been living in Florida, became aware of the band and warned concert promoters not to hire them. Likewise, A Flock of Seagulls frontman Mike Score, who had been a Liverpool acquaintance of the members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, kicked the impostor band off his tour after discovering they were a fraud. After Holly Johnson contacted the trade magazine Pollstar to confirm that the American-based act was unauthorized, the impostor band was dropped by a booking agent, but continued to be booked by small clubs throughout the southern United States. The fake group continued to perform until at least September 2000, when a feature on the controversy was published in that month's issue of Spin.", "In 2003, the VH-1 program Bands Reunited brought Johnson, Rutherford, Gill, Nash, and Mark O'Toole together, in the hope of their agreeing to perform impromptu on the show. However, a reunion performance did not transpire. Both Johnson and Nash had reservations about performing at short notice in the contrived manner dictated by the TV show format.", "In 2004, a celebration of the 25th anniversary of Trevor Horn's involvement in the music industry a special concert took place at Wembley Arena in November, featuring three of the original FGTH line-up, Mark O'Toole, Peter (Ped) Gill and Paul Rutherford and another former member, Jed O'Toole. Original vocalist Johnson, who announced via the Internet that he would not be appearing, and guitarist Nash, who declined to appear for his own reasons, did not take part. Jed O'Toole took over guitar duties for the event, whilst an open audition was held for a new singer for the concert. Ryan Molloy was recruited as a result.", "* Mark O'Toole \u2013 vocals, bass (1980\u20131987, 2004\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "Relax (song)", "response": ["Ultimately lead vocalist Johnson was the only band member to perform on the record; the only contribution by the other members was a sample crafted from the sound of the rest of the band jumping into a swimming pool.

Look, 'Relax' had to be a hit.\" Despite the band's absence from the record, Horn said, \"I could never have done these records in isolation. There was no actual playing by the band, but the whole feeling came from the band.\" In a 2021 interview, Horn said that \"the band we signed weren\u2019t quite the band who had appeared on the original demo (of \"Relax\"), though we didn't know that at the time\": the demo had featured Mark O'Toole's brother Jed on guitar, who subsequently left to pursue a 9-to-5 career and was replaced by Brian Nash, who was a guitar novice at the time the single was recorded, although Horn acknowledged that he developed into a good guitarist by the time Welcome to the Pleasuredome was completed.
