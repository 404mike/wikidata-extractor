Contributions to neurology by Symonds include a highly accurate description of subarachnoid haemorrhage in 1924, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (which he termed \"otitic hydrocephalus\") in 1931.\nHe served in both the First and Second World Wars, initially in the ranks as a motorcycle despatch rider on the Western Front. After being wounded and invalided back to the United Kingdom, he completed his basic medical training and served as a medical officer, both on the front lines and attached to the Royal Flying Corps at Farnborough. In the mid-1930s he became a civilian consultant to the Royal Air Force and on the outbreak of the Second World War was commissioned as a group captain. By the end of the war he held the acting rank of air vice marshal and had been knighted.", "link_mentions": {}}}
