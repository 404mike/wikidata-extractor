Amidst the depopulation and poverty of the islanders they found that Calve Island was farmed by a single extended family, and stayed to help with the harvest, meeting two sisters, Margaret and Janet McDonald, who were locally renowned as competitive rowers. Alistair Dunnett (who went on to become editor of The Scotsman) wrote of how Calve showed the Scottish island not as a beautiful barren waste. 'It was on the contrary, a rich land, if neglected; fertile in all but faith'.Alistair Dunnett, 1934, quoted in . A book on the 1934 expedition was republished as:  Undertaking another such kayak expedition in 2018, the historian David Gange was disappointed to find that, unlike the signs of revival across so much of the Hebrides, Calve has no population and minimal agricultural activity. It stood for him as symbol of the fragility and lack of resilience in the current re-population of the Scottish Islands compared to the situation before the Clearances of the previous two centuries."]}, {"page": "Alastair MacTavish Dunnett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alastair Dunnett"]}, {"page": "Sir Alastair Dunnett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alastair Dunnett"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish short story writers", "response": ["* Alastair Dunnett"]}, {"page": "Alexander Beauchamp Cameron", "response": ["Lord Napier of Thirlestane Castle, Alastair Dunnett (editor of The Scotsman), Lord Provost John Millar, Sir Isaac Wolfston, Lord Rosebury, General Sir Henry Leask and The Earl of Inchcape."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 1998", "response": ["*Alastair Dunnett, 89, Scottish journalist and newspaper editor."]}, {"page": "Alastair M.
