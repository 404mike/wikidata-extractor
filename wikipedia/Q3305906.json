In chapter 10, the penultimate chapter, he presented 60 numbered paragraphs putting forth terms and their definitions that he proposed should be used in discussing political economy following those rules. This collection of terms and definitions is remarkable for two reasons: first, Malthus was the first economist to explicitly organize, define, and publish his terms as a coherent glossary of defined terms; and second, his definitions were for the most part well-formed definitional statements. Between these chapters, he criticized several contemporary economists\u2014Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, James Mill, John Ramsay McCulloch, and Samuel Bailey\u2014for sloppiness in choosing, attaching meaning to, and using their technical terms."]}, {"page": "1791 in literature", "response": ["*July 5 \u2013 Samuel Bailey, English philosopher and author (died 1870)"]}, {"page": "List of ethicists", "response": ["* Samuel Bailey"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Samuel Bailey"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Samuel Bailey, philosopher and author"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 18th century", "response": ["* Samuel Bailey, (1791\u20131870)"]}, {"page": "Bailey (surname)", "response": ["* Sam, Samantha and Samuel Bailey (disambiguation), multiple people", "**** Samuel Bailey (1791\u20131870), British philosopher and writer"]}, {"page": "List of names in A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Rationalists", "response": ["* Samuel Bailey"]}, {"page": "Value-form", "response": ["===Aristotle and Samuel Bailey===", "In particular, Marx's ideas about the forms of value were influenced by Samuel Bailey's criticism of Ricardo's theory of value.Derek Sayer, Marx's method.

In Capital, Volume II, Marx criticizes Bailey again for \"his general misunderstanding, according to which exchange-value equals value, the form of value is value itself\", leading to the mistaken belief that \"commodity values cease to be comparable once they no longer actively function as exchange-values, and cannot actually be exchanged for one another\".Karl Marx, Capital, Volume II, Penguin 1978, p. 186."]}, {"page": "Logodaedaly", "response": ["Samuel Bailey used the term with greater precision, distinguishing between logodaedaly and logomachy:"]}, {"page": "Joseph Lowe (economist)", "response": ["The first to use weighted index numbers, Lowe in effect anticipated the Laspeyres index.
