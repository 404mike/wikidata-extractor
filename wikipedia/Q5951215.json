Since their formation, the band had consisted of Gruff Rhys (lead vocals, guitar), Huw Bunford (lead guitar, vocals), Guto Pryce (bass guitar), Cian Ciaran (keyboards, synthesisers, various electronics, occasional guitar, vocals), Dafydd Ieuan (drums, vocals) and actor Rhys Ifans."]}, {"page": "Gruff Rhys", "response": ["When Ffa Coffi Pawb disbanded in 1993, Rhys and drummer Dafydd Ieuan, of Rhoscefnhir, Anglesey, who had played for Catatonia, Anhrefn, Hanner Pei and many other Welsh language bands, formed the basis of Super Furry Animals. They soon settled on a line-up consisting of Rhys on vocals and guitar, Ieuan on drums, his brother Cian Ciaran (formerly of WWZZ) on keyboards, Huw Bunford (formerly of U-Thant) on guitar and Guto Pryce on bass. This line-up has remained constant to the present day, although the role of each member has become more flexible, particularly in the studio."]}, {"page": "Guto Pryce", "response": ["Pryce was in the Welsh-language band , with his brother Iwan Pryce, Huw Bunford (also later of Super Furry Animals), Owen Powell (later of Catatonia) and others in a changing line-up, from 1989 to 1993. He recorded with Catatonia on their first two EPs before Super Furry Animals formed in 1993."]}, {"page": "Phantom Power (Super Furry Animals album)", "response": ["The group took a hands-on approach to the actual recording sessions for Phantom Power, engineering and producing themselves for the first time. Recording largely took place at AV Happenings during the second half of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as the band \"didn't really know what [they] were doing\". Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: \"we'd record a guitar and it'd sound rubbish and we had to figure out why. So we started experimenting with different tent designs. In the end it was the wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best\". The band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in the morning, a process that guitarist Huw Bunford has described as \"ghosts in the night ... a bit clandestine\". A brief two-week session with Gorwel Owen at Rockfield Studios saw some of the album's more \"straight ahead\" tracks recorded with live vocals before the band returned to AV Happenings and \"messed around\" with them. When the album was almost finished the band enlisted the services of Tony Doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded.", "The ten song D-A-D-D-A-D concept was eventually abandoned with Pryce stating \"we don't like constraining ourselves and if you've got a concept, you're doing that. And we had some other really nice tunes so we just chose the best songs\". According to Rhys the only plan the group stuck to was to make a \"more coherent\" record: \"In the past ... we'd put ideas kind of side by side, and on this record we wanted all those sounds to be more blended\". Following arguments over the track listing of previous album Rings Around the World, after a \"lot of songs\" were recorded necessitating four months worth of discussions about which tracks to leave off the record, the group recorded just 16 largely acoustic based songs during the sessions for Phantom Power. Rhys's initial batch of songs were augmented by, among others, the Huw Bunford penned \"Sex, War & Robots\", the first time the guitarist had had one of his songs included on a Super Furry Animals album and also the first time he had sung lead vocals for the group, \"Slow Life\", which grew out of an electronic piece of music keyboardist Cian Ciaran had been working on for several years and \"The Piccolo Snare\" which was partly written in the studio.", "After the more produced Rings Around the World, which relied heavily on computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power \"a little more human\" with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: \"with technology you can do anything these days, but sometimes less is more\". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded \"pretty good right from the start\" which also contributed to the decision to avoid \"over-tweak[ing] them in the studio\". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of \"sound effect and light music\" vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: \"he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: \"hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?\" And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room\".", "Hidden footage of the band firing machine guns can be reached by selecting the song \"The Undefeated\", waiting 22 seconds until the lettering starts to blink and pressing 'Enter' ('Enter' must be pressed before the lettering blinks for a second time at 24 seconds). Guitarist Huw Bunford has described this footage as being \"exactly how it looked on the tin ... noisy, full of testosterone, with pumped up guys in the woods trying to kill furry animals!\" ", "*Huw Bunford \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Sex, War & Robots\""]}, {"page": "Fuzzy Logic (Super Furry Animals album)", "response": ["*Huw Bunford \u2013 guitars, vocals, e-bow, cello, claps"]}, {"page": "Rings Around the World", "response": ["Rhys wrote many of the tracks on the album on acoustic guitar and piano and brought them to the band either as fully formed songs or as ideas which the group would then jam out. Ciaran wrote the songs \"[A] Touch Sensitive\" and \"Miniature\" and the intro and outro of \"Run! Christian, Run!\". A jam between Cian and guitarist Huw Bunford resulted in Rings Around the World's opening track \"Alternate Route to Vulcan Street\". The pair looped a sample of drummer Dafydd Ieuan playing the bass drum and snare and recorded themselves playing along on piano and guitar into a sampler. They then \"chopped the playing up a bit\" and filtered the drums and guitar to \"give them more movement\". Finally Rhys wrote lyrics and a string arrangement was added by Sean O'Hagan. Cian also contributed the second part of the song \"No Sympathy\", sampling the \"mellow acoustic guitars\" from the first half to create a techno \"climactic ending\".", "Paul McCartney is credited as providing \"celery and carrot\" on the track \"Receptacle for the Respectable\". McCartney is alleged to have performed a similar role over thirty years earlier, chewing celery to form the percussion track of The Beach Boys song \"Vegetables\" from the album Smiley Smile. The Super Furry Animals had met the ex-Beatle at the NME Awards when a drunk Ciaran persuaded him to let them remix some Beatles material, resulting in 2000's Liverpool Sound Collage album. The band asked him to \"return the favour\" and appear on Rings Around the World, recording his part over the phone. Huw Bunford has said of McCartney's contribution: \"He took it with good nature. You kind of see how far you can go sometimes ... we figured we already had a bass and singers so we really didn't need any more musicians. So we figured he could crunch vegetables\".  Former Velvet Underground member John Cale, a \"sort of childhood hero\" of Rhys's, also makes an appearance on the album, playing piano on the song \"Presidential Suite\". The Super Furry Animals had met Cale in Cardiff when they acted as his backing band for a song which appeared on the film Beautiful Mistake. They originally asked him to arrange strings for \"Presidential Suite\" but Cale turned them down reasoning that he would simply do what the band do: hum a melody to someone who could write the music down for him.", "In contrast with 1999's Guerrilla, which featured songs with \"self-consciously disposable, happy\" lyrics, the tracks on Rings Around the World are, according to Rhys, \"broodier and more revealing\". The track \"No Sympathy\" was originally written for a film entitled Plop, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week as though it were their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. \"Presidential Suite\", about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin, is \"a reflective look back at the decadent nineties\" during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if \"we need to know if he really came inside her mouth?\". \"Juxtapozed with U\" addresses social injustice and is about \"house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich\" and has been described by Rhys as \"grotesque in its upness and lift\". \"Sidewalk Serfer Girl\" was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. \"Receptacle for the Respectable\" is about simultaneously being in awe of, and being hurt by, a \"girl around town\" while \"It's Not the End of the World?\" is \"a romantic song about growing old\". \"Run! Christian, Run!\" was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford's interest in \"doomsday cult websites\". Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band's American tours. The album's title track, \"(Drawing) Rings Around the World\", is based on an idea put forward by Rhys' girlfriend's father and is about \"all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around\". \"Shoot Doris Day\" refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film\u2014\"a very cinematic reference\" for a song which Rhys claims is \"over-the-top lyrically\". The track is about \"how people change\" and also references Labour Party 'spin doctor' Peter Mandelson, in the guise of 'Victor Panache'.", "*Huw Bunford \u2013 lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, pedal steel"]}, {"page": "Guerrilla (album)", "response": ["During recording, the band used a sampler for the first time and hired many different musical instruments. The group experimented with electronic sounds and wrote several of the album's tracks in the studio, allowing \"the music to dictate itself\". The song \"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\" was written around the ringtone of a mobile phone with the rhythm track being based on a sample of bassist Guto Pryce tripping over a lead while Huw Bunford played a note on his guitar. \"Some Things Come from Nothing\" came from an acid house tune written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran. Samples of Rhys playing an out-of-tune acoustic guitar and Ciaran playing drums were mixed together and the song was \"written and recorded simultaneously\" by the group. \"The Sound of Life Today\" is a 22-second sample of \"Some Things Come From Nothing\" played backwards \u2013 an accident that occurred when mixing engineer Chris Shaw rewound the mix and forgot to mute the tape machine . According to Rhys the band gave the track a \"really pompous title\" so that listeners would expect to hear the meaning of life and instead get just a \"collection of noises\". \"Do or Die\", \"Fire in My Heart\" and \"Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy\" were written by Rhys while \"The Door to This House Remains Open\" developed from a band jam of the Rod Stewart song \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" which completely changed over the 30 minutes the group played for. The melody for \"Northern Lites\" was written by Gruff Rhys several years before the track was released. Reggae and rock styles were tried by the band before they settled on calypso after Rhys wrote lyrics for the song and tried playing along to a preset calypso rhythm track which was on his keyboard. The band added steel drums to the track on the spur of the moment after seeing the instruments \"lying around\" Real World during recording. The steel drums parts were performed by keyboard player Ciaran, despite the fact he did not know how to play them.", "Guerrilla features an eclectic mix of musical styles and has been described by Pitchfork as a combination of the group's techno roots and their more recent \"sunny guitar-pop\". The NME featured an interview with the Super Furry Animals, several weeks before the release of the album in the United Kingdom, as the lead article in an issue which discussed the \"nu-psychedelia\" musical genre, which they saw Guerrilla as exemplifying. Gruff Rhys has stated, however, that he sees the album as a quite conventional pop album, and that he associates psychedelia with improvisation whereas Guerrilla was \"almost entirely preconceived\". The singer has also said that the album is not a radical departure for the group musically, although it is \"more groovy and uptempo [...] more textured and punchy\" than the band's previous releases, partly due to the mix which creates a \"more American sound\". Spin stated that the record combines \"prog, glam, techno, and garage\" and is the \"gleeful missing link in the psych-prog continuum\". Select stated that the album juxtaposes pop songs with \"rambling odities\" and is dominated by the \"electronic throbs and pulses\" of keyboard player Cian Ciaran at the expense of guitarist Huw Bunford. The magazine went on to say that Gruff Rhys's voice anchors the record and gives life to songs which otherwise might seem to be works-in-progress, citing \"Chewing Chewing Gum\" as an example.", "According to Gruff Rhys, Guerrillas lyrics are largely \"self-consciously disposable, happy\". \"The Door to This House Remains Open\" is about \"starting a new chapter of your life\". Rhys has said that his lyrics, which suggest that people should leave their doors open to others and that international borders should be open to allow immigration, are so optimistic that he is almost embarrassed by them. In contrast \"Some Things Come From Nothing\" features pessimistic lyrics inspired by the idea that \"nothing seems to have any substance any more\". \"The Teacher\" was written by Rhys from a teacher's perspective and was inspired by guitarist Huw Bunford, who was an art teacher before the Super Furry Animals became successful. Although Rhys has stated that \"Fire in My Heart\" features the most clich\u00e9d lyrics he has ever written, he has also said that he wrote it with complete sincerity. The track is \"soul advice\" and is about the many different people in our lives.", "The album features the hidden tracks \"Citizen's Band\" and \"Chewing Chewing Gum (Reprise)\". The former appears only on the Compact Disc version of the record\u2014it is stored in the pregap and can be heard by rewinding back from the start of the first song, \"Check It Out\". The latter appears at the very end of the album following several minutes of silence after the end of last song \"Keep the Cosmic Trigger Happy\". The lyrics for \"Citizen's Band\" are hidden inside the card outer-sleeve included with original CD copies of the album. According to Rhys the band decided to hide \"Citizen's Band\" as it didn't fit with the rest of the Guerrilla and they wanted to make the album like a computer game which can be played for several months before a new level is discovered. Guitarist Huw Bunford has stated that the band originally intended to hide the track in the album cover itself, by way of a special vinyl sleeve design, but the group's record label, Creation, refused to allow this due to the cost.", "*Huw Bunford \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals, samplers"]}, {"page": "Phantom Phorce", "response": ["*Huw Bunford \u2013 Lead guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Mwng", "response": ["*Huw Bunford \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Love Kraft", "response": ["The album represented a departure from the band's previous working methods: although all five members had always contributed to the development of the songs, Gruff Rhys had been the main songwriter. On Love Kraft this was no longer the case, as Rhys, Huw Bunford, Dafydd Ieuan and Cian Ciaran all contributed songs and lead vocals. The group also abandoned their usual practise of picking songs on their individual merit, instead choosing tracks that would work well together and \"create a sound that was as cohesive as possible\". Of the \"30-40\" songs written by band members the group chose \"the more introspective ones\" which meant that some of Rhys's tracks were left off the album as they were \"energetic and poppy\" and \"didn't really fit in with everybody else's work\".", "Several 'found sounds' were recorded and used on the album including the buzzing of a Brazilian electrical substation, the sound of pool balls being rubbed against each other and a recording of Huw Bunford jumping into a swimming pool.

In contrast with many Super Furry Animals albums, no samplers were used during recording of Hey Venus! as the group made a conscious decision to create a \"simple record\" which \"capture[d] the spirit of the band playing live in a room\". Dave Newfeld took over production duties from Mario Caldato Jr., who had worked on both Phantom Power and Love Kraft, as the band didn't want to \"repeat [their] past two records\". As with Love Kraft, all members of the band contributed songs at the recording stage but, besides chief songwriter Gruff Rhys, only guitarist Huw Bunford (\"Battersea Odyssey\") and keyboard player Cian Ciaran (\"Carbon Dating\") ended up with their tracks on the finished album.", "As with Love Kraft Rhys was not the sole writer; guitarist Huw Bunford wrote \"Battersea Odyssey\" (inspired by Battersea Power Station), while keyboard player Cian Ciaran wrote \"Carbon Dating\". Other members of the band contributed songs that do not appear on Hey Venus! but might \"end up on the next record\". Newfeld also encouraged the group to improvise songs, two of which, \"Semi Pro\" and \"Hot Nutz\", appear briefly on footage of the recording process streamed at the band's website and included with American editions of the album. Rhys claimed these tracks (along with 32 other improvised songs recorded during the Hey Venus! sessions) would \"probably never be released\" but give \"a glimpse into the magic of the Super Furry Animals in the studio, and the kind of atmosphere that Dave created\". However, \"Hot Nutz\" was reworked as \"Moped Eyes\" for their next album, Dark Days/Light Years.", "Some of the songs recorded barely resemble their earlier demo versions including \"Baby Ate My Eightball\", which originally \"had this sort of Miami based rhythm with babies crying and glasses smashing\" and was \"very abrasive\". The finished track (which features Huw Bunford \"impersonating a police or ambulance siren with the backing vocals\") was mixed three or four times and \"barely resembles the original\".", "Rhys has claimed to be particularly pleased with \"Into the Night\" (which \"was kind of where my head was at, which is quite a ridiculous place to be\") and \"Carbon Dating\" (\"probably the most beautiful song on the record\") while Huw Bunford has described the album as \"one of [the] best records we've ever made\".", "The story of the Venus character helped the band give something to Tanaami that he \"could read and maybe translate into a visual representation\". After hearing the album the artist came up with something \"quite mental\" according to Huw Bunford, who went on to state \"it's amazing what he obviously heard in the music\".", "The track \"Run-Away\" was singled out for praise by several publications with the Independent on Sunday calling the song \"outstanding\",  Culture Deluxe claiming the track showed the Super Furries at \"their pop-best\" and proved they \"could do no wrong\" and the NME stating that \"with a chorus as big as guitarist Huw Bunford's new serial-killer beard, it's up there with the most finely polished weapons in the SFA armoury\".  \"Baby Ate My Eightball\" received some criticism, with The Independent claiming that it \"falls short of expectations, its limp disco groove providing uncertain footing for Rhys's rococo confection of harmonies\" and Uncut stating that the song, along with \"Neo Consumer\", doesn't \"tell us anything we didn't already know\" about the band.", "The band decided to keep the Hey Venus! tour simple as the elaborate stage designs and costumes used on previous tours tended to wipe out any profits created, resulting in \"financial melt-down\" for the group in 2006. Huw Bunford told a Times journalist in August 2007 that the tour would be \"like that bit at the end of the Mike Yarwood shows where he said, 'And this is me', no gim-micks.
