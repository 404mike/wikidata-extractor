In this paper, Hill's first publication, he derived both the equilibrium form of the Langmuir equation, and also the exponential approach to equilibrium. The paper, written under the supervision of John Newport Langley, is a landmark in the history of receptor theory, because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the \"receptive substance\" at the neuromuscular junction."]}, {"page": "West Berkshire", "response": ["*John Newport Langley (1852\u20131925), scientist"]}, {"page": "Charles Scott Sherrington", "response": ["In October 1879, Sherrington entered Cambridge as a non-collegiate student.

He studied medicine at Heidelberg, Munich and Berlin, graduating in 1925.  In the same year he moved with his new wife to England and studied first under John Newport Langley at Cambridge and then Henry Dale at Hampstead.  In 1927 he returned to the Physiological Institute in Berlin but he was dismissed in 1933 during the Nazi purge of Jewish scientists. With the aid of Archibald Hill's Academic Assistance Council, Feldberg was relocated to Britain's National Institute for Medical Research in 1934\u201336. Here, he worked with Henry Hallett Dale, providing a significant impetus for Dale's Nobel Prize winning research into chemical neurotransmission. Feldberg was subsequently offered a place in Australia, at the behest of Charles Kellaway, director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He spent two years (1936\u201338) in Melbourne, joining Kellaway's snake venom research programme. This work developed into a study of tissue responses to direct and indirect insult, focusing particularly on the liberation of histamine and other endogenous mediators. A finding of lasting pharmacological interest from these studies was the identification and partial isolation of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. Although Feldberg had earned a fellowship supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, in 1938 he was offered a readership in physiology at Cambridge University. He returned to England to take up this post, remaining there throughout World War II until 1949. Feldberg's subsequent appointments include: Head of Physiology and Pharmacology Division, National Institute for Medical Research, London, 1949\u201365 (Honorary Head of Division, 1965\u201366); Head, Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, National Institute for Medical Research, 1966\u201374.

His technique was used by Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron. Golgi and Ram\u00f3n y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. The hypotheses of the neuron doctrine were supported by experiments following Galvani's pioneering work in the electrical excitability  of muscles and neurons. In 1898, British scientist John Newport Langley first coined the term \"autonomic\" in classifying the connections of nerve fibers to peripheral nerve cells. Langley is known as one of the fathers of the chemical receptor theory, and as the origin of the concept of \"receptive substance\". Towards the end of the nineteenth century Francis Gotch conducted several experiments on nervous system function. In 1899 he described the \"inexcitable\" or \"refractory phase\" that takes place between nerve impulses. His primary focus was on how nerve interaction affected the muscles and eyes."]}, {"page": "Receptor theory", "response": ["Receptor theory is the application of receptor models to explain drug behavior. Pharmacological receptor models preceded accurate knowledge of receptors by many years. John Newport Langley and Paul Ehrlich introduced the concept of a receptor that would mediate drug action at the beginning of the 20th century.

So far, nearly all of the quantitative theoretical modelling of receptor function has centred on ligand-gated ion channels and GPCRs."]}, {"page": "Marc Tiffeneau", "response": ["* Le syst\u00e8me nerveux autonome sympathique et parasympathique, 1923; (translation of John Newport Langley)."]}, {"page": "The Journal of Physiology", "response": ["The Journal of Physiology was first published  in 1878 and edited by Michael Foster.

The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Sch\u00e4fer's presentation: \u2033Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. ... I find that even after ... complete denervation, whether of three days\u2019 or ten months\u2019 duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. ... The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.\u2033 The abstract is the \u2033birth certificate\u2033 of chemical neurotransmission.L.

Langley stated that his choice of autonomic was not intended to imply a special degree of independence for the cells at hand, but rather to demarcate a clear departure from previous nomenclature because his hypothesis, while incorporating much previous research, was largely distinct from his predecessors."]}]}}
