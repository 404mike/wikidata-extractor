The next day young defender Matt Partridge was the first player to depart during the month, joining Bognor Regis Town on a one-month loan.", "In a quiet month of loan activity young goalkeeper Jon Henly was the only outgoing player, joining Hungerford Town on 14 December on a one-month deal. On 17 December Reading were back at the Madejski Stadium to face Arsenal in what turned out to be another high scoring game between the two sides. The visitors took a 4\u20130 lead through Lukas Podolski and a Santi Cazorla hat-trick before the Royals gave themselves a lifeline with two quick goals from Le Fondre and Jimmy K\u00e9b\u00e9. Any hopes of a comeback were dashed after 80 minutes though when Theo Walcott scored Arsenal's fifth as the game finished 5\u20132. The following weekend Reading were away to Manchester City and despite putting in a much improved performance, they were beaten 1\u20130. The Royals held out for 93 minutes until Gareth Barry rose above Nicky Shorey to head past Adam Federici and snatch victory. Boxing day saw the visit of Swansea City with a 0\u20130 draw enough to end a run of seven straight defeats. Adam Le Fondre had a second half goal disallowed for handball though they created few other chances with Federici forced to pull off a number of saves to keep Swansea from scoring. On the same day Matt Partridge returned from his loan spell at Bognor Regis Town having spent two months with the Rocks. The last game of the month saw Reading clinch a vital 1\u20130 win over West Ham United at the Madejski. A mistake from James Collins allowed Pavel Pogrebnyak to score after just five minutes and the Royals held on for just their second win of the season. Despite a good end to the month, the team managed just four points from a possible 21 and remained in 19th place going into the new year. The year ended with the return of Simon Church from his loan spell at Huddersfield having been with the Yorkshire side since early November.", "| Matt Partridge", "| Matt Partridge", "| Matt Partridge"]}, {"page": "Reading F.C.
