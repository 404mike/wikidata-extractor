He was ranked as the greatest player ever in Spurs history by The Times in 2009.Blanchflower played as a defensive midfielder at right half and was known particularly for his accurate passing, his ability to dictate the tempo of the game and his inspiring leadership. After a lengthy playing career, he retired at the age of 38 and became a respected football journalist, and later a football manager.\nHe made one of the best known quotes on football: \"The great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning. It is nothing of the kind. The game is about glory, it is about doing things in style and with a flourish, about going out and beating the lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Belfast", "response": ["* Danny Blanchflower, football player and manager"]}, {"page": "December 9", "response": ["*1993 \u2013 Danny Blanchflower, Northern Irish footballer and manager (b. 1926)"]}, {"page": "February 10", "response": ["*  1926   \u2013 Danny Blanchflower, Northern Irish soldier, footballer and manager (d. 1993)"]}, {"page": "Geoff Hurst", "response": ["Hurst joined Chelsea, then in the Second Division, before the 1979\u201380 season, initially as assistant manager to Danny Blanchflower.

The quote, \"If he's not interfering with play, what's he doing on the pitch?\" has been attributed to Bill Nicholson and Danny Blanchflower.  In an effort to avoid such criticisms, which were based on the fact that phrases such as \"interfering with play\", \"interfering with an opponent\", and \"gaining an advantage\" were not clearly defined, FIFA issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003; and these were incorporated into Law 11 in July 2005. The new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely, but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent. In response to these requests, IFAB circular 3 was issued in 2015 to provide additional guidance on the criteria for interfering with an opponent. This additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law, and forms the last 3 conditions under the heading \"Interfering with an opponent\" as shown above.
