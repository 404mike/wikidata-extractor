He was ranked as the greatest player ever in Spurs history by The Times in 2009.Blanchflower played as a defensive midfielder at right half and was known particularly for his accurate passing, his ability to dictate the tempo of the game and his inspiring leadership. After a lengthy playing career, he retired at the age of 38 and became a respected football journalist, and later a football manager.\nHe made one of the best known quotes on football: \"The great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning. It is nothing of the kind. The game is about glory, it is about doing things in style and with a flourish, about going out and beating the lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
