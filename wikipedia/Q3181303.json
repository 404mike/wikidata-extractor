During the war he was nicknamed \"Cat's Eyes\" by the British press to explain his successes and to avoid communicating the existence of airborne radar to the enemy.\nCunningham was born in Croydon, and as a teenager was keen on entering the aviation industry. Temporarily abiding by his father's wishes for him to avoid the military, he approached the de Havilland company and was accepted as an engineering candidate. Concurrently, he joined the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and became a member of No. 604 (County of Middlesex) Squadron. Cunningham began his training in August 1935, flew solo in March 1936 and received his wings in 1937. He gradually became an established test pilot, gaining considerable flying time on different types of aircraft.\nIn August 1939 Cunningham rejoined his squadron, now equipped with a version of the Bristol Blenheim. His observer was Jimmy Rawnsley, who would serve as his gunner and radio operator for most of the war and contribute to all but three of his victories. In July 1940 the squadron was re-designated as a specialised night fighter unit and was amongst the first to receive airborne interception radar (AI). Cunningham was promoted to squadron leader in September 1940.\nOn the night of the 19 November 1940, Cunningham claimed his first victory. By the time the Blitz had ended in June 1941, he had destroyed 13 enemy aircraft and claimed three as probable victories, and two damaged. After a prolonged rest period, he was promoted to wing commander in 1942. He was also appointed to command No. 85 Squadron RAF, by which time his tally had reached 16 enemy aircraft destroyed. In 1943 and early 1944 he added a further four victories, one probable and one damaged. Cunningham's combat career ended with 20 aerial victories, three probable and six damaged. He spent the remainder of the conflict in various staff officer positions. By the end of the war in Europe in May 1945 he had attained the rank of group captain.\nAfter the war Cunningham rejoined de Havilland and continued his test-pilot career. He flew the world's first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, in 1949. He then flew commercial jets for a time in the early 1960s and continued flying in the industry until the late 1970s. He also worked for British Aerospace as executive director, retiring in 1980. In recognition of his wartime exploits and his contribution to civil aviation he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "De Havilland Mosquito", "response": ["In February 1941, buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some  behind the wing's trailing edge; this meant the flaps had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections.Bowman 2005, p. 19. With the buffeting problems largely resolved, John Cunningham flew W4050 on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the \"lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics\". Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it might replace the Bristol Beaufighter night fighter.", "The Mosquito also proved a very capable night fighter. Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew these variants. For example, Wing Commander Branse Burbridge claimed 21 kills, and Wing Commander John Cunningham claimed 19 of his 20 victories at night on Mosquitos."]}, {"page": "East of England", "response": ["Glues for the Mosquito wooden airframe were developed by Norman de Bruyne at his Duxford-based Aero Research Limited, which invented Araldite; the site is now owned by Hexcel. The Mosquito fuselage was made from two-halves of balsa wood (Ochroma) from Ecuador, and Canadian Birch, which had a madapollam fabric over the surface; the wings were made from plywood and spruce. De Havilland built the Comet (the world's first jet airliner, first flying in July 1949 when piloted by John Cunningham, powered by DH jet engines, and designed by R.E. Bishop) at Hatfield, and built the Blue Streak rocket launcher at its Stevenage base; by the end of WWII the DH Goblin, designed by Frank Halford, was the world's most powerful jet engine. Ball bearings for the Merlin engine came from Hoffman of Chelmsford; its former site is now the Rivermead university campus."]}, {"page": "The Blitz", "response": ["Nevertheless, it was radar that proved to be the critical weapon in the night battles over Britain from this point onward. Dowding had introduced the concept of airborne radar and encouraged its usage. Eventually, it would become a success. On the night of 22/23 July, 1940, Flying Officer Cyril Ashfield (pilot), Pilot Officer Geoffrey Morris (air observer) and Flight Sergeant Reginald Leyland (Air Intercept radar operator) of the Fighter Interception Unit became the first pilot and crew to intercept and destroy an enemy aircraft using onboard radar to guide them to a visual interception, when their AI night fighter brought down a Do 17 off Sussex.White 2007, pp. 50\u201351. On 19 November 1940 the famous RAF night fighter ace John Cunningham shot down a Ju 88 bomber using airborne radar, just as Dowding had predicted.Holland 2007, pp. 602\u201303. By mid-November, nine squadrons were available, but only one was equipped with Beaufighters (No. 219 Squadron RAF at RAF Kenley). By 16 February 1941, this had grown to 12; with 5 equipped, or partially equipped with Beaufighters spread over 5 Groups.Ray 1996, p. 189.", "Improved aircraft designs were in the offing with the Bristol Beaufighter, then under development. It would prove formidable but its development was slow. The Beaufighter had a maximum speed of , an operational ceiling of , a climb rate of  per minute, and its battery of four  Hispano cannon and six .303\u00a0in Browning machine guns was much more lethal.Mackay 2003, p. 93. On 19 November, John Cunningham of No. 604 Squadron RAF shot down a bomber flying an AI-equipped Beaufighter, the first air victory for the airborne radar. In November and December 1940, the  flew 9,000 sorties against British targets and RAF night fighters claimed only six shot down. In January 1941, Fighter Command flew 486 sorties against 1,965 made by the Germans. Just three and twelve were claimed by the RAF and AA defences respectively.Ray 1996, p. 190. In the bad weather of February 1941, Fighter Command flew 568 sorties to counter the  which flew 1,644 sorties. Night fighters could claim only four bombers for four losses.Ray 1996, p. 191."]}, {"page": "De Havilland Comet", "response": ["The inquiry's recommendations revolved around the enforcement of stricter speed limits during turbulence, and two significant design changes also resulted: all Comets were equipped with weather radar and the \"Q feel\" system was introduced, which ensured that control column forces (invariably called stick forces) would be proportional to control loads. This artificial feel was the first of its kind to be introduced in any aircraft. The Comet 1 and 1A had been criticised for a lack of \"feel\" in their controls,Job 1996, p. 14. and investigators suggested that this might have contributed to the pilot's alleged over-stressing of the aircraft;Darling 2001, p. 26. Comet chief test pilot John Cunningham contended that the jetliner flew smoothly and was highly responsive in a manner consistent with other de Havilland aircraft.Faith 1996, pp. 63\u201364.", "According to de Havilland's chief test pilot John Cunningham, who had flown the prototype's first flight, representatives from American manufacturers such as Boeing and Douglas privately disclosed that if de Havilland had not experienced the Comet's pressurisation problems first, it would have happened to them.Faith 1996, p. 72. Cunningham likened the Comet to the later Concorde and added that he had assumed that the aircraft would change aviation, which it subsequently did. Aviation author Bill Withuhn concluded that the Comet had pushed \"'the state-of-the-art' beyond its limits.\"Withuhn 1976, p. 88.", "The Comet 3, which flew for the first time on 19 July 1954, was a Comet 2 lengthened by  and powered by Avon M502 engines developing . The variant added wing pinion tanks, and offered greater capacity and range.Jackson 1987, p. 457. The Comet 3 was destined to remain a development series since it did not incorporate the fuselage-strengthening modifications of the later series aircraft, and was not able to be fully pressurised.Birtles 1970, p. 129. Only two Comet 3s began construction; G-ANLO, the only airworthy Comet 3, was demonstrated at the Farnborough SBAC Show in September 1954. The other Comet 3 airframe was not completed to production standard and was used primarily for ground-based structural and technology testing during development of the similarly sized Comet 4. Another nine Comet 3 airframes were not completed and their construction was abandoned at Hatfield.Walker 2000, pp. 51\u201352. In BOAC colours, G-ANLO was flown by John Cunningham in a marathon round-the-world promotional tour in December 1955. As a flying testbed, it was later modified with Avon RA29 engines fitted, as well as replacing the original long-span wings with reduced span wings as the Comet 3B and demonstrated in British European Airways (BEA) livery at the Farnborough Airshow in September 1958. Assigned in 1961 to the Blind Landing Experimental Unit (BLEU) at RAE Bedford, the final testbed role played by G\u2013ANLO was in automatic landing system experiments. When retired in 1973, the airframe was used for foam-arrester trials before the fuselage was salvaged at BAE Woodford, to serve as the mock-up for the Nimrod.Davies and Birtles 1999, p. 36."]}, {"page": "De Havilland", "response": ["* John Cunningham (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "De Havilland Vampire", "response": ["On 23 March 1948, John Cunningham, flying a modified Vampire Mk I with extended wing tips and powered by the Ghost engine, achieved a new world altitude record of 59,446\u00a0ft (18,119\u00a0m)."]}, {"page": "John Cunningham", "response": ["*John Cunningham (Australian footballer) (born 1974), Geelong, Norwood and Port Melbourne player", "*John Cunningham (cricketer) (1854\u20131932), New Zealand cricketer", "*John Cunningham (Gaelic footballer), played for Donegal", "*John Cunningham (Northern Ireland footballer), football coach and former football player", "*John Cunningham (rugby league) (born 1952), English rugby league footballer of the 1970s, for England, and Barrow", "*John Cunningham (Scottish footballer) (1868\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*John Cunningham (baseball) (1892\u2013?), Negro leagues shortstop", "*John Cunningham (bishop) (born 1938), Roman Catholic bishop of Galloway, Scotland", "*John Cunningham (moderator) (1819\u20131893), General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1886", "* John Cunningham (officer), Anglo-Irish soldier at the Siege of Derry", "*John Cunningham (RAF officer) (1917\u20132002), Group Captain, RAF Night fighter Ace", "*John Cunningham (VC 1916) (1897\u20131941), East Yorkshire Regiment", "*John Cunningham (VC 1917) (1890\u20131917), Prince of Wales's Leinster Regiment", "*John Cunningham (Royal Navy officer) (1885\u20131962), RN, First Sea Lord", "*John Cunningham, 15th Earl of Glencairn (1749\u20131796), Scottish nobleman, cavalry officer, and priest", "*John Cunningham (Australian politician) (1867\u20131949), Australian politician in Western Australia", "*John Cunningham (Nova Scotia judge), judge and politician in Nova Scotia", "*John Cunningham (Nova Scotia politician) (1776\u20131847), farmer, official and politician in Nova Scotia", "*Sir John Cunningham, 1st Baronet (died 1684), member of the Parliament of Scotland", "*John Cunningham (poet and dramatist) (1729\u20131773), Irish pastoral poet and dramatist", "*John Cunningham (journalist) (1945\u20132012), Irish newspaper editor", "*John Cunningham (Sorcerer) aka Doctor Fian, executed in 1591 for sorcery in the North Berwick witch trials", "*John Cunningham (explorer) (c. 1575\u20131651), Scottish explorer for Denmark", "*John Cunningham (architect) (1799\u20131873), Scottish architect", "*John Cunningham (Irish criminal), Irish kidnapper and illicit drug smuggler", "*John Cunningham (physician) (born 1949), physician to the Queen of the United Kingdom", "*John Cunninghame, Lord Cunninghame (1782\u20131854), Scottish judge", "*Human polyomavirus 2, referred as John Cunningham virus"]}, {"page": "1948 in aviation", "response": ["* March 23 \u2013 Group Captain John Cunningham sets a new world altitude record of 59,446\u00a0ft (18,119 m) in a de Havilland Vampire."]}, {"page": "British Aerospace 125", "response": ["*On 20 November 1975, a British Aerospace BAe 125 overran the runway at Dunsfold Aerodrome after a bird strike on takeoff.
