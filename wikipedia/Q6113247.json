His average rose from around 15 to over 21 runs per wicket, and he was rarely as successful as before when the ground helped him or against weak batting - though his work rate still earned him many wickets. In early 1936, Freeman was again strong, and he took 70 wickets in the first fourteen matches.  But his performance deteriorated thereafter, with only 33 wickets in the next fourteen games, so that Kent did not engage him for 1937. Freeman played for Walsall in the Birmingham And District League for a few years after that. He was granted life membership of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1949. After retirement Freeman opened a chain of sports retail shops in partnership with his old Kent team mate Jack Hubble. He christened his retirement cottage \"Dunbowlin'\"."]}, {"page": "Fred Huish", "response": ["Huish repeated this feat in 1913 and, as of November 2017, remains the record holder for most dismissals in a career for Kent with a total of 1,254 dismissals in 469 matches.
