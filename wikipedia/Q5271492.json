In May 2018, Doctors aired another themed week, based around mental health. The transmission dates coincided with Mental Health Awareness Week. Writer Andrew Cornish felt that due to the seriousness of the topic, it felt \"counter-productive and unrealistic\" to \"drop\" regular characters into numerous mental health-related storylines for that one week, so he planned to have several storylines come to a head in the week. These included Rob Hollins' (Chris Walker) PTSD and Al Haskey's (Ian Midlane) struggle with the diagnosis of his mother's dementia. In November 2019, it was confirmed via Twitter that Doctors were filming for the 20th anniversary episode. As part of the celebrations for the milestone, Julia Parsons (Diane Keen) briefly returned to the series. It was also revealed that every regular cast member in the series will be featured in a scene together. To celebrate the 20th year of Doctors, a competition was opened for viewers to visit the set at BBC Drama Village on 18 March 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the set tour was postponed, and it was later announced that filming of Doctors had been postponed due to the virus. On 26 March 2020, a 60-minute episode titled \"A Day in the Life...\" was broadcast, which saw the conclusion of a long-running prison storyline involving Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan), and a documentary being made about The Mill. Also in March 2020, an episode starring Joe Pasquale was broadcast. The episode, titled \"The Joe Pasquale Problem\", displays patient Lizzie Milton (Adele James) suffering from the Fregoli delusion, seeing everyone as Pasquale. Beth Maloney of Entertainment Daily described the episode as \"bizarre\" but \"amazing\".", "Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young as the original executive producer. When the series premiered, BBC's head of daytime programming felt that commissioning the series was an ambitious move. She opined that the series offered something new and that viewers would not realise they would want a series like Doctors until they had seen it. Lush noted that despite its serial element, the premise of the soap meant that people could \"dip in and out\" since the core cast stays the same and the episodes are self-contained. Young echoed Lush's comments and said that he had wanted to create a daytime drama series for years prior to his involvement with Doctors. Young felt that the previously unfilled daytime slot would be good for the series due to more people beginning to work from home in 2000. Doctors was originally shown at 12:30\u00a0pm as a lead-in to BBC News at One. For a brief trial period in mid-2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7:00\u00a0pm, but due to rival soap Emmerdale being transmitted at the same time, Doctors suffered from low ratings, and was trialled in a 2:10\u00a0pm time slot instead. The series later moved into its current timeslot of 1:45\u00a0pm in 2008. Cast member Diane Keen opined that Doctors should be broadcast in a primetime slot. Controller of BBC Daytime scheduled Liam Keelan commented: \"its true home will always be as a hugely appreciated early afternoon drama\". In a 2010 review of BBC continuing dramas, it was reported by Digital Spy that Doctors regularly won the largest share in its time slot, and attracted consistent audience numbers, with an average of 2 million viewers per episode. In 2020, executive producer Mike Hobson was asked by Allison Jones of Inside Soap if he would consider a late-night time slot, to which he commented: \"for our audience, we sit quite nicely\". He felt that if the soap was shown at nighttime, producers would \"still tackle all the powerful subject matters [they do now], and that seeing more sexual or swearing scenes would not add to the quality of the programme\".", "The storylines originally dealt with the lives of staff and patients at the fictional Riverside Health Centre and its secondary location, the Best Practice. During the early years, many storylines revolved around the lead character of Mac and his family life. These storylines include his romance with Julia Parsons (Diane Keen) and his son, Liam McGuire (Tim Matthews), facing a sexual assault allegation. In 2007, when more episodes were shown and there were fewer breaks in transmission, storylines included: receptionist Donna Parmar (Martha Howe Douglas) breaking patient confidentiality and her sacking from the Mill (2007), Nick West's (Michael McKell) car crash and later death (2008) and receptionist Vivien March's (Anita Carey) rape in 2008. 2009 also saw the departure of longstanding family unit Ronnie (Se\u00e1n Gleeson), George (Stirling Gallacher) and Bracken Woodson (Jessica Gallagher)."]}, {"page": "Empress Elisabeth of Austria", "response": ["Elisabeth was portrayed in episode 1 of the 1974 British television series Fall of Eagles.
