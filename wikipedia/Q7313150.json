He commended the final essay for its \"valuable transposition into a more accessible medium of some of the central Platonic insights\", while noting that some aspects of Murdoch's interpretation of Plato could be questioned. In Philosophy in 1972,  H.O. Mounce agreed with Murdoch's criticisms of the prevailing views in moral philosophy at the time, but had reservations about her use of Simone Weil's concept of attention and her view of the connection between goodness and knowledge. He recommended the book as \"one of the most interesting books on ethics to have appeared for a number of years\", mainly because of its \"freshness\"."]}]}}
