In April 1999, Leng played for Yorkshire Bank first team in the Bradford Cricket League, the first woman to play in that league, and became the first woman to play inter UCCE cricket in 2001. She was dropped from England's one-day squad in 2002 after taking an unauthorized holiday in Tenerife. Although she was recalled for the 2003 tour of Australia, her last Test match was in February 2003. Her highest Test score came in 1996, with 144 against New Zealand, which is the record for the highest individual score by any cricketer when batting at number 7 position or lower in Women's Test history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England women's cricket team", "response": ["| 10 || Kathryn Leng || 144 || 229 || 15 || 0 || New Zealand || 24 June 1996"]}, {"page": "Batting order (cricket)", "response": ["# Kathryn Leng (ENG): 144 vs. Australia at Scarborough, 1996"]}, {"page": "Bradford Premier League", "response": ["In April 1999, Kathryn Leng became the first woman to play in the Bradford League, representing the former Yorkshire Bank club."]}, {"page": "Lisa Sthalekar", "response": ["Sthalekar was retained for the Second Test at Bankstown Oval in her home town Sydney, but after her failure as an opener in the preceding match, she returned to her conventional position in the middle-order. In the restructuring in the batting line-up, Kris Britt was called in to make her Test debut as an opener alongside Clark, and middle-order batsman Michelle Goszko was omitted to accommodate Sthalekar. Australia batted first and collapsed to be 3/25, bringing Sthalekar in to join Mel Jones. Sthalekar made 18 from 94 balls, combining with Jones for a 65-run partnership in 99 minutes to steady the innings. She was then dismissed by Pearson, triggering an Australian collapsed to 134 all out, losing their last seven wickets for 44 runs. She then took 0/21 and ran out Kathryn Leng with a throw to Price as the tourists took a 53-run lead. However, Australia's top-order again capitulated, and Sthalekar came to the crease at 3/36; the score then became 4/49 when Jones fell. Sthalekar then combined with Alex Blackwell to take Australia out of trouble, putting on 136 for the fifth wicket before the latter fell for 58. Sthalekar ended with an unbeaten 120, including four fours, from six hours of batting, as Australia declared at 7/259. Sthalekar then took 1/26 from 18 overs, removing Leng lbw, as England ended the match at 6/133 to avoid a defeat."]}, {"page": "Woodhouse Grove School", "response": ["* Kathryn Leng (1985\u2013), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Sarah Collyer", "response": ["In 2002, Collyer and Kathryn Leng were temporarily removed from the side when they went on \"an unauthorised holiday to Tenerife\"."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Women cricket team", "response": ["Yorkshire joined the Women's County Championship for its inaugural season in 1997, and won five of the first six titles, their run only interrupted by East Midlands in 1999.
