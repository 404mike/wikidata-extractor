In 1955, Hickling was posted to Malaya (now Malaysia), where he gained prominence as a lawmaker. He drafted the Constitution of Malaysia, and as Commissioner of Law Revision wrote the Internal Security Act (ISA) of 1960, which provided for the detention of persons without trial. The ISA was later used to suppress political opponents or those dedicated to non-violent activities, which Hickling later said was not his intention.\nIn 1972, Hickling retired from the civil service, and subsequently lectured in law in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Hickling later wrote many books and law journal articles, and also wrote novels and short stories throughout his career. Hickling died in 2007 in Malvern, Worcestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1920 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 August \u2013 Hugh Hickling, lawyer, colonial civil servant (died 2007)"]}, {"page": "Internal Security Act (Singapore)", "response": ["The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling, a British lawyer, author and professor.

Nonetheless, he commented that he supported review of the ISA but it was not for him to say if the law should be scrapped, as \"you've got a multi-racial society [in Malaysia] in which emotions can run high very quickly\".."]}, {"page": "R.
