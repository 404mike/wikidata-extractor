Born in Rhymney, near Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales, he became a poet, originally writing in Welsh, but later writing exclusively in English.\nHe was the only poet to cover significant events of the early 20th century in the South Wales Valleys and the South Wales Coalfield, and from a perspective literally at the coalface. He is now best known for the verses \"Bells of Rhymney\", from his 1938 Gwalia Deserta (meaning literally \"Wasteland of Wales\"), which were later adapted into a popular folk song.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 6", "response": ["*1953 \u2013 Idris Davies, Welsh poet and author (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Idris Davies (1905\u20131953, W)"]}, {"page": "Glasnevin Cemetery", "response": ["Glasnevin Cemetery is the setting for the \"Hades\" episode in James Joyce's 1922 novel Ulysses, and is mentioned by Idris Davies in his poem Eire."]}, {"page": "1926 United Kingdom general strike", "response": ["* The failure of the strike inspired Idris Davies to write \"Bells of Rhymney\" (published 1938), which Pete Seeger made into the song \"The Bells of Rhymney\" (recorded 1958)."]}, {"page": "The Byrds", "response": ["The Mr. Tambourine Man album followed on June 21, 1965, peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and number 7 on the UK Albums Chart.

In particular, Clark's \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\" has gone on to become a rock music standard, with many critics considering it one of the band's and Clark's best songs.  Upon release, the Mr. Tambourine Man album, like the single of the same name, was influential in popularizing folk rock and served to establish the band as an internationally successful rock act, representing the first effective American challenge to the dominance of the Beatles and the British Invasion."]}, {"page": "Pete Seeger", "response": ["To earn money during the blacklist period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger worked gigs as a music teacher in schools and summer camps, and traveled the college campus circuit. He also recorded as many as five albums a year for Moe Asch's Folkways Records label. As the nuclear disarmament movement picked up steam in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger's anti-war songs, such as \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\" (co-written with Joe Hickerson), \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" adapted from the Book of Ecclesiastes, and \"The Bells of Rhymney\" by the Welsh poet Idris Davies (1957), gained wide currency. Seeger was the first person to make a studio recording of \"Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream\" in 1956. Seeger also was closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement and in 1963 helped organize a landmark Carnegie Hall concert, featuring the youthful Freedom Singers, as a benefit for the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. This event, and Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in August of that same year, brought the civil rights anthem \"We Shall Overcome\" to wide audiences.  He sang it on the 50-mile walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, along with 1,000 other marchers.Whitehead, John. \"Pete Seeger: Changing the World One Song at a Time.\" Waxahachie Daily Light.
