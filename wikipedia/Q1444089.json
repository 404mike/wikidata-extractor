Britain remained under World War II rationing and was short of cooking oils and fats, and especially margarine. He presented the idea to John Strachey, the Minister of Food, and in April 1946, the British government authorised a mission to visit suitable sites, led by John Wakefield, former Director of Agriculture in Tanganyika.

But it was not until the war ended that concrete steps were taken to kick start such a project. Market leaders in the sector were all imported brands with the absence of a locally produced beer. UAC did not have a technical history in beer-making, leading the firm to enter into a technical agreement with Heineken and investments from other merchandise companies in Nigeria including John Holt, GBO, SCOA, CFAO and UTC who all took some equity interest in the new company. Nigerian Breweries was incorporated in 1946."]}, {"page": "USS Montauk (1862)", "response": ["She was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1865. She remained there until sold to Frank Samuel on April 14, 1904, except for a stint from May 1898 to March 1899, when she served with a crew primarily consisting of local naval reservists to protect the harbor of Portland, Maine during the Spanish\u2013American War."]}, {"page": "STAR Lager", "response": ["After the end of World War II, UAC under the leadership of Frank Samuel promoted the establishment of a beer company in Nigeria. In November 1946, UAC in partnership with Heineken established Nigerian Breweries Ltd. In June 1949, STAR lager was introduced into the Nigerian market. The newly introduced Nigerian beer brand with white bubbling foam faced some risk as it was in competition with foreign beer brands, whiskey and palm wine. Star beer gained market ground and in 1960 was the market leader and recognizable at parties and ceremonies."]}]}}
