Ewan McGregor was cast after impressing Boyle and Macdonald with his work on their previous film, Shallow Grave. According to Boyle, for the role of Renton, they wanted the quality of Michael Caine's character in Alfie and Malcolm McDowell's character in A Clockwork Orange, \"repulsive ... with charm \"that makes you feel deeply ambiguous about what he's doing.\" McGregor shaved his head and lost 2 stone (12.7 kilograms) for the film. Ewen Bremner had played Renton in the stage adaptation of Trainspotting and agreed to play the role of Spud, saying he felt the characters \"were part of my heritage.\" Boyle had heard about Jonny Lee Miller playing an American in the film Hackers and was impressed when he auditioned by doing a Sean Connery accent.Grundy, Gareth (February 1998). \"Hey! Hey! We're the Junkies!\" Neon. p. 103. For the role of Begbie, Boyle considered casting Christopher Eccleston for his resemblance to how he imagined the character in the novel, but asked Robert Carlyle instead. Carlyle said, \"I've met loads of Begbies in my time. Wander round Glasgow on Saturday night and you've a good chance of running into Begbie.\" For the role of Diane, Boyle wanted an unknown actress so audiences would not realise that a 19-year-old was playing a 15-year-old. The filmmakers sent flyers to nightclubs and boutiques and approached people on the street, eventually hiring Kelly Macdonald. The casting of Keith Allen as \"the Dealer\" was a reference to Allen's role in Shallow Grave, with the implication that he plays the same character in both."]}, {"page": "Black Hawk Down (film)", "response": ["* Ewen Bremner as SPC Shawn Nelson", "| rowspan=3 | Phoenix Film Critics Society Award || Best Acting Ensemble || Eric BanaEwen BremnerWilliam FichtnerJosh HartnettJason IsaacsEwan McGregorSam ShepardTom Sizemore ||  || rowspan=3 |"]}, {"page": "Iggy Pop", "response": ["In 1996, Pop again found mainstream fame when his 1977 song \"Lust for Life\" was featured in the film Trainspotting.
