Cynan was the son of Rhodri Molwynog and ascended to the throne of Gwynedd upon the death of King Caradog ap Meirion in 798. His epithet refers to the commote of Dindaethwy in the cantref Rhosyr. Unlike later kings of Gwynedd, usually resident at Aberffraw in western Anglesey, Cynan maintained his court at Llanfaes on the southeastern coast. Cynan's reign was marked by a destructive dynastic power struggle with a rival named Hywel, usually supposed to be his brother.\nThere is no historical record of Cynan's early years as king, but his reign ended in a combination of natural disasters and military reverses. In 810, there was a bovine plague that killed many cattle throughout Wales. The next year Deganwy, the ancient wooden court of Maelgwn Gwynedd, was struck by lightning.\nA destructive war between Cynan and Hywel raged on Anglesey between 812 and 816, ultimately ending with Cynan's defeat and banishment. Cynan and Hywel are said to be brothers in historical works such as Lloyd's History of Wales, although Lloyd does not cite its source. The Annals of Wales mention the pair only by name, without any title, relation, or patronym. (In comparison, it takes care to point out the brotherly nature of Elisedd's slaughter of Gruffydd ap Cyngen in Powys around the same time.) The genealogies from Jesus College MS 20 deny Cynan and Hywel were brothers at all, instead making Hywel the son of Caradog ap Meirion and a distant cousin of Cynan Dindaethwy son of Rhodri Molwynog. The Harleian genealogies agree with this. Cynan died within a year of his exile according to the Annals of Wales and the Irish Annals.\n\nAfter Cynan's death, there was a battle at his former court at Llanfaes on Anglesey noted by the chronicles, but the combatants are not identified.Cynan's daughter Esyllt became the mother of Merfyn Frych ap Gwriad, the first King of Gwynedd (825\u2013844) known not to have descended from the male line of Cunedda.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "816", "response": ["* Cynan Dindaethwy, king of Gwynedd (Wales)"]}, {"page": "795", "response": ["* Quarrels between the kings Cynan Dindaethwy and Hywel leave the way open for Caradog ap Meirion (the House of Rhos) to usurp the throne of Gwynedd (modern Wales)."]}, {"page": "List of rulers of Wales", "response": ["* Cynan Dindaethwy ap Rhodri (c.\u00a0798\u2013816)", "* Rhodri Mawr (854\u2013878) of Gwynedd, allegedly inheriting through his mother Nest, according to some manuscripts.

Rhodri's mother is instead taken to be Essylt daughter of Cynan Dindaethwy, last King of the House of Cunedda; it follows that Essylt was not Merfyn's mother, but his wife. Consequently those taking this view conclude that Nest's alleged marriage to Merfyn (or Rhodri) was merely a rumour spread and recorded by supporters of Gwynedd to demean the Kings of Powys, and to claim lordship over them. The House of Gwynedd's Kingship is recorded being passed jure uxoris through Essylt to her husband Merfyn, and thence distaff (ie. by the female line) to their son Rhodri on Merfyn's death, the same going for Rhodri's wife Angharad, the daughter of Meurig King of Seisyllwg when her brother Gwgon drowned without an heir, allowing Rhodri to rule Seisyllwg jure uxoris, and his son Cadell to inherit it matrilinearly."]}, {"page": "Gwriad ap Elidyr", "response": ["Almost nothing is known about Gwriad's background. He married Ethyllt ferch Cynan, daughter of Cynan Dindaethwy, King of Gwynedd. Their son Merfyn Frych later became the first king of Gwynedd known not to have come from the dynasty of its founder Cunedda. Merfyn evidently claimed the throne through his mother rather than through Gwriad, and bolstered this atypical matrilineal claim through his own power and reputation. According to the genealogies from Jesus College MS 20, Gwriad was the son of a certain Elidyr and was a descendant of Llywarch Hen and Coel Hen, rulers from the Hen Ogledd or \"Old North\", the Brittonic-speaking parts of what is now southern Scotland and northern England.Genealogies from Jesus College MS 20 17: \"Rodri ma6r m Meruyn vrych m G6rhyat m Elidyr m sandef m Alcun m tegyth m Ceit m douc m Llewarch hen m Elidyr lydanwyn m Meircha6n m G6rgust m Keneu m Coil hen. mal y mae vchot\". The bardic poetry indicates that Merfyn was \"from the land of Manaw\", a Brittonic place name applied to several districts, including Manaw Gododdin, the area around the Firth of Forth. This locale in the Hen Ogledd would be consistent with Gwriad's descent from Llywarch's northern lineage. An origin in Manaw Gododdin was supported by scholars such as William Forbes Skene and John Edward Lloyd.", "Other scholars connect Gwriad to the Isle of Man, known in Welsh as Ynis Manaw rather than Manaw Gododdin, especially following the 1896 discovery of an 8th- or 9th-century cross on Man inscribed Crux Guriat (\"Cross of Gwriad\"). Lloyd wrote that this discovery \"undoubtedly strengthens the case\" for a Manx origin. John Rhys suggested that Gwriad may have taken refuge on the Isle of Man during the bloody dynastic struggle in Gwynedd between Cynan Dindaethwy and Hywel prior to Merfyn's accession to the throne. Still other locations for \"Manaw\" have been suggested, including Ireland, Galloway and Powys."]}, {"page": "Cynan Dindaethwy ap Rhodri", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cynan Dindaethwy"]}, {"page": "Cynan ap Rhodri", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cynan Dindaethwy"]}, {"page": "Cronica Walliae", "response": ["The commentary book shows Llwyd starting his chronology of sequential records of Wales with Prince Cadwaladr of the seventh century. The first thing he explains is that he is the last British king to rule Wales, descending from the noble race of Trojans. He explains the devastating plagues that happened during his reign. He explains that the Britons had been ruled by different kings and princes for 1817 years up to Cadwaladr. Llwyd says Cadwaladr went to Rome for 5 years to study different philosophers and that he died in 688 A.D. He then explains in \"Yvor the sonne of Alan, Ina de Stirpe regia filius Kenredi sorori regis Cadwaladri\" the next sequence of events that while he was in Rome according to the comanndement received by the angell, he left his son Idwal Iwrch, his sister and his people with Alan, Kinge of litle Bryttayn. Llwyd then explains that the son of Idwal Iwrch Rhodri Molwynog became the ruler of the Kingdom of Gwynedd.  He explains in \"Rodryke the sonne of Idwall the sonne of Cadwalader\" that Rhodri began his reign in the year 720. Also in this section he details the Battle of Pencon and the Battle of Hehil. Llwyd also talks about the Battle of Carno Mountain in 728 \u2013 see eighth-century wars. In this section he also talks about the Ecclesiastical History of the English People being finished in 731 that was written by a great clercke that wroote manye woorkes named Bede from Monkwearmouth.
