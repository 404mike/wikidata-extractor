Bond was the first manager since Frank Hill (1948\u20131954) without a previous playing career at the club; fans criticised Bond for increasing Burnley's debt by signing expensive players, and for selling Lee Dixon, Brian Laws and Trevor Steven.Quelch (2017), pp. 24\u201339 In August 1984, Bond was replaced with John Benson, who was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time at the end of the 1984\u201385 season.Simpson (2007), pp. 550\u2013555 Burnley were managed briefly by Martin Buchan and then Tommy Cavanagh during 1985\u201386 before Miller returned in July 1986. For the 1986\u201387 campaign, the Football League introduced automatic relegation and promotion between the Fourth Division and the Football Conference, the top tier of non-League football in England. During the 1986\u201387 season, Burnley won only 12 of 46 league games and suffered a 3\u20130 FA Cup first round defeat at non-League Telford United. Burnley went into the season's last league match in bottom place; they needed to win against Orient, for Lincoln City to lose their game, and Torquay United to not win theirs.
