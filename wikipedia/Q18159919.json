In April 1969, Powell left and the band reverted to a duo, with Frith playing violin and Hodgkinson on keyboards and reeds. In October 1969 philosopher Galen Strawson auditioned for the band. Later, Frith and Hodgkinson persuaded bassist John Greaves to join the band, and with the services of a couple of temporary drummers and then Sean Jenkins, Henry Cow performed as a quartet for the next eight months.

Their music drew on world and ethnic musics, electronics and funk to create an alternative world dance music. Orlando Gough said in an interview, in March 1985: \"I suppose there is some kind of nebulous central core of ideas, which may be to do with us all having come out of systems music and our interest in foreign music but actually we are influenced by Frank Zappa, James Blood Ulmer, Bach\".", "Martin Ditcham had, by this time, left to tour with Sade and Simon Limbrick had joined. In his review for AllMusic, Dave Lynch noted that \"On the Rocks is startling, sometimes ominous but ultimately both funky and ethereal\"; \"Next up is the cruising and raga-esque It's Been Fun a richly detailed, tabla fuelled immersive wonder\". \"The album wraps up with the irresistible high spirits and power of Orlando Gough's The Wedding, a groovefest extraordinaire suggesting the Steve Reich Ensemble showed up at a massive global party bursting from intricate propulsive constructions into gangbusters choruses that left the revellers fully spent\".", "Of the band's members, Schaun Tozer, John Lunn and Orlando Gough went on to have the most visible solo careers as composers - in music for both film and television, Glyn Perrin works as composer and performer, whilst Simon Limbrick and Martin Ditcham established careers as internationally renowned percussionists."]}, {"page": "Blue Guitars", "response": ["* Martin Ditcham \u2013 drums"]}]}}
