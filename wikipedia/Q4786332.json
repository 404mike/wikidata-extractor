In 1924 he was chosen to contest the parliamentary constituency of Birmingham Yardley for the Labour Party. He failed to unseat the sitting Coalition Conservative MP, Alfred Jephcott,  who retained the seat with a majority of nearly 2,000 votes.At the next general election, five years later, Gossling was again chosen as Labour candidate. This time he faced two opponents, Edward Salt of the Conservatives \nand C A Beaumont of the Liberal Party. Gossling benefited from a large rise in support for Labour and the presence of the third candidate. He was elected to the Commons with a majority of 4,366 votes over Salt, while Beaumont secured 5,500 votes.Two years later another election was held. This followed the collapse of the Labour administration and the formation of a National Government, and Labour's vote dropped sharply. Gossling's Conservative opponent was again Edward Salt, the only other candidate being E J Bartlett of the New Party. Gossling was heavily defeated, with Salt winning the seat for the government by a majority of more than 15,000 votes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Birmingham Yardley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| style=\"background-color: \" | || 1929 || Archibald Gossling || Labour"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Archibald Gossling, Birmingham Yardley 1929\u201331"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Archibald Gossling"]}, {"page": "Alfred Jephcott", "response": ["He did not contest the 1929 general election, when the seat was won by the Labour candidate Archibald Gossling."]}, {"page": "Herbert Witard", "response": ["In 1936, Witard claimed to have seen a sea serpent while walking on the beach at Eccles, Norfolk, with Charles Ammon and Archibald Gossling.\"Sea serpent swimming at 90mph off the Norfolk coast\", Manchester Guardian, 8 August 1936 He remained on the council until 1951, when he stood down.
