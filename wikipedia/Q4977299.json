He obtained his medical degree from Durham University. Early in his career, he tended to coalminers and joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. The physician served with distinction in the early period of the Second World War and was mentioned in despatches. In 1941, he was recruited for a highly classified mission, Operation Tracer. In the event that Gibraltar was taken by the Axis powers, he was to be sealed into a secret chamber in the Rock of Gibraltar with five other men for about a year and report the movements of enemy vessels. Over a period of two years, the secret complex was completed and the team assembled and trained. However, the mission was never activated. Cooper returned to England and served in both civilian and military capacities. The location of the secret chamber remained a mystery for decades, but was finally discovered in 1997. However, many questions remained, including the identity of the team members. Upon Cooper's return to Gibraltar in 2008, he confirmed that the cave in question was that which had been destined for himself and his five colleagues. Dr Cooper was the last surviving team member of Operation Tracer in Gibraltar.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Military history of Gibraltar during World War II", "response": ["In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, met possibly the only member of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W.

A. Braithwaite, the commanding officer who led the team that constructed the complex. In 1998, one of the men involved in the construction of Stay Behind Cave, Dennis Woods, came forward and confirmed its authenticity. In 2006, the only living member of the 6-man team that had been chosen for Operation Tracer was interviewed. He was 92-year-old Dr. Bruce Cooper, a retired Surgeon Lieutenant of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. His visit to Gibraltar two years later, in 2008, was covered in one of the documentaries (link to a documentary below) about Operation Tracer and included a trip to Stay Behind Cave. The 94-year-old Cooper confirmed that the chamber in question was the secret complex of Operation Tracer. The survival manual for Stay Behind Cave has not yet been retrieved."]}, {"page": "Operation Tracer", "response": ["By the end of April 1942, five members of the Operation Tracer team had been selected: two surgeon-lieutenants and three signalmen. Surgeon-Lieutenant Bruce Cooper (1914\u20132010) was recruited by Levick from the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during his shore leave in 1941. When the native of Castle Eden, England, was requested to recommend another physician, he suggested Arthur Milner, a civilian doctor in Morecambe. The two physicians were friends and both had obtained their medical degrees from Durham University.", "Researchers Sergeant Major Pete Jackson of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment and Jim Crone interviewed retired Surgeon Lieutenant-Commander Bruce Cooper in England in November 2006. During the interview, Cooper related details of his early career, prior to the war. He also described the story of Levick's recruitment of himself and his friend Milner for Operation Tracer, and their \"cover\" assignments and rehearsals. At the time of that initial interview, he did not recognise maps and photographs of the Tracer complex. However, he admitted that his memory of the facility had faded. Cooper recalled a large water tank, as well as having to pedal a bicycle vigorously to generate power. Additionally, he remembered a west observation slit over the town and Detached Mole and a larger, east observation opening over the Mediterranean, the latter not only for observation, but also to lower an aerial for wireless communication. Cooper also remembered meeting the legendary Buster Crabb during his off-duty hours. He also related details of his life after the war.", "In October 2008, Cooper, the last survivor of Operation Tracer, returned to Gibraltar with his family. The team that escorted them to the secret cave complex included Jackson and the Director of the Gibraltar Museum. The event was filmed by Martin Nuza. The retired physician confirmed that the Stay Behind Cave discovered in 1997 was the same covert chamber that had been constructed for his use and that of his five colleagues. During his visit to Gibraltar, Cooper stayed at the Rock Hotel, the same place he had resided more than sixty years earlier when he first arrived for his covert mission. Other events that had been organised for Dr. Cooper and his family that week included a trip on a Gibraltar Squadron patrol boat, a tour of the World War II tunnels, and his guest appearance at the annual Trafalgar Day ceremony at the Trafalgar Cemetery. Cooper also had the opportunity to talk with the commander of the British Forces Gibraltar, Commodore Matt Parr. Surgeon Lieutenant-Commander Bruce Cooper died two years later, shortly after his 96th birthday, on 3 December 2010."]}]}}
