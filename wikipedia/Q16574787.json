Mantock did a Skype interview with the producers because she was in London at the time. In an interview with Teen Vogue, Mantock revealed that she wanted to be part of the show after reading \"how funny and smart and conscious\" the pilot script was, saying \"I thought it was a wonderful way to broach important subjects, be they women's issues or political issues, in a way that's also tied into this wonderful magical fantasy that everybody loves.\"", "While the series was praised for its diversity by casting three women of color in the lead roles, it also received backlash from some television critics for being promoted as a Latina-led series when only one of the lead actresses is Latina. Madeleine Mantock, who learned Spanish for the role, said, \"I'm open with the writers and trying to be respectful because I'm Afro-Caribbean. I'm not actually Afro-Latina and I want to make that inquiry because Melonie [Diaz] is actually the only person in her real life who is Latina.\" Sarah Jeffery explained, \"I know that we are representing the Latina community. I actually am African-American. I'm not Latina, which is a common misconception.\" Latina writer Samantha Chavarria of the website We Are Mitu felt that this news does \"highlight the very real fact that in their effort to promote a reboot, the CW used colorism and exploitation to spark our excitement and interest.\" Chavarria further criticized the network for not correcting the misinformation about the cast's ethnicities, calling it an \"ultimate stab to the wound\" and \"just plain shady\". Another Latino writer Patrick Gomez of Entertainment Weekly was more forgiving of the casting because the actresses were honest and that a search into their ethnicities would have been inappropriate, adding, \"I hope people celebrate the fact that an African-American and an Afro-Caribbean woman are being cast as 'Latinas' because Afro-Latina people are not given even a fraction of the visibility they should have in on-camera representations of Latinx people.\" Princess Weekes of The Mary Sue felt that the actresses were not to blame, but also criticized The CW's use of colorism for \"the idea that because they are lighter-skinned women with long hair, they can 'pass' for Latina when they are actually black women.\""]}, {"page": "The Long Song (TV series)", "response": ["Tamara Lawrance plays July, the series' main character.
