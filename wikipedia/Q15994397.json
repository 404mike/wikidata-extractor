She was the first woman to be appointed a professor in the Faculty of Mathematics at the University. Her research mainly concerns cosmology, astrophysics and string theory.\nDavis was a graduate student at Bristol University, under the supervision of W. Noel Cottingham. She obtained her doctorate in 1975. Following postdoctoral positions at Durham University and Imperial College London, Davis worked overseas at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland (where she became the first female theoretician) and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Since 1983 she has held positions at DAMTP, Cambridge, and King's College, Cambridge. From 2002\u20132013 she was Professor of Theoretical Physics at DAMTP and from 2013\u20132018 she held the \"Professorship of Mathematical Physics (1967)\". She has been a member of the General Board and the Council of the University of Cambridge.Davis' recent work has focused on particle cosmology, in particular investigating the chameleon theory and its relation to f(R) theory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mark Trodden", "response": ["Trodden, with his co-workers Anne-Christine Davis and Steven Davis, has also investigated the particle physics and cosmological properties of topological defects in supersymmetic theories.  Their first study, dealing with abelian theories demonstrated that all spontaneously broken abelian supersymmetric theories admit cosmic string solutions which are superconducting due to fermion zero modes. Further, by using supersymmetry transformations, they showed how to calculate the supercurrents in terms of the background string fields. They also managed to extend these results to non-abelian theories and investigated the effects of soft supersymmetry breaking."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Davis", "response": ["*Anne-Christine Davis, British physicist"]}, {"page": "Anne-Christine davis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne-Christine Davis"]}, {"page": "Christine Davis (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Anne-Christine Davis, scientist"]}, {"page": "Clare Burrage", "response": ["Burrage attributes her love of cosmology to driving past the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory as a child. She attended Collingwood College, Surrey, achieving A-Levels in Mathematics, Further Mathematics and German. She studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, earning a Masters in 2004 and Part III of the Mathematical Tripos in 2005. Whilst a student, Burrage worked at Legoland Windsor Resort. For her postgraduate research she joined Anne-Christine Davis in the Department of Applied Maths and Theoretical Physics, studying Scalar Fields and the Accelerated Expansion of the Universe. She spotted signs of the elusive chameleon particle in the active galactic nucleus of Messier 87."]}]}}
