I asked you for the band parts of the Merry Wives of Windsor\u00a0... and [you] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over.\u00a0...' Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of Thespis also at once. I am detaining the parts of Pinafore, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent you set.\" In return, the Comedy Opera Company gave notice that they intended to play Pinafore at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company. They offered the London and touring casts of Pinafore more money to play in their production, and although some choristers accepted their offer, only one principal player, Aeneas Joseph Dymott, accepted. They engaged the Imperial Theatre but had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to seize the scenery and props during Act II of the evening performance at the Opera Comique.Ainger, p. 170 Gilbert was away, and Sullivan was recovering from an operation for kidney stones.Jacobs, pp. 124\u2013125 Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery, although the stage manager, Richard Barker, and others, were injured. The cast went on with the show until someone shouted \"Fire!\" George Grossmith, playing Sir Joseph, went before the curtain to calm the panicked audience.
