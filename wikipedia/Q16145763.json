This earned England their first BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award. The victory was something of a false dawn and the remainder of the decade was not a great period for the England team. The subsequent Championship of 1981 was less successful for England, winning two of their four games, and was followed up with a draw and win against Argentina. England kicked off 1982 with a victory over the Wallabies in a tight game, winning 15 to 11 in England; the game was made famous by Erica Roe's famous streak across the pitch. Their Five Nations campaign was similarly successful, drawing with Scotland, losing to Ireland, and victories over France and Wales. At the match banquet after the win against France in Paris, there was a complimentary bottle of cologne next to each player's place at the table. Second row Maurice Colclough emptied the flask and refilled it with wine, which he then drank. Team-mate Colin Smart saw only Colclough seemingly sink a bottle of cologne and decided to follow suit. Within an hour he was on his way to hospital to have his stomach pumped, although as scrum-half Steve Smith pointed out: 'He may have been unwell, but Colin had the nicest breath I've smelt.'"]}, {"page": "1983 Five Nations Championship", "response": ["|LP ||1 ||Colin Smart ", "|LP ||1 ||Colin Smart ", "|LP ||1 ||Colin Smart ", "|LP ||1 ||Colin Smart "]}, {"page": "Cardiff Metropolitan University RFC", "response": ["*  Colin Smart"]}, {"page": "List of people from Royal Tunbridge Wells", "response": ["* Colin Smart (1950\u2013 ), rugby player"]}, {"page": "1981 England rugby union tour of Argentina", "response": ["|align=left |Colin Smart || Newport || 6 || Prop || 5|| 1|| || || || 4", "|align=right|Topo Rodriguez||align=right|P||align=center|1||P||Colin Smart", "|align=right|Topo Rodriguez||align=right|P||align=center|1||P||Colin Smart"]}, {"page": "1979 England rugby union tour of Japan, Fiji and Tonga", "response": ["*Colin Smart (Newport)"]}, {"page": "Tunbridge Wells RFC", "response": ["* Colin Smart - England"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1057||Colin Smart||prop ||1979-03-03||v France at Twickenham"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["ENGLAND: Marcus Rose, John Carleton, Clive Woodward, Paul Dodge, Mike Slemen (rep Nick Stringer 63 min), Huw Davies, Steve Smith, Colin Smart, Peter Wheeler, Gary Pearce, Bill Beaumont (c), Maurice Colclough, Nick Jeavons, Peter Winterbottom, Bob Hesford "]}, {"page": "1979 New Zealand rugby union tour of England, Scotland and Italy", "response": ["ENGLAND: Dusty Hare, John Carleton, Tony Bond, Nick Preston, Mike Slemen, Les Cusworth, Steve Smith, Fran Cotton, Peter Wheeler, Colin Smart, Bill Beaumont (c), Maurice Colclough, Tony Neary, John Scott, Mike Rafter"]}, {"page": "Smart (surname)", "response": ["*Colin Smart (born 1950), English rugby union international"]}, {"page": "1983 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Colin Smart"]}, {"page": "1982 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Colin Smart"]}, {"page": "1981 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Colin Smart"]}, {"page": "1979 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Colin Smart"]}]}}
