While at Roscoff he met his future wife Shirley, who managed the restaurant. In 1994 he opened Shanks Restaurant at the Blackwood golf centre, part of the Clandeboye Estate in Bangor.In 1996 the restaurant was awarded a Michelin Star, an award it held for ten years. Other awards include the Egon Ronay Guide Newcomer of the Year in 1995 and three Automobile Association rosettes. Millar was columnist for the Belfast Telegraph and made regular television appearances as a judge on the BBC's MasterChef programme with Lloyd Grossman.\nInfluenced by Rankin, Shanks had a Californian style. The interior of the restaurant was designed by Terence Conran.\nIn August 2005 Millar was killed in a car accident on the Ballysallagh Road near Holywood, County Down. His Maserati left the road, hitting a fence and killing him instantly. The road is an accident blackspot, with two other deaths in April 2006. His funeral was attended by other prominent local chefs Paul & Jeanne Rankin and Michael Deane. On 31 May 2006 the coroner's report into Millar's death was released. It found that he died of multiple injuries, mainly caused by the fence he crashed into. A road accident expert stated that if the fence had met new safety standards, Millar might have survived the crash. While his blood alcohol level was found to be marginally over the legal limit, the coroner did not find this to be a significant cause.Millar is interred in Ballycarry New Cemetery, alongside his brother Brian, who died in 1982.At the time of his death he had three young children, between one and six years old.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in August 2005", "response": ["*Robbie Millar, 38, Northern Irish chef and restaurateur."]}, {"page": "Ballycarry", "response": ["*The late Michelin Star chef Robbie Millar was from Ballycarry."]}, {"page": "Paul Rankin", "response": ["Many chefs and head chefs, such as Dylan McGrath, Michael Deane and Robbie Millar, have received part of their training there.", "The late Robbie Millar made his name while working at Roscoff.
