Rushing to the nearest post, he made very good use of a revolver taken from a wounded officer and then, seizing a Lewis gun, he fired it until it jammed. By this time, he was alone in the post and, having destroyed the telephone, he joined the nearest post and maintained a Lewis gun until reinforcements arrived.He was killed in action near Solesmes, France, on 16 October 1918.In 2018 a plaque was unveiled in the John McNamara Gardens in the centre of Bamber Bridge, less than half a mile from where he was born. \nThree generations of his family, Politicians, soldiers and priests all stood in tribute to Cpl John McNamara, 100 years on from the courageous act which earned him South Ribble\u2019s only Victoria Cross.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clandon Park House", "response": ["Colonel JW Sewell reached agreement with the National Trust to re-establish the Surrey Infantry Museum at Clandon House.
