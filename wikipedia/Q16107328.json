Its longest running news programme was Northern Life, which ran from 1976 to 1992. The main news show has been rebranded several times; the current version is ITV News Tyne Tees. Until December 2008, local-interest programming was usually broadcast at 19:30 on Thursdays, which are low-profile slots due to the high-rating EastEnders being broadcast at those times on BBC One. Local non-news programming was also broadcast on early Sunday evenings and various late slots following News at Ten on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Such documentaries concentrate upon local history, landscape and architecture, such as the various shows by John Grundy. A monthly political programme, Around the House, continues to be produced for the Tyne Tees and Border regions."]}, {"page": "Killingworth", "response": ["In an episode of the architecture series Grundy's Wonders on Tyne Tees, John Grundy deemed Killingworth's former British Gas Research Centre to be the best industrial building in the North East."]}, {"page": "Oriel Chambers", "response": ["Oriel Chambers and 16 Cook Street were featured in the first episode of the ITV (Granada / Tyne Tees) television series Grundy's Northern Pride, looking at John Grundy's favourite buildings in the north of England, aired on 9 January 2007."]}, {"page": "16 Cook Street", "response": ["Both 16 Cook Street and Oriel Chambers were featured in the ITV (Granada / Tyne Tees) television programme Grundy's Northern Pride, looking at John Grundy's favourite buildings in the north of England, aired on 9 January 2007."]}, {"page": "Gosforth", "response": ["Gosforth has a public library which was re-built in 2007.

Additionally, the 1960s design of the library became regarded as exceedingly ugly, with local TV presenter and author John Grundy describing it as \"a monstrous concrete blob\". The road to the rear of the library, John Dobson Street, used to have a concrete canopy which hung over the dual carriageway stretching from Durant Road up to the junction of New Bridge Street West. This canopy was at the official ground floor level of the library and provided the library with an entrance to the rear with access onto which was ultimately a rather unused large pedestrian area with seats and other street furniture. In the late 1990s the canopy was demolished back to the Bewick Court high rise block of flats which resulted in the rear-facing entrance becoming redundant, as it had nothing to connect to and became a balcony."]}, {"page": "John Grundy", "response": ["* John Grundy (television presenter) (born 1946), English television presenter and author", "* John Grundy Sr. (c. 1696\u20131748), English land surveyor and civil engineer", "* John Grundy Jr. (1719\u20131783), English civil, drainage and canal engineer"]}, {"page": "Christ Church, North Shields", "response": ["John Grundy and Grace McCombie describe Dodds's Christ Church as \"less ambitious\" than the contemporary All Saints Church, Newcastle upon Tyne.
