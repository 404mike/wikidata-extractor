The album features tracks with Chaka Khan, Jon Anderson, Kenny Lynch, and Tim Rice - the album's lyricist - on lead vocals. 1984 reached number 24 in the UK.

Both featured Pete Thoms and Gary Barnacle as regular contributors on brass and woodwind, and also featured Corrigan as lead vocalist on several tracks. Her contribution helped to characterise the bittersweet kitchen sink dramas played out in the band's often barbed songs, and allowed Heaton and Rotheray to explore and express female perspectives in their songwriting. However, the latter approach had mixed success, demonstrated later in 1992 when Corrigan chose to leave the band to pursue a solo career. Although her decision was partly prompted by a desire to record and promote her own material (which was not getting exposure within The Beautiful South), she had also had ethical disagreements over some of Heaton's lyrics, most notably \"Mini-correct\", \"Worthless Lie\" and the 0898 Beautiful South single \"36D\", which criticised the British glamour industry via scathing comments about glamour models. Five years later, Hemingway would admit \"we all agree that we should have targeted the media as sexist instead of blaming the girls for taking off their tops\"."]}, {"page": "Visage (band)", "response": ["In 1984, with their contractual problems resolved, Visage returned with their third album, Beat Boy. Released in October 1984, the album was a critical and commercial failure, peaking at No.\u00a0 79 in the UK. Two singles from the album, \"Love Glove\" and \"Beat Boy\", also failed to make the UK top 40. By this time, Billy Currie and Dave Formula had also left the band (though they received a \"special thanks\" credit on the album sleeve for their input), leaving only Strange and Egan from the original line-up along with Steve Barnacle and new recruits Gary Barnacle (Steve Barnacle's brother) and Andy Barnett who also was a member of FM and ASAP. A decision to make Visage a live band instead of a strictly studio-based project also failed to meet with success and the band split in 1985. Their final release was a Visage video compilation of the band's renowned promotional videos and other footage, including Strange's 1983 trip to North Africa. The compilation does not, however, include the original video for the \"Love Glove\" single which was filmed at a late-night Dockland location in London in 1984.", "* Gary Barnacle \u2013 saxophone (1984\u20131985)"]}, {"page": "Post (Bj\u00f6rk album)", "response": ["The track that underwent the most extensive change was \"I Miss You\", an old song from the Debut era, the result of the input of Howie Bernstein (a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hooper and an aspiring programmer), who gave the song its \"Latin-tinged [rhythm]\". Back in London, Bj\u00f6rk contacted \"old standby\" Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar \u00d6rn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on \"Enjoy\". Renowned English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Bj\u00f6rk's request. Bj\u00f6rk decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called \"Travessia\". Deodato's presence as composer and conductor \"immediately bolstered\" \"Hyperballad\", \"You've Been Flirting Again\" and \"Isobel\".
