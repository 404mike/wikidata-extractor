And, in the background, the black slaves are mostly dutiful and content, clearly incapable of an independent existence.\" Reynolds likened Gone with the Wind to The Birth of a Nation and other re-imaginings of the South during the era of segregation, in which white Southerners are portrayed as defending traditional values, and the issue of slavery is largely ignored. The film has been described as a \"regression\" that promotes both the myth of the black rapist and the honorable and defensive role of the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction, and as a \"social propaganda\" film offering a \"white supremacist\" view of the past."]}, {"page": "David Reynolds", "response": ["David Reynolds may refer to:", "* David Reynolds (author) (born 1948), English publisher and author ", "* David Reynolds (historian) (born 1952), English professor of history", "* David Reynolds (racing driver) (born 1985), Australian racing car driver", "* David Reynolds (Jericho), character in 2006 TV series Jericho", "* David Reynolds (screenwriter), American screenwriter for television and film"]}, {"page": "English PEN", "response": ["Past winners include Anita Anand's The Patient Assassin (2020),PTI (2 December 2020) \"British Indian author Anita Anand's Jallianwala Bagh story wins history prize\" The New Indian Express Edward Wilson-Lee's The Catalogue of Shipwrecked Books (2019),\"Fellow's book awarded 2019 Hessell-Tiltman Prize\" Sidney Sussex College News S.

In the so-called \"Imperialism of Free Trade\" thesis, as articulated by historians Ronald Robinson and John \"Jack\" Gallagher, the British Empire expanded as much by the growth of informal empire as it did by acquiring formal dominion over colonies.John Gallagher and Ronald Robinson, \"The Imperialism of Free Trade\",  The Economic History Review, Second series, Vol. VI, no. 1 (1953)  An online version of this seminal article is available at:   Furthermore, British investment in empire was to be found not only in the formal Empire, but also in the informal empire \u2013 and, by Robinson and Gallagher's account, was indeed predominantly located in the informal empire.  It is estimated that between 1815 and 1880, \u00a31,187,000,000 in credit had accumulated abroad, but no more than one-sixth was placed in the formal empire. Even by 1913, less than half of the \u00a33,975,000,000 of foreign investment lay inside the formal Empire.A.. H. Imlah, 'British Balance of Payments and Exports of Capital, 1816-1913', Econ. Hist. Rev. 2nd ser. V (1952), pp. 237, 239; Hancock, op. cit. p. 27. British historian David Reynolds has claimed that during the process of decolonisation, it was hoped that as an alternative to the declining formal empire, informal influence, marked by economic ties and defense treaties would hold sway over the former colonies. Reynolds suggested that the establishment of the Commonwealth was an attempt to maintain some form of indirect influence over the newly independent countries."]}, {"page": "David Reynolds (English historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Reynolds (historian)"]}, {"page": "David Reynolds (British historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Reynolds (historian)"]}, {"page": "Hitler's prophecy", "response": ["Historian David Reynolds argues that Hitler may well have been thinking partly of Roosevelt when he made the 1939 speech. At the time, the United States president was trying to persuade Americans to abandon isolationism and was promoting the emigration of Jews from Europe. Weinberg contends that, at the time of the prophecy speech, Hitler regretted allowing Neville Chamberlain to avert war in 1938, and was determined to go to war before 1940. According to Weinberg, Hitler already planned to use the war to cause a worldwide demographic revolution, of which the systematic murder of Jews was to be a crucial part. Herf argues that in his speeches referencing the prophecy, Hitler made it clear that he saw a \"causal and inherent, not a contingent or accidental, connection with his intent to exterminate the Jews\". Kershaw writes that \"the 'prophecy' denoted the indelible link in [Hitler's] mind between war and revenge against the Jews\". Koonz writes that in his 1939 speech, \"Hitler posed as the sole moral arbiter of his Volk [nation] at war on two fronts: racial and geopolitical\"."]}]}}
