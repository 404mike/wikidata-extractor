He then signed for Dundalk and made his League of Ireland debu on 16 September 1984. After one season he moved back to Ballymena where in 2 seasons he was their top scorer.\nHe joined Derry City in August 1987. He was the 1987\u201388 League of Ireland Premier Division top scorer with 24 goals. Six of these goals came in one game in a 7\u20132 win over Sligo in April 1988.Speak also helped Derry to a domestic treble in the 1988\u201389 season.\nAfter 5 years at the Brandywell he moved back to Ballymena. In the 1993/94 season he again topped their scorers chart with 13 league goals.\nHe moved back to the League of Ireland to join Finn Harps in August 1994 for \u00a314,000.\nHe led the Harps gallop to promotion in 1995\u201396, scoring 17 goals that season. Indeed, he was the club's top scorer for the next three seasons. Speak played 209 times for Harps in all competitions and scored 81 goals, 64 league goals in 152 matches. He also scored the winner in the 1999 FAI Cup semi-final in Terryland Park against Galway to send Harps to their first Cup Final in 25 years and scored again in one of the FAI Cup Final replays in Tolka Park.When Gavin Dykes took over the managerial reins from Charlie McGeever in 2000, he appointed Speak as his assistant. Speak was also manager of a very talented Harps Under 21 team at the time.\nWhen Dykes resigned after an abysmal run of games that left Harps rooted to the bottom of the Premier table, Speak took over as caretaker, if somewhat reluctantly. He took Harps on an amazing unbeaten run of 14 games only to be cruelly relegated on the last day of the season.\nHe took on the position of player-manager on a permanent position the following season (2001/02), which would see only the champions of the First Division gain automatic promotion. Drogheda United would win the league, again on the last day of the season as Harps finished second. They faced Longford Town in the playoffs and after a one nil defeat away in Flancare Park, Harps produced one of their best displays in Finn Park since the '70s. They went one down early in the first half but they battled like warriors with Kevin McHugh scoring a superb hat-trick. Unfortunately it wasn't to be as Speak conceded an injury time penalty in extra time and Harps were then beaten on penalties.\nThe following season saw Waterford United make all the running to go up as champions and once more Harps had to settle for runners-up spot and a place in the playoffs which was abruptly ended by Galway United in the semi-final. Speak did lead Harps to lift their first national silverware in 28 years beating Kildare County 4\u20130 on aggregate in the final of the First Division Cup in September 2002.\nThe 2003 season would be the first to be played in the calendar year. Speak started what would be his third and final season as Harps manager and in August Harps were sitting top of the league. With Dublin City, Kildare County and Bray Wanderers all pushing hard for the coveted top spot and automatic promotion, there was to be little room for error. Unfortunately three points from twelve in Harps last four games, including a home defeat to Sligo and a draw in Finn Park against leaders Dublin City left Harps in fourth place and five points off the pace. Even though Harps had only lost two games all season, too many draws and dropped points against poor opposition signalled the end of the road for the Sion-man and his nine-year association with the club.He managed Omagh Town in 2004 Speak was top scorer in the 1987\u201388 League of Ireland Premier Division and in the 1995\u201396 League of Ireland First Division. At the end of the 2012 League of Ireland season, Speak is joint thirteenth in the all-time League of Ireland goalscoring list with 135 league goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Finn Harps F.C.", "response": ["In 1998\u201399, Finn Harps finished fourth in the Premier Division; one point behind Shelbourne in third position and just missed out on Europe. They made it to the 1999 FAI Cup Final but lost to Bray Wanderers after a number of replays, leaving themselves with nothing to show (bar the Irish News Cup) for what is considered to be one of their most impressive seasons. After a very poor start to the 1999\u201300 season, and with the team having won one point from a possible 21, McGeever resigned as manager. The club appointed Gavin Dykes as manager and, though he managed to retain the club's Premier Division status, they were forced to go public company due to financial difficulties and debts amounting to \u00a3280,000. The following season, and after an abysmal run of results, Dykes resigned. Fan-favourite Jonathan Speak took his place as new financial structures were put into place and a newly appointed fund-raising committee established along with numerous supporter clubs around the country. However, after a run of 14 games undefeated and a late-season fightback, Finn Harps were ultimately relegated to the First Division on the last day of the season. This ended a five-year run in the top flight."]}, {"page": "League of Ireland First Division", "response": ["| Jonathan Speak"]}, {"page": "League of Ireland Premier Division", "response": ["| Jonathan Speak"]}, {"page": "History of Derry City F.C.", "response": ["With no further hurdles standing in the way, Derry City joined the Republic's league, the League of Ireland, in the newly created League of Ireland First Division in 1985 as a semi-professional outfit (although they did adopt professional football while Noel King was in charge between late-1985 and 1987). However, if they thought that this would provide an escape from the marginalisation and sectarian politics in Northern Irish football, they would have to think again \u2013 Derry's supporters' buses often came under attack from sectarian gangs with stones and other missiles as they travelled through loyalist areas en route to away games in the Republic of Ireland. On occasion, buses still take a detour in order to avoid potential trouble-spots \u2013 especially on the days of high-profile games. Nevertheless, the city responded in their thousands. Jim Crossan had been appointed manager and he made Terry Kelly his team-captain. Derry's first match in the League of Ireland was played at the Brandywell on 8 September 1985 and saw Derry beat Home Farm of Dublin by a score of 3\u20131.\"Derry City 3 \u2013 1 Home Farm \", CityWeb, 2007. The game itself was actually played as part of the League Cup. Barry McCreadie was Derry's first goal-scorer that day. The club's first League of Ireland hat-trick came when Kevin Mahon fired three past Finn Harps at Finn Park on 15 December 1985. Jim Crossan did not remain in charge of the team for long, however, and his quick departure by the end of 1985 allowed new manager Noel King to bring worldly flair to the Brandywell in the form of the Brazilian, Nelson da Silva, and South African, Owen Da Gama. A throwback to Derry's Irish League days saw Declan McDowell solidify the defence while Kevin Mahon worked wonders on the wing. With another local favourite, Tony O'Doherty, in midfield, the club went on to clinch the League of Ireland First Division Shield in their first season of football in the Republic of Ireland with a 6\u20131 aggregate victory over Longford Town FC.\"Historic Shield Victory for City \", CityWeb, 2007.
