A jealous George rings up his old flame Gloria Rumbold (Claire Davenport) and arranges to meet up for a drink with her - though neither reunion turns out to be as the Ropers had hoped as Lee invites half the airbase to the reunion and Gloria turns out to be an overweight loud-speaking massage parlour worker."]}, {"page": "Some Will, Some Won't", "response": ["* Claire Davenport as Blowzy Woman\t"]}, {"page": "Christmas Night with the Stars", "response": ["*The Rag Trade \u2013 Peter Jones, Miriam Karlin, Reg Varney, Esma Cannon, with Barbara Windsor, Sheena Marshe, Patricia Denys, Claire Davenport"]}, {"page": "On the Buses (film)", "response": ["*Claire Davenport \u2013 Peggy"]}, {"page": "Freud (miniseries)", "response": ["*Claire Davenport ...
