His biographer Ian Parrott records that he loathed Eton, \"with its hearty adolescent bawling of Victorian hymns in an all-male college chapel\". He was equally unhappy with other aspects of school life, such as the Officers' Training Corps, the suggestive homosexuality, and endemic bullying.Parrott, pp. 20\u201323 He found relief in music and, perhaps because of the connection with his uncle, formed an interest in Delius that developed into a near-obsession. He also found a kindred spirit in an Eton music teacher and Delius advocate, the cellist Edward Mason, from whom Heseltine borrowed a copy of the score of Sea Drift. He thought it \"heavenly\", and was soon requesting funds from his mother to purchase more of Delius's music. According to Cecil Gray, Heseltine's first biographer, \"[Heseltine] did not rest until he had procured every work of Delius which was then accessible\".Gray 1934, pp. 36\u201337", "In February 1916 Heseltine returned to London, ostensibly to argue for exemption from military service.

The Finnish critic Karl Wasenius (aka BIS), writing in Hufvudstadsbladet after the birthday celebration performances of 1915, wrote approvingly of Sibelius's \"refined mastery\" of technique. \"Not a single note is wasted on brash effects\", Wasenius continued. \"Yet mighty things are still achieved. Sibelius gives us the expanse and magnitude of the ocean, its powerful wave-song but without boastful gestures. He is too noble for that\". In Tidning f\u00f6r musik, Otto Anderssen interpreted Sibelius's latest compositions (among them The Oceanides) as yet another indicator that he was among the most forward-looking modernists: \"Sibelius is, I believe, a man of the future\u00a0... constantly ahead of his time. Now he stands at the heights where the horizon stretches out over fields which the rest of us cannot yet see\".
