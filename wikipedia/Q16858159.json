A lifeboat house was not provided until the Tees Bay Lifeboat and Shipwreck Society sourced one in 1843. In 1911, the RNLI provided a new lifeboat in response to the mounting number of shipwrecks on the east coast. This needed to be somewhere that a lifeboat could be launched and recovered no matter the weather or tide state and the new location of Teesmouth fitted the bill perfectly. The 1911 lifeboat was moored afloat until a new lifeboathouse was provided in 1914.
