He was the son of Benjamin Henry Blackwell (1849\u20131924), founder of Blackwell's bookshop in Oxford, which went on to become the Blackwell family's publishing and bookshop empire, located on Broad Street in central Oxford. The publishing arm is now part of Wiley-Blackwell.\nHe was educated at Magdalen College School, Oxford and Merton College, Oxford. He was the first person in his family to attend university.He is remembered as the bookseller who helped break the infamous \"Ring\" who colluded to close off open competition in auctions, \"taking bread from the mouths of the widows and orphans\" of Oxford scholars.In 1913 he began working with his father at Blackwell's. Upon his father's death in 1924, he took over the company and remained working there for decades.He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1956 by Queen Elizabeth II, the only bookseller ever to receive that honour. In 1959 he was elected to an honorary Fellowship at Merton. In 1970 he was given the honorary Freedom of the City of Oxford. In 1979 he was awarded a Doctorate of Civil Law honoris causa at the Oxford Encaenia.\nBlackwell was a prosecution witness in the 1966 private prosecution attempt to bar the book Last Exit to Brooklyn from UK publication.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Documentary film", "response": ["* Wyver, John.

However, the boundary between barristers and solicitors has evolved. In England today, the barrister  monopoly covers only appellate courts, and barristers must compete directly with solicitors in many trial courts.Richard L. Abel, The Legal Profession in England and Wales (London: Basil Blackwell, 1989), 116. In countries like the United States, which have fused legal professions, there are trial lawyers who specialize in trying cases in court, but trial lawyers do not have a legal monopoly like barristers. In some countries, litigants have the option of arguing pro se, or on their own behalf. It is common for litigants to appear unrepresented before certain courts like small claims courts; indeed, many such courts do not allow lawyers to speak for their clients, in an effort to save money for all participants in a small case.See, e.g., Cal. Code. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 116.530 (preventing attorneys from appearing in small claims court except as parties or witnesses). In other countries, like Venezuela, no one may appear before a judge unless represented by a lawyer.Rogelio P\u00e9rez-Perdomo, \"The Venezuelan Legal Profession: Lawyers in an Inegalitarian Society,\" in Lawyers in Society: The Civil Law World, vol. 2, eds. Richard L. Abel and Philip S.C. Lewis, 380\u2013399 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 387. The advantage of the latter regime is that lawyers are familiar with the court's customs and procedures, and make the legal system more efficient for all involved. Unrepresented parties often damage their own credibility or slow the court down as a result of their inexperience.Gordon Kent, \"Lawyerless Litigants: Is Justice Being Served?\" Edmonton Journal, 27 January 2002, A1.Alan Feuer, \"Lawyering by Laymen: More Litigants Are Taking a Do-It-Yourself Tack,\" The New York Times, 22 January 2001, B1."]}, {"page": "Oxford", "response": ["* Sir Basil Blackwell: 12 January 1970."]}, {"page": "Thomas Hobbes", "response": ["* Oakeshott, Michael (1975).

However, in contradistinction to moral error theory, epistemological moral skeptical arguments for this conclusion do not include the premise that \"all moral claims are false.\" For example, Michael RuseM. Ruse, Taking Darwin Seriously (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1986) gives what Richard Joyce  calls an \"evolutionary argument\" for the conclusion that we are unjustified in believing any moral proposition. He argues that we have evolved to believe moral propositions because our believing the same enhances our genetic fitness (makes it more likely that we will reproduce successfully). However, our believing these propositions would enhance our fitness even if they were all false (they would make us more cooperative, etc.). Thus, our moral beliefs are unresponsive to evidence; they are analogous to the beliefs of a paranoiac. As a paranoiac is plainly unjustified in believing his conspiracy theories, so too are we unjustified in believing moral propositions. We therefore have reason to jettison our moral beliefs."]}, {"page": "Matterhorn", "response": ["* Guido Rey The Matterhorn (translated J. E. C.
