By 1979, Jerry Falwell had used \"Adam and Steve\".Christianity Today, 16 November 1979, p.48, as quoted in  In 1977, it was used on a protest sign, as mentioned in a New York Times news service report about a November 19 rally in Houston that year. The phrase was used in \"The Gay Bar\", an episode of Maude broadcast on December 3, 1977. Two years later, Jerry Falwell gave the phrase wider circulation in a Christianity Today report of a press conference he had given. The phrase later acquired a certain notoriety, and, when used to name a pair of characters in a work of fiction, helps to identify them as members of a homosexual pair (Paul Rudnick's play The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told, the 2005 film Adam & Steve and other works). The phrase was used by the Democratic Unionist Party MP David Simpson during the 2013 British House of Commons' debate on same-sex marriage, although a slip of the tongue saying \"in the Garden of Eden, it was Adam and Steve\" initially caused laughter in the chamber. Zimbabwean presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa said in an interview that \"[w]e must be able to respect what God ordained and how we are created as a people, there are a male and a female, there are Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve\". The phrase was also reclaimed by LGBT people and used in blogs, comics, and other media mocking the anti-gay message."]}, {"page": "David Trimble", "response": ["At the general elections of 2005, Trimble was defeated in Upper Bann by the Democratic Unionist Party's David Simpson in his bid for re-election to Parliament in Westminster.
