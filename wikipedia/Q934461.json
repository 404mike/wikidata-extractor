Jack is re-introduced as a changed man, reluctantly immortal, having spent years on Earth waiting to reunite with the Doctor. Jack recruits policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) to the team of experts after she discovers them; there are hints of romantic feelings between the two, but Gwen has a boyfriend and Jack enters a sexual relationship with the team's general factotum Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd). Despite having worked with him for some time, his present-day colleagues know very little about him; over the course of the series they discover that he cannot die. Jack was once a prisoner of war, and was an interrogator who used torture. In the Torchwood Series 1 finale \"End of Days\", Jack returns to the TARDIS. This immediately leads into the 2007 Doctor Who episode \"Utopia\", where he joins the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). Jack explains he returned from Satellite 5 to the present day by travelling to 1869 via vortex manipulator, and lived through the 20th century waiting for the Doctor. By the series finale, having spent a year in an alternative timeline enslaved by The Master (John Simm), Jack opts to return to his team in Cardiff. Before departing, Jack speculates about his immortality and reminisces about his youth on the Boeshane Peninsula, revealing that his nickname had been the \"Face of Boe\", suggesting that he may one day become the non-humanoid recurring character of the same name, voiced by Struan Rodger.", "In addition to the paperback novels, Jack also appears in Torchwood audio books, the first four being Hidden written by Steven Savile and narrated by Naoko Mori, Everyone Says Hello written by Dan Abnett and narrated by Burn Gorman, released February 2008, In the Shadows by Joseph Lidster and narrated by Eve Myles, released September 2008, and The Sin Eaters written by Brian Minchin and narrated by Gareth David-Lloyd, released September 2008. Joseph Lidster also wrote a BBC Radio 4 Torchwood drama, \"Lost Souls\" which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Freema Agyeman. Set after the events of the 2008 series, Jack and his team make their first international adventure to CERN in Geneva, as part of Radio 4's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on. The special radio episode's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite, as well as the team's mourning of Toshiko and Owen's recent deaths.", "When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series of Doctor Who, he is told \"don't you dare\" when pointing a gun, and scolded when contemplating snapping the Master's neck. Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen in Torchwood, Jack shoots his killer in the forehead, killing him in an act of swift revenge. Whilst the Doctor scolds Jack for joining the Torchwood Institute (an organisation he perceives as xenophobic and aggressive), Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctor's image; Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th-century Torchwood. Actor Gareth David-Lloyd describes the 19th century Torchwood as \"quite ruthless and quite evil\" and \"on the other side\" from Jack and the Doctor. Through Jack, whose perspective is widened by his experiences in other planets and times, the organisation was able to grow less jingoistic. One academic article, which compares Torchwood to the American drama series 24, opines that Jack's attitudes make the show's ethos largely antithetical to that of 24. Because Jack explores the \"complexity of negotiating differing worldviews, cultural values, beliefs, and moral codes\" through a framework established by the Doctor, to \"value life, support democratic principles and egalitarianism, and protect those who cannot protect themselves\", consequently \"The world of Torchwood is depicted, not as the dichotomous \"us\" (or United States) and \"other\" of Jack Bauer's 24, but as the omnipolitical, omnisexual, omnicultural world of Jack Harkness.\" Porter finds, however, that like Bauer, Jack saves the world using similarly morally grey means when he tortures Beth the sleeper agent, in \"Sleeper\", in order to avert an interplanetary attack.", "In a Doctor Who Magazine interview, Barrowman described Jack's love for Ianto as \"lustful\", and explained \"I don't think he'd settle down with Ianto. He might do, but he'd let Ianto know that he [Jack] has to play around on the side\". The Torchwood Series Two premiere sees Jack ask Ianto out on a date, after finding out Gwen is engaged. John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd opined in an interview at Comic-Con to fan questions that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him. John Barrowman said in an interview that Ianto \"brings out the \"human\" in [Jack]\" and \"brings out more ... empathy because he\u2019s actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody ... [which] makes him warm to other people ... [and] makes him more approachable.\" In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that \"I think Ianto\u2019s always made him care and that is really the heart of the show.\" However, Stephen James Walker feels that Jack's relationship with Ianto is one-sided; Ianto seems to feel the relationship is \"serious and committed\", but while dancing with Gwen in \"Something Borrowed\", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a \"recreational activity\", and considers it \"obvious Jack only has eyes and thoughts for Gwen\".Walker, pg 197 The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Ianto confides in Gwen that he knows that to Jack he is \"just a shag\", though discloses that the relationship means more to him. In the same novel, however, he also refers to himself in front of Jack as his \"boyfriend\". When Ianto expounds these same insecurities to Jack in the radio play \"The Dead Line\" (just prior to Children of Earth), however, Jack insists \"You will never be just a blip in time, Ianto Jones. Not to me.\"", "Just as Jack and Ianto's relationship is developing, Ianto dies, in Children of Earth (2009). While some fans felt \"cheated\" at not seeing the relationship develop further, Davies explains his intention was to heighten the tragedy by it also being a loss of potential, stating \"You grieve over everything they could have been. Everything you hoped for them.\" For dramatic purposes within the story, Davies explains that Ianto's death was necessary so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his own grandson. Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the lack of resolution for the love story is \"part of the tragedy\". Lynnette Porter feels that Ianto's demise is intended as a watershed moment where Jack loses his effectiveness as a hero. At least for a time, a grieving Jack loses his focus and gives up; within a few months, Jack flees Earth and his role as the expected hero. Some fans were displeased by Ianto's death scene and the end of the relationship, and some even accused one the writers of \"deliberately egging on the shippers'\". Subsequent to Ianto's death, in \"The End of Time\" (2010), the Doctor sets up Jack with a new romantic interest, Alonso Frame (Tovey). Fans of Ianto, who felt cheated by the character's death, disliked this development. GayNZ.com compared the situation to Buffy fans' reaction to Willow's relationship with Kennedy (Iyari Limon) in Buffys seventh season, following Tara's death in the show's sixth.", "Barrowman states in a behind-the-scenes featurette that Gwen brings a \"little bit of soul\" back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a \"palpable love\" and opines that \"with Jack and Gwen, it\u2019s the real thing and they\u2019re going to make you wait for that.\" The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode \"Ghost Machine\" as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of \"her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour\", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: \"the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him\u00a0\u2013 it'd be hard not to\". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a \"compelling trickster\", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his \"outrageous flirting\". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of \"steady prince\" for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, \"he'd have to commit completely\"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could \"never afford to do anything more\". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, \"there\u2019s two different sorts of love going on there\", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy."]}, {"page": "FedCon", "response": ["| Joe Flanigan \u2013 Luciana Carro \u2013 James Marsters \u2013 David Hewlett \u2013 Terry Farrell \u2013 Michael Dorn \u2013 Gareth David-Lloyd \u2013 Aaron Douglas \u2013 Kandyse McClure \u2013 Tahmoh Penikett \u2013 Gordon Michael Woolvett \u2013 Martha Hackett \u2013 Cliff Simon \u2013 Chase Masterson \u2013 Tsuneo Sanda \u2013 David Messina \u2013 Manu Intiraymi \u2013 Suzie Plakson \u2013 Robert Vogel \u2013 Franco Urru \u2013 James Cawley \u2013 Ed Wasser "]}, {"page": "March 1981", "response": ["*Born: Gareth David-Lloyd, Welsh TV actor (Ianto Jones on Torchwood), in Bettws, Newport"]}, {"page": "Torchwood", "response": ["Torchwood follows the exploits of a small team of alien-hunters, who make up the Cardiff-based, fictional Torchwood Institute which deals mainly with incidents involving extraterrestrials.

A regular within the show, Ianto appears in every episode of the programme's first three series excluding the finale of series 3, as well as two crossover episodes of Torchwoods parent show, Doctor Who. Additionally, Ianto appears in Expanded Universe material such as the Torchwood novels and audiobooks, comic books and radio plays. Within the narrative of the series, Ianto begins as general support officer for Torchwood Three, a team of alien hunters stationed in Cardiff, and develops into an active field agent. Initially the regular character with the least screen time, Ianto's role expanded in response to growing cult appeal.", "First published in January 2008, the monthly Torchwood Magazine began occasionally including Torchwood comic strips, in which Ianto also appears. In 2010, Shrouded is one such two-part comic, written by Gareth David-Lloyd. The comic posits a \"what-if\" scenario wherein Ianto, \"who struggles with his feelings for Jack from the offset\", sees a face from the future and embarks on a mission that could change the course of his life (from that of his eventual death in Children of Earth). David Lloyd comments that he \"knows [the] character implicitly\". In the first part, Ianto (originating from the timeframe of Season Two) is approached by Rhys and Captain John, both post-Children of Earth, who warn Ianto not to believe the offer made by a seductive, time-travelling woman; they do not tell him that their mission is to preserve the timeline in which he dies. In part two, the woman, Mairwyn, informs Ianto of the events of \"Exit Wounds\" and Children of Earth, and of Jack's departure. Ianto tearfully watches the scene where Jack learns of Gwen's engagement, and sleeps with Mairwyn. After learning of the devastating consequences of assisting Mairwyn, he defeats her and later \"retcons\" himself. However, in a divergent timeline Ianto appears with Mairwyn, observing his funeral, saying \"I can't believe there's a reality where I said no.\" In 2010, \"Shrouded\" was republished in Titan's dedicated Torchwood comic book.", "During series two, the Torchwood website, www.torchwood.org.uk also hosted an interactive online game written by series writer Phil Ford. Updated weekly with the airing of the new episodes, the website features specially shot footage with Gareth David-Lloyd in character as Ianto debriefing and informing the 'player' with regards to their mission. Throughout both series one and two, the interactive websites co-written by James Goss featured electronic literature content (such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters) which depict aspects of Ianto and the other Torchwood characters' work and personal lives. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature in hardback form, along with new original material, some of which expands on what we know of Ianto. For example, it introduces his sister, Rhiannon and brother-in-law Johnny; Rhiannon and Johnny later appear in 2009's third televised series.", "Ianto also appears in Torchwood audio books, the first two being Hidden written by Steven Savile and narrated by Naoko Mori, Everyone Says Hello written by Dan Abnett and narrated by Burn Gorman, released February 2008, and In the Shadows by Joseph Lidster, released in September 2008. Joseph Lidster also wrote a BBC Radio 4 Torchwood drama, \"Lost Souls\" which aired in Summer 2008 as an Afternoon Play featuring the voices of John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Freema Agyeman (Martha). Set after the events of the 2008 series, Ianto and the team make their first international adventure to CERN in Geneva, as part of Radio 4's special celebration of the Large Hadron Collider being switched on. The special radio episode's plot focuses on the Large Hadron Collider's activation and the doomsday scenario some predicted it might incite, as well as the team's mourning of Toshiko and Owen's recent deaths.", "Gareth David-Lloyd has revealed that his character was originally named Idris Hopper. This has led to speculation that he was the same Idris Hopper played by Aled Pedrick who appeared in the 2005 Doctor Who episode \"Boom Town\" as Margaret Blaine's (Annette Badland) personal assistant. Writer Stephen James Walker wonders if Russell T Davies intended Idris to become a major character on Torchwood in the same way as Toshiko Sato, who originated in Doctor Who's \"Aliens of London\". Idris Hopper has since appeared in Gary Russell's Torchwood novel The Twilight Streets. Initially, Ianto is introduced as a quiet worker and the least active character in the supporting cast. David-Lloyd started the role believing Ianto would be killed off at the end of the first series, and was surprised when they \"worked the character to become more popular, and it started growing from there.\"", "When Gareth David-Lloyd was cast in the role, the character was renamed Ianto Jones. This was inspired by the character of Yanto Jones, also played by David-Lloyd, in Russell T Davies's 2004 comedy-drama Mine All Mine. Ianto shares the surname \"Jones\" with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones, Torchwood character Eugene Jones (\"Random Shoes\"), and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies's earlier Queer as Folk; Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. In developing the character's attire, costume designer Ray Holman comments: \"Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot. He started off with some nice but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one, which were top-end fitted ones but always very sober. Towards the end of series one, I also got him into a waistcoat, and everyone thought that looked really good.", "Appearing in series two, Ianto assists the team in field missions and is used by the writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that \"This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack\u00a0\u2014 he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier.\" The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. \"For series two,\" comments Ray Holman, \"we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits come from all over the place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition.\"", "In Torchwood Magazine, actor Gareth David-Lloyd comments on some original character developments intended for Ianto. Originally, his character was the one supposed to die at the end of series two episode \"Reset\".Hugo, Simon (August 2008) \"Me & Mr Jones\". Torchwood Magazine (5) : 8-14 Davies's plan had originally intended for Ianto to be revived, as Owen eventually was, in episode seven. From this point on, the character was intended to be \"the Living Dead\u00a0\u2014 pale, but still sexy\". The night before filming, however, Davies changed his mind and seven scripts began a process of being rewritten. New lines had to be handed to the actors on the day of filming. Davies also called a discussion with the actors involved to explain the change in the storyline.Davies, Russell T; Cook, Benjamin (14 January 2010). The Writer\u2019s Tale: The Final Chapter (2nd ed.). Page 101 In the discussion with executive producer Russell T Davies and Burn Gorman, who portrays Owen, it was decided that Owen would experience the zombification storyline as he is a character who more overtly enjoys life, making it more interesting from a narrative perspective.", "Much of Ianto's character development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that \"To have a storyline where you're involved with the leading character for any actor is awesome.\" On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, \"he's found his meaning and ... he's happier.\" Asked what it is that Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds \"Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think.\" John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto \"brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable.\" In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that \"I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down.\"", "Comparing Jack's relationship with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states \"I think [there are] different sorts of love or lust, as it might be, and I think that's an ongoing thing ... At the moment, I think there's two different sorts of love going on there.\" He also states that he feels that Ianto's relationship with Jack is his first same-sex relationship, and doesn't feel that Ianto would be a \"labelist\", but were he, he would identify as bisexual, but that he \"wouldn't regard himself the same way as Jack does because they're from different times.\" Author Stephen James Walker feels sorry for Ianto, perceiving his relationship with Jack as a one-sided one. To him, Ianto views the relationship as \"serious and committed\", as seen in \"A Day in the Death\" where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in \"Something Borrowed\", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a \"recreational activity\". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as this is the first time that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew.Walker, p. 197 The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying \"You do know he's ...\", which Ianto finishes \"Just a shag?\" before adding \"Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual.\" In radio play \"The Dead Line\", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real. When asked if the relationship will continue in series three, executive producer Julie Gardner replied, \"Yes, I like seeing them as a couple\", while director Euros Lyn stated that \"the love story between Captain Jack and Ianto [would continue] to unfold\" in the third series. While Gareth David-Lloyd feels that the love story between Jack and Ianto was not fully resolved, which is \"part of the tragedy\", the character and his relationship with Jack had been sufficiently explored in the third series for David-Lloyd to be \"happy to walk away from it.\"", "Most of the fans expressed their displeasure following Ianto's death in the third series. The website End of Show comments that \"writer James Moran was so inundated with messages to his Twitter account that he posted a number of impassioned pleas to tone down the vitriol.\" End of Show writer Kirsty Walker comments that fans on Twitter accused Moran of \"deliberately egging on the 'shippers'.\" Moran noted in his blog that of the thousands of messages from viewers, the \"vast majority\" were extremely positive, managing to express that they were \"upset, angry and shocked\" without making personal attacks. Moran declared the response from other commentators to be unacceptable, describing their conduct as the spewing of insults and \"passive aggressive nonsense\". He noted that fans had accused him of deliberately trying to \"mislead\", \"lie\" and \"hurt\" them, said that he hated them, was \"laughing at them\" and \"slapping [them] in the face\", and claimed that he had \"killed the show\", had attempted to drive away existing fans to court newer and \"cooler\" viewers, and had deliberately hurt depressed people \"with dark storylines.\" In a poll conducted by Digital Spy shortly after Ianto's death, 27.4% of voters claimed that they would no longer watch Torchwood. Responding to these results, Gareth David-Lloyd thanked the fans for their dedication to the show and the character but urged them to have faith in the writers. On the show's Facebook groups, fans expressed anger towards creator Russell T Davies and some claimed they would stop watching the show. Walker herself had felt that the end of Jack's relationship with Ianto could \"change the show beyond all recognition.\"", "Soon after the death of Ianto Jones during Torchwood's third series, a campaign to bring him back was started through networking sites such as LiveJournal, Twitter and Facebook. The resulting website, www.saveiantojones.com, has organised a protest which encourages fans to send coffee, along with postcards and letters of complaint, to the BBC, a reference to Ianto's status as the \"coffee boy\". Via the Save Ianto Jones website, fans are also campaigning to raise money for the BBC charity Children in Need in honour of the character. The fundraising site states that \"Though we, his devoted fans, still hope that he'll come back ... we mourn him. In the series, he died saving the children of Earth; so it seems fitting to honour his memory by helping the Children in Need.\" Torchwood Magazine reported that the site had raised nearly \u00a34,000, with individual donations ranging from \u00a32 to \u00a350. John Barrowman described the charity campaign as \"a fun way to mourn Ianto\" and stated that it was \"the kind of thing that's really appreciated\". Gareth David-Lloyd was flattered by the strong fan reaction, saying it is \"satisfying in drama when you create such an emotional response, because that's what you set out to do in the first place\". He praised the fan donations, claiming \"So far, they've raised about \u00a33,000 for Children in Need, and \u00a31,000 for Lluest Horse and Pony Trust in West Wales, which I'm a patron of, so that's got to be a good thing\". Coventry Telegraph records that by 21 July 2009, \u00a34,172 had been donated in Ianto's name.", "On 31 July 2009, Digital Spy conducted a poll asking if it was \"time to move on\" from Ianto. However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing \"unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll was the subject of a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome\". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans \"suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious\". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it was time to move on, \"while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate\", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as \"sickening\" and quoted \"crazed\" fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called \"completely unacceptable\". David-Lloyd added that he \"would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that\". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the \"ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions\" of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as \"thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, and doing what we can to be supportive of the character and actor\". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: \"Not reversing it. Stop asking.\" In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding \"indifferent\" and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the \"scary\" fan reaction, maintaining that \"a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting\"."]}, {"page": "List of Torchwood characters", "response": ["thumb|140px|right|Gareth David-Lloyd plays general factotum Ianto Jones", "Ianto Jones, played by Welsh actor Gareth David-Lloyd, is Torchwood Three's support man.

After the episode was written and filmed, Chibnall discovered two main plot holes in the story. The first is that he did not make clear that everything about Lisa, including the scene where she acted human was all part of her plan for her Cyberman-influence to take over, and reflected to adding at least two lines of dialogue to explain her motives clearly. The second was Jack having a cut lip in the end, even though he is immortal and all his wounds would have healed quickly.
