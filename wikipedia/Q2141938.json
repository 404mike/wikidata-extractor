He backed lower taxes, saving, reversing commons enclosures and resisting the 1821 gold standard. He sought an end to borough-mongers, sinecurists and overpaid bureaucratic \"tax-eaters\" and stockbrokers, and typecast British Jews in a similar way.. Early in life he was a soldier and devotee of king and country, but later pursued a radicalism that helped to produce the Reform Act 1832 and gain him one of two seats in Parliament for the new borough of Oldham. He urged Catholic emancipation. He saw British agriculture and other economic output geographically. His polemics range from political reform to religion. His best known book is Rural Rides (1830, still in print). He argued against Malthusianism, saying economic betterment could support global population growth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Agrarianism", "response": ["In land law the heyday of English, Irish (and thus Welsh) agrarianism was  to 1603, led by the Tudor royal advisors, who sought to maintain a broad pool of agricultural commoners from which to draw military men, against the interests of larger landowners who sought enclosure (meaning complete private control of common land, over which by custom and common law lords of the manor always enjoyed minor rights). The heyday was eroded by hundreds of Acts of Parliament to expressly permit enclosure, chiefly from 1650 to the 1810s.

Fearful lest they be taken as evidence of him being a 'spy in the interest of France', Priestley sent a clumsy letter to numerous newspaper editors, in which he naively named \"MBP\" (Member of the British Parliament) as Mr. Benjamin Vaughan, who \"like me, thought it necessary to leave England, and for some time is said to have assumed a feigned name.\"Vaughan had fled to France in May 1794, when John Hurford Stone's brother, William, was arrested and found to have a letter from Vaughan.
