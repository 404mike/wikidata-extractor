Helm also asked how they would respond if the march was banned, and was told that they would simply march elsewhere. This meant that any ban would have to be imposed, manned and enforced across the entire Metropolitan Police district, which would still not prevent the NF from marching outside of the proscribed area. A ban on marching would also not prevent the NF instead holding a static public meeting \"perhaps in provocative circumstances\", which would still attract a counter-demonstration. The police dilemma was further compounded by the limitations of the Public Order Act 1936, which granted no powers of arrest in the event that a ban was ignored."]}, {"page": "McNee", "response": ["*David McNee (born 1925) former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and Chief Constable of City of Glasgow Police"]}, {"page": "John Smith (police officer)", "response": ["He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal (QPM) in the 1986 New Year Honours and was knighted in the 1994 New Year Honours, unusually while his superior, Commissioner Paul Condon, was not a knight\"Yes, sir\", The Times, 31 December 1993 (Condon was knighted in the 1994 Birthday Honours).
