The Schwarzenberg Wind Harmonie of 1771 employed 2 cor anglais as well as 2 oboes, 2 bassoons and 2 horns.  Prince Joseph Adam Johann Nepomuk Franz de Paula Joachim Judas Thadd\u00e4us Abraham von Schwarzenberg (1680\u20131732) was a keen boar hunter and so most probably employed oboe da caccia players, which explains the preference for the new cor anglais as opposed to the clarinet. Johan Went was first cor anglais and Ignaz Teimer (father of the Teimer brothers) was second cor anglais. The first oboe trios were composed by Johan Went for the Teimer brothers. The oboe and cor anglais writing in these original Bohemian/Viennese trios by Johan Went and Joseph Triebensee comprise the first music written by oboists for oboists and contain the first examples of florid virtuosic writing for the cor anglais, paving the way for the florid compositions of Bellini, Donizetti, Pasculi, and Liszt.  In 1796 Johann and Franz Teimer died. The first recorded performance of an oboe trio was 1793 (which Beethoven attended). Within this short period of five years, when the Teimer brothers performed in Vienna and the other various Schwarzenberg Palaces, over 20 oboe trios were composed. Phillip Teimer continued to play the cor anglais in Schiknaeder's opera house in Vienna until his death in 1812. He also sang some roles with the company due to his sonorous bass voice. Many cor anglais parts were specially written for him by Stengel, S\u00fcssmayr, Paer, Winter, Weigl, Eberl, Eybler, Salieri, Hummel, Schacht and Fisher.", "Due to the earlier bowed or angular forms it took, the suggestion has been made that anglais might be a corruption of Middle French angl\u00e9 (angular, or bent at an angle, angulaire in modern French),Michael Kennedy, \"Cor anglais\", The Oxford Dictionary of Music, second edition, revised, Joyce Bourne, associate editor (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2006); A.
