It had been definitely published by 46 BC, when Cicero reviewed it and gave it great praise. It is unclear whether the books were released invididually, or all at once. Nipperdey's 1847 account believed that they had been mostly all composed at once in 50 BC. Frank Adcock suggested in 1956 that they had been written in stages, but then published simultaneously. T. P. Wiseman believed they were written and published yearly, as Caesar would have gained enormous utility from keeping the public informed about his exploits. The debate as to the time and nature of publication continues, with critical examination of the evolution of the writing style the chief tool for dating the work. Even if the works were published after the wars, it was clear that Caesar was waging a propaganda campaign during the war, including writing copious letters to his political allies back in Rome. Because of the questionable nature of the war, and threats by his enemies to have him essentially tried for war crimes, winning the public relations battle was critical for Caesar."]}, {"page": "J. B. Bury", "response": ["Bury's writings, on subjects ranging from ancient Greece to the 19th-century papacy, are at once scholarly and accessible to the layman. His two works on the philosophy of history elucidated the Victorian ideals of progress and rationality which undergirded his more specific histories. He also led a revival of Byzantine history (which he considered and explicitly called Roman history), which English-speaking historians, following Edward Gibbon, had largely neglected. He contributed to, and was himself the subject of, an article in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. With Frank Adcock and S. A.

During this time in post-war Germany he contributed to set free Adolf Grimmer from a prison camp, the last Minister of Education in the state of Hanover and a pioneer in the use of film in education. He engaged in friendship with eminent figures, such as Hans Herter and the theoretical physicist Max Planck. The former was a pupil of the school of Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, the same one that his professor at Cambridge Frank Adcock had attended in the 1920s.
