Keyboardist Daz also left and was replaced by Pete White. However, Dean would return for the recording of their fourth studio album, Redimus. This continues along the sound originally heard on Kings of Chaos, with death metal-style guitars, tempos and growls mixed with symphonic black metal keyboards, melodies and grim screaming. There are also elements of progressive tendencies, as evidenced in the title track and \"Morbeea\", an acoustic track heavily influenced by Spanish flamenco music. Jason Mendon\u00e7a of Akercocke guest-stars in this album. Redimus was also the last album by Hecate Enthroned to be released by Blackend; they signed onto a new label, Crank Music Group, in September 2013."]}, {"page": "Mendon\u00e7a", "response": ["*Jason Mendon\u00e7a, British musician"]}, {"page": "Redimus", "response": ["Jason Mendon\u00e7a of Akercocke fame guest-stars on the track \"An Eternal Belief\".", "* Jason Mendon\u00e7a \u2014 backing vocals on \"An Eternal Belief\""]}]}}
