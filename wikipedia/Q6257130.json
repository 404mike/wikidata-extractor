This exhibition was open to the public between noon and 3pm, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Aside from the exhibition, there was a lecture hall, laboratory and library. From here, the museum moved to Leinster House in 1815 when the RDS purchased it from the 3rd Duke of Leinster. Here the Leskean Cabinet continued to be displayed, along with newly accessioned collections from professor of mineralogy and geology, Charles Lewis Giescke, curiosities, and the Hibernicum which was a display of minerals and geological specimens from the island of Ireland.  It was Giescke who first referred to the museum as the \"National Museum of Ireland\", in 1832, in his catalogue of the entomology and ornithology specimens. After Giescke's death in 1833, John Scouler was appointed curator in 1834. During this time the collections were open to public two days a week from noon to 3pm, and to students at all times.

Through Scouler's examination, the fossils represent the second eurypterid to be scientifically studied, just six years after the 1825 description of Eurypterus itself. Five years later, in 1836, British geologist Samuel Hibbert redescribed the same fossil specimens, giving them the name Eurypterus scouleri."]}, {"page": "William McCalla", "response": ["He worked as a plant specimens collector for David Moore, John Scouler and Thomas Coulter."]}, {"page": "Ernest Charles Nelson", "response": ["Since 1996 he has lived in England, originally in Outwell, near Wisbech in west Norfolk, but following the recent death of his wife, in late 2020 he has moved to Sutton St Edmund in South Lincolnshire.
