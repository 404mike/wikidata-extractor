Womersley, p. 11; and The Miscellaneous Works, First edition, vol. 2. From 1759 to 1770, Gibbon served on active duty and in reserve with the South Hampshire Militia, his deactivation in December 1762 coinciding with the militia's dispersal at the end of the Seven Years' War.Womersley, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, pp. 11, 12. Gibbon was commissioned a captain and resigned a lieutenant colonel, later crediting his service with providing him \"a larger introduction into the English world.\" There was further, the matter of a vast utility: \"The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the phalanx and the legion; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.\" Murray, p. 190. The following year, he returned, via Paris, to Lausanne, where he made the acquaintance of a \"prudent worthy young man\" William Guise. On 18 April 1764, he and Guise set off for Italy, crossed the Alps, and after spending the summer in Florence arrived in Rome, via Lucca, Pisa, Livorno and Siena, in early October.Edward Chaney, \"Reiseerlebnis und 'Traumdeutung' bei Edward Gibbon und William Beckford\", Europareisen politisch-sozialer Eliten im 18.Jahrhundert, eds.

He was buried in the Sheffield Mausoleum attached to the north transept of the Church of St Mary and St Andrew, Fletching, East Sussex, having died in Fletching while staying with his great friend, Lord Sheffield. Gibbon's estate was valued at approximately \u00a326,000. He left most of his property to cousins. As stipulated in his will, Sheffield oversaw the sale of his library at auction to William Beckford for \u00a3950.Womersley, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 17\u201318. What happened next suggests that Beckford may have known of Gibbon's moralistic, 'impertinent animadversion' at his expense in the presence of the Duchess of Devonshire at Lausanne. Gibbon's wish that his 6,000-book library would not be locked up 'under the key of a jealous master' was effectively denied by Beckford who retained it in Lausanne until 1801 before inspecting it, then locking it up again until at least as late as 1818 before giving most of the books back to Gibbon's physician Dr Scholl who had helped negotiate the sale in the first place. Beckford's annotated copy of the Decline and Fall turned up in Christie's in 1953, complete with his shattering  critique of the author's 'ludicrous self-complacency ... your frequent distortion of historical Truth to provoke a gibe, or excite a sneer ... your ignorance of oriental languages [etc]'.Edward Chaney, \"Gibbon, Beckford and the Interpretation of Dreams, Waking Thoughts, and Incidents\", The Beckford Society Annual Lectures 2000-2003 (Beckford Society, 2004), pp. 45-47 "]}, {"page": "George Berkeley", "response": ["Shortly afterwards, Berkeley visited England and was received into the circle of Addison, Pope and Steele.

In 1981 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1984.", "A second retrospective was staged at the Tate Gallery in 1994. Critical reviews in London were almost universally negative. British press savagely attacked the Tate exhibit, calling Kitaj a pretentious poseur who engaged in name dropping. Kitaj took the criticism very personally, declaring that \"anti-intellectualism, anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism\" had fueled the vitriol. Despite the bad reviews, the exhibition moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and afterwards to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1995. His second wife, Sandra Fisher died from hyperacute haemorrhagic leuco-encephalitis in 1994, shortly after his exhibition at the Tate Gallery had ended. He blamed the British press for her death, stating that \"they were aiming for me, but they got her instead.\" David Hockney concurred and said that he too believed the London art critics had killed Sandra Fisher.R.

The \"Tate War\" and Sandra's death became a central themes for his later works: he often depicted himself and his deceased wife as angels. In Los Angeles No. 22 (Painting-Drawing) the beautiful young (and naked) girl records the shadow of her aged lover (on whose lap she sits) in a pose directly taken from the Scots Grand Tourist David Allan's Origin of Painting. The latter was included by Ernst Gombrich in his 1995 National Gallery exhibition (and catalogue) on Shadows so that Kitaj would have seen it two years before he left England for ever.Chaney, \"Warburgian Artist\", p. 102"]}, {"page": "Herbert Horne", "response": ["* Edward Chaney and Jane Hall, \u2018Herbert Horne\u2019s 1889 Diary of his first Journey to Italy\u2019, The Walpole Society, LXIV (2002), pp.\u00a069\u2013125"]}, {"page": "Norman Douglas", "response": ["In The Grand Tour and Beyond: British and American Travellers in Southern Italy, 1545\u20131960 (which is chapter 4 of The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance), Edward Chaney wrote that \"the true heir to the great tradition of the 'pedestrian tour'  in our own [20th] century has been 'pagan-to-the-core' Norman Douglas.
