The close cooperation between Hawker, the airframe company, and Bristol, the engine company, was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis as one of the key factors that allowed the development of the Harrier to continue in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.Jefford 2006, p. 23. Rather than using rotors or a direct jet thrust, the P.1127 had an innovative vectored thrust turbofan engine, the Pegasus. The Pegasus I was rated at  of thrust and first ran in September 1959.Jefford 2006, p. 24. A contract for two development prototypes was signed in June 1960 and the first flight followed in October 1960.

During the 1960s, the P.1127 attracted the attention of the RAF; this would eventually result in the development and issuing of Requirement ASR 384, which sought a V/STOL aircraft for ground attack operations.Jefford 2006, p. 13.

Accordingly, in 1968, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) began studies for a simpler aircraft, initially as special project (SP) 117.

However, in May 1957 the team received a supportive letter from Sydney Camm of Hawker Aviation They were looking for a Hawker Hunter replacement. The aircraft designer, Ralph Hooper, suggested having the four thrust vectoring nozzles (originally suggested by Lewis), with hot gases from the rear two. Further joint discussions helped to refine the engine design."]}, {"page": "Hawker Siddeley P.1127", "response": ["Senior project engineer Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft to take advantage of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters (Belgium) to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.Mason 1967, pp. 3\u20134."]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 1960: VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft (most famously the Harrier) invented by Gordon Lewis (1924\u20132010), Ralph Hooper (born 1926), Stanley Hooker (1907\u20131984) and Sydney Camm (1893\u20131966); the project developed on ideas by Frenchman Michel Wibault."]}, {"page": "Heckmondwike Grammar School", "response": ["* John Fozard, took over from Ralph Hooper as the chief designer from 1965 to 1978 of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier"]}, {"page": "List of glider pilots", "response": ["* Ralph Hooper - British aeronautical engineer famous for the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and BAe Hawk"]}, {"page": "Hooper (surname)", "response": ["*Ralph Hooper (born 1926), British aeronautical engineer"]}, {"page": "Lasham Airfield", "response": ["Derek Piggott was Chief Flying Instructor at Lasham during much of the period from 1953 to 1989.

The small available room in the nose for the radar antenna led to low resolution and thus the need for a large warhead to counteract the low accuracy of the weapon."]}]}}
