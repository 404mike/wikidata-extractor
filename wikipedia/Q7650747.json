Although attainder was a common parliamentary weapon for late-medieval English kings, it was effectively a form of outlawry, usually to supplement a common or martial law verdict with the confiscation of land and wealth as its intended result. The scholar Suzannah Lipscomb has argued that not only were attainders increasingly used from the 1530s but that the decade shows the heaviest use of the mechanism in the whole of English history, while Stacy suggests that Henrician ministers resorted to the parliamentary attainder as a matter of routine. Attainders were popular with the King, Lipscomb suggests, because they could take the place of common law rather than merely augment it, \"without needing to cite specific evidence or name precise crimes\". The Roose attainder laid the groundwork for the famous treason attainders that punctuated the rest of Henry's reign."]}, {"page": "Dan Jones (writer)", "response": ["In April 2016 he co-wrote and co-presented, with Suzannah Lipscomb, Henry VIII and His Six Wives, shown on Channel 5.", "In May 2017 he co-wrote and co-presented a three-part docu-drama, Elizabeth I, with Suzannah Lipscomb.
