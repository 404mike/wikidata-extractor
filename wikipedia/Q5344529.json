From 1871 he also undertook the additional responsibility of acting as British consul-general for New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\nArchibald married Catherine Elizabeth Richardson, on 10 September 1834 at Truro, Nova Scotia.

Governor Thomas John Cochrane ordered payments to be made to Mary Travers totalling 85 pounds, 13 shillings, four pence for the use of furniture, coal, wood, candles, services and hire of servants; and 108 pounds, six shillings, eight pence for rental of her premises. These amounts were rejected by the Treasury, but  in November, Cochrane ordered that these accounts be paid from the Military Chest. There is no indication that they were, as Mary Travers again petitioned the House of Assembly for payment in February 1835. The furniture and papers were recovered, eventually, by the government."]}]}}
