He is a former British Army lance corporal, Territorial Army officer and police officer.\nBolton became UKIP leader after winning the party's 2017 leadership election, and gave himself the additional role of Defence spokesman in January 2018. Bolton was removed as party leader in February 2018, following his relationship with a party member, and an ensuing controversy caused over racist comments she had made to a friend about Prince Harry's fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle. Bolton's departure triggered UKIP's fourth leadership election in eighteen months. He subsequently announced plans to establish a new political party, to be called OneNation, that would adopt a Eurosceptic stance like UKIP. The party, under the name Our Nation, was registered with the Electoral Commission on 31 October 2018, but de-registered on 4 November 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["thumb|left|The UKIP logo, used briefly by the party from 2017 to 2018In 2017, Henry Bolton, a former soldier, was elected leader.

In January 2018, UKIP's NEC delivered a vote of no confidence in Bolton; only Bolton voted against the motion. He nevertheless refused to resign. In protest, Margot Parker resigned as deputy leader, as did the party's spokesmen for government, education, immigration, and trade and industry. A few days later, all seventeen UKIP members of Thurrock Council left the party and formed Thurrock Independents.

Among the examples of UKIP representatives and supporters embarrassing the party have been an MEP who called for a ban on the construction of mosques and for all British Muslims to sign a code of conduct, a councillor who suggested that shops should be allowed to refuse service to women and homosexuals, and a council candidate who compared Islam to Nazism and told black comedian Lenny Henry to leave Britain after the latter called for greater ethnic diversity within the UK's creative industries. In 2015, a documentary called Meet the Ukippers filmed activists making racist statements; one said \"the only people I do have a problem with are negroes\". For many years such individuals were internally tolerated within the party, although as part of Farage's push to professionalise the party a number of its members, such as MEP Godfrey Bloom, were expelled for making comments that brought UKIP into disrepute. In 2018, Jo Marney\u2014who was then the girlfriend of the party leader Henry Bolton\u2014was suspended from UKIP after it was revealed that she had sent texts stating that black Africans were \"ugly\".
