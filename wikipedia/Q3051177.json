The Duchess came to visit Eliza in secret. Eliza named her firstborn daughter Georgiana.\nThe name Courtney, extinct since the death of Charles Kelland Courtney in 1761, was derived from her great-uncle, her maternal grandmother's brother, William Poyntz (d. 1809), having married Isabella (d. 1805), sister and co-heiress of the aforementioned Charles Courtney, the last of the west country family of Courtney of Trethurfe and Courtney of Tremeer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 20", "response": ["*1792 \u2013 Eliza Courtney, French daughter of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (d. 1859)"]}, {"page": "Aix-en-Provence", "response": ["*Eliza Courtney (1792\u20131859), illegitimate daughter of the Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey and Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire"]}, {"page": "Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire", "response": ["Despite her unhappiness with her detached and philandering husband and volatile marriage, the duchess, as contemporary norms dictated, was not socially permitted to take a lover without producing an heir. The first successful pregnancy resulted in the birth of Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish on 12 July 1783. Called \"Little G,\" she would become the Countess of Carlisle and have her own issue. The Duchess had developed a strong mothering sentiment since raising Charlotte, and she insisted on nursing her own children (contrary to the aristocratic custom of having a wet nurse). On 29 August 1785, a second successful pregnancy resulted in another daughter: Lady Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, called \"Harryo,\" who would become Countess Granville and also have children of her own. Finally, on 21 May 1790, the duchess gave birth to a male heir to the dukedom: William George Spencer Cavendish, who took the title of Marquess of Hartington at birth, and was called \"Hart.\" He would never marry and became known as \"the bachelor duke.\" With the birth of the Marquess of Hartington, the Duchess was able to take a lover. While there is no evidence of when the Duchess began her affair with Charles Grey (later Earl Grey), she did become pregnant by him in 1791. Sent off to France, the Duchess believed she would die in childbirth. In this spirit, she wrote a letter to her recently born son stating, \"As soon as you are old enough to understand this letter, it will be given to you. It contains the only present I can make you\u2014my blessing, written in my blood...Alas, I am gone before you could know me, but I lov'd you, I nurs'd you nine months at my breast. I love you dearly.\" On 20 February 1792, Eliza Courtney was born without complications to mother and child. The Duchess was forced to give away the illegitimate daughter to Grey's family.
