The Duchess came to visit Eliza in secret. Eliza named her firstborn daughter Georgiana.\nThe name Courtney, extinct since the death of Charles Kelland Courtney in 1761, was derived from her great-uncle, her maternal grandmother's brother, William Poyntz (d. 1809), having married Isabella (d. 1805), sister and co-heiress of the aforementioned Charles Courtney, the last of the west country family of Courtney of Trethurfe and Courtney of Tremeer.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
