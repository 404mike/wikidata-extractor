In the fourth minute, Exeter City's Randell Williams was fouled by Scott Wharton who was shown the first yellow card of the game: the resulting free kick was cleared.  On ten minutes, a long throw-in from Northampton Town's Charlie Goode was cleared by Aaron Martin.  The subsequent throw-in was headed away and fell to Ryan Watson on the edge of the Exeter City penalty area.  He controlled the ball on his thigh, feigned to shoot to send Jake Taylor the wrong way before taking a shot which deflected off Martin's heel past Jonny Maxted in the Exeter City goal.  Four minutes after the restart, Northampton Town won a free kick about  from Exeter City's goal.  The direct shot from Nicky Adams was saved by Maxted and the Exeter City goalkeeper then kept out the follow-up strike.  Vadaine Oliver then headed over the Exeter City crossbar from a Goode cross.  Midway though the first half, play was hallted in order for both teams to take a drinks break.  In the 29th minute, Exeter City's Richardson made a run down the left but the ball went out for a goal kick.  Two minutes later, Northampton Town were forced to make their first substitution of the match:  Adams went off with a leg injury to be replaced by Mark Marshall.  Almost immediately, Morton doubled Northampton Town's lead after converting a flick-on from Jordan Turnbull from a Wharton header.  On 35 minutes, a curling strike from Exeter City's Williams was blocked by Harriman.  Three minutes later, Maxted made the first of several saves and with four minutes of the half remaining, Northampton Town had accumulated six shots on target without reply.  Four minutes of injury time were indicated, and one minute in, Bowman beat the offside trap to run clear, only to trip over before being able to shoot.

That match fuelled City with confidence as they headed to League One side Gillingham for the second round of the FA Cup, and a masterclass in the middle of midfield from Nicky Law, who scored once and provided two assists for Joel Randall, helped Exeter to overcome the Gills 3\u20132 and secure a spot in the third round of the FA Cup for the third time in six seasons and the first time under Matt Taylor as manager.
