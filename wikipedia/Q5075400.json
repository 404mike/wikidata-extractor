His debut performance for England was described as 'decidedly promising'. Brook went on to play for England a total of 18 times, scoring 10 goals. He may have played more times for his country, but faced competition, primarily from Arsenal's Cliff Bastin (who received 21 caps), but also from others, such as Aston Villa's Eric Houghton (who received 7 caps), Sheffield Wednesday's Ellis Rimmer (who received 4 caps) and West Ham's Jimmy Ruffell (who received six caps) and Jackie Morton (who received one cap). However, the versatility of Brook and Bastin meant that they often played together for England, usually with Bastin playing in the inside left position (in a game against Scotland in 1935 Bastin played at inside right). When they played together, Brook and Bastin would interchange at will, switches which often confused opposition defences. p96 Despite the rivalry, Brook and Bastin were in the latter's words 'always the greatest of friends'. The only players to have scored more goals for England, prior to the second world war, who did not play in the centre forward or inside forward positions were Cliff Bastin and Charles Bambridge. Only twelve players in total scored more goals for England than Brook prior to the war. In addition to playing for England, Brook often competed in trial matches for the Rest of England against the national team."]}, {"page": "1850s in association football", "response": ["* 30 July \u2013 Charles Bambridge (d. 1935), England international in 18 matches (scoring eleven goals) from 1879 to 1887."]}, {"page": "1885\u201386 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Charles Bambridge"]}, {"page": "Swifts F.C.", "response": ["The club was founded c.1868 and played home matches on a ground near The Dolphin public house, Slough.
