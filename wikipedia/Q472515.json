Pulses of electric current were sent along wires to control an electromagnet in the receiving instrument. Many of the earliest telegraph systems used a single-needle system which gave a very simple and robust instrument. However, it was slow, as the receiving operator had to alternate between looking at the needle and writing down the message. In Morse code, a deflection of the needle to the left corresponded to a dit and a deflection to the right to a dah. By making the two clicks sound different with one ivory and one metal stop, the single needle device became an audible instrument, which led in turn to the Double Plate Sounder System."]}, {"page": "May 22", "response": ["*1783 \u2013 William Sturgeon, English physicist and inventor, invented the electromagnet and electric motor (d. 1850)"]}, {"page": "1850", "response": ["* December 4 \u2013 William Sturgeon, English physicist, inventor (b. 1783)"]}, {"page": "1832", "response": ["* The first commutator DC electric motor, capable of turning machinery, is demonstrated by William Sturgeon in London."]}, {"page": "North West England", "response": ["Sir Ernest Marsden (of Blackburn) and Hans Geiger conducted the Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment at the University of Manchester in 1909, where the Geiger counter was invented, which demonstrated the existence of the atomic nucleus.

Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Amp\u00e8re's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of Dominique Fran\u00e7ois Jean Arago finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.", "* 1835 \u2013 Joseph Henry invents the electric relay, which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch.

He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire.

The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and bankrupted Davenport. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors, but all encountered the same battery cost issues.

Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 19th Century , xxii, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, . His first electromagnet was a horseshoe-shaped piece of iron that was wrapped with about 18 turns of bare copper wire (insulated wire didn't exist yet). The iron was varnished to insulate it from the windings. When a current was passed through the coil, the iron became magnetized and attracted other pieces of iron; when the current was stopped, it lost magnetization. Sturgeon displayed its power by showing that although it only weighed seven ounces (roughly 200 grams), it could lift nine pounds (roughly 4 kilos) when the current of a single-cell power supply was applied. However, Sturgeon's magnets were weak because the uninsulated wire he used could only be wrapped in a single spaced out layer around the core, limiting the number of turns."]}, {"page": "Solenoid", "response": ["In the study of electromagnetism, a solenoid is a coil whose length is substantially greater than its diameter.or equivalently, the diameter of the coil is assumed to be infinitesimally small (Amp\u00e8re 1823, p. 267: \"des courants \u00e9lectriques formants de tr\u00e8s-petits circuits autour de cette ligne, dans des plans infiniment rapproch\u00e9s qui lui soient perpendiculaires\").

Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make a more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time, for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz; however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.Jerry Marion, Classical Electromagnetic Radiation, Second Edition, p. 107 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9kKHPlcNm2kC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=marion+4.7+classical+electromagnetic+radiation&source=bl&ots=pkOrqBIQS7&sig=XqV_NtcKrDLB4eeBzNShPiLH340&hl=en&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBGoVChMIpNOG-bHyxwIVBAjbCh0npg39#v=onepage&q&f=false"]}, {"page": "East India Company College", "response": ["*William Sturgeon lectured on science in 1824."]}, {"page": "Induction coil", "response": ["Michael Faraday discovered the principle of induction, Faraday's induction law, in 1831 and did the first experiments with induction between coils of wire.
