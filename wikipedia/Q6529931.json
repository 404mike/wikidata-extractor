A play-in game between the eighth and ninth place teams was created, and during his five years as the N.C. State coach after its addition, Robinson's Wolfpack played in the play-in game four out of five times (finishing seventh in 1992 and avoiding the game). Because of his team's traditional appearance in the Thursday night game, the game was referred to as the \"Les Robinson Invitational\" by ACC fans. The play-in game was discontinued when the ACC expanded to include Miami and Virginia Tech, and required three Thursday games."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["Horton's next move was to become assistant to former Brighton teammate Mark Lawrenson, now rookie manager at Second Division Oxford United in May 1988. Lawrenson left the Manor Ground in October 1988 after star player Dean Saunders was sold to Derby County without his consent, and the board elected Horton as his replacement; at the time both Derby and Oxford were owned by members of Robert Maxwell's family. The million pound fee for Saunders allowed Horton to build a squad of his own: former Brighton teammate Steve Foster (Luton Town), Wales international Andy Melville (\u00a3270,000 from Swansea City), New Zealand international Ceri Evans (free agent), defensive midfielder Mickey Lewis (part-exchange to Derby for Trevor Hebberd), Jim Magilton (\u00a3100,000 from Liverpool), John Durnin (\u00a3250,000 from Liverpool), and England under-21 international winger Paul Simpson (\u00a3200,000 from Manchester City). He also gave d\u00e9buts to Joey Beauchamp and Paul Kee. Under his leadership Oxford finished the 1988\u201389 Second Division campaign in 17th-place. In preparation for the 1989\u201390 campaign, he exploited the relationship between Derby and Oxford to sign Dave Penney for \u00a3175,000. On the pitch it was a case of deja-vu, as Oxford finished the season in 17th-place, again with 54 points. Hoping to build a promotion winning squad for the 1990\u201391 campaign, he bought Doncaster Rovers defender Les Robinson for \u00a3150,000. The \"Yellows\" finished in tenth-place, eight points off the play-off places."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Les Robinson"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Les Robinson"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Les Robinson"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Les Robinson"]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Les Robinson"]}, {"page": "Christophe R\u00e9my", "response": ["Described as urbane and calm on the ball, Remy missed part of 1997\u201398 due to injury, losing his position to right-back Les Robinson.
