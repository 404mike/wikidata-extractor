He plays as a central defender for Warrington Town.\nNicholas began his career at Liverpool, where he was timed as being faster than England international Michael Owen. Andrew Nicholas was released in the summer of 2003 but was swiftly snapped up by Swindon Town manager Andy King on a one-year contract.Nicholas did not appear in the Swindon first team until October but soon found himself a regular as the Robins earned a place in the Division Two play-offs only to lose narrowly to Brighton & Hove Albion in the semi-finals. During the season a two-year extension to his Swindon contract was offered which he accepted. Injuries and lack of form kept \"Nico\" out of the team in his next season and he spent a month out on loan to Chester City before returning for the remaining fixtures of Swindon's season.He found himself out of the squad at the start of the 2005/06 season, not helped by a poor showing against Oldham Athletic, but Swindon suffered a horrendous run of form which saw King sacked and Iffy Onuora take over as Swindon manager. \"Nico\" found himself back in the starting line-up for the remainder of the season. Nicholas was offered a one-year contract by Onuora at the end of the season but before agreeing terms, Onuora was dismissed as manager and was swiftly replaced by Dennis Wise. Wise felt it was unfair to withdraw the offer and Nicholas signed up for the 2006/07 League Two campaign becoming Swindon's longest serving player in the process.He was released by new manager Maurice Malpas at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, ending his five-year career with Swindon with 6 goals from 141 games in all competitions. He then signed for Rotherham United at the end of August 2008. He spent two seasons in the club, including a loan spell at Mansfield Town. After leaving Rotherham he signed for Barrow of the Football Conference. In May 2011 he was transfer listed by Barrow, but removed from the list in July. He never gained a regular place in the first team squad, and was let go at the end of the 2011\u201312 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy Nicholas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Nicholas"]}, {"page": "List of Swindon Town F.C. players", "response": ["|Andrew Nicholas ||||DF||2003\u201308 ||126||4"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["| Andrew Nicholas"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Andrew Nicholas || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 3"]}, {"page": "Nicholas, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Nicholas"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Andrew Nicholas"]}]}}
