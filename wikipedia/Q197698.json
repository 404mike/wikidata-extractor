During his playing career he played for Cowdenbeath and Heart of Midlothian, making over 300 league appearances for the latter until he was forced to retire due to injury. He also won 16 caps for Scotland and was part of their 1990 FIFA World Cup squad.\nAfter retiring as a player Levein became a manager, working at club level for Cowdenbeath, Heart of Midlothian, Leicester City, Raith Rovers and Dundee United. Levein was appointed Scotland manager in 2009, but he left this position after the team failed to win any of its first four matches in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. He returned to Hearts in 2014 as director of football, then served as their manager from August 2017 to October 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fife", "response": ["* Craig Levein, Scottish former professional footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Scottish Premier League", "response": ["Despite having more resources than other Scottish clubs, the Old Firm experienced difficulty in competing with big clubs from other leagues in terms of transfer fees and player wages due to the SPL's relatively low television revenue. A recurring theme during the existence of the SPL was the prospect of the two clubs leaving the Scottish football set-up to join the English football league system, an Atlantic League with clubs from countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, or forming a new European Super League. While some observers believed the departure of the Old Firm from the Scottish football setup would be detrimental to Scottish football as a whole, others, such as Craig Levein, believed it would benefit Scottish football due to increased competition among the remaining clubs for the SPL title. World football's governing body FIFA ruled out the prospect of any Old Firm move to the English set-up. The duopoly was effectively broken when Rangers entered administration in 2012 and was liquidated after it failed to reach an agreement with creditors. Rangers was relaunched by a new company and were voted into the Scottish Football League Third Division."]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 FA Premier League", "response": ["Just after the start of the 2002\u201303 season, Leicester's relegation (which cost them extensive television revenue) and the cost of their new stadium had created debts in excess of \u00a330\u00a0million, and the club went into administration before being taken over by a new owner.

Before that final game they were two points ahead of Celtic and with a superior goal difference of four goals. However, this strong statistical position was undermined in the run up to the game when several players in the Hearts squad were hit by a viral infection. Craig Levein failed to recover to make the game in Dundee. Celtic were 4\u20130 up away at St Mirren at half time in their final fixture. Thus, at half time the players knew that they would have to deliver a result at Dens Park. Substitute Albert Kidd forced Hearts to concede a corner kick with seven minutes remaining. The in-swinging corner was touched on and fell to Kidd who put Dundee ahead. This was the first goal Hearts had conceded from a corner all season. Hearts now needed an equaliser to win the title. However, Kidd went on a run with the ball from the halfway line down the right wing beating two Hearts players. After then playing a one-two with a teammate on the edge of the Hearts box he finished to score a second with four minutes left. Dundee won 2\u20130. This combined with Celtic winning 5\u20130 against St Mirren meant the top two clubs finished the season on the same number of points. Hearts lost out to Celtic by a goal difference of three.

Suggested as a possible formation for the future of football, the formation sacrifices an out-and-out striker for the tactical advantage of a mobile front four attacking from a position that the opposition defenders cannot mark without being pulled out of position. Because of the intelligence and pace required by the front four attackers to create and attack any space left by the opposition defenders, however, the formation requires a very skilful and well-drilled front four. Due to these demanding requirements from the attackers, and the novelty of playing without a proper goalscorer, the formation has been adopted by very few teams, and rarely consistently. As with the development of many formations, the origins and originators are uncertain, but arguably the first reference to a professional team adopting a similar formation is Anghel Iord\u0103nescu's Romania in the 1994 World Cup Round of 16, when Romania won 3\u20132 against Argentina. The first team to adopt the formation systematically was Luciano Spalletti's Roma side during the 2005\u201306 Serie A season, mostly out of necessity as his \"strikerless\" formation, and then notably by Alex Ferguson's Manchester United side that won the Premier League and Champions League in 2007\u201308. The formation was unsuccessfully used by Craig Levein's Scotland against Czech Republic to widespread condemnation. At Euro 2012, Spain coach Vicente del Bosque used the 4\u20136\u20130 for his side's 1\u20131 group stage draw against Italy and their 4\u20130 win versus Italy in the final of the tournament."]}, {"page": "James McFadden", "response": ["McFadden was substituted at half-time in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualification match against Liechtenstein in September 2010, and was criticised by manager Craig Levein after the game.
