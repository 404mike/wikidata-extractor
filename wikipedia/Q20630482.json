He died of a heart attack at the age of 27, while working in Florence.Sue Chowles, who had a work placement with Flett before working in fashion and later as a fashion academic, has said: \"He would have been more influential than Galliano now...he was the most inspirational pattern cutter, a true genius\". The Independent included John Flett at number 17 in an article about 50 great British fashion moments, saying: \"Flett's last collection in London was exquisite, watery, shimmery and full of ideas\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Galliano", "response": ["In interviews, Galliano has given his full name as Juan Carlos Antonio Galliano-Guill\u00e9n.

The college at this time was, as she described it, a \"hothouse atmosphere\", with a whole raft of students who would go on to influence fashion and popular culture, including John Galliano, John Flett, Stephen Jones, Darla Jane Gilroy, Sade and Chris Sullivan. She began a project with the fashion designer Jeffrey Rogers \u2013 a key supplier of mass market fashion (usually under an eponymous label) to retailers such as Top Shop and Miss Selfridge. This gave students the opportunity to design garments for commercial production. This, as described by Rogers, was an abysmal failure, but he liked working with Brown and invited her to design for him.", "Brown taught many of the next generation of fashion designers during her tenure at Central Saint Martins and later at the Royal College of Art, where she was made a senior fellow in 2011. At Central Saint Martins, this included names such as John Galliano and John Flett, both of whom are credited with pioneering a new form of bias-cutting.  At the RCA, this included names such as the milliner Philip Treacy \u2013 Treacy mentioned her as one of his most influential teachers and said she helped him make the decision to become a milliner rather than a fashion designer."]}]}}
