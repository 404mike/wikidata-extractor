During his time at Kenilworth Road he was plagued with injuries which ultimately stopped his career progressing with Arsenal being one club that was tracking the highly rated young stopper. In his last season at Luton, he joined Chesterfield on loan before being released. He tried his luck overseas before returning for a spell at Hitchin Town and then Barnet.\nHe was signed by Barnet ostensibly to provide cover for Lee Harrison, but broke into the first team in January 2008. He starred as the Bees beat Swindon Town on penalties in an FA Cup third round replay, saving the penalty that won the shootout for Barnet. In the next season he was given the number 1 shirt, but lost his place to Harrison and later Ran Kadoch. After being made available for loan in January 2009, Beckwith handed in his resignation at Barnet, saying he had lost his love for the game, however just a couple of weeks later he was snapped up by Grays Athletic. He made his debut in the 2\u20131 home victory over Altrincham on 7 March 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dean Brill", "response": ["Beginning 2003\u201304 as understudy to Rob Beckwith, Brill made his league debut as a substitute in a 3\u20130 defeat away to Oldham Athletic, after Beckwith had been sent off.
