Barton joined the project in early 2013. The game's E3 demo had sparse, placeholder audio and did not feature any final mixes, which were expected to be completed by November 2013. Barton sought to make the soundtrack \"distinctive\", with several main themes that build through the game. The music was designed \"as commentary\", to not compete with the action. Titanfall being a multiplayer game, Barton produced a large number of tracks to avoid repetition. The sound ranges from \"a very abused hurdy-gurdy to heavy electronics\" to \"Morricone-esque baritone guitars\". Barton emphasized \"taking sounds out of their context\" to match the game's lawless futuristic setting. The two opposing Titanfall teams each have their own musical identities.

Reporting for Polygon at E3, Arthur Gies praised the \"dynamism\" between the Titan's brute force and the pilots' objective-based stealth as the game's greatest asset.

The game won Best Next Generation Console Game and Best Xbox Game at Gamescom 2013.
