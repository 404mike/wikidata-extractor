Dunfermline proceeded to dominate as John Potter and Joe Cardle had shot saved by the keeper Ryan Esson. A slip by Alex Keddie then let Richie Foran past him and his cross was met by a flying header from ex-Raith Rovers player Gregory Tade. However, in the second half, the Pars continued to threaten and Andy Kirk hooked a shot over before Inverness immediately responded with a 25-yard Greg Tansey free-kick that flew a foot wide. Liam Buchanan was then brought down in the box by David Proctor, and he stepped up to take the penalty himself, calmly slotting home to equalise. Right at the end, Shane Sutherland had an effort well saved by the keeper to keep the score level.
