He left his employment there in 1880 to become a full-time professional painter.\nBates was an \"open-air\" rural landscape artist, painting in the Midlands, Scotland and Wales, and abroad in Switzerland and Egypt. His work shows the influence of Benjamin Williams Leader, Joseph Thors and Samuel Henry Baker, and Bates is associated in style with the Birmingham School of artists.\nBates exhibited many works at the Royal Academy, Grosvenor Gallery, Royal Society of British Artists and the New Watercolour Society in London, and at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. His works are currently on display in Liverpool museum, Worcester City Art Gallery & Museum, and several other art galleries.\nHis son, John Noel Bates (fl. 1870\u20131927), who adopted the professional name John Bates Noel, was also a notable landscape painter.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Bates", "response": ["David Bates may refer to:", "* David Bates (English artist) (1840\u20131921), English landscape artist", "* David Bates (American artist) (born 1952), American modernist artist", "* David Bates (footballer) (born 1996), Scottish footballer", "* David Bates (historian) (born 1945), British historian and writer", "* David Bates (physicist) (1916\u20131994),  Northern Irish mathematician and physicist", "* David Bates (poet) (1809\u20131870), American poet", "* David Bates (rugby league) (born 1980), Irish rugby league footballer", "* David Bates (swimmer) (born 1976), Australian open water swimmer", "* David Bates (politician) (1941\u20132017), American politician"]}, {"page": "Royal Worcester", "response": ["Artists and designers who worked for the factory included Thomas Baxter, William Billingsley, John Stinton, David Bates, James Hadley, Christopher Dresser, Charles Baldwin, Harry Davis and Peter Ewence.
