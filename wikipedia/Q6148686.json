Parts in The Bill, Boon, Spooks and New Tricks have ensured a regular stream of work, in addition to plenty of stage performances.\"Her theatre work has included work in Nottingham for Roland Joffe, Leicester and Stoke-on-Trent with Peter Cheeseman, three seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, including a notable production of Richard II, starring Ian Richardson, directed by John Barton.

In the 1990s, Reeltime distributed P.R.O.B.E., a series of four made-for-video movies featuring Caroline John as her Pertwee-era character Liz Shaw.

Jan Chappell played Lisa Deranne, captain of the solar racing yacht Tiger Moth, whose shakedown cruise is interrupted by a Sontaran attack squad furiously searching for a Rutan infiltrator.  Another spinoff, Downtime, featured the return of Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier (Ret.) Lethbridge-Stewart and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, along with Deborah Watling as Troughton-era companion Victoria Waterfield.
