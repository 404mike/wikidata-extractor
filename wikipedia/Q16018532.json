She trained many pilots and instructors while bringing up a young family, sometimes shouting instructions to a family member as she flew past in an open-cockpit glider. For twenty years she was in charge of the British Gliding Association's panel of examiners responsible for British instructor standards and training. She was an avid cross-country pilot and became a member of the British team at World Gliding Championships for many years. Flying from Lezno in Poland in 1961, she broke the British women's distance record with 528\u00a0km. Her books on aviation are still widely admired and sought after. She flew over 150 types of aircraft."]}, {"page": "Lorne Welch", "response": ["He was sent to Stalag Luft III where he assisted in \"The Great Escape\" by building the ventilation pump & fixed links for the tunnel through which 76 prisoners escaped. Later Welch also escaped with Walter Morison during the Delousing Break attempt, planning to steal a German aircraft while wearing fake German uniforms. After two attempts they were re-captured and sent to Colditz. The Colditz Cock glider was already under construction, and Welch performed vital stress calculations. Although the original glider never flew, a replica was successfully flown in February 2000."]}, {"page": "Delousing break", "response": ["Twenty-four officers, escorted by two fake guards (Allied POWs disguised as Germans), left the camp through the main gate to proceed to the neighbouring compound to be deloused. All twenty-six escapees were recaptured, many within hours. Twenty-four of them were returned to the camp, but Flight Lieutenant Lorne Welch and Pilot Officer Walter Morison were sent to Oflag IV-C at Colditz for attempting to steal an aircraft. Flying Officer Henry Birkland RCAF and Flight Lieutenant John Stower also took part in this escape attempt; both were later murdered following the Great Escape in March 1944."]}, {"page": "Dominic Bruce", "response": ["By 1944 escaping was becoming tougher and more risky. Walter Morison explained that by August 1943 most of the loopholes to escape in the castle had been exploited; making escaping even harder. By spring 1944 escaping got more risky. Contrary to the Geneva convention the use of force had been debated inside the German mess for years. Oberstleutnant Prawitt, the Kommandant and Staff Paymaster Heinze were keen on using it on repeat offenders, such as Bruce. As was the Major Amthor, the new second in command, who had joined the mess in May 1943. Amthor was a young keen Nazi and had constantly tried to influence for the use rough measures. Amthor and Prawit were hated by the prisoners that when ever they entered the court yard they were whistled and howled at. P\u00fcpke was not a Nazi and was even given a courteous reception during Appell in the summer of 1944. In late March 1944, Hitler had disregarded the Geneva Convention with regards to POW's. The punishment for escape now carried a punitive risk of execution. Bruce made two further escape attempts in 1944; on 19 April and on 16 June."]}, {"page": "Morison KSi", "response": ["The association is the legacy of Walter MorisonFlight Lieutenant Walter Morison - The Telegraph, 2009 (26 November 1919 - 26 March 2009) a Royal Air Force pilot who became a prisoner of war and was sent to Colditz for attempting to steal an enemy aircraft during the Second World War."]}]}}
