He did not play as regularly this season due to the form of younger player, Matt Jay, who played in a similar position to Law. Despite this, Law still scored some crucial goals in his appearances, such as an equaliser (as well as two assists) against League One Gillingham in the second round of the FA Cup. After he captained the club in a 1\u20130 loss to Carlisle United on 30 January 2021, it was announced that Nicky had the permission of the manager and the board to leave the club before his contract expired, as he had received an offer to join American side Indy Eleven as a player-coach.

Like Coventry, they also faced a Premier League academy side, that of Chelsea. Their opener was against Exeter at the Kassam Stadium in late August. Tyler Roberts opened the scoring for Oxford early in the game and Chris Maguire doubled their lead on 35 minutes with a penalty. Goals from Matt Jay and Liam McAlinden drew the Devon side level, but strikes from Ryan Taylor and Alex MacDonald in the final 20 minutes sealed a 4\u20132 win for United. For their second match on 4 October 2016, they travelled to local rivals Swindon Town. It was an ill-tempered game with six yellow cards issued, two for Swindon and four for Oxford. There was also a straight red card before half time for MacDonald after he stamped on Swindon's Anton Rodgers. The game finished 0\u20130, the drawn fixture leading to a penalty shoot-out. Five of the nine penalties taken were saved, three by Swindon keeper Will Henry and only two by Oxford's Simon Eastwood, resulting in a 3\u20131 shoot-out win and two points for Swindon, with one point for Oxford."]}]}}
