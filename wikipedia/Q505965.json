He left Ballinamallard United for Rangers in 2006, where he turned professional the following year. He made a number of first team appearances in 2009\u201310, but was otherwise limited to youth and reserve team football until he won a loan move to Port Vale in August 2011. He returned to Rangers, and was a key player as they won the Scottish Third Division title in 2012\u201313 and the League One title in 2013\u201314. He signed with Preston North End in June 2014, and was loaned out to Blackpool in November 2015, and Accrington Stanley in March 2016.

With 25 goals in the first six league games, Vale players found scoring goals easy, but the strength of the previous season \u2013 defending \u2013 seemed to have left them. In September, a brace from Rob Taylor and late winner from Pope were enough to beat Bradford City, as Vale climbed into the automatic promotion places. On 22 September 2011, Adams signed free agent Rob Kozluk on a short-term contract until 1 January 2012, and also brought in Liam Chilvers on a month's loan from Notts County (a loan deal later extended to 24 December); both players were signed to bolster Vale's struggling defence. The pair made their d\u00e9buts two days later, as Vale earned a 1\u20131 draw with local rivals Crewe Alexandra at the Alexandra Stadium \u2013 Pope finding an equaliser just two minutes after Byron Moore gave the \"Railwaymen\" the lead.", "However, after scoring in all of their first fifteen league and cup games, a 4\u20130 home defeat by Morecambe sent the \"Valiants\" down to eleventh place; in doing so the \"Shrimps\" avenged the 7\u20132 defeat inflicted upon them at the Globe Arena on the penultimate day of the 2010\u201311 season. Andrew Little returned to parent club Rangers after the game, having damaged his knee ligaments during the defeat. Mike Green also left the club after asking to have his contract terminated following a loan spell at Eastleigh. After a run of five games without a win \u2013 which included 388 minutes without scoring a goal \u2013 Adams signed Cameroonian striker Guy Madjo and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams on loan from Stevenage, as well as Irish defender Shane O'Connor on loan from Ipswich Town. The two Stevenage loanees scored a goal a piece against struggling Dagenham & Redbridge on 10 December, to give the Vale their first win in more than six weeks. Supporters showed their disapproval against the board by displaying red cards in the home fixture against Aldershot Town, a game in which Madjo scored a hat-trick. Following this match, both Roe and McDonald were signed until the end of the season, whilst Kozluk was released. On 30 December, midfield playmaker Gary Roberts had his contract terminated following two serious breaches of club discipline in the space of three months. Nominated for the Manager of the Month award for three wins in four December games, Adams revealed that due to the club's precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in the January transfer window \u2013 despite the chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets.
