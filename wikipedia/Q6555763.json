By dawn the following day the battalion was just north of the Rotterdam to Arnhem railway line.

The defenders from the 9th SS Panzer Division had been here for two days and were well dug in.Peters, p.173 Casualties were heavy and brigade headquarters obtained permission to withdraw south of the rail line into Oosterbeek. The battalion started to pull back but found most of their intended new positions already occupied by the Germans and by 15:00 had lost communications with brigade. To cross back over the rail line the battalion first had to capture the crossing point at Wolfheze.Peters, p.174 Just before the attack a diversion was provided by the arrival of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigades gliders. Unaware the landing-zones had been captured or were under fire 10 percent of the Poles were killed during the landings.Peters, p.183 The battalion withdrew remaining in contact with the advancing German tanks and infantry and under mortar fire.
