J. Davies, was a Welsh economist, industrialist, prize winning essayist, author, political activist, pilot, and an internationalist. Davies was a world traveller before returning home to Wales.\nInitially a founding member of the Welsh Labour Party in the Ammanford district, in 1925 he left Labour becoming a founding member of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party of Wales.According to the historian John Davies, it was D. J. Davies' ideas which were more influential in shaping long-term Plaid Cymru ideology following the Second World War, and Davies was as \"equally [a] significant figure\" as Saunders Lewis in Welsh nationalism history, but it was Lewis' \"brilliance and charismatic appeal\" which was firmly associated with Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru of the 1930s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of works published posthumously", "response": ["* David James Davies \u2014 Towards Welsh Freedom"]}, {"page": "David Davies", "response": ["*David James Davies (1893\u20131956), Welsh economist, industrialist, political activist and internationalist"]}, {"page": "1956 in Wales", "response": ["*11 October \u2013 David James Davies, economist and politician, 63"]}, {"page": "1949 in Wales", "response": ["*David James Davies - Towards an Economic Democracy"]}, {"page": "1893 in Wales", "response": ["*2 June \u2013 David James Davies, economist, industrialist and writer (died 1956)"]}]}}
