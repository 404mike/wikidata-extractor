Holland had fallen under the revolutionary government of France and a British force under General Sir James Henry Craig was sent to Cape Town to secure the colony from the French for the Prince of Orange, a refugee in England. The governor of Cape Town at first refused to obey the instructions from the Prince, but when the British proceeded to take land troops to take possession anyway, he capitulated. His action was hastened by the fact that the Khoikhoi, escaping from their former enslavers, flocked to the British standard. The burghers of Graaff Reinet did not surrender until a force had been sent against them; in 1799 and again in 1801 they rose in revolt. In February 1803, as a result of the peace of Amiens (February 1803), the colony was handed over to the Batavian Republic which introduced many reforms, as had the British during their eight years' rule. One of the first acts of General Craig had been to abolish torture in the administration of justice. The country still remained essentially Dutch, and few British citizens were attracted to it. Its cost to the British exchequer during this period was \u00a316,000,000. The Batavian Republic entertained very liberal views as to the administration of the country, but had little opportunity to enact them."]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* General Sir James Henry Craig (1748\u20131812), British military officer and colonial administrator"]}, {"page": "Isaac Brock", "response": ["In 1807 Brock was appointed brigadier generalIn British practice of the time brigadier general was not a permanent rank but an appointment of colonels or lieutenant colonels for a specific purpose or period of time by Governor General Sir James Henry Craig, the new commander of Canadian forces.

In June 1811 he was promoted to major general and in October of that year Lieutenant Governor Francis Gore left for England. Brock was sent to Upper Canada as senior officer commander of the troops and senior member of the [executive] council, putting him fully in charge of both the military and civil authority. He was usually referred to as president of the council or administrator of Upper Canada (never as lieutenant governor). When permission to leave for Europe finally came in early 1812, Brock declined the offer, believing he had a duty to defend Canada in war against the United States.Tupper (1847) pp. 108\u2013109"]}, {"page": "History of the Cape Colony before 1806", "response": ["The Netherlands fell to the French army under the leadership of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte in 1795.

He also feared that if the United States tried to invade Lower Canada, the Canadian Party would collaborate. In 1810, Craig imprisoned journalists working for the newspaper Le Canadien.
