Hore was one of the earliest English canal engineers, and Sir Alec Skempton wrote that he was \"in the first rank among the navigation engineers\". The Hutchinson Chronology of World History described his work on the Kennet navigation as \"[setting] a new standard for inland waterways, and is an important forerunner of the canals of the Industrial Revolution\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "River Avon, Bristol", "response": ["The Bristol Avon Navigation, which runs the  from the Kennet and Avon Canal at Hanham Lock to the Bristol Channel at Avonmouth, was constructed between 1724 and 1727, following legislation passed by Queen Anne, by a company of proprietors and the engineer John Hore of Newbury.

However, in 1715, work was authorised to make the River Kennet navigable from Reading to Newbury. Work commenced in 1718, under the supervision of surveyor and engineer John Hore of Newbury. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened, comprising stretches of natural riverbed alternating with  of artificially created lock cuts.", "The River Avon had historically been navigable from Bristol to Bath, but construction of watermills on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure. In 1727, navigation was restored, with the construction of six locks, again under the supervision of John Hore. The first cargo of \"Deal boards, Pig-Lead and Meal\" reached Bath in December."]}, {"page": "Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation", "response": ["Prior to the actual construction of the navigation, there had been almost 120 years of proposals for such a scheme, and opposition from the port of Maldon, which anticipated that its revenues would fall if vessels could travel to Chelmsford. The first such scheme was proposed in 1677 by Andrew Yarranton, who published his idea in a work entitled England's Improvements by Sea and Land. Maldon objected and the scheme came to nothing. In July 1733, John Hore, who was involved in the Kennet, Stroudwater, and the Avon Navigation at Bristol, proposed two schemes, one to make the river navigable, and another to create a new cut between Chelmsford and Maldon. Despite the projected extra costs for a canal, Hore favoured the canal scheme, as he believed there would be less objection from the millers along the river route. Maldon again objected on commercial grounds, and the scheme was dropped."]}, {"page": "History of the British canal system", "response": ["Some 29 river navigation improvements took place in the 16th and 17th centuries.Burton, (1995).
