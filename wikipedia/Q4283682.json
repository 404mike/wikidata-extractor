(1929-2013) was a South African botanist and plant collector.Wessel was born in Colesberg, Northern Cape Province, on 28 December 1929, the youngest of the ten children of Barend Pieter Marais, the last blacksmith and wagon builder of Colesberg, who was of French Huguenot descent. He studied at Pretoria University (1947-1951) where he obtained an M.Sc. in Botany for the thesis 'A Morphological study of an indigenous species of rice, Oryza barthii A. Chev.'. He then (1952) joined the National Herbarium (PRE) where he undertook fieldwork during an internship in Kruger National Park and in Namibia. From 1953 to 1955 he was director of the Albany Museum Herbarium (GRA) in Grahamstown, where he studied South African Cruciferae for the Flora of Southern Africa. He carried out collecting trips to the Southwestern Cape Province, Natal, Lesotho, the Transkei, Pondoland, Griqualand East and other localities. He collected over 1,500 specimens jointly with Van der Schijff in the Kruger National Park and with Bernard de Winter in northern S.W. Africa.\n\nHe was the South African Liaison Officer at Kew Gardens (1957-1965). He then worked in the nursery trade before joining the permanent staff at the Herbarium, Kew, in 1968, initially as Senior Scientific Officer and later Principal Scientific Officer. In 1970 he became Curator of Petaloid Monocots.At Kew he contributed to and edited the Flore des Mascareignes; he wrote the account for Tulipa for the Flora of Turkey and Romulaea for Flora Europaea. He collected in Turkey and R\u00e9union.\nOne of his more unusual contributions was the identification of Pilea peperomioides, the 'Chinese Money Plant', and he kept a plant on the window sill of his office.He took early retirement from Kew in 1986 because of arthritis. He lived in Lasvaux, Cazillac in France where he died, 27 January 2013, in a care home in Martel, Lot.Crotalaria damarensis Engl. var. maraisiana Torre, Heliophila maraisiana Al-Shehbaz & Mummenhoff, and Polyscias maraisiana Lowry & G.M.Plunkett were named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gastonia (plant)", "response": ["Polyscias maraisiana has been the subject of some nomenclatural instability. In 1984, Wessel Marais separated it from Gastonia cutispongia as Gastonia mauritiana.Wessel Marais. 1984. \"Notes on Mascarene Araliaceae\". Kew Bulletin 39(4):809-816. In 2003, it was shown that the correct name for this species was Gastonia elegans because it had first been described in 1866 as Terminalia elegans. This description was a large and unexpected taxonomic error because Terminalia is in the Myrtalean family Combretaceae. In 2010, when this species was transferred to Polyscias, the specific epithet had to be changed again because the names Polyscias mauritiana and Polyscias elegans already existed. The latter two are in the Polyscias subgenera Grotefendia and Tieghemopanax, respectively."]}, {"page": "Gladiolus murielae", "response": ["The species was first described as Acidanthera bicolor by Christian Hochstetter in 1844. In 1973, Wessel Marais included the genus Acidanthera in Gladiolus. As the name Gladiolus bicolor had already been published by John Gilbert Baker in 1877 for a different species of Gladiolus, Marais needed another name. He chose to call the species Gladiolus callianthus. Marais was apparently unaware that James Kelway had already published the name Gladiolus murielae in 1932, so that the name \"G. callianthus\" was superfluous. The epithet murielae honours Muriel Erskine; her husband had collected in Ethiopia the specimen on which Kelway based the name."]}, {"page": "List of authors of South African botanical taxa", "response": ["*Wessel Marais (1929-) S ........

It was formerly grown as an ornamental in Europe, partly on account of its strikingly heteroblastic leaves, however it is rarely found in international cultivation now.
