Foden has acknowledged that one real-life figure who contributed to the character Garrigan was English-born Bob Astles, who worked with Amin. Another real-life figure who has been mentioned in connection with Garrigan is Scottish doctor Wilson Carswell. Like the novel on which it is based, the film mixes fiction with real events to give an impression of Amin and Uganda under his rule. While the basic arc of Amin's rule is followed, the events in the film depart from both actual history and the plot and characters in Foden's novel."]}, {"page": "List of people from Ashford, Kent", "response": ["* Bob Astles (1924\u20132012), former associate of Ugandan presidents Milton Obote and Idi Amin; born in Ashford\"Guilt by association?\", BBC HARDtalk, Bob Astles interviewed by Tim Sebastian on 7 January 2004."]}, {"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*Bob Astles (born 1924) \u2013 associate of Ugandan presidents Milton Obote and Idi Amin"]}, {"page": "List of white Africans of European ancestry", "response": ["*Bob Astles, soldier and colonial officer"]}, {"page": "Makindye Prison", "response": ["*Bob Astles was imprisoned for seventeen weeks in the prison during 1972, transferred to Luzira Maximum Security Prison and released in 1985.

When Amin ordered the expulsion of Asians from Uganda, Maliyamungu was placed on a committee to oversee the distribution of their wealth, taking much for himself. He was also involved in coffee smuggling, shipping large amounts of coffee with boats from Uganda across Lake Victoria to Kenya. President Amin ordered his British advisor Bob Astles to clamp down on Maliyamungu's smuggling operations in 1978. According to Indian diplomat Madanjeet Singh, Maliyamungu responded by kidnapping and torturing Astles him before releasing him."]}, {"page": "Invasion of Kagera", "response": ["On 5 November, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi cautiously appealed for Uganda to withdraw its troops \"if\" they had violated Tanzania's border. The following day, representatives of the OAU flew to Kampala to speak with Amin and try and reach a solution. Moi also told Amin that he would be willing to act as a mediator between Uganda and Tanzania. The Ugandan Government offered to accept mediation from Libya, one of its allies, but Tanzanian officials dismissed the proposal. Nyerere was exasperated by the suggestion that he accept mediation, telling OAU diplomats on one occasion, \"How do you mediate between somebody who breaks into your house and the victim of the assault?\" OAU chairman Edem Kodjo privately confided to a British official that Nyerere was determined to fight Uganda and that mediation was useless. The OAU ultimately refrained from condemning the Ugandan invasion. Nyerere appealed to Kenya to halt shipments of fuel to Uganda, but his request went unheeded. Amin's close adviser, Bob Astles, told Indian diplomat Madanjeet Singh that he had visited Moi in Kenya who had given him assurances that \"Kenya shall give Uganda every transit facility that we need, and that he will tell President Nyerere not to interfere in Uganda's internal affairs.\""]}, {"page": "Faruk Malik", "response": ["According to journalists Martha Honey and David B. Ottaway, Malik was a \"Zanzibari of Pakistani origin\". Indian diplomat Madanjeet Singh concurred, describing him as Pakistani national. In contrast, one of Amin's advisors, Bob Astles, claimed that Malik was a \"Pakistani/British Asian\" and \"London friend\" of his."]}, {"page": "Nubians (Uganda)", "response": ["Experts such as Paul Nugent have argued that the Ugandan Nubians are hard to define, as they are \"an extremely fluid category\". The Nubians were traditionally regarded by Europeans and many Ugandans as the descendants of Emin Pasha's mostly Muslim slave soldiers who fled to Uganda after being defeated by Mahdist Sudanese forces in the 1880s. Accordingly, the name \"Nubian\" or \"Nubi\" stems from the historical region of Nubia in northern Sudan. As the Nubians were seen as martial people by the British and preferred as recruits for the British colonial army, many northern Ugandans adopted a Nubian identity when they intended to join the military. This trend continued after Uganda's independence, especially under the rule of President Idi Amin who favored Nubians in the Uganda Army. Amin himself stated that members of different tribes could become Nubians. Migrants from neighboring Sudan who enlisted in the Uganda Army adopted a Nubian identity, although native Ugandan Nubians in Bombo, Kitgum, and Gulu resented them as foreign mercenaries. According to expert Mark Leopold, the Nubian identity was an \"elective, strategic, and potential alternative ethnicity\" for people from the West Nile region before 1979. Even Amin's British advisor Bob Astles adopted the traditional Nubian scars."]}, {"page": "Foreign support of Uganda in the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War", "response": ["The relations between Uganda under Amin and Kenya experienced significant ups-and-downs from 1971 to 1979. Despite occasional tensions, however, the two countries maintained strong trade. Amin's hostility to Tanzania was beneficial to Kenya, as Kenyan leaders opposed Tanzania's socialist orientation. Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi concluded in 1978 that the overthrow of Amin would primarily benefit ex-President Milton Obote whom the Kenyan leadership deeply distrusted. As a result, according to journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey, the Kenyan government provided Amin with \"support [...] literally until just before Tanzanian troops marched into Kampala\". Conversely, political scientist Chris Ikalikha Musambayi characterised Moi's response to the war vis-\u00e0-vis Amin's regime as marked by \"ambiguity\", which the Tanzanians interpreted as support for Uganda. Shortly after the outbreak of war, Nyerere appealed to Kenya to halt shipments of fuel to Uganda, but his request went unheeded. Amin's close adviser, Bob Astles, told Indian diplomat Madanjeet Singh that he had visited Moi in Kenya who had given him assurances that \"Kenya shall give Uganda every transit facility that we need, and that he will tell President Nyerere not to interfere in Uganda's internal affairs.\" Kenyan authorities disrupted efforts of Ugandan exiles to organise in their country, arresting some guerillas and in a few instances turned them over to the Ugandan government. At the beginning of 1979 the Kenyan government restricted the movement of all Ugandan nationals in and out of the country. In February, Amin publicly requested five countries, among them Kenya, to diplomatically intervene in the war and convince Tanzania to stop its invasion. In March Ugandan exiles attempted to leave the country to meet with others in Tanzania for a rebel unity conference but were detained at the border. The Kenyan government soon thereafter released them in Nairobi but refused to allow them to travel to the meeting, citing its \"neutrality\" in the war. In 1980, The Ugandan Times, a newspaper overseen by Uganda's post-Amin government, accused Moi's government of aiding Amin during the war. The accusation was negatively received in Kenya."]}]}}
