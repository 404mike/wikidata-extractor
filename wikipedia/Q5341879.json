They promised to have a railroad at work in three weeks after landing at Balaclava. The offer was accepted and the contractors began to obtain supplies, to purchase or hire ships, and to recruit the men, who included specialists and navvies. The vessels engaged to carry the railway material and men consisted of seven steam and two sailing ships, of the aggregate tonnage of 5491 tons, and 900-horse power, as follows - \"Lady Alice Lambton,\" screw-steamer, 511 tons, 90-horse power; \"Great Northern,\" ditto, 578 tons, 90-horse ; \"Earl of Durham,\"  ditto, 554 tons, 90-horse; Baron von Humboldt,\" ditto, 420 tons, 60-horse; \" Hesperus,\" ditto. 800 tons, 150-horse; \" Prince of Wales,\" ditto, 627 tons, 120-horse ; \"Levant,\" paddle-steamer, 694 tons, 500-horse power; \"Wildfire,\" clipper sailing ship, 457 tons; Mohawk,\" ditto, 850 tons.
