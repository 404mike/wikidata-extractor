Just 17 minutes into the match, Charlton's captain and centre half, Derek Ufton was taken to hospital after he landed awkwardly from a challenge and dislocated his shoulder.  With no substitutes allowed, Charlton were forced to play another 73 minutes with ten men.  Huddersfield took control of the match.  Les Massie pierced the leaky Charlton defence to score the first goal for Huddersfield at 27 minutes.   Eight minutes later, Alex Bain added a second.  Charlton managed to keep Huddersfield at bay until half-time, and so trailed 2\u20130 at the break.
