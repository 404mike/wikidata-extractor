During his research career, he was highly active in the study of dynamical systems, and, in particular, ergodic theory, and made significant contributions to these fields. He is considered to have been at the forefront of the introduction of ergodic theory to the United Kingdom. He played a founding role in the study of subshifts of finite type, and his work on nilflows was highly regarded.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dyadic transformation", "response": ["The dyadic transformation provides an example of how a simple 1-dimensional map can give rise to chaos.
