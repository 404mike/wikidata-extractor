He was Nuffield Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Oxford, where his work and publications on peripheral nerve injuries gained him an international reputation. His classification of nerve injuries forms the basis of that in use into the 21st century. He went on to become director of the new Institute of Orthopaedics in London and subsequently the first Professor of Orthopaedics in the University of London. In this role he directed basic science research into orthopaedic conditions and developed postgraduate training in orthopaedic surgery. He was President of the British Orthopaedic Association, and was knighted in 1964 for services to orthopaedics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital", "response": ["*Sir Herbert Seddon (1903\u20131977), orthopaedic surgeon and author of Surgical Disorders of the Peripheral Nerves"]}, {"page": "Seddon (surname)", "response": ["* Sir Herbert Seddon (1903\u20131977), British orthopaedic surgeon and nerve researcher"]}, {"page": "Honor Smith", "response": ["Smith began her medical career at the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in London. She then moved to Oxford, where she worked for Herbert Seddon's peripheral nerve injury unit. She began working for Hugh Cairns's neurosurgery unit at the Radcliffe Infirmary in 1943, where she started her lifelong body of research on meningitis. Here, she pioneered the use of intrathecal penicillin to treat pneumococcal meningitis. She undertook a research fellowship at the Boston Children's Hospital with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation in 1948; she received an MD in the same year after returning to Oxford."]}, {"page": "J. I. P. James", "response": ["In 1948 James was appointed as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon to the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital  and was awarded a Rockefeller scholarship to gain orthopaedic experience in the United States. He acted as assistant director to Mr (later Sir) Herbert Seddon and together they arranged orthopaedic training programmes which were to gain national and international reputations. He was appointed in 1958 to the chair of orthopaedic surgery at the University of Edinburgh, which involved clinical and teaching responsibilities for elective cases at the Princess Margaret Rose Hospital and for emergency admissions at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. He organised a regional orthopaedic service for Lothian and established training programmes which attracted trainees from around the world. He believed in structured specialist training. As chairman of the Specialist Advisory Committee in Orthopaedics he persuaded the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh to establish an exit examination toward the end of higher surgical training in orthopaedics (FRCSEd (Orth), which subsequently became the Intercollegiate Specialty Fellowship in 1990 and was subsequently adopted as the norm for all surgical specialties in the United Kingdom and Ireland. His clinical and research interests were in the surgery of the hand and the surgical treatment of scoliosis."]}, {"page": "Herbert John Seddon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Seddon"]}]}}
