In an article in The Independent, Deborah Orr writes that the organisation came into being when, \"after reading some of his anti-immigration letters in The Times\", the then Sir Andrew approached David Coleman, Professor of Demography at Oxford University, and they subsequently set up MigrationWatch.", "After the British government reacted to the Hong Kong national security law, announcing that British National (Overseas) passport holders in Hong Kong would be given the right to live, study and work in the UK and would be offered a route to route to citizenship, MigrationWatch published a paper stating that \"a Home Office factsheet confirmed that the number who might eventually be able to come is up to 2.9 million \u2013 the current number of BNOs residing in Hong Kong\". The paper argued that the government had \"cast the proposed offer of a pathway to citizenship as part and parcel with the UK honouring its 'historical responsibilities'\", suggesting that this set a dangerous precedent. Chris Whitehouse, responding to the MigrationWatch paper in an article for CapX, argued that \"the UK's historic duty towards Hong Kong is very different to other former colonies; and the future of Hongkongers is based on China keeping its word, which it is brazenly failing to do\". He concluded that \"Lord Andrew Green and Migration Watch are out of step with the nation on this one, and they should urgently consult Lord Patten on their route ahead if they are not to lose their way\".", "Similarly, an article by Dean Godson of the centre-right think tank Policy Exchange published in The Times in June 2006 states: \"The dramatic change in the terms of the immigration debate over recent months is largely down to the determination and courage of a single individual \u2013 Sir Andrew Green, the founder and chairman of MigrationWatch UK. Almost single-handedly, he has rescued the national discourse from the twin inanities of saloon-bar bigotry on the Right and politically correct McCarthyism on the Left\".", "In 2007, the Daily Mirror paid damages to Andrew Green after columnist Brian Reade likened him and the group to the Ku Klux Klan and Nazi Party, which the paper admitted was \"untrue\".", "In August 2010, Sally Bercow, a Labour Party Prospective Parliamentary Candidate and wife of Conservative MP John Bercow, argued on a Sky News newspaper review that a Daily Express article based on MigrationWatch research was \"oversimplifying\" and constituted \"dangerous propaganda\". As a result, MigrationWatch and Andrew Green threatened to take libel action against Bercow. After she instructed the lawyer David Allen Green to defend the threatened action, MigrationWatch dropped its threat. According to a MigrationWatch press release, in the light of an assurance by her lawyer that Mrs Bercow \"did not intend to (and did not) allege that Migrationwatch is a fascist or racist organisation\", the organisation decided not to take the matter further."]}, {"page": "Strangers into Citizens", "response": ["Panorama included comments by Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, and Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch, who repeated their opposition to the idea.", "* , TrueTube debate between Dr Austen Ivereigh (Strangers into Citizens campaign) and Sir Andrew Green (MigrationWatch)", "*   Andrew Green, 'This would make a bad situation worse', the Daily Telegraph (10 May 2007)"]}, {"page": "Andrew Green", "response": ["Andrew Green may refer to:", "*Andrew Green, Baron Green of Deddington (born 1941), former British diplomat and anti-immigration activist", "*Andrew Green (Formula One), Formula One engineer", "*Andrew Green (ghost hunter) (1927\u20132004), British ghost hunter", "*Andrew Green (Jersey politician), Deputy for St Helier 3 & 4 District, Jersey", "*Andrew Green (librarian), Welsh librarian", "*Andrew Green (MP) for Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)", "*Andrew Greene (born 1969), Canadian Football League offensive tackle"]}, {"page": "British Syrian Society", "response": ["Its co-chair Sir Andrew Green, a former British ambassador to Syria, resigned after emails showed Dr Akhras had advised Assad on how to rebut evidence of civilians apparently being tortured.Robert Verkaik  Josie Ensor  Patrick Sawer \"Revealed: How Britain\u2019s former Syria ambassador appeared on BBC to defend Assad... after quietly taking a job with dictator\u2019s father-in-law\", The Daily Telegraph 22 April 2017 Dr Akhras had used a private email channel to the Syrian leader to offer advice on how the Syrian government should handle criticism of its suppression of the opposition uprising, including how to counter video footage appearing to show the torture of children.Robert Verkaik  Josie Ensor  Patrick Sawer \"Revealed: How Britain\u2019s former Syria ambassador appeared on BBC to defend Assad... after quietly taking a job with dictator\u2019s father-in-law\", The Daily Telegraph 22 April 2017Ian Black \"Assad's father-in-law under pressure to quit British Syrian Society\" Guardian 22 March 2012"]}, {"page": "Lord Green", "response": ["* Andrew Green, Baron Green of Deddington (born 1941), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "2014 Special Honours", "response": ["* Sir Andrew Green,  to be Baron Green of Deddington, of Deddington in the County of Oxfordshire - 2 December 2014"]}, {"page": "Baron Green of Deddington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Green, Baron Green of Deddington"]}, {"page": "Lord Green of Deddington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Green, Baron Green of Deddington"]}, {"page": "Andrew Green (diplomat)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Green, Baron Green of Deddington"]}, {"page": "Steve Moxon (whistleblower)", "response": ["Moxon subsequently wrote a book, The Great Immigration Scandal, which was published by Imprint Academic in August 2004.

A Conservative Party spokesman reported that Davis \"had agreed to go provisionally and talk in favour of Steve as a whistleblower. But that was before he saw the contents of the book. He then felt unable to attend\". According to The Guardian, the book \"claims the term 'paki' is not racist; predicts immigration leading to Ulster-style civil war; and Asians are more likely to be organised criminals\". Labour MP Frank Field reviewed the book for the Sunday Times, describing it as a \"slow-burn Molotov cocktail on immigration\". It received positive endorsements from commentators including Andrew Green of MigrationWatch UK and David G. Green of Civitas. Academic Neil Lunt, reviewing the book in the journal Political Studies Review, gave it one star and wrote that: \"Scandals are everywhere and doomsday scenarios litter the text. There is a lack of clear and judicious argument: referencing is highly selective, and there are frequent sweeping and unsupported statements. Moxon fails to convey an understanding of many issues including structural discrimination, the 1951 Refugee Convention and Britain's relationship to Empire. In some places the text is well written; in others it resembles a teenager's diary. Further, alongside the now familiar caricatures of migrant scroungers, there were also inappropriate and offensive references vis-\u00e0-vis women, disability and race\"."]}]}}
