The leading conservative, Economic Development Minister Ian Smith, was sacked from Cabinet for disloyalty in March 1981. He was reinstated after pledging loyalty to Hamer, but resigned again in May. It was apparent by this stage that Hamer had lost the support of his party. He resigned in June, and was succeeded by Deputy Premier Lindsay Thompson. The following month he resigned from Parliament, and was knighted, becoming Sir Rupert Hamer. At the ensuing by-election, Prue Sibree retained his seat for the Liberals. At the election the following year the Liberals were defeated after 27 years in power."]}, {"page": "Nawa-I-Barakzayi District", "response": ["In 2009 the Taliban began moving even more men into Nawa, possibly for additional attacks against Lashkar Gah.  On May 13, they launched an attack against the Afghan National Police in the district, that overwhelmed several posts.  By late spring they had established a solid foothold in the district. On July 2, 2009, Marines from the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines (1/5) occupied the district as part of Operation Strike of the Sword.  They set up their headquarters in Forward Operating Base Geronimo.  On August 26, Lance Corporal Donald Hogan, a Marine with 1/5, threw himself in front of an improvised explosive device (IED), saving the Marines in his squad.  He was later posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions.  In December, 1/5 was replaced by 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines. In the late summer and early fall the Marines detained Haji Adam, one of Nawa's main drug lords, and turned his house into Combat Outpost (COP) Sullivan. In November two local officials were assassinated. On December 17, Admiral Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited Patrol Base Jaker and touted the security gains by touring the Nawa district center without wearing body armor.  Several weeks later Afghan President Hamid Karzai and ISAF commander General Stanley McChrystal also visited Nawa on January 2, 2010.  On January 9 British journalist Rupert Hamer and two Marines were killed by an IED in the district."]}, {"page": "List of Old Greshamians", "response": ["*Rupert Hamer \u2013 journalist killed in Afghanistan"]}, {"page": "Hamer (surname)", "response": ["* Rupert Hamer (1916\u20132004), Australian Liberal Party politician, Premier of Victoria 1972\u201381", "* Rupert Hamer (journalist) (1970\u20132010), British war correspondent killed in Afghanistan "]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*10 January \u2013 the Sunday Mirror defence correspondent Rupert Hamer was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence confirmed.", "**Rupert Hamer, journalist (b. 1970)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2010", "response": ["*Rupert Hamer, 39, British journalist, defence correspondent for the Sunday Mirror, improvised explosive device."]}, {"page": "List of journalists killed during the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)", "response": ["|||Rupert Hamer ||Nawa, Nawa-I-Barakzayi District, Helmand Province||The British Sunday Mirror war correspondent and his photographer were traveling with US troops when their vehicle hit an IED.
