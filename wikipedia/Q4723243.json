The local unions disagreed over whether to negotiate wages as part of a \"sliding scale\", where pay rose and fell in line with coal export prices.  This began to change in 1892, when the unions formed a joint committee.  Its initial members were William Abraham, David Beynon, Thomas Davies, Daronwy Isaac, J. Jones, David Morgan, Alfred Onions and Morgan Weeks from the sliding scale districts, and David Ajax, John Davies, J. Edwards, Joseph Phillips and M. Williams from the non-sliding scale districts.
