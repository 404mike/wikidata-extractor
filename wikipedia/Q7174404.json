In April 1973 he played his last game for Wednesday, before joining Brighton and Hove Albion, then managed by Brian Clough on loan after Brighton had been beaten 8-2 by Bristol Rovers in front of the TV cameras. However, despite losing 4-1 on his debut against Tranmere Rovers Grummitt made over 100 league appearances for the Seagulls before joining Worthing F.C..He was capped on three occasions by England under-23 between 1961 and 1963.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)", "response": ["Clough was appointed as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4\u20130 at home to Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8\u20132 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973\u201374 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodeve; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and spent too much time away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975\u201376, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976\u201377 and then into the top-flight in 1978\u201379."]}, {"page": "PFC Cherno More Varna", "response": ["Cherno More had its moments of glory in a friendly against Ajax which ended in a 3\u20131 win on 8 June 1966, with goals from Zdravko Mitev (2) and Stefan Bogomilov. The 19 year old Johan Cruyff scored for Ajax.http://sportnabiblioteka.bg/images/download/Football/4_24.pdf In August 1966 the team from Varna visited England and played three matches. The most memorable was the 1\u20130 win against Nottingham Forest on City Ground. Nottingham fielded a strong side with Peter Grummitt, Bob McKinlay, Alan Hinton, Henry Newton, Joe Baker, Terry Hennessey, Jeff Whitefoot in the starting 11. The match was decided with a long range shot from defender Dimitar Bosnov in the first half.http://www.retro-football.bg/sites/default/files/books/futbol_71.pdf p. 59 Nottingham Forest was to end the 1966-67 season as runners-up in the Football League First Division. The other two matches ended in a 1\u20131 draw against Coventry City after Stefan Yanev had opened the score, and a 1\u20132 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday F.C.. After 16 years in the top flight, Cherno More was relegated in 1976 and won promotion the following season.  A new generation of players was emerging. Defenders Todor Marev and Ivan Ivanov, midfielders Todor Atanasov and Ivan Andreev, forwards Rafi Rafiev and Nikola Spasov left many good memories in the late 70s and the 80s. In the 1981\u201382 season, the team finished 4th and therefore qualified for the Intertoto Cup. Cherno More won twice 2\u20130 at home against Standard Li\u00e8ge and the Danes from Hvidovre IF and drew 1\u20131 against Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Away, they drew 1\u20131 in Denmark and lost 1-3 and 0\u20133 in Li\u00e8ge and Leverkusen respectively. Later in the 80s, Cherno More was relegated twice and played 3 seasons in \"B\" RFG.

Two years after joining Forest he was a member of their 1958\u201359 FA Cup winning team. Forest were 2-0 up after 14 minutes. Luton Town hit back midway through the second half after Forest's opening goalscorer Roy Dwight broke his leg in the 33rd minute. Forest had further personnel issue when cramp reduced Bill Whare to little more than a hobbling spectator. Thomson helped Forest protect their 2\u20131 lead to lift the trophy at Wembley. Thomson was replaced as the Forest goalkeeper by Peter Grummitt in November 1960. He remained at Forest until 1961, making 136 appearances."]}, {"page": "McIntyre, Treadmore and Davitt", "response": ["* Let's Not - caravan holidays, acid Peter Grummitt, footballer, the Highway Code, Norfolk, Godzilla, Diss, Jack Kerouac's On the Road, folk song \"One man went to mow\", author Carla Lane, grindcore, Vanburn Holder (cricketer), Jesus, Grant Baynham, (occasional contributor to That's Life!).
