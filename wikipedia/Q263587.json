NRC scientist Nestor Burtnyk had heard an animator from Disney explain the traditional animation process, where a head animator draws the key cels and assistants draw the fill in pictures. The work of the artist's assistant seemed to Burtnyk to be the ideal demonstration vehicle for computer animation and within a year he programmed a \"key frame animation\" package to create animated sequences from key frames. The NFB in Montreal was contacted so that artists could experiment with computer animation. Foldes made a 1971 experimental film involving freehand drawings called Metadata. This was followed by Hunger, which took him and his NRC partners a year and a half to make.", "Category:Films directed by Peter Foldes"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["|Peter Foldes"]}, {"page": "Peter Fold\u00e8s", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Foldes"]}, {"page": "History of computer animation", "response": ["The National Film Board of Canada, already a world center for animation art, also began experimentation with computer techniques in 1969.\"Retired NRC Scientists Burtnyk and Wein honoured as Fathers of Computer Animation Technology in Canada\".

This film comprised drawings animated by gradually changing from one image to the next, a technique known as \"interpolating\" (also known as \"inbetweening\" or \"morphing\"), which also featured in a number of earlier art examples during the 1960s.From \"The Film Animator Today: Artists Without A Canvas\"  (retrieved April 22, 2012) In 1974, Foldes completed Hunger / La Faim, which was one of the first films to show solid filled (raster scanned) rendering, and was awarded the Jury Prize in the short film category at 1974 Cannes Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award nomination.", "The terms inbetweening and morphing are often used interchangeably, and signify the creating of a sequence of images where one image transforms gradually into another image smoothly by small steps. Graphically, an early example would be Charles Philipon's famous 1831 caricature of French King Louis Philippe turning into a pear (metamorphosis).Charles Philipon's 1831 caricature of Louis Philippe turning into a pear (retrieved July 27, 2012). \"Inbetweening\" (AKA \"tweening\") is a term specifically coined for traditional animation technique, an early example being in E.G.Lutz's 1920 book Animated Cartoons.Online copy of E.G.Lutz's book Animated Cartoons, 1926 ed, Charles Scribner's Sons, see p 179 (retrieved July 27, 2012). In computer animation, inbetweening was used from the beginning (e.g., John Whitney in the '50s, Charles Csuri and Masao Komura in the '60s). These pioneering examples were vector-based, comprising only outline drawings (as was also usual in conventional animation technique), and would often be described mathematically as \"interpolation\". Inbetweening with solid-filled colors appeared in the early '70s, (e.g., Alan Kitching's Antics at Atlas Lab, 1973, and Peter Foldes' La Faim at NFBC, 1974), but these were still entirely vector-based."]}, {"page": "A Short Vision", "response": ["A Short Vision is a British animated film by Joan and Peter Foldes released in 1956.
