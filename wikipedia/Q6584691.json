The sport of cricket had acquired most of its modern features by this time and the period saw the establishment of roundarm bowling as an accepted practise.\nCounty cricket clubs began to become more formally established during this period and Sussex County Cricket Club, the oldest professional sporting organisation in the world, was formerly established in 1839. This would soon be followed by formal organisations in other counties, although the County Championship was not formally established until 1890.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1726 and 1840 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Argent (disambiguation)", "response": ["Argent is the heraldic tincture of silver.", "Argent may also refer to:", "* Argent (band), a 1960s\u20131970s British rock band", "** Argent (album), a 1970 album by the band", "** Rod Argent (born 1945), keyboardist and founding member of The Zombies and Argent", "* Argent (comics), a DC Comics fictional superheroine", "* Argent (TV channel), a defunct Canadian French-language cable channel", "* Argent Corporation, a defunct hotel/casino company in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.", "* Argent Ventures, a privately held real estate company based in New York City", "* Argent LLP, a UK property developer; see King's Cross Central", "* Argent Mortgage, a unit of the defunct American company Ameriquest Mortgage", "* Argent (surname)", "* Argent (Middlesex cricketer), 19th-century English cricketer", "* Argent Centre, a historic building in Birmingham, England", "* Argent-sur-Sauldre, a commune in France", "* Argenta (disambiguation)", "* L'Argent (disambiguation)", "* Montagne d'Argent, a hill in north-east French Guiana"]}, {"page": "Argent (surname)", "response": ["Argent is a surname of unclear origin.
