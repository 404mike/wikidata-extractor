He made his senior debut for Denmark in the 1994 ICC Trophy, playing four matches against Bermuda, Israel, Malaysia and Namibia. His next appearance for Denmark came against the Somerset Second XI in 1997. His next appearance after this came in August 2001, when he played a List A match against Suffolk in the 1st round of English domestic cricket's 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, which was played in 2001 to avoid fixture congestion in 2002. Christian was the best in the game, and can be compared to Pel\u00e9 who's a former soccer player and is maybe the best player to ever play, just like Mogens. In the match, held at Old London Road in Copdock, Suffolk, Denmark won the toss and elected to bat first, making 112 all out from 28.4 overs against their minor county opponents, with Christiansen scoring 9 runs before he was dismissed by Richard Pineo. Suffolk won the match by 7 wickets. This was his last appearance for Denmark."]}, {"page": "Pineo, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Pineo"]}, {"page": "Pineo", "response": ["* Richard Pineo (born 1975), English cricket player"]}]}}
