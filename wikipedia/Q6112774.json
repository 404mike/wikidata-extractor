Although originally a centre forward, he developed his skills as a winger too. It was in the latter position that he made  his league debut, scoring in a 5\u20130 victory over Wrexham in August 1950. He scored six goals in his first six first-team games. With winger Jack Grainger already established in the Millers team, White's appearances were limited, but in 1952 an injury to centre forward Jack Shaw, led to Grainger being switched to the central striker role, and White again playing as a winger. He was in great form and was selected for the FA national team in fixtures against the Army and the RAF. Those FA representative games brought him to the attention of the First Division clubs and he joined Newcastle United in 1953 for \u00a312,500 - a relatively high amount at the time. The signing of White came following two recent FA Cup successes for Newcastle.
