He studied at Queens' College, Cambridge. After graduation, he spent from 1967 to 1973 as a freelance journalist, first in Malawi, then in Uganda. He then joined the BBC as a foreign correspondent. He worked there for 25 years. He is the author of several books, among them the biographies of Mao Zedong, Mao: A Life published in 1999, Mao: The Man Who Made China in 2017, Pol Pot, Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare, and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, A Taste for Intrigue: The Multiple Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand.\nHe presented a TV documentary on Mao Zedong entitled \"Mao's Bloody Revolution Revealed\" on the UK terrestrial station Five in May 2007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Khmer Rouge", "response": ["There are three interpretations of the Khmer Rouge: totalitarianism, revisionism, and postrevisionism. Historian Ben Kiernan describes their rule as totalitarian but places it within the context of \"xenophobic European nationalism\", from which came their agrarianism and the establishment of a Great Cambodia, rather than communism or Marxism. Pol Pot's biographers David P. Chandler and Philip Short place more emphasis on their ideological heritage of communism; it was not easy to apply Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin's ideas to Cambodia, and communism was chosen as a way to get rid of French colonialism and transform the feudal society. Another interpretation, as proposed by historian Michael Vickery, is that of a bottom-up, left-wing peasant revolution with the Khmer Rouge as the revolutionaries. The Khmer Rouge was an intellectual group with a middle-class background and a romanticised sympathy for rural poor people but with little to no awareness that their radical policies would lead to such violence; according to this view, the applicability of genocide is rejected and the violence was an unintentional consequence that was beyond the Khmer Rouge's control. For Vickery, communist ideology does not explain the violence any more than those closer to the peasants', such as agrarianism, populism, and nationalism. Vickery wrote of communisms, as different communist factions were opposed to each other and fought against each other, resulting in further escalation of violence."]}, {"page": "Mao Zedong", "response": ["In Shanghai, suicide by jumping from tall buildings became so commonplace that residents avoided walking on the pavement near skyscrapers for fear that suicides might land on them. Some biographers have pointed out that driving those perceived as enemies to suicide was a common tactic during the Mao-era. In his biography of Mao, Philip Short notes that Mao gave explicit instructions in the Yan'an Rectification Movement that \"no cadre is to be killed\" but in practice allowed security chief Kang Sheng to drive opponents to suicide and that \"this pattern was repeated throughout his leadership of the People's Republic\".", "Others, such as Philip Short in Mao: A Life, reject comparisons by saying that whereas the deaths caused by Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia were largely systematic and deliberate, the overwhelming majority of the deaths under Mao were unintended consequences of famine. Short stated that landlord class were not exterminated as a people due to Mao's belief in redemption through thought reform, and compared Mao with 19th-century Chinese reformers who challenged China's traditional beliefs in the era of China's clashes with Western colonial powers. Short writes that \"Mao's tragedy and his grandeur were that he remained to the end in thrall to his own revolutionary dreams. ... He freed China from the straitjacket of its Confucian past, but the bright Red future he promised turned out to be a sterile purgatory. In their 2013 biography, Mao: The Real Story, Alexander V. Pantsov and Steven I. Levine assert that Mao was both \"a successful creator and ultimately an evil destroyer\" but also argue that he was a complicated figure who should not be lionised as a saint or reduced to a demon, as he \"indeed tried his best to bring about prosperity and gain international respect for his country.\""]}, {"page": "Pol Pot", "response": ["Pol Pot was born in the village of Prek Sbauv, outside the city of Kampong Thom.

French colonial records placed his birth date on 25 May 1928, but biographer Philip Short argues he was born in March 1925.", "In re-interpreting the revolutionary role of classes and questioning the Marxist focus on the proletariat, Pol Pot embraced the idea of a revolutionary alliance between the peasantry and the intellectuals, an idea that Short linked to his reading of Peter Kropotkin while he was in Paris. Contrary to the principles of historical dialectics, he believed that peasants could develop a proletarian consciousness as an effect of the communist party's education of the masses, which resembles orthodox Marxist\u2013Leninist thought. In addition to that, Philip Short maintained that \"the grammar of Theravada Buddhism permeated\" Pol Pot's thought as much as Confucianism had influenced the development of Maoism in China."]}, {"page": "French protectorate of Cambodia", "response": ["Unlike in Vietnam, Cambodian nationalism remained relatively quiet during much of French rule mostly due to lesser education influence, which helped literacy rates remain low and prevented nationalist movements like those taking place in Vietnam.

The suppression of counter-revolutionaries targeted mainly former Kuomintang officials and intellectuals who were suspected of disloyalty.

Keng Vannsak explained to him that the other ones wanted to get rid of him. Short quoted him: \"They knew that I was not the tough kind like them. I thought too much. I was not a stubborn person and did not act with fanaticism nor like an extremist. Ieng Sary, a former high school classmate who later became Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Khmer Rouge government himself told me later: 'You are too sensitive. You will never be a politician. In order to make politics, you have to be tough. You will not get there, brother. You are too sentimental'\".", "Keng Vannsak became one of the key figures of the Cambodian student community in Paris. As described by historian Philip Short in his book titled \"Pol Pot \u2013 Anatomy of a Nightmare\", during the winter of 1950, more exclusive student meetings took place several times every month at Keng Vannsak's flat in Paris \u201cto discuss political issues and more precisely about the future of Cambodia, a country which, for the first time, was directly affected by the war in Vietnam\u201d. The historian explains that the meetings was the beginning of Saloth Sar's political training and more involvement into the Khmer political affairs.", "Philip Short also details that at that time communism was not their main concern, and recalls that Vannsak himself was more aware of political reality than most of his fellow-students. Vannsak appeared to offend a young Frenchwoman of the high bourgeoisie by offering her, a year before, to go and spend the afternoon at the F\u00eate de l'Humanit\u00e9, organised by the French Communist Party."]}, {"page": "Early life of Mao Zedong", "response": ["Mao's father, Mao Yichang, had been born in Shaoshanchong to a family of poverty before undergoing an arranged marriage to Mao's mother, Wen Qimei, when he was fifteen years old. While Yichang had received two years of schooling and could read and write, conversely Qimei was illiterate. Serving for several years in the regional Xiang Army, Yichang saved up his wages and on leaving the army used these to pay off his family's debts and purchase the lands that his father had sold. By the time of Zedong's birth, Yichang owned two-and-a-half acres of rice paddy, which would have been considered a substantial amount by the standards of the region. Through frugal living and hard work, over the coming years he was able to purchase a further acre and employ two farm laborers, with his farm encompassing a cow shed, a grain storage hut, a pigsty, and a small mill. Expanding the family's wealth, Yichang purchased mortgages on other peasants' land, thus becoming their landlord, while also purchasing the grain from the poorest farmers in the village before selling it on for a profit at the county seat of Xiangtan. In doing so, he amassed a fortune of two to three thousand Chinese silver dollars at a time when the majority of China's peasantry continued to live in poverty. This being the case, Mao biographer Philip Short could assert that the Mao family were \"comfortably off\" by the standards of the period. But other historians point out that where an average peasant might have eaten meat one meal in a year, Mao\u2019s family will only have done so one meal in a month.", "Despite this education, biographers Alexander Pantsov and Steven Levine commented that the \"moral-ethical precepts of Confucius seem to have left not a trace in his soul\". Conversely, biographer Philip Short asserted that for Mao, as for all Chinese children who went underwent traditional education, these Confucian texts \"fixed the underlying pattern of [his] thought for the rest of his life\". Short went so far as to suggest that Confucianism would prove to be \"at least as important to [Mao] as Marxism\", noting that even in later life, Mao's speeches contained a greater number of quotations from Confucius and other ancient Chinese philosophers than from major Marxist theoreticians Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin."]}, {"page": "Khmer nationalism", "response": ["Unlike in Vietnam, Cambodian nationalism remained relatively quiet during much of French rule mostly due to lesser education influence, which helped literacy rates remain low and prevented nationalist movements like those taking place in Vietnam.

While landlords had no protection, those who were branded \"rich peasants\" received moderate protections from violence and those who were on the lower end were fully protected. In this vein, Mao insisted that the people themselves, not the secret police's security organs, should become involved in enacting the Land Reform Law and killing the landlords who had oppressed them, in contrast to the Soviet practice of dekulakization. Mao thought that peasants who killed landlords would become permanently linked to the revolutionary process in a way that passive spectators could not be.", "Estimates for the number of deaths range from a lower estimate of 200,000 to 800,000, and higher estimates of 2,000,000Lee Feigon.
