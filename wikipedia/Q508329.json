B. Priestley and directed by Rudolph Cartier. Priestley's script had begun life as a potential screenplay for a feature film, and condensing it down to Out of the Unknown's standard running time of fifty minutes proved impossible. In the end, Shubik convinced the management of the BBC to allow \"Level Seven\" to run to sixty minutes as a one-off exceptional measure. Reviewing \"Level Seven\" in The Listener, J. C. Trewin said, \"the tension was inescapable, the excitement incontestable, more so, undoubtedly, than other thrusts into the future\".Ward, Out of the Unknown, p. 198.
