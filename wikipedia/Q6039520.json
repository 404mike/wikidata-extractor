After a second salvo from the rocket battery, many of the rebels fled and the mosque was finally taken by storm. When Forbes-Mitchell entered the enclosure he found only numerous dead defenders.

His patrons included high ranking naval officers, powerful businessmen, and members of Parliament.  Several upper crust boxing students and alumni from Cambridge University were boxing students of Langham when he lived in Cambridge and may have remained supporters of his club.  Tom Sayers found a worthy adversary to box and spar with at the club when his career was flagging.  Morning boxing matches for purses were staged in the club and sometimes in remote spots closer to Epsom, and were often preceded by lengthy late night meals followed by the Club's prized plum pudding.  Bouts inside the club sometimes featured boxers fighting in the nude, for the unique tastes of some of the aristocratic patrons.  Meals were famously consumed inside a regulation 24 square foot boxing ring, despite the tight fit as Langham acted as Master of Ceremonies.  Aristocratic patrons included James Grimston, known as Lord Verulam, a former member of both the House of Lords and Commons, Lord Caledon, and Admiral Lord Edward Russell.  Other wealthy patrons included Lord Robert Grimston, brother of James, Sir Robert Peel, amateur boxer and son of the Prime Minister, and Robert's brother Royal Navy Captain William Peel, also an accomplished amateur boxer.  Other distinguished patrons included Royal Navy Commander William Hope-Johnstone and Brown and Harris of the London Stock Exchange.  Jem Mace claimed to have once boxed Archibald William Douglas (1818-1856), the 8th Marquess of Queensbury, known as (Viscount Drumlanrig) at the Club.  Douglas had served as a former member of the House of Commons and was the father of John Douglas, credited with helping to establish boxing's modern Marquess of Queensberry Rules.List of patrons, location and details of the club in Thormanby, (1900) Boxers and their Battles; Antecdotal Sketches and Personal Recollections, London, R.
