Coming to prominence in the early 1970s with the band Cochise, Cole has played in many styles, ranging from mainstream pop and rock to jazz and eclectic experimental music, but has never forgotten the instrument's roots in country music.

The band then played gigs in mainland Europe, but, on 7 June, a post-show bust-up at D\u00fcsseldorf-Philipshalle left McCabe with a broken hand and Ashcroft with a sore jaw. After this, McCabe decided he could not tolerate the pressures of life on the road any longer and pulled out of the tour, leaving the band's future in jeopardy, with rumours of a split circulating in the press. Despite this, the band continued with session guitarist B. J. Cole replacing McCabe, whose guitar work was also sampled and triggered on stage. The band played another American tour, which was riddled with problems as venues were downsized and support act Massive Attack dropped out. The band then returned to England for two headline performances at the V Festival, which received poor reviews, with NME stating \"where songs used to spiral upwards and outwards, they now simply fizzle tamely.\" In February 1999, \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The Verve played their last gig at Slane Castle in Ireland on 29 August. A long period of inactivity followed. Finally, in April 1999, it was announced that The Verve had again split up.", "* B. J.

Produced by Gilmour along with Phil Manzanera and Chris Thomas, the album features orchestrations by renowned Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner, and lyrics principally written by Gilmour's wife Polly Samson.
