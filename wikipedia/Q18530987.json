Illustrations were rarely included. The periodical would feature several book reviews, with the leading article being a book review occupying two or three pages. Feature sections included \"Original Correspondence\" and a social column as well as notice of theatre productions. An \"Original Poetry\" section consisted of work sent in by the public, the poets being called \"Correspondents\", as well as some work by staff writers. Advertisements filled the last two pages, which were used by publishers to publicise books. The magazine also occasionally featured news of subjects of interest such as archaeological discoveries, inventions, art exhibitions, architecture and the sciences. William Paulet Carey and Walter Henry Watts acted as art critics."]}, {"page": "List of art critics", "response": [":*Walter Henry Watts"]}]}}
