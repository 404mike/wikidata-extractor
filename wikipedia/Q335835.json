He is a Labour Party member of the House of Lords. He was Professor of Political Theory at the University of Hull from 1982 to 2001, and Professor of Political Philosophy at the University of Westminster from 2001 to 2009. He served as president of the Academy of Social Sciences from 2003 to 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jawaharlal Nehru", "response": ["According to Bhikhu Parekh, Nehru can be regarded as the founder of the modern Indian state. Parekh attributes this to the national philosophy Nehru formulated for India. For him, modernisation was the national philosophy, with seven goals: national unity, parliamentary democracy, industrialisation, socialism, development of the scientific temper, and non-alignment. In Parekh's opinion, the philosophy and the policies that resulted from this benefited a large section of society such as public sector workers, industrial houses, middle and upper peasantry. However, it failed to benefit the urban and rural poor, the unemployed and the Hindu fundamentalists."]}, {"page": "Mahatma Gandhi", "response": ["According to Bhikhu Parekh, three books that influenced Gandhi most in South Africa were William Salter's Ethical Religion (1889); Henry David Thoreau's On the Duty of Civil Disobedience (1849); and Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894). Ruskin inspired his decision to live an austere life on a commune, at first on the Phoenix Farm in Natal and then on the Tolstoy Farm just outside Johannesburg, South Africa. The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism, Christianity and Jainism, states Parekh, with his thoughts \"in harmony with the classical Indian traditions, specially the Advaita or monistic tradition\".", "Gandhi called for ending poverty through improved agriculture and small-scale cottage rural industries. Gandhi's economic thinking disagreed with Marx, according to the political theory scholar and economist Bhikhu Parekh. Gandhi refused to endorse the view that economic forces are best understood as \"antagonistic class interests\". He argued that no man can degrade or brutalise the other without degrading and brutalising himself and that sustainable economic growth comes from service, not from exploitation. Further, believed Gandhi, in a free nation, victims exist only when they co-operate with their oppressor, and an economic and political system that offered increasing alternatives gave power of choice to the poorest man."]}, {"page": "Socialism", "response": ["In The Concepts of Socialism (1975), Bhikhu Parekh identifies four core principles of socialism and particularly socialist society, namely sociality, social responsibility, cooperation and planning. In his study Ideologies and Political Theory (1996), Michael Freeden states that all socialists share five themes: the first is that socialism posits that society is more than a mere collection of individuals; second, that it considers human welfare a desirable objective; third, that it considers humans by nature to be active and productive; fourth, it holds the belief of human equality; and fifth, that history is progressive and will create positive change on the condition that humans work to achieve such change."]}, {"page": "Multiculturalism", "response": ["Bhikhu Parekh counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities \"demanding special rights\" and to see these as promoting a \"thinly veiled racis[m]\". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact \"not about minorities\" but \"is about the proper terms of the relationship between different cultural communities\", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., \"the principles of justice\" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come \"through an open and equal dialogue between them.\""]}, {"page": "Equal opportunity", "response": ["The substantive position was advocated by Bhikhu Parekh in 2000 in Rethinking Multiculturalism, in which he wrote that \"all citizens should enjoy equal opportunities to acquire the capacities and skills needed to function in society and to pursue their self-chosen goals equally effectively\" and that \"equalising measures are justified on grounds of justice as well as social integration and harmony\".Parekh, Bhikhu, Rethinking Multiculturalism. Cultural Diversity and Political Theory, pp. 210\u201311, 240, London: Macmillan Press, 2000 Parekh argued that equal opportunities included so-called cultural rights which are \"ensured by the politics of recognition\"."]}, {"page": "Tessa Blackstone, Baroness Blackstone", "response": ["* Race Relations in Britain with Bhikhu Parekh and Peter Saunders (Routledge, 1997)"]}, {"page": "Runnymede Trust", "response": ["In 1997, Runnymede established the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain to consider the political and cultural implications of the changing diversity of the UK.
