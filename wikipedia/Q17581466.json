The second casting announcement was met with backlash from a section of the Sandman fanbase, with some criticizing the casting of black actors, like Howell-Baptiste as Death, as characters traditionally depicted as white in the comics. Mehrul Bari of The Daily Star felt that while the backlash against the casting announcement was clearly \"rooted in flagrant phobias\", some of the casting choices seemed like \"stunt casting\" that continued tokenism in Netflix productions and comic book adaptations. For example, Bari noted that aside from Death, the rest of the Endless, including Dream, were still played by white actors. Gaiman dismissed the backlash and suggested that fans critical of casting the non-binary actor Park as Desire had not actually read the Sandman comics (in which Desire is androgynous)."]}, {"page": "Paranormal (TV series)", "response": ["Directed by Amr Salama and joined by Majid Al Ansari, late author Ahmed Khaled Tawfik's book series comes to life in this adaptation, starring Ahmed Amin, Reem Abd El Kader, Samma Ibrahim, Razane Jammal, and Aya Samaha.
