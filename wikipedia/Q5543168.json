He took 127 wickets in that season and passed the 100 wickets mark in each of the next five seasons, with a best performance of 156 wickets in 1934, when he was top of the first-class averages. He was picked as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1935 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.\nIn 1934-35, he was chosen, with his county colleague Eric Hollies, for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of the West Indies and there he played his only Test matches. He took more wickets, 17, than any other England bowler and also hit the highest score, 49, in England's innings of 226 in the third Test match, having been sent in as a nightwatchman. But the tour as a whole was not a success, with the West Indies winning the four-match series by two to one, and Paine was not picked for any further Test matches.\nIn fact, in 1935, though he still took more than 100 wickets, Paine was much less effective for Warwickshire; Wisden for 1936 says that he \"suffered from physical trouble\", which appears to have been rheumatism, and that he had lost much of the flight and spin that had made him a force since 1931. He was ill for much of 1936, back but out of form in 1937 and after another ineffective season in 1938, he refused the terms Warwickshire offered for 1939 and left first-class cricket, though he reappeared in one match in 1947.\nIn retirement he was a coach at Solihull School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 30", "response": ["*1978 \u2013 George Paine, English cricketer and coach (b. 1908)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  George Paine"]}, {"page": "1934 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Stan McCabe, Bill O\u2018Reilly, George Paine, Bill Ponsford, Jim Smith"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["*    George Paine"]}, {"page": "Birmingham and District Premier League", "response": ["* George Paine"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["George Paine \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Jack Iddon", "response": ["Iddon's Test cricket was confined to the 1934-35 tour to the West Indies, when he played in all four Test matches, and one match against the South African cricket team in 1935.

In the first match of the 1935 series, he again batted at No 7, scored 29 and bowled four overs for three runs.

He appeared first in eight matches in the 1933 season, and \"showed real promise\", according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's review of the season, though he did not reach 50 in any innings. He was again an irregular player in 1934, but at the start of the 1935 season he played a match-saving innings of 105 not out and shared a seventh wicket partnership of 199 with Tom Dollery, who also made his maiden century, in the game against Gloucestershire; the partnership remains in 2015 Warwickshire's highest for that wicket against Gloucestershire. He did not manage to build on this start to the season, however, although his fielding was exceptional: the South African Cyril Vincent dropped his bat and stood to applaud the catch Collin took to dismiss him at square leg in the touring team's game at Edgbaston. He was not successful in the 1936 season and at the end of the year he left the Warwickshire staff."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* George Paine (1934/35) : G.
