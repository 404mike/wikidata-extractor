In a closely reasoned argument using statistics from therapeutic radiation, exposure to elevated natural radiation (the presence of radon gas in homes) and the diseases of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors he demonstrated that the linear no-threshold model should not be applied to low-level exposure in humans, as it ignores the well-known natural repair mechanisms of the body."]}, {"page": "Wade allison", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wade Allison "]}, {"page": "Wade (given name)", "response": ["* Wade Allison (born 1941), British physicist and Oxford professor"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (W)", "response": ["*Wade Allison"]}, {"page": "Pro-nuclear movement", "response": ["* Wade Allison, Emeritus Fellow of Keble College, Oxford.
