Abel played for Falkirk, Clydebank and Alloa Athletic.\nAfter retiring as a player, he became a coach at Alloa Athletic and then Falkirk, assisting Alex Totten. Abel was appointed Falkirk manager in November 1983, after Totten left the club to become assistant manager of Rangers. He resigned in February 1984 due to the pressures of combining that job with working as a schoolteacher. Abel assisted Jim Leishman as Dunfermline Athletic rose from the Scottish Second Division to the Scottish Premier Division with successive promotions in 1985\u201386 and 1986\u201387. Abel left Dunfermline in July 1987 after the club converted to fully professional status, however, because he wanted to retain part-time status and continue his teaching career.After leaving Dunfermline, Abel became assistant manager of Forfar Athletic. Later that year, Abel was appointed manager of Alloa Athletic. The club won a promotion under his management and reached the quarter-finals of the 1988\u201389 Scottish Cup. Abel was sacked by Alloa Athletic in February 1990 as the club struggled in the Scottish First Division, having won promotion the season before.Abel then worked as a reserve team and youth coach for Aberdeen for eight years.
