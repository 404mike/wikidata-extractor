For 18 years he was a baritone with the King's Singers and the group's principal arranger for the last fifteen years of that period. In 2009 the group's album \"Simple Gifts\", on which Lawson arranged 10 out of 15 tracks, won the Grammy award for \"Best Classical Crossover Album\".

There have been 26 members of the King's Singers since the original stable group was established in late 1969, for whom the average length of tenure is around 12 years.", "Most of their a cappella concerts are divided into five distinct groups of pieces. The first four vary widely (madrigals, folk songs, recently commissioned pieces, etc.) but are generally taken from the serious side of the group's repertoire, but the last group of the concert is typically a \"close harmony\" set. Often it consists of lighter fare, including music of The Beatles, Billy Joel, Queen, George Gershwin, Harold Arlen or Irving Berlin, many of which have been arranged for the group by composers such as Richard Rodney Bennett, Jeremy Lubbock, Bob Chilcott, Philip Lawson and John Rutter. Sometimes the final set (in a concert of religious music) will be a spiritual harmony set \u2013 entitled \"Songs of Faith and Hope\". This set could be composed of American Spirituals, arranged by contemporary composers, including former group members Philip Lawson and Bob Chilcott. Pieces in this set could include \"Simple Gifts\", \"Deep River\", \"Down to the River to Pray\", and \"Stand Still Jordan\" as well as more spiritual pop songs such as \"Some Folks Lives Roll Easy\" by Paul Simon.", "Paul Phoenix founded his own consultancy, PurpleVocals and in September 2019 opens PPA, Paul Phoenix Academy, his own private music school in Hong Kong.
