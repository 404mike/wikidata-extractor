Thomas Mallen, penniless, mortgages his farming estate to make ends meet; he attempts to get his only legitimate son, Richard Mallen (David Rintoul) married to Fanny Armstrong, an unattractive girl with a rich father. Richard struggles to get Fanny to marry him, since they dislike each other, but her dowry would save Richard and Thomas from losing their big house and property. However, the plan fails due to a servant unintentionally revealing that Richard was only marrying Fanny for her money and that he didn't like her, and Richard losing his temper. He shoots and kills a visiting bailiff in the process, causing Thomas Mallen to be declared bankrupt and to lose everything. This forces Thomas to move into a small cottage, with his late wife's nieces Barbara (Pippa Guard) and Constance (Julia Chambers) and their Governess Anna Brigmore (Caroline Blakiston), who starts an affair with the now bankrupt Squire. Some time after this, Donald and his half brother Matthew Radlet (Ian Saynor) come to the cottage to visit Donald's father (their mother, whom Thomas raped in order to conceive Donald, is now married to Matthew's father, a stern farmer). Donald and Matthew then take a romantic interest in Barbara and Constance. While Donald is courting Barbara, he is also secretly trying to take Constance away from Matthew, who is in love with her (though his parents do not wish either brother to marry, since Matthew is consumptive and the family farm is not prosperous enough to support extra family members). Donald eventually achieves this aim, winning Constance and leaving both Matthew and Barbara in the lurch."]}, {"page": "London Film and Comic Con", "response": ["| 29\u201331 July 2016|| Olympia|| Carl Weathers, Dolph Lundgren, Elden Henson, Famke Janssen, Ian McDiarmid, Jack Gleeson, Michelle Gomez, Jeremy Renner, Mads Mikkelsen, Michael Emerson, Aaron Stanford, Adam Copeland, Alan Austen, Alan Tompkins, Amir Arison, Anton Lesser, Blake Foster, Bonnie Langford, Catherine Sutherland, Caroline Blakiston, Colin Baker, Colt Cabana, Daniel Portman, Dave Prowse, David Field, Dixie Arnold, Dominic Monaghan, Donald Sumpter, Ellie Kendrick, Faye Marsay, Frazer Diamond, Frazer Hines, Gail Kim, Gary Kurtz, Gemma Whelan, Jim Duggan, Harold Perrineau, Hattie Hayridge, Hardcore Holly, Jamie Harris, Jamie Kennedy, Jason David Frank, Jasper Jacob, Jeremy Bulloch, Joe Naufahu, John Galvin, Johnny Yong Bosch, Jon Heder, Judge Reinhold, Julian Sands, Kae Alexander, Keith David, Kenny Baker, Kim Coates, Kjell Nilsson, Kristian Nairn, Laurie Holden, Mike Havord, Mike Stevens, Millie Bobby Brown, Nakia Burrise, Natalia Tena, Neil Kaplan, Paul McGann, Peter Mayhew, Pip Torrens, Quentine Pierre, Rex Smith, Richard Brake, Roberta Tovey, Rob Van Dam, Rutger Hauer, Sam Coleman, Sean Maher, Stephen Bayley, Steven Berkoff, Sylvester McCoy, Ted DiBiase, Tobin Bell, Vic Armstrong, Warwick Diamond, Wendy Leech"]}, {"page": "When Love Speaks", "response": ["#\"When forty winters shall besiege thy brow\" (\"Sonnet 2\"), performed by Caroline Blakiston"]}, {"page": "The Idol (1966 film)", "response": ["*Caroline Blakiston as 2nd Woman at Party"]}]}}
