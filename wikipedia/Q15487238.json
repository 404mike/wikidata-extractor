Critical scholarship in the 19th century distinguished between the 'biographical' approach of the three Synoptic Gospels and the 'theological' approach of John, and accordingly tended to disregard John as a historical source. This distinction is no longer regarded as sustainable in more recent scholarship, which emphasizes that all four gospels are both biographical and theological. According to Barnabas Lindars, \"All four Gospels should be regarded primarily as biographies of Jesus, but all four have a definite theological aim.\"Lindars, p. 26. Sanders points out that the author would regard the gospel as theologically true as revealed spiritually even if its content is not historically accurate.Sanders, p. ??. The gospel does contain some independent, historically plausible elements.Theissen and Merz, p. ??? Henry Wansbrough says: \"Gone are the days when it was scholarly orthodoxy to maintain that John was the least reliable of the gospels historically.\" It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts, that John's knowledge of things around Jerusalem is often superior to the synoptics, and that his presentation of Jesus' agony in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically accurate than their synoptic parallels.Wansbrough, pp. 1012\u20131013. And Marianne Meye Thompson writes: \"There are items only in John that are likely to be historical and ought to be given due weight. Jesus' first disciples may once have been followers of the Baptist (cf. ). There is no a priori reason to reject the report of Jesus and his disciples' conducting a ministry of baptism for a time. That Jesus regularly visited Jerusalem, rather than merely at the time of his death, is often accepted as more realistic for a pious, 1st-century Jewish male (and is hinted at in the other Gospels as well: ; ; ) ... Even John's placement of the Last Supper before Passover has struck some as likely.\"Thompson, The Historical Jesus and the Johannine Christ, p. 28 Sanders, however, cautions that even historically plausible elements in John can hardly be taken as historical evidence, as they may well represent the author's intuition rather than historical recollection."]}, {"page": "Edward Tufnell (bishop)", "response": ["Tufnell married his cousin, Laura Tufnell, who was the daughter of John Jolliffe Tufnell of Langleys, Great Waltham, Essex.

In so doing, it complies with the instruction of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued under Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), which requires that the \"natural gender of 'personae' in the Bible, including the human author of various texts where evident, must not be changed\" and that the \"grammatical gender of God, pagan deities, and angels according to the original texts must not be changed insofar as this is possible in the receptor language.\"", "Fr.
