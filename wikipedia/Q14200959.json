He is an editor of History Workshop Journal and a Fellow of the British Psychoanalytical Society.\nPick has presented a number of radio programmes, most recently:  \u2018The Unconscious Life of Bombs\u2019, BBC Radio 4 (December 2017); \u2018Dictators on the Couch\u2019, BBC Radio 4 (June 2017);  and \u2018Freud for our Times\u2019, BBC Radio 4 (December 2016).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cesare Lombroso", "response": ["Historian Daniel Pick argues that Lombroso serves \"as a curious footnote to late-nineteenth-century literary studies,\" due to his referencing in famous books of the time. Jacques in \u00c9mile Zola's The Beast Within is described as having a jaw that juts forward on the bottom. It is emphasized especially at the end of the book when he is overwhelmed by the desire to kill. The anarchist Karl Yundt in Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent, delivers a speech denouncing Lombroso. The assistant prosecutor in Leo Tolstoy's Resurrection uses Lombroso's theories to accuse Maslova of being a congenital criminal. In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Count Dracula is described as having a physical appearance Lombroso would describe as criminal."]}, {"page": "Very Short Introductions", "response": ["| 435 || Psychoanalysis || Daniel Pick ||  || || psychology"]}, {"page": "Norman Cohn", "response": ["As Ferrari pointed out, \"the writings of Norman Cohn have gone on to influence entire generations of readers and scholars, from all sorts of backgrounds and vocations.

Although the trial proceedings  refer to a T Rees, they also refer to \"the English psychiatrist, Doctor Rees, who had Hess under observation from the first days of his flight to England\". It seems certain that this English psychiatrist was John Rawlings Rees, though a T Rees may also have been present at the Nuremberg trials."]}, {"page": "Lyndal Roper", "response": ["* Dreams and History: The Interpretation of Dreams from Ancient Greece to Modern Psychoanalysis (ed. with Daniel Pick)  (East Sussex: Brunner-Routledge, 2004) 276pp."]}, {"page": "Spirit spouse", "response": ["The spirit spouse is a widespread element of shamanism, distributed through all continents and at all cultural levels. Often, these spirit husbands/wives are seen as the primary helping spirits of the shaman, who assist them in their work, and help them gain power in the world of spirit. The relationships shamans have with their spirit spouses may be expressed in romantic, sexual, or purely symbolic ways, and may include gender transformation as a part of correctly pairing with their \"spouse\". Shamans report engaging with their spirit spouses through dreams, trance, and other ritual elements.Orlando O. Esp\u00edn & James B. Nickoloff: An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies. Liturgical Press, 2007. p. 1315b In some cultures, gaining a spirit spouse is a necessary and expected part of initiation into becoming a shaman. Examples of spirit spouses may be seen in non-shamanic cultures as well, including dreams about Jesus Christ by nuns,instance (Russian Orthodox) \u2013 Steven Fanning: Mystics of the Christian Tradition.
