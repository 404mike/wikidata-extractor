The UREI 813s were replaced around 1990 by ATC main monitors. Customised ATC SCM150ASL active speakers are used for the main left and right channels with a standard ATC SCM150ASL active speaker used as the centre channel. The centre channel sits above an ATC SCM0.1\u201315 subwoofer. The surround monitors are two ATC SCM50ASLs. A variety of near-field monitor speakers are used including Yamaha NS-10s and Auratones depending on who happens to be working at the studio. The acoustic design was done with the assistance of Nick Whitaker, an independent acoustician, and much of the equipment was recommended by James Guthrie and Andrew Jackson. Nowadays the Astoria has a Neve 88R mixing console, as well as three Studer A827 multi-tracks and Ampex ATR-100 tape recorders, which were modified by Tim de Paravicini, Esoteric Audio Research's (EAR) founder. The conversion to a studio also required 14 miles (23\u00a0km) of cables, which were sourced from Van den Hul cables of the Netherlands. There are various compressors from Pye and EAR 660 tube designs, as well as EAR 825s for EQ."]}, {"page": "A Meeting by the River", "response": ["* Tim de Paravicini \u2013 technical consultant"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2020", "response": ["*Tim de Paravicini, 75, English audio designer.Tim de Paravicini - The Passing of a True Giant in the Audio Industry"]}, {"page": "Paravicini", "response": ["*Tim de Paravicini (1945-2020), English electronic engineer, designer and founder of EAR Yoshin"]}]}}
