Jonathan Swift and Henry Fielding use Abigail in this generic sense, as does Charlotte Bront\u00eb. Anthony Trollope makes two references to the abigail (all lower case) in The Eustace Diamonds, at the beginning of Chapter 42, whilst Thomas Mann makes the same reference at the start of the second chapter of Part 2 in Buddenbrooks (published in 1901). William Rose Benet notes the notoriety of Abigail Hill, better known as \"Mrs Masham\", a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne.The Reader's Encyclopedia, 1948, s.v. \"Abigail\".

Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770\u20131850), thought him a \"very talkative, vulgar young person\", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828\u20131909), found Dickens \"intellectually lacking\".Neil Roberts, Meredith and the Novel. Springer, 1997, p. 49. In 1888 Leslie Stephen commented in the Dictionary of National Biography that \"if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists\".Dictionary of National Biography Macmillan, 1888, p. 30. Anthony Trollope's Autobiography famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: \"We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!\" Tolstoy referred to David Copperfield as his favourite book, and he later adopted the novel as \"a model for his own autobiographical reflections\". French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels \"stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression\".Soubigou, Gilles \"Dickens's Illustrations: France and other countries\" pp. 154-167 from The Reception of Charles Dickens in Europe edited by Michael Hollington London: A&C Black 2013 p. 161.

Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature.. Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him \"the greatest of superficial novelists\": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth, and the novels, \"loose baggy monsters\",. betrayed a \"cavalier organisation\".. Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms, and noted he had \"an intense and unreasoning affection\" for Bleak House, dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in The Secret Agent (1907).

In December he attended Nekrasov's funeral and gave a speech. He was appointed an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, from which he received an honorary certificate in February 1879. He declined an invitation to an international congress on copyright in Paris after his son Alyosha had a severe epileptic seizure and died on 16 May.

William Howitt's visit was quite different: his account is called \"A day-dream at Tintagel\" (in Visits to Remarkable Places). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include Anthony Trollope's short story Malachi's Cove and the Charles and Alice Muriel Williamson's epistolary novel Set in Silver published in 1909. Ernest George Henham was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym John Trevena for many of his books; it is probable that the surname he chose was derived from the original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon. Tintagel features prominently in Edith Wharton's final, unfinished novel, The Buccaneers, the protagonist of which, Nan St. George, meets her future husband, the Duke of Tintagel, while exploring the ruins of Tintagel Castle. Wharton styled the characters as Duke and Duchess of Tintagel, while Tintagel actually lies within the Duchy of Cornwall; in the novel, the Duke and Duchess live in a newer, fictional Tintagel Castle, built in approximately the late 18th century."]}, {"page": "Fox hunting", "response": ["* Anthony Trollope, who was addicted to hunting, felt himself \"deprived of a legitimate joy\" when he could not introduce a hunting scene into one of his novels.Trollope, A.
