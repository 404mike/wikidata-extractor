By this time, Williams had found a solicitor who had arranged for Patrick Hastings and C. F. Baker to represent him in court.  The Crown was represented by Sir Frederick Low and Cecil Whiteley.  The trial proved a popular one, with crowds of people outside the court house trying to see the defendants or barristers involved. A local newspaper described it as \"the most sensational murder trial ... within living history.\"Hyde (1960) p. 43.", "Florence Seymour was the first person called to the witness box. She said that her statement was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not.Hyde (1960) p. 44. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams.  Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if what she had said in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears."]}, {"page": "Sir Frederick Low", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Low (British politician)"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1909", "response": ["|Frederick Low, KC"]}]}}
