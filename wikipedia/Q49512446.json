Augustus W. N. Pugin, the foremost expert on the Gothic, had to submit each of his designs through, and thus in the name of, other architects, Gillespie-Graham and Charles Barry, because he had recently openly and fervently converted to Roman Catholicism, as a consequence of which any design submitted in his own name would certainly have been automatically rejected; the design he submitted for improvements to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1843 were rejected for this reason. The design for Parliament that Pugin submitted through Barry won the competition. Barry was awarded a prize (or \"premium\") of \u00a31,500. Premiums of \u00a3500 each were given to David Hamilton, J. C. Buckler and William Railton. The Architectural Magazine summarised Barry's winning plan as \"a quadrangular pile, with the principal front facing the Thames, and a tower in the centre, 170ft high\"."]}, {"page": "Ralph Vivian", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Vivian (artist)#Family"]}]}}
