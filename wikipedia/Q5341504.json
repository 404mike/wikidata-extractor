The details of the conversation were passed to an RAF Air Staff technical advisor, Dr. R. V. Jones, who started a search which discovered that  Lorenz receivers were more than blind-landing devices. Jones began a search for German beams; Avro Ansons of the Beam Approach Training Development Unit (BATDU) were flown up and down Britain fitted with a 30\u00a0MHz receiver. Soon a beam was traced to Derby (which had been mentioned in  transmissions). The first jamming operations were carried out using requisitioned hospital electrocautery machines.Mackay 2003, pp. 88\u201389. The counter-operations were carried out by British Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) units under Wing Commander Edward Addison, No. 80 Wing RAF. The production of false radio navigation signals by re-transmitting the originals became known as meaconing using masking beacons (). Up to nine special transmitters directed their signals at the beams in a manner that subtly widened their paths, making it harder for bomber crews to locate targets; confidence in the device was diminished by the time the  was ready to conduct big raids."]}, {"page": "No. 100 Group RAF", "response": ["The group disbanded on 17 December 1945.

The technical design of countermeasures was handled by a section under Dr Robert Cockburn at the Telecommunications Research Establishment at Swanage, Dorset.
