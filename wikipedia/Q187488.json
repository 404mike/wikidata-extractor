He has been ranked the number one in the men's \u221280 kg division on several occasions. He is a three-time European champion having won the \u221280 kg title at the European Taekwondo Championships in 2010, 2012 representing Great Britain and 2014 representing the Isle of Man, and was the world junior champion in the \u221278 kg division in 2008.\nHe represented Great Britain in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where he reached the semi-final and was narrowly defeated in the bronze medal match. He was controversially left out of the British team for the 2012 Olympic Games in London despite being the world no. 1-ranked competitor in the \u221280 kg division when the British Taekwondo Control Board selected Lutalo Muhammad (who was ranked world no. 59 in \u221280 kg and world no. 7 in \u221287 kg). Following this, Cook indicated he could no longer work with the governing authorities in Great Britain, and switched allegiance to the Isle of Man. This move to a non-Olympic nation ostensibly allowed Cook to achieve qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics for Great Britain, the country for which Isle of Man athletes participate at the Olympics.\nHe represented the Isle of Man in international tournaments from February 2013 until 2015 when following further discussions with the Great Britain authorities, Cook sought and obtained Moldovan citizenship and announced that he would compete for Moldova.  At the 2015 World Taekwondo Championships, Cook represented his new country for the first time, losing to former Great Britain teammate Damon Samsum in the semi-final. Despite this, Cook won the bronze medal in his weight category, his first medal in a World Championship.\nCook later won silver at the 2018 European Taekwondo Championships in Kazan in the 80 kg weight category.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorchester, Dorset", "response": ["* Aaron Cook (born 1991), a taekwondo athlete who competed in the 2008 Olympic Games finishing in fifth place, was born and educated in Dorchester."]}, {"page": "List of sportspeople who competed for more than one nation", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Aaron Cook"]}, {"page": "The Thomas Hardye School", "response": ["* Aaron Cook attended the school but left prematurely to pursue his training for the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics"]}, {"page": "British Taekwondo Control Board", "response": ["GB Taekwondo holds the mandate for selecting National Team players and Olympic Team players in the UK.
