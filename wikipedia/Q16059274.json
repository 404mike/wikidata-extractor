Bracy often played the leading tenor role in the works in which he appeared, becoming one of the most popular comic tenors of the Victorian era. His wife, Clara, was an actress.\nAfter beginning his career in Plymouth, Bracy spent four years performing at London's Gaiety Theatre in the early 1870s.  He and his wife then travelled to Australia, where they performed in French operettas for the rest of the decade. They returned to Britain in 1880, continuing in operetta roles. In 1884, Bracy originated the role of Hilarion, after which he further built his reputation in British comic opera and operetta. In 1888, the Bracys returned to Australia. After a season at the Sydney Opera House and touring in operettas, the Bracys joined the J. C. Williamson organisation, by which he was employed for most of his ensuing career, until 1914, as a performer, stage manager, stage director and casting agent. His occasional attempts at theatre management on his own behalf brought him financial losses and forced him to declare bankruptcy in 1897.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Utopia, Limited", "response": ["Before the end of October, the title of the piece was changed from Utopia (Limited) to Utopia, Limited.\"Savoy Theatre\", The Times, 24 October 1893, p. 6.

This transaction marked the beginning of Williamson's long career as Australia's foremost theatrical manager.  After a tour of New Zealand, in 1882 Williamson entered into partnership with Arthur Garner and George Musgrove.  This triumvirate was often criticized for creating a monopoly, crushing the old repertory system and discouraging local actors, but it brought to Australia such artists as Dion Boucicault, as well as employing new and local talent such as Nellie Stewart and Howard Vernon.  In December 1886, they opened the luxurious (New) Princess's Theatre in Melbourne with The Mikado.  By 1890, Williamson had hired Henry Bracy as a leading tenor and a stage manager.
