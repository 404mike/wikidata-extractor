His victory, by a majority of only 7 votes, came after a  closely fought four-way contest between Labour, Conservative, Liberal and National Liberal candidates, all of whom won over 21% of the votes.The following year, at the general election in December 1923, the rift in the Liberal Party had been healed, and Privett lost the seat to Sir Thomas Bramsdon, the Liberal who he had beaten the previous year. After his defeat, Privett stood for Parliament on only one further occasion, when he was unsuccessful as an \"Independent Conservative\" candidate in the Southern division of Portsmouth at the 1929 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of close election results", "response": ["|In this four-way race, Conservative Party candidate Frank Privett defeated National Liberal candidate T.
