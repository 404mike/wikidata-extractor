It found that no prisoners had been murdered, nor that their bodies had been mutilated and that the evidence to that effect from the detainees was deliberately untruthful. However, the inquiry did find that British soldiers mistreated nine Iraqi prisoners, but not deliberately. It stated that the ill-treatment was much milder than the initial accusations of torture, mutilation and murder. Sir Thayne said that the \"most serious allegations\" which \"have been hanging over [the British] soldiers for the past 10 years\" have been found to be \"without foundation\". The inquiry found that the allegations made by the Iraqis and their lawyers were based on \"deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility\". As a result of the inquiry's findings Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day, another firm involved in cases against British troops, were referred to the Solicitors Regulatory Authority. In August 2016 Public Interest Lawyers went out of business, while the British government announced it would take steps to prevent further spurious claims against troops.Law firm at centre of Al-Sweady inquiry to close down, say reports, The Guardian, 15 August 2016 In December 2016 Professor Phil Shiner, head of Public Interest Lawyers, admitted guilt in relation to claims of wrongdoing by British troops in the context of professional misconduct proceedings.
