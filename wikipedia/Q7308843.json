While commanding a division at the Battle of Arras in 1917, he was immortalised as the \"cheery old card\" of Siegfried Sassoon's poem \"The General\".\nPinney served in South Africa during the Boer War with the Royal Fusiliers, and at the outbreak of the First World War was given command of a brigade sent to reinforce the Western Front in November 1914. He led it in the early part of 1915, taking heavy losses at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. That September he was given command of the 35th Division, a New Army division of \"bantam\" soldiers, which first saw action at the Battle of the Somme; after three months in action, he was exchanged with the commander of the 33rd Division.\nHe commanded the 33rd at Arras in 1917, with mixed results, and through the German spring offensive in 1918, where the division helped stabilise the defensive line after the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was routed. After the war, he retired to rural Dorset, where he served as a local justice of the peace, as High Sheriff for the county, and as a Deputy Lieutenant.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
