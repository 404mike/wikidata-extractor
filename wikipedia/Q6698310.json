Writing in  New Statesman David Jays says that Lucy Gannon's characters are sharpened by indignation, and \"sorrow rounds them in the Dickensian manner\". He also praises the show's use of classical music, rather than \"second guessing youthful tunes and  getting it cringingly wrong\".  The Observers Caroline Boucher praised Gannon's \"speedy character establishment\" and Henry's \"convincing\" portrayal. Adam Sweeting in The Guardian was more critical, suggesting it is \"old-fashioned melodrama\", unfavorably contrasting Gannon with celebrated writers such as Jimmy McGovern and Alan Bleasdale. The use of classical music was \"disorienting\", and Sweeting suggests that \"maybe education is too pressing and prickly an issue to be liquidised into soap opera, with its inevitable clich\u00e9s and illogicalities.\" Writing in the Financial Times, Christopher Dunkley says the drama has \"moments of interest\", although Joe Joseph in The Times was very critical of the first series."]}, {"page": "1997 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Lucy Gannon, Writer.
