They started 2016 with a 2\u20131 win against Winterton at the KC Lightstream Stadium, with Gary Bradshaw also getting his first goal for the club. This was to be their last game here as on 13 January the club announced it would no longer be playing at the stadium due to being unable to afford the match day running costs.", "On 15 January former North Ferriby captain and Scarborough Athletic Player/Manager Paul Foot signed for the club, joining up with fellow ex Ferriby legend Gary Bradshaw once more. It was revealed on 22 January that the club had made a request to groundshare with Brigg Town, however this was rejected by the league, meaning United would have to play their remaining games away until the end of the season or until a suitable ground could be found. Following this they were deducted 3 points after fielding a suspended player against Hallam F.C. earlier in the season, a game they won 2\u20130. They played their first game in a month on 2 February, after four games in January were postponed, beating Grimsby Borough 2\u20131 away, with Paul Foot scoring on his debut.", "*Gary Bradshaw"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Gary Bradshaw"]}, {"page": "Bradshaw, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Bradshaw"]}]}}
