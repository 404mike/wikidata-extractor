This allowed Crawford to conclude on page 355 \"...\u00a0it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined.\" The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also came to the conclusion that it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow studied the mineral and proposed the name strontites.Although Thomas C. Hope had investigated strontium ores since 1791, his research was published in:  He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: \"...\u00a0Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion.\" The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to strontium.Many other early investigators examined strontium ore, among them: (1) Martin Heinrich Klaproth, \"Chemische Versuche \u00fcber die Strontianerde\" (Chemical experiments on strontian ore), Crell's Annalen (September 1793) no. ii, pp. 189\u2013202 ; and \"Nachtrag zu den Versuchen \u00fcber die Strontianerde\" (Addition to the Experiments on Strontian Ore), Crell's Annalen (February 1794) no. i, p. 99 ; also (2) "]}, {"page": "1844", "response": ["* June 13 \u2013 Thomas Charles Hope, Scottish chemist, discoverer of strontium (b. 1766)"]}, {"page": "1766", "response": ["* July 21 \u2013 Thomas Charles Hope, Scottish chemist, discoverer of strontium (d. 1844)"]}, {"page": "Alkaline earth metal", "response": ["In 1790, physician Adair Crawford discovered ores with distinctive properties, which were named strontites in 1793 by Thomas Charles Hope, a chemistry professor at the University of Glasgow, who confirmed Crawford's discovery.
