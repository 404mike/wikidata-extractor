Playing mainly for Surrey from 1801, but also for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and some other county teams, Lambert was a right-hand batsman and an underarm slow bowler.\nLambert was described by Arthur Haygarth as \"one of the most successful cricketers that has ever yet appeared, excelling as he did in batting, bowling, fielding, keeping wicket, and also single wicket playing\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W.

The Hampshire teams promoted by the Hambledon Club were very competitive and so, evidently, were their opponents, among whom Yalden was a prominent member, sometimes as captain. Nyren describes Yalden as \"a thin, dark-looking man\" and as \"not a fine, but a very useful and steady batter\". Nyren revered Hambledon's Tom Sueter and Yalden was Sueter's rival as both a wicketkeeper and a batsman, although they played together for Hampshire in 1772. They are the first two players in cricket history to be recognised as \"wicketkeeper/batsmen\", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone. Nyren chose to denigrate Yalden in comparison with his hero Sueter saying that: \"I must place Sueter above Yalden\" (i.e., as a wicketkeeper) and that Yalden \"was in other respects an inferior man to Sueter\". Nyren says that Yalden's \"word was not always to be depended on when he had put a man out\" as \"he would now and then shuffle (sic) and \"resort to trick\". He goes on to assert that Sueter and the other Hambledon players would not do such things because of \"estimation\", \"honour\", \"trust\" and never questioning the decision of the umpire. Nyren's comments are seriously biased but some balance is provided by the editor's introduction to the modern version of the book when he states that \"Yalden \u2013 the England wicketkeeper and captain, no less \u2013 is dismissed in a few words\" while several other notable players are not mentioned at all.Nyren, p. 36 (editor's comments). Elsewhere the editor discusses Nyren's undoubted plagiarism of an earlier work by William Lambert and it is widely agreed that Nyren's account of Hambledon's players is hagiographic, often at the expense of their opponents, and Yalden is one player who was not given a fair hearing in this book.Nyren, p. 31 (editor's comments)."]}, {"page": "Lamborn (Hambledon cricketer)", "response": ["Few personal details of Lamborn are known, though it has been supposed his first name was William, but this is based on an error arising from confusion with the much later cricketer William Lambert.
