It was during this period that he was chosen to represent Lancashire as a replacement for Cecil Parkin, who had left the club to play league cricket. As well as bowling off spin, Sibbles sometimes bowled medium pace and using off-cutters, regularly opened the bowling for Lancashire in the 1930s. In his final season for Lancashire, Sibbles' bowling was affected by a knee injury and he was forced to retire. According to Wisden, he was \"one of the most consistent cricketers without a major representative honour to his name\". \nAfter retiring from playing, Sibbles joined the Lancashire committee, and at one point was a member of the board of selectors which chose the Lancashire team. On 20 July 1973, Sibbles died suddenly at his home in Bramhall, although he had been ill for several years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dick Pollard", "response": ["Pollard made his first-class debut for Lancashire in August 1933 against Nottinghamshire; while batting at number 11 he scored 16 not out, and took the wicket of Nottinghamshire captain Arthur Carr. In Lancashire's County Championship-winning side of 1934, he was seen as a medium-paced reserve to the front-line bowlers, but injuries, particularly to Frank Sibbles, meant that he played 11 matches in the last two months of the season, and took 38\u00a0wickets in them at an average of 19.31. In the second innings of a match against Gloucestershire, Pollard took 6 wickets for 21 runs. Wisden reported that \"He kept a fine length and made the ball turn quickly with great effect\". It was his best bowling at the time, beating his previous best of 2/31. In Championship games, he made only 14 runs in total, but in the end-of-season Champion County v The Rest match at The Oval, he scored 27 not out in the first innings and 28 in the second. The Rest were made of players from counties other than the current champions."]}, {"page": "Henry Jones-Davies", "response": ["Jones-Davies was born at Portsmouth in October 1912. He later studied at Keble College at the University of Oxford, where he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against Lancashire at Oxford in 1932. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed without scoring in the Oxford first innings by Frank Sibbles, while in their second innings he was unbeaten on 4 runs."]}]}}
