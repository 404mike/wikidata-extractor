It was during this period that he was chosen to represent Lancashire as a replacement for Cecil Parkin, who had left the club to play league cricket. As well as bowling off spin, Sibbles sometimes bowled medium pace and using off-cutters, regularly opened the bowling for Lancashire in the 1930s. In his final season for Lancashire, Sibbles' bowling was affected by a knee injury and he was forced to retire. According to Wisden, he was \"one of the most consistent cricketers without a major representative honour to his name\". \nAfter retiring from playing, Sibbles joined the Lancashire committee, and at one point was a member of the board of selectors which chose the Lancashire team. On 20 July 1973, Sibbles died suddenly at his home in Bramhall, although he had been ill for several years.", "link_mentions": {}}}
