Humphrey Lyttelton, who played with Webb, formed his own band based on the New Orleans/Louis Armstrong tradition in 1948 but, without losing the Armstrong influence, gradually adopted a more mainstream approach. By 1958 his band included three saxophones. During the 1950s and well into the 1960s the \"Three B's\" Chris Barber, Acker Bilk, and Kenny Ball were particularly successful, all making hit records.
