This, unlike many rivalries, is generally friendly as both sets of fans live and work together given their close geographic locations.  Due to the geographical proximity of the clubs and despite the rivalry, Inverness CT have signed many former Ross County players over the years, including Barry Wilson, Stuart Golabek, Roy McBain, Graham Bayne, Richard Hastings, Steven Hislop, John Rankin, Andrew Barrowman, Lionel Djebi-Zadi and Don Cowie. Many former Inverness CT players have also \"crossed the bridge\" in the opposite direction, most notably Grant Munro, Michael Fraser,  Ross Tokely and Coll Donaldson in recent years. Both Stuart Golabek and Andy Barrowman had two spells at County each, with the former also having two spells at ICT. A notable player is Iain Vigurs, who is one of (if not the first) few player(s) to cross the bridge more than twice, having spent two spells with both County and Caley Thistle."]}, {"page": "John Ruddy", "response": ["On 24 July 2009, Ruddy joined Scottish Premier League club Motherwell on a six-month loan deal, to vie with Michael Fraser and Sebastian Kosiorowski for a place in goal. Ruddy kept clean sheets during a 0\u20130 home draw against Rangers on 12 September 2009 and a 0\u20130 away draw against Celtic on 17 October 2009. He also saved a Barry Robson penalty in a 3\u20132 loss to Celtic on 12 December 2009. When the original loan deal expired in January 2010, the Fir Park club decided that they wanted to keep Ruddy for longer and an extension of a month was agreed with Everton. On 27 January 2010, it was announced that both Ruddy and Everton teammate Lukas Jutkiewicz were to extend their stay at the Scottish Premier League club until May 2010. Ruddy finished the Scottish Premier League season with 15 clean sheets from 34 appearances."]}, {"page": "Glenurquhart Shinty Club", "response": ["Former Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Ross County and Motherwell goalkeeper Michael Fraser currently plays for the club, after having retired from professional football.
