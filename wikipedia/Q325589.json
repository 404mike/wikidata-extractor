There is a belief that she was buried between platforms 9 and 10 in King's Cross station in London, England. There is no evidence for this and it is probably a post-World War II invention.

She used the opportunity to propagate her own witch-cult theory, failing to mention the alternate theories proposed by other academics. Her entry would be included in the encyclopedia until 1969, becoming readily accessible to the public, and it was for this reason that her ideas on the subject had such a significant impact. It received a particularly enthusiastic reception by occultists such as Dion Fortune, Lewis Spence, Ralph Shirley, and J. W. Brodie Innes, perhaps because its claims regarding an ancient secret society chimed with similar claims common among various occult groups. Murray joined the Folklore Society in February 1927, and was elected to the society's council a month later, although she stood down in 1929. Murray reiterated her witch-cult theory in her 1933 book, The God of the Witches, which was aimed at a wider, non-academic audience. In this book, she cut out or toned down what she saw as the more unpleasant aspects of the witch-cult, such as animal and child sacrifice, and began describing the religion in more positive terms as \"the Old Religion\"."]}, {"page": "Taxil hoax", "response": ["Arthur Edward Waite, debunking the existence of the group in Devil-Worship in France, or The Question of Lucifer, ch.

Chapter IV of Atlantis: The Antediluvian World (1882) by Ignatius L. Donnelly, titled \"The God Odin, Woden, or Wotan\", repeats Clavijero's reference in the context of speculation about Atlantis and (following Brasseur de Bourbourg) also suggests that Votan built Palenque. Donnelly quotes Clavijero as saying that Votan \"conducted seven families from Valum-Votan to this continent, and assigned lands to them\",Donnelly 1882, p. 314 and implies that \"Valum-Votan\" may have been a reference to Atlantis.Donnelly 1882, p. 316 The story of Votan was further associated with the Atlantis legend by Lewis Spence in Atlantis in America (1925), who identifies Votan as \"a local name for Quetzalcoatl\" and provides a synopsis of the account by N\u00fa\u00f1ez de la Vega.Spence 1925, pp. 55-56 Votan has also been cited in the literature of neo-Nazism and white supremacy that associates him with Quetzalcoatl and Kukulcan and asserts that he was a bearded, White European who came to Mexico in pre-Columbian times.

The original name of the bridge was Broad Ford Bridge. The corruption \"Battle Bridge\" led to a tradition that this was the site of a major battle in AD 60 or 61 between the Romans and the Iceni tribe led by Boudica (also known as Boudicea). The tradition claims support from the writing of Publius Cornelius Tacitus, an ancient Roman historian, who described the place of action between the Romans and Boadicea (Annals 14.31), but without specifying where it was; Thornbury addresses the pros and cons of the identification. Lewis Spence's 1937 book Boadicea \u2013 warrior queen of the Britons includes a map showing the supposed positions of the opposing armies. The suggestion that Boudica is buried beneath platform 9 or 10 at King's Cross station seems to have arisen as urban folklore since the end of World War II.
