Her debut novel, Stage By Stage, was published in July 2005 and won the Romantic Novelists' Association Joan Hessayon Award the same year.\nIn her first career as software engineer, she was the architect of the SuperBASIC programming language for the Sinclair QL personal computer while working at Sinclair Research in the early 1980s. Before joining Sinclair Research, she worked at British Gas and the Royal School of Mines as a programmer and lecturer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sinclair QL", "response": ["QDOS, a pre-emptive multitasking operating system primarily designed by Tony Tebby, was included on ROM, as was an advanced structured BASIC interpreter, named SuperBASIC designed by Jan Jones, which was also used as the command-line interpreter.

It was developed at Sinclair Research by Jan Jones during the early 1980s. Originally SuperBASIC was intended as the BASIC interpreter for a home computer code-named SuperSpectrum, then under development. This project was later cancelled; however, SuperBASIC was subsequently included in the ROM firmware of the Sinclair QL microcomputer (announced in January 1984), also serving as the command line interpreter for the QL's QDOS operating system. It was one of the first second-generation BASICs to be integrated into a microcomputer's operating system (unlike BBC BASIC which preceded it in 1981), making the OS user-extendable\u2014as done by Linus Torvalds in his formative years.", "* Jan Jones: QL SuperBasic: The Definitive Handbook.

In September 1978, Shepardson Microsystems was finishing Cromemco 16K Structured BASIC for the Z80-based Cromemco S-100 bus machines. Paul Laughton and Kathleen O'Brien then created Atari BASIC as essentially a pared-down version of Cromemco BASIC ported to the 6502. In 1979, Warren Robinett developed the BASIC Programming cartridge for Atari, Inc., even though it only supported programs with 9 lines of code (64 characters in total). Also in 1979, Texas Instruments released TI-BASIC with its TI-99/4, which would sell nearly 3 million systems when revamped as the TI-99/4A. Sinclair BASIC was developed for the ZX-80 by John Grant and Steve Vickers of Nine Tiles. In 1980, Sophie Wilson of Acorn Computers developed Atom BASIC, which she later evolved into BBC BASIC, one of the first interpreters to offer structured BASIC programming, with named DEF PROC/DEF FN procedures and functions, REPEAT UNTIL loops, and IF THEN ELSE structures inspired by COMAL. Jan Jones developed SuperBASIC, another British BASIC supporting structured programming, for the Sinclair QL. In 1983, Randall Hyde developed SmartBASIC for the Coleco Adam. Richard Clayton, Chris Hall, and Paul Overell developed Mallard BASIC for the BBC Micro and Locomotive BASIC for the Amstrad CPC, both supporting commands for an ISAM indexed file system. In 1985, MetaComCo released ABasiC for the Amiga and ST BASIC for the Atari ST."]}]}}
