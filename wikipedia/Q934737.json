The single was also the first Michael had recorded as a solo artist which he had not written himself.

Erlewine goes on in his review, criticising both Eric Clapton's and Simon Climie's production: \"The problem lies in the production, which relies entirely on stiff mechanical drumbeats, gauzy synthesizers, and meandering instrumental interludes. These ingredients could result in a good record, as 'Change the World' demonstrated, but not here, due to [the album's] monotonous production\". The music critic also notes Clapton's singing and playing is weird on Pilgrim, noting \"Clapton doesn't want to shake things up \u2013 his singing is startlingly mannered, even on emotionally turbulent numbers like 'My Father's Eyes' or 'Circus'. Even worse, he's content to take a back seat instrumentally, playing slight solos and fills as colorless as the electronic backdrops\". Comparing the album to the hit releases Journeyman, From the Cradle and Unplugged, Erlewine finishes his review for AllMusic, calling the 1998 studio effort full of \"blandness\" and \"disappointing\". Critics from the music website CD Shakedown positively note, the album \"may put off some of Clapton's fans. But the gems are here, including the leadoff single, 'My Father's Eyes' and 'Circus' as [Pilgrim] delivers your money's worth [and has] high points\". However, the reviewers criticize the album's plus 70 minutes length, finding it \"more manageable if Clapton had released it as a double-disc package\". Rolling Stone journalist David Wild recalls: \"Pilgrim will not thrill those looking for From the Cradle II \u2013 most of this state-of-the-charts album sounds absolutely nothing like any record Muddy Waters ever made. But it's still a blues album in the sense that it captures the sound of a man trying to tame hellhounds from within and without. In the end, Pilgrim is not purely anything, except purely moving\". He awarded the release four out of five possible stars. Natalie Nichols from the Los Angeles Times rates Pilgrim with two out of four possible stars, reviewing it with the predicate \"fair\" and thinks the majority of tracks on the release were not that thought through, however, two songs were: \"'My Father's Eyes', Clapton's rumination on maturity, hold their own against the wall of sound. While his guitar playing is kept on its usual leash here, he lets loose occasional bursts of staccato blues licks, as on the funky 'She's Gone', which musters up some sass to offset all the heartbreak\".
