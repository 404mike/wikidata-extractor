The design is based on the tree of life, an ancient symbol representing the renewal of life. The completed nave is a square space that is enclosed by an outer ambulatory. The ambulatory is low and vaulted. Because the furniture in the nave is not fixed, it can be used for various means, including concerts and exhibitions as well as services. On the rood screen, beneath the nave organ case is a sculpture called Christus by Peter Eugene Ball. The nave organ case was designed by Didier Grassin in 2001; the inside of the panels were designed by Patrick Caulfield. The left side depicts night, with a stylised lighthouse shining on the sea (which alludes to the City of Portsmouth's motto, \"Heaven's Light Our Guide\"). The right door depicts day, showing the sun and the hull of a fishing boat."]}, {"page": "Illiam Dhone", "response": ["In January 2006 a monument created by Bryan Kneale dedicated to Dhone was erected at Malew Church, where Dhone is buried."]}, {"page": "1930 in art", "response": ["* 19 June \u2013 Bryan Kneale, Manx sculptor and academic"]}, {"page": "List of Manx people", "response": ["*Bryan Kneale (born 1930), sculptor"]}, {"page": "List of people from the Isle of Man", "response": ["*Bryan Kneale RA (born 1930), sculptor, known for teaching art in London and his works are exhibited in many countries around the world."]}, {"page": "Aubrey Gibson", "response": ["The silver rosebowl was one of a range of works commissioned by Gibson.
