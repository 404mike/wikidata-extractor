Into the side came Tony Ellis, Lee Sandford, Tony Kelly, Dave Kevan, Paul Barnes and Noel Blake. It was a big gamble by Ball to change so much of the squad so quickly, and it did not pay off.

He played in school bands, and after he graduated from high school he got a job with Stan Kenton's Orchestra. He auditioned for Kenton's band and was given a choice: wait for the first opening in the trumpet section or join the band the following week as a member of the mellophonium section. He chose the latter and spent much of 1961\u201362 on the road with Kenton. Said Saunders about the experience with the mellophonium band, \"I was developing perfect pitch from playing the trumpet. However, once I joined Kenton to play the mellophone, my whole system got mixed up, because the trumpet is in Bb and the mellophonium is in F so needless to say my confidence in perfect pitch was shaken and I ended up with relative pitch.\"Interview with Carl Saunders on ArtistInterviews", "* 2004 The Carl Saunders Sextet: Live in Union Square"]}, {"page": "List of Stoke City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Carl Saunders"]}, {"page": "List of foreign football players in Malta", "response": ["* Carl Saunders"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Carl Saunders"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Carl Saunders"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Carl Saunders"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["In September 1986 local businessman Peter Coates assumed the role of chairman and a full-strength board backed manager Mills with money for players.
