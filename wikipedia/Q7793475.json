The attention he paid to his pupils' religious education rendered him well qualified to answer the attacks of Thomas Rennell, master of the Temple, and Thomas Lewis O'Beirne, bishop of Meath, who had charged headmasters with neglecting this branch of their duties. Vincent's Defence of Public Education, issued as a reply to the latter in 1801, reached a third edition two years later, and occasioned some controversy. In April 1801 he was nominated by William Pitt, the Prime Minister, to a canonry of Westminster. When in the following year Pitt's successor, Henry Addington, offered him the deanery of Westminster \"as a public reward for public services\", this was understood to refer to his recent publication. He was presented as dean on 3 August 1802, becoming the first dean since the late 17th century not to have held the office in conjunction with that of Bishop of Rochester."]}, {"page": "Thomas Rennell (scholar)", "response": ["Thomas Rennell (1787\u20131824) was an English theologian and author.", "The only son of Thomas Rennell, Dean of Winchester Cathedral, he was born at Winchester in 1787.

He won one of Dr. Claudius Buchanan's prizes for a Greek Sapphic ode on the propagation of the gospel in India, and a prize for Latin verses on 'Pallentes Morbi' (pale diseases, personified beings in the works of Virgil). He also conducted, in conjunction with three of his contemporaries, a periodical called the Miniature, a successor of the 'Microcosm'. In 1806 he was elected from Eton to King's College, Cambridge. There in 1806 he won Sir William Browne's medal for the best Greek ode on the subject 'Veris Comites'; in 1810 he published, in conjunction with Charles James Blomfield, afterwards bishop of London, Musae Cantabrigienses, and he contributed to the Museum Criticum, a journal established in 1813 by Blomfield and Monk.
