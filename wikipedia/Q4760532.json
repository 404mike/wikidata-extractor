With the retirement of goalkeeping legend Andy Collett, the club only had two goalkeepers on their books in Michael Price and youth team player Jack Norton. Russell was a target for Hodgson after he heard that Middlesbrough were releasing the youngster. Initially it was thought Russell would be number two to Price, but performances during pre-season meant that Russell got the nod. Assistant manager Mark Proctor said that both Price and Russell were of virtual equal quality but Russsell's distribution was slightly better."]}, {"page": "1995 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["|GK ||13||Andy Collett"]}, {"page": "2000 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Darlington faced Hartlepool United in the other semi-final and the first leg was played at Victoria Park in Hartlepool on 13 May.

Hartlepool United's Craig Midgley went close after taking the ball round Darlington's goalkeeper Andy Collett but his shot was wide.  With a quarter of an hour to go, second-half substitute Glenn Naylor was brought down by Hartlepool's goalkeeper Martin Hollund who  was sent off. Marco Gabbiadini converted the subsequent penalty past Andy Dibble, and the match ended 2\u20130.  The second leg of the semi-final was held four days later at Feethams in Darlington.  In front of their largest crowd for nine years, the home side took the lead in the ninth minute when Hartlepool defender Gary Strodder headed a cross from Darlington's Phil Brumwell into his own net for an own goal.
