As a result of needing a majority in all three houses, the General Synod rejected the motion. Following the rejection of the 'take note' motion, the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York called for the need of a \"radical new Christian inclusion\" that is \"founded in Scripture, in reason, in tradition, in theology and the Christian faith as the Church of England has received it; it must be based on good, healthy, flourishing relationships, and in a proper 21st century understanding of being human and of being sexual\". In June 2017, the two Archbishops announced the appointment of a Pastoral Advisory Group and an Episcopal Teaching Document Group. The Pastoral Advisory Group aims to support and advise dioceses on the \"current pastoral approach of the Church to human sexuality\", with a focus on same-sex couples; the chair is Christine Hardman, Bishop of Newcastle.
