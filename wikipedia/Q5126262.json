Having returned from a trip to Strasbourg to visit his parents, Wenger attended a press meeting and strongly refuted the claims: \"If something comes out that is wrong, I will attack. It is a serious matter if you can just create things that are not right.\" Arsenal's press officer Clare Tomlinson, who was present at the news conference, recalled Wenger phoning the next day and demanding why he could not take action against the press for printing the story. The culprit responsible for spreading gossip in the City later apologised to Wenger. During this, Arsenal had led the Premier League, but poor form in February 1997 caused Wenger to rule out his team's chances of winning the title. They finished third in his first season, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification to Newcastle United on goal difference \u2013 the tiebreaker used to determine the ranking between teams equal on points."]}]}}
