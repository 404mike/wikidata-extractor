Born Norman Edgar Hubert on 1 June 1906 in Billingshurst, West Sussex, he spent his boyhood in Clevedon, Somerset. He studied art at the Reading School of Art (now University of Reading) and, from 1926 to 1929, at the Slade School of Fine Art. Henry Tonks was one of his tutors at the Slade and he shared rooms with William Townsend (who wrote of Hubert in his journals and other papers) during his time there. In the late 1930s, due to ill health, Hubert left London to live with his family in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. He was deeply affected by the deaths, between 1936 and 1947, of his father and two brothers. He continued to live with his mother until her death in about 1960. He then moved to Seaford, East Sussex. Hubert's lifelong shyness and introversion contributed to a neglect of his work in histories of twentieth century British art. When his close friend and colleague Geoffrey Tibble died in 1952, Hubert became reclusive and withdrew from the art world. Hubert continued to paint until shortly before his death on 25 January 1985.", "Hubert's early work was figurative, developing into both abstract and semi-figurative styles. Between 1933 and 1936, Hubert was a significant figure in the Objective Abstraction movement with Graham Bell, William Coldstream, Rodrigo Moynihan and Geoffrey Tibble. Hubert's 'Painting 1935-6' at the Tate is from this period. Many of the artists involved in Objective Abstraction went on to be part of the realist Euston Road School but Hubert continued to work in both abstract and semi-figurative styles."]}, {"page": "Objective abstraction", "response": ["The main figures were Graham Bell, William Coldstream, Edgar Hubert, Rodrigo Moynihan and Geoffrey Tibble.", "William Townsend told the Tate Gallery that 'the style originated with Geoffrey Tibble in the latter half of 1933. It was immediately taken up by Rodrigo Moynihan [...] and at the same time or shortly after by Edgar Hubert'. According to Townsend, early paintings by the group were derived from external objects but they became increasingly abstract.", "In 1934, the exhibition Objective Abstractions was held at the Zwemmer Gallery showing the group's work, except Hubert's. The exhibition catalogue states that Graham Bell, Rodrigo Moynihan, Ceri Richards, Ivon Hitchens, Geoffrey Tibble and Victor Pasmore exhibited paintings  "]}]}}
