Those are the only two ingredients in Delia Smith's 1987 recipe.D.

Like Smith, Dickson Wright specifies dripping (or lard) for frying, finding vegetable oil unsuitable for frying bubble and squeak, because the mixture will not brown adequately.

In 2020\u201321 it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for 2021\u201322. Majority-owned by celebrity chef Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is Carrow Road Stadium. It has strong East Anglian rivalry with Ipswich Town. The club has enjoyed much success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has won two Football League Cups, and finished third in the inaugural Premier League in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions. Perhaps its most famous result came in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants Bayern Munich from the UEFA Cup, in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but been unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated Manchester United from the FA Cup in 1959 and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some highly-rated talent of that era, including striker Chris Sutton, winger Ruel Fox, defender Andy Linighan, midfielder Mike Phelan, midfielder Tim Sherwood and striker Justin Fashanu. The club's successful managers have included Ken Brown, Ron Saunders, Dave Stringer, Mike Walker, Nigel Worthington and Paul Lambert."]}, {"page": "Isabella Beeton", "response": ["Beeton and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are \"sometimes slapdash and misleading\", although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagn\u00e9's Larousse Gastronomique also contains errors. The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled \"how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse\u00a0... [Acton's] superior work\", while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that \"It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for.\" In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Beeton's work was only a \"fashionable\" stance to take and that the cook's writing \"simply makes you want to cook\". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the \"relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930\" may instead be explained by the \"progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers\". David comments that \"when plain English cooks\" were active in their kitchens, \"they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives\". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a \"fascinating source of information\" from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be \"the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era\"."]}, {"page": "Fanny Cradock", "response": ["Marguerite Patten has described Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war.
