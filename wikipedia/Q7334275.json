He also appeared in first-class cricket for The Players (1924\u20131928), the North of England (1928) and Sir L Parkinson's XI (1933).\nBorn in Low Valley, Wombwell, Yorkshire, England, Kilner was a tough, professional right-handed batsman who scored 1,253 runs for Yorkshire at 18.98, with two centuries to his name.  He fared better after his move to Edgbaston, scoring 16,075 runs for Warwickshire at 31.89. Overall, in 403 first-class matches, he scored 17,522 runs at 30.36, with 25 centuries and a best score of 228 at New Road, Worcester in 1935, during which he scored a hundred before lunch. A fine fielder, he took 184 catches, and one wicket for 83 runs with his eccentric bowling. He once bowled three balls of an over right-handed, and three balls of it with his left.\nHis brother, Roy Kilner played Test cricket for England whilst his nephew, Irving Washington, also played for Yorkshire as a left-handed bat. Kilner was a familiar figure at Edgbaston after his retirement, often commenting on the match in his broad Yorkshire accent, in company with Tiger Smith.\nKilner died in April 1979 in Alum Rock, Birmingham, Warwickshire, aged 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maurice Leyland", "response": ["During the early 1920s, the Yorkshire committee was attempting to find players to replace those whose careers had ended with the First World War. Late in the 1920 season, Leyland made his first-class debut for Yorkshire, having played several times in the second team that summer. He played once, against Essex, scoring ten runs in his only innings, but this was his sole appearance that year. He had never previously attended a County Championship game. The following year, Leyland played in five first-team matches, scoring 52 not out against Leicestershire, averaging just over 19 for the season. In the latter part of the 1922 season he played more regularly, replacing Norman Kilner in the team. Although Leyland's batting figures were unimpressive, the summary of Yorkshire's season in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said he \"gave signs of promise as a forcing batsman and fielded very finely\". His highest score in 14 matches was 29, but he was awarded his county cap, and critics within Yorkshire judged him to have great potential."]}, {"page": "Kilner", "response": ["* Norman Kilner (1895\u20131979), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Irving Washington", "response": ["Born in Wombwell, Yorkshire, Washington was a left-handed batsman, who scored 1,384 runs at 21.96, in his 48 first-class games, with a best of 100 not out against Surrey, his only century.

The retirement of David Denton brought Edgar Oldroyd fully into the picture and Arthur Dolphin played less matches than previously as Reg Allen became the favoured wicket-keeper for a time.
