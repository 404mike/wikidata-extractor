He graduated from St John's College, Cambridge as Third Wrangler in 1850 and was elected a fellow of Christ's College in 1852. Collaborating with Percival Frost, a Treatise on Solid Geometry was published in 1863.Wolstenholme served as Examiner in 1854, 1856, and 1863 for Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, and according to Andrew Forsyth his book Mathematical Problems made a significant contribution to mathematical education:\n\n...gathered together from many examination papers to form a volume, which was considerably amplified in later editions, they exercised a very real influence upon successive generations of undergraduates; and \"Wolstenholme's Problems\" have proved a help and stimulus to many students.In 1869 he resigned his fellowship to marry T\u00e9r\u00e8se Kraus, his Swiss bride. \nHe became a professor of mathematics at the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, Egham, Surrey from 1871 to 1889. \nIn 1878 he published an expanded version of Mathematical Problems, and in 1888 Examples for Practice in the Use of Seven-figure Logarithms.\nHe was a close friend of Leslie Stephen from his undergraduate studies at Cambridge.
