He again had a short presidency and was replaced upon his death in 1961 by Sir Stanley Rous, a former referee. During Rous' presidency, the game continued to spread, with the World Cup appearing on television for the first time. Rous was a traditionalist, promoting the amateurism of the national game and a romantic view of \"Corinthian\" values. He helped make the World Cup one of the big international sports events, behind perhaps only the Olympic Games in worldwide prestige. His tenure was also marked with controversy, as he supported the South African apartheid regime, and worked to allow the country to participate in the World Cup, despite having been banned from CAF. This caused tensions between Rous and a number of FIFA confederations.", "| 5 || Arthur Drewry ||  || 1955\u20131961 "]}, {"page": "The Game of Their Lives (2005 film)", "response": ["*The reason Stanley Matthews was omitted from the England squad was because Arthur Drewry, head of the English Football League, decided to keep the same team that had won against Chile, not because \"he was taking a holiday in Rio\".
