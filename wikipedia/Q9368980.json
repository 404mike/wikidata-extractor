The publicity caused John Carden and Vivian Loyd to produce their own. Both types were developed further, but the two-man Carden Loyd tankette was considered the classic and most successful design, with many other tankettes modeled after it.  While the design was influential, few Carden Loyd tankettes saw combat, other than those the Bolivian side used during the Chaco War. However, the design did lead to the universal carrier, which had an extensive operational history in the Second World War.Fletcher & Bryan, p. 3"]}, {"page": "Vickers 6-Ton", "response": ["The first Mark E was built in 1928 by a design team that included the famed tank designers John Valentine Carden and Vivian Loyd.

With the publication of the idea, other companies produced their own interpretations of the idea. One of these was Carden-Loyd Tractors Ltd, a firm founded by Sir John Carden and Vivian Loyd and later purchased by Vickers-Armstrongs.
