The side's first win in more than a month, a 1\u20130 victory over fellow strugglers Everton lifted the side above the relegation zone. Concerned about his team's faltering performances, Stewart made several more additions to his squad in December, adding goalkeeper Tommy Hampson from Darlington and forwards Fred Castle and Frank Matson from Mid Rhondda and Reading respectively. Matson made his debut against Blackburn Rovers on 18 December and Castle against Newcastle a week later, but neither were able to stop the side falling to 1\u20130 and 5\u20130 defeats. Cardiff ended the calendar year with a 2\u20130 win over Arsenal following goals from Ferguson and Curtis.
