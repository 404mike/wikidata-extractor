A few months into the campaign, centre-half Ted Hough was signed from Talbot Stead Tubeworks, who were paid \u00a3200 and 52 pints of beer for his services. In January 1922, Sammy Meston \u2013 the son of former Southampton half-back Samuel Meston \u2013 joined from Sholing Athletic, and outside-right Robert Blyth signed from Portsmouth. In March, the club released two popular players to recently promoted First Division club Birmingham, who provided two of their own players in return. McIntyre's contributions were outside-left Fred Foxall and outside-right Joe Barratt, both of whom had played the majority of games up to that point, while their replacements were inside-left Jack Elkes and half-back George Getgood. Foxall had originally attempted to join top-flight side Aston Villa in May, but his transfer was reversed by the Football Association as Southampton had not given permission for the sale (he was also ordered to donate his signing-on fee to the National War Fund).", "!scope=\"row\"|Harry Hooper", "!scope=\"row\"|Harry Hooper"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Harry Hooper"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Harry Hooper"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["At the end of the 1923\u201324 season, Southampton brought in centre-half John Callagher and inside-forward Stan Woodhouse from Bury, who had just been promoted to the First Division as runners-up of the second flight.

In a similar deal, the Saints sold full-back Harry Hooper to divisional rivals Leicester City, in exchange for right-half Dennis Jones and outside-left Fred Price.
