Latterly his research has extended to Islamic architecture and its influence on Western traditions. He is Professor emeritus and an honorary life member of Birkbeck College, University of London where he is currently Visiting Professor in the History of Architecture. He has published numerous articles and books including The Formation of English Gothic : Architecture and Identity, for which he won two prestigious awards; the Spiro Kostof Book Award from the Society of Architectural Historians in 2008 and the Alice Davis Hitchcock Medallion in 2009, awarded by the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain.", "Peter Draper often takes his own photographs to illustrate his writing and, while he was at the Courtauld, he donated photographs to the Conway Library, whose archive, of primarily architectural images, is in the process of being digitised as part of the wider Courtauld Connects project. One of those photographs, of a hoodmold, has been used in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica as an example of that particular piece of architecture.", "* Artistic Integration in Gothic Buildings, eds.
