When Mancienne returned to Chelsea in the New Year, Collins returned to the side, partnering Richard Stearman. He contributed several important goals during this period, but was soon ousted from the side again after receiving a red card for dissent at Reading and following the addition of Scottish international Christophe Berra.

Perhaps the most memorable moment of his Hearts career came against Aberdeen as he scored an acrobatic overhead kick to give Hearts a 1\u20130 victory at Pittodrie on 27 February 2010. Due to the absence of captain Marius \u017dali\u016bkas and vice-captain Lee Wallace, Eggert was made captain for the 3\u20130 defeat to Celtic F.C. at Parkhead on 11 September 2010. He would go on to take the captain's armband for numerous matches while with the Jambos due to the unavailability of \u017dali\u016bkas. One such occasion came on 7 May 2011 as he was sent off for a challenge on Nikica Jelavi\u0107 in a 4\u20130 away loss against Rangers.
