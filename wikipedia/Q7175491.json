M. Barrie. Barrie publicly identified him as the source of the name for the title character in his 1904 play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up.  This public identification as \"the original Peter Pan\" plagued Davies throughout his life, which ended in suicide. He was the first cousin of the English writer Daphne du Maurier.\nHe was awarded the Military Cross after serving as an officer in World War I, and in 1926 founded the publishing house Peter Davies Ltd.", "link_mentions": {}}}
