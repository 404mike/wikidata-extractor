He became a key figure in the foundation and development of Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1863. He was the club's first Treasurer and soon afterwards became its President. Ellison was born in Worksop and died, aged 81, in Sheffield.Ellison played in 16 important matches as a right-handed batsman. He was judged a \"useful\" player only, scoring 195 runs in his 28 innings, averaging 6.96. He held one catch as a fielder and was an occasional bowler who took one wicket in 30 overs.Ellison's significance came after he stopped playing and undertook administrative responsibilities at Sheffield Cricket Club. In 1863, he played a major role in the foundation of Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Officially, the first Club President was former Sheffield player T. R. Barker, who was then the Lord Mayor of Sheffield, although he probably never attended any meetings. Ellison was the first Treasurer but he soon afterwards assumed the Presidency. Some accounts record Ellison as Yorkshire's first President. Ellison was instrumental in bringing Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke to the club. Hawke became Yorkshire's first amateur captain and Ellison gave him the task of transforming a talented but wayward team, often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\", into a winning one.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The first club President was former player Thomas Barker, who had become Mayor of Sheffield, although he probably never attended any meetings.
