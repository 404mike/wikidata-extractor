Having escaped from their knocked-out tank, Lieutenant John Cloudsley-Thompson and his crew of the 4th CLY spent much of the day in a basement in Villers-Bocage. They made their way back after dark and were picked up by troops of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division. During debriefing Cloudsley-Thompson said that he \"never wished to see another tank as long as [he] lived\" but the British press reported this as: \"The first thing the five tank men asked for was another tank\". Because the British had lost contact with the forces on Point 213 and withdrawn from Villers-Bocage, they were ignorant of the losses on both sides. The German propaganda machine swiftly credited Wittmann, a household name in Germany, with all the British tanks destroyed at Villers-Bocage."]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** John Cloudsley-Thompson, naturalist and army officer (died 2013)"]}, {"page": "British Naturalists' Association", "response": ["David Attenborough; Chris Baines; Trevor Beebee;  David Bellamy; Gordon Benningfield; John Clegg;  John Cloudsley-Thompson; Richard Fitter; Max Hooper; Harold Hughes; Simon King; Richard Mabey; George C.

One of the men was dragged away by the squid, and another, Lieutenant Raymond Edmund Grimani Cox, managed to narrowly escape the same fate, though suffering tentacle sucker wounds.Bernard Heuvelmans, In the Wake of the Sea Serpents, p.78Roland Hanewald, Das Tropenbuch. Jens Peters Publ., Berlin 1987, , S. 188. The chronicle of the survivors was first told in 1941 by the London Illustrated News, which stated that, according to the account given them by Cox, a survivor first had his legs bitten off by a shark and then was devoured by a giant manta,Wolf H. Berger, Ocean: Reflections on a Century of Exploration but in 1956, Cox himself contacted writer Frank W. Lane to tell his story. They required marine naturalist John Cloudsley-Thompson to examine Cox's scars at Birkbeck College, and the former further validated the story, assuring the marks, of 1-1/4 inches in size, belonged to a 23-feet long squid.Michael Bright, Man-Eaters: Horrifying True Stories of Savage, Flesh-Eating Predators... and their Human Prey!, 2013, St. Martin's Publishing Group, 9781466859692Bernard Heuvelmans, Kraken & The Colossal OctopusMysterious World, episode \"Monsters of the Deep\", 1978.
