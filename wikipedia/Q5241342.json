His family converted to the Anglican faith in the late 18th century and were amongst the first Jewish families to do so. This was in order to serve in official capacities within the British power structure, then prohibited to non-Anglicans. It appears that they did not have to do much with the Jewish community in England after that time. He was the youngest son of David Ximenes Senior of Bear Place at Hare Hatch, near Wargrave in Berkshire, and brother to Sir Morris Ximenes of the same place. He was present at the Battle of Waterloo. In England, he lived at Bear Ash, also at Hare Hatch in Berkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Morris Ximenes", "response": ["In 1794, after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, Ximenes raised a Troop of the 'Windsor Foresters' or Berkshire Fencible Cavalry, a home defence regiment, and was given the rank of captain. His brother David Ximenes, a half-pay captain in the Regular Army, was commissioned into the Foresters as a lieutenant in January 1795. The regiment served in Lincolnshire and Scotland on anti-invasion and anti-smuggling duties. When it was disbanded in 1800 Morris Ximenes sought permission to raise a 'Troop of Gentlemen Cavalry' (Yeomanry) in Berkshire. He offered to pay for its clothing and kit if the arms and accoutrements of the disbanded Windsor Foresters were transferred to it. Royal permission was granted through the Lord Lieutenant and the Wargrave Rangers was formed, with Ximenes as captain. All the Yeomanry were stood down at the Treaty of Amiens, but when war was resumed in 1803 the Wargrave Rangers were reactivated and the officers received new commissions in April. David Ximenes returned to full-pay service in the 29th Foot, and Morris raised sufficient recruits for him to obtain promotion to major. In August 1803 Morris Ximenes offered to raise and pay for a corps of volunteer infantry to be attached to the Wargrave Rangers with wagons to travel in. It is not known if this proposal was taken up. Sir Morris Ximenes (as he had now become) retired from command of the Wargrave Rangers in March 1809 when he was appointed to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 2nd Berkshire Local Militia.Cormack.War Office, List of the officers.Ron McGuigan, Fencible Cavalry Regiments (of Light Dragoons) 1794\u20131799 at Napoleon Series.
