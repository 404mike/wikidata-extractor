As part of this memorial, a cross with panels by Elizabeth Dempster was mounted on the east wall of the Aisle. Other notable memorials of the Second World War include Basil Spence's large wooden plaque to the 94th (City of Edinburgh) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (1954) in the north choir aisle and the nearby Church of Scotland chaplains memorial (1950): this depicts Saint Andrew in bronze relief and was manufactured by Charles Henshaw.", "The current organ replaced a Harrison & Harrison organ of 1878, the first organ in the church since the Reformation. This organ initially possessed 2 manuals and 26 stops. Between 1872 and this organ's installation, a harmonium was used in services. Harrison & Harrison rebuilt the organ in 1883 and 1887. Eustace Ingram rebuilt the organ as a 4 manual, 60 stop instrument in 1895. Ingram & Co rebuilt the organ in 1909 and overhauled it between 1936 and 1939. The organ was reconstructed in 1940 by Henry Willis & Sons as a 4 manual, 74 stop instrument with a new console and an extra console in the Moray Aisle; a new case was designed by Esm\u00e9 Gordon: this incorporated statues of angels and Jubal by Elizabeth Dempster.Marshall 2009, p. 158. The second console was removed in 1980 and Willis overhauled the organ in 1982. The organ was removed in 1990, some of the pipes were removed to the McEwan Hall, Peebles Old Parish Church, and the Scottish Theatre Organ Preservation Trust; two were incorporated in the replacement organ; the console was donated to a church in Perth.Marshall 2009, pp. 186-187."]}, {"page": "National Library of Scotland", "response": ["Grant's support was recognised with a baronetcy, and in June 1924 he became Sir Alexander Grant of Forres. In 1928 he donated a further \u00a3100,000 \u2013 making his combined donations the equivalent of around \u00a36 million today \u2013 for a new library building to be constructed on George IV Bridge, replacing the Victorian-period Sheriff Court, which moved to the Royal Mile. Government funding was secured which matched Grant's donation. Work on the new building was started in 1938, interrupted by World War II, and completed in 1956. The architect was Reginald Fairlie; the architectural sculptor was Hew Lorimer. The coat of arms above the entrance was sculpted by Scott Sutherland and the roundels above the muses on the front facade by Elizabeth Dempster."]}, {"page": "Charles Warr", "response": ["They had no children but were guardians of the Scottish sculptor Elizabeth Dempster."]}, {"page": "Mary Syme Boyd", "response": ["Boyd bequeathed Kestrel to the National Galleries of Scotland as representative of her life's work. \"Bird sculptures often took the form of an outstretched-winged hunting bird on a rocky outcrop, usually with a tiny victim writhing in its claws, or in territorial combat with another bird. Boyd's Kestrel, however, eschews these narrative orthodoxies and aligns instead with modernist principles, choosing to depict this bird as a benign creature. Carved from wood, Kestrel's simple lines and unadorned surface serve to illustrate that Boyd was aware of modernist discourse involving 'truth to materials', espoused by Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth at this time.\"Included in the bequest were two additional sculptures: one by Elizabeth Dempster and one by Georg Kolbe."]}, {"page": "Dempster, Elizabeth", "response": ["#redirectElizabeth Dempster"]}]}}
