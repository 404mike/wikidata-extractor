He played international cricket for the England cricket team, including appearing in three Test matches and spent the majority of his first-class cricket career at Kent County Cricket Club. Saggers was born in King's Lynn in Norfolk.\nSaggers had little success in his three seasons with Durham between 1996 and 1998, but then joined Kent and from 2000 to 2003 took more than 50 first-class wickets each year, his best being 83 in 2002. He also played for Essex on loan in 2007. He played for his native Norfolk in minor county matches in 1995\u20136.\nSaggers made his Test match debut in 2003/04, as a replacement for the injured Andrew Flintoff in Dhaka, and also played in two of the three Tests against New Zealand the following summer. At Leeds he took the wicket of Mark Richardson with his first ball, but some wayward bowling and poor performances with the bat led to his being dropped for the games against West Indies. With the bat, he scored 1, 0 and 0 in three innings, finishing his Test career with a batting average of 0.33.Saggers suffered a knee injury in August 2009, and a month later announced his retirement from professional cricket. Graham Johnson, Kent's chairman of cricket, paid tribute to Saggers, saying \"We owe Martin a great deal, especially during a period when he was our seam attack. Quite rightly, on the basis of this success, he received recognition at International level. Always enthusiastic and positive during his career, he will carry these qualities into his plans for what follows after cricket\".In 2012 Saggers became a full-time cricket umpire, standing in County Championship matches in England.In 2020, he was appointed to the ICC International Umpires' Panel. In January 2022, he was named as one of the on-field umpires for the 2022 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 23", "response": ["*  1972   \u2013 Martin Saggers, English cricketer and umpire"]}, {"page": "Durham County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Martin Saggers"]}, {"page": "Essex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Martin Saggers"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Nick Knight scored 122 off 125, the highest score of the National League season thus far, to boot the Bears up to 279 for 7 off their 45 overs.

Kent were set a target of 51 in their second innings, which they achieved without loss of a wicket to win inside three days. Kent were deducted half a point for a slow over rate.
