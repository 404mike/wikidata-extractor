Inspiration also came from Delius's own experiences as a young man, when his family sent him to work in Florida. It was Delius's third opera, and he thought better of it than of its predecessors, Irmelin and The Magic Fountain, because of the incorporation of dance scenes and his treatment of the choruses.Redwood, Christopher, \"Delius in the Opera House\" (June 1984).  The Musical Times, 12 (1696): 319, 321.
