In his professional career he played for Darlington, Northampton Town, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield United, Sunderland and Blyth Spartans.\nAt his first club, Sunderland, he was part of two Division One title winning teams which won promotion to the FA Premier League, and while he was at Sunderland he made his only appearance for the England under-21 side on 15 November 1994.Many Northampton Town supporters regard Smith as one of the most technically gifted players ever to represent the club. He memorably scored the winner in a FA Cup 3rd Round replay away at Rotherham in January 2004 giving the Cobblers a 4th round tie at home to Manchester United.\nSmith joined Darlington ahead of the 2006\u201307 season. Sunderland born Smith started his career on Wearside. Dubbed 'The Son of Pele' by Sunderland fanzine A Love Supreme (fanzine), he scored twenty-eight times in 107 starts for the North East giants in a seven-year spell, moving to Sheffield United (scoring fifteen times in 30 starts for the Blades), before joining Huddersfield Town.\nSmith went on to score thirty goals in seventy-five starts, including seventeen during the 2002\u201303 season as the Terriers were relegated. He signed for Northampton Town from Huddersfield Town on 1 July 2003 after being chased for a few months by their then manager Martin Wilkinson. Smith started as a forward; however in recent seasons he has been used as a midfielder, continuing to regularly find the net for Northampton during their promotion from League Two during the 2005\u201306 season.\nAt the end of that season the then Northampton Town manager Colin Calderwood left for Nottingham Forest. Smith enjoyed a good relationship with Calderwood and although new Northampton Town manager John Gorman worked hard to try to keep Smith at the Sixfields Stadium, Darlington (managed at the time by David Hodgson) eventually got their man.\nOn 19 March 2008, Smith's contract with Darlington was cancelled. On 29 August 2008 Martin Smith signed for Conference North side Blyth Spartans and made his debut the next day in the 3\u20130 win against Hucknall Town coming on as a late sub.\nIn August 2010 he signed for Kettering Town F.C. on non-contract terms.In February 2015, he made an appearance, alongside another former professional, David Duke, for Sassco.co.uk in their victory over Sunderland Deaf FC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.", "response": ["|2003|| Martin Smith"]}, {"page": "Martin Smith", "response": ["Martin Smith may refer to:", "*Martin Smith (drummer) (1946\u20131997), British drummer for Gentle Giant and Simon Dupree and the Big Sound", "*Martin Smith (potter) (born 1950), English potter and professor of ceramics and glass", "*Martin Smith (entertainer) (1957\u20131994), British actor, singer and composer", "*Martin Smith (documentarian) (born 1949), American filmmaker for the series Frontline", "*Martin Smith (English musician) (born 1970), English vocalist, guitarist and songwriter, previously front man of Delirious?", "*Martin Smith (film maker), Scottish BAFTA winning writer/director of Tracks", "*Martin Smith (activist) (born 1963), British political activist", "*Martin Smith (swimmer) (born 1958), British swimmer", "*Martin Smith (footballer, born 1974), British former professional footballer", "*Martin Smith (snooker player) (born 1961), British snooker player", "*Martin Smith (footballer, born 1995), British footballer", "*Martin Smith (figure skater) (born 1968), Canadian ice dancer", "*Martin Smith (academic), British Professor of Robotics at Middlesex University, and President of the Cybernetics Society, London, UK", "*Martin Smith (designer) (born 1949), British automobile designer", "*Martin Smith (Royal Marines officer) (born 1962), Commandant General Royal Marines"]}, {"page": "Simon Baldry", "response": ["The Huddersfield Examiner provided coverage of the game and there were appearances from former Town favourites Kevin Gray, Rodney Rowe, Martin Smith, Rob Edwards, Jon Dyson, Chris Billy and Club Ambassador Andy Booth amongst others."]}, {"page": "Riccardo Gabbiadini", "response": ["In the Northern section of Masters Football 2011 he represented Sunderland along with brother Marco however he failed to score and Sunderland failed to qualify from the group stages.

At the turn of the year, with the side suffering a blip in form, manager Bruce accepted the BBC's offer to cover previous club Manchester United's involvement in the much-derided FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil. With Town's form suffering, his popularity with the club's supporters plummeted. A run of 2 wins in 13 games didn't help things much either. Also during that run star striker Marcus Stewart was surprisingly sold to fellow 1st Division side Ipswich Town for a record fee of \u00a32.75million. Less than a month later, he scored Ipswich's winning goal in a 2-1 win between the sides at Portman Road. Town signed Sheffield United's striker Martin Smith.
