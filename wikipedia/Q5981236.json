During his career he made 69 appearances for West Bromwich Albion, winning the FA Cup in 1968, before moving to Ipswich Town in 1969 where he made 92 league appearances under the management of Bobby Robson. He had a loan spell at Portsmouth near the end of his time at Portman Road, before leaving the club in 1976 and calling time on his professional career at the age of 29.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1967 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["QPR continued to be outplayed for the most part by their First Division opponents. In the twenty fifth minute, Clark once again ran with the ball down the left hand side of the pitch, outrunning QPR's Ron Hunt, before crossing it into the path of Jeff Astle. His subsequent shot was saved by QPR goalkeeper Peter Springett, who managed to push the ball around the post. QPR briefly had a chance for a counterattack as Mark Lazarus found himself on the halfway line with the ball, before taking it around Ian Collard and found the Albion defence out of position, leaving him with a clear path to goal. But the opposition players were gaining on him as he approached the penalty area, with the attack falling apart shortly afterwards. Nine minutes before half time, QPR found themselves under attack by Albion again with some cross pitch passing resulting in Clark's second goal of the game. QPR had a corner just before half time which fell to the feet of club captain Mike Keen, but his shot went off the post. The game went into half time at 2\u20130 to Albion.", "| MF ||4 ||\u00a0Ian Collard"]}, {"page": "1968 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|OR ||8 || Ian Collard"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Football League Cup", "response": ["| ||4 ||Ian Collard"]}, {"page": "Music Victoria Awards of 2014", "response": ["**Ian Collard - Swamp, Stomp & Boogie"]}]}}
