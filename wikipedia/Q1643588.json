Another possibility is documented in the game manual, where Kurt's mission is named \"Mission: Deliver Kindness\". It could also stand for the first initials of the game's characters; Max, Dr. Hawkins, and Kurt.

In the Japanese release, on the back cover it says in bold yellow letters: \"My Dear Knight\". During the installation of MDK2, various meanings are shown, again including \"Murder, Death, Kill\". The original meaning of \"MDK\" from the company's initial promo video was in fact \"Murder Death Kill\".

After the basic features of the game had been completed, James Phinney, lead designer and producer of Blizzard's 1998 real-time strategy game StarCraft, was hired to write the plot for the single-player campaign. His first draft was used as the script for recording placeholder voiceovers, which helped the team to judge the atmosphere in the game. Later, Shiny employed professional actors, such as Tim Curry and Brad Garrett, and various voice artists, such as Jennifer Hale, to record the final voices for the game's characters. Audio filters altered the voices for the gods, giving them a supernatural edge appropriate to their roles. For background music, Shiny hired Kevin Manthei, who had composed many scores for video games and big- and small-screen entertainment, such as Scream 3 and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. His compositions for Sacrifice were played by an orchestra of 25\u00a0instruments.

Development for the game started in 1996, shortly after the release of Shiny's Earthworm Jim 2, and spanned three years. Initial ideas for the game included having a female character who possessed a special glove that could instantly vaporize enemies. From there, the idea progressed to an item that could do hand-like motions, only with 1,000 times the strength of a typical human, before it finally evolved into the game's final premise of a male character, Wex, who controlled the \"Rig\". The game initially started up development for the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation, however, the Saturn version was cancelled early in development. Perry's disillusionment with Sega of America's Saturn strategy was cited as the reason for the cancellation. Shortly after, Perry posted online that development on the Saturn version would resume if and when he was satisfied that Sega of America were making the Saturn a commercially viable platform.
