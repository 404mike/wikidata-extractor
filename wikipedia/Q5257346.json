He returned to British football in 1927\u201328 with a move to Wigan Borough, and then finished his career back in Scotland with Clyde and Brechin City.In 1923 Lawson was capped for Scotland, in a 2\u20132 draw with England at Hampden Park.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lennoxtown", "response": ["*Denis Lawson, born 1897"]}, {"page": "Billy Grimshaw", "response": ["He scored one of Cardiff's goals on the day of their first ever Football League victory, a 3\u20130 win over Stockport County on 4 September 1920.

The high-profile departures included Jack Evans, the club's first professional signing in 1910 who had been with the side for 16 years. Also leaving were Cassidy, less than a year after his \u00a33,800 move and for a fee described in The Times as \"substantially less\" than the one paid for him, and Joe Nicholson, who had led the club's attack in the 1925 FA Cup Final. Several fringe players also left the club, including Herbie Evans, Alfie Hagan, Joe Hills, Denis Lawson, Jack Page and Ebor Reed. However, the most significant departure was club captain Jimmy Blair who joined A.F.C. Bournemouth for \u00a33,900. His sale resulted in Fred Keenor being appointed the new captain of the first team. He had served as vice-captain under Blair and had filled the role on numerous occasions and was a popular choice for the position. Upon his appointment, the Football Echo remarked that Keenor was \"a leader in every sense of the word, he commands respect of colleagues and sets an inspiring example by his wholehearted enthusiasm.\""]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Having surrendered first place to Huddersfield Town, Cardiff retook the position by defeating West Bromwich Albion with a brace from Gill and one from Herbie Evans. In the reverse fixture against West Brom a week later, Len Davies became the first Cardiff player to score four goals in a Football League match when he scored all of his side's goals in a 4\u20132 victory. Back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City yielded consecutive 1\u20131 draws. In the first tie, Cardiff were deemed lucky to have gained a point with The Times stating, \"the balance of play was all against them\". Billy Grimshaw had given Cardiff the lead with a \"speculative\" long shot with Manchester City equalising in the final 15 minutes. In the second tie, Scottish forward Denis Lawson made his debut having signed from St Mirren although he was described as not playing \"a very distinguished game\". The arrival of Lawson ultimately led to the departure of Grimshaw after the club received an offer of \u00a34,000 from fellow First Division side Sunderland. Grimshaw had made over 45 appearances in the previous two seasons and had been ever present prior to Lawson's signing but the chance to recoup a significant transfer fee proved too tempting for the club's board.", "! scope=row|Denis Lawson"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Cardiff started the season with a goalless draw away to Burnley on 30 August 1924 and a 1\u20131 draw with Sheffield United two days later. Cardiff were one of several to begin the season slowly, including FA Cup holders Newcastle United, with The Times reporting that the expectant teams' \"preconceived ideas have been rudely shaken\". The previous four season's top goalscorer Len Davies, who had scored Cardiff's first goal of the season against Sheffield, added a brace to provide his side with their first victory in the following fixture, defeating newly-promoted Leeds United 3\u20131; Denis Lawson added a third with all three goals scored in the second half. However, two successive defeats followed, 1\u20130 in the reverse fixture against Sheffield United and 2\u20131 against Birmingham, that left the side in 14th position after winning only one of their opening five fixtures. The Times stated that the side had started the season in \"unpromising style\" and attributed the downturn in fortunes to a \"flaw in the link between the forwards and the half-backs\". The newspaper did however predict that \"better results are now likely to be achieved.\" The team's poor start was partly attributed to a series of injuries and illness that saw Len Davies, Jack Evans, Jimmy Nelson and Harry Wake miss several matches."]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["A 1\u20130 defeat in the reverse fixture against West Ham was followed by the club's first point away from home as they drew 1\u20131 with Huddersfield Town. Cardiff took the lead through Willie Davies before Clem Stephenson equalised. Nelson had the opportunity to win the match for Cardiff but failed to convert a penalty in the second half. In their next match, Cardiff defeated in-form Tottenham Hotspur, inflicting their opponents' first defeat of the season with goals from Davies and Denis Lawson. However, the team soon entered a poor run of form, losing the return fixture against Tottenham 1\u20130 before being defeated by the same scoreline against league leaders Sunderland. This was followed by a heavy 6\u20133 defeat against Blackburn Rovers. The club enjoyed a brief respite by defeating Bury 3\u20132 with goals from Joe Nicholson, Len Davies and Beadles, although The Times noted it was \"strange to find a team so good as Cardiff City so near the bottom of the table.\" Three straight defeats followed. The run began with a defeat against Birmingham in which Stewart experimented with team selection, including defender Fred Keenor at centre-forward. Cardiff took a 2\u20130 lead with goals from Willie Davies and Keenor but Birmingham recovered to take the victory, winning 3\u20132. A 5\u20130 defeat against Arsenal and a 2\u20130 loss against Manchester United left Cardiff bottom of the table at the end of October."]}]}}
