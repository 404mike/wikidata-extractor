Sectioned and detained at St John's Hospital, Stone, Buckinghamshire in 1935, he was then moved to the Maudsley Hospital in London, and finally, to Claybury. He disliked his treatment at the first two, and satirised the Maudsley psychiatrists, but he enjoyed the humane therapy at Claybury (though there is a signed drawing by him in the Tate of staff stealing from a patient in Claybury). In the course of his illness he produced several pictures that depicted his mental state. Before leaving Claybury in 1938, the medical superintendent, Guy Barham, agreed to him painting a large mural covering three walls of the canteen. A photograph of this painting was rediscovered circa 2015.

In Pegu he met Thomas Hennell, another British war artist, and the two worked together for a short time. Cole made several paintings of liberated prisoners of war, including individuals who had lost limbs or were recovering from beriberi or from being starved.

In total WAAC acquired artworks from some four hundred artists. It also issued permits allowing artists access to otherwise restricted areas and rationed materials. Wartime rationing restricted good quality paper for printmaking and materials for sculpture so such works were under-represented in the WAAC collection. In June 1941, WAAC established a scheme to obtain artworks by artists from Britain's overseas colonies. Although four artists were sent to record the activities of the British Expeditionary Force in France, at the start of the war the majority of WAAC commissions were for subjects on the British home front, but as the conflict progressed twenty-six men were given overseas commissions. Among these were Edward Ardizzone, Henry Carr, and Edward Bawden who each went to the Middle East, Leslie Cole was sent to Malta, France and South-East Asia, Vivian Pitchforth went to Burma, and Anthony Gross went to the Middle East and Burma before joining the Normandy landings. Two women, Mary Kessell and Laura Knight, were also, towards the end of the war, given overseas commissions. Other artists serving overseas but working without a WAAC commission or contract, submitted work which was then purchased by the Committee. These included Doris Zinkeisen and Stella Schmolle serving with the Red Cross and the Auxiliary Territorial Service respectively. Three artists, Thomas Hennell, Eric Ravilious and Albert Richards, were killed during the Second World War whilst working on WAAC commissions.", "* Thomas Hennell"]}, {"page": "List of Old Bradfieldians", "response": ["*Thomas Hennell (1903\u20131945), artist"]}, {"page": "Horkey", "response": ["By 1934, the artist Thomas Hennell was commenting that \"since the passing of the Agricultural Wages Bill, the Horkey has been generally abandoned, though one or two landowners in the eastern counties are still generous enough to give a supper each year\".Change in the Farm (1934), quoted in Village Life and Labour, an anthology, Cambridge University 2011, pp.92-3 There was, nevertheless, one revival at the end of the 20th century by the Morris Men of the Suffolk village of Glemsford.The Morris Men of Little Egypt"]}, {"page": "Hennell, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Hennell"]}, {"page": "Hennell", "response": ["* Thomas Hennell (1903\u20131945), artist and writer"]}]}}
