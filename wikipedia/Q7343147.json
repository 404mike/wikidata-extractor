He is best remembered as the co-author of the light opera Tom Jones (1907) and the producer of The Arcadians (1909).  He was the father of the actress Cicely Courtneidge, who played in many of his early 20th century productions.\nCourtneidge began as a comic actor in the late 1870s, working with Kate Santley, George Edwardes and others. In the early 1890s, he toured in Australia with Edwardes and J. C. Williamson companies. In 1896, he became a theatre manager in Manchester and then a West End theatre producer. In the first years of the 20th century, he began to direct musical theatre pieces and to write or co-write the book for some of his productions, including Tom Jones (1907). His most popular productions included The Arcadians (1909), Princess Caprice (1912), Oh! Oh! Delphine (1913) and The Cinema Star (1914). He directed the hit musical The Boy in 1917.\nAfter the war, he presented Paddy the Next Best Thing, which had a long run, and then took a touring company to Australia, presenting a repertory of comedies.  In the 1920s, he returned to producing British provincial tours and became the lessee of the Savoy Theatre, presenting a mixture of productions ranging from Shakespeare to farce.  A lifelong socialist, he joined with other managers in campaigning for fair pay and treatment of actors.  He also returned briefly to acting.  Later in the decade, he presented more West End musicals and operettas, producing his last show in 1930.  In 1933 he wrote a novel, Judith Clifford.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward German", "response": ["German returned to writing comic operas, achieving another success with Tom Jones for the Apollo Theatre in 1907, produced by Robert Courtneidge for the Fielding bicentenary. The score is one of German's finest works. It received a production in New York, with German conducting, and was performed for decades, spawning separate performances of its dance music. He next collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on his final (and unsuccessful) opera, Fallen Fairies, at the Savoy in 1909. With German's agreement, Gilbert cast his protege, Nancy McIntosh, as the Fairy Queen, Selene. Critics found her performance weak. Shortly after the opening, the producer C. H. Workman, acting at the request of the syndicate he had gathered, replaced McIntosh with Amy Evans and asked for restoration of a song that Gilbert had cut during rehearsals. Gilbert was outraged and threatened to sue, demanding that German join him. This placed German in a distressing position, and the composer, who habitually preferred to avoid legal battles, declined.Morrison, Robert. \"The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera\",  Fallen Fairies, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006) In maintaining the Savoy tradition of comic opera, German was composing a style of piece for which public taste had dwindled as fashions in musical theatre had changed with the new century."]}, {"page": "Savage Club", "response": ["*Robert Courtneidge"]}, {"page": "Herbert Marshall", "response": ["While his stage debut is usually listed as The Adventure of Lady Ursula (1911),\"News of Stage, Screen, and Music: Edna Best Forsook Film Fame to Be With Husband, Herbert Marshall\" (1932 October 10).

Meanwhile, one can accept In a cheerful spirit this new vehicle for Miss Courtneldge's comic gifts. The actress has spent some time on the variety stage. So much becomes at once apparent when she begins to move on the screen. Her performance is one long romp, in which she fools to her heart's content, and continually sacrifices development of character to effect's of burlesque...Not even her most rabid admirers would claim that she Is beautiful, either in feature or in form. It is her very angularity and her frank, genial homeliness which cause patrons of theatres to love her. The more undignified she can make herself look the better pleased she seems to be, and It Is good policy; for some of her strokes of grotesquerie are calculated to make any audience laugh its head off.
