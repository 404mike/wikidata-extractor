He is most famous for his excavations at Great Zimbabwe which provided the first solid evidence that the site was built by Shona peoples.\nRandall-MacIver was educated at The Queens College, Oxford. He graduated in 1896 with a first class degree. He began his professional archaeological career in 1898 working for Flinders Petrie in Egypt, uncovering the mortuary temple of Senwosret III at Abydos. In 1906 he was appointed as Curator of the Egyptian Section at the Penn Museum, University of Pennsylvania, taking charge of the collection following Sara Yorke Stevenson's resignation in 1905.With funding from Eckley B. Coxe Jr., Randall-MacIver initiated research into the relationship between Egypt and Nubia, uncovering some of the earliest evidence of ancient Nubian culture, dating back to 3100 BCE. Between 1905 and 1906 Randall-MacIver conducted the first detailed study of Great Zimbabwe. The absence of any artefacts of non-African origin led him to conclude that the structure was built by local people. Earlier scholars had speculated that the structure had been built by Arab or Phoenician traders. Between 1907 and 1910 he excavated the site of Karanog, a former provincial capital of the Kingdom of Kush.\nRandall-MacIver left the Penn Museum in 1911 following a disagreement with new Museum Director George Byron Gordon, becoming librarian of the American Geographical Society. In 1914 he left the AGS to work as a British intelligence officer in the First World War. In 1921 he moved to Italy to study Etruscan archaeology. He remained in Italy during World War II, assisting the Allied forces Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, the famous \"Monuments Men\", to preserve historical monuments and cultural property.Randall-MacIver died in New York City on 30 April 1945.He is memorialised in the Parte Antica of the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Zimbabwe", "response": ["thumb|right|Exterior wall of the Great Enclosure.

In Medieval Rhodesia, he wrote of the existence in the site of objects that were of Bantu origin. More importantly he suggested a wholly medieval date for the walled fortifications and temple.  This claim was not immediately accepted, partly due to the relatively short and undermanned period of excavation he was able to undertake."]}, {"page": "Flinders Petrie", "response": ["From 1889-99 Petrie directed a team excavating over 17 cemeteries containing numerous graves between Hu and Abadiya, Egypt.

The site contained three sets of structures which contained multiple buildings. Known since the 16th century, Great Zimbabwe had been previously excavated by James Theodore Bent and David Randall-MacIver and controversy raged as to whether the site was the work of Africans (MacIver's view) or of some other civilisation. Caton Thompson assembled an all female expedition for the Zimbabwe excavations, which was the first of its kind. Caton Thompson used ceramics, which were similar to what modern villagers were using, and structures like terrace walls to determine who built the structures from the site. Working with Kathleen Kenyon, Caton Thompson's excavations led her to the unequivocal view that Zimbabwe was the product of a \"native civilisation\". The assertion attracted considerable negative press attention and was received negatively by many within the archaeological community. Caton Thompson claimed to keep hostile letters from local experts in a file marked \"insane\". Modern archaeologists now agree that the city was the product of a Shona-speaking African civilisation."]}, {"page": "Leonard Woolley", "response": ["Woolley next traveled to Nubia where he worked with David Randall-MacIver on the Eckley Coxe Expedition to Nubia conducted under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.

The division of schools corresponds very closely to the old pre-Roman distribution of the region into three sections. Of these the most northern is Daunia, extending from the promontory of Gargano to the most southern point in the course of the river Aufidus; next to which is Peucetia, which for purposes of this classification may be said to begin at Bari and end at Egnatia. South of a line drawn from Egnatia to Taranto, the whole heel of Italy, with Lecce at its centre, is Messapia. thumb|left|The heel of Italy with its ancient colonies  Each of these regions has its own peculiar and well marked style in pottery. The chronology of all three is not precisely concurrent; actually the Daunian school is dated from about 600 to 450BC and the Peucetian from 650 to 500BC, while the Messapian only begins at 500BC and lasts for two centuries. Wholly distinct is a much later Daunian school confined to Canosa, which belongs to the fourth and third centuries and may be called late-Canosan.Cf.
