Although she lived most of her life in England and died in France, her compositional style was strongly influenced by the African music remembered from her childhood. She never adopted 12-tone or serial techniques, but her music shows a profound understanding of that musical language. She can be credited with the first truly athematic works composed in England.  Her Cello Concerto was premiered by Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 in 1964, and her Violin Concerto Due Canti e Finale was premiered by Yehudi Menuhin in 1977.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Donne", "response": ["Prose texts by Donne have also been set to music.
