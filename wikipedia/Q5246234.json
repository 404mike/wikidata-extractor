Torquay found it hard to get a foothold in the first half of the game and eventually fell behind in the 39th minute to a Matt Tubbs strike.  However, worse was to follow in the second period when Chris Zebroski was sent off in the 61st minute for a second bookable offence after a handball in the six yard box.  However, when keeper Scott Bevan managed to save the resulting penalty from Tubbs, the Gulls spirits were raised again until another penalty was awarded to Crawley just minutes later.  Astonishingly, Bevan pulled off his second penalty save of the match, this time from Craig McAllister, to give Torquay another lifeline.  Unfortunately, they were unable to capitalise on Bevan's heroics and, despite the sending off of Dean Howell for Crawley in the 83rd minute, the score remained 1\u20130 until the final whistle.  In a match which saw seven bookings in addition to the two dismissals, many Torquay supporters were angered by the tactics employed by Crawley manager Steve Evans (two of Crawley's yellow cards were for time wasting) and their misery was compounded the following day when Evans\u2019 men were rewarded with a trip to Old Trafford to play Manchester United in the Fifth Round draw."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Dean Howell", "|Dean Howell", "|align=\"left\"|Dean Howell", "|Dean Howell"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|6 ||DF || ||3 ||Dean Howell || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3", "|3 || ||DF ||Dean Howell || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dean Howell"]}, {"page": "Vegfest (UK)", "response": ["The Brighton event began in 2009, and since 2010 has taken place annually in March at the Hove Centre.
