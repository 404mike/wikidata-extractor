He was influential in the early development of statistical methods in plant communities. He worked as researcher and professor in England, Australia, Ghana and the United States. He was editor-in-chief of the 30-volume Ecosystems of the World series of books, and author of over 100 publications. He was known as Australia's oldest working scientist, still editing ecology papers at age 103. Long an advocate of voluntary euthanasia legalisation, he ended his own life in Switzerland via physician-assisted suicide at age 104.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 10", "response": ["*2018 \u2013 David Goodall, Australian botanist and ecologist (b. 1914)"]}, {"page": "2018", "response": ["* May 10 \u2013 David Goodall, English-Australian scientist (b. 1914)"]}, {"page": "List of suicides", "response": ["* David Goodall (2018), English-born Australian botanist and ecologist, physician-assisted suicide"]}, {"page": "Right to die", "response": ["* David Goodall"]}, {"page": "Goodall", "response": ["* David Goodall (botanist) (1914\u20132018), Australian botanist and ecologist", "* David Goodall (diplomat) (1931\u20132016), British diplomat", "* David Goodall (director) (born 1964), Scottish film director, producer and actor", "* David Goodall (chemist), British chemist"]}, {"page": "David Goodall", "response": ["David Goodall may refer to:", "* David Goodall (botanist) (1914\u20132018), Australian botanist, ecologist, and advocate of legalized voluntary euthanasia", "* David Goodall (diplomat) (1931\u20132016), British diplomat", "* David Goodall (director) (born 1964), Scottish film director, producer and actor", "* David Goodall (chemist), British chemist, professor emeritus at University of York "]}, {"page": "April 1914", "response": ["* Born: Marguerite Duras, French writer and film director, author of The Sea Wall and Hiroshima mon amour, in Saigon, French Indochina (d. 1996); Richard Coogan, American actor, best known for the title role in the film serial Captain Video and His Video Rangers from 1949 to 1950, in Short Hills, New Jersey (d. 2014); David Goodall, British-Australian biologist, editor of the Ecosystems of the World book series, in Edmonton, London, England (d. 2018)"]}, {"page": "List of suicides in the 21st century", "response": ["|David Goodall"]}, {"page": "2018 in Australia", "response": ["*10 May \u2013 David Goodall, 104, English-born botanist and ecologist (died in Switzerland)"]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**David Goodall, 104, English-born botanist and ecologist"]}, {"page": "2018 in England", "response": ["**David Goodall, 104, English-born botanist and ecologist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2018", "response": ["*David Goodall, 104, English-born Australian botanist, assisted suicide by lethal injection.David Goodall, 104-Year-Old Australian Scientist, Dies in Switzerland"]}, {"page": "David W.

After the publication of his book Quantitative Plant Ecology in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators.
