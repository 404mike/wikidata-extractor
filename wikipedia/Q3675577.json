He is a four-time runner-up in the British Superbike Championship, and a former race winner in the Superbike World Championship. For the 2015 season Walker signed for Tommy Hill's Be Wiser Kawasaki Team aboard a Kawasaki ZX-10R in the British Superbike Championship, following his 2014 season with Lloyds British GBmoto squad. Team manager Hill left in August, 2015, and the team folded in September, leaving Walker without a ride for the final two race meetings of the season.In early 2016, Walker announced he would no longer participate in superbikes, instead switching to the British Sidecar Championship, initially with a two-year contract. With no previous experience, Walker stated he was excited by the future opportunities.Like Formula One legend Ayrton Senna, Walker developed Bell's Palsy in 2002 which paralysed part of his face. He lists his determination as his best feature, and his love of puddings as his worst. He usually races #9.\nHe returned to the grid in 2021 taking on the Ducati TriOptions Cup.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mallory Park", "response": ["|  Chris Walker", "|  Chris Walker", "|  Chris Walker", "|  Chris Walker", "|  Chris Walker"]}, {"page": "James Ellison (motorcyclist)", "response": ["After racing during 2013 with Milwaukee Yamaha run by Shaun Muir Racing in British Superbikes, for 2014 Ellison joined Lloyds British GBmoto team, and rode a Kawasaki ZX-10R alongside veteran Chris Walker.
