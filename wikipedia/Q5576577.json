His career as a theatre actor began as a boy at the Haymarket Theatre and he appeared in many plays and films. He went on to write a number of novels and biographical works, and became a star columnist for the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Express newspapers, where he wrote \"Dear Abby\" articles for lovelorn women. Journalists nicknamed him 'Winifred God' because of his popularity with women readers. Winn was homosexual and never married.In 1939, Winn was the first British war correspondent to cross the Maginot Line. He served as a Royal Navy able seaman, during the Second World War, training at HMS Ganges and becoming a CW (Commission Candidate Wartime) before injury led to his medical discharge. His book 'Home From Sea' published in 1943 recounts his life in the Royal Navy. Another book, PQ17, was an account of his experiences, as a journalist, on Convoy PQ 17 during the Second World War. After the war, he wrote numerous books and magazine articles, and appeared on radio and television as well as in films. He frequently compered the BBC Radio show Housewives' Choice, with David Jacobs, from the early 1950s to the mid 1960s. He was a friend of W. Somerset Maugham and it is said that the character George Potter in Maugham's 1941 book Strictly Personal was based on him.He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1961 when he was surprised by Eamonn AndrewsWinn died from a heart attack at the age of 64, while playing tennis at home in Brighton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Redgrave", "response": ["Redgrave joined the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman in July 1941, () but was discharged on medical grounds in November 1942.Redgrave provided his friend the actor and writer Godfrey Winn (also in the Navy at the time), with a memorable signal his ship made. The aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious was in collision with another carrier, HMS Formidable in poor weather visibility in the Atlantic, after the collision Illustrious signalled: \"If you touch me in that place again, I shall scream\".  Having spent most of 1942 in the Reserve he managed to direct Lifeline (Norman Armstrong) starring Frank Pettingell at the Duchess Theatre in July; and The Duke in Darkness (Patrick Hamilton) starring Leslie Banks at the St James's Theatre in October, also taking the role of Gribaud.The Great Stage Stars, Sheridan Morley, and Who's Who in the Theatre 1981"]}, {"page": "Anna Neagle", "response": ["In 1945 Neagle appeared on stage in Emma, a dramatisation of Jane Austen's novel. That same year she was seen in the film I Live in Grosvenor Square, co-starring Rex Harrison. She wanted Harrison for the lead in her next film, Piccadilly Incident (1946). However, he (as well as John Mills) proved to be unavailable at the time, so Wilcox cast Michael Wilding in the lead. Thus was born what film critic Godfrey Winn called \"the greatest team in British films\". The story \u2013 of a wife, presumed dead, returning to her (remarried) husband \u2013 bears a resemblance to the Irene Dunne\u2013Cary Grant comedy My Favorite Wife. Piccadilly Incident was chosen as Picturegoer's Best Film of 1947. Despite the fact that Neagle was some 8 years senior to Wilding, they proved to be an extremely bankable romantic pairing at the British box office. By now in her mid-40s, Neagle continued to have success in youthful and romantic lead roles."]}, {"page": "Juke Box Jury", "response": ["* 10 December 1960 \u2013 Larry Adler, Susan Stranks, Godfrey Winn and a 'surprise guest'", "* 14 July 1962 - Jack Jackson, Godfrey Winn, Katie Boyle and a 'surprise guest'"]}, {"page": "Googie Withers", "response": ["She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1971 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, whilst thinking she was going to be interviewed by her close friend Godfrey Winn.
