At the time, only two law schools were in the Boston area and the time-honored practice of reading law in the office of an established lawyer was losing its effectiveness. An advisory committee, consisting of James Barr Ames, dean of the Harvard Law School; Samuel Bennett, dean of the Boston University School of Law; and Massachusetts Judge James R. Dunbar, was formed to assist with the formation of the evening law program. The program was incorporated as an LL.B.-granting law school, the Evening School of Law of Boston YMCA, in 1904. Additional campuses of YMCA Law School were opened in Worcester, Massachusetts by 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts by 1919, and Providence, Rhode Island by 1921. The Worcester and Providence branches were closed by 1942, but the Springfield branch eventually became the Western New England University School of Law. In its early days, the school \"saw itself as the working man's alternative to the elite schools\" and \"boasted of being 'An Evening Law School with Day School Standards,'\" using the case method of teaching, according to legal historian Robert Stevens."]}, {"page": "Cyril Asquith, Baron Asquith of Bishopstone", "response": ["As to his impact, Robert Stevens thought that:\"perhaps because of his nature and his natural conservatism, he had virtually no impact in the Lords \u2026 It was an undistinguished period in the House of Lords as a final court of appeal; Asquith did nothing to ameliorate it.\"However, his judgments, which combined his knowledge of the law and his literary interests, were said by Stevens to possess a certain distinction."]}, {"page": "1933 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 8 June \u2013 Robert Stevens, English lawyer and academic (died 2021)"]}, {"page": "Robert B.

The sequel, In Search of Justice (1968), demonstrated the failings of the legal system as a social service.
