The band is composed of singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Richard Oakes, bass player Mat Osman, drummer Simon Gilbert and keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Neil Codling.", "In 1992, Suede were dubbed \"The Best New Band in Britain\" by Melody Maker, and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album Suede went to the top of the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster 'Britpop' as a musical movement, though the band distanced themselves from the term. The recording sessions for their second album, Dog Man Star, were fraught with difficulty and ended with original guitarist Bernard Butler departing after confrontations with the other members. The album was completed without Butler, and the band toured the record with replacement Richard Oakes. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has over time been lauded as one of rock music's great albums. In 1994, Suede would become a component of the Britpop \"big four\", along with Oasis, Blur and Pulp.", "Led by the single \"We Are the Pigs\", Suede's second album, Dog Man Star, finally appeared in October 1994. The album was very well received by critics in the UK who wrote favourably of the band's new experimental direction. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number three, but slid quickly down the charts.Harris, p. 187 The singles from the album charted poorly, though they are still regarded as Suede's best output, especially \"The Wild Ones\", which is considered by some to be Suede's best single. Reviews in the US were more mixed, with some critics comparing it unfavourably to the singles from the first album; and several labelling it as pretentious and other synonyms to that effect. Rolling Stone would describe it as \"one of the most pretentious albums ever released by a major label.\" Nevertheless, despite not gaining mass exposure at the time, it steadily garnered a legacy throughout the decade and beyond as one of rock music's great albums. In September 1994, Suede announced that 17-year-old Richard Oakes was to be the new guitarist. After reading about Butler's departure, he had sent a demo tape to the band's fanclub.Barnett, p. 161 When Gilbert heard Anderson playing back the tape whilst going through audition tapes, he mistakenly believed it to be an early Suede demo. Oakes' first official duty as a member of Suede was an appearance in the \"We Are the Pigs\" video. He then co-wrote his first music with Suede, the B-sides for the \"New Generation\" single, \"Together\" and \"Bentswood Boys\". Suede embarked on a long international tour during late 1994 and spring 1995, before disappearing to work on their third album. In 1995, the band contributed a track to The Help Album charity compilation, covering Elvis Costello's \"Shipbuilding\".", "By the time the compilation was released in 1997, the Britpop movement was noticeably waning in popularity, and the band had decided to split with their long-time producer Ed Buller before commencing work on the follow-up to Coming Up. Before focusing work on their next album, the band recorded a version of \"Poor Little Rich Girl\" for the Twentieth-Century Blues: The Songs of Noel Coward in 1998. Despite being backed by their second-highest-charting single, \"Electricity\", Suede's fourth album, Head Music, did not evoke the critical and listener enthusiasm that previous records did, though it once again took the band to number one on the UK Albums Chart. A synthesiser-infused album that focused less on guitar riffs and more on keyboards, it was produced by Steve Osborne, who had worked with Happy Mondays and New Order. While the record was heavily promoted with some strong financial backing, and received almost widespread critical enthusiasm from the UK music press, the consensus with people close to the band was a feeling that things were not quite right. Richard Oakes was aware of the fans' disapproval of the album, as well as Anderson's more gaunt-like appearance and Oakes' own admission of spending two years \"being pissed out [his] face and being out of shape.\"Barnett, p. 232  Moreover, many critics felt the record's lyrics were too shallow and lacking in substance. Though others praised the album, feeling that the band were again taking a different direction and charting new territory.", "*Richard Oakes \u2013 guitars (1994\u20132003, 2010\u2013present), backing vocals (2002-2003)", " bar:Richard text:\"Richard Oakes\""]}, {"page": "Poole", "response": ["Notable people born in Poole include the Suede guitarist Richard Oakes,"]}, {"page": "Fender Jaguar", "response": ["* Richard Oakes"]}, {"page": "Coming Up (album)", "response": ["Coming Up is the third album by English alternative rock band Suede, released on 2 September 1996 through Nude Records. It was the band's first album since the departure of guitarist Bernard Butler, who was replaced by Richard Oakes. Also added to the band was keyboardist Neil Codling. The album was nominated for the 1997 Mercury Prize. A commercial and critical success, Coming Up was the second by the band to reach no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, producing five top ten singles and receiving a favourable reception at home and in the US. Coming Up was the album that introduced Suede to a worldwide audience, in places such as Europe, Canada and Asia.", "After the departure of guitarist Bernard Butler and the lack of commercial success with Dog Man Star and its singles, Suede were being somewhat dismissed by the British music press with Oasis, Blur and Pulp taking the limelight. Determined to bring Suede back into the mainstream, frontman Brett Anderson decided that the sound of the new album would be the complete opposite of Dog Man Star. \"I think the next album will be quite simple, actually. I'd really like to write a straightforward pop album. Just ten hits.\"Barnett, p. 183 The guitarist to replace Butler was the 17-year-old Richard Oakes, who beat 500 other applicants for the role. Instead of applying for the job like everyone else, Oakes was auditioned on the strength of an impromptu demo tape he sent to the Suede fan club. Despite Oakes' smooth integration into his new role and the band's rejuvenated spirit, Anderson was tired of touring and was keen to get back in the studio with his new songwriting partner. He recalled: \"it was becoming really not much fun touring an album that wasn't made by the band.\"Barnett, p. 179 At the time Suede were fatigued with being on tour, which was reflected in the B-side, \"Have You Ever Been This Low\".", "*Richard Oakes \u2013 guitars"]}, {"page": "Dog Man Star", "response": ["Promotion for the album took place in a somewhat lukewarm atmosphere. With the departure of one half of the song-writing partnership, fans and the music press had assumed that the band were finished. Anderson and the remaining members were determined to continue on as normal and conducted press interviews to get the message across that the band were looking for a new guitarist; and that they were staying together, as Suede was the only thing they ever truly believed in. Promotion for the album started one month before its scheduled release with the band conducting interviews with the UK and American music press. The band recruited new guitarist Richard Oakes mid-September after hearing a tape of him playing \"My Insatiable One\" that he had sent to the band's fanclub. Lead single \"We Are the Pigs\" was released 12 September peaking at 18 in the UK. The choice of lead single had been a subject of debate, with Sony pressuring Anderson to release \"New Generation\" first for commercial reasons. He was unwavering on the matter, putting his artistic beliefs ahead of business sense as he felt \"We Are the Pigs\" had the \"drama and power\" that represented the album's message. He recalled: \"I'd mis-read people's perception of the song. I'd lost my perspective on reality.\" Bassist Mat Osman felt \"The Wild Ones\" should have been the first single, and said releasing \"We Are the Pigs\" was \"commercial suicide.\" The single was performed 22 September on Top of the Pops where Oakes made his first TV performance. The band played three dates in Paris early October, with Oakes making his live debut there before making his official UK debut at a secret fanclub show at Raw Club in London 10 October.", "In June 2011, Suede released remastered and expanded editions of their previous five studio albums. Released in chronological order each week. The expanded version includes the original 12 tracks remastered. Additional bonus material includes demos, all b-sides from the singles \"Stay Together\", \"We Are the Pigs\" and \"The Wild Ones\". Missing are the b-sides to \"New Generation\", which featured replacement guitarist Richard Oakes. Also included are six extra tracks; notable songs include the original unedited versions of \"The Wild Ones\" and \"The Asphalt World\", and \"La Puissance\", a version of \"The Power\" sung in French. The DVD features song-films which were specially created for the Dog Man Star tour and previously-unseen footage of the band playing at the Casino de Paris and at the Fnac, Les Halles in Paris on 27 November 1993. The bonus DVD material features a 2011 interview with Anderson and Butler including contemporary film inserts from Simon Gilbert. The booklet contains all the lyrics, hand-written lyric drafts and previously unpublished photos of the band. There is also a specially-written note by Anderson; in it he says: \"If I could choose to be remembered for just one musical document it would be this.\" The reissue is notable for having no content featuring Oakes. It was revealed by Suede's biographer David Barnett that Butler made an \"11th hour\" request that all traces of Oakes - B-sides, live footage and promotional videos for the singles be erased from the reissue.

Anderson felt that his spiralling drug use and Codling's illness made Oakes become more isolated from the group; and that the only people who were still getting on well were Osman and drummer Simon Gilbert.
