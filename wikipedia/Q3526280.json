During a 13-year career for Nottinghamshire and England he took 1,274 wickets at an average of 13.73.\nIn 1879/80 Morley toured North America with Richard Daft, and in 1880 he was selected to play in the match that later became known as the first Test match to take place in England, taking 8 for 146, including five wickets in the first innings. He toured Australia in 1882/3 as part of the Honourable Ivo Bligh's side that aimed to recover the Ashes. However, he was hampered by an injury to his rib that he picked up when the team's ship was involved in a collision in the harbour at Colombo. Official reports deemed the incident an \"unfortunate incidence of chance\". Rumours, however, soon surfaced regarding the supposed accidental nature of the collision, with some historians postulating malicious sabotage from rival cricket teams.  After sustaining injuries, his subsequent bowling performances were poor. He never recovered from his injuries. Alienated from his family members due to his deteriorating health and subsequent inability to bring in income, Morley lived in seclusion during the remainder of his life. He died of congestion and dropsy in September 1884 at the age of 33. He was interred with a cricket ball placed in his left (favoured) hand.He was married to Hannah, a seamstress, and they had at least three children, Sarah, Harold and Allen.

From then on, Attewell was always in the front rank of English bowlers, and after Shaw dropped out of the Nottinghamshire eleven in early 1887 he became the undisputed leader of the county's attack.

He proved deadly in a wet La Ni\u00f1a season in minor games, but had no opportunity of showing his deadliness on a sticky wicket at the highest level because Lohmann and Briggs were so effective.

An article written for The Argus, a Melbourne-based daily newspaper, by an unnamed member of the Australian side in 1882 reported that Crossland bowled; \"with a delivery so like a throw that I feel sure it would not be allowed in Australia; but, as we all know, throwing in England is just as common as bowling \u2013 more's the pity\", and it was speculated that the Australian team would have protested had Crossland been chosen for the Test match.."]}, {"page": "William Mycroft", "response": ["Mycroft's form was to last into the 1876 season, when he was top bowler with 62 wickets and achieved best bowling of 9\u201325, a record which lasted nearly fifty years before being bettered by Billy Bestwick.
