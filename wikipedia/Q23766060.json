Three years later, he instead became an organiser for the British Steel Smelters' Association (BSSA).  In 1917, this became part of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (ISTC), and he was appointed as a divisional officer.Brown was also active in the Labour Party, and was elected to Manchester City Council.  In 1935, with the ISTC's general secretary Arthur Pugh about to retire, Brown was appointed as his assistant for six months and moved to Glasgow, where he was elected to Glasgow City Council.Pugh retired at the end of 1935, and Brown was chosen as his replacement.
