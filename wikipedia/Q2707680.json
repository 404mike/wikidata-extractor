The majority are due to defects of single genes that code for enzymes that facilitate conversion of various substances (substrates) into others (products). In most of the disorders, problems arise due to accumulation of substances which are toxic or interfere with normal function, or due to the effects of reduced ability to synthesize essential compounds. Inborn errors of metabolism are now often referred to as congenital metabolic diseases or inherited metabolic disorders. To this concept it's possible to include the new term of Enzymopathy. This term was created following the study of Biodynamic Enzymology, a science based on the study of the enzymes and their derivated products. Finally, inborn errors of metabolism were studied for the first time by British physician Archibald Garrod (1857\u20131936), in 1908. He is known for work that prefigured the \"one gene-one enzyme\" hypothesis, based on his studies on the nature and inheritance of alkaptonuria. His seminal text, Inborn Errors of Metabolism, was published in 1923."]}, {"page": "List of geneticists", "response": ["*Archibald Garrod (1857\u20131936), English physician, pioneered inborn errors, founded biochemical genetics"]}, {"page": "History of genetics", "response": ["* 1902: Archibald Garrod discovered inborn errors of metabolism.

Another of the exceptions was the work of Boris Ephrussi and George Beadle, two geneticists working on the eye color pigments of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies in the Caltech laboratory of Thomas Hunt Morgan.  In the mid-1930s they found that genes affecting eye color appeared to be serially dependent, and that the normal red eyes of Drosophila were the result of pigments that went through a series of transformations; different eye color gene mutations disrupted the transformations at a different points in the series.  Thus, Beadle reasoned that each gene was responsible for an enzyme acting in the metabolic pathway of pigment synthesis.  However, because it was a relatively superficial pathway rather than one shared widely by diverse organisms, little was known about the biochemical details of fruit fly eye pigment metabolism.  Studying that pathway in more detail required isolating pigments from the eyes of flies, an extremely tedious process.Morange, pp. 21-24"]}, {"page": "History of medical diagnosis", "response": ["The successor to William Osler as Regius Professor at Oxford was Archibald Garrod. Garrod echoed the observations of his Greek counterparts of two millennia ago, ...our chemical individualities are due to our chemical merits as well as our chemical shortcomings; and it is more nearly true to say that the factors which confer upon us our predispositions to and immunities from various mishaps which are spoken of as diseases, are inherent in our very chemical structure; and even in the molecular groupings which confer upon us our individualities, and which went into the making of the chromosomes from which we sprang. Because Garrod practiced in the early 1900s, well before the knowledge of DNA encoding genes that in turn encoded proteins responsible for bodily structure and functions were discovered, it took some time before medicine could fully appreciate the fundamental importance of his concept of diagnosis."]}, {"page": "Garrod's tetrad", "response": ["In medicine, Garrod's tetrad is a term named for British physician Archibald Garrod, who introduced the phrase \"inborn errors of metabolism\" in a lecture in 1908.Archibald E.

H.A. Bird described them as an incidental finding in a professional violinist and proposed that they arise in such cases due to repeated extreme tension of the extensor tendons over the interphalangeal joints. Bird noted that violin players use the left hand for a markedly different task than the right hand, with the extensor tendons in the left hand subjected to considerable tension, and that Garrod's pads only arise on the left hand in such cases. This unilateral finding differentiates the occupational hazard of Garrod's pads from more significant disorders. Among violinists and violists, Garrod's pads apparently arise as a protective mechanism for the skin and subcutaneous tissues above the tendons; Bird notes that they do not protect against external trauma unlike most calluses."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Christ Church, Oxford", "response": ["* Sir Archibald Garrod (1857\u20131936), physician and pioneer molecular geneticist"]}, {"page": "Harry Harris (geneticist)", "response": ["* Archibald Garrod and Harry Harris.
