His most notable contribution was in developing flying instruction methods.  In December 1916 he masterminded a complete reorganisation of flying training methods at Gosport. This new training method later became known as the \"Gosport System\" and was adopted worldwide.The curriculum combined classroom training and dual flight instruction. Students were not led away from potentially dangerous manoeuvres but deliberately exposed to them in controlled environments so they could learn to recover from errors of judgement. Choice of training aircraft used later settled on the Avro 504J.Smith-Barry was later described by Lord Trenchard as the man who \"taught the air forces of the world how to fly\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Flying Corps", "response": ["Colonel Robert Smith-Barry, a former CO of 60 Squadron, appalled at the poor standard of newly trained pilots and high fatality rate during training in 1915\u201316, formulated a comprehensive curriculum for pilot training, and with the agreement of Trenchard, returned to the UK to implement his training ethos at Gosport in 1917. The immediate effect was to halve fatalities in training.", "* Robert Smith-Barry, systematised the training of pilots and set up a formal curriculum of flying training (the \"Gosport System\") that was subsequently taken up worldwide"]}, {"page": "Mexican Air Force", "response": ["When WWI Ace U.S. Colonel Ralph O'Neill was hired to head the restructuring of the Mexican Air Force in 1920, he reported to General Plutarco El\u00edas Calles that most of the aircraft available had to be replaced. Until August 1920, the entire fleet consisted of 13 national made prototypes of mixed engine design. These were functional yet ill-equipped for battle, 4 being scout monoplanes. 5 others were in repair and over 20 more at the TNCA were obsolete or wrecked beyond repair. The branch initially consisted of 27 pilots, 17 of which were cadets. In anticipation of the new \"Chief\", a purchase was made of 13 French Farman F.50 night bombers. Commander O'Neill soon acquired 35 British made Avro 504K and Avro 504J airplanes, which later would be made in Mexico under the name Avro An\u00e1huac. O'Neill was the first to introduce the term \"Fuerza A\u00e9rea Mexicana\" (FAM) naming the organization as such. The next step was the formation of classified fighter, bombing, observation and reconnaissance squadrons, as well as the decentralization of Air Force units throughout the country at strategic bases. O'Neill then set to work with his co-instructors German Fritz Bieler and Frenchman Joe Ben Lievre, using the first intercom known as the \"Gosport System\", invented by Robert Smith-Barry, in order to give in-air commands.
