Brian Flynn's \"Swans\" avoided relegation out of the English Football League by just a single point, though Richards managed a respectable tally of seven goals in 17 games. He got his first league goal at Vetch Field on 30 November, again with a header, to wrap up a 2\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town. On 15 February, he scored twice against Cambridge United, and also had a goal disallowed for offside. He received his first sending off a week later, after reacting badly to a foul by Hartlepool United captain Michael Barron. After discovering he was released from his contract at Blackburn in April 2003, Richards aimed to sign with Swansea permanently, but instead signed a two-year deal with Northampton Town."]}]}}
