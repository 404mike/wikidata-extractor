He also experimented with bagpipes on the track \"Police Patrol\" from the 1982 album Quo Vardis, worked with Jools Holland (Squeeze), Andy Bown (Status Quo & Pink Floyd), Ron Asprey, Terry Horbury (Dirty Tricks) and Judd Lander. Steve is thought to have taken his last name from either Sylvia and Gerry Anderson's astronaut in 1960s television show Fireball XL5, or his Selmer Zodiac 100-watt amplifier, which had to be used at full volume to get the distortion and sustain which was fundamental to his sound.\nZodiac's work contributed greatly to modern heavy metal and inspired many heavy metal bands of today. He is directly quoted by giants like Metallica as a heavy influence. He prematurely quit Vardis in the mid-1980s (which resulted in outcry amongst rock 'n' roll fans across Britain), due to mounting tensions between himself and several people within the music industry.\nOriginal Vardis records are rare and are valued in most record collector's books and guides. An original copy of 100 MPH including the enclosed tour guide and poster has an estimated value of approximately \u00a3500 ($940).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vardis", "response": ["They formed a prominent part of the new wave of British heavy metal scene, then prevalent in the United Kingdom.

Alan Selway was later replaced by Terry Horbury (previously of Dirty Tricks) on bass guitar.", "Vardis quickly gained notoriety for their high energy live performances, the unique approach of incorporating elements of 1970s glam rock and heavy metal music and frontman Steve Zodiac's searing Fender Telecaster sound. Zodiac was reputable for playing Vardis concerts barefoot and bare chested, his look completed by long, naturally ice-blonde hair.", "Their second album, released in April 1981 and called The World's Insane, featured a cover version of Hawkwind's \"Silver Machine\", and featured bagpipes played by Judd Lander, making it one of the few heavy metal albums of that time to ever feature bagpipes. The album also featured a guest appearances from Status Quo's Andy Bown on keyboards. In 1982, Steve Zodiac was voted in the top 15 rock guitarists by Sounds magazine readers."]}, {"page": "Zodiac, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve Zodiac"]}]}}
