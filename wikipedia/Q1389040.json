Al-Jazzar commanded his troops in Acre and personally scaled the town's walls and engaged in direct fighting with French soldiers. Prior to Bonaparte's arrival at Acre, al-Jazzar's forces had been bolstered by an advance brigade of 700 troops dispatched by the Sublime Porte.Aksan, 2014 p. 230. With access to the sea largely unfettered, he was able to secure supplies and reinforcements. Among the key reinforcements were some 800 British marines, who were led by Sidney Smith. The British Navy,Masters, p. 132. specifically two men-of-war ships,Finkel, 2007, p. 411. also came to al-Jazzar's aid and bombarded Bonaparte's trenches through the course of the siege, resulting in heavy French casualties prior to the arrival of artillery batteries that the French used to shell Acre's fortress.

Following the French occupation and withdrawal from Palestine in 1799, local Muslim anger was directed at local Christians, with the Catholics of Ramla in particular being killed, plundered and forced to flee.Haas 1934, p. 301. Al-Jazzar did not make an effort to end these attacks and instead took advantage of popular anger to order attacks against the Christians of Nazareth and Jerusalem.
