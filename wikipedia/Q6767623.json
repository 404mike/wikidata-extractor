Gemma gives Belle a makeover after Sean laughs at her, which impresses Thomas. Belle's parents find inappropriate pictures of her on her phone, with evidence that Thomas took them. Sean steals a bottle of alcohol in an attempt to impress her, but he sees her with Thomas and smashes it. Belle's relationship with Thomas causes her to neglect Gemma. After a fight, Gemma sends Sean a suggestive photo of Belle which she had taken earlier in an attempt to get Thomas to notice her. However, Sean defends Belle and asks her if Thomas is making her do stuff, leading to her to angrily announce she never fancied him. In response, he posts the picture online. Thomas attacks Sean in defence of Belle. Sean apologises and she forgives him. Belle finds Thomas about to run away in Dan Spencer's (Liam Fox) van, and she begs him to take her with him. Paddy believes that Thomas has kidnapped Belle, and tells her family. Thomas later brings her back to the village."]}, {"page": "Mark Flanagan", "response": ["Mark Flanagan may refer to:", "* Mark Flanagan (actor), Welsh television actor", "* Mark Flanagan (boxer) (born 1990), Australian boxer", "* Mark Flanagan (chef), head chef to the royal household of the UK", "* Mark Flanagan (communications), former head of strategic communications at 10 Downing Street, now a partner at Portland Communications", "* Mark Flanagan (musician), British blues guitarist", "* Mark Flanagan (rugby league) (born 1987), English rugby league player", "* Mark Flanagan (rugby union) (born 1989), Irish rugby union player", "* Mark Flanagan, owner of the Largo nightclub in Los Angeles"]}, {"page": "List of Pobol y Cwm characters", "response": ["| Huw \"Jinx\" Jenkins || Mark Flanagan || 2005\u20132015, 2021\u2013 || Formerly DJ at Cwm FM.
