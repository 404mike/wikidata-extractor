The term was first coined by Birmingham's now defunct label \"Beyond Records\" in early 1990s.

Ambient dub adopts dub styles made famous by King Tubby and other Jamaican sound artists from the 1960s to the early 1970s, using DJ-inspired ambient electronica, complete with all the inherent drop-outs, echo, equalization and psychedelic electronic effects. It often features layering techniques and incorporates elements of world music, deep bass lines and harmonic sounds. According to David Toop, \"Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation.\" Notable artists within the genre include Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, The Orb, Gaudi, Ott, Loop Guru, Woob and Transglobal Underground as well as Banco de Gaia."]}, {"page": "List of ambient music artists", "response": ["* Woob"]}, {"page": "Journeyman (disambiguation)", "response": ["* \"Journeyman\", recording name of Paul Frankland (a.k.a.

In addition, various other tracks were compiled onto the anthologies em:t beat exploration and em:t explorer.", "All of the albums on the original run of em:t releases fit into the general category of Ambient music, or downtempo. Within this category there were many variations - Woob's releases were often ambient dub, Gas' music was ambient techno, Carl Stone's album was almost classical and the album by International People's Gang was almost pop. However, across all the releases there were certain recurring elements that identified the album as an em:t release. Most prominent were samples of animal noises recorded in the wild - heard on releases by Woob, Qubism, Beatsystem, Miasma, and others (this approach was taken to the extreme on the track \"Waterpump\" by Dallas Simpson, on the 1197 compilation, which is a 12-minute music-free recording of a self actuated water pressure pump in a Derbyshire countryside filled with birdsong and, as with both of Simpson's tracks featured in the series, \"abha\" 2296, \"waterpump\" 1197, were recorded in full binaural stereo for full periphonic headphone surround sound listening). Other tracks processed field recordings and used them as percussion, such as \"Pool\" by International People's Gang, which uses the clacking of pool balls as instrumentation, and \"00\" by Richie Warburton, which uses the back-and-forth of a tennis match for the same purpose. Samples of television series such as Quantum Leap, Steptoe and Son and Star Trek were also used, as well as samples from films, such as Sex, Lies, and Videotape and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and film soundtracks.", "The em:t series of albums are still prized among electronic music fans, and the reputation of the label and the music endures to this day.

In 2017, Bandcamp has made all Em:t releases available for both purchase and streaming except for Woob 1194 and Woob2 4495.

It also contains the shortest Woob track to date, the 33-second long \"Cupboard\", which is made up of elements of \"Depart\".
