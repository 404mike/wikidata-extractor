He is most notable for playing Billy Corkhill in the soap opera Brookside, with many other smaller appearances in other soaps and dramas. Playing a regular character in Brookside's heyday (alongside Ricky Tomlinson and Sue Johnston, and working with writers such as Jimmy McGovern), he burned himself into the viewers' memories with his portrayal of a man beyond breaking point, which culminated with him ranting at neighbours and churning up their lawns, as he drove his car around in circles.\nJohn was the subject of This Is Your Life in 2003 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel on the set of Merseybeat.In 2006, he portrayed Frank Taylor in the BBC's Surviving Disasters, about the Munich air disaster of 1958, in which Taylor was the only newspaper reporter to survive.In 2010, he played Christopher Mead's father in Waterloo Road.\nMcArdle is also an accomplished stage actor, recently seen in Our Country's Good at the Liverpool Playhouse.\nHe is a patron of the Octagon Theatre in Bolton and Chief Officer of Age Uk Wigan.\nFrom 2016 to 2017, McArdle appeared in the  ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, as regular character, Ronnie Hale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prime Suspect", "response": ["* John McArdle as Detective Chief Superintendent Ballinger (series 5)"]}, {"page": "Brookside (TV series)", "response": ["1985 was a pivotal year for Brookside.

The First 10 Years. The Authorised History. Boxtree. Page 98 At this point, the show was only in its third year and number 7 Brookside Close was then home to young nurses Sandra Maghie (Sheila Grier) and Kate Moses (Sharon Rosita), and former hospital porter Pat Hancock (David Easter). They rented the property from Harry and Edna Cross, who had moved into the bungalow next door after Harry suffered a serious angina attack. Through their nursing, they encountered John Clarke (Robert Pugh), whose elderly mother eventually died of natural causes in hospital, while under their care. Gradually, John's instability grew into insanity as he was unable to cope with the death of his mother, and he forced his way into number 7 armed with a gun and ready to avenge his mother's death. He held the three hostage for several days in a tense three-episode run with Brookside Close sealed off and surrounded by armed police. The siege culminated in three shots resulting in the death of Kate followed by John's suicide. Some critics took issue with the unlikely plot-premise; for example, Hilary Kingsley described it as \"ludicrous\" in her book Soap Box, while others were critical of the producers' decision to kill off Kate, the series' only black character.Kingsley, p. 47 Viewers disagreed and ratings were pushed to over 8 million for the first time.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White.

The first generation to appear in the Close were Billy (John McArdle) and Doreen (Kate Fitzgerald), who moved into number 10 with their children Rod (Jason Hope) and Tracy (Justine Kerrigan). Stories involving the Corkhills were strongly concerned with marital problems and debt. With Billy languishing on the dole, Doreen struggled to raise money to support her desperate family. Doreen's interfering mother, Julia Brogan (Gladys Ambrose), followed the family and became a hugely popular comedy character, often dropping in to see her daughter at the most inappropriate moments.

Barry had nearly been caught committing crimes and his deals with Tommy brought his family \"pain and despair\".Redmond 1987, p.102. After five years on-screen, writers began to humanise Barry more. Redmond described a more \"thoughtful and conscience\" Barry, who had \"mellowed with age\". The change did not last as Barry became a source of evil in storylines. Originally depicted as Sheila's protector and a \"Jack the lad\" type character, with money making scams alongside his best friend Terry Sullivan (Brian Regan).Tibballs 1992, p.46. Barry viewed himself as a \"hard case\" always willing to defend his family using violence. Stories which involved Barry with serious gangsters such as Tommy and Sizzler (Renny Krupinski) transformed the character into a sinister one. Usher was delighted with the changes and thought it made the character more complex. He told Geoff Tibballs, author of Brookside - The First Ten Years, that \"I'm glad we're seeing the nasty side of Barry Grant, I wanted to make him more evil. He's a more interesting character than just a Mammy's boy.\" Writers had made him a \"man of power\" and to facilitate this they made him a property owner, purchasing the shops on Brookside Parade. The power Barry gains corrupts him and with stories involving shot gun toting threats and murder, they showed he was unpleasant and nasty. Barry became self-serving and bitter towards Sheila for moving in with Billy Corkhill (John McArdle). Another showing of his newfound wealth was having a celebrity opening of his restaurant.
