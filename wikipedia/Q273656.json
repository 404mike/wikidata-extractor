For five years, from 1928, he worked with Delius, taking down his new compositions from dictation, and helping him revise earlier works. Together they produced Cynara (a setting of words by Ernest Dowson), A Late Lark (a setting of W. E. Henley), A Song of Summer, a third violin sonata, the Irmelin prelude, and Idyll (1932), which reused music from Delius's short opera Margot la rouge, composed thirty years earlier. McVeagh rates their greatest joint production as The Songs of Farewell, settings of Whitman poems for chorus and orchestra, which were dedicated to Jelka. Other works produced in this period include a Caprice and Elegy for cello and orchestra written for the distinguished British cellist Beatrice Harrison, and a short orchestral piece, Fantastic Dance, which Delius dedicated to Fenby. The violin sonata incorporates the first, incomprehensible, melody that Delius had attempted to dictate to Fenby before their modus operandi had been worked out. Fenby's initial failure to pick up the tune led Delius to the view that \"[the] boy is no good\u00a0... he cannot even take down a simple melody\".Fenby (1981), pp. 31\u201333 Fenby later wrote a book about his experiences of working with Delius. Among other details, Fenby reveals Delius's love of cricket.

The first electrical complete recording (using a single carbon microphone) was made in 1928, by Harrison, Elgar and the London Symphony Orchestra. A notable later recording was made by Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 in 1965 with Sir John Barbirolli and the London Symphony Orchestra for EMI. During a break in the recording session, the 20-year-old du Pr\u00e9 left the studio, returning to find a large audience of local musicians and critics who had heard that a star was in the making. On hearing her recording, Mstislav Rostropovich is said to have removed the work from his own repertoire. In an interview, on being asked why the Elgar concerto was not in his standard repertoire, Rostropovich said \"My pupil, Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9, played it much better than I.\" Du Pr\u00e9's recording has been praised for its passion as well as a secure technique.See, e.g., . Barbirolli himself had an association with the concerto from its first days: he was a member of the cello section of the orchestra at its 1919 premiere; and he was the soloist at one of its earliest performances, with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra under Sir Dan Godfrey.Some sources state that Barbirolli gave the second performance of the concerto, but the original soloist, Felix Salmond, gave the work its second performance, with the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester on 20 March 1920, and Beatrice Harrison also played the solo part before Barbirolli did: see . Reviewing Barbirolli's 1921 performance, The Musical Times commented, \"Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure.\" See The Musical Times, 1 March 1921, p. 195", "The BBC Radio 3 feature \"Building a Library\" has presented comparative reviews of all available versions of the concerto on three occasions.

The duet inspired Rothenberg's 2005 book Why Birds Sing. Rothenberg has also recorded a duet with an Australian lyrebird. In Why Birds Sing, Rothenberg claims that birds vocalize traditional scales used in human music. He argues that birds like the hermit thrush sing on the pentatonic scale, while the wood thrush sings on the diatonic scale, as evidence that birdsong not only sounds like music, but is music in a human sense. Rothenberg's ideas were explored in a 2006 BBC documentary with the same title as the book. The claim that birds use fixed musical intervals, as on a scale, is however contradicted by a 2012 study led by the ecologist Marcelo Araya-Salas.
