Lt.-Col. Best-Dunkley dashed forward, rallied his leading waves, and personally led them to the assault of these positions, which, despite heavy losses, were carried. He continued to lead his battalion until all their objectives had been gained. Had it not been for this officer's gallant and determined action it is doubtful if the left of the brigade would have reached its objectives. Later in the day, when our position was threatened, he collected his battalion headquarters, led them to the attack, and beat off the advancing enemy. This gallant officer has since died of wounds.\nBefore enlisting, Best-Dunkley was a teacher at Tienstin Grammar School. There is a marble memorial plaque to him in the entrance hall of the School which was partially defaced by Japanese troops during their occupation of China.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| Bertram Best-Dunkley || British Army || 1917 || First World War || Wieltje"]}, {"page": "Lancashire Fusiliers", "response": ["* Captain (Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel) Bertram Best-Dunkley, Great War"]}]}}
