He made a cameo in AIP's Bikini Beach (1964) and had a bigger role in that studio's The Comedy of Terrors (1964), directed by Jacques Tourneur, and travelled to England to make Die, Monster, Die! (1965).  British actress Suzan Farmer, who played his daughter in the film, later recalled Karloff was aloof during production \"and wasn\u2019t the charming personality people perceived him to be\", probably because he was in such intense pain in the 1960s."]}, {"page": "1942 in television", "response": ["*June 16 \u2013 Suzan Farmer, actress (died 2017)"]}, {"page": "Livilla", "response": ["Livilla has been depicted in three television series about the period.

Smith claims that, of the scenes that are derived from Lovecraft's work, the \"blasted heath doesn't live up to Lovecraft's description\"Smith, p. 45 and asserts that, overall, the film does not capture Lovecraft's intent to \"...play...with the idea of an alien life form completely different from anything humans can imagine\".Smith, p. 47 Smith considers Haller's work an imitation of Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe films, rather than a serious attempt to adapt Lovecraft's tale. Another adaptation, The Curse (1987), was directed by David Keith and stars Wil Wheaton, Claude Akins, Cooper Huckabee, and John Schneider. It more closely follows the plot of Lovecraft's work, albeit set in the 1980s. Lovecraft scholar Charles P.

The affair with Kristel ended his marriage to his second wife, model Ruth Post, with whom he had two children, Kate and Morgan. Through his daughter Kate, McShane has three grandchildren.

Shelley considered the later scene in that film in which her character is staked to be among her best work. In Village of the Damned \u2013 based on John Wyndham's science fiction novel, The Midwich Cuckoos \u2013 she gave a \"heartbreaking\" performance as one of the mothers of the alien children. In Quatermass and the Pit, she plays a scientist who is taken over by an alien spacecraft, in a scene described by Gilbey as \"painfully believable\".
