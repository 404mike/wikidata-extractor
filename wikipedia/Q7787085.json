Nine species were listed for the genus, four of which were nomina nuda at the time of publication, but no formal description was given for it. The genus was later briefly characterized by Frederick William Hope in 1840, under the new name \"Corynodes\". In 1865, Thomas Ansell Marshall published a monograph on Corynodes, dividing it into seven subgenera: Platycorynus, Corynodes, Theumorus, Eurycorynus, Omodon, Erigenes, and Bathycolpus. The latter five were originally intended to be new genera. In the same year, Hamlet Clark created a new genus, Corynoeides, for one of the species placed in Corynodes. However, Joseph Sugar Baly did not accept Clark's genus nor Marshall's subdivisions. In 1956, Monr\u00f3s & Bechyn\u00e9 pointed out that Platycorynus Chevrolat in Dejean, 1836 was available and had priority over Corynodes Hope, 1840, and that therefore the former should be used as the valid name for the genus."]}, {"page": "Pseudocolaspis azurea", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Ansell Marshall"]}, {"page": "Cyno (beetle)", "response": ["Cyno is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae.
