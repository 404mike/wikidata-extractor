Another legendary Richard was Maurice Evans, who first played the role at the Old Vic in 1934 and then created a sensation in his 1937 Broadway performance, revived it in New York in 1940 and then immortalised it on television for the Hallmark Hall of Fame in 1954. In England, Paul Scofield, who played it at the Old Vic in 1952, was considered the definitive Richard of more modern times. In the 1968\u20131970 seasons of the Prospect Theatre Company, Ian McKellen made a breakthrough performance as Richard, opposite Timothy West as Bolingbroke. The production, directed by Richard Cottrell, toured Britain and Europe, featuring in the Edinburgh Festival in 1969 and on BBC TV in 1970. In 1974, Ian Richardson and Richard Pasco alternated the roles of Richard and Bolingbroke in a production from John Barton at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre: thirty years later this was still a standard by which performances were being judged. One of the most accessible versions was the 1978 television production by the BBC of the play, shown as part of \"The Shakespeare Plays\" (a several years-long project to put all of Shakespeare's plays on tape). This version, still available on DVD, starred Derek Jacobi as Richard, with John Gielgud making an appearance as John of Gaunt. In 1997, Fiona Shaw played the role as a man. More recently, the play was staged by Trevor Nunn in modern costume at the Old Vic in 2005, with Kevin Spacey in the title role, and by Michael Grandage at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011\u201312 with Eddie Redmayne in the title role."]}, {"page": "Murder in the Cathedral", "response": ["* 1976 Richard Pasco of The Royal Shakespeare Company by Argo Records"]}, {"page": "Room at the Top (1959 film)", "response": ["* Richard Pasco as Teddy"]}, {"page": "Mrs Brown", "response": ["* Richard Pasco as Dr. Jenner"]}, {"page": "Royal Shakespeare Company", "response": ["* Richard II, directed by John Barton, starring Ian Richardson and Richard Pasco, alternating the roles of Richard and Bolingbroke (1973\u201374)"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| Mrs. Brown || Miramax Films || John Madden (director); Jeremy Brock (screenplay); Judi Dench, Billy Connolly, Geoffrey Palmer, Antony Sher, Gerard Butler, David Westhead, Richard Pasco, Bridget McConnell, Georgie Glen, Catherine O'Donnell || Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "1981 in film", "response": ["| The Watcher in the Woods || Walt Disney Productions / Buena Vista Distribution || John Hough (director); Brian Clemens, Harry Spalding, Rosemary Anne Sisson (screenplay); Bette Davis, Carroll Baker, David McCallum, Lynn-Holly Johnson, Kyle Richards, Ian Bannen, Richard Pasco, Frances Cuka, Benedict Taylor, Eleanor Summerfield, Georgina Hale, Katharine Levy || Horror || Live action"]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Watcher in the Woods || Walt Disney Productions / Buena Vista Distribution || John Hough (director); Brian Clemens, Harry Spalding, Rosemary Anne Sisson (screenplay); Bette Davis, Carroll Baker, David McCallum, Lynn-Holly Johnson, Kyle Richards, Ian Bannen, Richard Pasco, Frances Cuka, Benedict Taylor, Eleanor Summerfield, Georgina Hale, Katharine Levy || Horror || Live action"]}, {"page": "The Pilgrim's Progress", "response": ["The radio version was newly recorded by Hyperion Records in 1990, in a performance conducted by Matthew Best.

He has still been played by several actors in post-war performances. At the 1947 Avignon Festival, Pierre Lautrec played to Jean Vilar's Richard; Vilar also directed the play.
