Three days later, The Seagulls beat defending champions Liverpool 1\u20130 at Anfield for the first time in their history and the first league win at Liverpool since 1982 with Steven Alzate scoring his first ever Premier League goal.

On 20 April, Brighton drew away against Chelsea finishing 0\u20130, with the Sussex side claiming their first ever point at Stamford Bridge. On the same night Chelsea pulled out of the proposed plans of the European Super League with Potter saying about the competition, \"We feel it stands against everything we know as football.\" Praising the protesting Chelsea fans prior to kick off, \"Credit to the fans for making their case, and the quicker we get back to playing for points the better. We were a little bit delayed but the supporters are the most important thing.\" Two days later, while attending a press conference Potter appeared to have suffered a facial injury with a cut just below his left eye. \"I would love to be able to tell you that there's a heroic, chivalrous story here, that I can make myself look really good, but unfortunately I just missed my footing walking home on some steps and then went crashing into a metal railing\", joking that his modelling days were already long gone.

Brighton lost 2\u20130 away at Arsenal in the next game, the last game of the season. Potter's second year in charge of The Albion finished with a record equalling points tally of 41 points, which they also achieved the season before, however, they finished in 16th, a place below the previous season.

He was able to produce a strong performance on the final day of the season, when Birmingham avoided relegation on goal difference. He was chosen as the club's young player of the season, and felt that his increasing maturity was allowing him to take on more responsibility.

In the next match, Bartley scored his first goal in senior English football, an extra-time winner against Plymouth Argyle in the League Cup.
