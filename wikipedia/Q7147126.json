McCarthy went backstage and offered his services as a professional singer who was experienced with the piece. Given that the understudy for the part \u2013 a member of the choir \u2013 was, in fact, a doctor and therefore looking after Allen, his offer was accepted and McCarthy went onstage to complete the performance. He received a standing ovation.\nIn 1980, McCarthy re-located from London to Colchester. His voice had changed and he became a tenor singer, before moving to orchestral and choral conducting in 1992.\nIn that year he founded the Colchester Bach Choir and Orchestra, and he has also conducted the Ipswich Bach Choir and Chamber Orchestra, the Colchester Bach Choir and Orchestra and the Colchester Philharmonic, and for many years has been the Musical Director of The Witham Choral Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1974 in music", "response": ["**During a performance of Carmina Burana, conducted by Andr\u00e9 Previn, at The Proms, soloist Thomas Allen collapses because of the heat and eventually has to be carried out by members of the orchestra.
