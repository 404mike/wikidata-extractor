He was a member of British Cycling's Olympic Podium Programme, and represented Great Britain at a number of major events.

Regular teammates in the team sprint over the years have included Craig MacLean, Ross Edgar, Jamie Staff, Jason Queally, Matthew Crampton and Jason Kenny.", "He made his return to racing in the UK at the Revolution\u00a022 event in Manchester in December. He received a standing ovation from the Manchester faithful at the start of the event when he was introduced to the crowd. At this event Hoy won both the Sprint and Keirin competitions, defeating likes of Jason Kenny, Jamie Staff, Ross Edgar, Matthew Crampton and Teun Mulder along the way. Hoy competed in the World Cup Classics series' final event in Copenhagen, Denmark in February, helping his team to a gold medal in the team sprint event. However, he crashed out during the men's Keirin final and was forced to miss the final day of competition, including the men's sprint. Although at first, his injury seemed minor, he returned to Manchester where, following a scan, he was diagnosed with a serious de-gloving injury which finished his season and kept him off his bike for almost 3 months. He was unable to compete as planned at the Revolution 24 event in Manchester the following weekend, he did however make an appearance at the event. He had to pull out of the World Championships in Poland at the end of March, where he would have attempted to defend 2 World titles, because of the hip injury.", "Hoy started the 09/10 track season at the National Cycling Centre, Manchester, at the British National Championships where he took only his second (and third) ever individual national titles. He took gold medals in the Keirin, Sprint and was part of the Team Sprint Team representing team SKY along with Jamie Staff and Jason Kenny. Two weeks later, he raced in round one of the UCI World Cup at the same venue and took gold in the Men's Keirin. He then went into day 2 of the competition and took gold in the sprint event, beating fellow Brit Matthew Crampton in the final 2\u20130. A third World Cup gold came in the Team Sprint on the Sunday. Having ridden and won 12 events over the weekend, he withdrew from the International Japanese Keirin which was consequently won by Crampton."]}, {"page": "England at the 2006 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|Matthew Crampton", "|align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\"|Jason QueallyJamie StaffMatthew Crampton"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics", "response": ["| Team\u00a0sprint ||  Ross Edgar Chris Hoy Craig MacLean ||  Theo Bos Teun Mulder Tim Veldt ||  Matthew Crampton Jason Queally Jamie Staff", "| Team\u00a0sprint ||  Matthew Crampton Jason Kenny Craig MacLean ||  Theo Bos Teun Mulder Tim Veldt ||  Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9 Micka\u00ebl Bourgain K\u00e9vin Sireau", "| Team\u00a0sprint ||  Chris Hoy  Jamie Staff  Matthew Crampton ||  Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9  Fran\u00e7ois Pervis  K\u00e9vin Sireau ||  Ross Edgar  Jason Kenny  Jason Queally "]}, {"page": "UCI Track Cycling World Championships \u2013 Men's team sprint", "response": ["|Matthew Crampton Jamie Staff  Jason Kenny", "| Chris HoyMatthew CramptonJason Kenny"]}, {"page": "List of professional sports families", "response": ["| Matthew Crampton, Jessica Crampton"]}, {"page": "Jason Kenny", "response": ["In the season following the 2008 Games, Kenny scored three gold medals in the 2008\u201309 Track Cycling World Cup Classics, and took a silver in the team sprint at the 2009 UCI Track Cycling World Championships alongside Jamie Staff and Matthew Crampton, losing out to France.
