It highlights the struggles and conflicts between politicians, party spin doctors, advisers, civil servants and the media. In similar fashion to Yes Minister, the political parties involved are never mentioned by name, and in series 1 and 2 most policies discussed are fairly generic and non-ideological.  Beginning with the Christmas specials in which shadow DOSAC secretary Peter Mannion and his team are introduced, although still not named, the context makes clear that the government party is Labour and Mannion's party is the Conservatives.  This continues through series 3 and series 4 when the real life government coalition between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems is reflected in the show. Iannucci describes it as \"Yes Minister meets Larry Sanders\". Journalist and former civil servant Martin Sixsmith was an adviser to the writing team, adding to the realism of some scenes. The series became well known for its profanity and for featuring storylines which have mirrored, or in some cases predicted, real-life policies, events or scandals.Roger Drew, \"A whole new power struggle: Plot twists and profanity behind new series of The Thick of It\", The Independent, 1 September 2012The Thick of It: top 10 Malcolm Tucker moments\", The Guardian, 15 October 2009Stewart Heritage, Have you been watching...The Thick of It?, The Guardian, 17 October 2012John Plunkett, The Thick of It: 'it feels more like politicians copy us', The Guardian, 22 August 2012", "The series was written by a team of writers led by Armando Iannucci, who also directed the series, with Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Roger Drew, Sean Gray, Ian Martin, Will Smith and Tony Roche.Cast list at the Internet Movie Database.
