The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.\nTrotobas's first mission to France in September 1941 ended with him being arrested by Vichy police and imprisoned for several months until he and other SOE agents contrived to escape in July 1942.  On his second mission from November 1942 until November 1943, he created, organised, and led the Farmer network (or circuit), sometimes called the Sylvestre-Farmer network, based in Lille. He led many successful sabotage operations before being betrayed by a member of his network and killed in a gun battle with the German military police.\nTypically, SOE agents worked with local resistance leaders, assisting and influencing them but not directly commanding resistance groups and fighters. However, \"Capitaine Michel\" was both the creator and the commander of the Farmer network, \"an accomplished organiser, an audacious saboteur, and an inspirational leader.\" He headed a \"powerful circuit of more than 800 resisters of the German occupation, with an escape line, an intelligence gathering service, and numerous parachute reception grounds.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Special Operations Executive", "response": ["A variety of people from all classes and pre-war occupations served SOE in the field. The backgrounds of agents in F Section, for example, ranged from aristocrats such as Polish-born Countess Krystyna Skarbek, and Noor Inayat Khan, the daughter of an Indian Sufi leader, to working-class people such as Violette Szabo and Michael Trotobas, with some even reputedly from the criminal underworld. Some of them were recruited by word of mouth among the acquaintances of SOE's officers, others responded to routine trawls of the armed forces for people with unusual languages or other specialised skills."]}, {"page": "Gustave Bi\u00e9ler", "response": ["On 18 November 1942, Bi\u00e9ler, along with wireless operator Arthur Staggs and Michael Trotobas, were parachuted into France.

Author Murphy speculates that the raid may have been a sham and that Cole had been a German agent before his arrest. Whatever the truth, Cole quickly complied with the German demand for information about the Pat Line. He wrote a 30 page statement for the Germans which identified dozens of his associates and described the operations of the northern section of the Pat Line. Arrests of Cole's former associates began that same day. Fran\u00e7ois Duprez was one of the first arrested; Abb\u00e9 Pierre Carpentier was arrested 8 December. Duprez later died in a German concentration camp and Carpentier was executed. Cole accompanied the Germans on some arrests. Cole, however, withheld some names and information from the Germans. He did not betray Jeannine Voglimacci, the hair dresser in La Madeleine, but wrote her a letter threatening retribution if she continued to work for the Pat Line.
