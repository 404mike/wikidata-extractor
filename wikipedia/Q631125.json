In January 2007, he signed for Cardiff City for a fee of \u00a3350,000.\nIn eleven seasons at Cardiff, Whittingham played 457 competitive matches and scored 96 goals, putting him seventh on the all-time appearances list and ninth among their goalscorers. During his time at that club they won the Championship in 2013, and reached the 2008 FA Cup Final and 2012 League Cup Final. He was named three times in the Championship's PFA Team of the Year, and his 20-goal haul in the 2009\u201310 season made him the division's top scorer. He signed for Blackburn Rovers in June 2017, and made 24 appearances for the club before his contract was terminated by mutual consent in August 2018. He died in March 2020, as a result of an accidental fall at a pub.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 8", "response": ["*  1984   \u2013 Peter Whittingham, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Nuneaton", "response": ["* Peter Whittingham, footballer (born in Whitestone, Nuneaton)"]}, {"page": "EFL Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Peter Whittingham"]}, {"page": "Dave Jones (footballer, born 1956)", "response": ["The start of the 2009\u201310 season saw Cardiff in top form beating Scunthorpe United 4\u20130 putting them top.
