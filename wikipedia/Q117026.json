In 1881 he was found guilty of the fatal poisoning of his mistress's husband.Evans and Skinner, Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell, p. 209 He was imprisoned in the Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet, Illinois, from November 1881 until his release on good behaviour on 31 July 1891.

Abberline thought Chapman was the Ripper because during the original investigation, he had closely interviewed Chapman's first \"wife\", Lucie Badewski, and she had told him that her husband often used to go out during the night for hours on end. Speculation in contemporary newspaper accounts and books has led to Chapman, like fellow serial killer Thomas Neill Cream, becoming one of many suspects in the infamous Ripper murders.
