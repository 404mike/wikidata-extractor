This was often a ploy used by the poorer county clubs to recruit talented cricketers of limited means: the secretarial duties were often light and mainly done by volunteers, but employment as secretary meant that a player could maintain amateur status. In Crawford's case, there were other considerations, as he had been born in Leicester and his younger brother was already a member of the team. Amateur status meant that he was available to captain the side in the absence of the regular captain, Charles de Trafford, and he did so several times in his first season with the county, 1903, and more than 30 times until his career ended in 1910.
