Le Mesurier was unsure about taking the part as he was finishing the final series of George and the Dragon and did not want another long-term television role. He was persuaded both by an increase in his fee\u2014to \u00a3262\u00a010s (\u00a3262.50) per episode\u2014and by the casting of his old friend Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones. Le Mesurier was initially unsure of how to portray his character, and was advised by series writer Jimmy Perry to make the part his own. Le Mesurier decided to base the character on himself, later writing that \"I thought, why not just be myself, use an extension of my own personality and behave rather as I had done in the army? So I always left a button or two undone, and had the sleeve of my battle dress slightly turned up. I spoke softly, issued commands as if they were invitations (the sort not likely to be accepted) and generally assumed a benign air of helplessness\". Perry later observed that \"we wanted Wilson to be the voice of sanity; he has become John\"."]}, {"page": "1986 in film", "response": ["| Mona Lisa || Island Pictures / HandMade Films || Neil Jordan (director/screenplay); David Leland (screenplay); Bob Hoskins, Cathy Tyson, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Caine, Clarke Peters, Kate Hardie, Zoe Nathenson, Sammi Davis, Rod Bedall, Joe Brown, Pauline Melville, Hossein Karimbeik, Maggie O'Neill, Bryan Coleman, Robert Dorning, Perry Fenwick, John Darling || Crime, Drama || Live action"]}, {"page": "Bootsie and Snudge", "response": ["*Robert Dorning \u2013 Hesketh Pendleton (series 1 \u2013 3)"]}, {"page": "Comedy Playhouse", "response": ["Current Affairs (31 May 1968) starring Harold Goodwin, Robert Dorning, Damaris Hayman, Bruce Wightman, Roger Avon and Eric Francis", "The Loves of Larch Hill (12 May 1969) starring Robert Dorning, Gillian Blake and Denis Cleary"]}, {"page": "Q...
