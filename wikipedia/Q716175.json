On 3 December 2011, Krul made his 50th Newcastle appearance against Chelsea. He saved a Frank Lampard penalty and made several other impressive saves, although Newcastle went on to lose the game 3\u20130. On 3 March 2012, Krul signed a new five-year contract at Newcastle United. Krul then went on to play in the away game against Arsenal, which Newcastle lost 2\u20131. During the match, fellow Dutchman Robin van Persie accused Krul of wasting time throughout the match and taunted Krul after the match had ended. The row continued into the tunnel and the two players had to be separated. Although he received criticism from Arsenal player Jack Wilshere, teammate James Perch defended Krul, believing van Persie \"out of order\".

His first home win on return to the Premier League came on 22 August, when Newcastle thrashed Aston Villa 6\u20130, with three goals from Andy Carroll, two goals from Kevin Nolan and one from Joey Barton. Hughton received praise for his calm management style to stabilise the club, shrewd signings and guiding Newcastle back to the Premier League. Prior to Newcastle's 1\u20131 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and away win at Everton, he completed the signings of Cheick Tiot\u00e9 and Hatem Ben Arfa. Despite leading his newly promoted side to healthy ninth place by the end of October, unrest came when star player Andy Carroll was arrested for assault. Newcastle followed this with wins at West Ham United and a memorable 5\u20131 derby victory against Sunderland. Both before and after the victory Hughton received the backing of his players and the Newcastle supporters.

He only realised the full extent of the ankle injury at the end of the season, and he had an operation to correct it. He was out for three months, including the first month or so of Newcastle's season. Simpson returned to action from his injury lay off, playing two reserve games in October.

The match proved to be controversial, with Emanuel Villa scoring at both ends to make the score 1\u20131. Lewis McGugan was given a straight red card, then a 93rd-minute penalty for Derby was saved by former Ram Lee Camp, with manager Colin Calderwood commenting after that the save would go down in the folklore. Veteran striker Andrew Cole then had his contract cancelled by \"mutual consent\" after the ex-Manchester United forward had fallen out with the club, as he was often being left on the bench. Forest followed up the Derby draw with another 1\u20131 draw at home to promotion-chasing Birmingham City and then a 2\u20132 draw away to Bristol City; the latter match saw Camp save another injury-time penalty and a point, seeing Forest into a four-game unbeaten run. However, they then lost 2\u20131 at home to Norwich City to return to the bottom of the table. A further 0\u20130 away draw at relegation rivals Doncaster Rovers saw mass tabloid speculation that manager Colin Calderwood was set to be replaced by Billy Davies. In the next game, at home to Barnsley, Forest won by a 36th-minute header from Joe Garner, moving off the foot of the table to 23rd. Forest drew 2\u20132 at Coventry City, twice coming from behind to claim a point, but their poor home form continued with a 1\u20130 home loss to Sheffield United and a 0\u20130 draw against relegation rivals Blackpool. Forest then recorded an important victory away at Southampton, with defender Wes Morgan scoring his first goal of the season and Joe Garner chipping the goalkeeper from 35 yards. This took Forest to just one point off safety, with their next game at home to bottom-of-the-table Doncaster Rovers, but Forest were 4\u20130 down within an hour and down to ten men for much of the second half after Julian Bennett came off injured after Forest had used all their substitutions, with a cruciate-ligament injury ruling the left-back out for the rest of the season. Forest replied with two late goals, but immediately after the game the Forest board terminated manager Colin Calderwood's contract after two and a half years in charge of the club; assistant manager David Kerslake was also dismissed. Reserve-team manager John Pemberton took caretaker charge at Norwich City, which Forest won 3\u20132 to rise out of the relegation zone for the first time in three months; this game saw the end of Lee Camp's loan spell. On 1 January, Nottingham Forest appointed Billy Davies as their new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal with David Kelly named as his assistant manager. Davies watched the next match, against nouveau-riche Premier League side Manchester City in the FA Cup third round, which saw Forest won 3\u20130 with goals from strikers Nathan Tyson, Robert Earnshaw and Joe Garner. Davies' first game in charge saw Forest go to bottom of the table Charlton Athletic and beat the strugglers 2\u20130, with Tyson and Earnshaw netting for the Reds. Their third victory in a row pushed Forest up to 21st and moved them closer to teams directly above them. A 2\u20130 home win Plymouth Argyle moved them into 20th before a big rival match in the FA Cup against Derby County at Pride Park, which ended 1\u20131. There will be a replay on 4 February at the City Ground. This was followed up by a 2\u20131 home win against Sheffield Wednesday, in which Forest came from behind to win. The result put them 17th, four points clear of the relegation zone. February saw just one win for Forest at the end of the month against promotion chasing Reading. Forest lost their opening game of February to local rivals Derby in the FA Cup. Forest then drew 1\u20131 with QPR before going on a three-game losing streak to Birmingham City, Ipswich Town and Derby this time in the league. After the bitter disappointment of picking up just one victory in February, Forest were looking to get off to the best possible start, and they did against Preston in a 2\u20131 victory with a brace from Rob Earnshaw sending Forest three places up the table into 18th and looking a lot less likely to face the drop after another good result this time a 1\u20131 draw to Swansea City. However another three game losing streak to Watford, a 5\u20130 loss to Burnley and then a 1\u20130 defeat to Wolves thanks to a Michael Kightly goal saw Forest take another dramatic downturn and they slipped in the league table to the regulation place of 22nd. Forest knew that with just six games left to stay in the Championship they needed something special. After a 1\u20131 draw against Barnsley following a desperate equaliser from Rob Earnshaw, Forest still sat in the drop zone. Up next were Bristol City, when city went ahead through Ivan Sproule things looked bleak again at the City Ground. Rob Earnshaw again showed his fantastic ability to score vital goals after grabbing an equaliser but with twelve minutes to go Forest went 2\u20131 down thanks to Dele Adebola. Forest turned things round in a fantastic comeback, Joe Garner making it 2\u20132 and then in stoppage time on loan Dexter Blackstock grabbed the late winner to give Forest a vital three points and climb themselves out of the drop zone. A midweek match against Sheffield United followed the fantastic win against City but it was a dull affair. After Kelvin Wilson was sent off early on, Forest's best chance fell to Joe Garner who fired over the crossbar and the Red's had to settle for a 0\u20130 draw that put them back into the drop zone on goal difference with Barnsley. Coventry City was the next opponents Forest had to face. Forest seemed more likely too pick up a result as the match was at the City Ground following the hysterics last week against Bristol City. And the only goal from James Perch after 46 minutes gave Forest a well-deserved win sending them up to 20th and out the drop zone, however they could not be complacent yet as both Norwich City and Barnsley, the two teams behind them had games in hand. Following the draw at Coventry, Forest saw that both Barnsley and Norwich failed to pick up a result that threatened Forest's safety. The early kick off saw on 25 April saw Forest hold Blackpool to a 1\u20131 draw at Bloomfield Road. Barnsley played Wolves and looked to have won what was a vital game however a late equaliser for Wolves saw Forest with a chance to stay up if Norwich were to lose to Reading. And they did, two goals from Shane Long meant Forest had escaped the drop. On the final day Forest beat already relegated Southampton 3\u20131 and secure 19th place just behind rivals Derby County.", "| James Perch"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["|James Perch"]}, {"page": "2007 Football League One play-off Final", "response": ["Yeovil Town's opponents for their play-off semi-final were Nottingham Forest with the first match of the two-legged tie taking place at Huish Park in Yeovil on 11 May 2007.

Kris Commons struck the spot-kick into the bottom corner of the goal to make it 1\u20130 to the visitors.
