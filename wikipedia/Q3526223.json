An all-round cricketer, Townsend was classically stylish, left-handed batsman, who was able to hit well despite his slender build. His off-side strokes were particularly effective, and his driving allowed him to score at a consistent pace throughout his major innings. In his younger days Townsend was also a spin bowler, who relied chiefly on a big break from leg but could also turn the ball the other way. He was often extremely difficult on sticky wickets but very rarely effective on good ones.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 7", "response": ["*1876 \u2013 Charlie Townsend, English cricketer and lawyer (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "October 17", "response": ["*  1958   \u2013 Charlie Townsend, English cricketer and lawyer (b. 1876)"]}, {"page": "1876", "response": ["** Charlie Townsend, English cricketer (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "1958", "response": ["** Charlie Townsend, English cricketer (born 1876)"]}, {"page": "1898 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Wilfred Rhodes, Bill Storer, Charlie Townsend, Albert Trott, William Lockwood"]}, {"page": "Clifton College", "response": ["* Charlie Townsend, England cricketer"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Charlie Townsend"]}, {"page": "Charles Townsend", "response": ["* Charlie Townsend (1876\u20131958), Gloucestershire cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of International cricket families", "response": ["* Charlie Townsend"]}, {"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Since then Gloucestershire's fortunes have been mixed and they have never won the official County Championship.
