During his time with the Lancashire club, Jones was loaned out to Cercle Brugge of the Belgian First Division. He was released by Blackburn in the summer of 2006 and, after a brief spell at Ashton United, joined League Two side Shrewsbury Town in November 2006. He featured sporadically for Shrewsbury and spent time out on loan at Conference National club Kidderminster Harriers in February 2008. Jones signed for Kidderminster on a permanent basis ahead of the 2008\u201309 season and played regularly. After a year at Kidderminster, he spent one season at Mansfield Town, before becoming Forest Green Rovers' club captain for the 2010\u201311 campaign. He returned to Kidderminster the following season, and then re-joined another of his former clubs, Mansfield Town, in June 2012. His second spell at Mansfield was a successful one, with the club winning the Conference National title. At the end of the season, in May 2013, Jones signed for League One side Stevenage on a free transfer before returning to Mansfield for a third time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Drewe Broughton", "response": ["On 8 September 2011, he joined Alfreton Town as a free agent, having been without a club since being released by Lincoln City. He had shaken off a minor hamstring injury which saw him have to be substituted during two run-outs in pre-season friendlies with Alfreton (against Sheffield United and Matlock Town). He debuted for the club in their 3\u20131 Conference defeat at his former club Kidderminster Harriers on 17 September 2011, scoring a 31st-minute penalty before attracting attention for an alleged elbow on Luke Jones. The incident was missed by the match referee but not by the referee's assessor who later requested a copy of the matchday DVD from Alfreton Town and, upon reviewing the incident, reported Broughton to the Football Association who took immediate action and banned him for three games. He returned from suspension to appear in the 5\u20132 defeat at Grimsby Town on 1 October 2011 but was sent-off for elbowing Gary Silk in the 86th minute. After being handed a four match ban for the offence, Broughton was sacked by the club on 5 October 2011, with Alfreton chairman Wayne Bradley commenting that \"the actions of Drewe Broughton on Saturday were wholly unacceptable and the club has made a decision to sever relationships with the player. He was a non-contract player and, while we understand his disappointment with himself and his pleas that it was completely out of character for him, we have made our decision and he has kicked his last ball for Alfreton Town\"."]}, {"page": "Ben Herd", "response": ["In the 2006\u201307 season injuries restricted Herd to 31 league appearances.

Substitute Andy Drury's strike sealed the win and Mansfield's misery was complete when Luke Jones was sent off. Stevenage lost their second successive away game, losing 1\u20130 at Rushden & Diamonds.

This meant it was the fifth straight season that Stevenage had opened their campaign with a home fixture. The game ended 4\u20133 in Oldham's favour, with six of the seven goals coming in the second-half. Stevenage's Darius Charles gave the home side the lead just before half-time, firing in from close range after Luke Jones' header had rebounded back off the post. The visitors then scored three unanswered times after the interval. The first came courtesy of a James Tarkowski volley from Jose Baxter's inswinging free-kick. Baxter then gave Oldham the lead from the penalty spot, before Cristian Monta\u00f1o ran the length of the pitch to double their advantage. Stevenage fought back with two goals in seven minutes; new signing Oumare Tounkara squared the ball for Greg Tansey to finish from six yards out, and then Filipe Morais levelled after beating the offside trap following Tansey's floated free-kick. With just three minutes remaining, Baxter scored his second goal from the penalty spot after Charles was adjudged to have handled the ball when blocking Charlie MacDonald's shot, with the goal ensuring the three points went the way of the visitors. A second league defeat followed a week later, with the club losing 1\u20130 to Swindon Town at the County Ground, courtesy of Massimo Luongo's 25-yard first-half strike. A week later, Stevenage fell to their third consecutive league defeat, a 1\u20130 home defeat to Leyton Orient, with a Kevin Lisbie header settling the match in the first-half. Following three successive league defeats by a one-goal margin, Stevenage secured their first league win of the season on 24 August, winning 1\u20130 away at Notts County. The only goal of the game came in injury-time, with James Dunne firing home following good work from Robin Shroot down the left wing.
