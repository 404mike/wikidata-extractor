Without formal education, she made a name for herself in botany, ornithology and entomology. She was also an accomplished poet and painter, and illustrated her scientific contributions that were published by learned societies such as the Royal Entomological Society in London, the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, and the Linnean Society of London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roland Trimen", "response": ["Trimen received butterfly specimens from a network of friends including Bowker and his sister Mary Elizabeth Barber.

Their ongoing correspondence took place during a time when it was not generally accepted for women to engage in scientific discussion; indeed, in the beginning Barber did not disclose the fact that she was a woman. Barber became one of Harvey's main suppliers of plants from South Africa and also assisted him in the naming and classification of numerous species. Over a nearly 30-year correspondence, she sent Harvey approximately 1,000 species with notes on each one."]}, {"page": "Aloidendron barberae", "response": ["Aloidendron barberae was first collected and submitted for classification by Mary Elizabeth Barber, who was a plant collector in the former Transkei. She sent specimens of the plant and its flowers to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, where in 1874 it was named by  William Turner Thiselton-Dyer (1843\u20131928) in her honor. Subsequently, it was also found in KwaZulu-Natal by the well known traveller, explorer and painter Thomas Baines in 1873. He also sent a specimen to Kew, where it was named Aloe bainesii. Although it was known as A. bainseii for many years, Aloe barberae was the name first given to this plant, and takes precedence according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature,Aloe barberae by Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden and so is the epithet used in the combination Aloidendron barberae."]}, {"page": "Mary Elizabeth", "response": ["*Mary Elizabeth Barber (1818\u20131899), British natural historian"]}, {"page": "Canteen Kopje", "response": ["Earlier Stone Age artefacts were noted in the area by Colonel James Henry Bowker and Mary Elizabeth Barber at the time of the earliest diamond diggings.

In 1912 his family moved to Kenya, where he encountered African and Arab subjects that later formed an important theme in his work.  From 1915 to 1918 he served as a soldier in East Africa.  From 1919 to 1922 he studied at the Grahamstown School of Art, and from 1923 at the Royal College of Art in London, under Henry Moore and Derwent Wood. He returned to Kenya in 1927 and set up a studio there.
