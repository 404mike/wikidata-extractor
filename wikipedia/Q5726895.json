However, it is usual to search for solutions with the minimum number of parts. Far from being minimal, the square trisection proposed by Abu'l-Wafa' uses 9 pieces. In the 14th century Abu Bakr al-Khalil gave two solutions, one of which uses 8 pieces.Alpay \u00d6zdural (2000).

If the sides of the two squares forming the tiling are the numbers a and b, then the closest distance between corresponding points on congruent squares is c, where c is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle having sides a and b. For instance, in the illustration to the left, the two squares in the Pythagorean tiling have side lengths 5 and 12 units long, and the side length of the tiles in the overlaying square tiling is 13, based on the Pythagorean triple (5,12,13)."]}, {"page": "Washington Teasdale", "response": ["Teasdale, who delivered hundreds of lectures throughout his lifetime, was a founding member of the Leeds Photographic Society, the Royal Society of Microscopy and was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
