A notable storyline arc for the character was her rape at the hands of a patient's husband. Producers hoped the plot would raise awareness of the dangers nurses face at work, as well as increase ratings.

They convince him to come back to Holby, but they are involved in a bus crash on the way. Tina accepts Sam's decision to leave the hospital.", "As the rape storyline concluded, Goose teased a potential romance for her character. The actress had suggested Tina was given a love interest, as she wanted to show that it is part of recovering from an assault. Tina later begins a relationship with senior house officer Sean Maddox (Gerald Kyd). He is the first person she has sex with following her rape. A love triangle develops when Sean has an affair with Tina's best friend Chloe Hill (Jan Anderson). At the end of the thirteenth series, Tina discovers Sean has gotten Chloe pregnant. Goose told Wendy Granditer of Inside Soap that Tina feels \"totally betrayed\" by Sean and Chloe, but instead of getting upset, she begins acting aggressively towards the pair. Goose was pleased with the changes to Tina's personality during the storyline, saying \"When she first started in the show she was bubbly, but that was all. Now I get the chance to show another side to her, the bitchy side that comes out when she finds out about Sean and Chloe.\" The actress admitted that when she played Tina's new \"no-nonsense\" side, she got a bit bored shouting all the time, so she asked the directors if she could change things to avoid the audience growing tired of Tina behaviour."]}]}}
