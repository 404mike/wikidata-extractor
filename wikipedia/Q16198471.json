'American Grandeur' and its leading single 'Soldier' got a fair share of support. Notably, Bloomberg's rock critic 'Mark Beech' compared the band to ABBA and described the EP as a \"unbland blend of pop hooks and very slick production\"HighBeam as well as Clash Music's 'Robin Murray' describing the leadsingle 'Soldier' as a \"piano led stomper\" and \"pop in the grandest loosest sense of the word\". The single made it into Music Week's Upfront Club Chart where it peaked at position #7. Off the back of the release, the band performed a showcase at 'Notting Hill Arts Club' in London supported by California Gypsies and The Arches.

The display is helped hugely by the long tradition in West Africa of music, from the most ancient to the era of rap.\"Vincent Dowd, \"West Africa: A forgotten heritage revealed\", BBC News, 18 October 2015. The reviewer for Francophone Africa pointed out: \"The main strength of this exhibition is the focus on having the stories and symbols of West Africa told by West Africans themselves rather than through a European lens. This is not always possible (for example some of the ethnographic recordings), but it does a fantastic job of not depriving the main actors of their voices.\"\"REVIEW. West Africa: word, symbol, song at the British Library\", Francophone Africa, University of Portsmouth, 3 December 2015. For Mark Beech of Dante magazine, \"Some of the most powerful displays are by those who experienced exploitation and managed to escape. Ignatius Sancho, who was born on a slave ship and went on to become an influential intellectual figure, and Phillis Wheatley, who was enslaved as a child and went on to write Romantic poetry.\"Mark Beech, \"London celebrates African culture in word, symbol and song\", Dante, 2015. Other highlights that drew comment from African reviewers included: \"Most enlightening are the sections devoted to African orthography that pre-dates the introduction of the Roman alphabet by Europeans as well as newer scripts like N'ko, invented by Souleymane Kant\u00e9 in 1947 and used by speakers of the Dioula, Bambara and Malinka languages.... \u2018The Building States\u2019 section is a heartening reminder that prior to the transatlantic slave trade and colonisation, West Africa was home to formidable empires such as those of Ghana (modern day Mauritania and Mali), the Songhai, the Wolof, Mali and the Kingdom of Asante.\"Tolita, \"Highlights from the \u2018West Africa: Word, Symbol, Song\u2019 Exhibition @ the British Library, London\", 20 January 2016."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*Mark Beech, 60, British music critic, complications from a traffic collision.Beech, longtime Bloomberg News employee, dies at 60 (death announced on this date)"]}, {"page": "Music to Be Murdered By", "response": ["The album's title and alternative cover art share the same concept as the 1958 album Alfred Hitchcock Presents Music to Be Murdered By, which interspersed audio of the director Alfred Hitchcock's wry, dark humor into easy listening instrumentals arranged by Jeff Alexander. Eminem tweeted an image of the 1958 album cover featuring Hitchcock holding an axe and a gun to his head and stated that his album's alternative cover was \"inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!\" Audio of Hitchcock's voice from the 1958 album is sampled in the interludes \"Alfred\" and \"Alfred (Outro)\" and the beginning of the track \"Little Engine\". Both the 1958 and 2020 albums end with Hitchcock stating, \"If you haven\u2019t been murdered, I can only say better luck next time. If you have been, goodnight, wherever you are.\" Mark Beech of Forbes magazine connected the alternate cover to this album's concept of murder and violence."]}]}}
