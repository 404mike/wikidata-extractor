While working at the British Museum 1961\u20131964, he rediscovered the Epic of Atrahasis, which had lain unrecognised in a drawer for some decades. From 1964 to 1970 he was Librarian at Tyndale Library, Cambridge, and taught Akkadian for a year at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in the University of London. In 1970 he was appointed Rankin Lecturer in Hebrew and Ancient Semitic Languages at Liverpool. He was a Fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1984, studying in a team led by Yigael Yadin. His main interest lies in Semitic epigraphy, and in editing Akkadian cuneiform tablets and Aramaic inscriptions. Scribal practices in the ancient Near East remain a dominant concern for him; the importance he ascribes to this topic stems largely from his belief as an Evangelical Christian in the essential historicity of the Bible \u2013 a point of view he shares with his colleague at Liverpool, the Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen.\nMillard is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a member of the Society for Old Testament Studies \u2013 and was also, until recently, Vice-Chairman of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wedding at Cana", "response": ["Many throughout history have sought to recover the lost jars. On December 21, 2004, archaeologists reported finding in Kafr Kanna \"pieces of large stone jars of the type the Gospel says Jesus used when he turned water into wine\". But American scientists excavating the rival site of Khirbet Qana north of it, also claimed to have found pieces of stone jars from the time of Jesus. Fellow archaeologist Shimon Gibson cast doubt on the value of such finds for identifying the town meant by John, since such vessels are not rare and it would be impossible to link a particular set of vessels to the miracle. \"Just the existence of stone vessels is not enough to prove that this is a biblical site.\" Several stone jars of the type described by the Gospel of John were found for instance in Jerusalem: \"At least six of them stood in the basement kitchen of the [first-century CE] 'Burnt house'. They were shaped and finished on a very big lathe, given a pedestal foot and simple decoration. Such stone jars would hold large quantities of water for washing and kitchen needs. Flat discs of stone served as lids. The jars at Cana may have been similar to these\", wrote Alan Millard."]}, {"page": "Atra-Hasis", "response": ["*Alan Millard"]}, {"page": "Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project", "response": ["| II || The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire 910\u2013612 BC || Alan Millard || 1994"]}, {"page": "A.R.
