He stood as a Coalition Conservative, but in a three-way contest his \"coalition coupon\" was not enough to wrest the seat from the Labour Party candidate John Swan. Rogerson stood again at the 1922 election, when he was helped by the absence of a Liberal Party candidate, and won the seat with a narrow majority over Swan.Rogerson's tenure as Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnard Castle was short-lived. At the 1922 election, Moss Turner-Samuels retook the seat for Labour with a majority of over 10%.  After his defeat, Rogerson did not stand for Parliament again. He died in 1925, aged 60.", "link_mentions": []}}
