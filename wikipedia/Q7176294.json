Michael Bonner of Uncut described the record as a \"masterpiece\" and said, \"Released in the interzone between post-punk and synth pop, and reflecting both, Soul Mining thrums with ideas, tension and dread. Johnson's enduring lyrical concerns \u2013 social alienation, political disillusionment and troubles of the heart \u2013 are all present and correct, but unlike the industrial/psychedelic adventuring of Burning Blue Soul, they are here given a glossier sheen... Certainly, for an album of heavy themes, Soul Mining is musically surprisingly light.\" He concluded, \"Soul Mining is arguably Johnson's defining work: ambitious, strange, exciting. And, 30-odd years on, remarkably fresh.\" In Q Peter Paphides described the album as being \"like one long distress signal from someone being held against their will inside a Sartre novel\". He stated, \"The years might not have been quite so kind to Soul Mining were it not for the inspired guest performances that Johnson teased out of his collaborators\", singling out Holland's piano solo as \"a high point on an album full of them\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian also noted Holland's \"genuinely astonishing performance\" and said, \"The lyrics contained the occasional hint of histrionic gaucheness \u2013 'the cancer of love has eaten out my heart' seems a pretty melodramatic way to say you got dumped \u2013 but more often they're strikingly precocious: 'Uncertain Smile's brilliant drawing of a confused relationship, 'The Twilight Hour's painfully accurate depiction of self-obsession... More striking still is the ease with which Johnson marshals a kaleidoscopic array of musical influences into something coherent and unique. Quite aside from Holland's boogie-woogie piano, over the course of Soul Minings seven tracks, you variously hear folk fiddles and accordion, the popping basslines of contemporary funk, punishing industrial beats, electronics derived from New York's then current club music... But Soul Mining never sounds disjointed, never feels like an exercise in smart-alec showboating: Johnson's songwriting holds its disparate elements tightly together.\" He concluded, \"Soul Mining is a brilliant and very idiosyncratic album. Maybe that's why it's never really cited as an influence these days: you can't hope to mimic something this personal and unique.\""]}, {"page": "Watford Gap services", "response": ["The services' association with 1960s musicians is remembered in a set of photographs published in 2008 of the Stones stopping at Watford Gap on the way to ATV Studios, Birmingham in 1963.
