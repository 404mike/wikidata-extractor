The best known footballers of their eras to come from Dumfries are probably Dave Halliday, Ian Dickson, Bobby Ancell, Billy Houliston, Jimmy McIntosh, Willie McNaught and Ted McMinn. Halliday, Dickson, Houliston and McMinn played for home town club, Queen of the South during their careers. Dominic Matteo was born in Dumfries but moved to England while still a young boy. Barry Nicholson lost 4\u20133 to Queens playing for Aberdeen in the 2008 Scottish Cup semi-finals despite scoring against the team he supported as a boy. Ancell, Houliston, McNaught and Nicholson have represented Scotland and were joined in having done so in season 2010/11 by Cammy Bell and Grant Hanley. Matteo gained 6 full caps for Scotland after having represented England at under-21 level. Halliday was overlooked by Scotland in favour of Hughie Gallacher. Gallacher played for The Queen's but was not from Dumfries. It was as a manager rather than a player that Thomas Mitchell made his name as a multiple FA Cup winner at Blackburn Rovers before joining Woolwich Arsenal as Arsenal F.C. were then named."]}, {"page": "Blackburn Rovers F.C.", "response": ["|2015\u201316|| Grant Hanley"]}, {"page": "Ga\u00ebl Givet", "response": ["On 24 August 2011, Givet made his first appearance of the 2011\u201312 season, playing the full 90 minutes against Sheffield Wednesday at Ewood Park in the second round of the League Cup.

On 17 September, he started the league game with Arsenal and completed the full 90 minutes at Ewood Park in a 4\u20133 victory in the left-back berth. On 20 September, he captained Rovers in their League Cup third round tie against Leyton Orient at Ewood Park which ended in a 3\u20132 win for Rovers and also played the full 90 minutes alongside Grant Hanley. On 24 September, Givet started and played the full 90 minutes against Newcastle United at St. James' Park in a 3\u20131 defeat.

He was forced to leave the game against Sunderland on 11 December due to heart palpitations. Immediately suffering heart palpitations, Givet was taken to hospital and was to be monitored by club doctors, tested for an ongoing heart condition and the club are hopeful that the routine tests would show no problems. After suffering heart palpitations, manager Steve Kean recalled Givet suffering heart palpitations, told Givet to get off pitch before he collapsed and club doctor was unable to regulate heart beat.", "On 4 February 2012, Givet received a red card just two minutes before half-time after a challenge on Robin van Persie as Blackburn were heavily defeated by Arsenal, 7\u20131. Since his sending off, he did not make his first appearance and rumors began to spread that Kean had been leaving Givet out because of a contract clause but Kean dismissed them. Despite not on the bench for Blackburn in a 3\u20130 defeat to Swansea City, Kean revealed he did not choose Givet stating was \"not in the right frame of mind\" to play. Afterwards, Givet said that he wanted to leave Blackburn in the summer. On 21 April 2012, he, however, was selected to start against Norwich City at Ewood Park in the Premier League and played the full 90 minutes, replacing the injured Scottish defender Grant Hanley. On 7 May 2012, Givet started the Premier League game alongside Scott Dann against Wigan at Ewood Park in a crucial game knowing that a win would put them on course for survival, but during half-time, he suffered a heart scare after a row with manager Steve Kean and from being upset that Rovers were going down. He therefore was substituted for midfielder Radosav Petrovi\u0107. The match finished 1\u20130 to Wigan, relegating Blackburn."]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (2000\u20132019)", "response": ["|Grant Hanley"]}]}}
