Lorraine Copeland and Peter J. Wescombe preferred use of the term \"Meyroubian\" after one site was found that was not in the mountains. The term is used to describe around twenty five known surface sites with assemblages of around eighty percent Middle Paleolithic to twenty percent Upper Paleolithic in form.Fleisch, Henri., Les stations pr\u00e9historiques de montagne au Liban, VI' Congr\u00e8s de l'UlSPP (Rome, 1962) O. Prufer and E. Baldwin noted a resemblance to those in levels seven and nine of Yabrud Shelter I. Henri Fleisch suggested successive occupations from the Middle Paleolithic to the Upper Paleolithic at all sites apart from Jebel Mazloum, which was classed as a transitional Upper Paleolithic site. Francis Hours suggested it was a transitional industry between the Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic periods and was placed by Copeland and Wescombe in the final Mousterian."]}, {"page": "Heavy Neolithic", "response": ["The term \"Heavy Neolithic\" was translated by Lorraine Copeland and Peter J. Wescombe from Henri Fleisch's term \"gros Neolithique\", suggested by Dorothy Garrod (in a letter dated February 1965) for adoption to describe the particular flint industry that was identified at sites near Qaraoun in the Beqaa Valley.Fleisch, Henri, Nouvelles stations pr\u00e9historiques au Liban, BSPF, vol. 51, pp. 564-565, 1954. The industry was also termed \"Gigantolithic\" and confirmed as Neolithic by Alfred Rust and Dorothy Garrod."]}, {"page": "Shepherd Neolithic", "response": ["Shepherd Neolithic is a name given by archaeologists to a style (or industry) of small flint tools from the Hermel plains in the north Beqaa Valley, Lebanon.Fleisch, Henri., Les industries lithiques r\u00e9centes de la B\u00e9kaa, R\u00e9publique Libanaise, Acts of the 6th C.I.S.E.A., vol. XI, no. 1. Paris, 1960. The Shepherd Neolithic industry has been insufficiently studied and was provisionally named based on a limited typology collected by Jesuit archaeologist \"P\u00e8re\" Henri Fleisch. Lorraine Copeland and Peter J. Wescombe suggested it was possibly \"of quite late date\"."]}, {"page": "Antelias cave", "response": ["Antelias cave was destroyed by dynamite in the spring of 1964 due to quarrying in the area. Lorraine Copeland and Peter J. Wescombe recovered some cave deposits from which they hoped to extract material for radio-carbon dating."]}]}}
