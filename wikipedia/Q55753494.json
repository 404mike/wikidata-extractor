He ran the early Necker dialysis unit with Geoff Chisolm, following which he pursued his interest in urology under Alec Badenoch and Ian Todd. Wickham was later awarded the Fulbright scholarship, which led him to Lexington, Kentucky and the experience in intra-operative cooling for ischemic renal surgery."]}, {"page": "Ian Aird", "response": ["William J. Dempster, a Scottish surgeon who had trained in vascular surgery in France, carried out early animal renal transplants and explored the use of cortisone and radiation to suppress immunity and prolong graft survival. With Ralph Shackman, the urologist in Aird's team, he became an early pioneer of renal transplantation in the UK. Shackman and Dempster performed the first UK renal transplant between non-related donor and recipient."]}, {"page": "Jim Dempster", "response": ["In 1960 with Ralph Shackman, he carried out some of the earliest kidney transplants in the UK."]}]}}
