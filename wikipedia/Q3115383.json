All four goals came in the first half of the match, with Bournemouth taking a two-goal lead before two Stevenage goals within the space of seven minutes meant the teams went into the break level. The visitors opened the scoring through Wesley Thomas' half volley that found the top right corner of the goal. Bournemouth then doubled their advantage when Scott Malone made a bursting run from full back before hitting a rasping drive that found the net from the edge of the area. The hosts were looking second best, but reduced the two-goal deficit when Luke Freeman cut in from the left and curled a right footed shot past Bournemouth goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan from 25\u00a0yards.
