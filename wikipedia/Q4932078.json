A right-arm medium pace bowler, Clapp holds the record for the most List A wickets in one season for Somerset, with the 51 that he claimed in 1974. In the same year he also broke the record for the most wickets taken in a season in the John Player league (34) However, Clapp only played 15 first-class matches for Somerset. His 25 first-class wickets were taken at an average of 29.36. Despite his successful 1974 season, Clapp enjoyed only mediocre success in his other seasons of one-day cricket. He claimed 25 wickets in his three other seasons.  In 1977 the bulk of Clapp's cricket was for Somerset's Second XI, and he retired from county cricket at the end of the 1979 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["On 12 June 1974, he played against Hampshire at Taunton in a Benson & Hedges Cup (B&H Cup) quarter-final. Hampshire won the toss and decided to bat. They scored 182 all out with Botham taking two for 33 including the prize wicket of Barry Richards, bowled for 13. Botham was number nine in Somerset's batting order and came in with his team struggling at 113 for 7. Almost immediately, that became 113 for 8 and he had only the tailenders Hallam Moseley and Bob Clapp to support him. He was facing the West Indian fast bowler Andy Roberts who delivered a bouncer which hit him in the mouth. Despite heavy bleeding and the eventual loss of four teeth, Botham refused to leave the field and carried on batting. He hit two sixes and made 45*, enabling Somerset to win by one wicket. He won the Gold Award. Later, he said he should have left the field but was full of praise for Moseley and Clapp.", "Botham's career and ability level has been oft-debated.  For example, when naming him as a Cricketer of the Year in its 1978 edition, Wisden described Botham as \"a determined character who knows where he is aiming, and who will, quite naturally and fiercely, address himself to the interesting view that he is overrated\". Denis Compton would dismiss Botham as \"overrated\" and said he \"only did well because all the best players had joined Packer\": i.e., for World Series Cricket (WSC).Birley, p. 324.  Despite such conjecture on his talent level, Botham does not appear to have been a self-promoter; rather, he would readily give praise to his colleagues, for instance, his batting partners Hallam Moseley and Bob Clapp after the 1974 Benson and Hedges quarter-final against Hampshire; and to Bob Willis, the man whose bowling spell won the test match at Headingley in 1981."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bob Clapp (1972\u20131977) 15 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Bob Clapp"]}, {"page": "1986 John Player Special League", "response": ["The Nottinghamshire captain Clive Rice's 34 wickets for the season equalled Bob Clapp's Sunday League record.Benson and Hedges Cricket Year Fifth Edition: September 1985 to September 1986 Editor David Lemmon - page 441"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset List A cricket records", "response": ["* Wickets in Season: 51, Bob Clapp, 1974"]}]}}
