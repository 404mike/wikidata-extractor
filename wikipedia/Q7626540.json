He first recruited bassist Stuart Fletcher, who he saw by chance at the Fibbers venue in York where he was drinking with his guitar tech Martin Herbet. Fletcher was playing in local covers band, The Blueflies, as a last-minute replacement for the band's regular bass player who had pulled out of the gig. Squire then auditioned two singers \u2013 Sean O'Brien, previously of Warrington band the Steamboat Band, and Chris Helme, who was spotted by a friend of Squire's guitar tech busking outside Woolworths in York. Following several auditions and the prompting of his manager, Squire eventually settled on Helme, despite being hesitant because he \"closed his eyes when he sang and only folk singers do that\". While Helme was a songwriter too, Squire admitted early on that despite liking a couple of Helme's songs \u2013 including \"Blinded by the Sun\", which he re-arranged for the album \u2013 \"Yeah, he can write the odd tune but I don't really like them and it might be a problem later on if he wants to record them with the band\".", "Due to Squire's past work with the Stone Roses, the band were met with intense media interest and speculation before they had recorded or released anything. It had been rumoured that former bandmate Reni was set to join the band. It was then rumoured that a delay in recruiting a drummer was due to Squire's desire to get a drummer who, like Reni, could also sing backing vocals. However, in 2019 bassist Stuart Fletcher revealed that they had actually been working with a drummer called Mark McNeill who had to be dismissed from the band following several failed rehab visits as \"he couldn\u2019t remember anything we rehearsed\". The band name was also the subject of various conspiracy theories after the NME claimed that it was an anagram of He Hates Roses. Other alleged anagrams included The Rose Ashes and by dropping the definite article, She's A Rose. Squire responded \"That's pure coincidence. I chose the name because at the time, I kept seeing them everywhere and because some people think they don't exist. They are unusual because it is the male of the species who gets pregnant.\" Squire then changed the band's name from The Seahorses to simply Seahorses, but this was short lived after it turned out that another band had been using the name for several years.", "Helme pursued a solo career and went on to attack John Squire in the press, describing his material as \"muso wank\". He then formed The Yards with Stuart Fletcher and former Shed Seven guitarist Paul Banks in 2001, who released two albums on their own Industrial Erotica label before splitting in November 2009 and has since resurrected his solo career with the self-released album Ashes. He later commented on his relationship with Squire that \"I don't have any contact with him now, I didn't really when I was in the band \u2013 he was quite elusive."]}, {"page": "Chris Helme", "response": ["A friend of John Squire's long-time guitar technician Martin Herbet discovered Helme busking outside Woolworths department store in York's Coney Street.

Squire went to see Helme perform at Fibbers on 26 May and 16 June 1996. Another gig was then arranged at the Roadhouse venue in Manchester, where Squire invited Helme to join his new band, for which he had already recruited bassist Stuart Fletcher.", "Following The Seahorses' early demise, Helme undertook a short solo tour across England which culminated with a gig at the Improv Theatre in London.
