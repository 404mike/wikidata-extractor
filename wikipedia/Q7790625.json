He had a prolific and distinguished career, being elected President of the Royal Institute of British Architects 1870\u201373 and being awarded its Royal Gold Medal for Architecture in 1873. His reputation during his lifetime was largely as a safe establishment figure, and critical assessment has been less favourable more recently, particularly in comparison with his younger brother, the better known Matthew Digby Wyatt.", "link_mentions": {}}}
