He was raised in a large household by his grandparents Joseph Barron & Mary (n\u00e9e Reid) Barron along with his brother Alexander Barron and many other half-siblings and aunts and uncles. He emigrated to Canada in 1910, and enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1914.Barron was 24 years old, and a Corporal in the 3rd (Toronto) Battalion, CEF during the First World War when  he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 6 November 1917 at the Second Battle of Passchendaele, Belgium, when his unit was held up by three machine-guns, Corporal Barron opened fire on them at point-blank range, rushed the guns, killed four of the crew and captured the remainder. He then turned one of the captured guns on the retiring enemy, causing severe casualties. This action produced far-reaching results and enabled the advance to continue.He later achieved the rank of sergeant-major, and during the Second World War he served with the Royal Regiment of Canada. He is buried in Veteran's Section 7, grave 3562 at Prospect Cemetery, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 20", "response": ["*1893 \u2013 Colin Fraser Barron, Scottish-Canadian sergeant, Victoria Cross recipient (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada", "response": ["*Cpl Colin Fraser Barron, VC (November 6, 1917)"]}, {"page": "Colin Barron", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Fraser Barron"]}, {"page": "Thomas William Holmes", "response": ["Holmes died of cancer on 4 January 1950 and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery, Owen Sound, Ontario, on 7 January 1950 with full military honours.
