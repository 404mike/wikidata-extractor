He beat Gowling and Power to the Player of the Season award, and was also voted as the Away Player of the Season. During the season, he regularly issued an \"inspiring battle cry\" in the local press, talked up \"the biggest club in the Blue Square Bet Premier\", and also attempted to bring unity between the club's disgruntled supporters and embattled management. Holdsworth described Anyon as a \"big voice\", and praised his \"impeccable\" attitude. On the pitch his performances were seen as a \"huge ray of light\" from the start of the season, and coach Neil Gardner told the Lincolnshire Echo that he believed Anyon could go on to play at Championship level."]}, {"page": "Krystian Pearce", "response": ["Pearce joined National League North club Hereford on 30 August 2021.
