On 18 January 2016, Robins was sacked after a 5\u20130 away defeat to Blackpool. Nick Daws and Andy Dawson were placed in temporary charge of the club, with their first game (a 3\u20130 home win over Colchester United) coming on 23 January.

United climbed into the top 6 of League One with a 0\u20134 away victory over Plymouth Argyle on 26 August 2017. The club remained in a play-off spot for the majority of the season, however a disastrous run of form throughout February and March threw the Iron's play-off hopes into jeopardy.

The duo of Nick Daws and Andy Dawson regained their positions of Caretaker Manager and Assistant Caretaker Manager respectively, as they had done in 2016 prior to Alexander's appointment. The Iron slipped down to 9th in the League One standings as Daws and Dawson failed to record victories in their first two games in charge, however a 0\u20131 away victory over fellow play-off hopefuls Charlton Athletic was sufficient to propel Scunthorpe back up to 6th place. Three consecutive wins followed, with United securing their play-off position on 1 May 2018 with the final of these three victories (a 2\u20130 home win over Plymouth Argyle). Scunthorpe finished the season in 5th place meaning that the Iron were drawn against Rotherham United in the play-off semi-final. Despite holding the millers to a 2\u20132 draw in the first leg at Glanford Park, Scunthorpe were once again denied a trip to Wembley with a 2\u20130 away loss in the second leg.
