At , Yeomans was the tallest goalkeeper to have played for the \"Saints\" (along with George Ephgrave). Known as \"Tiny\", Yeomans was signed as understudy to Tommy Allen and consequently never enjoyed a lengthy run in the first team, making four appearances in April 1925 and eight in the following September/October."]}, {"page": "Len Stansbridge", "response": ["In 1945, he returned to Southampton and was re-engaged by his home-town club, appearing four times in League South matches as well as in all four matches played in the 1945\u201346 FA Cup tournament. On the re-commencement of League football in 1946, Stansbridge was once again second-choice, this time behind George Ephgrave, who had played for Aston Villa before the war. Stansbridge and Ephgrave competed for the No. 1 jersey over the next season and a half until Ian Black was signed in December 1947. Although Ephgrave left the club in the summer of 1948, Black's form meant that Stansbridge only made four further first-team appearances up to the summer of 1950, during which time Southampton narrowly missed out on promotion to the First Division three seasons in a row."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2004", "response": ["*George Ephgrave, 86, English footballer."]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["The year began poorly for the Saints with three consecutive losses away from home in which the side conceded 11 goals, prompting Dodgin to replace regular goalkeeper George Ephgrave with Len Stansbridge for much of the rest of the season. Through February and March, the team won four out of seven matches to move away from the relegation zone and back up to the top ten, although four straight losses saw them drop back down to 15th in April. Seven players were released by the club near the end of the month.
