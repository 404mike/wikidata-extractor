During his time as assistant secretary of the TUC, he was secretly being paid to write anti-communist propaganda by the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret branch of the UK Foreign Office which delt in weaponised disinformation, anti-communism, and pro-colonial propaganda. Feather's book Trade Unions:True or False was published via Background Books, a propaganda front for the IRD.

After the bill received royal assent, in September 1971 the TUC voted to require its member unions not to comply with its provisions (including registering as a union under the Act). The Transport and General Workers Union was twice fined for contempt of court over its refusal to comply. However, some smaller unions did comply and 32 were suspended from membership of the TUC at the 1972 congress."]}, {"page": "Feather (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Vic Feather (1908\u20131976), former General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress in Great Britain, 1969\u20131973"]}, {"page": "Victor Grayson Hardie Feather", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Feather"]}, {"page": "Victor Feather, Baron Feather of the City of Bradford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Feather"]}, {"page": "Baron Feather", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Feather"]}, {"page": "Victor Feather", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Feather"]}, {"page": "Feather, Victor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Feather"]}, {"page": "Idle, West Yorkshire", "response": ["as was Vic Feather, Trades union leader in 1908."]}, {"page": "Val Meets The VIPs", "response": ["*Lord Vic Feather (28 May 1974)"]}, {"page": "Vic Feather, Baron Feather", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Feather"]}, {"page": "Michael Clapham (industrialist)", "response": ["Almost immediately he was involved in talks with Heath and the union leaders along with Campbell Adamson to try to prevent industrial action. The CBI team's impression was that Heath showed a good deal more consideration and deference to the unions and to TUC leader Vic Feather. However, neither Heath nor Feather could exert much influence over hard line union men Jack Jones and Hugh Scanlon, and little progress was made. When the miners converted their overtime ban into a strike, Heath called a general election. Two days before polling day Adamson addressed a conference organised by the Industrial Society at which he was asked what the Conservatives should do, if re-elected, about the controversial Industrial Relations Act. Adamson replied \"if I were them I would try to get close to the unions and hammer out something better\", going on to say that amendment of the Act was not possible because \"it is so surrounded by hatred that we must have a more honest try at another Act\"."]}, {"page": "Victor Feather, Baron Feather", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Feather"]}, {"page": "UK miners' strike (1969)", "response": ["The Chair of the NCB, former Labour MP Alf Robens, proposed to resolve the dispute by conceding the wage claim of 27 shillings and 6 pence (\u00a31.375) per week.

Shachtman had also wound up his political organisation, although Dix remained close to Hal Draper, a former supporter of Shachtman in the U.S.  He himself left Labour in 1961, disappointed with Hugh Gaitskell's leadership, and developed an interest in anarchism, but he rejoined Labour in 1963, and also began working as the publicity and research officer of the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE).  Although he was able to reinvent the union's newspaper, he had a poor working relationship with Sydney Hill, the union's general secretary, and only remained in the post after Vic Feather personally persuaded him that he would find Dix a more senior position once Hill retired.  With this backing, and that of Alan Fisher, who succeeded Hill, Dix was able to create a shop steward system in the union, and developing a novel strategy of rolling industrial action."]}, {"page": "Gilly Szego", "response": ["In 1970 she was commissioned by Vic Feather to produce an exhibition at Congress House, the headquarters of the Trades Union Congress, in London, where she showed Propellers."]}, {"page": "Bert Papworth", "response": ["During World War II, Papworth was readmitted to the TGWU, and he again served on the executive committee of the TGWU from 1941.
