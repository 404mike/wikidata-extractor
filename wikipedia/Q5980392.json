He helped define the sound of the Chicago post-punk music scene in the 1980s and early 1990s. Burgess worked with a number of key underground bands including: Big Black, Naked Raygun, The Effigies, Get Smart!, Ministry, Green, Bloodsport, Pegboy, Poster Children, and Bhopal Stiffs.Burgess was a native of Weymouth, Dorset, England. \nHis  \"Chicago sound\" was described by the Chicago Tribune as: \"built on no-nonsense elements: powerhouse drumming, prominent bass lines, and bold guitars that split the difference between anthemic and anarchic.\" The Chicago Sun-Times described it as: \"a massive, crunching, live-and-in-your-face sound\". It was a sound that influenced Burgess' friend and student Steve Albini.\nBurgess also worked with the Defoliants, Heavy Manners, the Cows, the Didjits, Breaking Circus, Jawbox, Heliogabale, Daria, Les Vilains Clowns, Papier Tigre and many others.Burgess moved to Europe in the early 1990s and worked at Black Box (his own recording studio in rural France.)Burgess died in France on 11 February 2010 of a pulmonary embolism-- a complication of pancreatic and liver cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ministry (band)", "response": ["The first line-up of Ministry consisted of keyboardists Robert Roberts and John Davis, bassist Sorenson, and drummer Stephen George; Jourgensen auditioned several singers, all of whom were unsatisfactory, so he decided to perform vocals himself.

The record was co-produced by Jay O'Roarke and Iain Burgess and released in late 1981 on Wax Trax! in the US.

Underneath the fun and fury, the band displayed a real feel for classic rock forms from Jerry Lee Lewis (spoofed and honored in the opening cut \"Jerry Lee\") to Ramones to AC/DC and others.

They also hinted at another growing division in the band. As Burgess put it, \"they got a lot of heat for the change in musical direction to some degree on the latter two albums that I worked on, Ink and Fly on a Wire. I think both of which have some really f*****g good songs on them, and some are, well, in my opinion, just not all that marvelous. I think John (Kezdy) would say the same thing.
