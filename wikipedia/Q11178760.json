At the age of 15, he moved to Guangzhou to continue his studies and remained there until the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, returning to Hong Kong that year to join the Kowloon Motor Bus as a conductor. In 1966, he was promoted to operations officer of the Kwun Tong Depot, established to open up new routes to the new satellite town then dominated by mini-buses. His role required he make contact with kaifong associations, the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs, the Social Welfare Department and the police and thus he got to know many government officials, including Denis Bray who later became the Secretary for Home Affairs. He was asked for advice on the transportation issues in Kwun Tong and was invited to see Governor Sir Murray MacLehose. He also became the public relations manager for Kowloon Motor Bus."]}, {"page": "Denis Campbell Bray", "response": ["#REDIRECT Denis Bray"]}, {"page": "Denis Bray (civil servant)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Denis Bray"]}]}}
