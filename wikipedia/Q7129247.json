Her style and dress sense\u2014a bleached platinum-blonde bouffant hairdo with dark raccoon-like eye make-up\u2014made her a highly visible icon of the London punk subculture. Along with Johnny Rotten, Soo Catwoman and Siouxsie Sioux, she is credited with creating the W10 London punk look. \nShe took the single name Jordan at age 14 in Seaford. When Jordan first walked into 430 King's Road, London, wearing gold stilettos, a see-through net skirt, with a white bouffant hairstyle, it had just changed to SEX, \"but there wasn't a position at the time so I got a job in Harrods, on the third floor in a place called Way In. ... A few weeks later I then got a call from Michael [Collins, the manager] asking if I could come in... Malcolm [Maclaren] had been in New York with The New York Dolls when I was hired\".Rooke commuted for two hours each day to London from Seaford, East Sussex, on the south coast. She recalled that her punk image caused problems for her:\n\nI commuted for about two years.  I had some real bad dos on the train.  I had tourists trying to pay me for my photo\u2026worse than that, mothers saying that I'm upsetting their children and debauching them and how dare I get on a train looking like that.  Somebody tried to throw me off the train one day, literally out the door, so British Rail told me to go sit in first class, get out of trouble.\nIn the late 1970s, she served as an early manager for Adam and the Ants. She recorded the track \"Lou\" (about Lou Reed) as a guest lead vocalist with the band for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel's Peel Sessions and often performed the song live with them from mid-1977 up to May 1978 when she left the band. In the 1980s, she managed the band Wide Boy Awake, in which her then-husband Kevin Mooney was a guitarist. Mooney had previously been a bassist of Adam and the Ants.She made a cameo appearance in Derek Jarman's debut film Sebastiane, and played the lead role in his follow-up film Jubilee as the punk \"anti-historian\" Amyl Nitrate (named after the drug amyl nitrite). She can also be seen in Julien Temple's The Great Rock and Roll Swindle wearing an \"Only anarchists are pretty\" t-shirt and appearing on stage with the Sex Pistols during their first live television performance of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" in August 1976.\nIn 1984, after divorcing Mooney, she returned to Seaford, now breeding Burmese cats and working as a veterinary nurse. Rooke's autobiography, published by Omnibus Press: Defying Gravity: Jordan's Story with Cathi Unsworth was published in 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sex (boutique)", "response": ["SEX sold fetish and bondage wear supplied by existing specialist labels such as Atomage, She-And-Me and London Leatherman as well as designs by McLaren and Westwood. Jordan (Pamela Rooke) was a sales assistant. Among customers at SEX were the four original members of Sex Pistols (the bass-player Glen Matlock was an employee as a sales assistant on Saturdays). The group's name was provided by McLaren in partial promotion of the boutique. In August 1975, nineteen-year-old John Lydon was persuaded to audition for the group by singing along to Alice Cooper's \"I'm Eighteen\" on the jukebox. Other notable patrons included occasional assistant Chrissie Hynde, Adam Ant, Marco Pirroni, Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin and the rest of the Bromley Contingent.", "Many people related with the punk scene worked at the shop in one way or another. A notable employee was Jordan (Pamela Rooke), whose provocative dress sense served as a walking advertisement for the shop.

The series is being executively produced and directed by Danny Boyle. Jordan was the archetypal subversive model whose 'distinctive Vivienne Westwood-designed outfits' and 'outrageous make-up' made her the original face of punk, and was co-credited with creating the punk rock fashion style (e.g. ripped fishnets, dominatrix heels and raccoon-like eye make-up).", "| Jordan (Pamela Rooke) "]}, {"page": "Jordan (name)", "response": ["*Pamela Rooke (born 1955), British punk rock fashion model and actress known as Jordan"]}, {"page": "Kevin Mooney", "response": ["Mooney began his musical career in 1977 with Anglo-Irish punk band The European Cowards, in collaboration with John Keogh and rebel rouser John Herlihy.

After leaving the band because of personal conflict and creative differences, he formed the band Wide Boy Awake with best friend John Keogh, Harley Price and Horace Carter Allan. Wide Boy Awake released two EPs in the UK, including songs \"Chicken Outlaw\", \"Billy Hyena\", \"Bona Venture\" and \"Slang Teacher\", some of which appear on 1980s various-artists compilations. The band were managed by Mooney's then-wife Pamela Rooke. \"Billy Hyena\" was accompanied by a music video directed by Derek Jarman. Wide Boy Awake disbanded soon after without releasing a full album.
