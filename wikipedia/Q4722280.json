He was the father of Stanley Baldwin, the Conservative Prime Minister.\nBaldwin was the 12th and posthumously-born child of George Pearce Baldwin and Sarah Chalkley Stanley.  He started work at the Wilden Iron and Tin Plate Company at Wilden (near Stourport, Worcestershire), which, in 1840, had been taken over by his uncle Enoch Baldwin, who ran the business with his nephews, Pearce and William, trading as E.P.& W. Baldwin of Wilden.  In 1879, Alfred and his brothers dissolved the partnership. Alfred then moved into Wilden House and took over the Wilden Works, changing the name of the business to Baldwins Ltd.\nAs well as being an ironmaster, Alfred also became a director and chairman of the Great Western Railway.\nAt the 1892 general election, Baldwin was elected as MP for Bewdley in Worcestershire, holding the seat until his death, when he was succeeded by his only child, Stanley Baldwin, who later became prime minister of the United Kingdom.\nOther public offices held by Alfred Baldwin were those of Justice of the Peace (JP) for Staffordshire, JP for Worcestershire and Deputy Lieutenant of Worcestershire.\nHe married Louisa Macdonald, daughter of Reverend George Browne Macdonald, a Wesleyan minister, and Hannah Jones, on 9 August 1866. \nThrough his wife, Baldwin was connected to three famous English artists and an even more famous writer. The eldest sister, Alice, married the art teacher John Kipling in 1865; they became engaged at Rudyard Lake, near Leek in Staffordshire\u2014hence, the name of their son, the writer Rudyard. In a joint wedding with her, her sister Agnes married the painter Sir Edward John Poynter. \nAnother sister, Georgiana, married the painter Edward Coley Burne-Jones in 1860.\nAlfred Baldwin paid for the construction of All Saints Church, Wilden, which was consecrated in 1880.   The original windows were replaced with 14 designs by Burne-Jones between 1902 and 1914. They are mostly dedicated to members of the MacDonald, Baldwin and Burne-Jones families; one shows Stanley Baldwin setting out on life's journey accompanied by a guardian angel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Burne-Jones", "response": ["In 1856 Burne-Jones became engaged to Georgiana \"Georgie\" MacDonald (1840\u20131920), one of the MacDonald sisters. She was training to be a painter, and was the sister of Burne-Jones's old school friend. The couple married in 1860, after which she made her own work in woodcuts, and became a close friend of George Eliot. (Another MacDonald sister married the artist Sir Edward Poynter, a further sister married the ironmaster Alfred Baldwin and was the mother of the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and yet another sister was the mother of Rudyard Kipling. Kipling and Baldwin were thus Burne-Jones's nephews by marriage).", "In 1871 Morris & Co. were responsible for the windows at All Saints, designed by Burne-Jones for Alfred Baldwin, his wife's brother-in-law. The firm was reorganised as Morris & Co. in 1875, and Burne-Jones continued to contribute designs for stained glass, and later tapestries until the end of his career. Nine windows designed by him and made by Morris & Co were installed in Holy Trinity Church in Frome.

Alfred and Louisa were the parents of Stanley Baldwin who was UK prime minister on three occasions. After his birth, Louisa seemed unhappy with her life in Worcestershire where her husband was an ironmaster. She had at least one miscarriage and spent time in a bath chair, and days alone in darkness. Later commentators have noted that she would recover when on holiday, and have proposed that her illness was a form of hypochondria. During the 1870s the couple travelled to find a cure, and she tried a wide variety of medicines. She recovered in 1883 and took a leading role in her local village of Wilden, near Stourport. In 1886 she published \"A Martyr to Mammon\" and in 1889, \"The Story of a Marriage\". She commissioned remarkable stained glass windows for Wilden church from Edward Burne-Jones. Her recovery did not outlast her husband's election to Parliament in 1902, and her condition was made worse by his death in 1908.", "Louise was in time the grandmother to Oliver and Arthur Baldwin, respectively the second and third Earls Baldwin of Bewdley.

The first was a biography of his father, written as a result of his strong feeling that the official biography by G. M. Young did not do Stanley Baldwin justice. Baldwin strongly criticised not only Young, but other historians, including John Wheeler-Bennett, D. C. Somervell and Sir Lewis Namier for, in his view, misjudging the former prime minister.\"Mr. Baldwin Cross-Examines His Guilty Men\", The Times, 19 January 1956, p. 11  His second book, The Macdonald Sisters was a study of the four daughters of the Rev G. B. Macdonald: Alice married Rudyard Kipling's father; Georgiana married Edward Burne-Jones; Agnes married Edward Poynter; and Louisa married Alfred Baldwin, Windham's paternal grandfather.
