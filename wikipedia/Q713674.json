The Museum's Director Richard Owen provided advice on animals living and extinct that Waterhouse could use in the decoration.Cunningham, 2001, p. 50 The Waterhouse drawings for all the terracotta decoration in and on the building were converted to three dimensional clay models by a Frenchman by the name of M. Du Jardin, who worked as a foreman for Farmer and Brindley, who also carved and installed the marble window sills in the Museum. These clay models were then used to make moulds from Plaster-of-Paris, these moulds were then used to create the actual terracotta sculptures by Gibbs & Canning, the same sculpture is often used multiple times to decorate the Museum. The east wing of the museum has terracotta sculptures of extinct creatures, the central block and west wing of living species.Cunningham, 2001, p. 70 The ceilings of the Main Hall and of the North Hall are decorated with paintings of plants. It is likely that the Museum's Keeper of Botany William Carruthers provided guidance and plant specimens for Waterhouse to base his designs on. The plants that decorate the Main Hall are from right across the Globe, the North Hall is decorated with paintings of native British plants. The Waterhouse drawings were converted into full size paintings by the Manchester firm of Best & Lea.Knapp & Press, pp. 18-20 The decorative ceramic tile-work was manufactured by W.B. Simpson & Sons Ltd. The simple stained glass was executed by F.T. Odell, designed by Waterhouse in his preferred light colours, its is either geometrical or based on a botanical theme. The decorative ironwork, for example the cresting on the roofs and the railings around the Museum, was executed by Hart, Son, Peard and Co.."]}, {"page": "Bennettitales", "response": ["The Cycadeoideaceae (originally \u201cCycadeoideae\u201d) were named by English geologist William Buckland in 1828, from fossil trunks found in Jurassic strata on the Isle of Portland, England, which Buckland gave the genus name Cycadeoidea. Buckland provided a description of the family and two species, but failed to give a description of the genus, which has led to Buckland's description of the family being considered invalid by modern taxonomic standards. In publications in 1870, Scottish botanist William Carruthers and English paleobotanist William Crawford Williamson described the first known reproductive organs of the Bennettitales from Jurassic strata of Yorkshire and Jurassic-Cretaceous strata of the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Portland. Caruthers was the first to recognise that Bennettitales had distinct differences from cycads, and established the tribes \"Williamsonieae\" and \"Bennettiteae\", with the latter being named after the genus Bennettites named by Caruthers in the same publication, the name being in honour of British botanist John Joseph Bennett. The order Bennettitales was erected German botanist Adolf Engler in 1892, who recognised the group as separate from the Cycadales.Engler, H.G.A. 1892. Syllabus der Vorlesungen \u00fcber specielle und medicinisch-pharmaceutische Botanik. xxiii + 184 pp. Gebr. Borntraeger, Berlin The Anthophyte hypothesis erected by Arber and Parking in 1907 posited that angiosperms arose from Bennettitales, as suggested by the wood-like structures and rudimentary flowers. Based on morphological data, however, Bennettitales were classified as a monophyletic group when paired with Gnetales. a study in 2006 suggested that Bennettitales, Angiosperms, and Gigantopteridales form a clade based on the presence of oleanane. A 2007 study examining phase-contrast X-ray images of gymnosperm seeds suggested that the supported the Anthophyte hypothesis. Evidence from seed coats suggest that Bennettitales form a clade with the gymnosperm orders of Gnetales and Erdtmanithecales. Molecular evidence has consistently contradicted the Anthophyte hypothesis, finding that Angiosperms are the sister group to all living gymnosperms, including Gnetales. A 2017 phylogeny based on molecular signatures of fossilised cuticles found that Bennettitales were more closely related to the Ginkgo+Cycads clade than conifers, and were closely related to Nilssonia and Ptilozamites."]}, {"page": "Carruthers", "response": ["*William Carruthers (1830\u20131922), British botanist "]}, {"page": "Williamsonia (plant)", "response": ["Williamsonia was originally described as Zamia gigas by William Crawford Williamson.

This concept was not disputed until 1872, when the rival scientist William Carruthers poured ridicule on the idea. Such was his fervour that he rebuked the name Prototaxites (loosely translated as \"first yew\"The \"Taxinaea\" (Taxaceae) are the grouping of conifers to which Dawson drew analogy) and insisted that the name Nematophycus (\"stringy alga\") be adopted, a move strongly against scientific convention. Dawson fought adamantly to defend his original interpretation until studies of the microstructure made it clear that his position was untenable, whence he promptly attempted to rename the genus himself (to Nematophyton, \"stringy plant\"), denying with great vehemence that he'd ever considered it to be a tree. Despite these political attempts to rename the genus, the rules of botanical nomenclature mean that the name \"Prototaxites\", however inappropriate in meaning, remains in use today."]}, {"page": "Moffat", "response": ["* William Carruthers, botanist."]}, {"page": "Carruth.", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Carruthers (botanist)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| William Carruthers||08/06/1871||29 May 1830 \u2013 2 June 1922"]}, {"page": "Botanical Society of Scotland", "response": ["* William Carruthers"]}, {"page": "Keeper of Botany, Natural History Museum", "response": ["*William Carruthers 1871\u20131895"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (C)", "response": ["* Carruth. \u2013 William Carruthers (1830\u20131922)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of pterosaur research", "response": ["* William Carruthers described two new oospecies of Oolithes and suggested that these fossil eggs were laid by pterosaurs."]}, {"page": "Thomas Field Gibson", "response": ["Gibson was in addition \"a patron of geology\", being elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1847 and serving on its Council.

To create the painted panels from the initial cartoons, Waterhouse commissioned Manchester artist Charles James Lea of Best & Lea, with whom he had already worked on Pilmore Hall in Hurworth-on-Tees. Waterhouse provided Lea with a selection of botanical drawings, and requested that Lea \"select and prepare drawings of fruits and flowers most suitable and gild same in the upper panels of the roof\"; it is not recorded who drew the cartoons for the paintings, or how the species were chosen.
