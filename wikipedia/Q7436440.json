With less money at his disposal than his predecessor Garry Hill, Still began overhauling the squad, signing players from further down the league pyramid such as Craig Mackail-Smith, Shane Blackett, Scott Griffiths and Glen Southam, while allowing 15 players to leave.

Still continued building his squad, signing Carshalton Athletic winger Sam Saunders and White Ensign striker Paul Benson, who was playing in the Essex Olympian League \u2013 the eleventh tier of English football. In October 2005, Still was offered the manager's job at Bristol Rovers, but rejected it stating that he was \"very settled\" at Dagenham. The club struggled for consistency through 2005\u201306, finishing the season in tenth, albeit with fewer points than in 2004\u201305.
