The two deaths seemed to have caused Mann to have a nervous breakdown, but it has been said that during this period she produced some of her best work, from landscapes and child portraits to sculpture and abstract paintings. She befriended the artist Matthew Smith and was influenced by his work. As a result, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography opines that her best work occurred during the last ten years of her life. During this period she experimented with abstract art, drawings of nude models and sculpture."]}, {"page": "Olga Edwardes", "response": ["She had been trained in painting, and returned to that art form following her acting career.

Davenport was not merely an accomplished artist, or a collector; but her deep friendships with British artists from the 1950s onwards place Davenport as a key and perhaps surprisingly influential figure in the British art scene of the time. In St Ives, Davenport was to meet and befriend some of the greatest British artists of the 20th century and during her life she acquired important paintings for her own collection, including works by Patrick Heron, Roger Hilton, Terry Frost, and William Scott.
