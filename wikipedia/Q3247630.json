In support of his study, Harris spent most of his lunch hours at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, London. In his third year at the Academy Harris was elected to the Livery in the Guild of Painter-Stainers and awarded the Freedom of the City of London becoming their youngest member at the time. Harris wrote and presented a paper for the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers entitled: \u2018The Necessity of Traditional Art\u2019. This speech was subsequently incorporated into the curriculum of \u2013 The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The late Peter Greenham RA, Former Keeper of the Royal Academy once said about Harris \"Anyone wishing to pursue Traditional Art will find himself swimming against a stream of insensitive Modernism.\" This is also reflected in an article in The Scotsman.", "In 1989 four years after finishing at the Royal Academy, Harris was awarded a Senior Academic Cultural Exchange Visit to Russia. Harris had to study Russian for 18 months to be able to qualify for this Award. He represented Great Britain visiting Moscow, St. Petersburg, Pavlosk and the Baltic Coast with a speaking engagement at the Repin Institute of Arts in St. Petersburg. Harris co-founded the \u2018New Human Realists for New Traditional Art\u2019 with Prof. David Morris, former Royal Academy Art Historian. They staged a huge exhibition of artworks, entitled \u2018Artists For Peace\u2019 Exhibition in Picadilly, London."]}]}}
