He went on to make 159 league appearances with the Lancashire club, and scored 19 goals before leaving to join Queens Park Rangers for a single season in 1977. He began a nine-year spell in the West Country in 1978, spending three years with Swindon Town, four years with Bristol Rovers, and two with Bristol City, becoming one of the few players to represent both sides in Bristol derbies in the process. His transfer from Swindon to Bristol Rovers was a swap deal, with midfielder Gary Emmanuel moving in the opposite direction. Whilst at Swindon Brian was fondly known as \"Animal\".\nHis final League club was Shrewsbury Town, who he represented between 1987 and 1991. He then joined non-League side Alvechurch, just two years before they folded in 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Williams (disambiguation)", "response": ["Brian Williams (born 1959) is an American journalist.", "Brian Williams may also refer to:", "*Brian Williams (sportscaster) (born 1946), Canadian sportscaster", "*Brian Williams (linebacker) (born 1972), former American football linebacker", "*Brian Williams (cornerback) (born 1979), American football cornerback", "*Brian Williams (center) (born 1966), former American football center", "*Brian Williams (basketball) or Bison Dele (1969\u20132002), American basketball player", "*Brian Williams (baseball) (born 1969), former American baseball pitcher", "*Brian Williams (rugby union) (1962\u20132007), former Welsh rugby player", "*Brian Williams (footballer, born 1955), English former footballer", "*Brian Williams (footballer, born 1961), Trinidadian football coach and football player", "*Brian Williams (Australian footballer) (1936\u20132010), Australian rules footballer", "*Brian Williams (director), Irish-born London-based designer turned creative advertising director", "*Brian Williams (illustrator) (1956\u20132010), illustrator of the later Lone Wolf gamebooks", "*Brian Williams (Missouri politician), member of the Missouri Senate", "*Brian Williams (Ohio politician) (born 1942), former member of the US state of Ohio's House of Representatives", "*Brian Williams (surgeon) (born 1969), American surgeon", "*Lustmord (Brian Williams), experimental musician", "*Brian Williams, father of fictional character Rory Williams in the television series Doctor Who", "*Smash Williams (Brian Williams), a fictional character in the television series Friday Night Lights"]}, {"page": "List of Swindon Town F.C. players", "response": ["|Brian Williams ||||MF||1978\u201381 ||122||10"]}, {"page": "Bristol derby", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Brian Williams||style=\"text-align:left;\"|||1985\u20131987||77||3||1981\u20131985||172||21"]}, {"page": "1986 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["| || ||Brian Williams"]}, {"page": "1987 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["||DF ||3 ||Brian Williams"]}, {"page": "Bristol Rovers F.C.\u2013Swindon Town F.C. rivalry", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Brian Williams||style=\"text-align:left;\"|||1981\u20131985||172||21||1978\u20131981||99||8"]}, {"page": "Bristol Rovers F.C.
