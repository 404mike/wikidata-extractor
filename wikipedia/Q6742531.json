He played first-class cricket for Glamorgan. Nash was a left-arm medium-pace bowler and useful lower-order left-handed batsman. He made his debut for the county in 1966 and was released by the county after the 1983 season. He captained the county in 1980 and 1981. He took the most wickets for Glamorgan in 1969 when it won the county championship. In 1985, he played his last one-day match for Shropshire. Between 1966 and 1983 in his 17 years career, Nash took 993 first-class wickets, scored 7,129 runs and held 148 catches. He died on 30 July 2019 in London at the age of 74 years.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abergavenny", "response": ["* Malcolm Nash (1945\u20132019), cricketer, famous for bowling to Gary Sobers who hit six sixes in one Nash over, was born in Abergavenny."]}, {"page": "Garfield Sobers", "response": ["On 31 August 1968, Sobers became the first batsman ever to hit six sixes in a single over of six consecutive balls in first-class cricket. Sobers hit the first four balls cleanly out of the ground but was caught on his fifth attempt by Roger Davis on the boundary at long-off. However, while doing so, Davis fell on his back and landed on the line. Umpire Eddie Phillipson ruled that Davis had carried the ball over the boundary and signalled six. Sobers then smashed the next ball - the sixth ball of the over - clean over the East Terrace of the St. Helen's Cricket Ground. As commentator Wilf Wooller put it: \"And he\u2019s done it! He\u2019s done it! And my goodness, it\u2019s gone ... way down to Swansea!\" Sobers was playing as captain of Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at St. Helen's in Swansea; the unfortunate bowler was Malcolm Nash. This tally of 36 runs in an over broke a 57-year-old record of 34 runs, held by Ted Alletson. The ball was collected from a garden by 11-year-old Richard Lewis; he later gave the ball to Sobers.

So rare in county cricket was it, that opposition players out of respect for Barwick coined his deliveries \"Basils\". In 268 List A matches for Glamorgan, he took 312 wickets at an average of 26.68. He took a five wicket haul on 5 occasions, with his best figures of 6/28 coming against Derbyshire in the 1993 AXA Equity & Law League, with it being on the back of these performances that cricket writers began touting for his selection in the England team to play One Day Internationals. The 1993 season was also the same season in which he won his only silverware with Glamorgan, with the county being triumphant in the AXA Equity & Law League. As his career with Glamorgan entered its final years and he found his first-class opportunities limited as the county sought more wicket-taking bowlers in the County Championship, Barwick was still an ever present member of the Glamorgan limited-overs squad. His subtle change of pace and the introduction of off cutters to his bowling greatly benefited his bowling in the early 1990s, with Barwick taking over 20 wickets a season for six consecutive seasons. His best was the 1993 season, in which he took 35 wickets at an average of 21.11. His 312 wickets for the county remain the 3rd most wickets for Glamorgan in List A cricket (behind Malcolm Nash and Robert Croft). It was in this format of the game that his highest score with the bat was to come, a score of 48 not out against Worcestershire in the 1989 Refuge Assurance League.
