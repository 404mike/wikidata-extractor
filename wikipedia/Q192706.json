He passionately rejected both the prevailing Aristotelian philosophy and the Scholastic method of university teaching.  He is remembered today largely for his book De Magnete (1600).\nA unit of magnetomotive force, also known as magnetic potential, was named the Gilbert in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Johannes Kepler", "response": ["In Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of God the Father) was the source of motive force in the Solar System. As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on William Gilbert's theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from De Magnete (1600) and on his own work on optics. Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive species)On motive species, see Lindberg, \"The Genesis of Kepler's Theory of Light,\" pp.\u00a038\u201340. radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it.Koyr\u00e9, The Astronomical Revolution, pp.\u00a0199\u2013202. Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order. Based on measurements of the aphelion and perihelion of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: planets sweep out equal areas in equal times\u2014his second law of planetary motion.Caspar, Kepler, pp.\u00a0129\u2013132"]}, {"page": "Scientific Revolution", "response": ["Despite his influence on scientific methodology, he himself rejected correct novel theories such as William Gilbert's magnetism, Copernicus's heliocentrism, and Kepler's  laws of planetary motion.", "William Gilbert was an early advocate of this method. He passionately rejected both the prevailing Aristotelian philosophy and the Scholastic method of university teaching.  His book De Magnete was written in 1600, and he is regarded by some as the father of electricity and magnetism.Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, 2000, CD-ROM, version 2.5. In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the terrella. From these experiments, he concluded that the Earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses point north.", "Dr. William Gilbert, in De Magnete, invented the New Latin word electricus from  (elektron), the Greek word for \"amber\". Gilbert undertook a number of careful electrical experiments, in the course of which he discovered that many substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc.,Priestley, Joseph (1757) History of Electricity. London were capable of manifesting electrical properties. Gilbert also discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the electrification of all bodies, due to the now well-known fact that moisture impaired the insulation of such bodies.  He also noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet only attracted iron. The many discoveries of this nature earned for Gilbert the title of founder of the electrical science.Maver, William, Jr.: \"Electricity, its History and Progress\", The Encyclopedia Americana; a library of universal knowledge, vol. X, pp.\u00a0172ff. (1918). New York: Encyclopedia Americana Corp. By investigating the forces on a light metallic needle, balanced on a point, he extended the list of electric bodies, and found also that many substances, including metals and natural magnets, showed no attractive forces when rubbed. He noticed that dry weather with north or east wind was the most favourable atmospheric condition for exhibiting electric phenomena\u2014an observation liable to misconception until the difference between conductor and insulator was understood.Dampier, W.C.D.
