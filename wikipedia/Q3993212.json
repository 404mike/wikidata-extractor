His moment of fame came on 8 May 1999, in the final match of the 1998\u201399 Third Division season against Plymouth Argyle, which Carlisle needed to win to avoid relegation. With the score 1\u20131 with only ten seconds remaining, and Carlisle winning a corner, Glass came up from his own penalty area and promptly scored a last minute goal, volleying the ball in after the Plymouth goalkeeper had parried out Scott Dobie's goalbound header. Carlisle got the win they needed and Scarborough were relegated to the Football Conference instead after a 1\u20131 draw with Peterborough. Scarborough's match had already finished before Glass scored, and their fans had already been celebrating on the pitch at the McCain Stadium."]}, {"page": "List of foreign MLS players", "response": ["*Tony Caig \u2013 Houston \u2013 2008"]}, {"page": "Josh Wicks", "response": ["Wicks re-signed for the Caps in 2006 and served as backup to Tony Caig.

It was here that he caught the attention of then Newcastle United manager Ruud Gullit, who signed him for an undisclosed fee (thought to be in the region of \u00a3800,000) in August 1999. His time at Newcastle was largely unsuccessful, as he endured a terrible start to his career at the club, losing 4-2 to Southampton on his debut. He found his first team opportunities very limited after this, not helped by the competition for his position being very high with the reliable Shay Given and Steve Harper also at the club. Tony Caig was also ahead of him as third choice backup. He did, however, manage to keep a clean sheet against Arsenal at Highbury, in what proved to be his third and final game for the club."]}, {"page": "Davie Irons", "response": ["After a short term job as a coach with Northern Football League club Celtic Nation, Irons departed the club to rejoin the Brunton Park club as the full-time youth team manager in July 2013, after the departure of former coach Eric Kinder to Blackburn Rovers.
