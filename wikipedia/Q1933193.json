In 1972, Harrison told music journalist Mike Hennessey that the Robinson and Cocker versions were among his favourites. In later interviews, he said that the best cover version was a recording by James Brown, in which the singer declares \"I got to believe in something!\" over the main riff. Harrison commented that the recording was relatively obscure in Brown's catalogue: \"It was one of his B-sides. I have it on my jukebox at home.

Schaffner paired \"Beware of Darkness\" with \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"the two most eloquent songs on the album, musically as well as lyrically\" with \"mysterious, seductive melodies, over which faded strings ... hover like Blue Jay Way fog\".

The latter was an unprecedented appointment for pop stars at the time and a reflection of British politicians' recognition of the Beatles' influence and mass appeal.
