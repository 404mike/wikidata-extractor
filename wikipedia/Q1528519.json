He was elected for the UK Independence Party in the European elections of 2004 and 2009, representing UKIP until September 2013, when UKIP withdrew the party whip from him. He then sat as an Independent until the end of his term of office in May 2014. Bloom subsequently resigned his UKIP party membership on 13 October 2014.During his tenure, he received attention for making remarks considered objectionable by his party leader, for his opinions concerning climate change and for making other controversial comments. On 20 September 2013, UKIP withdrew the party whip from Bloom after he hit journalist Michael Crick in the street with a conference brochure, threatened a second reporter, and at the party's conference jokingly referred to his female audience as sluts. Bloom resigned his party whip from UKIP on 24 September 2013 and thereafter sat as an Independent MEP until the end of his term in office on 2 July 2014. Nigel Farage, the UKIP party leader, has been cited by Channel 4 News to say that \"the trouble with Godfrey is that, he is not a racist, he's not an extremist or any of those things and he's not even anti-women, but he has a sort-of-rather old fashioned territorial army sense of humour which does not translate very well in modern Britain\".Bloom was removed as Honorary President of the Ludwig von Mises Centre in December 2017, the organisation citing his comments on Twitter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alessandra Mussolini", "response": ["In response to a comment made by UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom in which he said that \"No self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age.

Among the examples of UKIP representatives and supporters embarrassing the party have been an MEP who called for a ban on the construction of mosques and for all British Muslims to sign a code of conduct, a councillor who suggested that shops should be allowed to refuse service to women and homosexuals, and a council candidate who compared Islam to Nazism and told black comedian Lenny Henry to leave Britain after the latter called for greater ethnic diversity within the UK's creative industries. In 2015, a documentary called Meet the Ukippers filmed activists making racist statements; one said \"the only people I do have a problem with are negroes\". For many years such individuals were internally tolerated within the party, although as part of Farage's push to professionalise the party a number of its members, such as MEP Godfrey Bloom, were expelled for making comments that brought UKIP into disrepute. In 2018, Jo Marney\u2014who was then the girlfriend of the party leader Henry Bolton\u2014was suspended from UKIP after it was revealed that she had sent texts stating that black Africans were \"ugly\". In these messages, she had criticised Meghan Markle for marrying into the British royal family, stating that Markle was \"a dumb little commoner\" and \"a black American.

Bloom later stated that he was referring to the fact that the indoctrination of the German people under the Nazi regime has long-lasting effects; \"some Germans still find it difficult to accept diversity in Europe and differences of opinion\". In the debate on the future of the Euro Stability Pact Schulz had criticised the role played by the United Kingdom, which was involved in the discussions despite not being a member of the eurozone, and said that some eurosceptics would take pleasure in the collapse of the European Union. Following the incident, the President of Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, excluded Bloom from the Chamber. The Dutch MEP Barry Madlener, from the right-wing populist Partij voor de Vrijheid (PVV \u2013 Freedom Party), then protested against that decision, on the grounds that Schulz himself had recently described the PVV MEP Dani\u00ebl van der Stoep as a fascist, but had not been excluded from the Chamber."]}, {"page": "List of Old Olavians", "response": ["* Godfrey Bloom, UKIP MEP from 2004-2014 for Yorkshire and the Humber"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| colspan = 5 | Godfrey BloomUKIP (2004\u20132013) Independent (2013\u20132014)"]}, {"page": "European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality", "response": ["*Godfrey Bloom\t "]}, {"page": "Mumsnet", "response": ["The site has hosted webchats with celebrities and politicians.
