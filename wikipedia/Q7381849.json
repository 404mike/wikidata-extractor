He was the fifth highest runscorer behind Harry Jupp, Tom Hearne, Charles Buller and Russell Walker; and second in the batting averages behind Robert Carpenter. He was a creditable 15th in the list of wicket-takers, having bowled many less deliveries than all of those above him except James Southerton. Grace took 31 wickets from 1,269 deliveries compared with the overall leader George Wootton who took 119 wickets from 4,712 deliveries, though Wootton had a more economical average."]}, {"page": "R.
