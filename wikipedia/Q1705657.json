In a match against Burnley on 13 September 2014, he saved a penalty from Scott Arfield, as the club drew 0\u20130. After the match, his performance was praised by the returning manager Neil Warnock, saying: \"I think they broke the mould with him. Speroni is just a one-off but he does that every week and that's why he's been here so long with us. Speroni is a gem of a person.\" During a 2\u20132 draw against West Bromwich Albion on 25 October 2014.

However, Speroni uncharacteristically had an inconsistent season could be due to a lack of rotation and even a sense of being too comfortable in the number one spot. Despite being dropped to the substitute bench for the last two remaining matches of the 2014\u201315 season, he went on to make thirty\u2013seven appearances in all competitions.
