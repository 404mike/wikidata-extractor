He was born in Dewsbury and died in Harrogate. Nicholson was awarded his county cap after the 1963 season and a benefit for him in 1973 raised \u00a313,214. He made 283 first-class appearances and 120 in limited overs cricket, taking 879 and 173 wickets respectively. Prior to joining Yorkshire, Nicholson was a policeman in Southern Rhodesia.Nicholson's best seasons were 1966 and 1967 when, usually opening the bowling with Fred Trueman, he took over 100 wickets and played a key role in Yorkshire's title wins. Despite his successful county career, he never played Test cricket. He was selected for the England tour of South Africa in 1964\u201365 but was forced to withdraw because of an injury. His later career was dogged by ill health, caused by blood clots in his leg, which contributed to his early death.Although he never managed international recognition, Nicholson was highly rated by the Yorkshire public. The county's Players Association holds a Tony Nicholson Memorial Trophy in his honour. At a time when retirement tended to be greeted with muted thanks by the Yorkshire committee, Nicholson was paid the warmest possible tribute.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Yorkshire retained the County Championship title in 1963. Tony Nicholson reinforced Yorkshire's faster bowling and provided Trueman with an able accomplice. In addition, Yorkshire's batting was considerably enhanced by the emergence of Geoff Boycott and John Hampshire. Trueman took 76 wickets in the Championship, 34 in Tests and 129 in all matches. By this time firmly in the category of senior cricketers, Trueman was well aware of his position and its implied privileges but realised that both his energies and his resolve had to be nurtured.Kilburn, p. 168. He captured five wickets in each innings when Yorkshire defeated West Indies at Acklam Park, eight for 45 against Gloucestershire at Bradford and, for England, had a match return of 12 for 119 at Edgbaston.Kilburn, p. 169. He scored two centuries, the first of his career, one against Northamptonshire which Kilburn described as \"timely in the context of the match\" and the other at the Scarborough Festival where he hit six sixes and 11 fours in 67 minutes."]}, {"page": "Nicholson (name)", "response": ["* Tony Nicholson (1938\u20131985), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of male professional bodybuilders", "response": ["* Tony Nicholson"]}, {"page": "List of Yorkshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Tony Nicholson (1962\u20131975) : A.
