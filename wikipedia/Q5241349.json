He was best known for his short stint as a member of the English new wave band ABC in the 1980s. He was featured in several music videos from the band's How to Be a ... Zillionaire! album, including \"Be Near Me\" (1985).\nYarritu's only credited role in the production of How to Be a ... Zillionaire! was providing spoken passages on some tracks. He and Eden (Fiona Russell Powell) were hired for ABC's Zillionaire! era mainly for their unconventional look onstage and in videos. In Yarritu's case, it was his short stature, shaven head, oversized eyeglasses, and diminutive build. He was the lone American in the band.\nToday Yarritu works as a freelance photographer, and is based in New York City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "ABC (band)", "response": ["Singleton left the band shortly after the release of Beauty Stab as a result of Fry and White's reluctance to spend much time touring the band's material.

The band's chart success dwindled further in the UK with this album, but they did score their first US Top 10 hit with \"Be Near Me\", which also made the UK Top 30. The album also featured the singles \"(How to Be a) Millionaire\", \"Vanity Kills\" and \"Ocean Blue\".
