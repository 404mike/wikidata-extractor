Finally McClure and his crew\u2014who were by that time dying of starvation\u2014were found by searchers who had travelled by sledge over the ice from a ship of Sir Edward Belcher's expedition. They rescued McClure and his crew, returning with them to Belcher's ships, which had entered the Sound from the east. McClure and his crew returned to England in 1854 on one of Belcher's ships. They were the first people known to circumnavigate the Americas and to discover and transit the Northwest Passage, albeit by ship and by sledge over the ice. (Both McClure and his ship were found by a party from HMS Resolute, one of Belcher's ships, so his sledge journey was relatively short. HMS Resolute had to be abandoned in the ice on that journey. It was later found again and became quite famous.)"]}, {"page": "1799", "response": ["* February 27 \u2013 Edward Belcher, British admiral (d. 1877)"]}, {"page": "Belcher Islands", "response": ["Before 1914, English-speaking cartographers knew very little about the Belcher Islands, which they showed on maps as specks, much smaller than their true extent.
