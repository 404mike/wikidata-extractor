No one is recorded in public records with the precise name of Seth Davy. This vagueness had led to the assumption that the character was imaginary, although many Liverpudlians claimed to have seen him in person.\nBut Seth Davy certainly existed. Fritz Spiegl possessed a lantern slide clearly showing a poor black street entertainer with three jig dolls at Bevington Bush, surrounded by children. Popular belief is that Seth Davy was West Indian, possibly Jamaican, though Ray Costello in his Black History, a history of Liverpool's black population, says that he was West African. Planters from Devon, England are known to have introduced the surname Davy into Jamaica. The existence of the Davy surname amongst black Jamaicans supports the belief that Seth Davy was from Jamaica. A correspondent to the Liverpool Echo in 1957, claimed he was from Port Antonio in Jamaica.\nDavy sang 'Massa is a stingy man', from the repertoire of Dan Emmett, one of the stars of American minstrelsy, which contains the lines:\"Sing come day, go dayGod send SundayWe'll drink whiskey all de weekAnd buttermilk on Sunday'\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whiskey on a Sunday (song)", "response": ["\"Whiskey on a Sunday\" is a song written by Glyn Hughes (1932\u20131972), which became popular during the second British folk revival. It is sometimes called \"The Ballad of Seth Davy\".", "The song laments the death in 1902 of a performer, Seth Davy, who sang and performed with a set of \"dancing dolls\" outside a public house in Liverpool. The dolls were attached to the end of a plank, and when the plank was struck and vibrated, this caused the dolls to \"dance\". Seth Davy was in fact a Jamaican who performed outside the Bevington Bush Hotel around the turn of the century. It was located just north of Liverpool City Centre."]}]}}
