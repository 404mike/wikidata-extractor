He started the 2016\u201317 season well when he scored the opener and set up the third goal of the game, in a 3\u20131 win over Leeds United in the opening game of the season. However, against Preston North End on 20 August 2016, Onuoha scored an own goal to give the opposition side their second goal, as Queens Park Rangers lost 2\u20130. The following match saw him score his second goal of the season, making amends from his mistake, as the side won 1\u20130 against Wigan Athletic. However, in a 3\u20130 loss against Brighton & Hove Albion on 27 December 2016, Onuoha was sent\u2013off for a professional foul in the 56th minute. After serving a one match suspension, he returned to the first team, coming on as a substitute in the second half, and set up a goal for Pawe\u0142 Wszo\u0142ek, who scored the winning goal, in a 2\u20131 win over Ipswich Town on 2 January 2017. His performance attracted interests from Premier League strugglers Sunderland, but he stayed at the club. Over the season, his performance had been a subject of criticism, due to \"his inability with the ball at his feet\" and leadership. This led some Queens Park Rangers' supporters to call for Onuoha to be dropped from the first team against Rotherham United on 18 March 2017, but he proved them wrong when he scored the third goal of the season in a 5\u20131 win. Onuoha said at the start of the season that the club's objective was to challenge for promotion. But poor results throughout the season saw them finish eighteen place in the league. Despite this, both Onuoha and Grant Hall were praised by new signing Joel Lynch for their improvement in defence throughout the 2016\u201317 season, as well as, \"pushing each other on to greater heights in order to stay in the team.\" Although he missed two matches during the 2016\u201317 season, Onuoha went on to make forty\u2013seven appearances, scoring three times in all competitions. During the season, he was awarded the PFA Community Champion Award."]}, {"page": "Antony Kay", "response": ["Kay signed a new two-year contract in July 2011.

A few days later, Elphick was awarded a two\u2013year contract extension at the club. The day after signing a contract with the club, Elphick made his first league appearance of the season, in a 2\u20131 win over Northampton Town. Elphick's impact in the first team and form earned him praise by Manager Dean Wilkins and formed a partnership throughout the season with Guy Butters and Joel Lynch. From 29 September 2007 to 13 October 2007, Elphick helped the club keep four successive clean sheet in four league matches. In a match against Hartlepool United on 27 October 2007, Elphick was involved in a clash with opposition striker Richie Barker and Barker accused Elphick of \"besmirching the memory of\" Michael Maidens, who died in a car crash weeks ago and following a conclusion to the investigation, he was cleared. However, Elphick suffered a hernia that required a surgery and was sidelined for three weeks, which was soon delayed for another week. Elphick made his return to the first team since returning from injury, in a 3\u20132 win over AFC Bournemouth, in which he stated the game left him bruised and battered. Two weeks later on 19 January 2008, Elphick scored his first professional goal (and his first for the club), in a 1\u20131 draw against Huddersfield Town. Elphick then scored his second goal of the season on 4 March 2008, in a 4\u20132 win over Gillingham. In a match against Nottingham Forest on 24 March 2008, Elphick was given a captaincy armband after their captain Nicky Forster was substituted, which resulted a 0\u20130 draw, in which he said it was honour to wear the captain armband. Then on 11 April 2008, Elphick signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2010. Elphick went on to finish the 2007\u201308 season, making 41 appearances and scoring twice in all competition and was considered to be one of Brighton's best players, winning the 2007\u201308 player of the season award."]}, {"page": "History of Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["In preparation for the 2009\u201310 campaign, Forest signed nine players, five of whom were on loan at the club in the previous season and returned on permanent deals.

Derby and Northampton agreed an undisclosed fee for the out-of-contract player and Jacobs joined Derby on a three-year contract. The club also were rumoured to be interested in Sheffield United right-back Matthew Lowton although the club denied interest in Lowton, who later joined Aston Villa. Wigan Athletic striker Conor Sammon, who the club had missed out on in January 2011, was also a target for the club. Derby also turned down two bids in excess of \u00a31 million in June for defender Jason Shackell, both believed to be from Burnley and two more bids from further Championship clubs, with one thought to be Cardiff City. However the club later accepted a bid for Shackell from Burnley of \u00a31.1 million and he transferred to Burnley, signing a four-year contract with the Clarets. Attention immediately turned to who Derby would sign as a replacement, with out-of-contract Nottingham Forest defender Joel Lynch the first target. The club spoke to Lynch but denied rumours that he had undergone a medical with them and he opted to sign for Huddersfield Town instead. Coventry City centre-half Richard Keogh, already attracting from Leeds United and bids from Bristol City and Cardiff City, which were rejected, was the next defender the club was linked to, Keogh later joined the club on a three-year contract, with striker Callum Ball loaned out to Coventry for the season. Nigel Clough said that although Derby may be outbid for players, they would be able to offer \"the chance to be a part of what we think is a very exciting young side\". At the same time, the club announced that eighteen-year-old former Bolton Wanderers winger James Caton had begun training with them. Other defenders Derby were linked to following Shackell's departure were Bristol city defender James Wilson, Leeds United left-back Aidan White, out-of-contract Dundee United centre-half Garry Kenneth, Cardiff City centre-half Anthony Gerrard and Sunderland centre-half John Egan. Derby offered out-of-contract Crewe Alexandra left-back Kelvin Mellor a three-year contract after Crewe only offered the player a one-year deal, but after extensive talks with Derby Mellor turned down Derby's offer after Crewe offered the player a two-year contract which he signed in July.

The game however was introduced with a minutes silence in respect to those that we have all lost, after a long few weeks which saw the Hillsborough disaster being a major talking point in society and through the media and also due to a Huddersfield Town fan who had died the week previously in the war in Afghanistan. The game then kicked off, and, within the first fifteen minutes of the game, Mark Beevers hit the bar for the Owls, and also James Vaughan of Huddersfield had an optimistic effort hit the bar. However, a controversial penalty was awarded when Jermaine Johnson seemed to foul Jack Hunt in the area. Oliver Norwood saw his penalty saved by Chris Kirkland but scored from the follow-up. Just two minutes later and a diving header from Lee Novak doubled Huddersfield's lead, and saw echoes of last season's encounter at Hillsborough, where Huddersfield were also two-up at this stage. Nearly twenty minutes later and R\u00e9da Johnson headed home to make the score 1\u20132. A minute after the goal, Joel Lynch saw a straight red card, after a challenge on Michail Antonio. With, Wednesday pushing for an equaliser before half-time, the Owls' defender Joe Mattock was sent-off deep in stoppage-time of the first half, with his first yellow card also being debatable. Half-time was then called after an entertaining first half. The second half began quite evenly, however eventually Wednesday started to push with R\u00e9da Johnson and Nejc Pe\u010dnik coming close. However, referee Salisbury was centre of attention again when he awarded Huddersfield Town their second penalty of the match for a Rhys McCabe handball, which replays after the game saw the decision to be harsh and more of a ball-to-hand incident. Adam Clayton stepped up and scored from the spot. R\u00e9da Johnson missed an almost open-net late on and the game finished in a 1\u20133 loss, with a total of seven yellow cards and two reds being handed out. This was Sheffield Wednesday's third defeat on the bounce, their first at home since February (after losing to Stevenage), and their biggest home defeat since March 2011 when they were defeated by Brentford. Later that same week Wednesday were in action again at home, this time against recently relegated Premier League side Bolton Wanderers. Although the Owls started brightly, with Michail Antonio looking the most troublesome player, the game became quite even and a Bolton corner saw Marcos Alonso score with a free-header. Second half was similar to the first with quite an even contest, but the Owls did start to push for the equaliser and deservedly got it when a foul in the box was conceded and loanee Ross Barkley scored from the penalty spot. However, just three minutes later and after a mistake by new-signing and captain Martin Taylor, Mark Davies curled a shot into the top corner of the goal, which saw Bolton Wanderers win the game 1\u20132.
