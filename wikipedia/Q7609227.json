He began a career in instrument repair in 1985 and started making clarinets in 1990. Fox makes modern soprano, basset, and bass clarinets, and basset horns.  In addition he makes t\u00e1rogat\u00f3s, and is one of only a handful of makers of reproduction historical clarinets in the world.  In 2006 he introduced the world's first Bohlen-Pierce clarinets.  Fox clarinets are played by Toronto Symphony Orchestra principal clarinetist Joaquin Valdepenas, Canadian big band leader Don Pierre, klezmer artist Kurt Bjorling of the band Brave Old World, Norwegian clarinetist Terje Lerstad, Binghamton University music professor Timothy Perry, Swiss multi-instrumentalist Peter A. Schmid, and many others in Europe, Japan, the United States, and Canada.  Fox also teaches musical instrument making at the Musikk Instrument Akademiet in Norway. As an instrumentalist, Fox performs and records with the chamber music groups Riverdale Ensemble and Ossia.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bohlen\u2013Pierce scale", "response": ["The BP scale's use of odd integer ratios is appropriate for timbres containing only odd harmonics. Because the clarinet's spectrum (in the chalumeau register) consists of primarily the odd harmonics, and the instrument overblows at the twelfth (or tritave) rather than the octave as most other woodwind instruments do, there is a natural affinity between it and the Bohlen\u2013Pierce scale. In early 2006, clarinet maker Stephen Fox began offering Bohlen\u2013Pierce soprano clarinets for sale. He produced the first BP tenor clarinet (six steps below the soprano) in 2010 and the first epsilon clarinet (four steps above the soprano) in 2011. A contra clarinet (one tritave lower than the soprano) is now (2020) played by Nora Mueller, Luebeck, Germany.", "A first Bohlen\u2013Pierce symposium took place in Boston on March 7 to 9, 2010, produced by composer Georg Hajdu (Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater Hamburg) and the Boston Microtonal Society.

The symposium participants, which included Heinz Bohlen, Max Mathews, Clarence Barlow, Curtis Roads, David Wessel, Psyche Loui, Richard Boulanger, Georg Hajdu, Paul Erlich, Ron Sword, Julia Werntz, Larry Polansky, Manfred Stahnke, Stephen Fox, Elaine Walker, Todd Harrop, Gayle Young, Johannes Kretz, Arturo Grolimund, Kevin Foster, presented 20 papers on history and properties of the Bohlen\u2013Pierce scale, performed more than 40 compositions in the novel system and introduced several new musical instruments.", "* \"Stephen Fox Clarinets\", Bohlen-Pierce clarinets and other instruments, SFoxClarinets.com."]}, {"page": "Basset horn", "response": ["*The small-bore basset horn has a bore diameter in the range of  (still somewhat larger than a soprano clarinet bore, though it is often erroneously thought to be the same; even a large bore English clarinet, such as the old B&H 1010 design has a smaller bore of ).
