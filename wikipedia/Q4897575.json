Playing in five of Somerset's ten matches, she scored 18 runs at an average under four, and her three wickets came at 38.66. Her performances in the Junior Super Fours, however, continued to improve with both bat and ball. Named as captain of the Junior Emeralds, Westbury led by example in the opening match, taking three wickets and limiting the Rubies to 21 runs off her eight overs, and then top-scoring with 37 for her side in their successful chase. She bowled even more economically in the following match, conceding 12 runs off 10 overs, once again claiming three wickets. Opening the batting for the Emeralds in their reply\u2014as she had done in the first match\u2014she made 46 runs, sharing a partnership of 102 with fellow opener Beth MacGregor to help set up a seven wicket victory. The Emerald's final match saw the Sapphires score more effectively off her bowling, totalling 30 runs from her 10 overs, but Westbury replied with an unbeaten century to propel her side to another seven wicket win. Her 187 runs and 7 wickets ensured she finished the tournament as the most prolific batter and bowler, as the Emeralds won after remaining undefeated."]}, {"page": "Essex Women cricket team", "response": ["* Beth MacGregor (2010)"]}, {"page": "English women's cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2010\u201311", "response": ["England's touring party was announced in September 2010, with first-choice wicket-keeper Sarah Taylor choosing take some time off from international cricket.
