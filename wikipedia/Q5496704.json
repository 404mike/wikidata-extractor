Playing as a winger, he scored 25 goals from 182 appearances in the Football League either side of the Second World War, and was on the winning side for Arsenal in the 1950 FA Cup Final. He then spent 14 years as a manager at Football League level.\nDuring the war, he served as a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gillingham F.C.", "response": ["The club originally played in black and white striped shirts but switched to blue shirts in the 1930s.  The club crest has traditionally depicted the white horse symbol of the county of Kent.  Priestfield Stadium has been the club's home ground throughout its existence; it once held up to 30,000 fans but in the modern era the capacity is less than half that figure.  The club has twice won the championship of English football's fourth tier, in the 1963\u201364 and 2012\u201313 seasons, under managers Freddie Cox and Martin Allen respectively.", "In 1950, plans were announced to expand the Football League Division Three (South) from 22 to 24 teams and, taking into account their local success in the interim, Gillingham were re-elected to the Football League with a landslide vote.  The team spent eight seasons in Division Three (South) before the restructuring of the league system for the 1958\u201359 season saw them placed in the newly created Fourth Division. They remained in this division until 1964, when manager Freddie Cox led them to promotion, winning the first championship in the club's history. The team finished the season level on 60 points with Carlisle United, but with a fractionally better goal average (1.967 against 1.948), which was the tightest league title finish in Football League history.", "In 1939, a year after the club was voted back out of the Football League, Archie Clark took over as manager, and was still in charge when the club was elected back to the Football League in 1950. Clark remained in the job until 1957. Freddie Cox took over in 1962 and led the club to the Football League Fourth Division championship in the 1963\u201364 season, making him the first manager to win a Football League divisional title with the club. Basil Hayward was sacked in 1971 after the club was relegated back to the Fourth Division in the 1970\u201371 season, but his successor Andy Nelson led the club to promotion back to Division Three three years later before controversially resigning."]}, {"page": "AFC Bournemouth", "response": ["*  Freddie Cox (twice)"]}, {"page": "Portsmouth F.C.", "response": ["Freddie Cox became new Portsmouth manager in August 1958. The new 1958\u201359 season was the first Football League season with four national divisions. The two old regional Third Divisions (North and South) which had begun in the 1921\u201322 season were restructured and replaced with two new national divisions, named the Third Division and Fourth Division. At the end of the 1958\u201359 season Portsmouth finished bottom of the First Division, ending their 32-year stay in the First Division, and relegation to the Second Division. By now, the championship winning team of 1949 and 1950 had been broken up, caused by ageing or injury.", "In the 1960\u201361 season Portsmouth finished second-to-last place in the Second Division relegation zone and were relegated once again to the Third Division, (the first former English League champions to do so).

He is usually credited with the change of club name to its current name of AFC Bournemouth. Bond led the club to promotion as Fourth Division runners-up at the end of his first season, and almost to promotion again the following season, as Bournemouth finished third in the Third Division.

Characterised by his pace, physical strength and powerful shooting (but also known for his inconsistent form, much to the frustration of Arsenal's fans), McPherson continued to be a regular in the Arsenal side for the next three seasons, although he missed Arsenal's only other success at the time, the 1950 FA Cup Final, with Freddie Cox and Denis Compton playing on the wings that day."]}]}}
