After spending the weekend together she became pregnant with Vlad (whom she originally named Adam). She reveals her parents persuaded her to give Vlad up for adoption, however, unknown to her it was the Count who secretly adopted him. After some internet research, Vlad discovers that Sally is a sculptor and invites her to Garside pretending to require her to design a sculpture. Vlad remains silent about who and what he really is, but it is not long until she discovers the family are vampires and Vlad is the child she had with the Count. After some encouragement from Vlad and his half sister, George, Sally accepts Vlad's offer to stay at Garside for a few days so they can get to know each other. When Vlad officially becomes the chosen one, he tells Sally that it's not safe for her and George to stay in a world of vampires and tells her he will wipe their memories. (With his Chosen One powers initialised the mind-wipe should be as effective on a loved one as it would be for anyone else victim to a mind-wipe.) Sally originally protests, but because of Vlad's insistence she agrees. She tells Vlad that she and George will always love him, then has a short romantic goodbye with the Count. Vlad gives her part of the yin and yang necklace he received from Talitha, and said by wearing the necklace he and Sally would always be connected. Even after the mindwipe Sally tells George that she loves the necklace and will never take it off.
