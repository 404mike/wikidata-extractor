Hood wrote regularly for The London Magazine,  Athenaeum, and Punch. He later published a magazine largely consisting of his own works. Hood, never robust, had lapsed into invalidism by the age of 41 and died at the age of 45. William Michael Rossetti in 1903 called him \"the finest English poet\" between the generations of Shelley and Tennyson. Hood was the father of the playwright and humorist Tom Hood (1835\u20131874) and the children's writer Frances Freeling Broderip (1830\u20131878).\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
