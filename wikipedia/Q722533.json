Hood wrote regularly for The London Magazine,  Athenaeum, and Punch. He later published a magazine largely consisting of his own works. Hood, never robust, had lapsed into invalidism by the age of 41 and died at the age of 45. William Michael Rossetti in 1903 called him \"the finest English poet\" between the generations of Shelley and Tennyson. Hood was the father of the playwright and humorist Tom Hood (1835\u20131874) and the children's writer Frances Freeling Broderip (1830\u20131878).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Thomas Hood (1798\u20131845, E)"]}, {"page": "The Hunting of the Snark", "response": ["Various themes have been suggested by scholars. According to biographer Florence Becker Lennon, the poem's \"motif of loss of name or identity\" is typical of Carroll's work. Richard Kelly writes that the poem contains a \"theme of annihilation.\" Furthermore, Edward Guiliano feels that the Snark is within the nonsense tradition of Thomas Hood and, especially, W. S. Gilbert, the librettist of the famous Gilbert and Sullivan team. According to him, a case can be made for a direct influence of Gilbert's Bab Ballads on The Hunting of the Snark, based on the fact that Carroll was well-acquainted with the comic writing and the theatre of his age."]}, {"page": "Lamia (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Lamia, dramatic romance by Thomas Hood"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Thomas Hood (1799\u20131845), English humorist and poet; father of playwright and editor Tom Hood"]}, {"page": "Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction", "response": ["Lord Byron's 1816 poem \"Darkness\", included in The Prisoner of Chillon collection, on the apocalyptic end of the world and one man's survival, was one of the earliest English-language works in this genre. The sun was blotted out, leading to darkness and cold which kills off mankind through famine and ice-age conditions. The poem was influential in the emergence of \"the last man\" theme which appeared in the works of several poets, such as \"The Last Man\" by Thomas Campbell (1824) and \"The Last Man\" (1826) by Thomas Hood, as well as \"The Last Man\" by Thomas Lovell Beddoes.

The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1884, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos.
