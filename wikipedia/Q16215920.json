Wheatley always had a plan for the ending and made sure the story was logically consistent, though he states that there are multiple possible interpretations and the cult itself remains scarier when its motives and background are shrouded in mystery. Wheatley states that cultists are a popular choice of antagonist because people are uneasy about the world and feel a lack of control and understanding; politicians and bankers who control their lives seem inscrutable. The cult's symbol was designed by Wheatley, who later recognised influence from The Blair Witch Project. Wheatley was worried people might call him on its similarities, but he was instead surprised to find people comparing it to a symbol from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, with which he is unfamiliar. The film's most violent scene, the hammer murder, came about when Wheatley was surprised at the shocking violence in The Orphanage, which he had assumed would be a subtle art-house film.  Wheatley stated that this turn toward violent horror in The Orphanage made the rest of the film unpredictable; he wanted a similar unpredictability in his own film, so that viewers were never sure whether the film would be subtle or explicit.", "* Nominated: \"Best Actor\" for Neil Maskell"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2011", "response": ["|| Director: Ben Wheatley   Cast: Neil Maskell, Michael Smiley, Emma Fryer", "|| Director: Paul Tanter, Alexander Williams   Cast: Tamer Hassan, Simon Phillips, Olivia Hallinan, Dexter Fletcher, Dominic Burns, Doug Bradley, Adam Deacon, Alan Ford, Jason Flemying, Martin Kemp, Neil Maskell, Jing Lusi", "|| Director: Lee Sales   Cast: George Russo, Ophelia Lovibond, Francis Pope, Neil Maskell, Zara Dawson, Sonny Muslim, Ricci Harnett, Tony Denham, Ben Drew, Peter Ferdinando, Lee Wallace", "|| Director: Dexter Fletcher   Cast: Charlie Creed-Miles, Will Poulter, Liz White, Sammy Williams, Charlotte Spencer, Leo Gregory, Neil Maskell, Iwan Rheon, Jason Flemyng, Jaime Winstone, Olivia Williams, Andy Serkis"]}, {"page": "Turnout (film)", "response": ["Turnout is a British crime drama film written and directed by Lee Sales.
