Whilst the society's council was reluctant to admit women, the wider fellowship was more supportive; only 17% voted against the proposal. Among the first to benefit from this were the ornithologist and photographer Emma Louisa Turner, Lilian J. Veley, a microbiologist and Annie Lorrain Smith, a lichenologist and mycologist, all formally admitted on 19 January 1905. ", "Also numbered in the first cohort of women to be elected in 1904 were: the paleobotanist, and later pioneer of family planning, Marie Stopes, the philanthropist Constance Sladen, founder of the Percy Sladen Memorial Trust and Alice Laura Embleton (1876 \u2013 1960), biologist, zoologist and suffragist, who had been one of the earliest women to deliver a paper to the society on 4 Jun 1903.Gage, A. T. (1938). A history of the Linnean Society of London: Printed for the Linnean Society by Taylor and Francis, p. 90. Although others were admitted in 1904, Marian Farquharson \"was shamefully blackballed\" as the society now states, until admitted in 1908."]}, {"page": "Margaret Fountaine", "response": ["The scientific societies of Britain had historically excluded women. Like the Royal Entomological Society, the Botanical Society of London and Zoological Society only admitted women in the first half of the 19th century. But when Fountaine attended the Second International Congress of Entomology held in Oxford in 1912, she was invited by Edward Poulton, president of the Linnean Society, to formally join the society. This marked the height of her entomological career. 15 years earlier Beatrix Potter had been unable to attend a reading of her own paper at the society, because she was a woman. The botanist Marian Farquharson had petitioned learned societies to admit women. Farquharson's petition prompted members of the Linnean Society to put the matter to a vote in 1903. Female fellows were allowed, and in 1904 a ballot was taken on 15 prospective women fellows.Waring (2015), p. 53."]}, {"page": "Royal Microscopical Society", "response": ["In 1885, botanist and women's rights campaigner Marian Farquharson, became the first female Fellow of the Society. Although not permitted to attend meetings, her greatest contribution to the scientific community was of her campaign in gaining women rights to full fellowship of learned societies. In 1900 she sent a letter addressed to the Royal Society and the Linnean Society petitioning that \"duly qualified women should be eligible for ordinary Fellowship and, if elected, there should be no restriction forbidding their attendance at meetings\". Both societies refused her requests to join, eventually the Linnean Society elected her as a fellow in 1908."]}, {"page": "List of female fellows of the Royal Society", "response": ["The first recorded question of women being admitted to the Royal Society occurred in 1900, when Marian Farquharson, the first female fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society, sent a letter to the Council of the Royal Society petitioning that \"duly qualified women should have the advantage of full fellowship\". In its reply, the Council stated that the question of women fellows \"must depend on the interpretation to be placed upon the Royal Charters under which the Society has been governed for more than three hundred years\". When Hertha Ayrton was nominated for fellowship in 1902, her candidature was turned down on the basis that as a married woman she had no standing in law. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 made it illegal for an incorporated society to refuse admission on the grounds of an individual's sex or marital status. While the Society acknowledged the provision of section 1 of the Act in 1925, in reply to a question originally put to them by the Women's Engineering Society three years prior, it was not until 1943 that another woman was nominated for fellowship. Kathleen Lonsdale and Marjory Stephenson were duly elected in 1945, after a postal vote amending the Society's statutes to explicitly allow women fellows."]}, {"page": "Index of women scientists articles", "response": ["*Marian Farquharson"]}, {"page": "List of women botanists", "response": ["| Marian Farquharson"]}, {"page": "Timeline of women in science", "response": ["*1885: British naturalist Marian Farquharson became the first female Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society."]}, {"page": "Marian Ogilvie Farquharson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Marian Farquharson"]}]}}
