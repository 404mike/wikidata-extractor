The first trophy to be won was the Medaglia del Re (\"King's Medal\") in January 1900, and the team later won three national leagues, in 1901, 1906 and 1907. The triumph of 1901 was particularly relevant because it ended the consecutive series of wins of Genoa, which had been the only team to have won the title prior to 1901. On 9 March 1908, issues over the signing of foreign players led to a split and the foundation of Football Club Internazionale."]}, {"page": "Herbert Kilpin", "response": ["By 1898, Kilpin had already left Turin and settled in Milan with fellow Englishman Samuel Richard Davies.
