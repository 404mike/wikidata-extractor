But we were going to fix that and we were frustrated by others.\" He has also suggested that the Royal Bank of Scotland prevented him paying back the debt to them: \"I can't go into the details but I can confirm the funds were available to pay off Royal Bank of Scotland entirely but between Royal Bank of Scotland, the chairman and the employees that conspired against us, they would not let us.\"", "After more legal trouble with his other sports team, Hicks decided not to pursue his claims of a conspiracy against him.http://thelfczone.com/site/2011/05/06/fan-power-wins-the-day-liverpool-fc-an-epic-swindle-part-two/ On January 11, 2013, Hicks and Gillett finally decided to drop their case in the English law courts against Sir Martin Broughton, Christian Purslow and Ian Ayre, the three directors on the club's board of directors at the time of the sale of the club to NESV; they also agreed to drop their case against NESV and RBS Bank.
