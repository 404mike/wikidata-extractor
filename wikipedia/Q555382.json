He immediately regained his place upon his return to fitness, again at the expense of Leon Barnett in the narrow 2\u20131 defeat to Manchester United.

The charity stated that they intended to work with the local authority to refurbish the entire site, transforming it into a community football hub to promote health, wellbeing and education in the area.They also agreed to offer Southwick 1882 FC the use of the ground for their home fixtures. Initially, it was hoped that the ground could be made ready in time for the 2021\u201322 season but after structural surveys it was discovered that the ground was in a much worse state of repair than predicted. Additionally, it was found that the clubhouse construction consists of large quantities of asbestos, and long-term water damage had become so bad that the new leaseholders were advised that Legionnaires Disease could be a hazard. There is also a considerable amount of rubble to be removed and derelict fencing that needs to be replaced, as well as part of the enclosing perimeter stone wall that is falling down. Hence, as of January 2022, the ground remains derelict and requires over \u00a3500,000 worth of repairs in order to make it fit for purpose."]}, {"page": "Anthony McNamee", "response": ["At the start of the 2010\u201311 season, McNamee started the season, coming on as a substitute in a number of matches.
