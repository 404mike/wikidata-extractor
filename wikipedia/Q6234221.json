Working originally with the Daily Express he pioneered a new form of fashion photography suited to reproduction in newsprint, involving where possible reflected natural light and low contrast. He also undertook portrait photography. French himself devoted much attention to the set and posing of his models, but left the actual triggering of the shutter to assistants, amongst whom were Terence Donovan and David Bailey.In 1942 he married Vere Denning (1910\u201391), a fashion journalist, who gave his photographic archive to the Victoria and Albert Museum. French died of lymphoma in the Royal Marsden Hospital.", "link_mentions": {}}}
