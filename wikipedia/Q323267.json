Reynolds found that if a porous plate is kept hotter on one side than the other, the interactions between gas molecules and the plates are such that gas will flow through from the hotter to the cooler side. The vanes of a typical Crookes radiometer are not porous, but the space past their edges behaves like the pores in Reynolds's plate. On average, the gas molecules move from the hot side toward the cold side whenever the pressure ratio is less than the square root of the (absolute) temperature ratio. The pressure difference causes the vane to move, cold (white) side forward due to the tangential force of the movement of the rarefied gas moving from the hotter edge to the colder edge."]}, {"page": "Cavitation", "response": ["As early as 1754, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707\u20131783) speculated about the possibility of cavitation.

From p. 266:  \"Il pourroit donc arriver que la pression en M devint m\u00eame n\u00e9gative, & alors l'eau abandonneroit les parois du tuyau, & y laisseroit un vuide, si elle n'\u00e9toit pas comprim\u00e9e par le poids de l'atmosph\u00e8re.\" (It could therefore happen that the pressure in M might even become negative, and then the water would let go of the walls of the pipe, and would leave a void there, if it were not compressed by the weight of the atmosphere.)  In 1859, the English mathematician William Henry Besant (1828\u20131917) published a solution to the problem of the dynamics of the collapse of a spherical cavity in a fluid, which had been presented by the Anglo-Irish mathematician George Stokes (1819\u20131903) as one of the Cambridge [University] Senate-house problems and riders for the year 1847.(Cravotto & Cintas, 2012), p. 26.

This factor, now known as the Reynolds number, is a basic parameter in the description of all fluid-flow situations, including the shapes of flow patterns, the ease of heat transfer, and the onset of turbulence. This comprises the central scientific justification for the use of models in wind tunnels to simulate real-life phenomena. However, there are limitations on conditions in which dynamic similarity is based upon the Reynolds number alone."]}, {"page": "Dimensionless quantity", "response": ["Quantities having dimension one, dimensionless quantities, regularly occur in sciences, and are formally treated within the field of dimensional analysis. In the nineteenth century, French mathematician Joseph Fourier and Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell led significant developments in the modern concepts of dimension and unit.  Later work by British physicists Osborne Reynolds and Lord Rayleigh contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics.  Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, Edgar Buckingham proved the  theorem (independently of French mathematician Joseph Bertrand's previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities."]}, {"page": "North West England", "response": ["W.

Chapman later reflected, \"I sometimes wonder what would have happened if I'd hit one place lower.\" He initially studied engineering in the department headed by Osborne Reynolds. Chapman was taught mathematics by Horace Lamb, the Beyer professor of mathematics, and J. E. Littlewood, who came from Cambridge in Chapman's final year at Manchester. Although he graduated with an engineering degree, Chapman had become so enthusiastic for mathematics that he stayed for one further year to take a mathematics degree. Following Lamb's suggestion, Chapman applied for a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. He was at first awarded only a partial scholarship as a sizar (meaning that he obtained financial support by acting as a servant to other students), but from his second year onwards he received a full scholarship. He graduated as a wrangler in 1910. He began his research in pure mathematics under G. H.
