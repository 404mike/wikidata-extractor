However at a meeting on 28 June, Sproson was severely criticized for his supposed poor judgement of players and for seeming to place greater priority on his newsagent business than the club. The Sentinel reported that \"there is disenchantment in the air\", and there were rumours that former Stoke manager Tony Waddington would be brought in to replace Sproson. Sproson was sacked in October 1977 after a poor run of results. His replacement Bobby Smith failed to rescue Vale from relegation despite making numerous signings. England manager Don Revie had predicted such a fate when he said at a dinner that \"English football suffers from the same complaint all the time. You've got two local lads here as your management team [referring to Sproson and his assistant Reg Berks].
