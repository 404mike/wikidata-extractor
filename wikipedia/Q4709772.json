Its leader, Sir Albert Bore, said that the Council accepted the Ofsted findings that schools in the city were failing pupils. Birmingham City Council commissioned Ian Kershaw of Northern Education Trust in Newcastle to review the evidence. However, because some of the schools were academies under the responsibility of the Department for Education, the then Secretary of State, Michael Gove, commissioned a separate report by Peter Clarke, the former head of the Metropolitan police's counterterrorism command. The two inquiries shared evidence, with the Kershaw inquiry deferring matters of extremism to the Clarke inquiry. The latter found that there is \"no evidence to suggest that there is a problem with governance generally\" nor any \"evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern in Birmingham,\" but said that there was \"evidence that there are a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of influence in schools and governing bodies, who espouse, sympathise with or fail to challenge extremist views,\" and that there had been \"co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained\" attempts \"by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos\" into \"a few schools in Birmingham.\" The report found that senior council officials and elected members were apparently aware of these issues, but dealt with them on a case-by-case basis rather than making \"any serious attempt to see if there was a pattern,\" though it is not clear whether this was due to \"community cohesion,\" ", "On 14 April, the City Council confirmed that it had received over 200 reports from parents and staff at 25 schools in Birmingham. Council leader Sir Albert Bore stated that his council had spoken to authorities in Bradford and Manchester, and said that there are \"certainly issues in Bradford which have similarities with the issues being spoken about in Birmingham\". Concerns have also been raised by the National Association of Head Teachers about schools in parts of East London and other \"large cities around the country\". Senior Department for Education sources have also been reported as claiming that coordinated attempts to undermine and supplant head teachers have occurred in Bradford, Manchester, and the London boroughs of Waltham Forest and Tower Hamlets.", "Sir Albert Bore, the leader of Birmingham City Council, called the original Trojan Horse letter \"defamatory\" and \"hugely difficult to investigate\" and offered protection to the whistleblower if they would come forward to help in the investigation. He later said that the Council accepted the Ofsted findings that schools in the city were failing pupils.
