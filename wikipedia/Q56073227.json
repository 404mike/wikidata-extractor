However, he missed two matches, due to a calf injury he sustained during a 3\u20131 loss against Walsall in the first round of the League Cup, which he captained the side. It wasn't until on 1 September 2018 when Bakayogo made his return from injury, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1\u20131 draw against Northampton Town. He then set up two goals for Harvey Gilmour, who played a huge role, in a 4\u20133 win over Morecambe on 6 October 2018. However, Bakayogo suffered a hamstring injury during the match and was sidelined for a month. It wasn't until on 17 November 2018 when he returned to the first team from injury and set up a goal for Ollie Banks, in a 3\u20132 loss against Crewe Alexandra. Due to strong competition in the club's defence, he was often used in first team ins and out for the side, resulting in him being placed on the substitute bench. However, Bakayogo, once again, faced his own injury concern throughout the 2018\u201319 season and lost his first team place to Liam Ridehalgh. Despite not being involved in the team, the club won promotion to League One after beating Newport County 1-0 at Wembley in the 2019 League Two play-off final, following a 6th-place finish in League Two. At the end of the 2018\u201319 season, making twenty\u2013five appearances, Bakayogo was released by the club."]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["| 7 January 2019 || CM ||  || Harvey Gilmour || Tranmere Rovers || Undisclosed || ", "| 13 July 2018 || MF ||  || Harvey Gilmour || Tranmere Rovers || 7 January 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 7 January 2019 || CM ||  || Harvey Gilmour || Sheffield United || Undisclosed || ", "| 13 July 2018 || MF ||  || Harvey Gilmour || Sheffield United || 7 January 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2019 EFL League Two play-off Final", "response": ["|MF ||22||Harvey Gilmour"]}, {"page": "Harvey James Gilmour", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harvey Gilmour"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 22 August 2020 || CM ||  || Harvey Gilmour ||  Stockport County || Free Transfer || "]}]}}
