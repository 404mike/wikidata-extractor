Large club-shaped glands are present at the apex of the leaves, flowers insignificant with membranous perianth, 2-3 mm, green, unisexual with both sexes on the same plant, in one to three-flowered clusters. The male flowers have a valvate to globose  perianth, splitting into  two to five lobes when the flower opens. There are 7 up to 12 but sometimes as few as 2 and as many as 30 stamens with filiform filaments and anthers that are erect in the bud, but pendulous later, the female flowers have a tubular shortly toothed perianth and ovary of a single  carpel containing a single basal  ovule. The style is simple and arises from the base of the ovary. The ovary  enlarges irregularly on one side  and  the style becomes lateral at fruiting time. The fruit is a subglobose nut-like drupe 2mm, containing one seed with a fleshy endosperm. It exhibits myrmecochory which is dispersal of seeds by the agency of ants. Ants feed on the oil body or elaiosome of  various seeds and frequently carry the seed some distance from the parent plant. The oil body of the seed is formed of a portion of the pericarp which remains attached to the base of the seed. The ants eat the oil body  and then leave  the seed undamaged. Young shoots of T. Cynocrambe are sometimes eaten as a vegetable. Grows in rocky habitats, sandy ground, old walls, often in damp and shaded places.
