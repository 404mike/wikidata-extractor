However, the BBC reported that Ince would be named as Blackburn manager by the end of the week of 19 June. He was appointed on 22 June and became the first black British manager in England's top division. On the first day of the 2008\u201309 FA Premier League season, Blackburn faced Everton at Goodison Park for Ince's first Premier League game with Blackburn. David Dunn opened the scoring for Ince's side and Roque Santa Cruz and Andre Ooijer later scored in a 3\u20132 win.

He won his first trophy as full-time captain, playing the full 90 minutes as Arsenal beat Manchester City 3\u20130 in the 2014 FA Community Shield. Despite his new appointment, he would only make 11 appearances for the whole season, scoring once. Arteta signed a one-year extension with Arsenal for the 2015\u201316 season and came on as a substitute as Arsenal beat Chelsea 1\u20130 to win the 2015 FA Community Shield, his first competitive appearance for the club since November 2014. His final game for Arsenal came on the last day of the season. Arteta came on as a substitute and forced Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bunn into scoring an own goal after his shot went off the crossbar. He received a standing ovation from the crowd at full time."]}, {"page": "John Ruddy", "response": ["For the 2012\u201313 season Ruddy found himself first choice again ahead of Declan Rudd, Jed Steer and new goalie Mark Bunn. Once again, he saved a penalty during Norwich's first home Premier League fixture of the season during a 1\u20131 draw with Queens Park Rangers, although Bobby Zamora scored the rebound. He kept memorable clean sheets against Arsenal and Manchester United as Norwich won 1\u20130 on both occasions, both occurring during an outstanding run of form that saw him keep four clean sheets and concede just two goals in six matches. Unfortunately this great run of form came to an end during a 1\u20131 draw against his former club Everton when he suffered a thigh injury. He later underwent surgery, ruling him out for three months. However, Ruddy's injury later worsened, with the expectation that he would not be fit again until April. Ruddy returned to action on 7 May 2013 in Norwich's 4\u20130 Premier League win over West Bromwich Albion, which confirmed mathematical safety from relegation. He also played in Norwich's final match of the season on 19 May 2013, a 3\u20132 away win against Manchester City."]}, {"page": "Jack Hobbs (footballer)", "response": ["On 16 May 2008, BBC Sport wrote that Hobbs was indecisive about whether to fight for first-team opportunities at Liverpool or to join another club for more playing opportunities. On 25 May, Hobbs signed for League One club Leicester City on loan for the 2008\u201309 season. On joining the club, he said he wanted to help Leicester win promotion to the Championship. He made his debut on 9 August in a 2\u20130 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, when he came on as an 88th-minute substitute for Aleksandar Tunchev. Hobbs scored his first goal on 24 January 2009, with a header from Steve Howard's flick-on in a 4\u20132 victory over Huddersfield Town. He was red carded on 21 February in a match against Bristol Rovers for fouling Darryl Duffy. However, the resultant penalty by Rickie Lambert was saved by Mark Bunn. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson commented that the red card was unfortunate, as he believed the foul was not intentional. In his first season with the club, besides winning the League One title and achieving promotion to the Championship, Hobbs was also included in the PFA Team of the Year. He was also voted as the club's Young Player of the Year, as he made 44 appearances, in which his team conceded 37 goals."]}, {"page": "Steve Simonsen", "response": ["With their first choice keeper Paddy Kenny suspended and previous loanee goalkeeper Mark Bunn being recalled to Blackburn Rovers, Simonsen signed a one-month loan deal with Sheffield United in March 2010.

Stockdale extended his loan at Leicester until the end of the season on 6 April. He played for Leicester as their promotion to the Championship as League One champions was confirmed after a 2\u20130 victory over Southend United, after which he said he would be interested in joining the club for the following season."]}, {"page": "Frank Fielding", "response": ["Fielding again started the 2010\u201311 season out of the first team picture as Paul Robinson's understudy. He was linked with a move to Championship side Derby County. The interest caused Fielding to issue a \"come-and-get-me\" plea, stating \"It is the worst feeling when you are training all week and not playing - so if anyone wants me on loan, I'm available!\" He joined Derby on a four-week emergency loan on 15 October 2010 and went straight into the squad for the home match against Preston North End the next day, keeping a clean sheet on his debut as the team ran out 3\u20130 winners. The loan was extended for an additional month on 13 November, after his seven appearances had reaped three clean sheets and 15 points from a possible 21 as Derby moved to fourth in the table. After Stephen Bywater returned from his wrist injury, Fielding returned to Blackburn in December. He was then named on the subs bench for Blackburn to cover from Mark Bunn when Paul Robinson picked up an injury. In February 2011, after Bywater and Saul Deeney picked up injuries, Fielding returned to Derby on loan. Though the deal was initially announced as being until the end of the 2010\u201311 season, Fielding's two month emergency loan deal with the club in October and November meant that he could only remain at the club for an additional month, with his second stay ending after the away fixture at Crystal Palace on 19 March 2011, though Fielding would train with the Derby squad for the remainder of the season."]}, {"page": "Chris Doig", "response": ["Doig signed for former club Northampton on 30 June 2005 and finished his first season with 45 appearances and three goals, as the side earned promotion to League One as League Two runners-up.

Shortly before the match against Huddersfield Town in April 2007, Doig came third in the club's Player of the Year awards, behind Jason Crowe and Mark Bunn. Doig penned a two-year contract that would expire in 2009.
