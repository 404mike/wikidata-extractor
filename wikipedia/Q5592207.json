He also introduced new training regimes to increase player fitness and was successful in steering the club to good results against a number of established Premier League sides, including Rangers, Celtic, Motherwell, Hearts and Hibs.  After a period of just over thirteen months at the club he left to become the new Dundee United manager after the sacking of Gordon Chisholm."]}, {"page": "Charlie Christie", "response": ["After retiring as a player, Christie continued in his role as a youth development coach at Caley Thistle.
