In total he played 500 League games (550 including cup games) in that time, scoring 168 League goals with 11 more in the FA Cup.

Hodge was not expected to be first choice for Wednesday for the 1983\u201384 season with Iain Hesford expected to be number one goalkeeper. However a combination of Hodge's good pre season form and Hesford' weight problems ensured that Hodge played the opening match of the season against Swansea City and never looked back. His time at Sheffield Wednesday was excellent he played 214 consecutive League and Cup matches, a club record beating Mark Hooper's previous record of 189 and was part of the Wednesday side which gained promotion back to Division One in 1983\u201384 and then had several good seasons on their return to the top flight.\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\", Tony Matthews, , Gives biographical information."]}, {"page": "1935 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The 1935 FA Cup Final was contested by Sheffield Wednesday and West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. Sheffield Wednesday won 4\u20132, with goals scored by Jack Palethorpe, Mark Hooper and Ellis Rimmer (2). Wally Boyes and Teddy Sandford scored West Brom's goals. It is the most recent time that the trophy has been won by Sheffield Wednesday, and would be their last major trophy win for 56 years, until they won the Football League Cup in 1991.", "The match had a thrilling start when Wednesday took the lead after just two minutes, a West Brom attack broke down leaving Ted Catlin injured on the floor, however referee Bert Fogg played an advantage and a quick break saw Mark Hooper and Ronnie Starling combine to feed Jack Palethorpe who hit a right foot shot into the corner of the goal. Albion however started to play some good football and got themselves back into the match after 21 minutes when the youngest player on the field, 22-year-old Wally Boyes, a boyhood Wednesdayite from Sheffield scored an equaliser. The diminutive left winger took a pass from Carter and hit a stinging, rising drive from the left side of the penalty area which gave Jack Brown no chance. The score remained at 1\u20131 until half time.", "The early stages of the second half saw Ronnie Starling miss a chance and then have another effort cleared off the line. Not to be deterred Starling was prominent in Wednesday re-taking the lead on 70 minutes when his pass released Mark Hooper who beat two men before hitting a shot past Harold Pearson that went in off a post. Within five minutes West Brom were level as a Teddy Sandford shot was deflected into the net off Walt Millership. At this stage West Brom looked the likely winners with some of the Wednesday players arguing amongst themselves as they kicked off. It was during this stage of the game that the limping Joe Carter missed his two good chances, hitting the post with one of them. W. G. Richardson also missed a fine opportunity. With only five minutes remaining and extra time looking a distinct possibility Ellis Rimmer, who had had a quiet match up till that point made his mark on the match. He chased a long through ball from Wilf Sharp and the tall winger got his head to the ball just before West Brom keeper Pearson could reach it and guided it into the net. In the final minute Rimmer scored his second goal when Pearson could only parry a Mark Hooper shot and Rimmer knocked the ball home from close range. Wednesday had won the cup and Ellis Rimmer had scored in every round.\"Sheffield Football, A History\", Keith Farnsworth,  Page 200 (Gives details of match).\"Wednesday\", Keith Farnsworth, pages 132\u2013135 (Gives details of match and team selections).", "| ||7 || Mark Hooper"]}, {"page": "Neil Dewar", "response": ["On the pitch, Dewar proved to be a good purchase for Wednesday manager Billy Walker, with the striker going straight in to the team and scoring on a regular basis.

Jones' debut for Wednesday, a 3\u20131 away win over Liverpool on 5 April 1930,Sheffield Wednesday stats at the Wednesday archive happened to be his only appearance for the club in his first season with them. Nevertheless, the Owls won the league by 10 points that season, scoring a total of 105 goals in the process. With Mark Hooper well established as the first-choice at outside-right, the 1930\u201331 season also saw Jones only make one appearance, but this time he also managed to get his name on the scoresheet, scoring Wednesday's only goal in a 4\u20131 away defeat to Manchester United. The season resulted in the first of three consecutive third-place finishes for Wednesday, the second of which saw Jones score four goals in 11 appearances, before scoring one more goal in 10 appearances in 1932\u201333. The 1933\u201334 season was much less successful for the Owls, as they finished the season in 11th place in the First Division; Jones made just six appearances, and failed to get on the scoresheet."]}, {"page": "Tommy Winship", "response": ["He began the 1924\u201325 season in the reserves, Walter Creasor being preferred at outside left, but soon returned to first-team duties. In their first defeat of the season, away to Rochdale in mid-September, the Athletic News reported that \"Winship was the pick of the Darlington forwards, and several of his early centres should have been turned to good account\", and two weeks later he produced a \"swinging shot which curled into the net\" to open the scoring at home to Bradford. Darlington soon established a lead at the top of the division which they were to hold for the rest of the season, despite their team containing numerous \"real old stagers\", players who were well known before the war. Winship himself was still \"nippy\", despite his veteran status, though not as quick as the outside-right Mark Hooper."]}, {"page": "1935 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||7 || Mark Hooper"]}, {"page": "Hooper, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Hooper"]}]}}
