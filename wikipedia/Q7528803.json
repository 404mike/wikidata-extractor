He rose through the ranks after his entry, fighting as a lieutenant under Howe at the Glorious First of June, and being wounded in the action. Shortly after he served in the West Indies and off the American coast, where he operated successfully against enemy raiders and privateers, he was rewarded with the command of the frigate HMS Cleopatra, and in 1805 fought an action with a superior French opponent, Ville de Milan. He was forced to surrender his ship after several hours of fighting, but so heavily damaged the Frenchman that both she and the captured British vessel were taken shortly afterwards when another British frigate HMS Leander, arrived on the scene. Rewarded for his valour and honourably acquitted for the loss of his ship, he served throughout the rest of the Napoleonic Wars. He rose to flag rank after the end of the wars, eventually dying in 1848 with the rank of Admiral of the White. He inherited a baronetcy in 1804, but this became extinct upon his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laurie baronets", "response": ["*Sir Robert Laurie, 6th Baronet (1764\u20131848)"]}, {"page": "Robert Laurie", "response": ["* Sir Robert Laurie, 6th Baronet (1764\u20131848), admiral in the Royal Navy"]}, {"page": "Laurie (surname)", "response": ["*Sir Robert Laurie, 6th Baronet KCB (1764\u20131848), an officer of the Royal Navy"]}, {"page": "Sir Robert Laurie, 5th Baronet", "response": ["Laurie was extremely irregular in his attendance in Parliament, but retained his seat until his death on 10 September 1804.
