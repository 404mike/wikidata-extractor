However, in November 1839, the British invaded Kalat, and the Khan was killed in action during the invasion. Afterwards, the British influence in the region gradually grew. In 1869, the British Political Agent Robert Groves Sandeman ended up mediating a dispute between the Khan of Kalat and the Sardars of Balochistan, and established the British primacy in the region. The tribal areas of Marri, Bugti, Khetran and Chaghi were brought under the direct administration of a British Agent, eventually to become the Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan.

In 1871 the British (representing the Khan of Kalat and Indian Subcontinent) and the Persians agreed to define their mutual frontier; a boundary commission surveyed the area the following year but did not mark the border on the ground. British penetration of Balochistan, under Sir Robert Groves Sandeman, continued apace over the following decades, prompting a more precise boundary to be agreed and marked with pillars on the ground in 1895\u201396.
