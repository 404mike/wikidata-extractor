The following day, the four-man board convened in Edwards' Old Trafford office and decided a change of manager had to be made. The unanimous decision was to see if Alex Ferguson, then manager of Aberdeen F.C. in the Scottish league was available. According to Ferguson's autobiography, he received a telephone call in his office at Pittodrie from a man with a Scottish accent. He subsequently discovered that this was Manchester United director Michael Edelson who asked Ferguson if he would be interested in meeting Edwards. Following a short discussion, Edwards made contact with Aberdeen F.C. chairman Dick Donald and the four-man United board drove immediately to meet Ferguson halfway between the two cities in Glasgow. Negotiations were quickly concluded and 72 hours later Ferguson was installed as manager of Manchester United."]}, {"page": "Miss World 1983", "response": ["* Michael Edelson"]}, {"page": "Nick Leslau", "response": ["In 1997, Leslau and Wray set up their own small property company Maybeat Limited, which they merged into one of Michael Edelson's Alternative Investment Market listed shell companies called Prestbury Group plc."]}, {"page": "List of people from Bury", "response": ["* Michael Edelson (born 1944), businessman; Director of Manchester United Football Club"]}, {"page": "Edelson (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Michael Edelson (born 1944), investor and director of Manchester United F.C.", "* Michael Edelson (lawyer) (born 1949), Canadian criminal defence lawyer"]}, {"page": "Edelson, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Edelson"]}]}}
