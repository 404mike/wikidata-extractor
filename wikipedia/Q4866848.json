He also became a member of the Standing Committee of the Oxford Union. Khanbhai joined the Conservative Party, and stood for them in Norwich South at the 1997 general election, but was not elected. At the 1999 European Parliament election, he was elected from third position on the Conservative Party list in the East of England.\nIn 2004, Khanbhai repaid \u00a37,000 of wrongly claimed travel expenses; although he lived in Sevenoaks, Kent, he had registered a boatyard in Wroxham as his home address. In light of this expenses scandal, he was deselected by his party, and did not stand in the 2004 election. He subsequently claimed that he had been treated differently from other Conservative MEPs in similar positions, ascribing this to racist elements within the party.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom (1999\u20132004)", "response": ["| Bashir Khanbhai   "]}, {"page": "Members of the European Parliament for the United Kingdom 1999\u20132004 by region", "response": ["# Bashir Khanbhai"]}, {"page": "List of members of the European Parliament (1999\u20132004)", "response": ["*Bashir Khanbhai"]}, {"page": "East of England (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Bashir KhanbhaiConservative"]}, {"page": "Tanga Region", "response": ["*Bashir Khanbhai, British politician"]}, {"page": "List of British Pakistanis", "response": ["* Bashir Khanbhai \u2013 former Conservative MEP for East of England"]}, {"page": "List of ethnic minority politicians in the United Kingdom", "response": ["|Bashir Khanbhai"]}, {"page": "List of British Muslims", "response": ["* Bashir Khanbhai  former Conservative MEP for East of England "]}, {"page": "List of British Punjabis", "response": ["*Bashir Khanbhai \u2013 former MEP for East of England and Conservative Party politician."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*Bashir Khanbhai, 74, Tanzanian-born British politician.Bashir Khanbhai"]}]}}
