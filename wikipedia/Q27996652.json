His father was Rhun ab Eneas Ledewig the Breton, his mother was the sister of Peibio Clafrog, King of Ergyng, and his grandmother was possibly the former wife of Saint Gwen Teirbron. As a youth he became a follower of his cousin Saint Dyfrig, and worked alongside Saint Teilo when Teilo returned to Llandeilo Fawr in around 560. In his later years he became Bishop of Ergyng and perhaps died in around 625.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peibio Clafrog", "response": ["Peibio was also the uncle of Saint Inabwy, disciple of Dubricius and Bishop of Ergyng."]}]}}
