He was encouraged in this by the director of the Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) and by his election to Fellowship of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1936. En route back to London in 1932 Gardner stopped off in Egypt and, armed with a letter of introduction, joined Sir Flinders Petrie who was excavating the site of Tall al-Ajjul in Palestine. Arriving in London in August 1932 he attended a conference on prehistory and protohistory at King's College London, attending at least two lectures which described the cult of the Mother Goddess. He also befriended the archaeologist and practising Pagan Alexander Keiller, known for his excavations at Avebury, who would encourage Gardner to join in with the excavations at Hembury Hill in Devon, also attended by Aileen Fox and Mary Leakey."]}, {"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Aileen Fox (1907\u20132005) British; South West England"]}, {"page": "1907 in literature", "response": ["*July 29 \u2013 Aileen Fox (n\u00e9e Henderson), English archaeologist (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "2000 in literature", "response": ["*Aileen Fox \u2013 Aileen: a Pioneering Archaeologist (autobiography)"]}, {"page": "1964 in literature", "response": ["*Aileen Fox \u2013 South West England (Ancient peoples and places series)Henrietta Quinnell, \"Fox, Aileen Mary, Lady Fox (1907\u20132005)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2009) Retrieved 21 November 2017"]}, {"page": "2005 in literature", "response": ["*November 21 \u2013 Aileen Fox, English archaeologist (born 1907)"]}, {"page": "2005 in Wales", "response": ["*21 November - Aileen Fox, archaeologist and widow of Sir Cyril Fox, 98"]}, {"page": "2005 in archaeology", "response": ["* November 21 - Aileen Fox, English archaeologist (b. 1907)."]}, {"page": "Cyril Fox", "response": ["Fox became keeper of archaeology at the National Museum of Wales from 1926 to 1948.

It was while at Exeter that he carried out his most notable archaeological fieldwork. Todd uncovered a previously unrecognised Roman occupation of the Iron Age hillfort in Hembury.

However, it is apparent that under Miss Atkins and her headmistress in the 1910s, Miss Thwaites, the establishment was principally a girls' school that accepted a limited number of boarders. The distinguished archaeologist Aileen Fox (then Aileen Henderson) remembered, on joining the school as an 11-year-old in 1918: Chinthurst was run by the formidable Miss Thwaites, and took some thirty girls, some of them boarders, between the ages of eight and fifteen. We were divided into three classes, mostly taught by Miss Thwaites ... a Dickensian figure, shabbily dressed, thin, erect, with a sallow complexion, a pointed nose, dark eyes and a penetrating voice.
