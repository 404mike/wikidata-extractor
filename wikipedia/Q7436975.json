Oakes began his career at Leicester City but was transferred to Luton in 1991 as part of the deal that took Steve Thompson the opposite way.\nAt Luton, Oakes soon became a regular in the side, and a fan favourite, usually playing on the left wing. During his time at Kenilworth Road, he became regarded as one of the most promising players in English football, and was often rumoured as a target for bigger clubs. He was capped once for England Under-21.\nIn 1996, Oakes was signed by Sheffield Wednesday for a \u00a3425,000 transfer fee. However, the move to the Owls would turn out disastrous. Following a spate of unfortunate injuries, Oakes spent most of his time on the sidelines in the 1996\u201397 season, and the following seasons he usually was not even on the bench due to a knee injury that cruelly dogged what had been a promising career at the age of just 25. In his four years at Hillsborough, Oakes started only seven games, scoring once against Sunderland, and in 1999\u20132000, his final season with the Owls, he did not feature for the first team at all.\nIn 2000, Oakes was released by Sheffield Wednesday and joined Burnley, and then moved to Cambridge United a mere three months later. He finished his Football League career with a spell at Leyton Orient before signing for non-league St Albans City in 2002.\nIn 2003, he signed for Shelbourne but only lasted three games due to the poor health of one of his children.\nHis younger brother Stefan Oakes is also a professional footballer.\nHis father is the musician Trevor Oakes, who performed with Showaddywaddy.\nHe now works teaching football to children in schools in Leicestershire and Bedfordshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Showaddywaddy", "response": ["Al James retired from the band in 2008, playing his last gig with the band at the Cheese & Grain in Frome, Somerset, on 20 December 2008.

Trevor Oakes is the father of footballers Scott Oakes and Stefan Oakes. Challenger is the father of Benjamin Challenger who trialled for Leicester City before playing basketball for Leicester Riders then moving into athletics, gained medals in the high jump at the 1998 and 2002 Commonwealth Games.
