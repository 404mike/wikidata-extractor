This work, in collaboration with his colleague Alan Hall, resulted in the identification of NRAS, a new human oncogene. Subsequent work from his laboratory showed that NRAS has important roles in leukaemia and others demonstrated the role of NRAS in melanoma. Following the identification of NRAS, Marshall concentrated on studying how NRAS and the two other RAS genes, HRAS and KRAS, act in cancer. His work in the field of cell signalling showed how RAS and other signalling proteins are involved in transmitting signals from outside of the cell all the way to the cell nucleus. His work laid the foundation for studies that showed the importance of the BRAF cancer gene in melanoma."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Alan Hall||||1930||11||4||"]}, {"page": "Journal of Cell Biology", "response": ["*October 2014 \u2013 May 2015: Alan Hall is Editor in Chief."]}, {"page": "Allan Hall", "response": ["*Alan Hall (1952\u20132015), British cell biologist, best known for studying the role of Ras superfamily proteins in cancer"]}]}}
