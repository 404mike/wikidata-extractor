His fairness and diplomacy earned him the nicknames of \"The George Washington of Sheffield football\" and \"Honest Ted\". Davison played as a goalkeeper in a career, which lasted between 1908 and 1926, he made 424 appearances in all competitions for Sheffield Wednesday (his only league club). Davison was only 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, very small for a goalkeeper, but he made up for this with lightning reflexes and top class anticipation. He has gone down in football records as the smallest goalkeeper ever to play for England, making just one appearance for the national team in March 1922.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Banks", "response": ["He was scouted by Chesterfield whilst playing for Millspaugh, and offered a six-game trial in the youth team in March 1953. He impressed enough in these games to be offered a part-time \u00a33-a-week contract by manager Teddy Davison in July 1953. The reserve team were placed in the Central League on account of a powerful club director rather than on merit, and Banks conceded 122 goals in the 1954\u201355 season as the \"Spireites\" finished in last place with only three victories. Banks was posted to Germany with the Royal Signals on national service, and won the Rhine Cup with his regimental team. He recovered from a fractured elbow to help the Chesterfield youth team to the 1956 final of the FA Youth Cup. There they were beaten 4\u20133 on aggregate by Manchester United's famous \"Busby Babes\"\u2014a team that included both Wilf McGuinness and Bobby Charlton."]}, {"page": "Sheffield United F.C.", "response": ["Following the death of John Nicholson (who died whilst travelling to an away match in Birmingham) the United board turned to Chesterfield manager Teddy Davison to become the club's first real manager. The team were in decline however and were soon relegated for the first time in their history.  Davison gradually rebuilt the side with astute signings and young players and regained top flight status but the clubs post-war financial problems would hamper team building for years to come.  Davison retired in 1952 and prompted the club to appoint Rotherham United manager Reg Freeman as his successor.  Freeman stabilised the team but fell ill and died in 1955 after which United turned to the inexperienced Joe Mercer but he struggled to cope with a team in decline and departed for Aston Villa in 1958. United then appointed Chester manager John Harris who inherited a talented but under performing side which he transformed into a promotion team, returning to Division One in 1961. Harris built a side based on local players and stabilised them in the top flight but financial issues soon prompted the sale of key players and United were eventually relegated once more. Harris opted to 'move upstairs' to become 'general manager' and handed the role of team manager to Arthur Rowley but he was sacked after one season following disappointing results. Harris returned as manager and guided the side to promotion once more but after a good start back in the top flight Harris' confidence faded and he stepped down in 1973 to 'move upstairs' for the second time."]}, {"page": "Davison (surname)", "response": ["*Teddy Davison (1887\u20131971), English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Chesterfield F.C.", "response": ["|Teddy Davison|| English||1927\u20131932", "|Teddy Davison|| English||1952\u20131958"]}, {"page": "Mansfield Town F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Teddy Davison"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Hagan", "response": ["Hagan was born in Washington, County Durham, England.
