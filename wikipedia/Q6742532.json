He made 30 appearances during the 1952\u201353 season, keeping ten clean sheets, as Preston finished runners-up to Arsenal for the First Division title. On 14 February 1953, Preston North End were playing Sheffield Wednesday at Deepdale; Derek Dooley was chasing a long pass from Albert Quixall when he collided with Thompson just as he made contact with the ball, breaking the centre-forward's leg in two places. Dooley never recovered from his injuries with gangrene setting into his leg, and as a result had to have his right leg amputated just above the knee, thus ending his playing career."]}, {"page": "Monty Newlands", "response": ["#REDIRECT Malcolm Newlands"]}]}}
