Now based in Manchester, the band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Matthew \"Matty\" Healy, lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross MacDonald, and drummer George Daniel.The band's origins trace to their attendance at secondary school and playing together as teenagers. Gigs, organised by a council worker, led the band to sign with Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. The band opened for several major acts and released a series of extended plays (Facedown, Sex, Music for Cars, IV) throughout 2012 before releasing their self-titled debut album (2013), which included the popular singles \"Sex\", \"Chocolate\", and \"Robbers\" and reached number one in the United Kingdom.\nTheir second album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016), reached No. 1 in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the touring cycle for the record, the band announced their third album under the working title of Music for Cars, before going on hiatus again throughout 2017.\nReturning in 2018, the band announced that the album had evolved into their third campaign cycle, consisting of their third and fourth studio albums. The first, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships (2018), was released to widespread critical acclaim, and became their third No. 1 album in the UK. The second, Notes on a Conditional Form, was released in May 2020 and became their fourth consecutive No. 1 album in the UK.\nThe 1975 has garnered acclaim for their relevant lyricism and exploration of an eclectic range of genres such as pop rock, synth-pop, R&B, electropop, new wave forms of electronic music (such as UK garage, 2-step and ambient), and forms of rock music (such as shoegaze, post-punk and post-rock), as well as elements of jazz, soul and gospel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grammy Award for Best Rock Song", "response": ["* George Daniel, Adam Hann, Matthew Healy & Ross MacDonald \u2013 \"Give Yourself a Try\" (The 1975)"]}, {"page": "Girls (The 1975 song)", "response": ["* Adam Hann \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "62nd Annual Grammy Awards", "response": ["**George Daniel, Adam Hann, Matthew Healy & Ross MacDonald, songwriters (The 1975)"]}]}}
