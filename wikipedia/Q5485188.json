This, wrote S. R. Epstein, was the \"professional, extensively researched and documented\" story of Bloch's life, and, he commented, probably had to \"overcome a strong sense of protectiveness among the guardians of Bloch's and the Annales memory\". Since then, continuing scholarship\u2014such as that by Stirling, who calls Bloch a visionary, although a \"flawed\" one\u2014has been more critically objective of Bloch's recognisable weaknesses. For example, although he was a keen advocate for chronological precision and textual accuracy, his only major work in this area, a discussion of Osbert of Clare's Life of Edward the Confessor, was subsequently \"seriously criticised\" by later experts in the field such as R. W. Southern and Frank Barlow; Epstein later suggested Bloch was \"a mediocre theoretician but an adept artisan of method\". Colleagues who worked with him occasionally complained that Bloch's manner could be \"cold, distant, and both timid and hypocritical\" due to the strong views he had held on the failure of the French education system. Bloch's reduction of the role of individuals, and their personal beliefs, in changing society or making history has been challenged. Even Febvre, reviewing Feudal Society on its post-war publication, suggested that Bloch had unnecessarily ignored the individual's role in societal development."]}, {"page": "Pope Adrian IV", "response": ["Following Adrian's death, comments Barber, \"the consequence for the church was another long and bitter schism\". Tensions between different parties led to a double election, with \"mutually unacceptable candidates\". This led to what Frank Barlow has called \"disgraceful scenes\" taking place in Rome, but, with neither side powerful enough to overcome the other, each appealed to the European powers."]}, {"page": "William II of England", "response": ["Historian Frank Barlow observed William was \"[a] rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality\u2014indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.\" On the other hand, he was a wise ruler and victorious general. Barlow noted, \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered Maine, and kept up the pressure on the Vexin.\""]}, {"page": "Edward the Confessor", "response": ["Historians disagree about Edward's fairly long 24-year reign. His nickname reflects the traditional image of him as unworldly and pious. Confessor reflects his reputation as a saint who did not suffer martyrdom as opposed to his uncle, King Edward the Martyr. Some portray Edward the Confessor's reign as leading to the disintegration of royal power in England and the advance in power of the House of Godwin, because of the infighting that began after his death with no heirs to the throne. Biographers Frank Barlow and Peter Rex, on the other hand, portray Edward as a successful king, one who was energetic, resourceful and sometimes ruthless; they argue that the Norman conquest shortly after his death tarnished his image. However, Richard Mortimer argues that the return of the Godwins from exile in 1052 \"meant the effective end of his exercise of power\", citing Edward's reduced activity as implying \"a withdrawal from affairs\".", "Edward spent a quarter of a century in exile, probably mainly in Normandy, although there is no evidence of his location until the early 1030s. He probably received support from his sister Godgifu, who married Drogo of Mantes, count of Vexin in about 1024. In the early 1030s, Edward witnessed four charters in Normandy, signing two of them as king of England. According to William of Jumi\u00e8ges, the Norman chronicler, Robert I, Duke of Normandy attempted an invasion of England to place Edward on the throne in about 1034 but it was blown off course to Jersey. He also received support for his claim to the throne from several continental abbots, particularly Robert, abbot of the Norman abbey of Jumi\u00e8ges, who later became Edward's Archbishop of Canterbury. Edward was said to have developed an intense personal piety during this period, but modern historians regard this as a product of the later medieval campaign for his canonisation. In Frank Barlow's view \"in his lifestyle would seem to have been that of a typical member of the rustic nobility\". He appeared to have a slim prospect of acceding to the English throne during this period, and his ambitious mother was more interested in supporting Harthacnut, her son by Cnut.", "Edward's position when he came to the throne was weak. Effective rule required keeping on terms with the three leading earls, but loyalty to the ancient house of Wessex had been eroded by the period of Danish rule, and only Leofric was descended from a family which had served \u00c6thelred. Siward was probably Danish, and although Godwin was English, he was one of Cnut's new men, married to Cnut's former sister-in-law. However, in his early years Edward restored the traditional strong monarchy, showing himself, in Frank Barlow's view, \"a vigorous and ambitious man, a true son of the impetuous \u00c6thelred and the formidable Emma.\""]}, {"page": "Harold Harefoot", "response": ["In 1036, \u00c6lfred \u00c6theling, son of Emma by the long-dead \u00c6thelred, returned to the kingdom from exile in the Duchy of Normandy with his brother Edward the Confessor, with some show of arms. Their motivation is uncertain. William of Poitiers claimed that they had come to claim the English throne for themselves. Frank Barlow suspected that Emma had invited them, possibly to use them against Harold. If so, it could mean that Emma had abandoned the cause of Harthacnut, probably to strengthen her own position, but that could have inspired Godwin to also abandon the lost cause."]}, {"page": "Leofric (bishop)", "response": ["Before Edward the Confessor became king of England, he was exiled to the continent. Leofric served as Edward's chaplain, although how or when exactly the two met is unknown.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 50 The historian Frank Barlow speculates that it may have been at Bruges in 1039. When Edward returned to England at the invitation of King Harthacnut, Edward's half-brother, Leofric accompanied him, witnessing charters during Harthacnut's lifetime along with Herman who later became Bishop of Sherborne.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 53 Leofric remained a close supporter and friend of Edward for the king's entire life. In 1044, Edward granted him lands at Dawlish in Devon.Powell and Wallis House of Lords p. 3", "The notice in his cathedral's records recording his death stated that Leofric was active in his diocese as a preacher, that he built many churches in his bishopric, and was noted as a teacher of his clergy.

The king ordered Godwin to punish the town, and the earl refused. Continued pressure from Edward undermined Godwin's position, and the earl and his family fled England in 1051.Stafford Unification and Conquest pp. 90\u201391 The earl returned in 1052 with a substantial armed force but eventually reached a peaceful accord with the king. Some medieval sources state that Stigand took part in the negotiations that reached a peace between the king and his earl;Mason House of Godwine p. 73 the Canterbury manuscript of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle calls Stigand the king's chaplain and advisor during the negotiations.Rex Harold II p. 61", "King Edward, on his deathbed, left the crown to his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson, the son of Earl Godwin. Stigand performed the funeral services for Edward.Rex Harold II p. 197 Norman writers claimed that Stigand crowned Harold as king in January 1066.Chibnall Anglo-Norman England p. 21 This is generally considered false propaganda, as it was in William's interest to portray Harold as uncanonically crowned. If Harold was improperly crowned, then William was merely claiming his rightful inheritance, and not deposing a rightful king.Higham Death of Anglo-Saxon England pp. 175\u2013180 The Bayeux Tapestry depicts Stigand at Harold's coronation, although not actually placing the crown on Harold's head.Rex Harold II p. 151 The English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, crowned Harold, while the Norman sources claim that Stigand did so, with the conflict between the various sources probably tracing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify Harold and depict his coronation as improper. Current historical research has shown that the ceremony was performed by Ealdred, owing to the controversy about Stigand's position. However, one historian, Pauline Stafford, theorises that both archbishops may have consecrated Harold.Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 83 Another historian, Frank Barlow, writing in 1979, felt that the fact that some of the English sources do not name who consecrated Harold \"tip(s) the balance in favour of Stigand\".Barlow English Church 1000\u20131066 p. 60 footnote 4", "Although monastic chroniclers after the Norman Conquest accused him of crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any evidence of those crimes.Smith \"Archbishop Stigand\" Anglo-Norman Studies 16 p. 217Stafford Queen Emma and Queen Edith p. 151 Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, was taunted in 1164 by King Henry II's barons with Stigand's fate for daring to oppose his king.Rumble \"From Winchester to Canterbury\" Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church p. 180 Modern historians views tend to see him as either a wily politician and indifferent bishop or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings. The historian Frank Stenton felt that his \"whole career shows that he was essentially a politician\".Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 466 Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that \"Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power.\"Higham Death of Anglo-Saxon England pp. 219\u2013220 Another historian, Eric John, said that \"Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom\".John Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England p. 174 However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that \"he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held\". Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was \"unlucky to live so long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms\".Rumble \"From Winchester to Canterbury\"  Leaders of the Anglo-Saxon Church p. 179"]}, {"page": "Theobald of Bec", "response": ["Theobald's family was from the area around Thierville near Le Bec-Hellouin, in the Risle River valley.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 11 The modern historian Frank Barlow speculates that Theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop, Thomas Becket, as Becket's family came from the same part of Normandy.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 23 The exact date of Theobald's birth is unknown; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man,Saltman Theobald pp. 3\u20134 suggesting a birth date of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian. His father was supposedly a knight, but no contemporary reference gives his name.Barlow \"Theobald\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography His brother Walter also became a priest, and later a bishop.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 401", "Although Theobald was troubled by the opposition of his suffragan Henry of Blois, he regained control of the English Church, secured the rights of his see, and helped maintain the unity of the realm. Contemporaries were somewhat divided on his effectiveness and personality. Gervase of Canterbury felt that he was too impetuous, probably because of Theobald's treatment of his priors at Christ Church. Henry of Huntingdon, who knew him, felt that he was a worthy archbishop. Theobald's legacy perhaps suffered because he was overshadowed by his successor, Becket.

The construction technique of combining a pointed arch with another rib allowed a six-pointed vault, which enabled the building to attain a greater height than earlier churches. This permitted larger clerestory windows, and let more light into the building. The technique of the six-pointed vault spread to Saint-Etienne in Caen from which it influenced the development of early Gothic architecture near Paris.Adams History of Western Art p. 200 The system of rib vaulting in the choir was the earliest use of that technique in Europe.Croix Gardner's Art Through the Ages p. 352 The historian Frank Barlow called the cathedral \"one of the architectural jewels of western Christendom\"."]}, {"page": "1911 in literature", "response": ["**Frank Barlow, English historian, (died 2009))"]}, {"page": "1986 in literature", "response": ["*Frank Barlow \u2013 Thomas Becket"]}, {"page": "1955 in literature", "response": ["*Frank Barlow \u2013 The Feudal Kingdom of England"]}, {"page": "Justiciar", "response": ["The Norman kings were often overseas and appointed a justiciar, regent or lieutenant to represent them in the kingdom, as the sheriff did in the shire.
