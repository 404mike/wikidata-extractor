Giovanni Morelli (1816 \u2013 1891) pioneered the systematic study of the scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists' scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears or hands, in Western old master paintings.  His techniques were adopted by Bernard Berenson and others, and have been applied to sculpture and many other types of art, for example by Sir John Beazley to Attic vase painting.Elsner, 103; Dictionary of Art Historians: \"Giovanni Morelli\"  Personal techniques can be important in analysing individual style.  Though artists' training was before Modernism essentially imitative, relying on taught technical methods, whether learnt as an apprentice in a workshop or later as a student in an academy, there was always room for personal variation.  The idea of technical \"secrets\" closely guarded by the master who developed them, is a long-standing topos in art history from Vasari's probably mythical account of Jan van Eyck to the secretive habits of Georges Seurat.Gotlieb, throughout; 469\u2013475 on Vasari and van Eyck; 469 on Seurat.

A tradition of this type has been discerned in 5th century BC Greek pottery\u2014John Beazley identified a scene of Apollo, Delian palm in hand, revenging Orion for the attempted rape of Artemis, while another scholar has identified a scene of Orion attacking Artemis as she is revenged by a snake (a counterpart to the scorpion) in a funerary group\u2014supposedly symbolizing the hope that even the criminal Orion could be made immortal, as well as an astronomical scene in which Cephalus is thought to stand in for Orion and his constellation, also reflecting this system of iconography.; (cf.

A total of 32 vases are attributed to Exekias as painter in the most recent study, E.A. Mackay, Tradition and Originality: A Study of Exekias (Oxford: BAR, 2010). His signed pieces provide insight not only into the work of Exekias himself but also into the way ancient pottery workshops operated. Twelve of the fourteen vessels bearing his name refer to him not as their painter but as their potter, by adding the word epo\u00ed\u0113sen (\u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd) to his name.J.D. Beazley, \u201cExekias,\u201d The Development of Attic Black-Figure (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951; 1986), 58.

On two amphorae, Berlin 1720 and Vatican 344, both terms are used in the iambic trimeter inscription, Ex\u0113k\u00edas \u00e9grapse kapo\u00ed\u0113s\u00e9 me (\"Exekias made and painted me\"), indicating that in these cases Exekias was responsible for both the potting of the vase and its painted decoration.Beazley, The Development of Attic Black Figure, 59-60. Fragments of a third amphora (Taranto 179196) also show the use of both terms, when the inscriptions are restored.Mackay, Tradition and Originality: A Study of Exekias, 135-136. This leads to speculation regarding the meaning of the epo\u00ed\u0113sen signatures and why, in some instances, Exekias signed only as potter on vases that he clearly painted as well. It has been suggested that he chose to sign as painter only the works he was particularly proud of. According to a different approach, Exekias' epo\u00ed\u0113sen signatures could be understood as functioning as a general workshop stamp, which would mean that Exekias may have simply been the master-potter who supervised the production of the vessel.R.M. Cook, \u201c\u2018Epoiesen on Greek Vases,\u201d Journal of Hellenic Studies 91 (1971): 137-38. Seven of the vessels signed \"Ex\u0113kias epo\u00ed\u0113sen,\" however, carry too little decoration to afford comparison. Only two of the remaining vases signed with epo\u00ed\u0113sen can be attributed to the same hand as those signed \"... \u00e9grapse kapo\u00ed\u0113s\u00e9 me\"\u2014that is, to the painter Exekias.

The painting is black from the top of the neck down to the middle of the neck with a tongue pattern interrupting the black and red in the middle of the neck. Below the tongue pattern is a three flower pattern wrapped around the neck of the lekythos. The flower pattern extends from the tongue pattern at the thinnest part of the neck down to the top of the shoulder. It has one handle (black with red on the inside) that extends the length of the neck ending at the shoulder. Wrapped around the shoulder is a red meander pattern interrupted by a saltire pattern every fourth box. Underneath the shoulder is where the main decoration is located. It is a picture of the Titaness Eos with her lover, Kephalos. Eos is, in Greek mythology, the goddess of the dawn. Kephalos was her lover, she can be seen in other vase paintings holding Kephalos, who is sometimes painted in the nude. In this painting, both figures are clothed. Eos is identified by her wings and flowing robes. Eos\u2019 eyes are triangular and directed toward Kephalos.
