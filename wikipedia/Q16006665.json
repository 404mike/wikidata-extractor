After turning professional later in 1920, he defeated current and former champions, including former world welterweight champion Ted \"Kid\" Lewis in 1925. Due to then Home Secretary Winston Churchill's decision in 1911 to support a colour bar, he was banned from competing at both the Royal Albert Hall and National Sporting Club. Additionally, the British Boxing Board of Control would not sanction a championship bout with Johnson for the Lonsdale Belt, due to their Rule 24, which stated that title contestants \"[...] must have two white parents\", though despite this he defeated Harry Collins in Australia for the middleweight championship of the British Empire in 1926. Johnson became famous in Britain for his impressive victories, defeating European and British middleweight champion Roland Todd in 1927. In the same year, he also defeated future middleweight champion Len Harvey, and rounded up the decade thrashing European middleweight champion Leone Jaccovacci in 1928 and European light-heavyweight champion Michele Bonaglia in 1929.", "By 7 February, contracts had been signed for Johnson to meet former European middleweight champion Roland Todd (78-9-3) at King's Hall, Manchester for twenty-rounds. At the weigh-in, Johnson, 22 at the time of the fight, was inside the stipulated weight limit of 158 pounds; though Todd, 25, was slightly above 160 pounds. At that point in time, the crowd of 7,000 that attended was the largest crowd that had ever attended a boxing match in Manchester. Todd was beaten for the first time in England since his return from America, when Johnson gained the verdict on points, awarded by referee Joe Palmer on 23 February. Despite Todd being the current British and Commonwealth middleweight champion, the titles were not at stake for Johnson as the contest was at catchweight, and the National Sporting Club did not consider Johnson to be an Englishman.", "On 16 August 1925, The Sunday Mirror announced that Johnson would face Roland Todd at Belle Vue, Manchester at the end of September. Additionally, Hull Daily Mail announced the match as being agreed upon, with the contest will be deprived of championship status, albeit at the middleweight limit; the return match will be on 21 September, with Eugene Corri as referee. On 5 September 1925, The Liverpool Echo reported that Johnson would face former European middleweight champion, Roland Todd in Manchester on 25 September. On 25 September 1925, with a crowd of over 6,000, Johnson defeated Todd, the middleweight champion of Great Britain, on points at Belle Vue, Manchester. Todd, who was strongly fancied, was favoured six to four and had former middleweight champion Gus Platts in his corner. Both Johnson and Todd had successfully passed the scales at the weigh-in earlier that very day. In the initial round, Todd was first to score twice in succession with a flashing straight left. Afterwards, Johnson levelled matters by using both hands to the both. Round two distinctly favoured Todd, who clipped his opponent on the jaw with the right, and scored freely with the left, gaining a nice advantage. Both men exhibited great coolness, and a bout of in-fighting followed in the third, when Todd was twice shaken by a couple of right hooks to the face. Later, champion Todd retaliated with interest by bringing his left nicely into play, and scoring freely in a rally at close quarters. In this round, Johnson, whose work had been exceptionally clever, opened a cut over Todd's left eye with his hard straight hitting with the left glove. The fifth round was exceptionally interesting, Todd's left leads being cleverly stopped by Johnson who, in tern, scored with a stiff blow to the mouth. Subsequently, Todd again rallied strongly, and showing all his old-time cleverness in defence, took the round by a good margin. Johnson's blows were powerfully delivered for the most part, but try as he would with his heavy right swings, he generally failed to connect owing to the clever defensive work of the champion. Up to round ten, Todd quite monopolised the scoring, with his experience staning him in good stead, and he was rarely at home when Johnson tried to launch an attack. At the end of the tenth, Todd held a nice lead on points, but at this stage the boxing took a wonderful turn. Todd was obviously tiring rapidly, and in the 11th round he was subjected to heavy punishment; Johnson making full use of his longer reach. Todd, however, was cheered for some good work at close range, but his injured eye by now had taken a rather serious turn. Johnson was always on top in the remaining rounds, Todd repeatedly hanging on. The referee, Eugene Corri, had no hesitation in declaring Johnson the winner. However, Corri's decision did not meet with the complete approval of spectators, which resulted in several free-fights taking place in the body of the hall. In the aftermath, Todd claimed that he did not legitimately lose his crown with the loss of the decision, though no British sportsman had supported Todd in this attitude.", "A year prior, on 23 February 1924, The Sportsman reported that Johnson and former middleweight world champion Ted \"Kid\" Lewis were originally scheduled to meet at the Belle Vue Gardens in Manchester on 3 March. On 7 October 1925, The Westminster Gazette announced that Johnson was matched with Kid Lewis for 26 November. The event was a fifteen-round contest at the 160 pound limit at King's Hall, Manchester. Boxers such as Tommy Burns, Roland Todd, and Jimmy Wilde would all be in attendance. The bout represented a contrast of styles, with the uncanny boxing skill of Johnson up against the experience and in-fighting of Kid Lewis. Opinions on the fight were mixed, although in general more pundits favoured Johnson, as some doubted Kid Lewis would break though Johnson's \"rare defence\". The undercard contained Phil Scott and Charlie Ring's three-round exhibition, and Albert Marchant's encounter with featherweight champion Johnny Curley.", "On 18 January 1926, it was revealed that Johnson had arrived in Australia, under the engagement of Jack Munro, and was scheduled for five fights in Australia. He acknowledged that \"[...] a coloured man can't hold the Lonsdale belt\", though remarked that he was unsure of whom he had to meet, though expected to be first billed to box Harry Collins. On 4 February 1926, Birmingham Daily Gazette reported that a match was arranged to take place on 13 February at the Sydney Stadium between Johnson and Australian champion Harry Collins, in which is described as the middleweight championship of the British Empire. Birmingham Daily Gazette also revealed that Johnson has stated \"down under\" that he is the holder of the English title, though the British Boxing Board of Control rendered it vacant by taking it away from Roland Todd, whilst expanding \"Owning to his colour, Johnson cannot fight for the English title, and his contest with Collins cannot be for the championship of the British Empire.\" Additionally, on 4 February, The Daily Mail also pointed out that as Johnson is ineligible for an English boxing title, the contest cannot be sanctioned for the championship of the British Empire. On 9 February, the National Sporting Club were described as being aghast at the suggestion and pointed out that although Johnson had beaten the current middleweight Lonsdale belt-holder, he cannot become English champion on account of his colour, as only full-blooded whites can hold the boxing titles in conservative England. If Collins were to have won the encounter with Johnson, he would have qualified for a meeting with the winner of the Tommy Milligan and Mickey Walker contest for the world welterweight title."]}, {"page": "List of European Boxing Union champions", "response": ["|align=left | Roland Todd"]}, {"page": "Professional boxing record of Len Johnson", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Roland Todd", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Roland Todd"]}]}}
