Although set in a hospital, it uses no medical storylines; the action is produced by a series of soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasising the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.", "Green Wing was devised, created and produced by Victoria Pile. She was also the casting director, one of the writers and was involved in the editing, filming and post-production. She described Green Wing as \"a sketch-meets-comedy-drama-meets-soap\", and a continuation of her previous show, Smack the Pony, where Green Wing's crew also worked. Unusually for a British sitcom, which normally has only one or two writers, the show had eight: Pile, her husband Robert Harley, Gary Howe, Stuart Kenworthy, Oriane Messina, Richard Preddy, Fay Rusling and James Henry.", "Green Wing's title is said to have come from a small plastic green man with wings that was in executive producer Peter Fincham's top pocket, and fell on Pile's desk.

However, creator Victoria Pile mentioned in a 2007 interview in the Radio Times that she may do a spin-off, saying, \"I'm hoping to do another Channel 4 comedy imminently, possibly starring some of the same cast. Hopefully, it will be some kind of spin-off from Green Wing.\"", "A cocktail called the Green Wing was served at the 2005 BAFTAs.
