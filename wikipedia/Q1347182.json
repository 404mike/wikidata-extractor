Produced by record engineer and musician Rupert Hine, these two albums saw Rush shedding much of its keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with Presto (1989), the band opted for arrangements notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used, the instrument was no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush's compositions. Continuing this trend, Roll the Bones (1991) extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated other musical styles such as funk and hip hop in \"Roll the Bones\" and jazz in the instrumental track \"Where's My Thing?\".Roll the Bones [ Allmusic:].

In another incident her heart stopped. A disastrous appearance on Saturday Night Live was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to seize up.

Though Rush felt confident enough to undertake production duties themselves, they still wanted someone they could trust and to provide an objective point of view to their ideas. Among the various candidates was English producer, songwriter, and keyboardist Rupert Hine, whose experience with a variety of artists attracted the group. Peart recalled the time when they presented their ideas to Hine: \"We were a little bemused [...] at the end of some of them he actually seemed to be laughing! We looked at each other, eyebrows raised as if to say: \"He thinks our songs are funny?\" But evidently it was a laugh of pleasure; he stayed 'til the end\". At Hine's suggestion, the group brought in Stephen W. Tayler as the recording and mixing engineer.

Initially, they talked to a lot of young producers, but they soon realized that there was little to gain from someone who had worked on fewer albums than the group had released over its career and sought someone experienced. Rush chose English producer Peter Collins who'd co-produced Power Windows (1985) and Hold Your Fire (1987) with the band. Lee said that the band had remained friendly with Collins, and noticed he'd developed as a producer since they'd last worked with him, including his work with more American rock bands. \"As soon as we talked we knew it would be great [...] and he agreed with the vision of what we saw; and his comments, criticizing the past couple records, sonically anyway, were very much in line with the direction we wanted to go, and we thought, 'Bingo! Here you go, this is what we need.' Collins had different engineers in mind to work with, so a \"laborious but interesting search\" took place to find someone suitable that involved hearing tapes from artists worldwide. In the end, they chose Kevin \"The Caveman\" Shirley for the recording; Lee said it was because of his \"raw\" and \"natural\" sound, which required minimal use of reverb which was difficult for the band to get used to at first.
