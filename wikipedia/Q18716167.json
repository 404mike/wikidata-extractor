The Irons drew 0\u20130 away to the south coast, before losing the replay four days later 1\u20134, with the only goal being scored by Henry Hird. The month ended farcically when in a Southern League game on 29 October, they faced a Wycombe side who had lost their previous five matches.  The Irons missed their train and arrives at the Buckinghamshire's Loakes Park ground an hour late.  The obviously unsettled side eventually played the game in torrential rain and were two goals down after 15 minutes from goals scored by Jim Aldridge.  Aldridge had completed his hat-trick by half time.
