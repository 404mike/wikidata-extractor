He saw service during the Nine Years' War, and the Wars of the Spanish Succession, Quadruple Alliance and Austrian Succession.\nBrown entered the navy in about 1695, through the patronage of Sir George Byng, afterwards Lord Torrington. He was appointed captain of HMS Strombolo in 1709. He commanded HMS York in 1717, and HMS Advice in 1726 in the cruises up the Baltic Sea. In 1727, during the siege of Gibraltar by the Spaniards, he commanded HMS Oxford, and in 1731 HMS Buckingham in the Mediterranean. In 1738 he was appointed to command HMS Hampton Court, and was senior officer at this station until the arrival of Admiral Edward Vernon in the following year.\nHis opportunity arrived in 1739, when, during the War of Jenkins' Ear, he served under Vernon in the attack on Portobello, in the isthmus of Darien. He led the squadron into Boca Chica, placing his vessel, the Hampton Court, alongside the strongest part of the fortifications. When the fortress surrendered, the Spanish governor presented his sword in token of submission. Brown very properly declined to receive it, saying he was but 'second in command,' and took the governor in his boat to Admiral Vernon. But the Spaniard was obstinate, declaring that but for the insupportable fire of the commodore he never would have yielded. Thereupon Vernon, very handsomely turning to Brown, presented to him the sword, which is still in the possession of his descendants. In 1741 Brown was appointed to the office of commissioner of the navy at Chatham, a situation which he held with unblemished reputation until his death, on 23 March 1753. His daughter, Lucy, became the wife of Admiral William Parry, commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands; and her daughter and namesake married Captain William Locker, under whom Lord Nelson served in his early days, and who subsequently became lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital. There was a portrait of Brown in the Painted Hall at Greenwich, which subsequently passed in the hands of the successor institution, the National Maritime Museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Brown", "response": ["* Charles Brown (musician) (1922\u20131999), American blues singer", "* Charles Brown (actor) (1946\u20132004), American actor with Negro Ensemble Company", "* Charles Brown (Royal Navy officer) (c. 1678\u20131753), Royal Navy officer", "* Charles Brown (Medal of Honor, 1864) (1841\u20131919), American Civil War Medal of Honor recipient", "* Charles Brown (Medal of Honor, 1872) (1849\u2013?), American 1871 Korean Expedition Marine and Medal of Honor recipient", "* Charles Brown (congressman) (1797\u20131883), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "* Charles Brown (mayor) (1873\u20131943), mayor of Murray, Utah, 1906\u20131909", "* Charles Brown (Wisconsin politician) (born 1828), Wisconsin state assemblyman", "* Charles Brown (Australian politician) (1895\u20131970), Australian politician from Queensland", "* Charles Brown (Labour politician) (1884\u20131940), British Labour Party Member of Parliament for Mansfield, 1929\u20131940", "* Charles Brown (New Zealand politician) (1820\u20131901), from Taranaki", "* Charles Brown (offensive lineman) (born 1987), American football player", "* Charles Brown (boxer) (born 1939), American Olympic bronze medalist", "* Charles Brown (cricketer, born 1815) (1815\u20131875), English cricketer", "* Charles Brown (cricketer, born 1854) (1854\u20131917), Australian-born English cricketer", "* Charles Brown (ice hockey) (born 1947), American ice hockey player", "* Charles Brown (roque player) (1867\u20131937), American Olympic bronze medalist", "* Charles Brown (rugby union, born 1887) (1887\u20131966), New Zealand rugby union player", "* Charles Brown (water polo), New Zealand water polo player", "* Charles Brown (wrestler), British Olympic wrestler", "* Charles Brown (British engineer) (1827\u20131905), British engineer", "* Charles Browne (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "William Locker (Royal Navy officer)", "response": ["In 1770 William married Lucy, the daughter of Admiral William Parry and the granddaughter of Commodore Charles Brown.
