The handle is usually covered with a rubber grip. Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a tapered splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson, a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel. Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break at the corner of the join. The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat's blade to the handle and avoids this problem."]}, {"page": "Charles Richardson", "response": ["Charles Richardson may refer to:", "*Charles Richardson (umpire) (1853\u20131925), English Test cricket umpire", "*Charles Richardson (cricketer, born 1864) (1864\u20131949), Australian-born New Zealand cricketer", "*Charles Richardson (Essex cricketer) (1885\u20131948), English cricketer who played for Essex", "*Charles Richardson (Lincolnshire cricketer) (born 1946), former English cricketer who played for Lincolnshire", "*Charles Richardson (civil engineer) (1814\u20131896), British civil engineer", "*Charles Richardson (cement merchant) (1819\u20131878), British businessman", "*Charles Richardson (Australian politician) (fl. 1861), New South Wales politician", "*Charles Richardson (Upper Canada politician) (1805\u20131848), lawyer and political figure in Upper Canada", "*Charles Richardson (lexicographer) (1775\u20131865), English teacher, lexicographer and linguist"]}, {"page": "Wharncliffe Viaduct", "response": ["The contractor was the partnership of Thomas Grissell and Samuel Morton Peto.
