Young's British superiors were also unhappy with his decision to run, with High Commissioner Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer writing to Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord Knutsford, stating that he had strong reservations about Young being a candidate as he suspected Young would neglect his official duties and would not be sufficiently independent of government when serving in the Council.Protopapas, pp151\u2013153"]}, {"page": "Sihayo kaXongo", "response": ["Sihayo's wives and their lovers sought refuge in the kraals of two Natal border guards.  The colonial authorities had long permitted Zulu refugees to settle in Natal but, until 1875, fleeing wives were regarded as chattels and returned to their husbands.  The Zulu had crossed into Natal in 1877 to capture a female refugee and the lieutenant-governor of Natal, Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer, had complained to Cetshwayo.  The British frequently crossed the border in the other direction in pursuit of fugitives and on at least one occasion Cetshwayo had delivered up such men to the British.  Mehlokazulu therefore considered that there would be no serious repercussions if he crossed the border to capture the women.  Mehlokazulu, and others in Sihayo's household, crossed the border and seized the junior wife, dragged her back to Zululand and killed her.  A few days later some 80 of Sihayo's men, led by the five male family members, did the same to Kaqwelebana, killing her on the Zulu bank of the Buffalo, within sight of Rorke's Drift which had become a Swedish missionary post.  In neither case were the women's male lovers or the border guards harmed."]}]}}
