On a hot Saturday afternoon, in front of a crowd of 6,524, the Mayor of Southampton (Alderman G.J. Tilling) kicked off \"like an international\". The Saints soon took the lead when with \"a little finessing\", Tom Smith passed the ball through to Watty Keay who scored The Dell's first goal. Jim McKenzie missed some good chances and, with Southampton attacking in numbers, Bullimer in the Brighton goal was kept busy. Towards the end of the first-half, Arthur Chadwick accidentally caught Brighton's centre-forward Willie McArthur on the chin with a high kick. Bleeding profusely, McArthur left the pitch and Brighton had to continue with only ten men. Shortly before the interval, Abe Hartley scored the second goal, after a smart run up the left by McKenzie. In the second half, McKenzie added a third before Roddy McLeod reduced the deficit. With over a quarter of an hour to play, Smith completed the scoring, with  a goal described as \"just such a goal as there is no doubt about \u2013 a shot which beats the goalkeeper almost before it is made\".", "| Jim McKenzie", "| Jim McKenzie"]}]}}
