Speaking after being announced as Stoke's new manager, Hughes admitted that he had a point to prove following his disappointing spell at QPR. Hughes' first task was to release Rory Delap, Mamady Sidibe, Matthew Upson, Dean Whitehead, Carlo Nash and Matty Lund, at the same time giving Jermaine Pennant a new contract. He made his first signing on 28 June 2013 in Dutch international left-back Erik Pieters from PSV for a fee of \u20ac3.6\u00a0million (\u00a33\u00a0million). Hughes' first match in charge of Stoke on 17 August 2013 ended in a 1\u20130 defeat at Liverpool. Hughes' first win as Stoke manager came in his next match as Stoke beat Crystal Palace 2\u20131 at the Britannia Stadium. This was followed up by a 1\u20130 win away at West Ham. On 2 September 2013, transfer deadline day, Hughes brought in Austrian forward Marko Arnautovi\u0107 from Werder Bremen and Stephen Ireland on loan from Aston Villa.

Departing were Matthew Etherington, Michael Kightly, Cameron Jerome and Ryan Shotton. Stoke had a mixed start to the 2014\u201315 season, losing 1\u20130 to Aston Villa on the opening day, drawing 1\u20131 with ten-men Hull City, yet defeating reigning Premier League champions Manchester City 1\u20130. Stoke's inconsistency continued through the autumn as Stoke managed just three wins beating Newcastle, Swansea and Tottenham. The club then suffered frustrating home defeats against newly promoted Burnley and Leicester City.
