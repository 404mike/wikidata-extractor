He played for nine clubs during a fifteen-year career. Over half of his 148 goals in the Football League were scored during his three spells with Blackpool.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["Torquay won promotion again on 31 May 1991, winning a play-off final on the club's second visit to Wembley against higher-placed Blackpool. Goals from Wes Saunders and Dean Edwards earned Torquay a 2\u20132 draw in normal time. No further goals in extra time resulted in a penalty shoot-out. Successful penalties by Micky Holmes, Wes Saunders, Paul Holmes, Chris Myers and goalkeeper Gareth Howells, combined with Dave Bamber's miss for the opposition, made Torquay winners 5\u20134 on penalties. The Gulls were promoted to Division Three due to this victory."]}, {"page": "Blackpool F.C.", "response": ["Sam Ellis took over from Brown in June 1982, three years after he finished his playing career with Watford. His first season saw Blackpool finish 21st, with Dave Bamber topping the club's goalscoring chart for the second consecutive season with 10 strikes."]}, {"page": "Alan Ball Jr.", "response": ["The following month he joined Colchester United as assistant to Jock Wallace and in October 1989 took up a similar post under Mick Mills at Stoke City. However, Mills was sacked two weeks later and Ball was promoted to the manager's seat. He came to the conclusion that the squad he had inherited was simply not good enough and out went Chris Kamara, Dave Bamber, Leigh Palin, Carl Saunders, Gary Hackett and Nicky Morgan. Into the side came Tony Ellis, Lee Sandford, Tony Kelly, Dave Kevan, Paul Barnes and Noel Blake. It was a big gamble by Ball to change so much of the squad so quickly, and it did not pay off. Stoke stayed rooted to the bottom of the table and was relegated to the Third Division for the first time in 63 years."]}, {"page": "St Helens Town A.F.C.", "response": ["More recently Dave Bamber scored goals in all four divisions of the Football League with a host of different clubs, starting and ending his league career with Blackpool and Karl Ledsham is now playing his football at National League level, initially with Southport, before moving on to play for Lincoln City."]}, {"page": "Stan Ternent", "response": ["Immediately upon his appointment at Bloomfield Road, Ternent began to reshape the team, spending large sums on new players. Jack Ashurst was purchased from Sunderland for a then-club-record \u00a3132,400. Fellow newcomers included Dave Bamber, Colin Morris, Peter Noble and Tom McAlister. Despite the fresh faces, the Seasiders' fortunes didn't improve, and by early 1980 they were in the bottom half of the Third Division. Ternent was sacked on 1 February 1980, at the time becoming the club's shortest-serving manager in their history."]}, {"page": "Duncan Shearer", "response": ["He was approached by Lou Macari, who offered a club record fee of \u00a3250,000 for Shearer to join Swindon in 1988, and fill the striker position following Dave Bamber and Jimmy Quinn exiting the Wiltshire club. In his first season, he was sidelined due to an injured foot and later a groin strain, but managed to score 14 goals in the 45 league games he took part in and was the club's top scorer for that season. In the 1989\u201390 season he scored 21 league goals for Swindon as well as the winning goal in the semi-final play-offs against Blackburn Rovers, and was part of the team that won promotion at Wembley \u2013 only to be demoted due to financial irregularities at the club."]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 in English football", "response": ["*Dave Bamber (Blackpool)/Phil Stant (Mansfield Town) \u2013 26 goals"]}, {"page": "The Prescot School", "response": ["* Dave Bamber, Blackpool, Coventry City footballer"]}, {"page": "John Impey", "response": ["Impey remained at Torquay United as youth coach under first Knowles and then Dave Smith. Smith was dismissed in April 1991 after Torquay's promotion push appeared to be falling apart and Impey was appointed manager, the first to be appointed by chairman Mike Bateson, guiding them to the play-offs by finishing in seventh place in the Fourth Division. They beat Burnley in the play-off semi-final and on 31 May 1991 Impey led his side out at Wembley for the final against Blackpool. The game went to a penalty shootout, which went to sudden death. Goalkeeper Gareth Howells scored Torquay's sixth penalty, Blackpool forward Dave Bamber missed, and Torquay were in the Third Division for the first time in 19 years.
