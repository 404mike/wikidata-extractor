She is a timid yet fiery young woman with a soft Scottish accent. She often finds her husband in compromising positions with Rose, whom she nicknames 'the vampire sister', or other young females and incorrectly assumes the worst. These situations are usually prefaced in an earlier scene where she expresses jealousy over the attention that Michael's female parishioners give him. She is the first person in the series to refer to Hyacinth by the sobriquet \"the Bucket woman\", which quickly spreads to her husband and the rest of the town. "]}]}}
