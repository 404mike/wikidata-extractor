The 2010\u201311 season saw the appointment of Mark Stimson as manager, and Kamdjo found himself down the pecking order with the arrivals of new defenders Anwar Uddin, Jordan Parkes and also the re-signing of Daniel Leach. His first appearance of the season came on 18 September 2010, in a 4\u20131 home defeat to Rotherham United, coming on as a substitute for Daniel Leach. In late September 2010, defenders Daniel Leach and Darren Dennehy sustained long-term injuries, and Kamdjo was the only recognised centre back left to partner captain Anwar Uddin. This flung Clovis into first team action throughout October, before again returning to the substitutes bench in November and December. On 1 January 2011, manager Mark Stimson was dismissed as Barnet found themselves in the relegation zone, and was replaced by caretaker manager Paul Fairclough. The appointment saw Kamdjo become first choice and featured regularly in the first three months of the new year. In March 2011, Martin Allen was appointed as manager and this saw a turn in Barnet's fortunes. He scored his first career goal on 25 April 2011, with a header from Mark Byrne's cross in a 2\u20132 draw with Oxford United. Barnet went into the last league match of the season needing a final day win over Port Vale to ensure survival ahead of Lincoln City. Kamdjo featured in the 1\u20130 victory over Vale, ensuring Barnet's Football League status."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Watford F.C. season", "response": ["| 21 June 2010 || Jordan Parkes || Released || Mutual termination", "Several further players participated in youth international matches.
