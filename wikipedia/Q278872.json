In 2001, A. L. Kennedy, who was a judge in 1996, called the prize \"a pile of crooked nonsense\" with the winner determined by \"who knows who, who's sleeping with who, who's selling drugs to who, who's married to who, whose turn it is\".", "Historically, the winner of the Booker Prize had been required to be a citizen of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Republic of Ireland, or Zimbabwe. It was announced on 18 September 2013 that future Booker Prize awards would consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work was in English and published in the UK.Gompertz, Will (18 September 2013), \"Global expansion for Booker Prize\", BBC News. This change proved controversial in literary circles. Former winner A. S. Byatt and former judge John Mullan said the prize risked diluting its identity, whereas former judge A. L. Kennedy welcomed the change. Following this expansion, the first winner not from the Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwe was American Paul Beatty in 2016. Another American, George Saunders, won the following year. In 2018, publishers sought to reverse the change, arguing that the inclusion of American writers would lead to homogenisation, reducing diversity and opportunities everywhere, including in America, to learn about \"great books that haven't already been widely heralded\"."]}, {"page": "Dundee", "response": ["Dundee has a strong literary heritage, with several authors having been born, lived or studied in the city.
