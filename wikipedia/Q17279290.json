(2) Rye House Rockets were away to Newcastle Diamonds where the Rockets won away 42-36 (25 April, Karl scoring a maximum 12 points). And (3) his proudest moment (quote from Karl), helping Rye House to win against Middlesbrough Bears on 9 October 1980 with a paid 15 point maximum having had to win the last race of the match to win the National League (speedway) Championship.\nWhile racing for Rye House Rockets under the parent club Hackney Hawks, Karl also worked as an engineer for a company that made Life Support and Anaesthetic Equipment.\nIn 1988, he joined a Direct Mail Print Company and, in 2002, started his own business in this line, which is still running today.\nA keen squash player until knee-joint problems forced retirement from league competition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1977 Individual Speedway World Championship", "response": ["|Rye House || Karl Fiala || Les Collins || Mike Lanham"]}, {"page": "1979 National League season", "response": ["There was a controversial end to the season when Rye House visited Mildenhall, needing a draw to win the title. Needing a 5-1 in the last heat to tie the match, Rocket Karl Fiala's exclusion prompted team-mate Bob Garrad to withdraw from the re-run in protest. Mildenhall went on to win at bottom club Scunthorpe Saints in the last match of the season to win the title by one point."]}, {"page": "1980 National League season", "response": ["Rye House Rockets who had been pipped to the title in the previous season in the last meeting, won the title by just one point from Newcastle Diamonds to win their first National League title. Rye House had managed to retain all of their top riders from the previous season and the solid performances of Bob Garrad, Karl Fiala, Kelvin Mullarkey and Kevin Smith for the second year running made up for the disappointment of 1979. Newcastle's second place finish was remarkable bearing in mind that they had lost the league's leading rider Tom Owen to Hull Vikings in the highest division. Despite signing 1979 Riders' champion Ian Gledhill, the defending champions Mildenhall suffered after losing Melvyn Taylor and Mick Hines to other teams."]}]}}
