He is alleged to have spied for at least four different great powers, and documentary evidence indicates that he was involved in espionage activities in 1890s London among Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 circles, in Manchuria on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), and in an abortive 1918 coup d'\u00e9tat against Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik government in Moscow.Reilly disappeared in Soviet Russia in the mid-1920s, lured by Cheka's Operation Trust. British diplomat and journalist R. H. Bruce Lockhart publicised his and Reilly's 1918 exploits to overthrow the Bolshevik regime in Lockhart's 1932 book Memoirs of a British Agent. This became an international best-seller and garnered global fame for Reilly. The memoirs retold the efforts by Reilly, Lockhart, and other conspirators to sabotage the Bolshevik revolution while still in its infancy.\nThe world press made Reilly into a household name within five years of his execution by Soviet agents in 1925, lauding him as a peerless spy and recounting his many espionage adventures. Newspapers dubbed him \"the greatest spy in history\" and \"the Scarlet Pimpernel of Red Russia\". The London Evening Standard described his exploits in an illustrated serial in May 1931 headlined \"Master Spy\". Ian Fleming used him as a model for James Bond in his novels (set in the early Cold War). Reilly is considered to be \"the dominating figure in the mythology of modern British espionage\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 5", "response": ["*1925 \u2013 Secret agent Sidney Reilly, the first \"super-spy\" of the 20th century, is executed by the OGPU, the secret police of the Soviet Union."]}, {"page": "1925", "response": ["* November 5 \u2013 Secret agent Sidney Reilly is executed by the OGPU, the secret police of the Soviet Union.", "* November 5 \u2013 Sidney Reilly, Russian spy (executed) (b. c.1873)"]}, {"page": "Russo-Japanese War", "response": ["* Reilly, Ace of Spies (1983).

Nonetheless, once the Bolsheviks took Moscow, the British government began talks to try and keep them in the war effort. British diplomat Bruce Lockhart cultivated a relationship with several Soviet officials, including Leon Trotsky, and the latter approved the initial Allied military mission to secure the Eastern Front, which was collapsing in the revolutionary upheaval. Ultimately, Soviet head of state V.I. Lenin decided the Bolsheviks would settle peacefully with the Central Powers at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This separate peace led to Allied disdain for the Soviets, since it left the Western Allies to fight Germany without a strong Eastern partner.
