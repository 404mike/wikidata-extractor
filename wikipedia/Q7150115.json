With the partnership of Paul Baker and Joe Allon working well in attack, the team were in the top 10 for much of the season and in with a good chance of reaching a play-off place. Then, tragedy struck in February 1991 when Knowles was diagnosed with brain cancer and Alan Murray took over on a temporary basis. Under Murray, the team's form improved further and the club went into the final day of the season as one of several clubs that could win not just promotion but the title. A 3\u20131 win over Northampton Town was enough to secure promotion in third place; Allon scored 35 goals, and Baker and Paul Dalton also reached double figures."]}, {"page": "Andy Morrison", "response": ["Morrison was signed by Brian Horton for Huddersfield Town in the 1996\u201397 season. Horton used the \u00a32.7 million that Sheffield Wednesday had used to purchase Andy Booth from Huddersfield, to invest in Morrison as well as Marcus Stewart from Bristol Rovers and Andy Payton from Barnsley. Horton, like Allardyce before him, also made Morrison captain. Morrison scored in his debut for Huddersfield against Charlton (which Huddersfield won 2\u20130). Morrison's Huddersfield teammate Ben Thornley described him as 'the hardest person to have ever played football'. Morrison won the respect of fans 'with his braveheart style warrior performances'. A knee injury restricted Morrison's appearances for Huddersfield in the 1996\u201397 season. He was replaced by Sam Collins in a 1\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in September 1996 and did not play for Huddersfield again until a 0\u20130 draw with Manchester City in November 1996, in which he was replaced by Kevin Gray just after half time. He did not play again until April 1997 when he replaced David Beresford, at half time, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Charlton Athletic. In the 1997\u201398 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 3\u20130 defeat to West Ham United in the League Cup, in which John Hartson scored a hat trick. He also played in Huddersfield's 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon, in the FA Cup, in which Neal Ardley scored the only goal. Huddersfield's poor results in the league that season (they went nine games without a win) led to Horton being sacked. Horton was replaced by Peter Jackson, who managed to keep the team up. Morrison played in Huddersfield's first victory that season, a 3\u20131 win against Stoke City (in which Lee Richardson, Stewart and Paul Dalton scored Huddersfield's goals). He also played in Huddersfield's second win of the season, a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester City at Maine Road, in which Rob Edwards scored the winner. In the 1998\u201399 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 2\u20131 defeat to Everton, in the League Cup, in which Olivier Dacourt and Marco Materazzi scored Everton's goals and Stewart scored Huddersfield's goal. Morrison fell out with Jackson early that season when the latter decided to make Barry Horne Huddersfield captain, leading to Morrison's departure."]}, {"page": "Gary Clayton", "response": ["Clayton began his career as an apprentice at Rotherham United, but on failing to make the grade drifted into non-league football.

Thirty-six-year-old former Huddersfield, Bradford City and Newcastle United central defender Peter Jackson was drafted in as Horton's replacement in October and turned the club's fortunes around drastically. He immediately installed the experienced former Wales manager Terry Yorath as his assistant. Given a generous transfer budget by the board, Jackson captured experienced pros such as former Welsh internationals Barry Horne and David Phillips in addition to powerful local-born striker Wayne Allison from Division 1 rivals Swindon Town.

The second leg took place three days later at Home Park in Plymouth.  The home side took the lead a quarter of an hour into the match through Dwight Marshall: Burnley failed to clear a free-kick from Paul Dalton and the ball fell to Marshall who struck it past Marlon Beresford, the Burnley goalkeeper.  John Francis then levelled the score in the 29th minute, beating the goalkeeper after a \"marvellous run\".
