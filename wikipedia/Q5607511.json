He was from 1890 the Professor of Geology and Mineralogy in the Royal College of Science for Ireland, and from 1905 he became the fifth Director of the Geological Survey of Ireland.Cole was born in London, and was the son of John Jenkins Cole (1815\u20131897) an architect, and Anna Maria Josephine Smith (c.1832-1903).\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1917. He served as President of the Geographical Association 1919-1920, and in 1921 became the President of the Irish Geographical Association.\nCole supported women in their geological studies, including by teaching at Bedford College, London between 1886 and 1890. Mabel Crawford MacDowall was one of Cole's students at the Royal College of Science for Ireland. She married William Bourke Wright, a geologist. She then deployed her talents in the Geological Survey by studying fossils from the Leinster coalfield, and publishing a paper in 1920, under the Directorship of Cole (Herries Davis, 1995). Blanche Vernon was also one of Cole's students. Eventually Cole and Vernon were married, and she produced fine drawings of his thin section petrography, to illustrate his published papers (Wyse Jackson, 1989).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grenville", "response": ["*Grenville Cole (1859\u20131924), British geologist"]}, {"page": "Cole (surname)", "response": ["*Grenville Cole (1859\u20131924), English geologist"]}, {"page": "Grenville Arthur James Cole", "response": ["#REDIRECT Grenville Cole"]}, {"page": "Clare Island Survey", "response": ["The committee members were Robert Lloyd Praeger, Robert Francis Scharff, Richard Manliffe Barrington, Grenville Cole, Nathaniel Colgan and Henry William Lett.", "Nonpublishing participants John Adams (naturalist) (Marine algae); Edward Alexander Newell Arber (Geology); James Bayley Butler (Protozoa); Frederik B\u00f8rgesen (Marine algae); George W.
