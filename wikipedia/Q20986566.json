Paddy left the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1939, but Bella remained a member her entire life.  Late in World War II, Mick's parents moved to work with the New Zealand diplomatic mission in Moscow, and Mick was educated at a state school in the city, where he became fluent in Russian.The family returned to Britain when Mick was fourteen, and he studied at the University of Manchester, becoming President of the Students' Union.  He joined the CPGB in 1956, becoming known as an expert on economics and a journalist on the Morning Star, a daily newspaper associated with the party.  He wrote two books expounding party views: The Communist View, published in 1969, and Workers' Participation in the Soviet Union, which came out in 1977.In 1979, Costello was elected as the CPGB's National Industrial Organiser, building links with trade unions and becoming what the New Statesman later described as \"certainly the best-known communist in Britain, probably the cleverest, and easily the party's best linguist\".  In this role, it was suggested in several newspapers that he was working as a spy for the Soviet Union, possibly even following his father's footsteps; a charge which Costello denies, and Francis Beckett notes that his role would not be good cover for a spy, and would be unlikely to enable him to discover important secrets.Costello took part in a major debate in 1982 with Martin Jacques, editor of Marxism Today, who had criticised the shop stewards' movement.  Concerned about the party's direction, Costello left his post to become full-time industrial correspondent of the Morning Star, serving in the role through the UK miners' strike.Costello resigned from the CPGB in the mid-1980s, and started the Costello Trading Consultancy, making deals in Russia in fields from oil to fast food and artificial limbs.  He also set up an exchange scheme for Russian police and those in the Metropolitan Police.  Later in life, he returned to theoretical work, and in 2008, he joined the Communist Party of Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Costello", "response": ["* Mick Costello (born 1936), British communist activist"]}, {"page": "Tony Chater", "response": ["After being the Chair of the Communist Party of Great Britain during 1968\u201369, Chater began working full-time for the party as its head of press and publicity, and in 1974 he swapped jobs with George Matthews becoming editor of the Morning Star, a daily paper associated with the party. He attempted to get the party executive to prioritise increasing sales, with limited success. The paper, run by the People's Press Printing Society, and the party were coming into open conflict by 1982, disagreeing on approaches to the shop stewards' movement. The following year, the revisionist party leadership attempted to remove Chater's supporters from the executive of the PPPS, but the reverse occurred, and Chater's opponents were defeated instead.\"1976\u20131985: The Party and the paper attacked\", Communist Party of BritainKeith Laybourn, Marxism in Britain: dissent, decline and re-emergence 1945-c.2000, pp.116\u2013118 Chater, however, was expelled from the CPGB in January 1985.  An opposition coalesced around Chater and Mick Costello, but they were defeated at the 1987 Party Congress and subsequently founded the Communist Party of Britain.Peter Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, pp. 144\u2013145"]}, {"page": "Martin Jacques", "response": ["The transformation of Marxism Today under Jacques's leadership did not please everyone in the Communist Party, and in September 1982 Mick Costello, the party's industrial organiser, attacked Marxism Today in the pages of the party's daily newspaper, The Morning Star, after Marxism Today had carried an article by Tony Lane which was critical of some shop stewards. Kevin Halpin, another senior party figure, declared that 'The conclusion that I draw is that Martin Jacques is not a fit person to be the editor (of Marxism Today) and I shall so move'. Jacques survived censure by the party's executive committee but many have seen this episode as triggering the process which led to the eventual split in the Communist Party between hardliners and reformists. The enmity lasted, and in 1987 Tony Chater, editor of the (by then struggling) Morning Star, dismissed Marxism Today as 'pure, revisionist, right-wing gimmickry', adding that 'Real Communists can't stomach Marxism Today'."]}]}}
