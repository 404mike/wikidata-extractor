Joining as a player-coach under Jack Goldsborough, Wallace played a large part in persuading former Albion Rovers teammate Jock Stein to join the club. However, having been promoted to the Southern League, Llanelly were unsuccessful in their Football League applications and their fortunes declined as investment and interest in the project waned. Wallace also served a period as Llanelly manager."]}]}}
