But the track reached only #23 in Canada and did not reach the Top 40 of the US charts. After \"Eat Out My Heart Anymore\"'s modest success, Cavaliere would assume the lead vocals on their subsequent records, starting with its follow-up \"Good Lovin'\", originally recorded by Lemme B. Good and The Olympics in 1965, with the same arrangement and different lyrics from the original. They performed \"Good Lovin'\" on the Ed Sullivan Show. The Young Rascals version became their first Canada/USA #1. Shortly after, their eponymous debut album was released, mostly composed of garage rock renditions of folk rock (\"Just a Little\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone\"), and soul tunes (\"Mustang Sally\" and \"In the Midnight Hour\"), with only one original, the Cavaliere/Cornish penned \"Do You Feel It\".

Jones also recorded an album for the Uptown label entitled Come Go with Me which was released in 1966. Jones studied piano, and acquired an advanced classical degree primarily in the works of Bach. In 1968, she joined the cast of Catch My Soul, a rock and soul version of the play Othello, which included cast members Jerry Lee Lewis, The Blossoms, and Dr. John. During the summer of 1968, she performed in a play called Revolution, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. That winter, she joined the Los Angeles cast of Hair, the musical. Eventually, she was to meet Pam Sawyer, who asked her to write for Motown Records. Jones and Sawyer were amongst the second string of writers at Motown, but still wrote for such artists as Gladys Knight & the Pips, Commodores, The Four Tops and The Jackson 5. As Jones was also initially a singer for the label, protocol demanded a pseudonym, so for some of her co-writes she used the name LaVerne Ware (not to be confused with another Motown songwriter/producer, Leon Ware).Betts, Graham (2014).
