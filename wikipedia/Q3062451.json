After the death in 1790 of his son-in-law, George, Earl of Cardigan, created Duke of Montagu in 1766, the Manors passed to the latter's daughter Elizabeth wife of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch.

The crossing was replaced three times until it was finally demolished in 1851 as part of re-routing roads and bridges when the LSWR Company's line was built from Richmond to Windsor. Traffic between Old Windsor and Datchet now uses a southerly route along Southlea Road and crossing Albert Bridge, while a new Windsor Road was built from Datchet riverside and crossing the new Victoria Bridge. In 1742, John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu bought Datchet manor, and his family owned it until at least 1925; at one point it was owned by the head of the influential Montagu-Douglas-Scott family, Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch."]}, {"page": "Charles Montagu, 1st Duke of Manchester", "response": ["* William Montagu, 2nd Duke of Manchester (1700\u20131739), who married Lady Isabella Montagu, a daughter of John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu and Lady Mary Churchill (the youngest surviving daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough)."]}]}}
