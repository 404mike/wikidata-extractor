This time she chose to write in second person narrative, straddling between fiction and nonfiction. Hakakian walks the immigrant through the moment of arrival in America through the naturalization process. By turns lyrical and witty, Hakakian decided to write the book when the anti-immigrant sentiments reached a fever pitch in 2016. While the book appears to be written for new immigrants, it is just as much written for the native born Americans who, unaware of the privileges of their own country, must see it through the perspective of a newcomer to discover what they take for granted. Pulitzer Prize winner Jennifer Egan called the book \"striking and beautiful,\" while Anthony Kronman, Yale law professor and author of The Assault on American Excellence, called the book, \"a stirring, insightful, funny and uplifting book whose real predecessor is Alexis de Tocqueville.\" According to a review by Tunku Varadarajan for the Wall Street Journal, Hakakian's account is notable for its balance: \"She offers counsel to readers, not commandments, and although her book could be seen as a love letter to America, it is one that\u2019s been written by an exacting lover who isn\u2019t blind to this country\u2019s flaws.\" In his review for The Boston Globe, Jeff Jacoby wrote about the book, \"Lyrical and perceptive, \u201cA Beginner\u2019s Guide to America\u201d is an immigrant's love letter to the nation that took her in.

Reporting in The Times, Tunku Varadarajan agreed with Wagner that the book is a \"a microhistory of a global event\", aimed at neither those with \"Raj nostalgia or Indian Nationalism\". These responses were also supported by John Newsinger. However, Newsinger, with regards to the fear of another 1857, pointed out \"one disagreement with Wagner's discussion of this is that on occasions it [the book] seems to suggest that the massacre was the result of a misunderstanding, that if the British had not been so obsessed with the events of the 1850s then the massacre might never have taken place\"."]}, {"page": "Shashi Tharoor's Oxford Union speech", "response": ["The writer Jonathan Foreman, apart from finding the speech \"funny\", opined that for \"a nation as powerful as modern India to revel in victimhood\" was demeaning, particularly when it was to only ask for reparation from \"'one' of its conquerors\".
