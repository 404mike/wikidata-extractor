Writing in Nature in 1982, the astronomer David Hughes pointed out that William Henry Smyth had recorded reports of Jupiter's moons visible with the naked eye in exceptional conditions in particular places. Smyth wrote in 1844 that sightings of the moons typically mentioned the Apennine Mountains and Mount Etna in Italy and the Caribbean \"and various other fine-climate places as the spots where such a feat is frequently done\" by those endowed with \"visual organs of extraordinary power\". Galileo Galilei, describing his discovery using refracting telescopes of \"four planets swiftly revolving about Jupiter at differing distances and periods\" (the Galilean moons), was therefore unlikely to have been correct to write in his Sidereus Nuncius, published in 1610, that these bodies were \"known to no one before the Author recently perceived them\". By occluding Jupiter itself behind a high tree limb perpendicular to the satellites' orbital plane to prevent the planet's glare from obscuring them, one or more of the Galilean moons might be spotted in favorable conditions."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Professor David Hughes, astronomer"]}, {"page": "Universe: The Definitive Visual Guide", "response": ["Universe: The Definitive Visual Guide is a 528-page, non-fiction book by nine British co-authors (Robert Dinwiddie, Philip Eales, David Hughes, Iain Nicolson, Ian Ridpath, Giles Sparrow, Pam Spence, Carole Stott and Kevin Tildsley) with a short Foreword by Sir Martin Rees, first published in 2005."]}, {"page": "Prof David Hughes (Astronomer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Hughes (astronomer)"]}, {"page": "Astronomy Now", "response": ["The accompanying conference programme presents top speakers from the UK and overseas.

It orbits the Sun inside the innermost region of the asteroid belt at a distance of 1.5\u20132.0\u00a0AU once every 2 years and 3 months (829 days; semi-major axis of 1.73\u00a0AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 16\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. On 12 October 2026 it will pass  from Mars.
