After Christy Pym bust-up with the Peterborough United boss Darren Ferguson in a 3\u20131 loss to Reading on 14 September 2021, Pym has been excluded from the first-team picture.

Taylor also brought about a reshuffle of the playing squad ahead of the season, with eight players signing for the club -most notably Nicky Ajose, Nigel Atangana and Tom Parkes- and nine leaving -most notably Hiram Boateng joining Tisdale at MK Dons, Christy Pym leaving for Peterborough United and Jay Stansfield, son of Adam, signing for Fulham- whilst Jonathan Forte was forced to retire due to a knee injury he picked up the previous season."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["The Grecians fared slightly better in October despite an opening 1\u20130 away loss at Wycombe Wanderers after a late goal from Adebayo Akinfenwa. City finally picked up their first point at home on 8 October with a goalless draw with Grimsby Town in which goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik didn't feature on the starting line-up for only the second time in over 50 league matches. Instead, Christy Pym featured in goal and would stay in the starting lineup for months to come. In contrast to the Grecians' poor start to the season, City thumped Barnet 4\u20131 in the following fixture away from home. The League Two top scorer at the time John Akinde opened the scoring for the opposition before Jake Taylor equalized just before half-time. After the break, City scored another three goals while former Grecian Alex Nicholls failed to find the back of net. Despite this heavy win, City once again lost at home the following week to Cambridge United to two early goals, with Joel Grant scoring a consolation goal towards the end of the match. Like their previous away fixture, the Grecians picked up another strong win at Morecambe, with first-half goals from David Wheeler, Joel Grant and Lee Holmes. By the end of October, the Grecians had earned 16 points, 15 of these away from home and stood at 19th in the league table, six points below the play-off places and one point above the relegation zone."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["Luton moved to the top of the table after a 4\u20131 win away to Exeter City. Collins opened the scoring for Luton from close range in the eighth minute, before Exeter equalised when Jake Taylor curled a shot into the top corner on 21 minutes. Potts restored Luton's lead shortly after half-time, before Hylton made it 3\u20131 with a powerful shot past goalkeeper Christy Pym in the 52nd minute, and Cornick finished the scoring three minutes later with a tap-in from close range from Hylton's cross. Luton's run of four successive league wins ended after drawing 0\u20130 away to Crawley Town, who had lost their last four home matches. Cotter's loan at Hitchin was extended for another month. A 3\u20130 defeat at home to Coventry City saw Luton's nine-match unbeaten run in the league come to an end, with the visitors taking the lead in the 17th minute through Marc McNulty with a header. Coventry scored twice in second-half stoppage time, the first coming after Rea was sent off for a foul on McNulty, with Jordan Shipley scoring the resulting free kick, and the second was scored by Duckens Nazon four minutes later to finish the scoring. Luton progressed to the second round of the EFL Trophy as Southern Group F winners after a 2\u20131 win away to AFC Wimbledon, in which they took the lead in the 12th minute when Andrew Shinnie's shot beat goalkeeper Joe McDonnell. Lyle Taylor equalised for AFC Wimbledon two minutes later with a shot into the bottom corner from close range, before Shinnie scored the winner on 72 minutes with a side-footed shot into the bottom corner."]}, {"page": "2017 EFL League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Three minutes into the second half, Osayi-Samuel struck a shot wide of the Exeter goal.  In the 50th minute, a half-volley from Vassell from a tight angle was saved by the Exeter goalkeeper Christy Pym.  In the 57th minute Exeter's Grant was replaced by Reuben Reid before Troy Brown limped off, with Pierce Sweeney coming on as a substitute. In the 59th minute, Cullen received the first yellow card of the game.  Pym then caught Mellor's header from a corner.  Blackpool made their second substitution of the game in the 62nd minute when Ian Black came on for Payne.  Two minutes later, Cullen put Blackpool back into the lead.  Potts made a run into the Exeter penalty area and crossed the ball: Pym deflected it with his foot only for Cullen to finish it with an outstretched leg.  In the 71st minute, Exeter made their final personnel change of the afternoon with Lee Holmes replacing Craig Woodman.  Danns shot then flew over the Exeter crossbar and with fifteen minutes to go, Cullen was replaced by Jordan Flores.  In the 78th minute, Reid's shot from the edge of the Blackpool box went just wide.  Late pressure from Exeter failed to produce any goals, and despite five minutes of injury time, the match ended 2\u20131 to Blackpool who were promoted to League One.", "|GK ||30||Christy Pym"]}]}}
