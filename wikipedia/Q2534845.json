Fleck played as a striker from 1983 until 2001, notably in the Scottish Premier League for Rangers, in England for Chelsea in the FA Premier League, and for Norwich City in the Football League.\nFleck also played for Bolton Wanderers, Bristol City and Reading. Fleck gained four caps for Scotland and featured in the 1990 World Cup. Fleck went into management in 2000 with Dr. Kenny Muir with a spell as player-managers of Non-league Gorleston, and later having a four-year spell in charge of Diss Town. Fleck was made a member of Norwich City's Hall of Fame. Since retiring as a player, he has worked in football management, but is now a teaching assistant in Norwich.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich City F.C.", "response": ["|1992|| Robert Fleck"]}, {"page": "Neil Shipperley", "response": ["In the inaugural Premier League season of 1992\u201393, Shipperley made his professional debut towards the end of the campaign. On 10 April, he came on as a 65th-minute substitute for Robert Fleck in a 1\u20130 loss at his future club Southampton, and two days later on his first start and first game at Stamford Bridge he scored their last goal in a 4\u20132 win against Wimbledon."]}, {"page": "Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)", "response": ["Walker quit Norwich in January 1994, following a long running feud with Chairman Robert Chase (mainly centring on Chase's habit of selling off the club's key players without consulting his manager first - for example Robert Fleck to Chelsea just after Walker's appointment), to become manager of Everton, with Everton having to pay substantial compensation to Norwich to secure his services. Walker failed, however, to meet the high expectations of a bigger club. Although Walker oversaw an extraordinary last day escape from relegation with Everton securing a 3\u20132 home victory over Wimbledon (Everton had been 2-0 down, and 2-1 down at half time), Everton made a disastrous start to the 1994/95 season, failing to win a single league game until November. With Everton bottom of the table and having made their worst start to a league season, Walker was sacked having spent just ten months in charge and recording only six league wins, leaving him with the worst record of any post-war Everton manager. Walker was nicknamed the 'Silver Fox' during his time at Goodison. However, there were a few positive aspects of his reign at the club. They included the signing of Anders Limpar in March 1994, the gamble on Daniel Amokachi and the decision to bring the controversial Rangers striker Duncan Ferguson to Everton on loan, a gamble which ultimately paid off after Walker's departure with Joe Royle signing the Scot on a permanent basis."]}]}}
