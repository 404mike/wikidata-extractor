Something of a journeyman player, he has tended to play for teams in his local area around the Midlands and Southern England.\nRichards started his career at West Bromwich Albion in 1997, and failed to establish himself at the club in four years. After two years with Bristol Rovers he switched to Stevenage Borough. In 2004, he signed with Woking, and after a highly successful two years was snapped up by Peterborough United. In 2007, he joined Kidderminster Harriers, where he stayed for two years before he signed with Cheltenham Town. In the summer of 2010 he was signed to Port Vale, before moving on to Burton Albion the following year, and to Oxford United and then Tamworth in 2013. He signed with Sutton Coldfield Town in July 2014 and Stourbridge in September 2015, before returning to Sutton Coldfield Town in December 2017. The following summer he joined Rushall Olympic via Hednesford Town.

Five wins in five for September saw Adam's gifted the League Two Manager of the Month award, his team also boasting five clean sheets.

He signed the contract within days, saying it was time to \"finish the job I started\". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals \u2013 both scoring and conceding \u2013 Adams decided to give his players \"a kick up the backside\" by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Rob Kozluk.

He joined Stanley again on loan during the 2006\u201307 season, but failed to displace Ian Dunbavin as the club's first choice goalkeeper.

Yet he managed to force himself back into contention with an impressive strike to seal a 2\u20131 win over Macclesfield Town on 5 March, after coming into the match as a late substitute. After Gannon left the club just two weeks later, Dodds admitted that he probably would have left the club had Gannon remained in charge much longer.

With Fraser and Adams leaving the club, new boss Jim Gannon handed Richards the captaincy in February 2011. On 26 February, he marked his return from injury with a goal against Aldershot Town in a 2\u20131 win\u00a0\u2013 his first goal in three months. On 29 March he scored his 100th career goal, helping Vale to beat Lincoln City 2\u20131.

After scoring on the opening day against Crawley Town, Richards then spent a month on the sidelines with an ankle injury. He made his return to the starting eleven against Plymouth Argyle on 10 September, only to end up with a straight red card and three match ban for an incident with Warren Feeney, an incident the striker described as 'handbags'. He returned to the first team on 1 October for only his fourth appearance of the campaign, and bagged both of Vale's goals against Rotherham United. However, after a further six games he was sidelined again due to a recurrence of his ankle injury, and had to wait until December before he returned to action. The injury required surgery to fully heal, however Richards chose to postpone the operation in order to try to help the \"Valiants\" into an unlikely play-off spot. Despite the club entering administration in March, Richards refused the opportunity to jump ship to promotion hopefuls Crawley Town. The administrators also rejected a loan offer from Shrewsbury Town. He finished the season with 17 goals in 36 games, thereby becoming the club's top scorer for the fourth season in a row.

This final man-of-the-match winning performance was enough to convince Gannon to 'fight tooth and nail' to keep Pope at the club beyond the initial month long spell. Indeed, his loan spell was extended into a second month. His third goal for the club came on 22 March, and was enough to rescue a point at home to Hereford United for caretaker-manager Mark Grew. Following this his loan deal was extended into a third month. However the loan spell was terminated three weeks early following a change of circumstances \u2013 parent club Rotherham had dropped out of the play-offs and manager Ronnie Moore had departed. Pope remained hopeful of a permanent switch in the summer, and a move away from the Don Valley Stadium seemed inevitable after new manager Andy Scott omitted him from United's pre-season tour of Portugal. He got his wish in August, as he switched to Port Vale on a free transfer.

Lewis Haldane was rushed into hospital after being bitten by an insect during a training session, forcing him to miss the first half of the season.

Gannon had previously told the press his staff were 'underqualified', though insisted any changes would be 'implemented at a later stage' and that Horsfield was a 'great assistant'. This came on the same day that local paper The Sentinel ran an editorial that questioned his loan signings, his decision to drop Gary Roberts and branded his tactics and team selections as baffling. After Horsfield was told to stay away from the club for two weeks he was invited back to his assistant role as before, with no disciplinary action taken against either party. As the club fell to seventh in the tale, Gannon made another loan signing by bringing Dominic Blizzard in from Bristol Rovers. Results continued to go against the Vale though, as on 19 March they lost 3\u20130 at Accrington Stanley, and as a result dropped out of the play-off zone for the first time in the season. Ugly post-match scenes at the Crown Ground saw Geohaghon confront fans who singled him out for abuse, whilst Gannon was ushered quietly out of the back door. Roberts told the media \"I don't think the manager likes me and, to be honest, I don't like him\". Rumours circulated that Gannon would soon be on his way out.

Next up was a trip to St Mary's for a Carling Cup First Round fixture with Southampton.  Despite a spirited performance, the Gulls were unable to overcome a strong Saints side and had to accept a 4\u20131 defeat as well as the fact that Torquay had now gone ten years without reaching the Second Round of the League Cup.  However, the Gulls did not have to wait much longer for their first victory of the season and it was to be a particularly enjoyable one for the Torquay fans as it came at the home of Paul Buckle's new side Bristol Rovers.  Goals from Taiwo Atieno and Rene Howe in the first fifteen minutes was enough to secure all three points at the Memorial Stadium, despite Byron Anthony snatching one back for Rovers in the second half.
