Wagstaff was not a regular in the Sheffield United first team until the latter stages of season 1962-63 when he netted four goals in 15 league appearances, including the winner in a 1\u20130 victory at Birmingham City on 23 March 1963.In 1963-64, he scored 9 times in 37 league matches, which was the best scoring spell of his career. Many believed that his apparent lack of pace and power reduced the effectiveness of such a skilled player.\nWhen his brother Barry made the Blades first team, the pair were often in and out of the side. By the time United were relegated to Division Two in 1968, Tony's appearances had become very limited and the Wagstaffs were sold to Reading for a combined fee of \u00a317,500. Tony had played 157 competitive games (138 league games) for Sheffield United scoring 21 (19 league) goals in all.\nTony stayed at Reading until 1973, making 185 competitive appearances (166 league games) and scoring 6 times (5 league goals) for the Royals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wagstaff", "response": ["* Tony Wagstaff (born 1944), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*First League Substitute: Tony Wagstaff: replacing Alan Birchenall at Craven Cottage v Fulham on 8 September 1965"]}]}}
