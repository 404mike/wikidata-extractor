A fifteenth-century chronicle now held by Oxford University names Ecgberht's wife as Redburga who was supposedly a relative of Charlemagne who he married when he was banished to Francia, but this is dismissed by academic historians in view of its late date.The chronicle (Hardy, Vol III, No. 326) describes Ecgberht's wife as \"Redburga regis Francorum sororia\" (sister or sister-in-law of the Frankish Emperor). Some nineteenth-century historians cited the manuscript to identify Redburga as Ecgberht's wife, such W. G. Searle in his 1897 Onomasticon Anglo-Saxonicum and (as R\u00e6dburh) in his 1899 Anglo-Saxon Bishops, Kings and Nobles. Other historians of that time were sceptical, such as William Hunt, who did not mention Redburga in his article about Ecgberht in the original Dictionary of National Biography in 1889 (Hunt, \"Egbert\", pp. 619\u2013620). In the twentieth century, popular genealogists and historians have followed Searle in naming Redburga as Ecgberht's wife, but academic historians ignore her when discussing Ecgberht, and Janet Nelson's 2004 article on his son \u00c6thelwulf in the Online Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that his mother's name is unknown. \u00c6thelwulf is their only known child."]}, {"page": "Edward the Black Prince", "response": ["The Victorian historian William Hunt, author of Prince Edward's biography in the Dictionary of National Biography (1889), relying on Froissart as a source, wrote that when the bishop (who was the most responsible for the surrender) was brought before the Prince, the Prince told him that his head should be cut off (Lancaster persuaded him not to carry out the deed), but that the city was nevertheless pillaged and burnt, and that 3,000 persons of all ranks and ages were massacred.
