The Dutch were criticised for their rough play, and some thought Webb was generous for not showing any red cards to the Dutch players until ten minutes before the end of extra time. Webb later conceded that had he had a better viewing angle of a high challenge from Nigel de Jong he would have sent him off, and De Jong later admitted he was \"lucky\" to only receive a yellow card. FIFA president Sepp Blatter defended Webb, noting that it was \"not easy\" to control such a match. Former Premier League referee Jeff Winter said Webb \"had a superb game\" while Scotland's Alan Hansen condemned the Dutch, saying that, \"Webb tried to make the game flow but on this occasion he was left with no choice.\" The British Referees' Association said \"it would be almost impossible to disagree with any of the bookings he issued\", while former FA Cup final referee Keith Hackett noted that \"anyone who criticises the officials lacks the knowledge and experience of someone who has refereed\" and called on FIFA to punish the Dutch players who castigated Webb to the press."]}, {"page": "FA Cup Final referees", "response": ["|1989||Joe Worrall||Mike PeckArthur Smith||Jeff Winter", "|2004||Jeff Winter||Roger EastAntony Green||Matt Messias|||"]}, {"page": "2004 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The match was refereed by Jeff Winter.

United now held a comfortable advantage and Millwall struggled to find a way back into the match.

He was then set to sign for Northampton Town, however, Kevin Wilson was sacked and the club's plans to sign the defender were halted.

He made his debut for the club in the 1\u20130 away win at Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy on 16 October 2001. He was sent-off in his third game for Bury in the 5\u20131 defeat to Brentford. Stuart scored his only goal for Bury on 22 December 2001, in the 1\u20131 draw at home to Blackpool. Bury went 1\u20130 down in the first-half, before Stuart equalised in the 53rd minute, with a shot that went in off the post. During his 18-month spell with Bury, Stuart was a first-team regular, making 61 appearances in the Third Division, scoring once. Bury finished seventh in the league during the 2002\u201303 season, qualifying for the play-offs. He also gained a total of four red cards and four yellows in the 18-months he was with Bury, including a red card in the 2002\u201303 play-off semi-final first leg against AFC Bournemouth. Stuart was allegedly elbowed in the face by Wade Elliott, which resulted in his nose being broken and Stuart reacting by grabbing Elliott's shirt. Referee, Jeff Winter, adjudged Stuart had thrown a punch, whilst Andy Preece criticised Stuart for raising his arms to another player, defended him saying \"I can't see why he thinks Jamie has punched him in the face...the explanation from the ref doesn't add up with what you see on the video.\""]}, {"page": "Keren Barratt", "response": ["His career climaxed with the 1993 FA Cup Final between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley on 15 May 1993.FA Cup Final 1993: soccerbase.com website.
