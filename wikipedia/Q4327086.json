He also wrote on the subjects of theosophy and occultism. He was an associate of Aleister Crowley and the publisher of the early works of Pamela Hansford Johnson and Dylan Thomas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["Biographer Lawrence Sutin stated that \"blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley's writings\". Sutin thought Crowley \"a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst John Bull racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries\", noting that he \"embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society, coupled with a fascination with people of colour\". Crowley is said to have insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Benjamin Neuburg, using anti-Semitic slurs, and he had mixed opinions about Jewish people as a group. Although he praised their \"sublime\" poetry and stated that they exhibited \"imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity\", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jewish people to exhibit \"avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest\". He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a \"spiritual superiority\" to the English, and praised Muslims for exhibiting \"manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect\"."]}, {"page": "Choronzon", "response": ["Crowley states that he and Victor Benjamin Neuburg evoked Choronzon in Bousaada, Algeria in December 1909.Vision and the Voice, Tenth Aethyr. In Crowley's account, it is unclear whether Choronzon was evoked into an empty Solomonic triangle while Crowley sat elsewhere, or whether Crowley himself was the medium into which the demon was invoked. Nearly all writers except Lawrence Sutin take him to mean the latter. In the account, Choronzon is described as changing shape, which is read variably as an account of an actual metamorphosis, a subjective impression of Neuburg's, or fabrication on Crowley's part."]}, {"page": "Steyning", "response": ["*Victor Benjamin Neuburg occultist and poet, proprietor of the Vine Press"]}, {"page": "Victor B.
