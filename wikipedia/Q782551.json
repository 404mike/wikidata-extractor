He added, however, that \"it still is the Burton-Gaiman-Dal\u00ed \u2013 amusement park we are about to enter\". In the same statement, it was revealed that the album would be a theme album and \"mood changes seem to be more present than ever before\", and the orchestration demos he had received from Pip Williams were described as \"beautiful, twisted, tribal and cinematic stuff\". In the Finnish version of the statement, it was also revealed that a few songs will not get any orchestrations at all, differing from their latest album on which all songs had the background orchestra.", "The new album's cover art and its title, Endless Forms Most Beautiful, were revealed on December 22, and the album was released on March 27, 2015, produced by Tero \"TeeCee\" Kinnunen. The title for Endless Forms Most Beautiful was taken from the writings of English naturalist Charles Darwin. The album features the participation of London's The Metro Voices choir group, London's Young Musicians Children's Choir, and the Orchestre De Grandeur, led by the esteemed orchestral arranger Pip Williams, who teaches music and music technology at the London College of Music. Professor Richard Dawkins not only narrates the introduction to the album's opener, \"Shudder Before the Beautiful\", but also the album's closer, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", which takes its name from his 2009 book on evolution. In its first week, the album sold 18,342 copies in the US and debuted at 34 on the Billboard 200, making it Nightwish's third album (after Dark Passion Play and Imaginaerum) to chart in this category. In the Czech Republic, the album debuted atop the charts and received gold-status after just two days. The album charted in the top 10 in other countries as well, including Finland, Netherlands, Poland, Austria, and Mexico. To promote the album's release, the band embarked on an Endless Forms Most Beautiful World Tour, which started on April 9, 2015 in New York City and ended on October 9, 2016 in Saitama, Japan."]}, {"page": "The Moody Blues", "response": ["The Moody Blues toured the US and Europe during much of 1979. A live CD The Moody Blues Live in Seattle 1979 during the Octave tour of a concert at Seattle Center Coliseum recorded on 25 May 1979 was later issued in 2013. By 1980 they were ready to record again, this time bringing in producer Pip Williams. Moraz was retained as the band's permanent keyboardist, though Pinder had originally understood that he would continue to record even if not touring with the band. Pinder took legal action to prevent the new Moody Blues album from reaching the public without his contributions, but he was not successful, and ultimately, he never returned to the fold. Nevertheless, when released in 1981, Long Distance Voyager was a colossal success, reaching No. 1 on Billboard and going Top 5 in the UK. The album yielded two hits, \"The Voice\", (No. 15 US) written by Hayward, and \"Gemini Dream\", (No. 12 US) written by Hayward and Lodge. John Lodge's \"Talking out of Turn\" also charted in the US, reaching No. 65. Edge provided \"22,000 Days\" (featuring Thomas as lead voice with Hayward and Lodge) while Thomas' contributions were the final portion of the set with his singing on the final two songs; \"Painted Smile\", \"Reflective Smile\" (a poem narrated by a DJ friend of the band) and \"Veteran Cosmic Rocker\". By now, the mellotron had long been set aside as their primary keyboard instrument on their studio albums and the band embraced a more modern, less symphonic approach, though still retaining a lush keyboard-led sound as Moraz gave a more contemporary edge. In live concerts, the mellotron was still used heavily by Moraz until the mid-1980s, including on songs that did not originally feature it."]}, {"page": "Status Quo (band)", "response": ["From 1977 onwards, the band's sound became more polished as they began to employ outside producers.

Howe's second LP Harry was released in the UK in 1975 on RCA, for which the title track received an Ivor Novello Award (only the second female recording artist to achieve this) and became enduringly popular on BBC Radio 2. Also in 1974, Howe appeared on film as the singer during the title credits of the British sex farce, Can You Keep It Up for a Week?. RCA released a follow-up album, Silent Mother Nature in 1976, winning Folk Album of the Year from the Sunday Times. A single was released entitled \"Until The Morning Comes\" written by the Scottish singer/guitarist Dave Kelly and Ray McRiner, and was performed on LWT's Supersonic. The following year, the title tracks of both RCA albums were re-released (together with the aforementioned single) on the EP The Truth of the Matter, and was one of the Top 75 selling EPs of 1977. Throughout that year Howe produced and sang the songs for BBC Television's That's Life!. Howe's fourth album came two years later, Dragonfly Days, released on Ariola Records. Dragonfly Days featured the \"Creme de La Creme\" of English session musicians including drummer Peter Boita and the guitarist Alan Parker amongst others. Ariola also released singles by Howe prior to and following the album, some of which are not included on the LP, and promoted as far away as South America.
