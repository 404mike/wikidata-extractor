The next year, he would read an abridgement of Matthew Hollis' biography of poet and literary critic Edward Thomas, best known for his poem Adelstrop, on BBC Radio 4's series Book of the Week. In his third collaboration with BBC Radio 4, Menzies was the voice of John Charrington's Wedding (2012), the second episode of a five-part series titled Ghost Stories of E Nesbit. 2013's three-part radio drama, commissioned by BBC Radio 4, saw Menzies portray British writer and National Trust supporter James Lees-Milne, opposite Victoria Hamilton as novelist Nancy Mitford. The series consisted of three interconnected plays, based upon his WWII era journals, cataloging the decline of the English country house and titled Sometimes into the Arms of God, The Unending Battle, and What England Owes. That same year, he would star in BBC Radio 3's drama Serious Money, adapted for radio by Emma Harding from Caryl Churchill's play of the same name, and BBC Radio 4's political drama Every Duchess In England, based upon Parliament's response to England's financial crisis of 1931."]}, {"page": "Eric Gregory Award", "response": ["*1999: Ross Cogan, Matthew Hollis, Helen Ivory, Andrew Pidoux, Owen Sheers, Dan Wyke"]}, {"page": "Costa Book Awards", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Matthew HollisNow All Roads Lead to France: The Last Years of Edward Thomas"]}, {"page": "1999 in poetry", "response": ["* Eric Gregory Award: Ross Cogan, Matthew Hollis, Helen Ivory, Andrew Pidoux, Owen Sheers, Dan Wyke"]}, {"page": "1971 in poetry", "response": ["* Matthew Hollis, English poet, literary biographer and editor"]}, {"page": "Bloodaxe Books", "response": ["*Strong Words: modern poets on modern poetry, edited by W.
