During his time at Rangers, he had two loan spells at Dundee: one during the 2008\u201309 season, and one in 2010, making 32 league appearances for the club. He joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle in July 2011, and made 57 league appearances in a two-year spell at the club, featuring in the 2012\u201313 PFA SPL Team of the Year, before joining Birmingham City in July 2013. He spent time on loan at Rotherham United in 2015\u201316, and then played on loan for Hibernian in 2016\u201317. After a loan spell during the 2017\u201318 season, Shinnie signed for Luton Town in June 2018.\nShinnie played at under-19 level for Scotland on four occasions in 2007, before making three appearances for the under-21 side in 2009 and 2010. He made his full international debut for Scotland in November 2012, in a 2\u20131 win over Luxembourg.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.", "response": ["* Andrew Shinnie (Scotland) 2011\u20132013"]}, {"page": "Lee Clark (footballer)", "response": ["Clark endured a difficult start to his managerial reign, with a draw and two losses in a row for his first three games in the Championship. His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5\u20130 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March. Despite receiving criticism from fans for alleged poor management skills regarding public fallouts with Nikola Zigic, Clark has been praised for introducing academy players into the first team squad, players including Jack Butland, Will Packwood, Mitch Hancox, Callum Reilly, Koby Arthur and Reece Hales. Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4\u20130 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1\u20130 wins against Bristol City and Leeds. After finishing the season in 12th place, 7 points off the play-offs, Clark made his first signings for the 2013\u201314 Championship season with Darren Randolph, Andrew Shinnie and Lee Novak all signing on free transfers, whilst Olly Lee's loan was made permanent. The 2013\u201314 season started poorly again for Clark, with Birmingham winning a single game in the league against Yeovil Town as the Blues made their worst start to a league season for 25 years. Despite poor results in the league (including an 18 home match run without a league win) and the removal from the coaching staff of Clark's right hand men Derek Fazackerley and Terry McDermott, Clark managed to keep Birmingham City in the Championship with an injury time equaliser from Paul Caddis in the final game of the 2013\u201314 season against Bolton, the 2\u20132 result being enough to keep the team up on goal difference."]}, {"page": "List of Aberdonians", "response": ["*Andrew Shinnie (born 1989), footballer"]}, {"page": "Scottish Youth Cup", "response": ["* Andrew Shinnie (2007, 2008)"]}, {"page": "Rangers F.C.

In the opening game of the season, he scored in a 2\u20132 draw against St Mirren and shortly after, in the second round of the Scottish League Cup, he scored with a header during a 1\u20131 draw against Stenhousemuir \u2013 a game in which Inverness won on a penalty shoot-out. A few weeks later, on 19 October 2012, Mckay scored twice in a 4\u20131 win over Dundee, and from 19 October to 10 November, he hit four goals in three games. Soon after, he scored the winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Celtic. After the match, Manager Terry Butcher claimed that the success was 'magnificent'. In the Highland derby, fourth-round of the Scottish Cup, Inverness CT and Ross County required a replay to separate them, but Mckay grabbed the eventual winner in the replay. At the end of November, he was awarded the SPL \u2013 Player of the Month, along with Butcher and Doran, who won the 'Manager of the Month' and 'Young Player of the Month' respectively. A week later, Mckay scored his first career hat-trick, in a 4\u20134 draw against Dundee United. Between 24 November 2012 and 26 December 2012, he notched ten more goals (including the Scottish Cup) over seven consecutive games. This outstanding level of performance and goalscoring led to him speculatively being linked with English clubs. The transfer rumours led to Butcher offering him a new contract. The manager also stated that Mckay was happy to remain at the club. Furthermore, Butcher claimed his striker was worth more than Celtic's Gary Hooper. On 19 January 2013, Mckay grabbed his first goal of the calendar year and then scored again in a 3\u20130 win over Aberdeen. In March 2013, he ended any transfer speculation by signing a new two-year deal. Terry Butcher expressed his delight to the media at securing Mckay's future at Inverness. He 'celebrated' his contract extension soon after, in the Highland derby, by slotting home the winning goal from a penalty in a 2\u20131 win. He led the top-scorer charts for much of the season and had put himself in the  running to win the 'Player of the Year' award. Had he done so, Mckay would have become the first man to win it (from a team other than Rangers or Celtic) since 1990, when Jim Bett claimed the award. Ultimately, however, Mckay wasn't included in the shortlist; instead, teammate Andrew Shinnie was one of the four nominees."]}, {"page": "Graeme Shinnie", "response": ["Shinnie is the younger brother of fellow footballer Andrew Shinnie, who joined him at Inverness in 2011.
