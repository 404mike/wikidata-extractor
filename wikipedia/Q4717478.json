He joined the Army and appeared for their select team in charity matches, while also finding time to play for Partick Thistle in wartime competitions when possible. This brought his total number of appearances for the club to 297 with 33 goals, although his official SFL and Scottish Cup totals were less than half of that (130/13). After playing for Portadown, he returned to Holytown United as trainer until the club folded a year later.McSpadyen represented Scotland twice, also playing in one unofficial wartime match, and making three appearances for the Scottish Football League XI, all between 1938 and 1941.", "link_mentions": {}}}
