They represented business (Heseltine) and politics (Balcarres) as well as the art world. Balcarres gravitated to the position of chairman of a provisional committee, and Herringham provided some working funds, but there were tensions: between Herringham and her cousin Witt, and over the participation of other women. At the first General Meeting of the Fund in November, Fry moved a protest amendment, seconded by Herringham, aimed at the exclusion of key early founders from the executive committee. Balcarres tried hard to smooth over the schism between Witt and Isidore Spielmann on one side, and Fry, MacColl and Phillips on the other. With these issues barely contained backstage, Heseltine set out to acquire the Rokeby Venus for the National Gallery, London, the purchase that established the Fund in British cultural life.

He was a member of the Gloucester Committee of the Three Choirs Festival. He often exhibited his paintings at the Royal Academy and other venues. Gambier-Parry assumed the role of family archivist. He was reluctant to sell the collection of paintings and other art objects that his father had collected over his lifetime. (His younger son Mark similarly attempted to avoid the attention of dealers and instead bequeathed the Gambier-Parry collection intact to the Courtauld Institute of Art.) The Gambier-Parry archive included an 1897 inventory of the estate that Ernest Gambier-Parry compiled and was used in the research of the collection for the Courtauld Institute. His inventory documented prominent members of the art world who were friends of his father and viewed the collection. They included two presidents of the Royal Academy: Sir Frederic Leighton and Sir Edward John Poynter. The former selected works from the collection in 1888 to show in the Royal Academy's Winter Exhibition. After his father's death, Gambier-Parry extended invitations to art experts to view the collection at Highnam. The visits occurred primarily in the 1910s and 1920s. Gambier-Parry documented the visits and the impressions or detailed appraisals offered by the experts. The visitors included Professor Charles John Holmes, director of the National Gallery; Sir Claude Phillips, curator of the Wallace Collection; Roger Eliot Fry; Bernard Berenson; Dr. Raymond van Marle, author of The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, William George Constable of the National Gallery, and historian Welbore St. Clair Baddeley."]}, {"page": "Exposition des primitifs flamands \u00e0 Bruges", "response": ["*Claude Phillips, Impressions of the Bruges Exhibition, in The Fortnightly Review, 1902"]}, {"page": "Dorothy Hazard", "response": ["During the English Civil War, Bristol was besieged by the Royalist troops of Sir Ralph Hopton.
