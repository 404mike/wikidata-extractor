He later publicly declared that \"the Turks and Kurds have declared a holy war on the Armenians and have vowed to exterminate them.\" He also described the Van massacres and those which followed across Turkey as an \"organized, systematic attempt to wipe out the Armenians.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northfield Mount Hermon School", "response": ["* Ernest Yarrow, 1897, director of the Near East Foundation"]}, {"page": "Yarrow (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Ernest Yarrow (1876\u20131939), British-American missionary"]}, {"page": "Varagavank", "response": ["The exact date of the burning of the monastery is not known for certain.
