In his book \"What Gospel Standard Baptists Believe\", J.H. Gosden clarifies that this article is not meant to minimize the sin of unbelief. He understood this article to be a denial that man is duty bound to believe \"each individual is himself\" included in the redemption work of Christ and he affirmed that man is \"inexcusable in his unbelief\" against God's revealed word and works.J.H. Gosden, Commentary on the Gospel Standard Baptist Articles of Faith, (pg. 129-130) The Baptist pastor William Styles reasoned that duty-faith blends the covenant of works with the covenant of grace and makes faith a work of the law.William Styles, A Manual of Faith and Practice , (pg. 230) W. Kitchen reasoned in a Strict Baptists magazine that duty-faith would imply a universal design in the atonement by calling on all persons to exercise a faith which grants them to believe Jesus gave himself for them.W.
