Under Harry Storer, appointed manager in 1945, the club won the Football League South wartime league and reached the semifinal of the first post-war FA Cup. Two years later they won their third Second Division title, conceding only 24 goals in the 42-game season. Storer's successor Bob Brocklebank, though unable to stave off relegation in 1950, brought in players who made a major contribution to the club's successes of the next decade. When Arthur Turner took over as manager in November 1954, he made them play closer to their potential, and a 5\u20131 win on the last day of the 1954\u201355 season confirmed them as champions. In their first season back in the First Division, Birmingham achieved their highest league finish of sixth place. They also reached the FA Cup final, losing 3\u20131 to Manchester City in the game notable for City's goalkeeper Bert Trautmann playing the last 20 minutes with a broken bone in his neck. The following season the club lost in the FA Cup semifinal for the third time since the war, this time beaten 2\u20130 by Manchester United's \"Busby Babes\"."]}, {"page": "Bradford City A.F.C.", "response": ["*  Bob Brocklebank (1961\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "Chesterfield F.C.", "response": ["|Bob Brocklebank|| English||1945\u20131948"]}, {"page": "Hull City A.F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Bob Brocklebank||||March 1955 \u2013 May 1961 ||302||113||71||118||37.41"]}]}}
