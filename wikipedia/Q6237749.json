It was shot in Sydney, Australia, and follows the misadventures of the band members (or rather, stuntmen in balaclavas pretending to be them) as they try to escape from the police.  It was intended that the stuntmen wear masks of the band members to make it appear that the band were performing their own stunts, but the masks created for the video were such poor representations that the decision was made to use balaclavas instead.Conversation with the director, 1997 The video also features cameos by stunt choreographer Grant Page as a helicopter pilot, and actor Noah Taylor as a truck passenger.

The accompanying music video, directed by John Hardwick, does not feature the band members themselves in any way, being made up of footage from a 2002 BBC documentary titled Warship, exploring the lives of those serving on a warship.

Albarn described the video as \"the antithesis of the 'Top Gun' image of the American military machine\", and added that the video \"focuses on the loneliness of somebody working on an aircraft carrier and the fact that a six-month tour of duty means that relationships break down and children go without their parents. That's the reality of it\". The visual premiered online on 7 April 2003.
