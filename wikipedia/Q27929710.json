He sustained a serious knee injury in a reserve match against Manchester United, and, after leaving Newcastle, he played semi\u2011professional football for Gateshead, while working in Newcastle City Council's housing department. Bell was also manager, director and chairman at Gateshead.During his time at the Montagu and North Fenham boys football club in the late 1970s, Bell was sexually abused by Newcastle coach George Ormond. When Bell was working with finding homes for refugee children in the late 1990s and saw Ormond lurking, he decided to secretly record a confession from the coach. Bell was among seven former players at Montagu and North Fenham who gave evidence in a 2002 trial of Ormond that led to his conviction on 13 indecency charges. In November 2016, amid the United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal, Bell waived his right to anonymity and accused Newcastle of attempting a cover-up.Bell left his council job after he was made to find new homes for paedophiles. He suffered from alcohol abuse, had three divorces and attempted suicide three times. He was convicted in 2009 of violence against his wife. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gateshead F.C.", "response": ["|2002\u20132004||Derek Bell"]}, {"page": "Derek Bell", "response": ["Derek Bell may refer to:", "* Derek Bell (baseball) (born 1968), American baseball player", "* Derek Bell (footballer, born 1956), English former professional footballer", "* Derek Bell (footballer, born 1963), English former professional footballer", "* Derek Bell (racing driver) (born 1941), British racing car driver", "* Derek Bell (musician) (1935\u20132002), Northern Irish musician and composer", "* Derek Bell (physician), professor of acute medicine"]}, {"page": "Ian Bogie", "response": ["Bogie was confirmed as the new Gateshead manager on 4 May 2007.
