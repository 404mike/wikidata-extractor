Many authors credit his reports as the catalyst for several nations sending whaling expeditions to the islands. This claim is contentious\u2014others have pointed to strong evidence that it was Jonas Poole's reports in 1610, that led to the establishment of English whaling, and voyages of Nicholas Woodcock and Willem Cornelisz van Muyden in 1612, which led to the establishment of Dutch, French and Spanish whaling.Purchas 1625, p.\u00a024.; Conway 1906, p.\u00a053.

Fotherby eventually stumbled across Jan Mayen, thinking it a new discovery and naming it \"Sir Thomas Smith's Island\",Purchas 1625, pp.\u00a082\u201389. though the first verifiable records of the discovery of the island had been made a year earlier, in 1614."]}]}}
