Within a year the first biography, The Life of Sir Ernest Shackleton, by Hugh Robert Mill, was published. This book, as well as being a tribute to the explorer, was a practical effort to assist his family; Shackleton died some \u00a340,000 in debt (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) A further initiative was the establishment of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist the education of his children and the support of his mother."]}, {"page": "Clements Markham", "response": ["More critical assessments of Markham's life and work were to follow.

In time, questions would be raised about the accuracy of some of his Hakluyt translations, and about the evidence of haste in the preparation of other publications. On a personal level he had made enemies as well as friends; Frank Debenham, the geologist who served with both Scott and Shackleton, called Markham \"a dangerous old man\",Riffenburgh, p.\u00a0293. while William Speirs Bruce wrote of Markham's \"malicious opposition to the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition\".Speak, pp.\u00a0130\u2013131."]}, {"page": "Carsten Borchgrevink", "response": ["Hugh Robert Mill, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: \"His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a fresh breeze of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink very much at that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some of us as boding well for exploration\". The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas. Instead, it passed a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, to the effect that \"the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century\".Borchgrevink, pp. 9\u201310"]}, {"page": "William Speirs Bruce", "response": ["The Dundee Whaling Expedition, 1892\u201393, was an attempt to investigate the commercial possibilities of whaling in Antarctic waters by locating a source of right whales in the region.

Bruce was recommended to the expedition by Hugh Robert Mill, an acquaintance from Granton who was now librarian to the Royal Geographical Society in London. Although it would finally curtail his medical studies, Bruce did not hesitate; with William Gordon Burn Murdoch as an assistant he took up his duties on Balaena under Capt. Alexander Fairweather.

According to the RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill, as early as March 1920 Shackleton had talked about two possible schemes\u2014the Beaufort Sea exploration, and \"an oceanographical expedition with the object of visiting all the little-known islands of the South Atlantic and South Pacific\".Mills, p. 287 By June 1921, the latter plan had expanded to include a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and the mapping of around 2,000\u00a0miles (3,200\u00a0km) of uncharted coastline. It would also encompass a search for \"lost\" or wrongly charted sub-Antarctic islands (including Dougherty Island, Tuanaki, and the Nimrod Islands),Harrington, p. 1 and would investigate possible mineral resources to be exploited in these rediscovered lands. A scientific research program would include a visit to Gough Island, and an investigation of a possible \"underwater continental connection between Africa and America.\" Shackleton's biographer Margery Fisher calls the plan \"diffuse\", and \"far too comprehensive for one small body of men to tackle within two years\",Fisher, pp. 446\u201349 while according to Roland Huntford, the expedition had no obvious goal and was \"only too clearly a piece of improvisation, a pretext [for Shackleton] to get away\"."]}, {"page": "Henry B.

Another member of the shore party, Louis Bernacchi, was Australian; the remainder were all Scandinavian. This annoyed Markham all the more,Crane, p. 74 and he subsequently rebuked the RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch. Mill had toasted the success of the expedition, calling it \"a reproach to human enterprise\" that there were parts of the earth that man had never attempted to reach. He hoped that this reproach would be lifted through \"the munificence of Sir George Newnes and the courage of Mr Borchgrevink\".Borchgrevink, p. 25", "Despite the unexplained disappearance of many of Hansen's notes, Hugh Robert Mill described the expedition as \"interesting as a dashing piece of scientific work\". The meteorological and magnetic conditions of Victoria Land had been recorded for a full year; the location of the South Magnetic Pole had been calculated (though not visited); samples of the continent's natural fauna and flora, and of its geology, had been collected.
