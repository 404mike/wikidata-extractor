Alfred Fabian Hess stated: \"Light equals vitamin D.\" Adolf Windaus, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 for his work on the constitution of sterols and their connection with vitamins. In 1929, a group at NIMR in Hampstead, London, were working on the structure of vitamin D, which was still unknown, as well as the structure of steroids. A meeting took place with J.B.S. Haldane, J.D. Bernal, and Dorothy Crowfoot to discuss possible structures, which contributed to bringing a team together. X-ray crystallography demonstrated the sterol molecules were flat, not as proposed by the German team led by Windaus. In 1932, Otto Rosenheim and Harold King published a paper putting forward structures for sterols and bile acids which found immediate acceptance. The informal academic collaboration between the team members Robert Benedict Bourdillon, Otto Rosenheim, Harold King, and Kenneth Callow was very productive and led to the isolation and characterization of vitamin D. At this time, the policy of the Medical Research Council was not to patent discoveries, believing the results of medical research should be open to everybody. In the 1930s, Windaus clarified further the chemical structure of vitamin D."]}, {"page": "1946 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Robert Benedict Bourdillon, MC, AFC, DM, Director, Electro Medical Research Unit, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Medical Research Council."]}, {"page": "1918 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Captain Robert Benedict Bourdillon "]}, {"page": "Robert Bourdillon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Benedict Bourdillon"]}, {"page": "R.
