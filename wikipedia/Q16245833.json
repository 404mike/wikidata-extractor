He released 13 players at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. His first summer signing was former two-time Player of the Year Tom Pope on a free transfer after he managed to secure his release from Bury. He went on to sign ten more players during the window: goalkeepers Rob Lainton and Sam Hornby, defenders Joe Davis, Antony Kay, Gavin Gunning, Lawrie Wilson and Graham Kelly, midfielders Michael Tonge, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, David Worrall and Harry Middleton, and striker Tyrone Barnett; he also signed youngsters Rekeil Pyke, Marcus Harness, Tyler Denton, Ben Whitfield, Jack Stobbs and Tom Anderson on loan. However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\". Supporter website OneValeFan described this as \"a somewhat unlikely claim\" as the club had only exited administration in November 2012."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| Marcus Harness"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 7 August 2015 || RM ||  || Marcus Harness || Ilkeston || 4 September 2015 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Heading into July, Brown brought in target man striker Tyrone Barnett on a free transfer from AFC Wimbledon.

He signed 19-year old Huddersfield Town striker Rekeil Pyke on a season-long loan. As last season's captain Ben Purkiss rejected a new contract offer, Brown signed right-back Lawrie Wilson on a free transfer from Bolton Wanderers to replace him. Having decided against signing one of the wingers on trial, Brown instead brought in Burton Albion's Marcus Harness on a season-long loan. On the same day that Barnett was revealed to have suffered a serious hamstring tear, the club announced that trialist centre-back Gavin Gunning had signed a contract of undisclosed-length. The day before the opening game of the season, Brown secured veteran trialist midfielder Michael Tonge to a one-year deal, and also brought in 21-year old winger Ben Whitfield on a half-season loan from A.F.C.
