Henderson has played most of his career as a forward, but he has also been used in various midfield roles, he can operate on both sides of the pitch as a winger, and has captained his club on numerous occasions.\nHenderson started his career with Norwich City and made almost 70 first team appearances with them before joining Northampton Town in July 2007 following a six-month loan spell at Rotherham United. He remained at Northampton Town for 18 months and then played for Luton Town and in the Turkish football league with Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc, prior to signing for Colchester United in January 2010. Henderson hit 11 goals for Colchester United in the 2010\u201311 campaign, including home and away winners against Rochdale, and then scored again at Spotland for Colchester in October 2011. He scored 26 times in 130 outings for United, but left the club after manager Joe Dunne oversaw a shake-up of his squad earlier in 2013. Henderson was one of the most consistent performers in Rochdale's promotion campaign, missing only one game through suspension and scoring 11 goals, including several Goal of the Season contenders.\nHenderson joined Rochdale on a free transfer in February 2013 after being released by Colchester. His performances led to the offer of a two-year contract last summer, a deal which has since been extended until 2016.Henderson has played internationally for England four times at under-18 and once at under-20 level, and is also eligible to represent Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colchester United F.C.", "response": ["The 2009\u201310 season kicked off with a bang as Colchester United thrashed recently relegated Norwich City 7\u20131 on the opening day of the season at Carrow Road.
