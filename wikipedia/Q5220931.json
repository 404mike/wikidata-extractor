He played over 100 games for the Vale in two seasons, before he signed for Oldham Athletic in June 2008. Again a first team regular, he left after two seasons to join Chesterfield in May 2010. He helped the club to the League Two title in 2010\u201311, and also won himself a place on the division's PFA Team of the Year. He also helped the club to the League Trophy title in 2012. He returned to Macclesfield Town in August 2013, and played in the club's defeat at the 2017 FA Trophy Final, before helping the club to win promotion back to the English Football League as champions of the National League. He was appointed as the club's caretaker-manager in November 2018, before announcing his retirement in July 2019.

On 29 January, three Macclesfield players (Emmanuel Osadebe, Theo Vassell and Miles Welch-Hayes) approached the EFL and had their contracts terminated ahead of the transfer deadline. Club staff wages for February were also not paid on time, leading the PFA to contact the club. On 9 March, the club was charged with misconduct by the EFL for failing to pay players on time, and was referred to an independent disciplinary commission after failing to fulfil the Crewe and Plymouth fixtures. In April 2020, it was reported that the club had not paid its players for a fifth time, failing to pay March's wages, and later that the first team, backroom staff and most office staff had been put on furlough (temporary leave) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Danny Whitaker"]}, {"page": "Wilmslow", "response": ["* Danny Whitaker"]}, {"page": "Robbie Savage", "response": ["Savage's involvement with Stockport Town led to him becoming involved with the creation of phoenix club Macclesfield F.C. in October 2020.

Foyle took over first team responsibilities at the club on 13 February 2004 after Brian Horton left by mutual consent, and the team narrowly missed out on a play-off place on goal difference at the end of the 2003\u201304 season. Following the end of the season, Foyle aimed to keep players at the club, but eventually lost top scorer Stephen McPhee and midfielder Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. The club also had to make massive cut backs due to having just come out of administration and when Steve Brooker (a player signed by Horton on Foyle's recommendation) was sold to Bristol City any chance of a play-off push was unlikely. Vale eventually finished 17th in a frustrating season where many players suffered injuries leaving the squad threadbare on more than one occasion. The next two seasons saw an increase in the playing budget as Vale got their house in order after administration and Foyle steered the side to 13th and 12th-place finishes in League One. Two cup runs to the 4th round of the FA Cup in 2005\u201306 and 4th round of the League Cup in 2006\u201307, coupled with the selling of players such as Chris Birchall and Billy Paynter saw the club make a profit on the financial front.

Showing a talent for signing attackers, he bought striker Leon Constantine for \u00a320,000 from Torquay United, who would hit 26 goals in the 2006\u201307 season; attacking midfielder Danny Whitaker from Macclesfield Town, who would have a long and successful career; and winger Jeff Smith, who impressed enough to win a \u00a360,000 transfer to Carlisle United."]}, {"page": "Simon Ford", "response": ["Ford signed for Chesterfield under freedom of contract in June 2010 and is trying to successfully replace the recently departed Kevin Austin, in defence, who has been released by Chesterfield.

However, the following season saw his defensive partner Garry McDonald depart the club to be replaced by Danny Whitaker and although the club started the season well, gaps in the midfield in some games led the club to falter badly from a position in the play-offs to midtable by the end of the season and new manager Dave Penney chose not to keep him at the club."]}]}}
