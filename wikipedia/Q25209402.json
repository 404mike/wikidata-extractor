He was admitted as a solicitor in 1880 and travelled to British India in 1881, where he gained employment as an assistant with the solicitors firm Tasker and Wilson. He later became a senior partner in the firm of King and Josselyn in Madras. While in India he played minor cricket matches for the Madras cricket team, and on return visits to England he played minor matches for Durham, though he did not feature for the county in the Minor Counties Championship. On one such visit to England in 1895, King played a first-class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Yorkshire at Scarborough, where he batted once and was dismissed in the MCC's first innings' without scoring by George Hirst. In India he rose to the position of commissioner for the Madras High Court and was one of the organisers for the visit of the Prince of Wales to Madras in 1906. For his efforts, King was made a Knights Bachelor by the Prince of Wales in May 1906. King died in England at Hove in July 1920."]}]}}
