Frisby House", "response": ["Joseph H. Frisby lived a significant life, having served as a justice of the peace, having operated a mercantile business, and having been mayor of Provo for two years. Frisby's election was tangled up in controversy. During this time, the town of Provo was divided. Needing a railroad, the east side of town insisted that it be built on the east side of Provo, while the west insisted it belonged on the west side. Hoping to sway the decision, the west side of Provo nominated Joseph Frisby for mayor in hopes that he would act in their favor. Having won the election but narrowly, Joseph decided to postpone the decision until he was out of office.", "Joseph Frisby sold his house to Charles Hopkins in 1913. Hopkins, born February 21, 1864, at Dorcetshire, England, immigrated to America in 1887 and settled in the town of Elkhorn, Montana. In Elkhorn Hopkins was primarily involved in mining and the mercantile business, as well as serving as the local postmaster for fifteen years. In 1912 Hopkins relocated to Provo, where he was elected to the Provo City Commission, where he served for thirteen years. Under his administration the City and County Building was built, the Provo Memorial Park was planned and most of Provo's streets were paved. Hopkins also served as the chairman of the Utah County WPA and FERA. He died November 9, 1936 in the Frisby House."]}, {"page": "Frisby, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Frisby"]}]}}
