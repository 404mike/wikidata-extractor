The family later settled at Kuruman, to the north of the Vaal River, among the Batswana people. Here they lived and worked passionately for the missionary cause, enduring many hardships.  Once he went for days without water and his mouth became so dry he was unable to speak.  Often he bound his stomach to help him endure fasting when he could not find food to eat.Lorella Rouster, Testimonies of Faith, \"Steady in All Circumstances--Robert and Mary Moffatt,\" (Cleveland, OH:Sunday School Times/Gospel Herald, Summer Quarter, 2006), p. 156 During this period, Robert Moffat made frequent journeys into the neighbouring regions as far north as the Matabele country.  He communicated the results of these journeys to the Royal Geographical Society (Journal 25-38 and Proceedings ii). Whilst in Britain on leave (1839\u201343) an account of the family's experience, Missionary Labours and Scenes in South Africa (1842) was published. He translated the whole of the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress into Setswana, although these translations are today considered as poor and relying on many colonial and racist assumptions about the Setswana language.Comaroff, Jean and Comaroff, John L. (1989) The colonization of consciousness in South Africa. Economy and Society. 18(3): 267-296.

Their grandson Howard Unwin Moffat became a prime minister of Southern Rhodesia.  Mary preceded Robert in death in 1870, at home in England where they had returned because of failing health.  For the last twelve years of his life, Robert spoke throughout England, seeking to raise interest in the mission work.  He was presented to Queen Victoria twice at her request and was presented with a Doctor of Divinity degree from Edinburgh University.Ethel Daniels Hubbard, The Moffats, (New York: Missionay Education Movement of the U.S. & Canada, 1917) p.285-286", "* John Smith Moffat (1885) Lives of Robert and Mary Moffat"]}, {"page": "London Missionary Society", "response": ["In September 1816 Robert Moffat (1795\u20131883) was commissioned in the Surrey Chapel, on the same day as John Williams.
