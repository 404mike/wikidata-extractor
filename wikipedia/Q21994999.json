Yet it seems that he was able to sell his interests there to the Luttrell family, a transaction that can in reality have entailed little more than a guarantee not to oppose the Luttrell candidates and so bid up the price of votes: lavish bribery by the Luttrells was still necessary to secure their seats. When the Luttrells tired of it, the borough passed into the hands of a West Indies merchant, Joseph Foster Barham, who occupied one seat himself and later kept the second for his step-grandson, John Foster Barham. But when he, too, found himself in monetary difficulties, he sold the borough to Earl Grosvenor. He not only vacated his seat immediately to allow Grosvenor's nominee (Edward Stanley, a future Conservative Prime Minister but then a Whig) to be elected, but took the trouble to introduce Stanley to the electors. By the time of the Reform Act, Grosvenor was being accused of having countered the prevalence of bribery by a different form of corruption, having hostile voters disqualified by persuading the local overseers of the poor (his appointees) not to rate them for scot and lot, and creating new votes by finding nominal jobs for \"unemployables\" with the surveyor of roads.", "| Joseph Foster Barham", "| Joseph Foster BarhamBarham was re-elected in 1806, but had also been elected for Okehampton, which he chose to represent, and did not sit for Stockbridge in this Parliament.", "|rowspan=\"2\"| Joseph Foster Barham"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1806\u20131818)", "response": ["|10 January 1807||Stockbridge  ||u ||\tJoseph Foster Barham ||\tSir John Fleming Leicester || Chose to sit for Okehampton"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1818\u20131832)", "response": ["|30 July 1822||Stockbridge||u||Joseph Foster Barham||Edward Stanley||Resignation"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain by-elections (1790\u20131800)", "response": ["|8 April 1799||Stockbridge||u||Joseph Foster Barham||John Agnew||Resignation"]}, {"page": "Trecwn", "response": ["The history of Trecwn in the 18th and 19th centuries is linked with the Barham family, who funded the building of the school in 1877.
