Art critic John Anthony Thwaites pointed to von Huendeberg's Russian-Baltic heritage and the golden background used in Russian icons.  Art historian Ivo Kranzfelder describes how in his oil paintings, von Huendeberg created a feeling of space by juxtaposing broad planes of colour in almost perspectival arrangements.

The topic of \"colour without form\" was always on his mind.  Collages were a natural extension of these techniques.  Just as his paintings often have a sculpted feeling, his collages always evoke the pictorial.
