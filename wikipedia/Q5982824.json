He played first-class cricket for Sussex, Surrey and Warwickshire in a career stretching from 1989 to 2008.The cricket writer, Colin Bateman, commented, \"the selection of Ian Salisbury against Pakistan in 1992 made cricket romantics rejoice.  When he played at Lord's he became the first specialist leg-spinner selected for England since Robin Hobbs in 1971\".
