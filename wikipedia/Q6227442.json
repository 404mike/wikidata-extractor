His first season signings included Mark Leonard from Tranmere Rovers, John Crabbe from Hereford United and David Pullar from Exeter City as Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme. Among his first transfer successes were Dave Waller (sold to Shrewsbury Town), Gary Blissett (sold to Brentford) and Geoff Thomas (sold to Crystal Palace); gradually the club moved forward."]}, {"page": "Crabbe", "response": ["*John Crabbe, Flemish merchant, pirate and soldier", "*John Crabbe, English soccer player"]}, {"page": "Weymouth F.C.", "response": ["*  John Crabbe (Sept 1997 \u2013 Dec 1997)"]}]}}
