He originated the idea of selling garden seeds in \"penny packets\" and built a very successful business on the concept.\nAt the age of 50 he became an enthusiastic golfer and then from 1923 to 1925 he, together with his brother James, started sponsoring a number of golf tournaments and matches mostly at his home club of Verulam near St Albans. From late 1925 he started employing Abe Mitchell as his private coach. In early 1926 the idea for a match between British and American professional golfers was proposed. Ryder became involved and sponsored the event. It had been his intention that the match would be the first Ryder Cup but it was later decided that the match would not be an official contest. The first official event did not take place until 1927 for which Ryder donated a gold trophy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "England", "response": ["Golf has been prominent in England; due in part to its cultural and geographical ties to Scotland, the home of Golf.

In 1926, a larger than usual contingent of American professionals were travelling to Britain to compete in the Open Championship, two weeks before their own Championship. In February it was announced that Walter Hagen would select a team of four American professionals (including himself) to play four British professionals in a match before the Open Championship. The match would be a stroke play competition with each playing the four opposing golfers over 18 holes. In mid-April, it was announced that \"A golf enthusiast, who name has not yet been made public\" was ready to donate a cup for an annual competition. Later in April it was announced that Samuel Ryder would be presenting a trophy \"for annual competition between British and American professionals.\" with the first match to be played on 4 and 5 June \"but the details are not yet decided\", and then in May it was announced that the match would be a match-play competition, 8-a-side, foursomes on the first day, singles on the second. Eventually, at Hagen's request, 10 players competed for each team. Samuel Ryder (together with his brother James) had sponsored a number of British professional events starting in 1923.", "The match was widely reported as being for the \"Ryder Cup\". However Golf Illustrated for 11 June states that because of uncertainty following the general strike in May, which led to uncertainty about how many Americans would be visiting Britain, Samuel Ryder had decided to withhold the cup for a year. It has also been suggested that because Walter Hagen chose the American team rather than the American PGA, that only those Americans who had travelled to Britain to play in the Open were available for selection and that it contained a number of players born outside the United States, also contributed to the feeling that the match ought to be regarded as unofficial. In addition the Americans \"had only just landed in England and were not yet in full practice.\""]}, {"page": "Jack Nicklaus", "response": ["During the 1977 Ryder Cup at Royal Lytham & St Annes, Nicklaus approached the PGA of Great Britain about the urgency to improve the competitive level of the contest.

Nicklaus pitched his ideas, adding: \"It is vital to widen the selection procedures if the Ryder Cup is to continue to enjoy its past prestige.\" The changes in team selection procedure were approved by descendants of the Samuel Ryder family, along with The PGA of America. The major change was expanding selection procedures to include players from the European Tournament Players' Division, and \"that European Members be entitled to play on the team\". This meant that professional players on the European Tournament Players' Division, the forerunner to the European Tour we have today, from continental Europe would be eligible to play in the Ryder Cup."]}, {"page": "Culture of the United Kingdom", "response": ["The modern game of golf originated in Scotland, with the Fife town of St Andrews known internationally as the \"home of golf\".Keay (1994) op cit page 839. \"In 1834 the Royal and Ancient Golf Club declared St. Andrews 'the Alma Mater of golf'\". and to many golfers the Old Course, an ancient links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage.Cochrane, Alistair (ed) Science and Golf IV: proceedings of the World Scientific Congress of Golf.
