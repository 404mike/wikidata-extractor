The band returned to the Monseigneur in March 1934 until the summer when the Monseigneur was sold to become a cinema. In September 1934, Al Bowlly and Bill Harty left to join Ray Noble in U.S. For about a year from November 1934, Stone moved to the Regal Zonophone record label, continued with theatre tours, and the band was resident for a time at the Hollywood Restaurant. Alan Kane became the main vocalist while there were also vocal contributions from band members Nat Gonella, Joe Ferrie, Tiny Winters, Joe Crossman, and American composer Al Hoffman. When Gonella left to concentrate on his own Georgians band in March 1935, trumpeter Tommy McQuater joined Stone's band. On 12 October, Stone featured Sam Browne as vocalist for the first time with \"Cheek To Cheek\" and \"Isn't This A Lovely Day?\". In November, Stone and his band returned to the Decca record label. In 1936, Stone stopped touring and formed a smaller band which opened on 30 March at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris. The band also began to broadcast regularly for commercial radio stations Radio Normandy and Radio Luxembourg. In October, Stone became musical director for the show On Your Toes (opened February 1937). The band continued at the Cafe de Paris until 31 July 1937. In September, Stone became musical director of the show Hide and Seek at the London Hippodrome, starring Cicely Courtneidge and Bobby Howes."]}, {"page": "2008 in music", "response": ["*January 20 \u2013 Tommy McQuater, 93, British jazz trumpeter"]}, {"page": "John McLevy", "response": ["He played in Europe for Benny Goodman in the 1970s, alongside George Masso, Hank Jones and Slam Stewart.
