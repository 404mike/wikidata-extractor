He played as a forward.\nSmith was born in Edinburgh. He studied medicine, and eventually qualified as a doctor, combining this with playing football on an amateur or semi-professional basis. He spent time with several clubs in both Scotland and England, playing league football only where it did not interfere with his medical career. While with Birmingham City, he scored regularly for the reserve team and was highly rated, but his work at the Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre restricted him to only two first-team appearances.His father, Jimmy, played professionally for Clyde and St Mirren in the 1930s, and his son, Matt, turned professional with Oldham Athletic in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["Ian Smith (1919\u20132007) was the Prime Minister of Rhodesia from 1964 to 1979.", "Ian Smith or Iain Smith may also refer to:", "* Ian Smith (actor) (born 1938), Australian actor", "* Ian Smith (comedian) (born 1988), English comedian", "* Ian Smith (photographer), Scottish photographer", "* Ian Smith (Australian politician) (born 1939), Liberal Party", "* Ian Smith (South African cricketer) (1925\u20132015)", "* Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1957), player and commentator", "* Ian Smith (English cricketer) (born 1967), played for Glamorgan and Durham", "* Ian Smith (footballer, born 1952), Scottish football forward for Queens Park, Birmingham City", "* Ian Smith (footballer, born 1957), English football fullback for Tottenham Hotspur", "* Ian Smith (footballer, born 1998), Costa Rican footballer", "* Ian Smith (rugby union, born 1903) (1903\u20131972)", "* Ian Smith (rugby union, born 1941) (1941\u20132017)", "* Ian Smith (rugby league) (born 1965), Super League referee", "* Ian Smith (rugby union, born 1965), rugby union coach", "* Ian Smith (impresario) (1939\u20132019), journalist, businessman, and impresario", "* Ian Smith (lobbyist), Australian businessman, corporate advisor and journalist"]}, {"page": "Ian Taylor-Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Smith (footballer, born 1952)"]}, {"page": "Ian Smith (footballer born 1952)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Smith (footballer, born 1952)"]}]}}
