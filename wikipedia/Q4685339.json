In 1988, Schofield joined with pipers Pauline Cato and Colin Ross in forming the band Border Spirit.Schofield's style of playing was initially heavily influenced by that of Border musician Billy Pigg (1902-1968).  Schofield produced a biography of Pigg, The Border Minstrel (ISBN 0-902510-16-9) researched by Adrian D Schofield and edited by Julia Say, which included all of Pigg's known compositions, and some other tunes from his repertoire, and was published by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 1997. Later in his piping career, Schofield turned to favor the more close-fingered detached method of traditional pipers such as Tom Clough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northumbrian smallpipes", "response": ["For decoration, it is common to play short grace notes preceding a melody note. Some pipers allow themselves to play these open-fingered rather than staccato, and Billy Pigg was able to get great expressive effects in this way \u2013 'You should be able to hear the bairns crying'. But 'choyting' (the complex open-fingered gracing after the manner of Highland piping) is generally frowned on, and Tom Clough made a point of avoiding open-fingered ornament altogether, considering open-fingering 'a grievous error'. Several pipers play in highly close-fingered styles, Chris Ormston and Adrian Schofield among them; even among those such as Kathryn Tickell who use open fingering for expression, the close-fingered technique is the basis of their playing.", "*Adrian Schofield "]}, {"page": "Billy Pigg", "response": ["He has been hugely influential, and many pipers have sought to emulate his style, notably Adrian Schofield."]}, {"page": "List of published bagpipe music", "response": ["* Billy Pigg, The Border Minstrel, Adrian Schofield and Julia Say - NPS (2 vols.)"]}, {"page": "Inky Adrian", "response": ["#Redirect Adrian Schofield"]}, {"page": "Colin Ross (pipemaker)", "response": ["Ross served as the Chairman of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society from 1968 to 1980, and again from 1992, stepping down in 2010.Northumbrian Pipers' Society \u2013 History .
