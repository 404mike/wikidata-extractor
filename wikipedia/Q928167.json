Goodwillie came through the Dundee United youth system and he won the SPFA and SFWA Young Player of the Year awards for the 2010\u201311 season. His performances with United earned him selection for the Scotland national team and a \u00a32 million move to Blackburn Rovers, who were then in the English Premier League. He failed to hold a regular place in the Blackburn team and was successively loaned to Crystal Palace, Dundee United and Blackpool. Goodwillie was released by Blackburn in 2014, after which he signed with Aberdeen. After a loan spell with Ross County, Goodwillie moved to Plymouth Argyle in 2016. He left Plymouth by mutual consent in January 2017, after a judge ruled in a civil case that Goodwillie had committed an act of rape.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 28", "response": ["*  1989   \u2013 David Goodwillie, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Dundee United F.C.", "response": ["Eleven years passed until the next Scottish Cup final appearance, when United lost 1\u20130 to Celtic in 2005.
