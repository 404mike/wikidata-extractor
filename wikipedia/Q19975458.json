Eric Apperly beat Tom Howard 4&3 in the final, while in 1921 Legh Winser beat Bruce Pearce 6&5 in the final. In late 1921 it was announced that Lord Forster, the Governor-General of Australia, had given a Challenge Cup, to be held by the winner until the following championship. The cup was presented to Legh Winser, the 1921 champion, by Archibald Weigall, the Governor of South Australia, at a ceremony at Adelaide Golf Club in April 1922. Ivo Whitton had won the Open in 1912 and 1913 but it was not until 1922 that he won the amateur championship, beating Henry McClelland 3&2 in the final. He repeated his success in 1923 beating Harry Sinclair by the same score. There were 16 qualifiers in 1922, with four 36-hole matches, but the number reverted to 8 in 1923, before expanding again to 16 in 1924 where it stayed until 1939.

Whitton won the Open for the third time in 1926 and then reached the final of the amateur, but was beaten by Len Nettlefold, 2 up. Nettlefold won again in 1928 but otherwise there no multiple winners up to 1934. In the 1920s there had been some variation in the days of the week when the Open and amateur were played but from 1930 they became standardised with the Open finishing on a Saturday and the Amateur being played from Monday to Thursday of the following week. The period from 1935 to 1939 was dominated by Jim Ferrier who won four times in the five years, 1935, 1936, 1938 and 1939.
