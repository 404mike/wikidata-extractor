Part of the powerful Villiers family, he was a friend of Edward Hyde, chief advisor to Charles I and Charles II from 1641 to 1668.\nHe fought for the Royalists in the First English Civil War and went into exile from 1649 until 1652 when he returned to England. During the Interregnum, he was a member of the Sealed Knot, a Royalist conspiracy group which sought to restore Charles II to the throne.\nFollowing the Stuart Restoration in 1660, he received a number of minor offices; more significant were the positions held by his family within the Royal household. His wife was governess to the future queens Mary II and Anne, while three of his daughters accompanied Mary to the Dutch Republic when she married William of Orange in 1677. His eldest son later served both William and Anne as Lord Chamberlain.\nVilliers supported the deposition of James II by William and Mary in the November 1688 Glorious Revolution.
