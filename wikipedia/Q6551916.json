During her time at Maplins she began a relationship with Spike, and eventually decided she would like to marry him and live in a bungalow. Spike also wanted to get married, but did not want to give up being a comic in favour of a steady job, which upset April. She broke up their relationship after Joe Maplin leaked a story that Spike and Gladys were having an affair, but they got back together when this was proved false. Gladys often reprimands April for \"mooning after Spike\" rather than spending time with the campers. She and Spike were still together at the end of the 1960 season (although before that, they briefly split up) and it is unknown where they went next."]}, {"page": "Regan", "response": ["* Linda Regan (born 1949), English actress who appeared in the British TV show Hi-de-Hi!"]}, {"page": "Brian Murphy (actor)", "response": ["Murphy's second wife is Hi-de-Hi! actress Linda Regan whom he married in 1995; they live in Kent.
