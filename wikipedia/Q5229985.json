An extremely skilful and fast player, for much of his career his trademark was playing without shin pads; something that would be contrary to the rules of the game today.\nHe made his senior debut in Burnley's 8\u20131 defeat to West Bromwich Albion in the 1966/67 season.\nHe had a long and successful playing career, playing for almost 20 years and totalling over 450 league appearances whilst playing for Burnley, QPR, Everton, Vancouver Whitecaps, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers. He won 8 England caps overall whilst at Queens Park Rangers. His first England cap was given to him by manager Don Revie on 30 October 1974 in a 3\u20130 win against Czechoslovakia. He set up the first goal in the game. In 1981, he played a single summer season with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the North American Soccer League.Thomas's most successful season was undoubtedly 1975\u201376 while playing for QPR. QPR led the First Division for much of the season, narrowly missing out by one point to Liverpool after the final game of the season. Thomas was a pivotal figure in the team, providing Stan Bowles, Gerry Francis and others with outstanding service from the wing. Following his transfer to Everton, Thomas continued to enjoy success in the 1977\u201378 season while playing for Everton. Everton's top marksman Bob Latchford scored 30 goals in the league that season, Thomas providing more of his goals than anybody else with some more accurate crosses. His transfer in October 1972 from Burnley to QPR was then a record fee for a Second Division Club: \u00a3165,000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Queens Park Rangers F.C.", "response": ["In 1966\u201367, QPR won the Division Three championship and became the first Third Division club to win the League Cup on Saturday, 4 March 1967, beating West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132, coming back from a two-goal deficit. It is still the only major trophy that QPR have won. It was also the first League Cup final to be held at Wembley Stadium. After winning promotion in 1968 to the top flight for the first time in their history, Rangers were relegated after just one season and spent the next four years in Division Two. Terry Venables joined from Spurs at the beginning of the 1969\u201370 season and Rodney Marsh was sold to Manchester City. During this time, new QPR heroes emerged including Phil Parkes, Don Givens, Dave Thomas and Stan Bowles.

He used the pseudonym \"P.B. Yuill\" after completing the first book as he felt critics dismissed his contribution to They Used to Play on Grass as a gimmick. They Used to Play on Grass was voted at #172 in the BBC's The Big Read survey in 2003. He is credited as co-creator of the ITV detective series Hazell. Having been a football pundit for BBC since the mid-80s, he left for ITV in 1994, following a legal dispute with the corporation over allegations made against him in a Panorama programme.
