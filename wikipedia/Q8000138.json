Fisher and C. LeMesurier), organised by Captain E. Gordon Reeves, at the Bristol Hotel, Colombo. Kennedy was appointed honorary president and R. W. Levers, the Government Agent of the North Central Province, as the first chairman with Reeves as honorary secretary of the society. The society's main concerns were to stop or reduce the commercial hunting of game as it was dramatically impacting on their enjoyment as sports hunters. The society's first success was the passing of legislation prohibiting the export of hides and horns and the trade in these commodities and trade in dried meat. In 1898, through the society's efforts, the Yala Sanctuary on the southeast coast of Ceylon was gazetted and the fauna of the Yala Sanctuary were granted protection from hunting."]}]}}
