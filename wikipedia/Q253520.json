Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Godfree was ranked in the world top ten from 1921 (when the rankings began) through 1927, reaching a career high of world No. 2 in those rankings in 1923, 1924, and 1926.\n\nGodfree won five Olympic medals in tennis at the 1920 Antwerp and 1924 Paris games, the most Olympic medals ever won by a tennis player until Venus Williams matched this record at the 2016 Olympic Games. In 1923 she captured the title at the World Covered Court Championships.\nGodfree won the Wimbledon singles title twice. In the 1924 final, Godfree recovered from a set and 4\u20131 (40\u201315) down against Helen Wills to win the title. This was the only defeat at Wimbledon for Wills who would go on to win eight titles. In the 1926 final, Godfree recovered from a 3\u20131 and game-point-against deficit in the third set to defeat Lili de Alvarez.\nThe 1924 Wimbledon final was not Godfree's only victory over Wills. Godfree also defeated Wills during the 1924 Wightman Cup 6\u20132, 6\u20132. On at least two other occasions, Godfree pushed Wills to the limit. Wills won their quarterfinal in the 1923 U.S. Championships 2\u20136, 6\u20132, 7\u20135 after Godfree recovered to 5\u20135 in the third set after trailing 5\u20132.

She presented the winner's trophy to Martina Navratilova in 1986, in honour of the centenary year of play at Wimbledon. Godfree was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1978.\nIn badminton, Godfree won eight All England Open Badminton Championships from 1920 through 1925, considered the unofficial World Badminton Championships until 1977.\nShe was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1987 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while shopping in a supermarket in East Sheen.Godfree died on 19 June 1992 at the age of 96.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 7", "response": ["*1896 \u2013 Kathleen McKane Godfree, English tennis and badminton player (d. 1992)"]}, {"page": "1992", "response": ["* June 19 \u2013 Kathleen McKane Godfree, British tennis player (b. 1896)"]}, {"page": "Venus Williams", "response": ["Williams has won four Olympic gold medals, one in singles and three in women's doubles with her sister, along with a silver medal in mixed doubles, tying her with Kathleen McKane Godfree for the most Olympic medals won by a male or female tennis player in history. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Williams became only the second player to win Olympic gold medals in both singles and doubles at one Olympic Games, after Helen Wills Moody at the 1924 Summer Olympics (she was followed by her sister in 2012). After winning silver in mixed doubles with Rajeev Ram at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Williams became the first tennis player to win a medal at four Olympic games, as well as the first player in the Open Era to win an Olympic medal in all three events (singles, doubles, mixed). She and Serena are also the only tennis players in history with four Olympic gold medals, as well as the only ones to win Olympic gold in the same event on three occasions. She along with her sister Serena are the only Open Era female tennis players to win Olympic Gold in both singles and doubles category.", "Williams failed to medal in her singles and doubles events at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, falling in the first round in both events, marking her worst exits of her Olympic career. She entered the mixed doubles event with Rajeev Ram, defeating the Netherlands in the first round after saving match point. The pair then defeated Italy in the quarterfinals and India in the semifinals to set up a clash with the United States team of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jack Sock in the gold medal match. The duo lost to Mattek-Sands and Sock 7\u20136(7\u20133), 1\u20136, [7\u201310]. By winning a silver medal, Williams became the only female player (besides Kathleen McKane Godfree) to win a medal in all three events (singles, doubles and mixed); her five medals mean she now shares the record for most Olympic medals won in tennis with Godfree.", "|Summer Olympics||2000\u20132016||Most Olympic medals won by a male or female player (5)||Kathleen McKane Godfree", "||Summer Olympics||2000\u20132016||Has won an Olympic medal in all three events (singles, doubles & mixed)||Kathleen McKane Godfree"]}]}}
