He made his first-class debut for Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1987 (having played a single Sunday League match for them the previous season) and remained with that county for his entire career, scoring 3,778 runs at 27.98 and taking 262 wickets at 30.35 with his medium-pace seamers in his 124 matches.\nEnormously popular with the Lancashire crowd thanks to his uncomplicated batting style and equally old-fashioned waistline, his most successful period came towards the end of his career. In 1998, he helped his county to both NatWest Trophy and Sunday League success. He then made his One Day International debut against Sri Lanka later in the summer. For these performances he was made one of 1999's Wisden Cricketers of the Year.\nAustin was selected for the 1999 World Cup squad, and opened the bowling with Darren Gough in England's opening game, taking 2/25 against Sri Lanka at Lord's. However, his international career was to last just one more match, against Kenya later in the same tournament. He spent the rest of his career at Lancashire, where his benefit in 2000 raised \u00a3155,000. Austin played no first-class cricket after early June 2001, but continued to appear in some one-day games for another year.\nAfter some appearances for Cumberland in 2002, and participating in the Lancashire League's Worsley Cup final the following year, Austin retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 2003 season.  He returned to the Leagues playing with distinction for St Annes in the Northern Premier League, before returning to his boyhood club, Baxenden and helping them to the Ribblesdale League title, before retiring from all cricket at the end of the 2010 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Ian Austin"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The team that had been so successful in the 1990s began to break up at the start of the 2000s. Since winning their last trophy in 1998, the team has lost eight semi-finals and two finals. In 2008 Lancashire managed to finish second in the County Championship. The competition was divided into two divisions for the 2000 season, with Lancashire in the first division. Lancashire's one day form began to fluctuate in 2000, losing to Gloucestershire in the semi-finals of both the B&H Cup and the NatWest Trophy, and being relegated in the National League. In 2001, Lancashire avoided relegation by just 5 points and were not promoted in the National League. The end of the season saw the retirement of Ian Austin from first-class cricket and of Mike Atherton from all forms of cricket. John Crawley left the club in the winter after not being retained as captain. Between 2001 and 2002 saw the squad change significantly, with players recruited from Essex, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Yorkshire; the most notable additions to the squad were Stuart Law and David Byas\u00a0\u2013 the Yorkshire captain of the previous season. After a quiet 2001 season\u00a0\u2013 finishing mid-table in the county championship and again failing to secure promotion in the National League\u00a0\u2013 2002 was far more encouraging. Mike Watkinson was appointed cricket manager, and Stuart Law and Alec Swann both scored over 1,000 first-class runs and Peter Martin and Glen Chapple both took more than 50\u00a0wickets; the find of the season was that of James Anderson, who burst onto the scene with 50\u00a0wickets in the second half of the season, earning him a promotion to the England side. At the end of the season, Lancashire stalwarts Neil Fairbrother and Graham Lloyd retired.", "|Graham Lloyd and Ian Austin"]}, {"page": "Ian Austin", "response": ["Austin was born on 6 March 1965 and was adopted as a baby by Dudley school teachers Fred and Margaret Austin.
