His autobiography, The Key To My Cell, put forward his version of events, and what he considered \"the real conspiracy\" \u2014 that the arrests were part of a plan to intimidate the trade union movement.\nWarren was regarded as an energetic strike leader. As well as his work setting up pickets and speaking at union rallies and conferences, he demanded a minimum wage (of \u00a31 an hour) and campaigned to put an end to \"the lump\" \u2014 a practice prevalent on non-unionised building sites, whereby the employee surrendered their employment rights in return for a cash lump sum with no tax or insurance deducted.His death in 2004 from Parkinson's Disease has been linked with the long-term effects of the treatment he received during his incarceration, in particular the \"liquid cosh\" \u2013 a cocktail of tranquillisers administered to inmates.On 4 July 2009, a march was organised in Shrewsbury, by the local trades council and the Justice for Pickets campaign, starting from the Abbey, and finishing at the Lord Hill's Column, where the demonstrators were addressed by several speakers.\nAs of 2013, Ricky Tomlinson continues to campaign for Warren's name to be posthumously cleared, along with his own. He campaigned against the convictions at the Durham Miners' Gala in July 2013.The convictions were put aside by the Court of Appeal on Tuesday 23 March 2021 following new evidence unearthed at the National Archives that showed that Police officers had destroyed witness statements in support of the convicted Trade Unionists that would have exonerated them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Jenkins", "response": ["Jenkins opposed Michael Foot's attempts to grant pickets the right to stop lorries during strikes and he was dismayed by Anthony Crosland's decision to grant an amnesty to the 11 Labour councillors at Clay Cross who had been surcharged for refusing to increase council rents in accordance with the Conservatives' Housing Finance Act 1972.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 432. After two trade unionists, Ricky Tomlinson and Des Warren (known as the \"Shrewsbury Two\"), were imprisoned for intimidation and affray for their part in a strike, Jenkins refused to accede to demands from the labour movement that they should be released. This demonstrated Jenkins' increasing estrangement from much of the labour movement and for a time he was heckled in public by people chanting \"Free the Two\".Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 433. Jenkins also unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Cabinet to adopt electoral reform in the form of proportional representation and to have the Official Secrets Act 1911 liberalised to facilitate more open government.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 434\u2013435, p. 467."]}, {"page": "Richard Whiteley", "response": ["In 1973 Whiteley and Woodrow Wyatt presented the Anglia Television documentary The Red Under the Bed, about the trial of the Shrewsbury Two (Des Warren and Ricky Tomlinson), which was broadcast on the day that the trial jury retired to consider their verdict. The programme, which was heavily critical of the trade union movement, is now considered to have swayed jurors into returning a guilty verdict and was later cited by the Criminal Cases Review Commission as evidence that the verdicts were unsound. Warren and Tomlinson's convictions were overturned in 2021. Speaking in 2017 about the documentary, Tomlinson claimed to be in possession of confidential documents proving that it had been funded and written by British intelligence services and that Whiteley had been employed by MI5 at the time of broadcast."]}, {"page": "Ricky Tomlinson", "response": ["In 1972 he joined the flying pickets in a building workers' dispute in Shrewsbury. Following allegations of violence during this protest, in 1973 Tomlinson was charged with \"conspiracy to intimidate\" as one of the Shrewsbury Two. Despite pleading his innocence, he was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison, alongside fellow picket Des Warren. After his release in 1975, he disrupted the TUC conference by shouting from the wings after he had been prevented from speaking on the stage. In 2012, Tomlinson and others sought to have the convictions overturned by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). In 2013 a paper petition was launched, alongside the existing e-petition, for an Early Day Motion by MP John McDonnell to be brought. In July 2013, at the Durham Miners' Gala, he again campaigned against the convictions. In May 2020 it was announced that the CCRC had referred a number of convictions relating to the Shrewsbury dispute, including Tomlinson's, to the Court of Appeal which subsequently overturned the convictions in March 2021."]}, {"page": "Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians", "response": ["Five months after the strike, at a time when some of the strikers' aims had been largely settled, several building workers were investigated for alleged sabotage and vandalism during the dispute.  Some were subject to high-profile police investigation, under pressure from major contractors and politicians anxious to suppress the emergence of organised labour in the building industry, and 24 building workers were convicted and six jailed as a result of their picketing activities. The longest sentences were given to Ricky Tomlinson, a plasterer and TGWU strike leader, and Des Warren, a steel fixer and leading lay official of UCATT, who became known as the \"Shrewsbury Two\".", "Des Warren subsequently developed serious health problems, which Tomlinson attributes to the medication he took whilst in solitary confinement.", "In 2004, Des Warren died, without the pardon that his family had campaigned for."]}, {"page": "Warren (name)", "response": ["* Des Warren, British trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2004", "response": ["*Des Warren, 66, British trade unionist."]}, {"page": "Hugh Mais", "response": ["Hugh Mais was selected as the trial judge for the 1973 trial of those including Ricky Tomlinson and Des Warren charged in relation to picketing in Shrewsbury."]}]}}
