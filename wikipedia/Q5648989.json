To be honest 2012 is in my sights now which it wasn't this time last year. We will just have to see how my body holds up but that's the goal. As long as I'm still enjoying it and still up there challenging then I'll keep going. I want to try to prove everyone wrong and get that Olympic medal. I've been working closely with both my coach and my physio to keep my body going. My training has changed a lot and I only do bars and floor seriously now. Beam and vault are the ones which hurt my feet and I can't really upgrade enough to be up there to contend for the all around anymore. I've also changed my training partner and now I train with Hannah Whelan. The variety has given me a new lease of life.\""]}, {"page": "Imogen Cairns", "response": ["Having stepped in to replace Jones, Cairns competed at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing alongside teammates Becky Downie, Marissa King, Beth Tweddle, Hannah Whelan, and Rebecca Wing.
