A reference to the death of Bishop Bonner in September 1569 shows that the piece was produced after that date.", "Critics objecting to the style of Cambyses have doubted whether the playwright may not have been a different Thomas Preston.  M. Channing Linthicum lists some of these possibilities:Those who dislike to think of Cambyses as even a puerile attempt of the Latin scholar Thomas Preston, may entertain Chambers' suggestion that it may have been composed by a popular writer of the same name.  He mentions, (Elizabethan Stage, III, 469), a \"quarterly waiter at Court\" under Edward VI, and a choirmaster at Windsor.  A \"gentleman waiter\" of this name was detailed to the service of the Princess of Castile in 1514 (see Letters & Papers of Henry VIII, I, ii, entry 2656 [6]); a Thomas Preston was rewarded by Princess Mary Tudor, 1537 (see Madden, Privy Purse Expenses of Princess Mary, 59); in 1544, Thomas Preston\u2014presumably the same person\u2014was granted, as the King's \"servant\" a tenement \"called le Crystofer in St Botulphs parishe without Aldrychgate\" (see Letters & Papers of Henry VIII, XIX, i, p. 644); \"le messuage called le White Beare\" was said in 1548, to have been \"lately in tenure of Thomas Preston\" (see Cal. Pat. Rolls, July 25, 1548, m. 34).  None of these\u2014if they were different persons\u2014is termed writer or \"player,\" but the references show that the name was not uncommon in London, and the subject needs to be investigated.M. Channing Linthicum, \"The Date of Cambyses,\" PMLA, Vol. 49, No. 3. (Sep., 1934), pp. 959\u2013961, p. 960 n. 2", "Preston (or the author of Cambyses) also wrote a broadside ballad entitled A Lamentation from Rome how the Pope doth bewayle the Rebelles in England cannot prevayle. To the tune of \"Rowe well, ye mariners\" (London by William Griffith, 1570; reprinted in Collier's Old Ballads, edited for the Percy Society, and in the Borderer's Table Book by Moses Aaron Richardson, vii. 154).Collier, i. 210. This ballad is written \"in the person of a fly who happens to be lodged in the pope's nose when news comes about the Catholic uprising in the north of England\" and describes the pope raging and hurling furniture, to the fly's terror.Bruce R.
