L. Davies FRSC is a British chemist who has been Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Organic Chemistry at Emory University since 2008.Born in Aberystwyth, Wales he graduated with a first-class degree in Chemistry from Cardiff University in 1977 and completed his PhD at the University of East Anglia in 1980. After a post-doctoral position at Princeton University he joined the faculty at Wake Forest University where he became a full professor. He subsequently joined the University at Buffalo where he held the positions of UB Distinguished Professor and Larkin Professor of Organic Chemistry. In 2008, he moved to Emory University.\nProfessor Davies\u2019 research involves the development of new synthetic methods and their applications in total synthesis and drug discovery. His program covers design of chiral catalysts, carbenoid chemistry, development of new synthetic methodology, total synthesis of biologically active natural products, and development of chiral therapeutic agents. Many research groups have used his chiral dirhodium catalysts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hugh Davies", "response": ["Hugh or Huw Davies may refer to:", "* Huw Davies (rugby union) (born 1959), English rugby union player", "* Huw Davies (British artist), a British filmmaker and photographer currently working as a lens media at the University of Derby ", "* Huw Davies (chemist), British chemist", "* Huw Davies, author of Bunny, a webcomic", "* Huw Davies (actor), Welsh actor, in The Worst Journey in the World"]}, {"page": "Huw", "response": ["*Huw Davies (chemist), British chemist", "*Huw Davies (rugby union) (born 1959), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Wendy Young", "response": ["Young received her B.S. and M.S. from Wake Forest University, working with Prof. Huw Davies. She was co-author on an early application of Davies' rhodium(II) carbenoid insertion - Cope rearrangement chemistry, leading to the total synthesis of three small tropane natural products. Young received her Ph.D. from Princeton in 1993, working with Edward C. Taylor on heterocycles derived from natural pigments, one of which ultimately became pemetrexed (Alimta), an oncology treatment. In her postdoctoral fellowship with Samuel Danishefsky, Young was among one of a handful of groups in the mid-1990s to synthesize paclitaxel (Taxol), a highly-oxygenated terpenoid natural product used to treat cancer."]}, {"page": "Peter J.

He received his undergraduate degree with first class honors in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry from Loughborough University in 2001, after conducting research with Raymond Jones. He subsequently obtained his PhD in organic chemistry from Durham University in 2005, where he was a member of Ustinov College, under the mentorship of Patrick G. Steel. Scott then moved to the United States to undertake postdoctoral research in organometallic chemistry at SUNY Buffalo under Huw Davies, and PET radiochemistry at the University of Michigan with Michael Kilbourn."]}]}}
