He is best remembered for his 1902 novel of courage and cowardice in wartime, The Four Feathers and is also known as the creator of Inspector Hanaud, a French detective who was an early template for Agatha Christie's famous Hercule Poirot.\nHis prolific output in short stories and novels were frequently made and remade into films during his lifetime; though many of the silent versions have been lost or forgotten, the productions of Fire Over England (1937) and The Four Feathers (1939) remain enduring classics of British cinema.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hercule Poirot", "response": ["Poirot also bears a striking resemblance to A.

While the English residents were outspokenly pro-British, and many of their Wyoming-born sons went to Canada and joined the Canadian Armed Forces in order to serve in the war on England's side, they nonetheless made sure that their German co-workers and neighbors were not harassed or discriminated against.  In late 1917 one English rancher referred to the effort as making sure that his German neighbor was always \"treated like a gentleman.\"  Another English rancher said that two of his ranch hands were from Germany and he \"would hate to see the foolishness of national hatreds inflicted on men as decent as they are.\"  English residents of Big Horn County went out of their way to make sure that German-born residents did not feel unwelcome.  German immigrants and their Wyoming-born children were not \"anti-British\" though they favored America remaining neutral in the conflict.  Before the war the most commonly read works of fiction among German-born residents of Big Horn County were German language translations of British adventure stories including The Four Feathers by A. E. W. Mason as well as Sherlock Holmes stories and The Light That Failed by Rudyard Kipling.  Consensus among Big Horn County residents of all backgrounds after the war was that the war had ultimately been a tragedy and a \"horrible waste of human life.\"Wyoming in World War I by Dale A.

He paid for the pavilion at Stanway cricket ground. In 1887, he founded an amateur cricket team for friends of similarly limited playing ability, and named it the Allahakbarries under the mistaken belief that \"Allah akbar\" meant \"Heaven help us\" in Arabic (rather than \"God is great\"). Some of the best known British authors from the era played on the team at various times, including H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Conan Doyle, P. G. Wodehouse, Jerome K. Jerome, G. K. Chesterton, A. A. Milne, E. W. Hornung, A. E. W. Mason, Walter Raleigh, E. V. Lucas, Maurice Hewlett, Owen Seaman (editor of Punch), Bernard Partridge, George Cecil Ives, George Llewelyn Davies (see below) and the son of Alfred Tennyson. In 1891, Barrie joined the newly formed Authors Cricket Club and also played for its cricket team, the Authors XI, alongside Doyle, Wodehouse and Milne. The Allahakbarries and the Authors XI continued to exist side by side until 1912."]}, {"page": "Andrew Lang", "response": ["* Parson Kelly (1899) Co-written with A. E. W.

It has, among other things, represented cowardice or conscientious pacifism; as in A. E. W. Mason's 1902 book, The Four Feathers. In Britain during the First World War it was often given to men out of uniform by women to shame them publicly into signing up.  In the United States armed forces, however, it is used to signify extraordinary bravery and excellence in combat marksmanship.", "The Four Feathers (1902), an adventure novel, by A. E. W. Mason, tells of Harry Feversham, an officer in the British Army, who decides to resign his commission the day before his regiment is dispatched to fight in Sudan (the 1882 First War of Sudan, leading to the fall of Khartoum). Harry's three fellow officers and his fianc\u00e9e conclude that he is resigning to avoid fighting in the conflict, and each send him a white feather.  Stung by the criticism, Harry sails to Sudan, disguises himself as an Arab, and looks for the opportunity to redeem his honour. He manages this by fighting a covert war on behalf of the British, saving the life of one of his colleagues in the process.
