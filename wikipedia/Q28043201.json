Formerly involved with the English Defence League (EDL), she left due to its association with drink-fuelled violence. She then joined the far-right fascist political organisation Britain First. With Paul Golding as Leader, Fransen served as Deputy Leader from 2014 to 2019. She became acting leader for six months from December 2016 to June 2017, while Golding was imprisoned in December 2016. \nFransen was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2014 Rochester and Strood by-election, the 2016 London Assembly election and the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. In addition to online anti-Islamic activism, she has marched while holding a white cross, in what she called \"Christian patrols\", through predominantly Muslim populated areas of Britain. In March 2018, she was sentenced to 36 weeks imprisonment after being convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Piers Morgan", "response": ["Morgan criticised Trump after Trump had retweeted Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of the small far-right fascist party Britain First, in late November 2017.

Although campaigning against Islamic extremism, intolerance and religious fascism is not just acceptable but necessary, some groups which do so are totally unacceptable because they themselves promote extremism, intolerance or fascism. Britain First is squarely in that category.\""]}]}}
