Greatly more experienced and accomplished, Cuthbert was the 1927 BBoC British featherweight champion.  Nonetheless, showing immense talent at an early stage in his career, Mizler's title victory was only his tenth professional fight. Cuthbert was more aggressive in the early rounds, but was unable to connect with sting in his blows, but Mizler's defense improved throughout the fight and he was often brilliant in the use of his left against Cuthbert.  In the third and fourth, Mizler clearly began to use his left more effectively.  In the closing two rounds, Mizler finally had enough of an advantage to try for a knockout against his opponent but was unable.  Cuthbert had continued to connect with blows in previous rounds, but with less frequency and with less effect than Mizler.  It was a fast and clean fight, and the referee had little need to call fouls.\"Mizler Defeats Cuthbert\", Manchester Guardian, Manchester, England, pg. 3, 19 January 1934 ", "| Johnny Cuthbert"]}, {"page": "Andr\u00e9 Routis", "response": ["From August 1926 to August 1927 Routis fought exclusively in the United States (9 wins, 5 losses and 1 draw).
