By this time a procedure for determining whether the ring of all algebraic integers of a given quadratic field \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) is a PID was well known to the quadratic form theorists.  Especially, Gauss had looked at the case of imaginary quadratic fields: he found exactly nine values of D < 0 for which the ring of integers is a PID and conjectured that there were no further values.  (Gauss' conjecture was proven more than one hundred years later by Kurt Heegner, Alan Baker and Harold Stark.)  However, this was understood (only) in the language of equivalence classes of quadratic forms, so that in particular the analogy between quadratic forms and the Fermat equation seems not to have been perceived.  In 1847 Gabriel Lam\u00e9 announced a solution of Fermat's Last Theorem for all n > 2; that is, that the Fermat equation has no solutions in nonzero integers, but it turned out that his solution hinged on the assumption that the cyclotomic ring \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_n] is a UFD.  Ernst Kummer had shown three years before that this was not the case already for n = 23 (the full, finite list of values for which \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_n] is a UFD is now known).  At the same time, Kummer developed powerful new methods to prove Fermat's Last Theorem at least for a large class of prime exponents n using what we now recognize as the fact that the ring \\mathbb{Z}[\\zeta_n] is a Dedekind domain.  In fact Kummer worked not with ideals but with \"ideal numbers\", and the modern definition of an ideal was given by Dedekind."]}, {"page": "Effective results in number theory", "response": ["Later results, particularly of Alan Baker, changed the position.
