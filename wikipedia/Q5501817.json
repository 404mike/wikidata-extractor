His own paper, The Porcupine, bearing the motto \"Fear God, Honour the King\", started up on 30 October 1800, but without success, and he sold his interest in it in 1801. Less than a month later, however, he started the Political Register, a weekly newspaper that appeared almost every week from January 1802 until 1835, the year of Cobbett's death.

For a time indeed seduced by the love of what I thought liberty I ventured to oppose your Opinions without ever ceasing to venerate your character...I cannot say...that I can even now assent to all your opinions on the present politics of Europe. But I can with truth affirm that I subscribe to your general Principles; that I consider them as the only solid foundation both of political Science and of political prudence\".R. B.

However, in private Burke was sceptical of what he considered Mackintosh's \"supposed conversion\".Burke wrote to his friend French Laurence on 25 December: \"I suspect by his Letter that it does not extend beyond the interior politicks of this Island, but that, with regard to France and many other Countries He remains as franc a Jacobin as ever. This conversion is none at all, but we must nurse up these nothings and think these negative advantages as we can have them\". McDowell and Woods, pp. 204\u2013205. Burke invited Mackintosh to spend Christmas with him at his home in Beaconsfield, where he was struck by Burke's \"astonishing effusions of his mind in conversation.
