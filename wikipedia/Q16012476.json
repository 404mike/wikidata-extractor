Another love interest of the reluctant McHale is an old friend and a bit of a wildcat Kate O'Hara (Joyce Jameson). At first, his crew tries to get McHale interested in her, then Kate tries to blackmail McHale into marrying her and then Binghamton tries to blackmail her into marrying McHale when she tries to back out herself. Yet another love interest of the always reluctant McHale is Maggie Monohan (Jean Willes) in \"The Return of Maggie,\" the owner of a gambling joint in New Caledonia and an old flame of McHale's who wants him back, but he does not want her back (Willes played a very similar role as Margot Monet in the 1964 movie). Willes also played Congresswoman Clara Carter Clarke in \"Send Us a Hero.\" Though painfully shy around women, Ensign Parker's love interest in the South Pacific is Yvette Gerard, a lovely French girl from a nearby island played by Claudine Longet (who also played an almost identical character, Andrea Bouchard of New Caledonia, in the 1964 movie). In \"A Medal for Parker,\" his girlfriend back home in Chagrin Falls is Mary (Kathleen Gately), who is more interested in dating a war hero than Parker. While the very bashful Parker is shy around women, women are not always shy around Parker, such as in \"The Happy Sleepwalker\" when Lt. Nancy Culpepper (Sheila James) finds Parker irresistible. In \"The Vampire of Taratupa,\" Parker dates Lt. Melba Benson (Ann Elder), who is as big a klutz as he is. In the episode entitled \"36-24-73,\" situated in Italy, hints are given of a relationship developing between Parker and by-the-book female Ensign Sandra Collins (Maura McGiveney) after he sternly corrects her about in what sections certain regulations are (they then talk about what regulations are their favorites). Along with other WAVES clad in bathing suits, they provide valuable (albeit totally unwitting) assistance in capturing a German U-boat when its captain runs the U-boat aground trying to get a better look. McGiveney also played the part of Judy in \"The Stool Parrot\" episode. Although the crew (especially the lover-boy Virgil) is forever chasing women (Navy nurses, native island girls or local Italian women), certain women gain their interest more than others. After receiving a \"Dear John letter,\" shy and broken-hearted Willy's love interest becomes Southern belle Nurse Cindy Bates (Brenda Wright). Tinker tries to impress and win over fickle Nurse Betsy Gordonlove (Barbara Werle) in \"Scuttlebutt.\" Happy's love interest in \"The Happy Sleepwalker\" is Lt. Anne Wright (Lois Roberts). When Gruber's girlfriend Ginger (Jean Hale) shows up to surprise him in \"Lester, the Skipper,\" McHale is talked into letting Gruber pretend he is the commander of the PT-73 while she is there. In \"Fuji's Big Romance,\" the lonely prisoner of war falls for lovely Sulani (Yvonne Ribuca), the daughter of a Polynesian chief, when the crew sympathetically takes him along on one of their social outings to a luau with the native islanders. Other than Binghamton and Christy, none of the regular characters on the show is married and only Christy has any children."]}, {"page": "List of General Hospital characters", "response": [":(Maura McGiveney, temp. 1971)"]}, {"page": "Audrey Hardy", "response": ["Rachel Ames originated the role of Audrey in 1964 in what was originally a thirteen-week stint with an option for an additional thirteen weeks.
