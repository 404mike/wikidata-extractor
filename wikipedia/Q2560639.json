The group came to prominence playing rhythm and blues. They made some changes in musicians but settled on a line-up of Pinder, Thomas, Edge, guitarist Justin Hayward, and bassist John Lodge, who stayed together for most of the band's \"classic era\" into the early 1970s. Edge was the group\u2019s sole continuous member throughout their entire history.", "The Moody Blues formed in 1964 in Erdington, a suburb of Birmingham in the county of Warwickshire.  Ray Thomas, a young John Lodge and (occasionally) Mike Pinder had been members of El Riot & the Rebels. They disbanded when Lodge, the youngest member, went to technical college and Pinder joined the army. Pinder then rejoined Thomas to form the Krew Cats. Back from a disappointing spell in the Hamburg region a few months later,as told by Thomas in Pete Frame\u00b4s Rock Family Trees: Birmingham Beatsters the pair recruited guitarist/vocalist Denny Laine and band manager-turned-drummer Graeme Edge. Pinder and Thomas initially approached their former El Riot bandmate John Lodge about being the bass player, but Lodge declined as he was still in college.  They instead recruited bassist Clint Warwick. The five appeared as the Moody Blues for the first time in Birmingham in 1964. The name developed from a hoped-for sponsorship from the Mitchells & Butlers Brewery which failed to materialise, the band calling themselves both \"The M Bs\" and \"The M B Five\", and was also a subtle reference to the Duke Ellington song \"Mood Indigo\". In an interview it was revealed that the band was named \"Moody Blues\" because Mike Pinder was interested in how music changes people's moods and due to the fact that the band was playing blues at the time. Around this time the band were the resident group at the Carlton Ballroom, later to become rock music venue Mothers on Erdington High Street.", "Deram executives were initially sceptical about the hybrid style of the resulting concept album. Released in November 1967, Days of Future Passed peaked at No. 27 on the British LP chart. Five years later it reached No. 3 on the Billboard chart in the US. The LP was a song cycle or concept album that takes place over the course of a single day.  The album drew inspiration in production and arrangement from the pioneering use of the classical instrumentation by the Beatles, to whom Pinder had introduced the mellotron that year. It took the form to new heights using the London Festival Orchestra, a loose affiliation of Decca's classical musicians given a fictitious name, adding the term \"London\" to sound impressive, to provide an orchestral linking framework to the Moodies' already written and performed songs, plus overture and conclusion sections on the album, including backing up Graeme Edge's opening and closing poems recited by Pinder. Strings were added to the latter portion of the album version of Hayward's \"Nights in White Satin\" (absent on the single) but the orchestra and group never performed together on the recording, with the band's rock instrumentation centred on Pinder's mellotron. Despite being a lush concept album, the LP was cut in a very workmanlike manner, with the band recording a particular song, then the track being presented to Peter Knight who quickly composed a suitable \"linking\" orchestral portion, which the Decca musicians (\"London Festival Orchestra\") then recorded. The album was as much an original work by Knight himself as the group. The composing credits were listed on the sleeve as: \"Redwave-Knight\", although Hayward wrote \"Nights...\" and \"Tuesday Afternoon\", Thomas provided \"Another Morning\" and \"Twilight Time\", Lodge penned \"Peak Hour\" and \"Evening (Time To Get Away)\", and Edge contributed the opening and closing poems (the first \"Morning Glory\" and the latter titled \"Late Lament\") read by Mike Pinder who composed both \"The Sun Set\" and \"Dawn is a Feeling\" (sung by Hayward, with Pinder singing the bridge section).", "The 1968 follow-up LP, In Search of the Lost Chord included \"Legend of a Mind\", a song written by Ray Thomas in tribute to LSD guru Timothy Leary which encompassed a flute solo performed by Thomas \u2013 four members of the group had taken LSD together at the start of 1967. A promotional film for the song was filmed on location at Groot-Bijgaarden Castle near Brussels in Belgium. Lodge provided a two-part song \"House of Four Doors\" set either side of Thomas' epic piece. Justin Hayward began playing sitar and incorporating it into Moody Blues music (\"Voices...\", \"Visions of Paradise\", \"Om\", etc.), having been inspired by George Harrison. Hayward's \"Voices in the Sky\" charted as a single in the UK (No. 27), as did Lodge's \"Ride My See-Saw\" (No. 42, No. 15 in France) \u2013 still their concert finale number \u2013 which featured Pinder's non-album song \"A Simple Game\" as the 'B' side. Pinder's \"The Best Way to Travel\" was another high point, as was his closing song \"Om\" (sung by Pinder and Thomas, again featuring Hayward on sitar). Graeme Edge found a significant secondary role in the band as a writer of poetry, and some of their early albums from the late 1960s began with various band members reciting poems by Edge that were conceptually related to the lyrics of the songs that  followed. Edge narrated his brief \"Departure\" poem on \"Lost Chord\", although Pinder recited the majority of Edge's poetry, as according to Edge, he had the best voice for it due to smoking more cigarettes and drinking more whisky at the time.", "In an interview following the release of Seventh Sojourn, Graeme Edge told Rolling Stone: \"We've got two Christians, one Mystic, one Pedantic and one Mess, and we all get on a treat.\"", "From 1991 to 1998 the group took a hiatus from recording and spent time trying to perfect the art of performing live with an orchestra. The recording hiatus ended in 1999, with the album Strange Times, their first album in almost two decades to be more than moderately received by British critics, although Justin Hayward was quoted as saying he was disappointed at the album's chart performance, which was notably less than Keys of the Kingdom in 1991. It was recorded in Recco, Italy, at Hayward's suggestion, and was the band's first self-produced effort. The album featured keyboards and arrangements from Italian musician Danilo Madonia, who continued to work in-studio with the band. The album opened with \"English Sunset\" a pop song featuring a modern, nearly techno arrangement. The song \"This Is the Moment\" (which is not on Strange Times), which was originally featured in the Broadway production of Jekyll and Hyde, was a minor hit in the US. Strange Times was also the first album since 1970 to include a new poem by Graeme Edge, \"Nothing Changes\", narrated by Edge, with Hayward then singing the concluding portion of the track, and notably concluded by quoting Mike Pinder's 1968 song title \"A Simple Game\". Also in 1999, the Moody Blues appeared in an episode of The Simpsons called Viva Ned Flanders. On Strange Times Ray Thomas appeared vocally with Hayward and Lodge on \"Sooner or Later (Walkin' on Air)\" and his own brief song \"My Little Lovely\", plus provided a vocal snippet and backing vocals on Hayward's \"English Sunset\"; this was his recorded vocal swan song with the band.", "In 2007, the now defunct Hard Rock Park theme park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, announced the building of a dark ride entitled \"Nights in White Satin: The Trip\". The ride incorporated multi-sensory experiences as well as a re-orchestrated version of the song by Justin Hayward. A re-recorded version of Graeme Edge's \"Late Lament\" again followed, which had each group member reading a verse of the poem. In March 2009, the ride closed because of the conversion of the park to the Freestyle Music Park, with the new owners desiring to make the park more \"family friendly.\"", "Original vocalist and flautist Ray Thomas died on 4 January 2018, at the age of 76, just a few months before the band were due to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, at which the band gave what ultimately proved to be their final stage performance.

Space exploration would go on to become the theme of the group's 1969 album To Our Children's Children's Children, inspired by and dedicated to the Apollo 11 mission. The mysterious \"lost chord\" of the title is revealed to be the mantra \"Om\" (in the last stanza of Graeme Edge's poem \"The Word\").
