He was 35 years old, the son of Edmond James de Rothschild of the Paris branch of the Rothschild family.  In 1922 James de Rothschild inherited Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire. This became their country home.  They also had a London house in St James's Square.\nDorothy de Rothschild assisted her husband in his political campaigns, particularly from 1929 to 1945 when he was Liberal Member of Parliament for the Isle of Ely constituency.\nAfter his death in 1957, Waddesdon Manor was bequeathed to the National Trust, but the surrounding estate and smaller mansion at Eythrope in Buckinghamshire were retained by Mrs. de Rothschild and bequeathed to her husband's great nephew Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild. She remained a strong influence on the preservation and development of the house and collections at Waddesdon.\nDorothy de Rothschild continued the Zionist interests of her father-in-law and husband, and was a close friend of Chaim Weizmann. She became chairman of Yad Hanadiv, the Rothschild family charities in Israel, and saw through her husband's gift of funds to build the Knesset and her own gift of the Supreme Court of Israel building.\nAt her death in 1988, she left \u00a394,117,964 (equivalent to \u00a3258 million in 2020), the largest probated estate to that date in England and Wales.\nShe is buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 10", "response": ["*  1988   \u2013 Dorothy de Rothschild, English philanthropist and activist (b. 1895)"]}, {"page": "Rothschild family", "response": ["Baron Edmond James de Rothschild (known in Israel simply as \"the baron Rothschild\"), youngest son of James Jacob de Rothschild, was a patron of the first permanent settlement in Palestine at Rishon-LeZion (1882). He also provided funding for the establishment of Petah Tikva as a permanent settlement (1883). Overall, he bought from Ottoman landlords 2-3% of the land which now makes up present-day Israel. After Baron de Hirsch died in 1896, the Hirsch-founded Jewish Colonisation Association (ICA) started supporting the settlement of Palestine (1896), and Baron Rothschild took an active role in the organization and transferred his Palestinian land holdings as well as 15 million francs to it. In 1924, he reorganized the Palestinian branch of the ICA into the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association (PICA), which acquired more than  of land and set up business ventures.Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, vol. 2, \"Rothschild, Baron Edmond-James de,\" p. 966 In Tel Aviv, the Rothschild Boulevard is named after him, as are a number of localities throughout Israel which he assisted in founding, including Metulla, Zikhron Ya'akov, Rishon Lezion and Rosh Pina.

From 1914, \"a benevolent goodwill toward the Zionist idea\" emerged in Britain when intelligence revealed how the Jewish Question could support imperial interests against the Ottomans.Stein, Balfour Declaration, p.109; Samuel, Memoirs, p.139; Schneer, p.123 Many of Weizmann's contacts revealed the extent of the uncertainty in Palestine. From 1914 to 1918, Weizmann developed his political skills mixing easily in powerful circles. On 7 and 8 November 1914, he had a meeting with Dorothy de Rothschild. Her husband James de Rothschild was serving with the French Army, but she was unable to influence her cousinhood to Weizmann's favour. However, when Weizmanm spoke to Charles, second son of Nathan Mayer Rothschild, he approved the idea. James de Rothschild advised Weizmann seek to influence the British Government. By the time he reached Lord Robert Cecil, Dr Weizmann was enthused with excitement. Cecil's personal foibles were representative of class consciousness, which the Zionists overcame through deeds rather than words. C. P. Scott, the editor of The Manchester Guardian, formed a friendship with Weizmann after the two men encountered each other at a Manchester garden party in 1915. Scott described the diminutive leader asextraordinarily interesting, a rare combination of idealism and the severely practical which are the two essentials of statesmanship a perfectly clear sense conception of Jewish nationalism, an intense and burning sense of the Jew as Jew, just as strong, perhaps more so, as that of the German as German or the Englishman as Englishman, and secondly arising out of that and necessary for its satisfaction and development, his demand for a country, a home land which for him and for anyone during his view of Jewish nationality can be no other that the ancient home of his race.Weizmann, Trial and Error, i, p.149"]}, {"page": "Rothschild", "response": ["* Dorothy de Rothschild (n\u00e9e Pinto 1895\u20131988), English philanthropist, wife of James Armand de Rothschild"]}, {"page": "Eythrope", "response": ["Dorothy de Rothschild died in 1988 leaving the estate and Pavilion to her husband's great nephew, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild.

The science labs are contained in the Parker building. The Dorothy de Rothschild building, which was opened by Lord and Lady Rothschild in 1999, houses the school's Maths and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) departments, and is now the home of the Maths & Computing specialism. The Thorp building is named after the Reverend Tom Thorp, a former Chairman of Governors, who died in office in 2003. The building was officially opened in 2005 and named in his memory. It includes a teaching block that houses the Modern Languages department, a suite of art studios and a sports hall. In 2007 the school added a new all-weather pitch to its sports facilities.
