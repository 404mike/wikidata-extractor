Rogers (15 August 1902 \u2013 1 July 1990) was a British author and physics educator. He is perhaps best known for his 1960 textbook Physics for the Inquiring Mind. The book, subtitled The Methods, Nature, and Philosophy of Physical Science, was based on courses he gave at Princeton University, where he taught from 1942 to 1971. Rogers also headed the Nuffield Science Teaching Project program in physics education in the 1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oersted Medal", "response": ["* Eric M.

The physics project was organised first, under Donald McGill; the chemistry project was under H. F. Halliwell, and the biology project under W. H. Dowdeswell. The initial focus on the course to 'O' level was extended to 'A' level and a Junior Science Project on primary school teaching was added by 1966;Clark, pp. 171\u201373.Waring, pp. 86\u201387, 94. later in the 1960s Nuffield also began a Combined Science Project, a Secondary Science Project for pupils who would not take 'O' levels, the Nuffield Language Teaching Programme in modern languages, and programmes in mathematics, classics, and social studies.Clark, p. 173.Donnelly and Jenkins, p. 29. McGill died in March 1963 and was succeeded at the physics project by Eric M. Rogers.Woolnough, pp. 96\u201398.Lewis, pp. 156\u201357. John Maddox was added as an assistant director of the foundation and coordinator of the project as a whole. In 1966 the development phase came to an end and teachers' guides, pupils' question books and other material were published in time for the school year starting in autumn 1967.Waring, p. 193. Nuffield sponsored Area Committees, training of tutors to train teachers, television programmes on teaching Nuffield science, and two films showing actual chemistry classrooms: Exploring Chemistry and Chemistry by Investigation.Waring, pp. 195\u2013203. The Local Education Authority teachers' centres and specialist centres at teacher training institutions also provided training in Nuffield methods;Waring, p. 202. the project itself established the Centre for Science Education at Chelsea College, which was able to grant degrees.Rob Walker, \"Getting Involved in Curriculum Research: A Personal History\", in Martin Lawn and Len Barton, eds., Rethinking Curriculum Studies: A Radical Approach, 1981, 2nd ed.
