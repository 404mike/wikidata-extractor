In contrast, the Evening Standard found it \"laughable \u2013 when it is not revolting by reason of the sentimentality with which the autobiography of Rupert Ray is sticky from cover to cover\". Rose Macaulay, writing in the Daily News, thought it \"apparently by a rather illiterate and commonplace sentimentalist\", and considered that the book had \"no beauty, and its silliness and bad taste are not the work of a writer\". S. P. B. Mais thought it \"[a] quite unreadable novel about public school life and the war\"; while Francis Birrell judged it \"the most nauseating book to have come out of the war\".
