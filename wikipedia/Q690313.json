On 10 August 2013, Law played his first League match for Rangers against Brechin City, scoring one goal in a 4\u20131 victory and providing a double assist for Chris Hegarty for the first goal and Dean Shiels for the fourth goal. Since joining Rangers, manager McCoist says Law is responsible for helping the club by bringing \"real calmness\" and \"an attacking edge\". In the club's second game of 2014, Law scored a brace, as Rangers won 2\u20130 against Stenhousemuir on 5 January 2014. At the conclusion of the winter transfer, Manager McCoist revealed an English club had attempted to sign Law, only the bid was to be rejected, as it was felt the bidding club tried to take advantage of Rangers' financial problem, which turned out to be Blackpool. Law started for Rangers in the 1\u20130 loss to Raith Rovers in the 2014 Challenge Cup Final, where he missed a number of chances.
