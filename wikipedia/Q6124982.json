A bespectacled cricketer, Seamer was a right-handed batsman who played with a defensive streak to his game which was rarely seen among amateur batsmen of his time. He was described as a leg break googly bowler, but in truth he rarely bowled at all, and claimed just four first-class wickets.\nSeamer played the best of his cricket while at Oxford University. All four of his first-class centuries were made for the university side, and his average for Oxford was 35.30, significantly higher than his career average of 20.35. He made his highest score against Free Foresters in his second year, during which he accrued 858 runs, more than double he managed in any other season. On completion of his studies at Oxford, Seamer joined the Sudan Political Service, which limited his first-class cricket appearances to periods of leave. He was named as one of three amateurs to captain Somerset in 1948, leading the team during June and July. That season was his last for Somerset, and he made only one further first-class appearance. He became a district commissioner in the Sudan, and after leaving the service, he taught at Marlborough College and was twice mayor of Marlborough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Seamer", "response": ["* Jake Seamer (1913\u20132006), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Mandy Mitchell-Innes", "response": ["While at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes had become good friends with Jake Seamer, who had also attended Brasenose College, and the pair were teammates for both Oxford and Somerset. Seamer had joined the Sudan Political Service (SPS) on his graduation in 1936,Foot (1986), p. 128. and while at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes also secured a role with the organisation that he would take up after his graduation. His duties with the SPS prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1938, but he made seven early-season appearances the following year, though two were for the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Free Foresters. It was for the latter of these that Mitchell-Innes made his only century of the season; playing against Oxford University, the Free Foresters required nearly 400 runs in the fourth innings to win. Mitchell-Innes opened the innings, and after the lunch interval on the final day he played attacking cricket, bringing up his century in 95 minutes. He was eventually dismissed for 143 runs, bowled as he tried to heave an on drive. The Free Foresters came within nine runs of their target, but were bowled out before they could reach it. In total, he scored 347 runs at 31.54 that year; the last season of first-class county cricket in England before it was interrupted by the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2006", "response": ["*Jake Seamer, 92, English cricketer."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset cricket captains", "response": ["Between 1894 and 1946, the club captaincy remained reasonably stable, six official captains spanned the 52-year period.  In addition to Woods, John Daniell, Jack White and Reggie Ingle all captained the side on more than 150 occasions, and Lionel Palairet led the team for one season and Massey Poyntz for two.  Bunty Longrigg was captain of the side either side of the Second World War, totalling 73 matches.  In contrast, the following nine years saw the club utilise eight different official captains, and a number more unofficial ones.  Jack Meyer, who went on to found Millfield, stood down at the end of 1947, his first season as captain.  In 1948, the club committee claimed that it was unable to find anyone of suitable pedigree to lead the side for the whole summer, and was forced to name three captains for the season.  Mandy Mitchell-Innes led the side throughout the pre-season and for the first five matches of the County Championship during leave from the Sudan Political Service. The captaincy then passed onto Jake Seamer, also on leave from the Sudan Political Service, for seven matches, before the committee settled on George Woodhouse, who remained in the position for the following 1949 season.Foot (1986), pp155\u2013156. The next three captains \u2013 Stuart Rogers, Ben Brocklehurst and Gerry Tordoff \u2013 all captained the side for three seasons or less, and in the words of cricket writer and Somerset County Cricket Club historian David Foot, \"captaincy had, ever since the war... been a matter of recurrent concern.\"Foot (1986), p169. This concern, and the fact that there was a lack of amateurs with the necessary time and money to dedicate to the role, meant that in 1956 the club appointed Maurice Tremlett to the role, the county's first professional captain."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jake Seamer (1932\u20131948) 59 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Michael Walford", "response": ["Walford was playing county standard rugby union before he went up to Trinity College, Oxford, in autumn 1934.

But within four weeks he was also playing for the rugby first fifteen as several players were rested in advance of the University Match. Hockey, however, remained Walford's main winter game in his first year at Oxford and he was awarded his Blue by the hockey captain, Jake Seamer, later to be a cricket colleague at Somerset: the match with Cambridge finished as a goal-less draw."]}, {"page": "George Woodhouse", "response": ["In 1948, Somerset struggled to find a full-time captain, and Woodhouse officially shared the job with Mandy Mitchell-Innes and Jake Seamer, though at least two other players captained the side for occasional matches. In 1949, Woodhouse took over the captaincy full-time and played his only full season of cricket: he made 849 runs, though his highest score was only 59, at an average just below 20 runs an innings. He led the team to equal ninth in the County Championship table, and only three matches all season were drawn. But at the end of the season he stepped down to go into the family business, and he played only a few more times in first-class cricket, finally finishing in 1953."]}, {"page": "Vincent's Club", "response": ["| Jake Seamer||1936||"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1948", "response": ["In the 1948 season, Somerset County Cricket Club competed in the County Championship, finishing twelfth out of seventeen teams. They were officially captained by three amateurs through the season; initially by Mandy Mitchell-Innes; then by Jake Seamer; and finally by George Woodhouse. The strains on consistent leadership were reflected in Somerset's variable form: after failing to win their first eight matches. Somerset did not win, lose or draw twice in consecutive matches in their following eight matches. In all, they won five times that season, and depended heavily upon the batting of Harold Gimblett, who scored 1,741 runs, and was Somerset's only player to score a century.", "As a result of Meyer's resignation, the Somerset committee was once more required to recruit a captain for the following season.

So, with no single candidate suitable, the Somerset committee announced that the club would be captained by three players; first by Mandy Mitchell-Innes and then by Jake Seamer during their respective periods of leave from the Sudan Political Service. Once both of these had returned to their duties, George Woodhouse would take over.Roebuck (1991), p. 242.

He played minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire from 1926 to 1935, making seventy appearances, the last of which came against Cambridgeshire. Playing minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire allowed Rawlins to be selected to play for a combined Minor Counties cricket team, who he made his first-class debut for against Lancashire at Old Trafford in 1930. The Minor Counties won the toss and elected to bat first, making 216 all out, with Rawlins being dismissed for a duck by Len Hopwood. Lancashire then made 188 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by reaching nine without loss, at which point the match was curtailed by rain and declared a draw. He later made a second first-class appearance for the team against Oxford University at the University Parks in 1934. The Minor Counties won the toss and elected to bat first, making 539/8 declared, with Rawlins scoring 74 runs before he was dismissed by Kenneth Jackson. Oxford University then made 469 all out in their first-innings, to which the Minor Counties responded in their second-innings by reaching 129/4, with Rawlins scoring 36 runs before he was dismissed by Jake Seamer.
