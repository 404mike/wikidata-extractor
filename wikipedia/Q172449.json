In 1952 he and Jack Fairman drove the works J2X, chassis number 3055, fitted with a Chrysler hemi engine, where the car retired at 6.30 a.m. having thrown a rod.Motor Sport, July 1952, Page 314. In 1953 he shared a Cadillac-engined Allard J2R with Philip Fotheringham-Parker, leading the race at the end of the first lap, but on lap four he was the first to retire with collapsed rear suspension and a severed brake pipe.Motor Sport, July 1953, Pages 340/341. In 1952 and 1953 a sister car was driven at Le Mans by Zora Arkus-Duntov, a one-time Allard employee.Corvette, 1968-1982, by Mike Mueller, Motorbooks, 2000, Page 94. Carroll Shelby also raced an Allard-Cadillac J2 in the United States early in his driving career. Thus the successful Allard formula of an American V8 engine in a light chassis inspired the development of the Chevrolet Corvette and the A.C. Shelby Cobra."]}, {"page": "1950 BRDC International Trophy", "response": ["|  Philip Fotheringham-Parker", "|  Philip Fotheringham-Parker"]}, {"page": "Maserati 4CL and 4CLT", "response": ["| Philip Fotheringham-Parker", "|align=\"left\"|  Philip Fotheringham-Parker"]}, {"page": "1951 Scottish Grand Prix", "response": ["The 1951 Scottish Grand Prix was a 50 lap  motor race held on 21 July 1951 at Winfield Airfield (disused) in Berwickshire.
