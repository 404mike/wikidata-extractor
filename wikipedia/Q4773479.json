According to film critic Daniel Eagan, Florey premiered the film in a movie club in Los Angeles; according to Anthony Slide, it opened at New York City's Cameo Theatre on June 17, 1928. David E. James said that the film had its true premiere at Charlie Chaplin's Beverly Hills villa. Chaplin, who had become disenchanted with many aspects of Hollywood filmmaking, was so impressed with the film that he watched it five times and screened it for guests at his home. His audience included film-industry elites including Douglas Fairbanks, John Considine, Harry d'Arrast, D. W. Griffith, Jesse L. Lasky, Ernst Lubitsch, Lewis Milestone, Mary Pickford, Joseph M. Schenck, Norma Talmadge, Josef von Sternberg, and King Vidor. Chaplin's screening was accompanied by a record of Rhapsody in Blue and the comedian playing the organ. Florey was so concerned about a negative reaction to the film's satire of Hollywood that he removed his name from the credits and hid in the projection room during the screening. Although the audience originally expected it to be one of Chaplin's gags, they were impressed with the film and Schenck arranged for it to begin screening at a United Artists theater on Broadway on March 21, 1928. A musical score, based on Rhapsody in Blue and played by a live orchestra (featuring the saxophone), was prepared by Hugo Riesenfeld for the showing.

For another interview in which Bunny describes his entrance into the film industry, see Agnew 1913, pp. 98\u2013100. Bunny, however, insisted on taking the lower pay and began working at Vitagraph Studios around 1910,Sources disagree on the exact date Bunny began working for the Vitagraph Company. As summarized by Anthony Slide, \"There is considerable question not only as to why [Bunny chose to work at] Vitagraph, but also as to when. According to William Basil Courtney, Bunny's name first appeared on the Vitagraph payroll on October 27, 1910. Albert E. Smith claims Bunny's first Vitagraph film was Doctor Cupid, released on January 10, 1911. Historian and archivist Sam Gill, who has undertaken extensive research into John Bunny's career, believes that his first screen appearance was in Jack Fat and Jim Slim at Coney Island, released on December 2, 1910. The only subject on which there is general agreement is Bunny's initial salary\u2014$40.00 a week\" (Slide & Gevinson 1987, p. 47). where he went on to star in over 150 films. At Vitagraph, Bunny was often paired with the comedian Flora Finch, with whom he made many popular comedies \u2013 often featuring situational humor in a domestic setting, in contrast with the rowdier slapstick style used in some films at the time \u2013 that came to be known as \"Bunnygraphs\" or \"Bunnyfinches\". According to the Library of Congress, the Bunnygraph genre was exemplified by A Cure for Pokeritis (1912), which features the efforts of a wife to put a stop to her husband's gambling habit by organizing a fake police raid on his weekly poker game.", "According to Frank Scheide, Bunny's films might have been taken more seriously because \"Bunny's humor was based more on comedy of manners than slapstick\", a \"polite\" and \"respectable\" form of situational comedy in contrast to the \"decidedly lowbrow, crass, and often violent\" humor of slapstick films. According to Gehring, Bunny was \"the first in a long line of American personality screen comedians\", whose approach is marked by a \"subordination of story to character\".Gehring 1995, p. 121. The personality focus of Bunny's films was also noted by the screenwriter Catherine Carr, who wrote in 1914: \"In most big companies at the present day there are maintained actors around whose personality comedies are being written; i.e., John Bunny, Flora Finch, etc. These actors take the mere germ of a comedy and develop it through their clever acting into a screen production that brings laughter wherever it is shown.\"* Modern viewers may not find Bunny's films as funny as Carr described, however. The film scholar Anthony Slide, for instance, writes that Bunny's \"characterizations contain nothing creative, and he uses no knockabout or slapstick comedy. His comedy is all very middle class and very polite. Often so dull is the storyline that the comedy is difficult to uncover. Time and again one wonders if audiences ever did laugh at his work, and, if so, why?\"Slide 2002, p. 59."]}, {"page": "Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9", "response": ["In the late 1940s, Guy-Blach\u00e9 wrote an autobiography; it was published, in French, in 1976, and was translated into English a decade later with the help of her daughter Simone, daughter-in-law Roberta Blach\u00e9, and the film writer Anthony Slide.

Clark achieved this process by using blank film rolls as a template on which he would manually assign Clayton's film negatives with hand-marked reel numbers, slate numbers, and time stamps indicating the duration each image should remain within a single frame. Clayton explained in later interviews that he felt the dissolves entirely appropriate and in accordance with his vision of the film as \"mood-oriented\", adding: \"It gave me opportunities to explore this field, which I had never done before: to create in those multiple dissolves images which hang there, and have a meaning which applies both to the end of the last scene and the beginning of the next.\""]}, {"page": "Gay literature", "response": ["Blair Niles's Strange Brother (1931), about the platonic relationship between a heterosexual woman and a gay man in New York City in the late 1920s and early 1930s, is an early, objective exploration of homosexual issues during the Harlem Renaissance.
