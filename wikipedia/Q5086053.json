After twelve months, he is released and returns to his wife, who gave birth to a boy during his captivity. The queen learns the whole story and insists the king bring his other son to live and play with his half-brother. One day, however, an old greybearded man foretold that one boy might kill the other in the future. Trying to avert the dismal fate, the son of the fairy woman, called Fach-M\u00f2hr-mac-Righ-na-Lirriach, leaves the kingdom and goes to the woods. He is then found by another king, Ossian-Righ-na-Faen, king of the Picts. Fach M\u00f3hr introduces himself as Gillie-na-Cochlan Crackenach and accompanies King Ossian to work for him. On his further adventures, he finds a vial of a powerful elixir named Flaggan Fiacallach; he is killed but resurrected with the vial, and later returns to his half-brother. Fach-M\u00f2hr/Gillie uses the vial on his ailing brother and both live happily.Dempster, Charlotte Louisa Hawkins. \"Folk-Lore of Sutherlandshire (September)\". In: The Folk-Lore Journal. Vol. VI.
