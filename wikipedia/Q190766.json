In 1946 Ryle and Derek Vonberg were the first people to publish interferometric astronomical measurements at radio wavelengths. With improved equipment, Ryle observed the most distant known galaxies in the universe at that time. He was the first Professor of Radio Astronomy in the University of Cambridge and founding director of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory. He was the twelfth Astronomer Royal from 1972 to 1982. Ryle and Antony Hewish shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. In the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Astronomer Royal", "response": ["| 12. ||  || Sir Martin Ryle || 1972 || 1982 || "]}, {"page": "Fred Hoyle", "response": ["Hoyle had a famously heated argument with Martin Ryle of the Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group about Hoyle's steady state theory, which somewhat restricted collaboration between the Cavendish group and the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy during the 1960s.Mitton, Simon, Fred Hoyle a life in science, Chapter 7, Cambridge University Press, 2011."]}, {"page": "October 14", "response": ["*1984 \u2013 Martin Ryle, English astronomer and physicist, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1918)"]}, {"page": "List of physicists", "response": ["*Martin Ryle \u2013 U.K. (1918\u20131984) Nobel laureate"]}, {"page": "September 27", "response": ["*1918 \u2013 Martin Ryle, English astronomer and author, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 1984)"]}, {"page": "Trinity College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Martin Ryle"]}, {"page": "1984", "response": ["* October 14 \u2013 Sir Martin Ryle, English radio astronomer, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics (b. 1918)"]}, {"page": "1918", "response": ["** Martin Ryle, English radio astronomer, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics (d. 1984)"]}, {"page": "1974", "response": ["* Physics \u2013 Sir Martin Ryle, Antony Hewish"]}, {"page": "Phased array", "response": ["Adolf Prasch, ed., Die Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Drahtlosen Telegraphie [Progress in the field of wireless telegraphy] (Stuttgart, Germany: Ferdinand Enke, 1906), vol. 4, pages 184\u2013185.

Projected separation between any two telescopes, as seen from the radio source, is called a baseline. For example, the Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico has 27 telescopes with 351 independent baselines at once, which achieves a resolution of 0.2 arc seconds at 3\u00a0cm wavelengths. Martin Ryle's group in Cambridge obtained a Nobel Prize for interferometry and aperture synthesis.Nature vol.158, p. 339, 1946 The Lloyd's mirror interferometer was also developed independently in 1946 by Joseph Pawsey's group at the University of Sydney.Nature vol.157, p.158, 1946 In the early 1950s, the Cambridge Interferometer mapped the radio sky to produce the famous 2C and 3C surveys of radio sources. An example of a large physically connected radio telescope array is the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, located in Pune, India. The largest array, the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), finished in 2012, is located in western Europe and consists of about 81,000 small antennas in 48 stations distributed over an area several hundreds of kilometers in diameter and operates between 1.25 and 30\u00a0m wavelengths. VLBI systems using post-observation processing have been constructed with antennas thousands of miles apart.  Radio interferometers have also been used to obtain detailed images of the anisotropies and the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background, like the CBI interferometer in 2004."]}, {"page": "Sussex", "response": ["In the 20th century, Frederick Soddy won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on radioactive substances, and his investigations into the origin and nature of isotopes.

Martin Ryle shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974 with Cornishman Antony Hewish, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. While working at the University of Sussex, Harold Kroto won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Richard Smalley and Robert Curl from Rice University in the US for the discovery of fullerenes.
