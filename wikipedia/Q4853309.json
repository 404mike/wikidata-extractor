In the spring of 1864 the Maharaja obtained permission to take the body to Bombay in India, where it was cremated, and he erected a small samadh in memory of his mother on the Panchavati side of the Godavari River. Jind Kaur's wishes to be cremated in Lahore had been denied by British authorities.    The memorial in Bombay was maintained by the Kapurthala State Authorities until 1924, when Princess Bamba Sutherland moved her remains and the memorial to the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh in Lahore.
