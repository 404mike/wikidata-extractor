Price, who worked with Harry Weedon), Price was born in Stone, Staffordshire and studied architecture at Cambridge University (St John's College \u2013 graduating in 1955) and the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, where he encountered, and was influenced by, the modernist architect and urban planner Arthur Korn.From 1958 to 1964 he taught part-time at the AA and at the Council of Industrial Design. He later founded Polyark, an architectural schools network.\nAfter graduating, Price worked briefly for Erno Goldfinger, Denys Lasdun, the partnership of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, and applied unsuccessfully for a post at London County Council, working briefly as a professional illustrator before starting his own practice in 1960. He worked with The Earl of Snowdon and Frank Newby on the design of the Snowdon Aviary at London Zoo (1961). He later also worked with Buckminster Fuller on the Claverton Dome.\nOne of his more notable projects was the East London Fun Palace (1961), developed in association with theatrical director Joan Littlewood and cybernetician Gordon Pask. Although it was never built, its flexible space influenced other architects, notably Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano whose Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris extended many of Price's ideas \u2013 some of which Price used on a more modest scale in the Inter-Action Centre at Kentish Town, London (1971).Having conceived the idea of using architecture and education as a way to drive economic redevelopment \u2013 notably in the north Staffordshire Potteries area (the 'Thinkbelt' project) \u2013 he continued to contribute to planning debates. Think-Belt (1963\u201366) envisaged the reuse of an abandoned railway line as a roving \"higher education facility\", re-establishing the Potteries as a centre of science and technology. Mobile classroom, laboratory and residential modules could be moved grouped and assembled as required.In 1969, with planner Sir Peter Hall and the editor of New Society magazine Paul Barker, he published Non-plan, a work challenging planning orthodoxy.\nIn 1984 Price proposed the redevelopment of London's South Bank, and foresaw the London Eye by suggesting that a giant Ferris wheel should be constructed by the River Thames.\nPrice, who was the partner of the actress Eleanor Bron, died in London, aged 68, in 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eleanor Bron", "response": ["Bron was the partner of the architect Cedric Price for many years until his death in 2003; they had no children.

Before this, in Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, he had cut across mentor Pevsner's main theories, linking modernism to built structures in which the 'functionalism' was actually subject to formal structures. Later, he wrote a Guide to Modern Architecture (1962, later titled Age of the Masters, a Personal View of Modern Architecture). Banham predicted a \"second age\" of the machine and mass consumption.

Why not, we wondered, suggest an experiment in getting along without planning and seeing what emerged?\" The project, titled \"Non-Plan: An Experiment in Freedom\", Barker notes, \"was strongly influenced by Banham\u2019s essays in the magazine\".
