Mount Baker was named for Vancouver's third lieutenant, Joseph Baker, although the first European to see it was Manuel Quimper, who named it la gran monta\u00f1a del Carmelo (\"Great Mount Carmel\") in 1790. Mount Rainier was named after Admiral Peter Rainier. Later in 1792, Vancouver had his lieutenant William Robert Broughton explore the lower Columbia River. He named Mount Hood after Lord Samuel Hood, an admiral of the Royal Navy. Mount St. Helens was sighted by Vancouver in May 1792, from near the mouth of the Columbia River. It was named for Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens, a British diplomat. Vancouver's expedition did not, however, name the mountain range which contained these peaks. He referred to it simply as the \"eastern snowy range\". Earlier Spanish explorers called it Sierra Nevada, meaning \"snowy mountains\"."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Spain", "response": ["|Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "Alleyne Fitzherbert, Baron St. Helens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Lord St Helens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Denmark", "response": ["*1801\u20131802: Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens Plenipotentiary"]}, {"page": "Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens "]}, {"page": "Michael Hughes-Young, 1st Baron St Helens", "response": [":::see also Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "List of Old Derbeians", "response": ["*Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens (1753\u20131839), diplomat"]}, {"page": "Lords and Gentlemen of the Bedchamber", "response": ["*1804\u2013?: Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "Alleyne Fitzherbert", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "Alleyne FitzHerbert", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}, {"page": "Derby", "response": ["* Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens (1753\u20131839), diplomat, eponym of Mount St. Helens"]}, {"page": "Alleyne Fitzherbert, Baron St Helens", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens"]}]}}
