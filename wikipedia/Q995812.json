These workers were able to travel Milnrow's completed tramway from 1912, which passed by Dale Street, Milnrow's central thoroughfare lined with banks, butchers, confectioners, chemists and drapers. Ten years after it was first proposed, in 1913, a new Anglican parish church of St Ann was consecrated at Belfield at its boundary with Firgrove so as to serve the swell in population across the Rochdale-Milnrow boundary and ease pressure at Milnrow's Anglican parish church. An outbreak of smallpox occurred in 1914; an investigation by the Royal Society of Medicine to link the infection with imported cotton bales from Brazil, Mexico, Peru or the United States was inconclusive. The \"most disastrous fire on record\" in the Milnrow area resulted in the \"spectacular\" destruction of Newhey's Ellenroad Mill in 1916, at a cost of \u00a3150,000 (\u00a3 in ), but with no loss of life. Tank Week, a national touring campaign to help fund the British heavy tanks of World War I, came to Milnrow resulting in a collective donation of \u00a3180,578 (\u00a3 in ) from the people of the district. Upon conclusion of the war, the National Savings Movement praised the people of Milnrow for their donation, and in May 1919 presented the district with a 23-ton female Mark IV tank for permanent public display in Milnrow. Butterworth Hall Colliery closed in 1928, and poor maintenance forebode the closure of Milnrow's tramway in 1932. In 1934, Milnrow Council agreed that its publicly displayed World War I tank had become \"an eyesore\" and \"a potential source of danger to children\", and consequently sold and removed it for scrap. In the same year, Milnrow Council was gifted land in Firgrove to be used as a public sports pitch. Social housing estates of semi-detached properties with gardens were constructed in both Milnrow and Newhey during the 1930s, while roads in Newhey were laid by German prisoners of war during World War II. Over 500 municipal homes were built between 1930 and 1950, which Chris Davies MP described in Parliament as \"good, solid, middle-of-the-road housing [...] typical examples of some of the best council housing built in Britain\". Cliffe House at Newhey, formerly occupied by the prominent Heap manufacturing family, was demolished and in 1952 its grounds were opened as the recreational and publicly owned Milnrow Memorial Park. Following the Great Depression, the region's textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid-20th century. Milnrow's last standing cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill, demolished in the late 1990s. Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation in the second half of the 20th century, spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area, making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable. The Pennine Drive housing estate was constructed in the mid-1980s. A restoration project to reopen the dilapidated Rochdale Canal resulted in Firgrove Bridge, at Milnrow's boundary with Rochdale, being rebuilt in October 2001; a Bellway-constructed housing estate was built next to the canal between 2005 and 2007. Milnrow tram stop opened as part of Greater Manchester's light-rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013. Although its route through Milnrow was carefully planned to mitigate against bad weather conditions, the local section of the M62 was made impassable by the \"Beast from the East\" cold weather wave in March 2018. Stranded motorists were invited in to homes and offered food and shelter by \"kindhearted\" volunteers in Milnrow and Newhey while the British Army cleared the motorway."]}, {"page": "List of members of the European Parliament (2004\u20132009)", "response": ["|Chris Davies||United Kingdom||North West England||Lib Dem||ALDE"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1979\u20132010)", "response": ["|Chris Davies"]}, {"page": "Cheadle Hulme School", "response": ["* Chris Davies (born 1954), former Liberal Democrat Member of the European ParliamentLiberal Democrats: People "]}, {"page": "Oldham East and Saddleworth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Chris Davies was MP for the former Littleborough and Saddleworth seat since the 1995 by-election."]}, {"page": "North West England (European Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| colspan = 7 | Chris DaviesLiberal Democrat", "|Chris Davies  "]}, {"page": "European Parliament Committee on Fisheries", "response": ["Chris Davies was the chairman (2019 \u2013 2020) - until the United Kingdom left the European Union."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: D", "response": ["*Chris Davies (1995\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Liberal Association", "response": ["*Chris Davies, CULC member, MP for Littleborough and Saddleworth 1995\u20131997, MEP for North West England, 1999-2014 and 2019-; former Leader of the Lib Dem group in the European Parliament"]}, {"page": "2006 Liberal Democrats leadership election", "response": ["Following Kennedy's admission, a letter from twenty-five Liberal Democrat MPs was delivered to him on 6 January.
