She joined the project in November 1990, while an undergraduate maths student enrolled on a sandwich course at Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University). Pellow recalled having little experience with programming languages, \"... apart from using a bit of Pascal and FORTRAN as part of my degree course.\"Almost immediately after Berners-Lee completed the WorldWideWeb web browser for the NeXT platform  Pellow was tasked with creating a browser using her recently acquired skills in the C programming language. The outcome was that she wrote the first generic Line Mode Browser that could run on non-NeXT systems. The WWW team began to improve on her work, creating several experimental versions. Pellow was involved in porting the browser to different types of computers.She left CERN at the end of August 1991 but returned after graduating in 1992 to work with Robert Cailliau on MacWWW, the first web browser for the classic Mac OS.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Web browser", "response": ["The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created in 1990 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

The application of Boole's theory to digital circuit design would come in 1937 by Claude Shannon. Boole's grandson, the physicist G. I. Taylor, made significant experimental contributions to quantum mechanics. The first practical demonstration of radar was near Daventry in 1935. Robert Robinson, of Chesterfield in Derbyshire, invented the circular symbol in 1925 for the pi bonds of the benzene ring, as found on all structural diagrams of aromatic compounds.

In April 1987 he left the PS division to become group leader of Office Computing Systems in the Data Handling division. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a hypertext system for access to the many forms of documentation at and related to CERN. Berners-Lee created the system, calling it World Wide Web, between September and December 1990. During this time, Cailliau and he co-authored a proposal for funding for the project. Cailliau later became a key proponent of the project, running several projects to create and support browsers on different operating systems including various UNIX flavours and Classic Mac OS.

Berners-Lee and his team could not port the WorldWideWeb application with its features\u2014including the graphical WYSIWYG editor\u2014 to the more widely deployed X Window System, since they had no experience in programming it.

The browser could access Usenet newsgroups and FTP files as well. However, it could run only on the NeXT; Nicola Pellow therefore created a simple text browser, called the Line Mode Browser, that could run on almost any computer. To encourage use within CERN, Bernd Pollermann put the CERN telephone directory on the web\u2014previously users had to log onto the mainframe in order to look up phone numbers."]}, {"page": "Sandwich degree", "response": ["Alumni of sandwich courses at other universities include: Nicola Pellow of Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University) who was involved in work on the World Wide Web in the early 1990s; Nigel McGuinness who studied at the University of Leicester and became a professional wrestler; Veronica German, a politician, who studied at the University of Birmingham; Olga FitzRoy, an audio engineer and campaigner who studied at the University of Surrey; Paul Walsh who studied at Manchester Polytechnic and became the chief executive of Diageo; Alex Carta\u00f1\u00e1, a British-Spanish singer-songwriter and actress who studied at the University of Westminster; Russell Deacon who works in governance and policy and studied at the University Glamorgan; Sean Ekins, a pharmacologist who studied at Nottingham Trent Polytechnic, now Nottingham Trent University; Bunmi Olaye who studied at University of East London and founded a luxury fashion brand, Bunmi Koko; Lorraine Gradwell studied a degree in Fashion Design and Management at Middlesbrough Art College and Hollins College in Manchester; Colin Larkin who studied typography and book design at the London College of Printing, now the London College of Communication; several alumni of Aston University; and \u00c9lise Delzenne a French former professional road and track racing cyclist who studied at ENSAIT in France."]}, {"page": "MacWWW", "response": ["It was written at CERN by Robert Cailliau and later Nicola Pellow helped with the development.
