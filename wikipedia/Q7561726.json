Bickham decided to use a series of short stories instead of one long story to \"recreate the feel of the original series,\" \"so hopefully, reading a story from the manga will feel the same as watching an episode of the show.\" Bickham said that writing the stories became entertaining when he \"got into the Domo mindset.\" The writer said that Domo's thoughts do not need to be expressed in words as they are \"always very simple and innocent.\" Bickham added that sometimes other characters speak for him. Bickham said that the Domo: the Manga stories \"are driven by situations instead of dialogue.\" To prepare for writing the series, Bickham watched each episode multiple times; Bickham intended to \"get a feel for the characters so that the jump from stop-motion to manga would be as seamless as possible.\" He added that \"more than anything, I had to have fun doing it.
