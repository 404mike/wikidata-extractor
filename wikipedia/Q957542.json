First, the natives refused to sell grain at the usual market price, and then refused to sell it at \"a reasonable price\". Pynchon refused to buy it, attempting to teach the natives a peaceful lesson about integrity and reliability. Windsor's cattle were starving, however, and the citizens of Hartford were furious. With Windsor's consent, Hartford commissioned the famous Indian fighter John Mason to travel to Springfield with \"money in one hand and a sword in the other\" to threaten the natives, and thereby force the grain trade. The natives capitulated and ultimately sold their grain. After \"negotiating the trade\", Mason refused to share the grain with Springfield, and, to add further insult, insisted that Springfield pay a tax when sailing ships passed Windsor. Outraged, Springfield forever sided with the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a faraway theocracy based in Boston, rather than with the Connecticut Colony, which was much closer geographically and far more compatible ideologically. Windsor played a neutral role in the colonial rivalry between Hartford and Springfield; however, Windsor's direct border with both settlements caused many discussions about whether to align with Massachusetts or Connecticut.

With his authority originating directly from the gods, as opposed to the Crown, Oneco argued that the sachemate was a legal equal to the English monarchy. According to Oneco, his ancestors had been given a sacred pipe by the gods as a symbol of their authority and, as a testament to their friendship towards the English, now stored it in the same location as they kept a ceremonial sword given to them by Charles II of England. Oneco's argument was novel for describing a peer-to-peer relationship with the Crown and invoking the receipt of a diplomatic gift as proof of it.
