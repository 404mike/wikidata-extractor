AllMusic noted that \"Cameron was one of a quartet of key figures in England's postwar folk song revival - and to give a measure of her importance, the other three were Ewan MacColl, A. L. Lloyd, and Alan Lomax\". She was a respected and popular folk music performer through the 1950s and early 60s as well as appearing in several films; she focused almost exclusively on her acting career from 1966 onwards. Cameron provided the singing voice for actress Julie Christie's part in the hit 1967 film version of Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd, but changed career direction and became a film researcher in the early 1970s before her early death in a domestic accident in 1980. One of the traditional songs in her repertoire, \"Blackwaterside\", recorded by Cameron in 1962, was subsequently popularised by notable \"next generation\" U.K. folk music performers Anne Briggs, Bert Jansch and Sandy Denny.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ewan MacColl", "response": ["Collaboration\u00a0\u2013 Bob and Ron Copper, Ewan MacColl, Isla Cameron, Seamus Ennis and Peter Kennedy"]}, {"page": "Theatre Workshop", "response": ["* Isla Cameron"]}, {"page": "Transatlantic Records", "response": ["Some of their early records included artists as diverse as The Dubliners, actress Sheila Hancock, jazz singer Annie Ross, actresses Jean Hart and Isla Cameron, and Shakespearean actor Tony Britton.

As often happened, these were issued first on the Transatlantic label in the UK and then on the subsidiary label XTRA. The catalogue numbers often contained \"TRA\" within the prefix, thus MTRA, XTRA, and LTRA were all used. The latter prefix was used with a series of LPs produced by Bill Leader (who worked with Nat Joseph from the outset as an engineer). Amongst these \"Leader\" records were recordings by Nic Jones, Martin Simpson, Mick Ryan, Bandoggs (another Nic Jones group), Andrew Cronshaw, and Al O'Donnell.

Like many of the Scottish Travellers from Aberdeen, Glasgow and Ayrshire, she went to Blairgowrie to pick raspberries once a year. Hamish Henderson was born in Blairgowrie and tried to track down the best singers there. In 1953, he followed her reputation to her doorstep in Aberdeen. According to legend Jeannie was reluctant to let him in. She challenged him to tell her the opening line of Child ballad no 163, \"The Battle of Harlaw\", and he complied. In November of the same year she was staying in the London apartment of Alan Lomax. In preparation for a TV appearance, Jean Ritchie, Margaret Barry and Isla Cameron were also there. They swapped songs with each other, while the tape rolled. It is sometimes stated that she made the first recording of \"The Battle of Harlaw\" but this is not so. The first recording was made in 1936 by the Bothy Ballad singer Willie Kemp (for the Beltona label) and it may be from this that she learnt the song. Another of the songs she sang was \"Andrew Lammie\" (\"Mill o' Tifty's Annie\"), lasting over 13 minutes. At the end she told Alan Lomax about the parts of the story that she had not sung. Many of the 1953 recordings were issued as The Queen Among the Heather in 1975.

The younger singer Anne Briggs has also been stated to have obtained the song via Lloyd, p. 4 although in the case of Briggs' own, 1971 recorded version (with notes by Lloyd) her version is merely stated to be \"the one popularised from a BBC Archive recording of an Irish traveller, Mary Doran\" and from opinions expressed elsewhere it seems most likely that she learned it from Cameron's recording or public performancesThe Mudcat Cafe: Origins: Blackwaterside (in the same discussion it is suggested that the version from Winnie Ryan of Belfast, not Mary Doran, was the likely source of the variant as subsequently popularised in the revival, and that Lloyd made an error in his liner note). Briggs in turn taught it to singer/guitarist Bert Jansch. Early in 1965, Briggs and Jansch were performing regularly together in folk clubsHarper p. 162 and spent most of the daytime at a friend's flat, collaborating on new songs and the development of complex guitar accompaniments for traditional songs.Harper p.161 Briggs has noted that \"Everybody up to that point was accompanying traditional songs in a very... three-chord way.... It was why I always sang unaccompanied... but seeing Bert's freedom from chords, I suddenly realisedthis chord stuff, you don't need it\".Harper p. 161. Part of an interview with Anne Briggs. \"Blackwaterside\" was one of the first songs that they worked on. Briggs belatedly recorded the song on her eponymous 1971 album (by which time she was playing a guitar accompaniment), though Jansch had recorded it (as \"Blackwaterside\") in 1966 on his album Jack Orion.Mick Wall (2008), When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography Of Led Zeppelin',' London: Orion, p. 56 It is not known when Jansch started singing the song in the folk clubs, but certainly before the recording of Jack Orion.
