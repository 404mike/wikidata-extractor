Eustace Chesser, in Shelley and Zastrozzi (1965), analysed the novella as a complex psychological thriller: \"When I first came across Zastrozzi I was immediately struck by its resemblance to the dream material with which every psychoanalyst is familiar. It was not a story told with the detachment of a professional writer for the entertainment of the public. Whatever the conscious intention of the young Shelley, he was in fact, writing for himself. He was opening the floodgates of the unconscious and allowing its fantasies to pour out unrestrainedly. He was betraying, unwittingly, the emotional problems that agitated his adolescent mind.\"Chesser, Eustace. Shelley and Zastrozzi: Self-Revelation of a Neurotic. London: Gregg/Archive, 1965. Eustace Chesser: \"The story itself had the incoherence of a dream because that is just what it was \u2013 a day dream in which our conscious conflicts were worked out in disguise.\"", "# Chesser, Eustace.
