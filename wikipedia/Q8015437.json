In 1867, he began as a professional with the Nottingham Commercial Club at Trent Bridge and also started playing for the All England Eleven.  A match for All England against the United England Eleven in 1869 marked his first-class debut. Also in 1869 he started playing for Nottinghamshire and achieved his career highest score of 99 in his second match of the season against Kent. In 1870 he took 3 five-wicket innings and took ten wickets in one match. Also in 1870 he took up a post with Bolton Cricket Club. His form for Nottinghamshire dropped in the 1871 season and in 1872, with residency established, he started playing for Lancashire. In the first six  seasons he took 40 five wicket innings and had 12 ten-wicket matches. He was a nemesis to newly formed  Derbyshire, who gave him 14 five wicket innings, and he achieved his best performance of 8 for 31 against Derbyshire in 1877. He left the Bolton Club at the end of the 1877 season and a benefit match was held for him on 14 September between A.N.Hornby's XI and  Sixteen of Bolton.  His next position was with Castleton Club at Rochdale. His form declined in 1878 and 1879 and he played his last season for Lancashire in 1880.\nMcIntyre was a right-arm fast bowler and took 510 first-class wickets at an average of 12.61 and a best performance of 8 for 31.

Moreover, Watson was an exceptionally accurate bowler and his short stature and consequent low trajectory meant he was impossible for contemporary batsmen to jump out to and hit.

Grace's cricket career (1864 to 1870)", "response": ["Grace made a handful of appearances for the USEE including a 10 wicket victory over Southgate followed a week later by a 57 run defeat in Worcester by a Worcestershire County XXII. In the latter match, Grace was bowled cheaply in each innings by the Nottinghamshire professional fast bowler William McIntyre, who was playing as a given man for Worcestershire. As he did not yet have a first-class county to play for and did not join MCC until the following year, Grace's opportunities to play in major matches were few but, throughout his career, he was always keen to \"fill in the gaps\" by playing in minor matches. He was invariably a formidable opponent in these and in one game for Clifton against a Civil Service team, he hammered the bowling for 210."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Blackburn (cricketer)", "response": ["Blackburn made two first-class appearances for Nottinghamshire in 1879, against Lancashire at Old Trafford, and Kent at Trent Bridge.
