He made over 300 appearances in the Football League in an eleven years professional career.\nStarting his career with non-league Moor Green, he was signed by Port Vale in 1994. After six years at Vale Park he moved on to Rotherham United, where he spent four years. He played over 100 league games for each club. He then played over fifty games for Brentford before leaving the English Football League in 2005 to join Boston United. He spent four years at Boston before finishing his career at Kidsgrove Athletic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Martin Allen", "response": ["Allen took over from Wally Downes at Second Division side Brentford in March 2004. He had a good run at the club, saving them from relegation to the Third Division in what remained of the 2003\u201304 season. In the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons he took Brentford to the play-offs with fourth and third-place finishes respectively, but they were eliminated by Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City respectively in the semi-finals on both occasions. Allen won press attention during the 2004\u201305 season for the success of his self-described \"two bob team\", which was composed of ageing pros (John Salako, Andy Myers, Scott Fitzgerald and Jamie Lawrence), free transfers (Deon Burton, Chris Hargreaves, Stewart Talbot and Isaiah Rankin) and young guns who would go on to play in the Premier League (Jay Tabb, Stephen Hunt, Sam Sodje and Michael Turner). Allen took Brentford to the fifth round of the FA Cup in two consecutive years, going out to Premier League sides Southampton in the 2004\u201305 season (losing 3\u20131 in a replay, after a 2\u20132 draw at St Mary's) and Charlton Athletic 3\u20131 in the 2005\u201306 season. He also was in charge of one of the major giant killings in the fourth round in the 2005\u201306 season, beating Premier League side Sunderland 2\u20131."]}, {"page": "Marston Green", "response": ["Stewart Talbot, professional Footballer who has played for Port Vale and Brentford amongst others."]}, {"page": "Paul Robinson (footballer, born December 1978)", "response": ["In a match against Port Vale on 29 April 1999, Robinson made a poor tackle on Vale player Stewart Talbot, breaking both bones in Talbot's lower leg. The injury kept Talbot out of the game for 10 months and resulted in a \"six-figure\" out-of-court settlement. Out of 252 Watford appearances he was booked 63 times and sent off three times. One of these sendings off came in the 1998\u201399 play-off semi-final against Birmingham City, which saw him miss the second leg. He did feature, however, in the club's 2\u20130 play-off victory against future employers Bolton Wanderers."]}, {"page": "Michael Dobson (footballer)", "response": ["Dobson began the 2004\u201305 season as the Bees' regular starting right back, but a torn cartilage suffered in September 2004 saw him lose his place to stand-in right back Kevin O'Connor and the captaincy to midfielder Stewart Talbot. He won back his place upon his return in January 2005, but began to drift out of the starting lineup in February and a broken arm suffered in a match versus Stockport County on 2 April ended his season. He made 23 appearances and scored one goal during 2004\u201305. Dobson appeared sparingly as a midfielder during the early months of the 2005\u201306 season and later admitted in 2019 that he and manager Martin Allen \"didn't see eye-to-eye\". He departed on loan for the remainder of the campaign on 24 November 2005, a move which generated funds to extend the loan of Darren Pratley, who had usurped Dobson in the midfield pecking order. Dobson was released in May 2006 and finished his Brentford career on 211 appearances and seven goals."]}, {"page": "Jeff Minton", "response": ["He joined Port Vale on a free transfer in June 1999, in a move that reunited him with Brian Horton. He scored four goals in 26 games in 1999\u20132000, as the \"Valiants\" were relegated out of the First Division. Following a 2\u20131 defeat to non-league Canvey Island at Vale Park in the FA Cup, he and four other players were placed on the transfer list in December 2000; this was despite him scoring twice in the original 4\u20134 draw at Park Lane. He scored four goals in 29 games in 2000\u201301. He struggled to hold down a place in the first team in the New Year and entered talks with Rotherham United in March 2001. He was signed to provide cover for the suspended Stewart Talbot. Minton scored twice on his debut for the \"Millers\" in a 3\u20130 win over Bristol City at Millmoor.

A run of four consecutive victories in December showed the squad's potential however. Tony Naylor put a hat-trick past Charlton Athletic in a 3\u20131 win at The Valley on 14 December.

Vale's form tailed off, and on 19 January they managed to go from 4\u20130 up against Queens Park Rangers at half-time to finish the game drawn 4\u20134. In February, Rudge spent \u00a375,000 to bring Dutch midfielder Rogier Koordes in from Telstar. However he had to suffer the departure of winger Steve Guppy, who was sold to top-flight Leicester City for \u00a3850,000.
