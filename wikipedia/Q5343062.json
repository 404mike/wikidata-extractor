While the motion was not expected to pass, the margin of its defeat (243 to 362) was much wider than expected. Later in the same Parliament, the Criminal Justice Bill provided an opportunity on 11 May 1982 for several new clauses to be proposed which would have reinstated capital punishment. The first, which simply declared that \"A person convicted of murder shall be liable to capital punishment\", was tabled by Edward Gardner, and rejected by 195 to 357. It was followed by an alternative under which capital punishment would be available \"as the penalty for an act of terrorism involving the loss of human life\"; this new clause was rejected by 176 to 332. A further new clause proposing capital punishment \"as the penalty for murder by means of firearms or explosives\" was rejected by 176 to 343. Then a new clause allowing for capital punishment \"as the penalty for murder of a police or prison officer\" was rejected by 208 to 332. Finally a new clause allowing capital punishment \"as the penalty for murder in the course of robbery and burglary which involves the use of offensive weapons\" was rejected by 151 to 331.", "The new Parliament in 1983 again prompted supporters of capital punishment to put their case. Sir Edward Gardner's motion \"That this House favours the restoration of the death penalty for murder\" was debated on 13 July 1983, with several amendments moved to restrict capital punishment to certain categories of murder. The amendments were voted on first: capital punishment for murder \"resulting from acts of terrorism\" was rejected by 245 to 361, for murder \"of a police officer during the course of his duties\" by 263 to 344, for murder \"of a prison officer during the course of his duties\" by 252 to 348, for murder \"by shooting or causing an explosion\" by 204 to 374, and for murder \"in the course or furtherance of theft\" by 194 to 369. The main motion was then defeated by 223 to 368. Towards the end of the Parliament, a new clause proposed to the Criminal Justice Bill proposed to return the death penalty for \"A person convicted by the unanimous verdict of a jury of the premeditated killing of another person or of knowingly and intentionally killing another person in a manner, or for a reason, or in circumstances which a reasonable person would consider to be evil\" was rejected by 230 to 342 on 1 April 1987."]}, {"page": "1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*Edward Gardner (Billericay)"]}, {"page": "Human rights in the United Kingdom", "response": ["In 1976, a draft Bill of Rights was moved in the House of Lords by Lord Wade and in 1978 a House of Lords Select committee published a report recommending incorporation which was debated in the Lords leading to an amendment being moved which was requesting that the government introduce legislation on the matter. Lord Wade succeeded in securing the Lords' approval for a draft bill but it did not make any progress in the Commons where Alan Beith's unsuccessful attempt to secure a second reading was poorly attended. There was concern at the time about judges deciding cases involving human rights which could lead them from their traditionally impartial role to political issues  In 1986 Lord Broxbourne secured the Lords' approval for his incorporation bill, but was unsuccessful in the Commons, even though a second reading had been obtained. Edward Gardner's 1989 bill to incorporate the Convention also failed on its second reading. At the time, official Conservative party policy was in favour of maintaining the existing constitutional arrangements which it saw as ensuring a high standard of protection of individual rights."]}, {"page": "Fylde (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir Edward Gardner"]}, {"page": "Billericay (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Edward Gardner"]}, {"page": "Freckleton", "response": ["Freckleton Library was opened in 1980 by Sir Edward Gardner, MP for Fylde South.
