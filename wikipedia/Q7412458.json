It is said that in several of Joshua Reynolds' pictures, the trees or foliage were the work of Gardner. Reynolds' late style clearly influenced Gardner's work in terms of composition, handling, and conception of figures. However, if it comes to figure work Gardner was never such an accurate draughtsman like Reynolds was. It is quite easy to believe that Gardner was responsible in many instances for the landscape backgrounds, for the trees, for the tree trunks and for the wreaths of flowers in Reynolds\u2019 paintings. But it is not at all likely that Daniel Gardner was responsible for any of the figure work in the paintings of Joshua Reynolds.Neil Jeffares: Dictionary of pastellists before 1800 \u2013 Gardner, Daniel. 2012.Samuel Redgrave: A Dictionary of Artists of the English School: Painters, Sculptors, Architects, Engravers and Ornamentists: With notices of their lives and work.

As a portraitist, he is known for being extensively patronized by Queen Anne, both before and after her accession in 1702. Anne, who apparently preferred Lilly's style to these of his more notable contemporaries Godfrey Kneller and Michael Dahl, commissioned full-length state portraits of herself and her family from him, reproduced for leading members of the nobility; the c. 1698 portrait in the Windsor Castle of the Queen's short-lived son, the Duke of Gloucester, is a signed example of these. The Queen sat for Lilly at least twice after her accession, with the full-length portrait in the Blenheim Palace, published as a mezzotint made by John Simon, being particularly notable; whereas the 19th-century author Samuel Redgrave denoted it as an \"indifferent work, weak in drawing and expression, cold and grey in colour,\" the Dictionary of Art co-author Richard Jeffree defined it as the \"most grandiose\" of Anne's state portraits, showing the influence of John Closterman.; ; ; ."]}]}}
