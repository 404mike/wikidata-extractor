Shearer was born in Northamptonshire in August 1917. A Lieutenant in the 4th Seaforth Highlanders, he was the only British officer to join the Corps, with the exception of the brief involvement of Douglas Berneville-Claye. This was the result of his having suffered a serious nervous breakdown in March 1943. He  had become suicidal in the wake of this. He rarely left his room and would not put on his BFC uniform. After a few weeks he was returned to the Ansbach mental asylum and eventually repatriated to Britain by the Red Cross in January 1945.Weale, Adrian (2014-11-12).
