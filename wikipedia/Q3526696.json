Harry Altham wrote of him in A History of Cricket, \"Maurice Read had been recognised as a dashing player up to Test Match form, to say nothing of being a wonderful fielder in the country.\" A hard-hitting and, according to Lord Hawke, \"magnificent batsman who never had pretensions to be even a moderate change bowler\", Read did little bowling except in 1883, when he claimed 27 first-class wickets including his career best of 6\u201341 against Kent.\nBorn in 1859 in Thames Ditton, Surrey, Read joined the Thames Ditton Cricket Club in 1879, made his first-class debut for Surrey in 1880, and played regularly for his county for fifteen years. His most productive year was 1886, when he scored 1,364 runs at an average of 34.97, including two centuries and seven fifties. He was also extremely productive in the first half of 1889, and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1890, but his season was affected later in the year by a bad finger injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W.

The death of Southerton and retirement of other veterans paved the way for new talent in Maurice Read, William Roller, left-arm spinner Edward Barratt and pace bowler Charles Horner to lay a foundation for long-term success in the middle 1880s.

Clapp is recorded as \"absent hurt\" in both of Somerset's innings. In the second innings, Somerset were much improved, reaching 251, their highest batting total of the season. Radcliffe scored the county's only century of the season, scoring 101, and he shared a partnership of 129 with Hewett for the fourth wicket. Hewett reached his own highest score of the season, totalling 85. Nevertheless, Somerset's loss was even heavier than that suffered a week earlier, losing by an innings and 301 runs.
