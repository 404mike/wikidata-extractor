C. McNeile) supposedly based the character of Bulldog Drummond. After Sapper's death in 1937, Fairlie continued the Bulldog Drummond book series.\nFairlie was born in Kensington, London, educated at Downside School, Somerset and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned in December 1918 in the Scots Guards. He was both an Army boxing champion and a member of the Great Britain team in the bobsleigh at the 1924 Winter Olympics at Chamonix, France; his team finished fifth.\nHe married Joan Roskell in 1923 and became a journalist and screenwriter. He again served as an army officer in the Second World War. In addition to the Drummond series Fairlie wrote series books about Victor Caryll, Johnny Macall and Mr Malcolm. He died in East Lavington in West Sussex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rock paper scissors", "response": ["A reader then wrote in to say that the game \"zhot\" referred to was evidently Jan-ken-pon, which she had often seen played throughout Japan.: Letter to the editor, from Miss F.C.Pringle Although at this date the game appears to have been new enough to British readers to need explaining, the appearance by 1927 of a popular thriller with the title Scissors Cut Paper,Gerard Fairlie, Scissors Cuts Paper, Hodder and Stoughton, (1927) followed by Stone Blunts Scissors (1929), suggests it quickly became popular."]}, {"page": "George Cayley", "response": ["* Gerard Fairlie and Elizabeth Cayley, The Life of a Genius, Hodder and Stoughton, 1965."]}, {"page": "Bobsleigh at the 1924 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| 5 ||align=left|  ||align=left| William Horton, Archibald Crabbe, Gerard Fairlie, and George Pim"]}, {"page": "Bulldog Drummond", "response": ["Hugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond is a fictional character, created by H.

Drummond is a First World War veteran who, fed up with his sedate lifestyle, advertises looking for excitement, and becomes a gentleman adventurer.  The character has appeared in novels, short stories, on the stage, in films, on radio and television, and in graphic novels.", "After an unsuccessful one-off appearance as a policeman in The Strand Magazine, the character was reworked by McNeile into a gentleman adventurer for his 1920 novel Bulldog Drummond. McNeile went on to write 10 Drummond novels, four short stories, four stage plays, and a screenplay before his death in 1937. The stories were continued by his friend Gerard Fairlie between 1938 and 1954.", "Captain Hugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond, DSO, MC is a member of \"the Breed\", a class of Englishman who were patriotic, loyal and \"physically and morally intrepid\". Drummond is a wealthy gentleman, formerly an officer in the fictional \"Royal Loamshire Regiment\", who, after the First World War, spends his new-found leisure time looking for adventure. McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel Bull-dog Drummond, which was a thriller. The character was an amalgam of McNeile's friend Gerard Fairlie, and his idea of an English gentleman, although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie's claim to be a model for the character, noting that \"he was still at school when Sapper created his\u00a0... hero\".

In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, on his friend Gerard Fairlie and on English gentlemen generally. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and a screenplay.", "McNeile had a quiet life after the war; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that \"as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie, it is the hero who lives the exciting life\". Although he was an \"unremittingly hearty man\", he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and \"liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship\"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as \"not everybody's cup of tea\", and commented that \"he was loud in every possible way\u2014in his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life\". McNeile and his wife had two sons.", "In 1920 McNeile published Bull-Dog Drummond, whose eponymous hero\u2014a member of \"the Breed\"\u2014became his most famous creation. He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel, which was a thriller. Captain Hugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond DSO, MC was described in the novel's sub-title as \"a demobilised officer who found peace dull\" after service during the First World War with the fictional Loamshire Regiment. Drummond went on to appear in ten full-length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend Gerard Fairlie. The character was an amalgam of Fairlie, himself, and his idea of an English gentleman. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Drummond was characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an \"apparently brainless hunk of a man\", who was also a gentleman with a private income; he could also be construed as \"a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact  the war\". The character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an \"unspeakable public school bully\". Drummond's main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson, a master criminal with no national allegiance, who is often accompanied by his wife, Irma. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as \"the slinky epitome of a twenties 'vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, \"a true femme fatale\". After Carl Peterson's death in The Final Count, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife\u2014whom he had met in Bull-Dog Drummond\u2014with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1924 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|William HortonArchibald CrabbeGerard FairlieGeorge Pim"]}, {"page": "Fairlie (surname)", "response": ["*Gerard Fairlie (1899\u20131983), Scottish author and scriptwriter"]}, {"page": "List of works by H.
