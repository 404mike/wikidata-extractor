The Society commissioned him again in 1971 for The Destruction of the Jews, by Josephus,  and in 1974 for Moby Dick, by Melville.  Similarly the short-lived Imprint Society in Barre, Massachusetts, commissioned Palmer to illustrate  H. M. Tomlinson's The Sea and The Jungle in 1971 and Benito Cereno, by Melville, in 1972.  The motif of the head of Babo on a pole returned, reflecting changes in Palmer's artistic style.
