He proved to be an excellent linguist and took up a professorship at Fort William College in Calcutta, India. In 1807 he resigned his professorship for the position of Resident at the Indian city of Lucknow which he held until 1815. In that year was commissioned a Lieutenant-Colonel of the 4th Native Infantry. He returned to the United Kingdom in 1816 and as well as managing the family estates in Inverness-shire he became Member of Parliament and a director of the East India Company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: B", "response": ["*John Baillie"]}, {"page": "Inverness Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Baillie", "| John Baillie"]}, {"page": "Fort William College", "response": ["Teaching of Asian languages dominated: Arabic, Urdu, Persian, Sanskrit, Bengali. Later, Marathi and even Chinese were added. Each department of the college was staffed by notable scholars. The Persian department was headed by Neil B. Edmonstone, Persian translator to the East India Company's government since 1794. His assistant teacher was John H. Harington, a judge of Sadar Diwani Adalat and Francis Gladwin, a soldier diplomat. For Arabic studies, there was Lt. John Baillie, a noted Arabist. The Urdu department was entrusted to John Borthwick Gilchrist, an Indologist of great repute. Henry Thomas Colebrooke, the famous orientalist, was head of the Sanskrit department. William Carey, a non-civilian missionary and a specialist in many Indian languages, was selected to head the department of vernacular languages. While notable scholars were identified and appointed for different languages, there was no suitable person in Calcutta who could be appointed to teach Bengali. In those days, the Brahmin scholars learnt only Sanskrit, considered to be the language of the gods, and they did not study Bengali. The authorities decided to appoint Carey, who was with the Baptist Mission in Serampore. He, in turn, appointed Mrityunjoy Vidyalankar as head pandit, Ramnath Bachaspati as second pandit and Ramram Basu as one of the assistant pandits.Mukhopadhyay, Prabhatkumar, Rammohun O Tatkalin Samaj O Sahitya, 1965, pp. 47\u201351, Viswa Bharati Granthan Bibhag ."]}, {"page": "Hedon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|John Baillie||rowspan=\"2\"| Tory"]}, {"page": "John Baillie", "response": ["John Baillie may refer to:", "* John Baillie (fl. 1747), author of An Essay on the Sublime", "* John Baillie (divine) (1741\u20131806), English divine, became a minister in 1767", "* John Baillie of Leys (1772\u20131833), officer in the British East India Company, professor and politician", "* John Baillie (railway engineer) (1806\u20131859), born in Newcastle upon Tyne, but worked in Austria and Germany", "* John Baillie (theologian) (1886\u20131960), Scottish theologian and Church of Scotland minister", "*John Baillie McIntosh (1829\u20131888), unionist in the American Civil War"]}, {"page": "Jami' al-tawarikh", "response": ["In the 15th century, the Arabic copy was in Herat, perhaps claimed after a victory by the Timurid dynasty. It then passed to the court of the Mughal Empire in India, where it was in the possession of the emperor Akbar (r. 1556\u20131605). There is then a record of it passing through the hands of later Mughal emperors for the next few centuries. It was probably divided into two parts in the mid-1700s, though both sections remained in India until the 19th century, when they were acquired by the British. The portion now in the Edinburgh library was presented as a gift to Ali-I Ahmad Araf Sahib on October 8, 1761, and in 1800 was in the library of the Indian prince Farzada Kuli. This fragment was acquired by Colonel John Baillie of Leys of the East India Company, and then in 1876 passed to the Edinburgh University Library. The other portion was acquired by John Staples Harriott of the East India Company sometime prior to 1813. At some point during the next two decades it was brought to England, probably when Harriott came home on furlough, when the manuscript entered the collection of Major General Thomas Gordon. He then bequeathed it to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1841. In 1948, it was loaned to the British Museum and Library, and in 1980 was auctioned at Sotheby's, where it was purchased by the Rashidiyyah Foundation in Geneva for \u00a3850,000, the highest price ever paid for a medieval manuscript.Blair. p. 36 The Khalili Collection acquired it in 1990.", "The Edinburgh part has a page size of 41.5 \u00d7 34.2\u00a0cm, with a written area of 37 \u00d7 25\u00a0cm, and contains 35 lines per page written in Naskhi calligraphy.  There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the Ghaznavids, Seljuks and Atabeys, and the history of the sultans of Khwarezm. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by Duncan Forbes, who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as \"Baillie's collection\"."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| John Baillie||05/06/1817||1772 \u2013 20 April 1833"]}, {"page": "John Baillie (professor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Baillie of Leys"]}, {"page": "John Baillie (linguist)", "response": ["#redirect John Baillie of Leys"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|John Baillie"]}, {"page": "John Baillie (colonel)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Baillie of Leys"]}, {"page": "John Baillie (MP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Baillie of Leys"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Inverness Burghs||John Baillie||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan = \"2\"|Hedon (two members)||John Baillie||Tory"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1817", "response": ["# John Baillie (1772\u20131833)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Hedon(two members)||John Baillie||Tory"]}]}}
