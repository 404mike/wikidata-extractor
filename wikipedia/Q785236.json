However, this claim came at a time when thousands of jobs were being cut across the country as a number of NHS trusts attempted to cope with budget deficits. This comment did not go down well, and at the Royal College of Nursing 2006 Congress in Bournemouth, Hewitt was heckled and booed by health workers. Delegates at the conference called for job cuts and bed closures, part of planned NHS reforms aimed at improving the effectiveness of the service, to be halted, predicting that the number of posts lost could reach 13,000, and said a work to rule was possible.NHS Cash Crisis The Guardian, 24 April 2006.

In 2018 NHS England and Nursing Standard identified her as one of the 70 most influential UK nurses and midwives of the past 70 years, as part of the NHS 70th birthday celebrations. Nursing and healthcare development in the UK continued to be an important strand of her work, alongside her global health leadership. She joined the secretariat of the Prime Minister\u2019s Commission on the Future of Nursing and Midwifery in England, 2009-2010, launched by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and chaired by Ann Keen MP. She also co-led the secretariat of the Willis Commission on Nursing Education, chaired by Lord Willis of Knaresborough. Its 2012 report, Quality with Compassion: the future of nursing education, found the case for moving to an all-graduate nursing profession not simply desirable, but essential. As policy advisor to the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Global Health, she worked closely with its chair Nigel Crisp on an influential review of global nursing, Triple Impact, which urged policy-makers worldwide to see nursing in a different light, and offered positive solutions and development opportunities. It provided a springboard for the global Nursing Now campaign, 2018-2021, and the declaration of 2020 as the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife. Salvage was active in shaping the campaign and wrote and spoke about it worldwide. Her talk at the University of Edinburgh inspired nurses to celebrate nursing by designing a new tartan incorporating the colours of Scotland\u2019s national nurse uniform. From 2016-2021 she was director of the International Council of Nurses' Global Nursing Leadership Institute, an annual programme helping nurse leaders from round the world to improve their policy and political competencies. This contributed to her election as a Fellow of the Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 2019. In 2021 she was director of a pilot Midwifery Leadership Programme commissioned by the Government of India to take forward its Midwifery Initiative, implemented by the WHO Country Office for India. She has been a trustee and adviser to many governmental and charitable organizations including the Global Initiative on Psychiatry, Medact, the Queen\u2019s Nursing Institute, and Fitzjohn's Food Bank, Lewes, East Sussex."]}]}}
