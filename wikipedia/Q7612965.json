The match was ill-disciplined with nine players being booked.  David Flitcroft had a goal disallowed for offside and the match ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The second leg took place at Vetch Field in Swansea three days later.  In the eighth minute, Swansea's defender Steve Jones broke his right leg and was taken away in an ambulance, shortly before Chester's Chris Priest was dismissed for two yellow cards.  Swansea scored twice in first-half stoppage time, with goals from Dave Thomas and Steve Torpey.  Carl Heggs extended Swansea's lead when he scored with a left-footed volley in the 62nd minute, and the match ended 3\u20130, with the Welsh team progressing to the final with the same aggregate score."]}, {"page": "Steve Jones (footballer born December 1970)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steve Jones (footballer, born December 1970)"]}]}}
