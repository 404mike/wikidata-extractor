Later he said he realised then that he \"was the one who was angry and the people [he] met were more like the Slightly Cross Brigade\". The other members of the group from North-East London, the \"Stoke Newington Eight\", were prosecuted for carrying out bombings as the Angry Brigade in one of the longest criminal trials of English history (it lasted from 30 May to 6 December 1972). As a result of the trial, John Barker, Jim Greenfield, Hilary Creek and Anna Mendelssohn received prison sentences of 10 years. A number of other defendants were found not guilty, including Stuart Christie, who had previously been imprisoned in Spain for carrying explosives with the intent to assassinate the caudillo Francisco Franco, and Angela Mason who became a director of the LGBT rights group Stonewall and was awarded an OBE for services to homosexual rights."]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1940\u20131999||data-sort-value=\"Mason, Angela\"|Angela Mason||United Kingdom||1944||\u2013||Second-wave feminist||"]}, {"page": "Stonewall (charity)", "response": ["* Angela Mason (1992\u20132002)", "Under Angela Mason, it became the most influential LGBT lobbying organisation in Britain.
