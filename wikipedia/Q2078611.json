Perhaps his best remembered contribution is the editing of the 1957 film The Bridge on the River Kwai.\nIn his obituary for Taylor, Tony Sloman gives several examples to illustrate Taylor's editing. He writes:By 1963 the British New Wave had beached, and Peter Taylor edited the superb This Sporting Life, the debut feature of the cine-literate director Lindsay Anderson. It is a remarkable study of working-class angst, with a cutting style like no other British feature before it, an ever-underrated achievement by Taylor, as Anderson received all the credit, as directors do. This Sporting Life remains, with The Bridge on the River Kwai, the supreme testament to Peter Taylor's craft and talent.\nTaylor won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), which was placed as the 36th best American film ever made in the 2007 American Film Institute listing. David Lean directed the film, about whom Ken Dancyger has noted that, \"Lean may have made few films, but his influence has far exceeded those numbers. The role of editing in his films may help explain that influence.\" Lean himself had begun his own career as a film editor. Sloman comments on the relationship of Lean, Taylor, and the film's editing: ...film industry wags may assert that the editing Oscar came with the letter of engagement on a David Lean film - and in later years it is certainly true that Lean, a former editor, would himself dictate the precise nature of the cutting - none the less, Peter Taylor had served a long apprenticeship with Lean. His Oscar for Kwai was an honest vindication of his talent, for Taylor physically edited the film into shape, working closely with Lean only on the final cut.\nTaylor moved to Rome, Italy around 1966. He edited three films with Italian director Franco Zeffirelli; both La Traviata (1983) and Otello (1986) were nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Film.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "response": ["| Peter Taylor"]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Film Editing", "response": ["| Peter Taylor"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 17 || Peter Taylor || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 75 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Italy || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Editor, Assistant Editor || "]}, {"page": "Peter Taylor", "response": ["Peter Taylor may refer to:", "* Peter Taylor (writer) (1917\u20131994), American author, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction", "* Peter Taylor (composer), British composer of television and film soundtrack music", "* Peter Taylor (film editor) (1922\u20131997), English film editor, winner of an Academy Award for Film Editing", "* Peter Taylor (paymaster) (1714\u20131777), British politician, MP for Wells and MP for Portsmouth", "* Peter Taylor, Baron Taylor of Gosforth (1930\u20131997), Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, 1992\u20131997", "* Peter Taylor alias Perce, Member of Parliament (MP) for Marlborough in 1554", "* Peter Taylor (British politician), Mayor of Watford", "* Peter Taylor (Australian footballer) (born 1954), Australian rules footballer", "* Peter Taylor (Australian cricketer) (born 1956), Australian cricketer", "* Peter Taylor (English cricketer) (born 1942), former cricketer for Bedfordshire", "* Peter Taylor (South African cricketer) (born 1934), South African cricketer", "* Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20131990), English football goalkeeper and manager, associated with Brian Clough", "* Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1953) (born 1953), English football manager and former player", "* Peter Taylor (rower) (born 1984), New Zealand Olympic rower", "* Peter Taylor (botanist) (1926\u20132011), British botanist at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew", "* Peter Taylor (journalist) (born 1942), British journalist and author of non-fiction books, especially about Northern Ireland and Al-Qaeda", "* Peter Taylor (environmentalist) (born 1948), British environmentalist", "* Peter Taylor (priest) (born 1944), Archdeacon of Harlow", "* Peter Taylor (General Hospital), a character from the soap opera General Hospital"]}, {"page": "30th Academy Awards", "response": ["* The Bridge on the River Kwai\u00a0\u2013 Peter Taylor"]}]}}
