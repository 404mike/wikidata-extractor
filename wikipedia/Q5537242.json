In 1924\u201325, his first full season at the club, he was joint top scorer. He was used in all forward positions before settling as an outside-right, the position in which he played in the 1931 FA Cup Final defeat. In all he made 324 appearances for Birmingham and scored 107 goals, which ranks him fourth in the club's all-time top scorers table. In 1933 he moved to Plymouth Argyle, where he spent three seasons.\nHe was twice called up as reserve to the England team, in 1926 and 1928, but never played.He died in his native Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Second City derby", "response": ["| George Briggs"]}, {"page": "1931 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Chelsea provided stiffer opposition for the Birmingham team, a number of whose players were still recovering from influenza, on a St Andrew's pitch treacherous after overnight sleet. The visitors had much the better of the first half. Alex Jackson gave them the lead, and, in blizzard conditions, George Mills appeared to have scored in a goalmouth scramble, only for the goal to be disallowed after the Birmingham players drew the referee's attention to his linesman who had flagged for the ball having gone out of play. Six minutes into the second half, the lead had changed hands. First George Briggs crossed for a Bradford header, then the same pair combined for Curtis to put Birmingham ahead. Birmingham's defence held out until a misplaced clearance by Bob Gregg allowed Jackie Crawford to equalise. The replay at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge attracted a crowd of 74,365, then a ground record, with 6,000 locked out; spectators broke through the barriers and sat round the edge of the pitch. Briggs, in front of an empty goal,  allowed a centre from Curtis to pass between his legs \u2013 \"an amazing miss\" \u2013 before Chelsea centre-half John Townrow sustained an injury which forced him to leave the field. Chelsea reorganised their personnel, but early in the second half, right-half Sid Bishop was hurt twice in quick succession, leaving him in a worse condition than Townrow and his team short of numbers \u2013 no substitutes were permitted \u2013 with players in unaccustomed positions. Though they held out well, a goal from Jack Firth and two from Bradford, the second of which scored from an offside position, gave Birmingham a 3\u20130 victory.", "In the days leading up to the final, both teams made use of mid-week games to test players who were doubtful due to injury. Following Birmingham's reserve match against Huddersfield Town's reserves, George Briggs and Jimmy Cringan were pronounced fit to play in the final, but centre forward Joe Bradford's fitness was not decided until the Thursday morning. An injured knee had kept Bradford out of action since mid-March, and he played with the knee well bandaged during the match, which was played in front of \"about 12,000\" spectators at St Andrew's. Full back Bert Trentham was a doubt for Albion, but came through the first half of their friendly against Headingly \"quite satisfactorily\". The Birmingham team prepared for the final at Bushey, while the West Bromwich Albion team were based in Harrow.
