On 14 January 2006, whilst a match against Notts County was in progress, 21-year-old midfielder Mark Philo, who had made 19 appearances for the club, died in hospital after a car crash the previous night. His manager, John Gorman, paid tribute to him by saying, \"He was a fantastic kid. He lived for football and always had a smile on his face\". It was later revealed that Philo had been significantly over the drink-drive limit and veered onto the opposite side of the road, killing a 58-year-old mother of two. Just a few weeks later, Gorman's wife Myra died after a long illness, leading to him taking a period of compassionate leave away from the club."]}, {"page": "Philo, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Philo"]}]}}
