Several varieties of aluminum cones packed with explosive charges were mounted in the rocket's nose cone. 91 seconds after liftoff, at an altitude of , the charges were fired. A bright green flash ensued, observable from Palomar Observatory  away. Post-launch analysis suggested that at least two fragments from the exploding charges had soared away from the Earth with twice the kinetic energy necessary to reach escape velocity and become the first artificial satellites of the sun. When the achievement was announced the following month, it was compared favorably in the contemporary press to the Soviet launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, just 12 days before the Aerobee launch.  However, subsequent analysis by space historian Jonathan McDowell suggests that none of the payload fragments actually achieved escape velocity."]}, {"page": "K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line", "response": ["Works by Jonathan McDowell (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) and Thomas Gangale (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) in 2018 advocate that the demarcation of space should be at , citing as evidence von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's original notes and calculations (which concluded the boundary should be 270,000\u00a0ft), confirmation that orbiting objects can survive multiple perigees at altitudes around 80 to 90\u00a0km, plus functional, cultural, physical, technological, mathematical, and historical factors.
