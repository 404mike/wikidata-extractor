Four players, all members of the club's youth team, played only one game each.

Kettering took the lead in the first half before Gillingham scored twice.  Despite being forced to substitute their goalkeeper due to an injury before half-time, with former Gillingham midfielder Ian Docker taking over in goal, the Conference team levelled the scores in the second half and nearly held on for a draw.  Forster scored a winner in the 85th minute, however, meaning that Gillingham progressed past the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in five seasons.  In the second round their opponents were fellow Third Division team Colchester United.  The initial match, at Priestfield, resulted in a 1\u20131 draw, necessitating a replay at Layer Road in Colchester.  Gillingham won the replay 3\u20132 with goals from Forster, Andy Arnott and Henry.  The Premier League and First Division teams entered the competition in the third round, but Gillingham were paired with Huddersfield Town of the Second Division.  The initial match at Priestfield ended in a goalless draw, meaning another replay.  Gillingham lost 2\u20131 in the replay at Leeds Road and were eliminated from the competition."]}]}}
