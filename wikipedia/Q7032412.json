Capital's plans included moving Virgin Radio from 1 Golden Square to Capital's Leicester Square building and splitting programming between the AM and FM services. The Radio Authority approved the acquisition, but Nigel Griffiths, the Consumer Affairs Minister, referred the takeover to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). The MMC report into the takeover would not be issued until January 1998, and would recommend that the deal could only go ahead if Capital Gold was sold or Virgin's London FM licence was left out of the deal. However, the delay in approval of the Capital acquisition would ultimately lead to the deal not going through."]}, {"page": "List of people from Glasgow", "response": ["*Nigel Griffiths \u2013 Labour Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Nigel Griffiths"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2005 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edinburgh South || Nigel Griffiths || Labour || (boundary changes) || Labour"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: G", "response": ["*Nigel Griffiths"]}, {"page": "1994 Labour Party leadership election", "response": ["| Nigel Griffiths || Blair || Beckett"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*Nigel Griffiths, Edinburgh South, 1987\u20132010"]}, {"page": "British debate over veils", "response": ["Labour MP Nigel Griffiths, then Deputy Leader of the Commons, said \"it's all very well for Muslim women to say that they feel comfortable wearing the veil but ... the veil does not make other people feel comfortable.
