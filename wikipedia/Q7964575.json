His career spanned the difficult period when the theatres were closed during the English Civil War and the Interregnum, from 1642 to 1660.\nAccording to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), Clun and Charles Hart were boy players together with the King's Men in the years prior to the theatre closure. Clun was a member of a group of English actors who performed on the Continent, mainly in The Hague and Paris, between 1644 and 1646; he was also one of the former King's Men who tried to restart the company in December 1648, despite the parliamentarian regime's hostility to theatre. (The effort was not successful.)In the Restoration era, Clun gained particular notice as the Iago to Nicholas Burt's Othello in the earliest Restoration production of Shakespeare's play in 1660. Clun was among the thirteen actors who were initial sharers in the newly organized King's Company in 1661. In addition to Iago, Clun was strongly associated with the roles of Falstaff, Bessus in Beaumont and Fletcher's A King and No King, Smug in The Merry Devil of Edmonton, and Subtle in Jonson's The Alchemist. He also played Cacafogo in Fletcher's Rule a Wife and Have a Wife.\nClun may have reached the peak of his career in the title role in Fletcher's The Humorous Lieutenant; the King's Company played that drama for twelve days straight when they opened the lavish new Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in 1663. If so, his peak did not last for long: Clun was killed during a robbery near Kentish Town on the night of 2 August 1664. He was wounded in the arm by the thieves, bound hand and foot, and left in a ditch to bleed to death. Samuel Pepys, who had a strong admiration for Clun's acting, visited the spot of the murder three days after it occurred. He also reminisced in his Diary about Clun's skill onstage. (Pepys criticized Michael Mohun, the actor who took over the role of Iago, for not being as good in it as Clun had been.)\nAfter Clun's death, an anonymous verse elegy was published in his memory. The poet reminds his readers that Clun's performances in female roles a quarter-century earlier had \"made us weep, at seeming sorrow swell, / To see and hear like truth a fiction fell.\"\nJohn Aubrey mentioned Clun in his famous Brief Lives. Aubrey wrote that \"Ben Jonson had one eye lower than the other, and bigger, like Clun, the player; perhaps he begot Clun.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Othello", "response": ["At the start of the Restoration era, on 11 October 1660, Samuel Pepys saw the play at the Cockpit Theatre. Nicholas Burt played the lead, with Charles Hart as Cassio; Walter Clun won fame for his Iago. Soon after, on 8 December 1660, Thomas Killigrew's new King's Company acted the play at their Vere Street theatre, with Margaret Hughes as Desdemona \u2013 probably the first time a professional actress appeared on a public stage in England."]}, {"page": "Thomas Killigrew", "response": ["Along with Sir William Davenant, he was given a royal warrant to form a theatre company in 1660\u2014which gave Killigrew a key role in the revival of English drama. Killigrew beat Davenant to a debut, at Gibbon's Tennis Court in Clare Market, with the new King's Company. Its original members were Michael Mohun, William Wintershall, Robert Shatterell, William Cartwright, Walter Clun, Charles Hart and Nicholas Burt. They played for a time at the old Red Bull Theatre, but in 1663 the company moved to the new Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. (Unfortunately, Killigrew gained a reputation as an incompetent manager; he was constantly in disputes with his actors and had to bribe his stars to keep working for him.) Killigrew staged plays by Aphra Behn, John Dryden, William Wycherley...and Thomas Killigrew, as well as revivals of Beaumont and Fletcher. Having inherited the rights and repertory of the old King's Men, the King's Company  performed many of Shakespeare's works, in the rewritten forms that were so popular at the time and so disparaged later. Two Killigrew productions of his own Parson's Wedding, in 1664 and 1672-3, were cast entirely with women."]}, {"page": "Charles Hart (actor)", "response": ["Hart then returned to acting; evidence suggests he was with other displaced English actors in Europe in 1646.Judith Milhous and Robert D.

In 1648, Hart, Walter Clun and eight other actors, were involved in an attempt to restart the King's Men company during the Puritan Commonwealth, which, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed. On 5 February 1648, at the Cockpit Theatre, Hart and other King's Men were arrested for violating the ban against theatrical performance; they were caught in the midst of a performance of Rollo Duke of Normandy (in which Hart played the character Otto). Hart and the others were imprisoned for a short time, then released.Milhous and Hume, pp. 491-2."]}, {"page": "King's Company", "response": ["Among its senior actors, the early King's Company counted many of the more experienced actors still working at the time: Michael Mohun, Charles Hart, John Lacy, Edward Kynaston, Walter Clun, Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth Weaver were part of the initial group. Betterton would be \"seduced\" away to the Duke's Company by 5 November the same year, not long before the Lord Chamberlain issued orders forbidding such transfers from one company to the other. Such orders would be encoded into the 1662 letters patent as well.Milhous, p. 8."]}, {"page": "King's Men personnel", "response": ["* Walter Clun \u2013 actor.
