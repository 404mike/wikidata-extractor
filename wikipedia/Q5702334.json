Gardner began her teaching career at the University of Birmingham, and from 1966 to 1975 was a Merton Professor of English Literature, the first woman to have that position. She was best known for her work on the poets John Donne and T. S. Eliot, but also published on John Milton and William Shakespeare. She published over a dozen books, and received multiple honours.\nHer critical stance was traditional and focused on history and biography; it involved the work's historical context, the personal habits of the author, and the relationship of the text to the time period. One of her beliefs was that a literary critic's job is to assist other people in reading for themselves.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Donne", "response": ["Some scholars believe that Donne's literary works reflect the changing trends of his life, with love poetry and satires from his youth and religious sermons during his later years.

Commenting on his religious poetry later in the 17th century, Richard Baxter said, \"Herbert speaks to God like one that really believeth in God, and whose business in the world is most with God. Heart-work and heaven-work make up his books\". Helen Gardner later added \"head-work\" to this characterisation in acknowledgement of his \"intellectual vivacity\". It has also been pointed out how Herbert uses puns and wordplay to \"convey the relationships between the world of daily reality and the world of transcendent reality that gives it meaning.

Johnson's remark that \"To write on their plan it was at least necessary to read and think\" only echoed its recognition a century and a half before in the many tributes paid to Donne on his death. For example, Jasper Mayne's comment that for the fellow readers of his work, \"Wee are thought wits, when 'tis understood\".Elegies, p. 393 Coupled with it went a vigorous sense of the speaking voice. It begins with the rough versification of the satires written by Donne and others in his circle such as Everard Gilpin and John Roe. Later it modulates into the thoughtful religious poems of the next generation with their exclamatory or conversational openings and their sense of the mind playing over the subject and examining it from all sides.

He neither intends to mock religion by exalting love beside it nor aims to poke fun at love by comparing it to sainthood. Instead, Brooks argues, the apparent contradiction in taking both seriously translates into a truer account of both love and spirituality.
