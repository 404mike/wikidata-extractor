In his first spell at the club he played largely as a striker, alongside Chris Scannell. He was allowed to leave the club to join Lisburn Distillery in March 2003 on a free transfer, but returned in August 2004, reportedly only beating the transfer deadline by a matter of hours.\nUpon his return to Solitude, manager Liam Beckett decided that to deploy Downey as a midfielder, and since then he has made the position his own. After a good season in 2005/06, helping Cliftonville to a 5th-placed finish, Downey attracted the interest of the likes of Glentoran and Portadown. He rejected their advances however, and opted to stay with the Reds. In January 2007 however, the BBC reported that Linfield and Derry City had made approaches for the player, at the same time he was also linked with English sides Oldham Athletic and Peterborough United F.C. and Gretna F.C. from the Scottish First Division.Downey joined Linfield later that month and his first game for the Blues was against Portadown F.C. on 20 January 2007. Part of the deal taking him to Linfield was that Cliftonville would be allowed to use Linfield's Windsor Park ground for European games. This in turn enabled Cliftonville to obtain a UEFA licence in April 2007. He quickly established himself in the Linfield side, earning a place in the Irish League side that beat the England semi-professional side in February 2007. However, on 7 March 2007 he was ruled out for the rest of the season after a cruciate ligament injury picked up in the Setanta Cup game against Glentoran two days previously.Rejoined Cliftonville in September 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eddie Patterson", "response": ["Patterson's second season in the job proved even more successful than the first. After the disappointment of losing the CIS Cup final 1\u20130 to city rivals Glentoran F.C., his side went on to win the County Antrim Shield in January 2007 by defeating Lisburn Distillery F.C. 2\u20131 in the final. Both goals were scored by Mark Holland. Patterson also signed Vincent Sweeney from Limavady United F.C. and Daniel Lyons on loan from Donegal Celtic F.C.. However John O'Loughlin (Finn Harps F.C.) and Conor Downey (Linfield F.C.) both left the club. Patterson's side also reached the semi-final of the Irish Cup but lost a penalty shootout to Dungannon Swifts. Cliftonville finished third in the league, narrowly missing out on second place, but nevertheless qualifying for the Intertoto Cup and the Setanta Cup for the following season."]}, {"page": "History of Derry City F.C.", "response": ["Although some reports claimed that Curtis Fleming was to take the vacant assistant manager's position left at the club by the departure of much of Stephen Kenny's staff,\"Fenlon appoints backroom team \", Eleven-a-side.com, 19 December 2006.
