Baron Munchausen is full of whimsy, fantasy, bright colors, and fabulous characters. None is as fantastic as the Baron himself as played, with a twinkle in his eye, by the grand John Neville.\"", "Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and found that it was \"told with a cheerfulness and a light touch that never betray the time and money it took to create them\", appreciating \"the sly wit and satire that sneaks in here and there from director Terry Gilliam and his collaborators, who were mostly forged in the mill of Monty Python\". While considering the film's special effects as \"astonishing\", Ebert also contended \"the movie is slow to get off the ground\" and \"sometimes the movie fails on the basic level of making itself clear. We're not always sure who is who, how they are related, or why we should care\". But \"allowing for the unsuccessful passages there is a lot here to treasure\", and Ebert concluded overall, \"this is a vast and commodious work\", \"the wit and the spectacle of Baron Munchausen are considerable achievements\".
