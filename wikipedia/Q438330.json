Gingrich and Forstchen neglected to write the promised sequel; instead, they wrote a trilogy about the American Civil War, starting with Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War, in which the Confederates win a victory at the Battle of Gettysburg - however, after Lincoln responds by bringing Grant and his forces to the eastern theater, the Army of Northern Virginia is soon trapped and destroyed in Maryland, and the war ends within weeks.

In a 2009 retrospective, Jo Walton wrote that Starship Troopers was \"military SF done extremely well\". She went on to argue that \"Heinlein was absolutely at his peak when he wrote this in 1959. He had so much technical stylistic mastery of the craft of writing science fiction that he could [tell the story] 'backwards and in high heels' and get away with it.\" Others referred to it as very readable, and found the military scenes compelling. Heinlein's descriptions of training and boot camp in the novel, based on his own experiences in the military, have been described as being rendered with remarkable skill. A 1960 review in the New York Herald Tribune praised the \"brilliantly written\" passages describing infantry combat, and also called attention to the discussion of weapons and armor, which, according to other reviewers, demonstrated Heinlein's \"undiminished talent for invention\". Scholar George Slusser described the book in 1986 as the \"ultimately convincing space-war epic\", praising in particular the \"precisely imagined\" weapons and tactics, while a 1979 science fiction encyclopedia referred to it as the \"slickest\" of Heinlein's juvenile books."]}, {"page": "Ursula K. Le Guin", "response": ["Le Guin received rapid recognition after the publication of The Left Hand of Darkness in 1969, and by the 1970s she was among the best known writers in the field. Her books sold many millions of copies, and were translated into more than 40 languages; several remain in print many decades after their first publication. Her work received intense academic attention; she has been described as being the \"premier writer of both fantasy and science fiction\" of the 1970s, the most frequently discussed science fiction writer of the 1970s, and over her career, as intensively studied as Philip K. Dick. Later in her career, she also received recognition from mainstream literary critics: in an obituary, Jo Walton stated that Le Guin \"was so good that the mainstream couldn't dismiss SF any more\". According to scholar Donna White, Le Guin was a \"major voice in American letters\", whose writing was the subject of many volumes of literary critique, more than two hundred scholarly articles, and a number of dissertations.", "Le Guin had a considerable influence on the field of speculative fiction; Jo Walton argued that Le Guin played a large role in both broadening the genre and helping genre writers achieve mainstream recognition. The Earthsea books are cited as having a wide impact, including outside the field of literature. Atwood considers A Wizard of Earthsea one of the \"wellsprings\" of fantasy literature, and modern writers have credited the book for the idea of a \"wizard school\", later made famous by the Harry Potter series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in Harry Potter. The notion that names can exert power is a theme in the Earthsea series; critics have suggested that this inspired Hayao Miyazaki's use of the idea in his 2001 film Spirited Away.", "Several prominent authors acknowledge Le Guin's influence on their own writing. Jo Walton wrote that \"her way of looking at the world had a huge influence on me, not just as a writer but as a human being\". Other writers she influenced include Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, as well as David Mitchell, Gaiman, Algis Budrys, Goonan, and Iain Banks. Mitchell, author of books such as Cloud Atlas, described A Wizard of Earthsea as having a strong influence on him, and said that he felt a desire to \"wield words with the same power as Ursula Le Guin\". Le Guin is also credited with inspiring several female science fiction authors in the 1970s, including Vonda McIntyre. When McIntyre established a writers' workshop in Seattle in 1971, Le Guin was one of the instructors. Film-maker Arwen Curry began production on a documentary about Le Guin in 2009, filming \"dozens\" of hours of interviews with the author as well as many other writers and artists who have been inspired by her. Curry launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to finish the documentary in early 2016 after winning a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities."]}, {"page": "Girolamo Savonarola", "response": ["* The historical fantasy and alternate history novel Lent (2019) by Jo Walton is a retelling\" of Savonarola's life."]}, {"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Jo Walton (born 1964)"]}, {"page": "The Crow Road", "response": ["*2009 retrospective review by Jo Walton"]}, {"page": "Friday (novel)", "response": ["Jo Walton wrote of Friday in 2009 as \"The worst book I love\": \"It's a book about passing, about what makes you human. ...

Every sentence and every paragraph and page and chapter lead on to the next, but it's just one thing after another, there's no real connection going on. It has no plot, it's a set of incidents that look as if they're going somewhere and don't ever resolve, just stop.

Upon its publication British critic Naomi Lewis called it an \"extraordinary book\", while scholar Andrew Wolk called the series a masterpiece of fantasy. The prose in the novel received praise; a 1996 reference book on science fiction described them as among the best regarded fantasies, and went on to call the series a \"fast-paced narrative\" that explored serious questions of morality, power, and identity, Science fiction writer Jo Walton said that it was a \"beautifully written\" book. She went on to write that a \"lesser writer\" would have ended the novel after the earthquake and the collapse of the Tombs, but that the last section of the story, about Ged and Tenar's travel, \"do a lot to ground it\", making it \"solid and well rooted as ever\". Speculative fiction scholar Mike Cadden praised the characterization in the novel, calling Tenar the \"finest and most complicated multiple character in the Earthsea series, and maybe in all of her fiction\". However, scholar Sandra Lindow referred to the conclusion of the novel, and particularly the conclusion of Ged and Tenar's relationship, as unsatisfying. A 2016 review in The Huffington Post praised the religious theme in the novel, saying Le Guin \"skillfully illustrates the way religious conviction can permeate and give meaning to a life\", while Entertainment Weekly referred to it as \"a classic of stealth-missile literature, a fantasy adventure that's actually a feminist horror thriller\"."]}, {"page": "Babel-17", "response": ["* 2009 retrospective review by Jo Walton: \"Babel 17 was published in 1966, the year in which I learned to talk.\""]}, {"page": "Charles Lindbergh", "response": ["There have been several alternate history novels depicting Lindbergh's alleged Nazi-sympathies and non-interventionist views during the first half of World War II.
