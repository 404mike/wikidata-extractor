She and her chief collaborator, Margaret Crosfield, are credited with undertaking research that substantially advanced understanding of the geological history of northeast Wales. She wrote several books on geology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Skeat", "response": ["* Ethel Skeat (1865\u20131939), English paleontologist"]}, {"page": "Henry Woods (geologist)", "response": ["In 1890 Woods earned a B.A. from the University of Cambridge, then became there curator of the Woodwardian Museum, earning an M.A. in 1894. In 1895 he won the Sedgwick prize. At Cambridge University, Woods was from 1892 to 1899 a demonstrator in paleobotany, and from 1894 to 1899 a demonstrator in paleozoology until his promotion to lecturer. From 1899 until his retirement in 1934 he was a lecturer in paleontology at Cambridge. In 1910 he married paleontologist Ethel Skeat, the daughter of Walter William Skeat, professor of Anglo-Saxon. Even after his retirement, Woods remained at the university as a librarian for the paleontology department until he was over eighty."]}, {"page": "Margaret Crosfield", "response": ["Crosfield became an active member of the Geologists' Association in 1892, later becoming a council member in 1918. In 1894 she was elected to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. She was the first, due to alphabetical primacy, of eight women to be elected Fellows of the Geological Society of London, under the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919.  Prior to that, in 1907, a decision was made by the Society as associates, under the condition they declared themselves as geological investigators or summitted their own original research. She also was a member of the Paleontological Society from 1907\u20131932. She collaborated with Gertrude Elles (1872\u20131960), Ethel Wood (1871\u20131945), and Ethel Skeat (1869\u20131939). Crosfield and Skeat investigated the Denbighshire grits and flags from 1906 to 1909 and in 1911, using graptolite to establish a sequence.", "Crosfield published three research papers. The first was written with Ethel Skeat on the geology of Carmarthen in 1896. The paper was clear and formed the basis of the geological map produced by the British Geological Survey for the area. Her second publication was with Mary Johnston, on the Wenlock limestone of Shropshire. Finally, she wrote again with Ethel Skeat in 1925 on the geology of the Silurian rocks of the Clywdian Range, largely focusing on structural geology, notably, the cross sections and erosion of the region.", "These notes contained field notes, and records of specimen locations still seen in British Geological Survey in Key Worth and the Grosvenor Museum in Chester. In 1906 Professors McKenny Hughes, and Marr of the University of Cambridge along with Professor Lapworth of Mason Science College initiated a small group of woman including Margaret Crosfield and Ethel Skeat to research the Silurian and Ordovician rock of North Wales and the borders to solve the \"Silurian problem.\" Unfortunately, the research of developing and understanding the Silurian and Ordovician stratigraphy of Northeast Wales is lost over time. Margaret surveyed a four-mile radius around Carmarthen and while examining the syncline she discovered new features of stratigraphy and also collected a new species of trilobite."]}, {"page": "List of female scientists in the 20th century", "response": ["* Ethel Skeat (1865\u20131939), English paleontologist and geologist"]}, {"page": "Ethel Gertrude Skeat", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ethel Skeat"]}, {"page": "Ethel Woods", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ethel Skeat"]}, {"page": "Ethel Gertrude Woods", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ethel Skeat"]}]}}
