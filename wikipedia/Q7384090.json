These matches saw Paul Buckle begin to experiment with his squad selection with second choice keeper Danny Potter being brought in to give Scott Bevan a well-deserved break and left back Lathaniel Rowe-Turner deputising for the ever-present Kevin Nicholson.  Both players rewarded the manager's faith with Potter keeping clean sheets in his first three games and Rowe-Turner scoring on his first league start of the season against Barnet.

With that in mind, Paul Buckle once again dipped into the loan market.  Although current loanee Ryan Gilligan unfortunately had to make an early return to Northampton following a family bereavement, Buckle was able to make an immediate replacement in the form of young Derby midfielder Ben Pringle.  Shortly afterwards, Plainmoor also saw the arrival of two loan strikers in Ronan Murray from Ipswich Town and Gavin Tomlin of Dagenham & Redbridge.   With Buckle eventually negotiating for both forwards to remain with Torquay until the end of the season, the Gulls now had a variety of attacking options with the likes of Jake Robinson, Chris Zebroski, Eunan O\u2019Kane and Billy Kee already causing problems to opposition defences.", "|Ryan Gilligan"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Ryan Gilligan", "| 7 || RM || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Ryan Gilligan", "| Ryan Gilligan"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Newport County A.F.C. season", "response": ["|12||MF||align=\"left\"| Ryan Gilligan||3 (3)||0||0 (0)||0||3 (3)||0", "|18 Aug 2011||MF|| Ryan Gilligan||Northampton Town||January transfer window"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 20 || RM || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Ryan Gilligan", "| Ryan Gilligan"]}, {"page": "Banga (album)", "response": ["*Ryan Gilligan \u2013 mixing assistant, Pro Tools engineer (3)"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 June 2012 || CM ||  || Ryan Gilligan || \u00d6stersunds FK || Released ||"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Veikkausliiga players", "response": ["* Ryan Gilligan \u2013 Kemi Kings \u2013 2016"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 28 || RM || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Ryan Gilligan"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 18 || CM || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Ryan Gilligan"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 28 || RM || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Ryan Gilligan"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 18 || RM || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Ryan Gilligan"]}, {"page": "2017 PS Kemi Kings season", "response": ["||MF||||87||Ryan Gilligan||0||1||1", "|87||||MF||Ryan Gilligan||0||0||1||0||1||0"]}]}}
