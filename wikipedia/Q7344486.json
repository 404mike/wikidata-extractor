In particular the displays were set out in a new taxonomic order. More retired in 1887 due to ill-health, which resulted in Robert Francis Scharff becoming the new Curator in March 1887. In 1890, the purpose built museum for Irish Antiquities, saw the collections of Art and Industry, as well as the herbarium and economic collections moved into this building. Owing to the museum's reorganisation, the title of Curator was changed to Keeper. The 1890s saw the first female members of staff with Matilda Knowles and Jane Stephens appointed as Technical Assistants. A bronze statue of Surgeon-Major Thomas Heazle Parke was commissioned in the 1890s which still stands at front of the building."]}, {"page": "Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn", "response": ["*Robert Francis Scharff"]}, {"page": "Scharff", "response": ["* Robert Francis Scharff, (1858 -1934), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "Bini free-tailed bat", "response": ["The Bini free-tailed bat was described as a new species in 1900 by English zoologist Robert Francis Scharff.

Due to the marriage bar in Ireland, Stephens had to resign her post in the Museum. Once retired, Stephens appears to have stopped any scientific research, which was not unusual for married women at that time. They had one daughter, Marjorie Patience, born in 1921. Scharff subsequently retired in 1921 and the family moved to Worthing, where Scharff died in 1934. Stephens died in 1959 in London. The lack of an obituary to Stephens has been attributed to the fact that she outlived many of those she worked with during her 15-year career in Ireland, such as Matilda Cullen Knowles, Eileen Barnes and Robert Lloyd Praeger."]}, {"page": "Eileen Barnes", "response": ["Barnes illustrated cephalopoda for Annie Massy, such as those collected by the 1910-1913 British Antarctic expedition. She undertook similar illustration work for the sponge expert, Jane Stephens, illustrating a number of her publications. She also illustrated the Foraminifera collected during the Clare Island Survey. Her work was highly regarded by Praeger, who even went as far as to name one of his plants after her (Sedum barnesianum). Barnes' works have been featured in numerous books and monographs, and still highly regarded today, especially her sedums (stonecrops) and sempervivums (house leeks). She worked with Robert Francis Scharff to reconstruct and illustrate specimens of the Giant Irish deer. Barnes also undertook some cartographic work with the Geological Survey of Ireland, and restoration of archaeological artefacts from the Royal Irish Academy.

For the first time in Ireland, evidence of the Arctic lemming was also discovered, drawing headlines around the country. Another important recovery was that of a metacarpus of reindeer, discovered above an area of burnt charcoal. This suggests that reindeer in Ireland survived until the human period."]}, {"page": "R.
