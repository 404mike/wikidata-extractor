He never fully established himself in the United first-team however, and was loaned out to Carlisle United and Stockport County. During a further loan spell at Royal Antwerp, he was banned from football for life for attacking a Belgian referee, although the ban was later substantially reduced.\nIn 2002, Wallwork moved to West Bromwich Albion, where he was the Player of the Year for 2004\u201305. He was not always a regular in the side however, and spent time on loan at Bradford City, Barnsley and Huddersfield Town. His spell at Barnsley was cut short when he was stabbed several times in a nightclub, suffering wounds to his hand, stomach and back, which caused him to miss more than two months of the 2006\u201307 season. Wallwork was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday in January 2008, but was released just four months later.\nIn December 2011, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of handling stolen cars. He returned to football in 2014 signing for Ashton United. In March 2021, he received an 18-month suspended sentence and was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Bromwich Albion F.C.", "response": ["|2005|| Ronnie Wallwork"]}, {"page": "Newton Heath", "response": ["The area has produced a number of notable footballers who has distinguished careers in both the national and international game.

Following this start the club then won 15 matches in a row and Higginbotham become popular with the fans. However, the season ended with defeat in a play-off game. After the final whistle Ronnie Wallwork allegedly attacked the referee Amand Ancion. Higginbotham was subsequently banned from football for a year for his alleged involvement in the attack. In September 1999, a Belgian court reduced Higginbotham's ban to four months. Ancion maintained that Wallwork had grabbed him by the throat and that Higginbotham had headbutted him. Higginbotham always maintained his innocence, stating that he had tried to intervene peacefully after Wallwork had confronted Ancion in an aggressive manner. Alex Ferguson believed the player's innocence and handed both players four-year contracts as the club appealed their suspensions."]}, {"page": "Ronald Wallwork", "response": ["* Ronnie Wallwork (born 1977), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Jon Worthington", "response": ["Born in nearby Dewsbury, Worthington began playing for Huddersfield Town at the age of nine, eventually moving through the club's youth academy and into the first team.

Other midfielders have attempted to fill that role such as Michael Collins, Andy Holdsworth, Adnan Ahmed, Mark Hudson and loan signing Ronnie Wallwork, but fans felt that the Town midfield four was incomplete without Worthington in the middle."]}]}}
