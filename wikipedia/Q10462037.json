However, McDermott stuck with largely the same squad from the previous season. McDermott's side began the season slowly with a succession of draws and losses; however, a surge of form through October to December saw Leeds reach a high of 5th place in the table, consistently among the playoff places. A sharp loss of form quickly followed though, with a five match losing streak through late December and January, (including a surprise FA Cup loss to Rochdale and a 6\u20130 derby loss to Sheffield Wednesday) seeing Brian McDermott's side drop to 12th place."]}, {"page": "Dave Hockaday", "response": ["Two more defeats followed, 2\u20130 against Brighton and 4\u20131 against Watford \u2013 a game which Leeds finished with nine men.

But Hockaday's reprieve did not last long. On 27 August 2014, Leeds were knocked out of the League Cup by League 1 side Bradford City. Leeds had to play most of the game with ten men after a red card was shown to Luke Murphy, who became the fourth Leeds player to be sent off in Hockaday's first six games in charge (the others being Gaetano Berardi in the previous round of the Cup against Accrington Stanley, and Giuseppe Bellusci and Sam Byram against Watford)."]}, {"page": "Byron Moore", "response": ["Moore scored ten goals in 49 appearances in the 2011\u201312 campaign as he continued to progress under the stewardship of new manager Steve Davis.

Despite a brief period linking him with the vacant Wolves managerial position, Davis remained at the Alex. The 2013\u201314 season was less successful than Davis' previous seasons, compacted even more after seven first team players were held by Devon and Cornwall Police for an alleged sexual assault during the team's pre-season training in Redruth. The players were cleared of all charges in November, a few months into the new campaign. Davis described the decision as a \"noose being removed from our necks\" citing the case as one of the reasons for the team's poor start to the campaign. Further to the sex assault allegations, Davis was also having attitude issues with summer signing Anthony Grant and former Newcastle youngster Brad Inman - listing the pair on loan and isolating them from the rest of the squad in training labelling the pair as a \"disruption.\" The pair were later reinstated to the squad and first team duties following an improvement in their attitudes and helped Crewe avoid relegation on the last day of the season with a 2\u20131 victory over local rivals Preston North End."]}, {"page": "Alsager School", "response": ["* Luke Murphy, footballer"]}, {"page": "Greg Pearson", "response": ["In January 2012 Pearson went out on loan again, this time to Crewe Alexandra.
