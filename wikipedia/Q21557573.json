Facing the front of the site, stood the Johnson Smirke Building, named for its designer James Johnson and builder Robert Smirke. Construction was supervised by the architect John Lidbury Poole (father of the famous singer, Elizabeth Poole). This building was flanked on both sides by gatehouses behind which another building housed the mint's new machinery. A number of other smaller buildings were also erected, which housed mint officers and staff members. The entire site was protected by a boundary wall which was patrolled by the Royal Mint's military guard."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Poole", "response": ["Elizabeth Poole or Pole (25 August 1588 \u2013 21 May 1654) was an English settler in Plymouth Colony who founded the town of Taunton, Massachusetts.
