Tupper had been encouraged to publish by Henry Stebbing. A typical example is: \"Well-timed silence hath more eloquence than speech\".  His work met at first with moderate success in Britain, while in the United States it was almost a total failure. It slowly picked up steam, however. Over the next thirty years, by 1867, it passed through forty large editions in Britain, while nearly a million copies were sold in the United States. His blank verse is essentially prose cut up into suitable lengths; but Proverbial Philosophy contained apt and striking expressions and appealed to a large section of the public."]}, {"page": "Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing", "response": ["Thomas Roscoe Rede Stebbing was born on 6 February 1835 in Euston Square, London, the seventh of thirteen or fourteen children, to the clergyman and editor of the Athenaeum, Henry Stebbing, and his wife, Mary Griffin.
