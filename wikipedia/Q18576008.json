Magdalen Greek 17 (Gregory-Aland \\mathfrak{P}64) and whence they have their name. When the fragments were finally published by Colin Henderson Roberts in 1953, illustrated with a photograph, the hand was characterized as \"an early predecessor of the so-called 'Biblical Uncial which began to emerge towards the end of the 2nd century. The uncial style is epitomised by the later biblical Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Comparative paleographical analysis has remained the methodological key for dating the manuscript, but there is no consensus on the dating of the papyrus. Estimates have ranged from the 1st century to the 4th century AD."]}, {"page": "Michael Baigent", "response": ["Historian Marina Warner noted the book to be filled with lurid falsehoods and distorted reasoning.The Times, 18 January 1982. Soon enough, the authors had a public clash on a BBC broadcast with her and the Bishop of Birmingham. In a scathing review of the book for The Observer, critic Anthony Burgess wrote: \"It is typical of my unregenerable soul that I can only see this as a marvelous theme for a novel.\" A Kirkus Review described the work as an intriguing phantasmagoria wherein the authors jumped \"perilous heights to reach crazy conclusions\". Colin Henderson Roberts, reviewing for London Review of Books, noted that the work advanced a preposterous hypothesis and made major blunders in its quest to get simple reductive answers from complex questions."]}, {"page": "Charles Bousfield Huleatt", "response": ["When illustrated fragments were published by Colin Henderson Roberts in the 1950s, years after the reverend's death, they were described as \"an early predecessor of the so-called 'Biblical Uncial.
