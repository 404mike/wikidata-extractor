So we\u2019ll touch on Ripper in that way but not dig anybody up or change the canonical five... All the period depictions I\u2019d seen of that particular crime story had almost been a bit too well behaved in a slightly slower way and shots have to be a bit wider to show off the nice furniture, but if you can think of something awful, it was happening [in Victorian London].\"", "PopMatters reviewed the debut episode, remarking:  The effects of such moments are shaped by writer/creator Richard Warlow and episode director Tom Shankland\u2019s attention to the period details: streets are sooty, gaslight creates flickering shadows, and stone floors make footsteps seem chilling. These details help make Ripper Street a compelling procedural, its long form narrative and deliberate pace different from the CSI and Law & Order clones. But the show also bears traces of contemporary influences: an underground boxing club sequence in the first episode resembles similar scenes in Sherlock Holmes (2009) so much that a coincidence is hard to imagine. Equally derivative, some overt efforts to shock viewers deliver graphic violence and some nudity, courtesy of the evolving technology of photography, as it\u2019s inspiring an evolving \"smut\" industry.
