Toshiko finds the courage to ask Owen on a date, and he does eventually accept. Shortly afterwards however, on a mission assisted by Dr Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) of UNIT, Owen is shot dead by Dr Aaron Copley (Alan Dale). Not willing to let Owen die, Jack tracks down and uses the mysterious resurrection gauntlet to restore Owen to life: however, this glove works differently from the one from previous episodes, and Owen is left in a permanent state of living death. Owen is left to despair at his inability to eat, to drink, to enjoy sex and feel the beat of his own heart or heal from wounds, with the final point becoming a logistical concern after he breaks a finger on one of his hands, rendering that hand permanently limited as the bones will never mend. Despite being dead, he is forced to exercise regularly to avoid the onset of rigor mortis. His despair at his undead state causes Owen to become severely depressed and even attempt suicide, via drowning, only to find that he has no breath so it doesn't work. Mysteriously, Weevils also begin to follow Owen as if in worship. Owen is discharged again from Torchwood, but returns to his position after proving his sustained value as a field agent, with certain stealth advantages due to not feeling pain or having a heat signature. In subsequent episodes, two alien species ignore Owen's presence as being dead makes him of no use to them. The flashback-centric episode \"Fragments\" sheds light on how Owen came to join Torchwood: Owen's fianc\u00e9e Katie (Andrea Lowe) developed a parasitic alien tumor, which brought him to encounter Jack when she died; Jack notes Owen's determination and medical brilliance, and so hires him.

She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who, after Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and before Donna Noble (Catherine Tate). According to the character's creator and executive producer Russell T Davies in his non-fiction book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale, the character was developed from the beginning with the intention of appearing for a whole of the 2007 series, and to later make guest appearances in subsequent series and crossover appearances in the show's two spin-offs; Martha subsequently made guest appearances in Torchwood series two and in Doctor Who series four in 2008 and special episode \"The End of Time\" in 2010. Martha was also intended to make guest appearances in the 2009 series of Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures, but could not due to the actress's other work commitments.", "Freema Agyeman's first appearance in Doctor Who was in the second series (2006) episode, \"Army of Ghosts\", where she played Adeola Oshodi, Martha's cousin.", "Martha Jones is introduced in the third series (2007) of Doctor Who, first appearing in the episode \"Smith and Jones\". When the hospital she works at is teleported to the Moon, medical student Martha helps save the day alongside an alien time traveller known only as The Doctor (David Tennant). To thank her for her help, The Doctor invites her to join him for a supposed single trip in his time machine the TARDIS, but later accepts her as his full-time \"companion\", admitting that she was \"never just a passenger\", and he even gives her the key to the TARDIS in the episode, \"42\". Martha becomes frustrated because The Doctor is oblivious to her feelings for him, and she expresses concern that she is simply a rebound after The Doctor's painful loss of his previous companion, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper). When the amnesiac Doctor falls in love in the two-part story \"Human Nature\" and \"The Family of Blood\", a pained Martha claims \"You had to go and fall in love with a human... and it wasn't me\". In the series finale, \"The Sound of Drums\" and \"Last of the Time Lords\", in which The Doctor's nemesis The Master (John Simm) takes over planet Earth, capturing both The Doctor and fellow companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), Martha manages to escape by teleporting away but is left alone to save the world. On the run from The Master, she spends a year travelling the world in a plan which restores the incapacitated Doctor and reverses time, undoing The Master's actions. Able to remember the events during The Master's reign, Martha then leaves the TARDIS of her own accord, telling The Doctor that she cannot waste her life pining for someone when the relationship cannot happen, but promises that she will see him again.

In books, Martha appears in the \"New Series Adventures\" series of Doctor Who novels, published by BBC Books. The first book published was a \"Quick Reads\" novel, Made of Steel by Terrance Dicks (published prior to her first television appearance), and the character subsequently appeared in all novels in the series, starting with Sting of the Zygons by Stephen Cole and most recently in The Many Hands by Dale Smith. Freema Agyeman physically represents the character on the cover of every novel.

Agyeman speculated that Martha, by contrast, travels with the Doctor for the adventure, rather than because of a need for guidance or education (Agyeman also told The Newspaper that Martha hopes to eventually go back to Earth and finish her medical education). In addition, Martha's family appears to be of a higher social class than Rose; whereas Rose's family was fairly typically working class, Martha's family appears to be wealthier (her father owns what appears to be a late model Mercedes-Benz convertible, and the clothes worn by her family are substantially more in line with fashion), probably middle to upper middle class.", "Drawing from her creator's pool of recurring names, Martha and her family share the last name \"Jones\" with many other Russell T Davies-penned characters.

Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him to get a grip of the character on the blank page. In casting Martha, the actress Freema Agyeman was reused from her minor role as Adeola Oshodi, in the Series 2 episode \"Army of Ghosts\".
