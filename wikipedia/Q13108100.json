Another brother George was an antiquarian, founder of a local liberal newspaper and a prominent writer on economic and social matters. King's parents both died from phthisis (tuberculosis), the father in November 1845 aged thirty six and the mother in 1850 at the age of forty. Orphaned at the age of ten, George was taken care of by his namesake uncle. After studying at the Aberdeen Grammar School where he was nicknamed \"Tertius\" to distinguish him from other \"King\" namesakes, a name that stuck. One of his teachers was Patrick Geddes. Although a good student, his health was poor and he was forced to leave in 1854. The family was associated with the Free church but King later favoured the Anglican church. For a while he worked in his uncle's press business but he continued to take a greater interest in natural history, an interest that had developed in his youth. He started putting together a collection in his work place, something the printer uncle despised. At the age of eighteen King decided to pursue a medical education and entered the University of Aberdeen in 1861, where he was influenced by his teachers George Dickie, Alexander Harvey and John Struthers."]}, {"page": "William Thompson (naturalist)", "response": ["George Dickie's Flora of Ulster contains records of Thompson's frequent botanical contributions and his Hortus Siccus and he is mentioned in William Baird's Natural History of British Entomostraca.", "Excerpts from Thompson's letters and his notes were edited and published as the fourth volume of The Natural History of Ireland, which focused on invertebrates and non-avian vertebrates, by George Dickie, James Ramsey Garrett and Robert Patterson in 1856, four years after his death."]}, {"page": "Belfast Natural History Society", "response": ["* George Dickie"]}, {"page": "George Crawford Hyndman", "response": ["Hyndman was a member of the Belfast Dredging Committee (other members were George Dickie, Edward Waller and John Gwyn Jeffreys).
