His twelve-year spell with Spurs yielded 299 league appearances, scoring 34 goals. He won the League Cup with Spurs in 1999, and was then runners-up in the same tournament again in 2002. He also played in the Football League for Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers before finishing his career with AFC Bournemouth. In his final ever game as a professional player he came off the bench to score the winner with a spectacular volley in a 3-2 win for Bournemouth on 6 December 2008. He was capped 30 times by England, scoring 7 goals and being ever present in the squads at Euro 96 and World Cup 98.\nSince retirement, Anderton has largely worked as a pundit, notably for Canada's The Sports Network. He now lives in the United States and was made honorary president of Arlington Spurs supporters club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Beckham", "response": ["United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\"), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994\u201395 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3\u20131 defeat at Aston Villa,The most famous comment was Alan Hansen's \"You can't win anything with kids\", quoted in The Boss 405. Beckham scored United's goal (his first for them in the league) from a distance of around 30\u00a0metres. with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game.

As England were hosting UEFA Euro 1996 they did not have to go through the qualification process, so they instead played numerous friendlies, most of which featured Gascoigne in the starting line-up. The last of these games was played in Hong Kong, after which numerous England players were photographed on a night out in which Gascoigne and several others having drinks poured into their mouths whilst sitting in the \"dentist's chair\". The tournament opened with a 1\u20131 draw with Switzerland, during which Gascoigne was substituted. He scored in England\u2019s second game of the tournament, against Scotland (where he was playing at club level at the time). Receiving the ball from Darren Anderton outside the Scotland penalty area, he flicked the ball over Colin Hendry with his left foot and changed direction; Hendry was completely wrong-footed and, as the ball dropped, Gascoigne volleyed it with his right foot past Andy Goram to seal a 2\u20130 victory. The goal was followed by the \"dentist's chair\" celebration referring to the incident before the tournament, where Gascoigne lay on the ground as if he were sitting in the dentist's chair, and teammates sprayed water from Lucozade bottles into his open mouth."]}, {"page": "UEFA Euro 1996", "response": ["The first semi-final, featuring France and Czech Republic, resulted in another 0\u20130 draw and penalties.

The other semi-final was a repeat of the 1990 World Cup semi-final between Germany and England. Alan Shearer headed in after three minutes to give his side the lead, but Stefan Kuntz evened the score less than 15 minutes later, and the score remained 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. In extra time, Paul Gascoigne came very close to scoring a golden goal, but fractionally missed a cross from Shearer in front of the empty goal, Darren Anderton hit the post, and Kuntz had a goal disallowed for pushing.

Platt scored the first England goal in the Venables era in March 1994 against Denmark, and also netted against Greece and Nigeria. However, a series of rivals arrived to displace him in the England team. He was not helped by a string of injuries to his left knee that reduced his effectiveness as a tireless midfielder. Players like Steve McManaman and Darren Anderton emerged, and Venables decided to employ Paul Ince and Gascoigne in central midfield by the time Euro 1996 came round. Platt had to settle for a place on the bench. In the warm-up game against Hungary, he scored his 27th and final goal for his country. This made him the second-highest-scoring midfielder in the history of the England team.
