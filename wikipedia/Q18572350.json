In the intervening 60 years more than one private medical school existed in Manchester: the most successful was the Pine Street medical school, not far south of the Infirmary. A faculty of medicine opened in 1873 (at Owens College), and medical degrees were awarded by the Victoria University from 1883. The school was made co-educational in 1899 after a long and contentious debate about whether women could be members of the College at all.Fiddes, Edward (1941) \"Admission of Women to Full University Status\", in: Tylecote, Mabel.

Ida Smedley, Sarah Burstall, Dr Catherine Chisholm, Dr Merry Smith and Miss Coignou were the first to set up BFUW in order to support the progress of women in medicine, academia and public life. Other notable women who were part of BFWG in its early years included Winifred Cullis, Rose Sidgwick and Caroline Spurgeon. Associations were set up across Britain to pursue these aims by lobbying government and by fulfilling the BFUW motto: \"Let us perfect the art of friendship\". During World War I, BFUW compiled a register of university women offering themselves for public service which was used by the Board of Trade.  After the war there was still the need to work for the opening of the professions to women, though a few members gained places in local government, notably Sybil Campbell, Monica Mary Geikie Cobb (the first woman barrister to hold a brief), Margaret Kydd (one of the first women to take silk), and Rose Heilbron. Equal pay was an important focus between the wars, particularly with relation to teaching and the civil service; as was the abolition of the marriage bar for working women. Before and during World War II, BFUW supported refugees from fascism."]}, {"page": "February 1917", "response": ["* The Medical Women's Federation was formed in the United Kingdom to advocate women in the medical profession.
