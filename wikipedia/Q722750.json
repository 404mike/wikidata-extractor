He won his first major championship at the 2013 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club, becoming the first English player to win a major since Nick Faldo in 1996 and the first to win the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Rose won gold at the men's individual tournament. With that victory, Rose joined Hall of Fame members Gary Player, David Graham, Hale Irwin and Bernhard Langer as one of only five golfers to win official tournaments on all six continents on which golf is played. Rose has also twice been runner-up at the Masters Tournament, in 2015 and 2017.\nHe first came to prominence when he pre-qualified as an amateur for the 1998 Open Championship.  There, he holed a dramatic shot from the rough at the final hole to finish in a tie for fourth place. He won the 2007 Order of Merit on the European Tour and was ranked in the World top ten between November 2007 and July 2008. In March 2012, Rose won his first World Golf Championship event at the WGC-Cadillac Championship and as a result, he re-entered the world top 10. After finishing second to Tiger Woods in the 2013 Arnold Palmer Invitational, he rose to a then career-high world ranking of 3rd. After the Open Championship in 2018 he rose to world number 2. Following a loss to Keegan Bradley in a sudden-death playoff in the 2018 BMW Championship, Rose climbed to World Number 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking.
