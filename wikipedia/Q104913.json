Along with the surgeon Patrick Steptoe, and the nurse Jean Purdy, Edwards successfully pioneered conception through IVF, which led to the birth of Louise Brown on 25 July 1978. They founded the first IVF programme for infertile patients and trained other scientists in their techniques. Edwards was the founding editor-in-chief of Human Reproduction in 1986. In 2010, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of in vitro fertilization\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 10", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Robert Edwards, English physiologist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1925)"]}, {"page": "September 27", "response": ["*1925 \u2013 Robert Edwards, English physiologist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "2013", "response": ["* April 10 \u2013 Robert Edwards, British Nobel physiologist (b. 1925)"]}]}}
