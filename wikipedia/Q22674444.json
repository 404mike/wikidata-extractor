Posters issued by the DMP depicted and described the missing jewels. Detective Chief Inspector John Kane of Scotland Yard arrived on 12 July to assist. His report, never released, is said to have named the culprit and to have been suppressed by the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). Vicars refused to resign his position, and similarly refused to appear at a Viceregal Commission under Judge James Johnston Shaw into the theft held from 10 January 1908. Vicars argued for a public Royal Commission instead, which would have had power to subpoena witnesses. He publicly accused his second in command, Francis Shackleton, of the theft. Kane explicitly denied to the Commission that Shackleton, brother of the explorer Ernest Shackleton, was involved. Shackleton was exonerated in the Commission's report, and Vicars was found to have \"not exercise[d] due vigilance or proper care as the custodian of the regalia.\" Vicars was compelled to resign, as were all the staff in his personal employ."]}, {"page": "Robert Woods (surgeon)", "response": ["He attended Wesley College, Dublin and Trinity College, Dublin as well as studying in Vienna, before graduating in medicine in 1889.

As Registrar of the Order of St Patrick, Vicars had custody of the insignia of the order, also known as the \"crown jewels\". They were found to be missing on 6 July, and a Crown Jewel Commission under Judge James Johnston Shaw was established in January 1908 to investigate the disappearance. Vicars and his barrister Tim Healy refused to attend the commission's hearings. The commission's findings were published on 25 January 1908 and Vicars was dismissed as Ulster five days later."]}, {"page": "Whately Chair of Political Economy", "response": ["*1876 James Johnston Shaw"]}]}}
