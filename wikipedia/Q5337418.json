Born in Dunkirk, Kent, in 1881 he entered the Royal Academy of Music where he studied under George Alexander Macfarren. He was organist at a number of London churches, including St Mary's, Kilburn and St James's Church, Piccadilly until his retirement in 1924. Although the composer of a number of anthems and other church music, he is best known for his 1892 book Modern Christmas Carols. Pettman harmonized the now popular carols I Saw a Maiden and Gabriel's Message, both based on Basque carol melodies, publishing the latter in a pamphlet, The University Carol book, in 1922 with an English rendering by Sabine Baring-Gould.  It was Pettman who collected and adapted the 'Normandy folk melody' sung to 'Away in a manger'. He was also an early editor of the works of Thomas Tallis, publishing an edition in 1900.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carols for Choirs", "response": [" ||  Edgar Pettman (arr.)"]}, {"page": "Gabriel's Message", "response": ["A Basque folk carol, originally based on Angelus Ad Virginem, a 13th or 14th Century Latin carol, it was collected by Charles Bordes and then paraphrased into English by Sabine Baring-Gould, who had spent a winter as a boy in the Basque country.
