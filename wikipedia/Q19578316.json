He began his career as an apprentice with Middlesbrough, but never played for them in the league, and after leaving Darlington spent four-and-a-half seasons with Northern Premier League club Boston United.He was a member of the Hartlepool team promoted to the Third Division for the first time in 1967\u201368.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)", "response": ["Clough was quoted as saying \"I'm not equipped to manage successfully without Peter Taylor. I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back.\" The two worked as a pair by complementing each other's strengths, as Clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players, whilst Taylor was more reserved, though he had an ability to spot talented players. Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as \"good cop, bad cop. Cloughie would knock you to the ground, verbally at least, and Pete would pick you up and put you back together.\" As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager, Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor, which caused Taylor to grumble that \"I sometimes wonder why he never says to Bell's whisky, for instance, when they're handing out Manager of the Month awards, 'You'll have to present an extra gallon bottle. There are two of us.\" On a personal level they were very close, and often finished each other's sentences."]}, {"page": "Clifford Wright", "response": ["Clifford or Cliff Wright may refer to:", "* Cliff Wright (illustrator) (born 1963), British artist and illustrator", "* Cliff Wright (fighter) (born 1979), American mixed martial artist", "* Cliff Wright (footballer) (born 1944), English footballer"]}]}}
