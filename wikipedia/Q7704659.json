Lawrence was a right-handed batsman who bowled leg break.  He was born at Waltham Abbey, Essex.\nLawrence started his playing career with Hertfordshire, playing for the county in the Minor Counties Championship from 1929 to 1932, before joining Essex for the 1933 season.  His first-class debut for the county came against the touring West Indians.  Playing a further first-class fixture in 1933, Lawrence would have to wait to 1935 before representing Essex at the highest domestic level, a season in which he played 5 further first-class matches, the last coming against Somerset at the Vista Road Recreation Ground, Clacton-on-Sea.  Somewhat of an inefficient batsman at the first-class level, Lawrence scored just 133 runs in his 7 matches at a batting average of 9.50 and a high score of 39.  Following the Second World War, he played for Berkshire 6 times in the 1947 Minor Counties Championship.He died at Fawley, Berkshire on 7 January 1989.", "link_mentions": {}}}
