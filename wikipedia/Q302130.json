Hughes played mainly at centre back, but was also used at right back or left back, as well as anywhere in midfield. He is renowned for his disciplined defending, having made 455 Premier League appearances without getting sent off, which is the second-most in the history of the league, behind only Ryan Giggs.He began his career with Newcastle United, making his debut in 1997 and playing 279 games for the club across all competitions. He remained with the club until 2005, when he was transferred to Aston Villa for \u00a31 million, and two years later he was signed by his former international manager Lawrie Sanchez to play for Fulham. He spent six-and-a-half seasons at Fulham, reaching the UEFA Europa League final in 2010. After leaving the club in January 2014, he had brief spells in the Championship with Queens Park Rangers and Brighton & Hove Albion, and abroad with Melbourne City FC and Kerala Blasters FC.\nHughes made his full international debut aged 18 in 1998 and has earned 112 caps for Northern Ireland, the third most in the nation's history, behind Steven Davis and goalkeeper Pat Jennings. He captained the national team from 2003 up to international retirement in 2011, but returned to the team the following year and was included in their squad for UEFA Euro 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 8", "response": ["*  1979   \u2013 Aaron Hughes, Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "1979", "response": ["** Aaron Hughes, Northern Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "County Tyrone", "response": ["* Aaron Hughes, captain of the Northern Ireland football team"]}, {"page": "Cookstown", "response": ["* Aaron Hughes - footballer, Northern Ireland Team."]}, {"page": "SuperCupNI", "response": ["* Aaron Hughes (Northern Ireland) 1996, 1997 (U19)"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland national football team", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Aaron Hughes"]}, {"page": "Milan Baro\u0161", "response": ["Baro\u0161 moved to Premiership side Aston Villa for a fee of \u00a36.5 million in August 2005, signing a four-year contract.

He played a crucial role in Villa's League Cup second round victory against Wycombe Wanderers in September. With Villa trailing 3\u20131 at half time, Baro\u0161 scored shortly after the beginning of the second half and won a penalty, which Gareth Barry converted. He also provided the cross for Barry's second goal of the game as Villa scored seven goals in the second half, resulting in a final score of 8\u20133, their biggest win in over 40 years. He set up the first Aston Villa goal in a November match against Sunderland in dubious circumstances; back-heeling the ball, which \"looked to have gone out of play\" to Aaron Hughes. Hughes' pass found Kevin Phillips, who opened the scoring against his old club.

Although typically a centre-back, and often surplus to requirements behind the rarely injured pairing of Aaron Hughes and Brede Hangeland, manager Roy Hodgson brought out a versatility in Baird which made him indispensable for long periods at Fulham, where first he filled in very successfully at right-back when John Paintsil was injured, and then due to the injuries to Dickson Etuhu and Danny Murphy he was often used in a central midfield role during the 2009\u201310 season, returning to right-back when they regained fitness. His success at right-back also earned him a start in the UEFA Europa League against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid ahead of the fit-again Paintsil.
