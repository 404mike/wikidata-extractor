Kehoe had written a series of verses about the principal characters who appear in the 1960s American science fiction television series Star Trek, which were sung in pubs and around campfires, after Sealed Knot battles, to the tune of \"The Music Man\". This version was re-titled \"I Am The Star Trek Man\". Chris Steinhauer performed this version at a folk club one evening in 1986, which is where it was first heard by Grahame Lister, of novelty band The Firm.
