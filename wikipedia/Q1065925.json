The Japanese transferred the civilian internees from Berhala Island to the Batu Lintang camp near Kuching in Sarawak in January 1943. Matthews had gained the trust of the Governor of North Borneo, Robert Smith, who had been interned nearby and, when the civilian internees departed he was placed in effective command of the British North Borneo Constabulary despite being a POW. While he had several opportunities to escape, Matthews decided to remain with his fellow POWs and continue running his covert organisation at great risk to himself. He made plans to rise up against the Japanese if the Allies landed in Borneo, and initiated the building of a radio transmitter."]}, {"page": "Charles Robert Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Smith (colonial administrator)"]}, {"page": "Governor Smith", "response": ["*Robert Smith (colonial administrator) (1887\u20131959), British Governor of North Borneo from 1937 to 1942 and from 1945 to 1946"]}]}}
