He was later influenced by the Arts & Crafts Movement.  He worked in partnership with Harold Rathbone between 1894 and 1897 at the Della Robbia Pottery, and then moved to Marlow Common in Buckinghamshire, where he established the Medmenham Pottery specializing  in  architectural tiles and large wall panels, created from small sections.  The business was financed by Robert William Hudson until 1906 when it changed into the Dressler Tunnel Ovens Ltd, the  Medmenham tile designs continued to be made by J. H. Barratt of Stoke-on-Trent.  Dressler designed an industrial level tunnel kiln for the English pottery industry, for which he was awarded the John Scott Medal of the Franklin Institute.  Later he lived in Paris and the United States. He died at Saint-Br\u00e9vin l'Oc\u00e9an, Loire, France.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Holden", "response": ["For The Law Society he designed (1902\u201304) a simplified neoclassical extension to the existing Lewis Vulliamy-designed building in Chancery Lane with external sculptures by Charles Pibworth and a panelled arts and crafts interior with carving by William Aumonier and friezes by Conrad Dressler.

Fairacres Mansion, also called Ceperley House, for its original owners, was built in 1910 at an estimated cost of C$150,000.00, making it the largest and most expensive house in Burnaby, BC of its time.  It was constructed in the Edwardian Arts and Crafts style with handmade fixtures, carpentry and tiled fireplaces. The grounds included horse stables, an aviary, gazebo and pergola, lagoons, strawberry fields, greenhouses, a steam plant and a gardener's cottage.  The tiles throughout the house were imported from England, fabricated by Conrad Dressler and his Medmenham Pottery. In the former billiards room and parlour, a grand oak mantelpiece, hand-carved by George Selkirk Gibson, bears a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: \"The ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it.\" On the death of the original owner, Grace Ceperley, the house was sold to a series of private owners. In 1939, it was acquired by Benedictine monks, and became an Abbey in 1953. The Order vacated the house in 1954 when it moved to Westminster Abbey (British Columbia) in Mission. After the Benedictines sold the property, it was used by the Canadian Temple of More Abundant Life and as a fraternity house for Simon Fraser University's Delta Upsilon Fraternity.  In 1966, the Burnaby Art Society, led by Jack Hardman, Sheila Kincaid and Winifred Denny, among others, worked with the City of Burnaby to purchase the  site for C$166,000.00. The Burnaby Art Gallery opened its doors in June 1967."]}, {"page": "Glebe Place", "response": ["* Conrad Dressler. Also kept studios at No.45 Cedar Studios"]}]}}
