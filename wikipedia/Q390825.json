For example, the line \"If I can shoot rabbits/then I can shoot fascists\" is attributed to a remark made by a man to his brother who signed up with the Republican fighters. This was originally quoted in the book Miners Against Fascism by Hywel Francis. Another line, \"I've walked Las Ramblas/but not with real intent\", brings to mind the account in George Orwell's first-hand account of the war, Homage to Catalonia of fighting on the Ramblas. According to Orwell the various factions were seemingly getting nowhere with the fighting and often a sense of camaraderie overriding the vaunted principles each side was supposed to be fighting for.
