Following education at Magdalen College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1872, he studied law. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1878.In 1880 he married Helen Alexandria Melian Durdin, co-heiress of Alexander Durdin of Huntington Castle, County Carlow, Ireland. The couple divided their time between the Irish estate (in 1899 Robertson was High Sheriff of Carlow) and their London home \"The Cedars\", South Hackney. They were well known for their philanthropic works in the Hackney area.In 1892 a general election was called, and Robertson was selected as the Conservative candidate to contest the Hackney South constituency. He failed to unseat the sitting Liberal Member of Parliament and cabinet minister, Sir Charles Russell. Russell was elevated to the House of Lords in 1894, and Robertson was again Conservative candidate at the ensuing by-election. He narrowly failed to win the seat, reducing the Liberal majority to 192 votes.Three years later a general election was held, and Robertson succeeded in taking the seat with a small majority of 319 votes. He was re-elected at the 1900 general election, by the slightly larger margin of 338 votes, but lost his seat in 1906, when a Liberal landslide saw him defeated by over 3,400 votes.\nRobertson retired from politics and devoted himself to his Irish estate while maintaining a London home in Bedford Square. He died at his London residence in July 1916, aged 67.His granddaughter was Olivia Robertson, an author, artist, co-founder and High Priestess of the Fellowship of Isis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fellowship of Isis", "response": ["The FOI was founded at Huntington Castle, Co. Carlow, Ireland at the Vernal equinox of 1976. The three co-founders were Olivia Robertson and her brother, Lawrence Durdin-Robertson (grandchildren of Thomas Herbert Robertson) and Lawrence's wife Pamela. Their aim was to create a fellowship to \"help the Goddess actively in the manifestation of Her divine plan.\" Olivia has described Isis as \"God in female form.\"  The FOI grew out of a \"working group\" created in 1963 called the Huntington Castle Centre for Meditation and Study. This Centre was active in gathering together various occult and theological figures such as Ross Nichols, Josephine and Mohun Lall, and Gerald Gough. The experiences shared within this group, along with the personal spiritual revelations and experiences of the three FOI co-founders led to the eventual founding of the Fellowship of Isis on the Vernal Equinox, 1976. From 1976 until the early 1990s, the group steadily grew."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Herbert Robertson"]}, {"page": "Thomas Robertson", "response": ["*Thomas Herbert Robertson (1849\u20131916), British politician, Conservative MP for Hackney South"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Herbert Robertson"]}, {"page": "Hackney South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Herbert Robertson"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Thomas Herbert Robertson"]}, {"page": "Olivia Robertson", "response": ["Born at St Mary's Hospital in London, Olivia Robertson was descended from the theologian Richard Graves, a cousin of the author Robert Graves,\"An Interview with Olivia Durdin-Robertson\".
