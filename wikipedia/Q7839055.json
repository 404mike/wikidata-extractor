He is a founding partner, chairman and creative director of Beattie McGuinness Bungay (BMB), and was formerly the chairman and creative director of TBWA London. Considered one of the leading figures in advertising in Britain, Beattie has been responsible for a number of high-profile and sometimes controversial advertising campaigns, most notably the \"fcuk\" campaign for French Connection and the 1994 Playtex Wonderbra campaign featuring Eva Herzigov\u00e1. He has managed campaigns for the Labour Party, being a friend of Peter Mandelson and a supporter of New Labour. Beattie masterminded the ad campaigns for the Labour party in the 2001 and 2005 general elections.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eva Herzigov\u00e1", "response": ["After arriving in Paris, her popularity increased. Her first important appearance was as the model for the first Wonderbra campaign. In 1994, advertising executive Trevor Beattie, working for TBWA/London, developed an ad for Sara Lee's \"Hello Boys\" Wonderbra campaign. It featured a close-up image of Herzigov\u00e1 wearing a black Wonderbra. The ad used only two words: \"Hello boys.\" The influential poster was featured in an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and it was voted in at number 10 in a \"Poster of the Century\" contest. The Canada-based lingerie fashion label wanted the ad campaign to motivate women to see the Wonderbra \"as a cosmetic and as a beauty enhancer rather than a functional garment\". The billboard was voted in 2011 as the most iconic outdoor ad during the past five decades by the Outdoor Media Centre. She was also featured in Guess? jeans campaigns, the Victoria's Secret catalog and Sports Illustrated. Herzigov\u00e1 has featured in a variety of international fashion magazines, gracing the covers of Vogue (France, Britain, Spain, Germany, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Poland, Turkey, Thailand), Harper's Bazaar (Britain, Spain, Ukraine, Italy, Australia) as well as Elle, Marie Claire, Num\u00e9ro and Allure.
