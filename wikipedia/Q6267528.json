Coote's durability over the next 9 years saw him claim the club record for consecutive FA Cup appearances (30) and aside from playing on both flanks at full back, he also played in six other outfield positions. After missing the first 9 games of the 1954\u201355 season, Coote missed only 16 of the club's next 378 league games. Ever-increasingly used as a utility man, Coote filled eight different positions during his time at Griffin Park. Attention from First Division clubs Arsenal and West Bromwich Albion came his way, but deals never materialised. At the end of the 1960\u201361 season, Coote was jointly-awarded a testimonial with Johnny Rainford versus an All Star XI for his service to the club."]}, {"page": "Football League Third Division North versus South representative matches", "response": ["| Johnny Rainford"]}, {"page": "Jim Towers", "response": ["Two further seasons followed, with Towers' last at Griffin Park being 1960\u201361. In a bizarre move by the club's hierarchy (in response to the removal of the maximum wage), Towers and Francis were deemed surplus requirements and sold. In 2005, Towers revealed that he was \"almost begged\" to leave Brentford. A potential deal for Towers to return to the Bees during the 1961\u201362 season collapsed. He was given a testimonial in 1986, which he shared with Johnny Rainford (a former teammate who laid on many of the passes for Towers and Francis from which to score) and the pair shared the \u00a31,100 proceeds. Towers is the club's all-time top scorer with 163 goals in 282 games. In a Football League 125th anniversary poll, Towers was voted as the club's greatest ever player.
