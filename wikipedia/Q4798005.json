According to Rodgers, immediately after the exchange of hails, Little Belt fired a shot that tore through Presidents rigging. Rodgers returned fire. Little Belt promptly answered with three guns, and then a whole broadside. Rodgers ordered his gun crews to fire at will; several accurate broadsides heavily damaged Little Belt in return. After five minutes of firing, Presidents crew realized their adversary was much smaller than a frigate and Rodgers ordered a cease fire. However, Little Belt fired again and President answered with more broadsides. After Little Belt became silent, President stood off and waited overnight. At dawn it was obvious that Little Belt was greatly damaged from the fight; Rodgers sent a boat over from President to offer assistance in repairing the damage. Her Captain, Arthur Bingham, acknowledged the damage; declining any help, he sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia.Beach (1986), p. 70. President had one sailor slightly wounded in the exchange, while Little Belt suffered 31 killed or wounded.Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 314\u2013315.Cooper (1856), pp. 236\u2013237."]}, {"page": "John Rodgers (1772\u20131838)", "response": ["Early in 1811, Secretary of the Navy Hamilton had ordered USS President and USS Argus on patrol duty along the Atlantic coast from the Carolinas to New York.

Rodgers offered assistance to Little Belts Captain Arthur Bingham, but he declined and sailed off for Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Little Belts captain, Arthur Bingham, had spotted President one hour earlier. Bingham signaled President asking for identification but received none, but he noticed a blue pennant showing the ship's nationality was American. Bingham continued south, but Rodgers continued his pursuit because he wanted to know the stranger's identity. By 15:30, President was close enough for Rodgers to make out part of the British ship's stern. The angle at which he saw her made her appear larger than she was.
