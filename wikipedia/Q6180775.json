He was famous for his almost legendary feats of daring during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Despite his relatively humble background, he managed to rise from ship's boy to the rank of captain at the age of 34.  This he achieved through notable acts of extraordinary courage and a succession of sea-fights which made him a celebrated hero, almost without equal, and he would later dine with both Nelson and Napoleon. Coghlan's career was initiated by his patron and close friend Sir Edward Pellew, after Pellew witnessed his heroic efforts during the rescue of the survivors of the East Indiaman Dutton.Coghlan's exploits have been described as similar to plots for a collection of Hornblower novels  Coghlan has also been compared to Hornblower because they were both prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of Sir Edward Pellew aboard HMS Indefatigable.\nFrom May 1804 he served in the West Indies, returning as Sir Edward Pellew's flag captain on HMS Caledonia eight years later.Jeremiah Coghlan also holds the distinction of being the only person in the Royal Navy to have been promoted to Lieutenant after only four years service.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crookhaven", "response": ["Jeremiah Coghlan, naval captain in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, \"an officer almost unrivaled in heroic exploits\".
