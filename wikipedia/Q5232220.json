With Cardiff struggling in the Second Division during the 1972\u201373 season, Dwyer became increasingly involved in the first team as Scoular attempted to improve the side's fortunes. On 7 October 1972, Scoular dropped David Carver from the side and handed Dwyer his professional debut against Leyton Orient. Playing as a right-back, he helped the side record a goalless draw, having been reduced to ten men when Alan Foggon had been sent off after 30 minutes. Dwyer remained in the first team for the remainder of the season and was ever present for the side in all competitions following his debut. He made 40 appearances during the season, helping the side narrowly avoid relegation with a 1\u20131 draw against Sunderland in the final match of the campaign. Despite the team's disappointing league form, Dwyer ended the season by winning his first senior trophy as Cardiff defeated Bangor City 5\u20130 in the final of the Welsh Cup."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["* 13 April 2009 \u2013 Burnley \u2013 David Carver and Derek Showers"]}, {"page": "David Carver (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Carver"]}, {"page": "David Carver (athlete)", "response": ["David Carver (born 5 September 1987) is a Mauritian runner who specialises in the marathon.
