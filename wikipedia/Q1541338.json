On 10 February 2010, Forbes had a goal ruled offside against his boyhood club, Rangers, which he described as the \"goal of his dreams\". The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw. In a match against Hibernian Forbes had the chance to equalise from a penalty kick with three minutes left, but it was saved by Graeme Smith, who had conceded the penalty in the first place. After the match, Forbes said he couldn't cope and move on following the missed penalty. Later in the season, under new manager Craig Brown, Forbes form dipped badly after a couple of months coming on as a sub without scoring. During this time he was often played out of position."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Ayr United F.C. season", "response": ["| Graeme Smith"]}, {"page": "Graeme Smith (footballer born 1983)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graeme Smith (footballer, born 1983)"]}, {"page": "Graeme Meldrum Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graeme Smith (footballer, born 1983)"]}]}}
