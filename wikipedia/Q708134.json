He described it as a \"pretty little town\" and noted that the black tents of the Bedouin could be seen along the both banks of the river all the way from Ramadi to Falujah. The modern city was founded in 1869 by Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman Wali (Governor) of Baghdad.

McNeil then proposed a short line from Jaffa to Lydda only, and a macadam road from there to Jerusalem (which would cost only 150 pounds per kilometer).

He first attended the Prague grammar school and then began studying medicine. He studied at the universities of Prague, Vienna, Padua and Trieste. In 1832 he was appointed Dr. Ing. med. doctorate. On a subsequent trip to Italy he met and married Mathilde Pauline Baroness des Granges (c. 1801\u2013 9 July 1881). The couple decided to travel from Trieste through the Middle East towards India. Their \ufb01rst natural history collections were made near Smyrna where Helfer practised medicine. They continued to Aleppo. In Aleppo, Helfer was invited to join Colonel Francis Rawdon Chesney's Euphrates expedition as the expedition's naturalist. The expedition began the journey down the Euphrates on 22 March 1836. The Euphrates expedition continued, but the Helfers left it at Balis in May, after sending two crates of specimens to the British Museum (lost at sea). Parting from Chesney the Helfers traveled from Syria to the Persian Gulf to begin the six-week voyage to Calcutta. They stopped in Baghdad and Bushehr, and then in Muscat (Oman), arriving in Calcutta on 20 August 1836 where they stayed with acquaintances of Chesney and later at the Chowringhee Boarding House. Helfer collected plants and lectured on natural history to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. John Clark Marshman (1794\u20131877), editor of the weekly newspaper Friend of India encouraged the East India Company which had founded the botanic garden in Calcutta in 1787 to employ  Helfer as a naturalist. During this time, he kept in contact with the German geographer Carl Ritter, who used the information provided by helpers for his volumes 10 and 11 of his geography. Helfer explored the Tenasserim  provinces and the Mergui Archipelago (now in Burma) on behalf of Company. The Helfers left Calcutta on 21 January 1837 aboard the Elizabeth and travelled down the River Hooghly and across the Bay of Bengal to Moulmein. From this base he wrote a series of detailed reports on his observations on mining and forestry.  Sometime during 1837, the Helfers started a plantation near Myeik focusing on palm trees, coffee and nutmegs and in 1837 and 1838 he sailed the shores of India and Burma. On 30 January 1840 Helfer was struck by a native arrow during a last trip to the Andaman Islands. His body was never recovered. Following Helfer's death, his widow gave her husband's collections to the Bohemian Museum (55,249 natural history specimens, representing 47,833 beetles belonging to 1,700 species, 609 bird skins, 14 mammal skins, 508 Lepidoptera and 6,086 herbarium specimens or collections, representing at least 574 species). In 1844, Pauline Helfer married  Count Joseph Dittmar von Nostitz-Rokitnitz (1794\u20131871). In 1873 and 1877, she published two volumes recounting their travels and adventures in the Middle East and Indo-Burma."]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Chesney\"|Francis Rawdon Chesney, explorer"]}]}}
