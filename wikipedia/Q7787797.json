He was a very successful right arm bowler, believed to have been fast underarm.\nAccording to Scores and Biographies, Boxall was about 5 ft 5in tall, strong and muscular.  He may have been born at Ripley, Surrey but this is uncertain, especially as he played mainly for Kent.  He was employed for a long time by the Kent patron Stephen Amherst.  Amherst constructed an indoor practice area in a barn so that Boxall could bowl to him during the winter (the Walker brothers of Hambledon also did this at their farm).\nThomas Boxall made his known debut in the 1789 season and had 96 known appearances in major matches from 1789 to 1803.\nNear the end of his career, in 1801, Boxall published the earliest known instructional book on cricket called Rules and Instructions for Playing at the Game of Cricket. He died on 19 July 1813 in Kent", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Harris (English cricketer)", "response": ["Like Thomas Boxall and the brothers Tom and Harry Walker, Harris used to practice his bowling in a barn during the winter.Pycroft, p.51 & 75."]}, {"page": "Stephen Amherst", "response": ["A useful batsman and a patron of the game in his native Kent, Amherst made 31 known first-class appearances from his debut in 1783 until 1795,Stephen Amherst, CricketArchive.
