He served from 1982 to his ill-health retirement in 2013. He rose through the ranks to be confirmed in the post of Chief Officer, reporting to the then Chief Constable Sir John Murphy, on 1 January 2011.During his time in office he led the reviews into the Metropolitan Police and Garda Siochana use of officers and supported the Australian Police in its similar review. Consistently praised for his work on strategic development by both the Home Office and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, he was frequently consulted by other UK forces.\nSince leaving office Burgess-Joyce entered local politics, being elected Conservative councillor for the Greasby, Frankby and Irby ward in 2015 and 2019. In 2016 he stood for Police and Crime Commissioner but came second.\nNo stranger to controversy he once compared the rhetoric of David Lammy MP to causing as much damage to community cohesion as the KKK. Something he later accepted was wrong and which he unreservedly apologised for.\nHe is known for his strong views which seem designed to provoke the Left and has no compulsion or plans to desist. He stated that those teachers who failed to attend school following lockdown should be sacked; something President Reagan did with the US air-traffic controllers. His view that teacher's lack of attendance at work once lockdown was over causes 60 parents to have to change their work plans.\nHe strongly believes in equality of opportunity rather than outcome, the monarchy, and was a firm supporter of Brexit. \nA fan of President Trump, Burgess-Joyce has praised his style and ability on numerous occasions and has led the conversation on what he believes is a Marxist take-over via such groups as Extinction Rebellion and BLM. \nHaving such strong views has led to an onslaught of social media vitriol against Burgess-Joyce who is very keen to successfully litigate where he feels it necessary. \nPolitical designation: Thatcherite Conservative", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council elections", "response": ["|David Burgess-Joyce", "|David Burgess-Joyce"]}, {"page": "Wirral Council", "response": ["|David Burgess-Joyce"]}, {"page": "2019 Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council election", "response": ["|David Burgess-Joyce", "|David Burgess-Joyce"]}, {"page": "Burgess-Joyce, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Burgess-Joyce"]}, {"page": "2021 Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council election", "response": ["Leader of the Conservative group Ian Lewis resigned on 15 December 2020 citing internal party problems.
