Despite playing at centre back for the game due to an injury sustained by Mark Beevers, Spurr found himself 50 yards out on the left wing and played a give and go with Eti\u00ebnne Esajas, before sliding the ball right footed past Mart Poom from 8 yards."]}, {"page": "David Wheater", "response": ["Bolton finished the season in second place, earning promotion back to the Championship at the first attempt. Wheater was named as Bolton player of the season for the 2016\u201317 season. Wheater, alongside defensive partner Mark Beevers, was also named in the League One Team of the Season and Wheater was also voted PFA Fans' Sky Bet League One Player of the Season."]}, {"page": "Richard Hinds", "response": ["In only the second game of the 2008\u201309 season, a 1\u20134 defeat away at Wolverhampton Wanderers, Hinds suffered a severe fracture of his left leg. The injury looked like keeping him out for the majority of the remaining season but he returned in late February and once again became a regular member of the squad and in mid-march began claiming his place in the centre of the Owls defence at the expense of Mark Beevers. Hinds remained a firm fan favourite at Sheffield Wednesday, as he became one of the shining lights of the team and a rock at the centre of the defence. However, in the 2009\u201310 season he failed to hold down a place in the squad."]}, {"page": "Danny Shittu", "response": ["In the 2013\u201314 season, Shittu continued to remain as the club's captain in the absence of Robinson, who still injured, and started for the first six league matches before dropped for two matches following his performance in a 5\u20131 loss against Derby County on 16 September 2013. But following Mark Beevers\u2019 injury, Shittu returned to the first team as captain on 28 September 2013, in a 2\u20130 win over Leeds United. Shittu then scored his first goal of the season on 2 November 2013, in a 2\u20132 draw against Burnley. However, Shittu was demoted to the substitute in number of matches by the end of 2013 before his return to the first team on 26 December 2013 against Watford was short\u2013lived when he received a red card in early first half, in a 4\u20130. However, towards the end of the season, Shittu was sidelined again that ruled him out for the rest of the season. Nevertheless, Shittu went on to make twenty\u2013three appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Shittu was also awarded the Junior Lions Player of the Year at the end of the season."]}]}}
