In 1964 they were joined by Pete Staples (bass) and Chris Britton (guitar) and became the Troggs. They were signed by Larry Page, manager of the Kinks, in 1965. They recorded on Page's Page One Records, and Page also leased them to CBS for the debut single \"Lost Girl\". Their most famous hit was the single \"Wild Thing\" (written by Chip Taylor) (the song on the B-side of the single depended on the country where it was sold) which, with the help of television exposure on Thank Your Lucky Stars, reached number 2 in the UK (b/w Reg Presley's song \"From Home\") and number 1 in the United States in July 1966. Its combination of a simple heavy guitar riff and flirtatious lyrics helped it to quickly become a garage rock standard.  It was recorded in one complete take (take two) at Olympic Studios in London, with Keith Grant engineering.  Because of a dispute over US distribution rights, \"Wild Thing\" was released (along with the first album of the same name) on two labels: Fontana and Atco. The band's success in the US was also limited by not touring there until 1968.", "The band's original drummer, Ronnie Bond, died on 13 November 1992. In January 2012, Reg Presley retired after being diagnosed with lung cancer. The band carried on with new lead singer Chris Allen. Presley died on 4 February 2013.", "The Troggs are widely seen as a highly influential band whose sound was an inspiration for garage rock and punk rock. Influential American critic Lester Bangs \"called the band the progenitors of punk\", according to NPR.Ulaby, Neda, \"Reg Presley, The Voice Of 'Wild Thing,' Dies\", NPR, 5 February 2013. Retrieved 5 February 2013. For example, the Troggs influenced artists such as Iggy Pop, and the early version of British pop-punk pioneers Buzzcocks featured \"I Can't Control Myself\" in their live repertoire. The Ramones are also among the punk bands who cited the Troggs as an influence. \"I Can't Control Myself\" is perhaps the most enduring favourite of critics; it continues to be championed for its originality and lasting influence by radio hosts such as \"Little\" Steven Van Zandt.", "The Jimi Hendrix Experience famously covered \"Wild Thing\" during their appearance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, introducing it as the British/American joint \"national anthem\", and climaxing with Hendrix burning his guitar. MC5 covered \"I Want You\" at their live shows and recorded the song for the album Kick Out the Jams, although they renamed it \"I Want You Right Now\". In 1990, the first hit for (and first single by) the band Spiritualized was a cover of \"Anyway That You Want Me\". This cover later was used in the movie Me and You and Everyone We Know. In 1991, \"Love Is All Around\" was covered by R.E.M. during live performances and was released later that year as a B-side on their \"Radio Song\" single. They also performed an acoustic version of the song on MTV Unplugged. In 1994, Scottish band Wet Wet Wet's version of \"Love Is All Around\" spent 15 weeks at number one in the UK after its inclusion in Four Weddings and a Funeral. The authorship royalties enabled Reg Presley's 1990s research and publication on extraterrestrials and other paranormal phenomena. In 2012, Norwegian band Ulver covered the song \"66-5-4-3-2-1\" for their covers album Childhood's End. \"Wild Thing\" was covered by an ensemble featuring Queen guitarist Brian May to open the Wildlife Rocks' event at Guildford Cathedral in May 2014.", "An in-studio tape of Reg Presley's running commentary on a recording session, filled with in-fighting and swearing (known as The Troggs Tapes), was widely circulated in the music underground, and was included in the Archaeology box set, as well as the compilation album, The Rhino Brothers Present the World's Worst Records. The group infighting is believed to be the inspiration for a scene in the comedy film This Is Spinal Tap, where the band members are arguing. Some of this dialogue was sampled by the California punk band the Dwarves on their recording of a cover version of the Troggs song \"Strange Movies\".", "* Reg Presley \u2013 lead vocals (1964\u20132012; died 2013)"]}, {"page": "Suzi Quatro", "response": [" Quatro also collaborated with Bronski Beat and members of the Kinks, Eddie and the Hot Rods and Dr. Feelgood on the Mark Cunningham-produced cover version of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", released the following year as the 1986 BBC Children in Need single.

In country areas and Southampton, the older rhotic accent can still be heard amongst some speakers, for example by John Arlott, Lord Denning and Reg Presley.
