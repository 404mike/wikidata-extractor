His paintings often feature a bowler-hatted gentleman 'vandal'.He is credited with being part of the stencil graffiti movement that Robert Del Naja started in the 1980s, which was also an influence on Banksy.\nWalker recreated the graffiti'd streets of New York City for Stanley Kubrick's 1999 film, Eyes Wide Shut. His work was included in a video by The Black Eyed Peas.In 2006 a spray painted work of Walker's titled \"Moona Lisa\" sold for an unexpected \u00a354,000 at Bonhams in London. At a solo exhibition at London's Black Rat Gallery in 2008, \u00a3750,000 worth of art was sold, with dozens of people camping outside the gallery overnight.Walker was a main participant in the 2011 See No Evil event in Bristol, where he painted \"perhaps the most striking piece at the event\",  one of his bowler-hatted gentleman on the side of a tower block in Nelson Street.\nWalker was the first artist-in-residence of the Quin Arts program at the Quin Hotel in New York City. Walker created 15 original pieces on-site for the Quin\u2019s permanent collection during his residency in 2013, shortly following the hotel's opening. In February 2016, Walker revisited the Quin to show both historic images, as well as a new vocabulary of abstraction. This solo exhibit, curated by DK Johnston, presented 25 original works and opened the hotel\u2019s Quin Arts program for the 2016 season. In November 2016, Walker joined a cohort of fellow former Quin Arts artists-in-residence in using a D\u2019Angelico Guitar as their \u201ccanvas,\u201d for an artist salon.

He was inspired by local artists and his work was part of the larger Bristol underground scene with Nick Walker, Inkie and 3D. During this time he met Bristol photographer Steve Lazarides, who began selling Banksy's work, later becoming his agent. By 2000 he had turned to the art of stencilling after realising how much less time it took to complete a work. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number and by employing this technique, he soon became more widely noticed for his art around Bristol and London. He was the goalkeeper for the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team in the 1990s, and toured with the club to Mexico in 2001. Banksy's first known large wall mural was The Mild Mild West painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors' office on Stokes Croft in Bristol.
