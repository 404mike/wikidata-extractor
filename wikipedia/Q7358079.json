While having a quiet career from his debut in 1964 until 1970, he then enjoyed five years of greater success, including scoring over 1,000 runs in the 1975 season, before a rapid decline in 1976 which saw him dropped from the team. He nevertheless enjoyed a successful career, with over 7,000 runs and 241 wickets in first-class cricket. He became headline news in 1971, when a ball hit him on the side of the head while he was fielding in the dangerous \"short leg\" position, causing his heart and breathing to stop.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Garfield Sobers", "response": ["On 31 August 1968, Sobers became the first batsman ever to hit six sixes in a single over of six consecutive balls in first-class cricket. Sobers hit the first four balls cleanly out of the ground but was caught on his fifth attempt by Roger Davis on the boundary at long-off. However, while doing so, Davis fell on his back and landed on the line. Umpire Eddie Phillipson ruled that Davis had carried the ball over the boundary and signalled six. Sobers then smashed the next ball - the sixth ball of the over - clean over the East Terrace of the St. Helen's Cricket Ground. As commentator Wilf Wooller put it: \"And he\u2019s done it! He\u2019s done it! And my goodness, it\u2019s gone ... way down to Swansea!\" Sobers was playing as captain of Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at St. Helen's in Swansea; the unfortunate bowler was Malcolm Nash. This tally of 36 runs in an over broke a 57-year-old record of 34 runs, held by Ted Alletson. The ball was collected from a garden by 11-year-old Richard Lewis; he later gave the ball to Sobers. In 1984\u201385, Indian batsman Ravi Shastri equalled the record by scoring six sixes in an over while playing for Bombay versus Baroda."]}, {"page": "Roger Davis", "response": ["Roger Davis may refer to:", "*Roger Davis (film actor) (1884\u20131980), American actor", "*Roger Davis (television actor) (born 1939), American actor in television series Dark Shadows and Alias Smith and Jones", "*Roger Davis (cricketer) (born 1946), former county cricketer who played for Glamorgan", "*Roger Davis (Pennsylvania politician) (1762\u20131815), member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania", "*Roger Davis (American football) (born 1938), former American football player", "*Roger Davis, a character from Rent (musical)", "*Roger Davis, Marengo County, Alabama, Sheriff, imprisoned for corruption"]}, {"page": "Cricket ball", "response": ["Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707\u20131751) is often said to have died of complications after being hit by a cricket ball, although the connection between the incident and his actual cause of death is unproven.

During a match with Glamorgan, Majid blasted a rapid 147 in 89 minutes, hitting Roger Davis for five sixes in one over. Wilf Wooller, the club secretary, had been a close friend of Majid's father when Dr Jahangir Khan had been up at Cambridge, and the influential Glamorgan secretary persuaded Glamorgan county to sign him as the overseas player from 1968. In 1972 he won the Walter Lawrence Trophy for the season\u2019s fastest century which he scored in 70 minutes for Glamorgan against Warwickshire. He captained the Welsh county between 1973 and 1976, scored over 9000 runs punctuated with 21 first-class centuries for them.
