Manfred von Richthofen was promoted out of  squadron command to lead the new wing. Inheriting Richthofen's Jagdstaffel 11 command and leading this squadron as part of the new wing, Wolff downed a RE-8 of No. 4 Squadron RFC and a Sopwith Triplane of No. 1 Naval Squadron in early July for his final victories, the 32nd and 33rd. However, on 11 July Wolff was shot in both his left hand and left shoulder by gunfire from a Sopwith Triplane flown by future ace Flight Sub-Lieutenant Herbert Rowley of No. 1 Naval Squadron. Wolff crash landed his aircraft on the Courtrai railway line. The crash ripped off the undercarriage and flipped the aircraft over. The wreck came to rest with Wolff's head within inches of smashing on a metal fence. His rescuers toted him off to the hospital. Wolff would not return from sick leave until 11 September. The day after his return, he was promoted to oberleutnant (lieutenant)."]}, {"page": "Cyril Ridley", "response": ["Ridley then served with No. 1 Squadron RNAS in northern France, initially flying a Sopwith Triplane.

He had gained a further three victories; driving down Albatros D.Vs on 17 July and 14 August, and a DFW Type C reconnaissance aircraft on 10 September, before being promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 October 1917.
