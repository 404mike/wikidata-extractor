K. and Isabella R. Lyon, of Tantallon Lodge, North Berwick, Scotland, he was one of five brothers, three of whom were killed in the war and one of whom died while a student at Haileybury.\nWalter went to Balliol College, Oxford and began a career as a Scottish Advocate.\nHe volunteered for the 9th Battalion Royal Scots before the First World War and was sent to Belgium in February 1915, to the trenches near Glencose Wood outside Ypres. He served as a lieutenant. Soon after he wrote two poems, Easter at Ypres and Lines Written in a Fire Trench. A few weeks later while the Second Battle of Ypres was at its fiercest, he wrote two more poems, On a Grave in a Trench, which he inscribed \"English killed for Patrie\", and I Tracked a Dead Man Down a Trench.\nIn early May 1915 Walter Lyon and the Royal Scots were in dugouts in Potijze Wood near the Menin Road, just 200 yards from the firing line. The shelling was so fierce that trees were torn up by the roots and the tops sliced by shrapnel. The stream of wounded from the wood was continuous and Walter Lyon was among the dead. He has no known grave and his name is listed on the Menin Gate Memorial in Ypres, panel 11.A collection of his poems was published in 1916 and two are included in an anthology of Public School War Poetry called \"A Deep Cry\" published in 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Menin Gate", "response": ["* Lieutenant Walter Lyon, poet"]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Walter Lyon"]}, {"page": "1915 in poetry", "response": ["* May 8 \u2013 Walter Lyon, Scottish war poet, 28, missing in action"]}, {"page": "Lyon (surname)", "response": ["* Walter Lyon (poet) (1887\u20131915), British war poet", "* Walter Lyon (cricketer) (1841\u20131918), English cricketer", "* Walter Lyon (Pennsylvania politician) (1853\u20131933), US politician"]}, {"page": "1915 in Scotland", "response": ["* 8 May \u2013 Walter Lyon, lawyer and war poet (born 1886; missing in action)"]}, {"page": "1886 in Scotland", "response": ["* 1 October \u2013 Walter Lyon, lawyer and poet (killed in action 1915)"]}, {"page": "Walter Lyon", "response": ["Walter Lyon may refer to:", "*Walter Lyon (poet) (1886\u20131915), war poet", "*Walter Lyon (cricketer) (1841\u20131918), English cricketer", "*Walter Lyon (footballer) (1879\u20131964), Australian footballer", "*Walter Lyon (politician) (1853\u20131933),  Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania"]}]}}
