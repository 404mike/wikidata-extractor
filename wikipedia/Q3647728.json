Durst cited both bands as two of his biggest influences. Faith No More's semi-ironic cover of \"Easy\" by Lionel Richie in 1992 hinted what would be the recording of George Michael's \"Faith\" by Limp Bizkit in 1997. The frontmen of both groups have distanced themselves from Limp Bizkit; Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine stated that Limp Bizkit \"sucks\", while Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton paraphrased the quote attributed to G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen, Er kann mich am Arsch lecken \u2013 \"He can lick my ass\", when asked by a German reporter about Durst's interest in releasing his music through Interscope Records."]}, {"page": "Master of Puppets", "response": ["Master of Puppets features dynamic music and thick arrangements. Metallica delivered a more refined approach and performance compared to the previous two albums, with multilayered songs and technical dexterity. This album and its predecessor Ride the Lightning follow a similar track sequencing: both open with an up-tempo song with an acoustic intro, followed by a lengthy title track, and a fourth track with ballad qualities. Although both albums are similarly structured, the musicianship on Master of Puppets is more powerful and epic in scope, with tight rhythms and delicate guitar solos. According to music writer Joel McIver, Master of Puppets introduced a new level of heaviness and complexity in thrash metal, displaying atmospheric and precisely executed songs. Hetfield's vocals had matured from the hoarse shouting of the first two albums to a deeper, in-control, yet aggressive style. The songs explore themes such as control and the abuse of power. The lyrics describe the consequences of alienation, oppression, and feelings of powerlessness. Author Ryan Moore thought the lyrics depicted \"ominous yet unnamed forces of power wielding total control over helpless human subjects\". The lyrics were considered perceptive and harrowing, and were praised for being honest and socially conscious by writer Brock Helander. Referring to the epic proportions of the songs, BBC Music's Eamonn Stack stated that \"at this stage in their careers Metallica weren't even doing songs, they were telling stories\". The compositions and arrangements benefited from bassist Cliff Burton's classical training and understanding of harmony."]}, {"page": "Ride the Lightning", "response": ["\"Creeping Death\" describes the Plague of the Death of the Firstborn (Exodus 12:29). The lyrics deal with the ten plagues visited on Ancient Egypt; four of them are mentioned throughout the song, as well as the Passover. The title was inspired by a scene from The Ten Commandments while the band was watching the movie at Burton's house. The bridge, with its chant \"Die, by my hand!\", was originally written by Hammett for the song \"Die by His Hand\" while he was playing in Exodus, who recorded it as a demo but did not feature it on a studio album. Journalist Joel McIver called the song a \"moshpit anthem\" due to its epic lyrical themes and dramatic atmosphere. \"Creeping Death\" was released as a single with a B-side titled Garage Days Revisited made up of covers of Diamond Head's \"Am I Evil?\" and Blitzkrieg's \"Blitzkrieg\". \"The Call of Ktulu\", tentatively titled \"When Hell Freezes Over\", was inspired by H.\u00a0P. Lovecraft's book The Shadow over Innsmouth, which was introduced to the rest of the band by Burton. The title was taken from one of Lovecraft's key stories featuring Cthulhu, The Call of Cthulhu, although the original name was modified to \"Ktulu\" for easier pronunciation. The track begins with a D minor chord progression in the intro, written by Mustaine (Mustaine later re-used the chord structure on Megadeth's track \"Hangar 18\") followed by a two-minute bass solo over a rhythmic riff pattern. Conductor Michael Kamen rearranged the piece for Metallica's 1999 S&M project and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2001."]}, {"page": "Megadeth", "response": ["Despite its low-fidelity sound, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was relatively successful in underground metal circles and attracted major-label interest. Music writer Joel McIver praised its \"blistering technicality\" and stated that the album \"raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully\". The front cover marked the debut of band mascot Vic Rattlehead, who regularly appeared on subsequent album artwork."]}, {"page": "Nu metal", "response": ["Joel McIver acknowledged Korn as the band that created and pioneered the nu metal genre with its demo Neidermayer's Mind, which was released in 1993. McIver also acknowledged Korn as the band that started the new wave of American heavy metal, which is a heavy metal music movement that started in the 1990s. The aggressive riffs of Korn, the rapping of Limp Bizkit, and the melodic ballads of Staind created the sonic template for nu metal. The origins of the term \"nu metal\" are often attributed to the work of producer Ross Robinson, who has been called \"The Godfather of Nu Metal\" between producers. Robinson has produced for nu metal bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. Many of the first nu metal bands, such as Korn and Deftones, came from California; however, the genre soon spread across the United States and many bands arose from various states, including Limp Bizkit from Florida, Staind from Massachusetts,  and Slipknot from Iowa. In the book Brave Nu World, Tommy Udo wrote about the nu metal band Coal Chamber, \"There's some evidence to suggest that Coal Chamber were the first band to whom the tag 'nu metal' was actually applied, in a live review in Spin magazine.\""]}, {"page": "Soundgarden", "response": ["Black Sabbath also had a huge impact on the band's sound, especially on the guitar riffsPete Prown, Harvey P.

Along with Metallica's Master of Puppets and Slayer's Reign in Blood, which were also released in 1986, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? is considered pivotal in giving prominence to extreme metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey recognized the record as a notable achievement in the band's history, and called it a \"classic of early thrash\". Similarly, Chad Bowar of About.com said that the album captured Megadeth in their prime, and recommended it as a \"mandatory\" recording for the fans of this genre. Sputnikmusic's Mike Stagno named the album a \"bona-fide masterpiece\" and said it was the main reason why Megadeth became one of the leading acts of the underground scene. Joel McIver, writing in Record Collector, said that the album's main strength was its fluidity, with all songs moving in a continuous, steady stream.

According to Greg Sandow from Entertainment Weekly, Megadeth's \"music has lost its former hurricane verve but keeps its crunch, and feels more rooted, even more melodic\". Chad Bowar from About.com raved the album's 20th anniversary edition, describing the songs as \"more straightforward\" and the lyrics predominantly being \"politically charged\". Jon Hadusek, writing in Consequence of Sound, labeled Countdown to Extinction as Mustaine's \"political record\" and said that the record \"saw Megadeth moving away from thrash metal and closer to generic hard rock, a sonic shift they would embrace on subsequent albums\". In an unfavorable review, Karen Csengeri of Rolling Stone wrote that \"while Countdown echoes the band's earlier work thematically, it's stylistically disappointing\". However, the magazine would later rank the album 33rd on their 2017 \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\" list. By contrast, Holger Stratmann of Rock Hard concluded that the disc is \"a compact album with a few strokes of genius\".

The album is considered crucial in thrash metal's genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Author Joel McIver described Burton's and Hetfield's performances as nearly virtuosic, highlighting Burton's smooth-sounding bass and Hetfield's precise picking skills. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \"naive charm\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s.
