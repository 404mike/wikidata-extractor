In his poem The Prelude, William Wordsworth recounted exploring the ruins of Brougham as an adolescent with his sister. Brougham also provided inspiration for another of Wordsworth's poems, the Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors. The fallen castle attracted sightseers and antiquarians such as William Gilpin and Richard Warner. In his diary, Journey to the Lake District from Cambridge 1779, William Wilberforce described Brougham Castle as a \"very fine ruin\". The painter J. M. W. Turner visited Brougham in 1809 and 1831, and on the first occasion produced a sketch which would be the starting point of a later watercolour. To avoid the castle decaying further, Charles Tufton, 10th Earl of Thanet, spent \u00a341 repairing the structure in 1830, and his successor Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet, undertook further repairs in the late 1840s, costing \u00a3421.", "Brougham Castle is entered through a three-storey double-gatehouse. Originally the coat of arms of Roger Clifford and his wife was carved above the entrance to the gatehouse but in the 19th century this was replaced by the current inscription, \"Thys Made Roger\", by Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet. The inscription was originally above the entrance of the great hall built by Roger Clifford, 5th Baron Clifford. Erected on the slope inclining down to the river, the gatehouse was constructed in the early 14th century by Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. The complex has three components: the inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between. The inner gatehouse survives to a height of  in the east. The ground-floor passage through the building is vaulted and there was a portcullis at the east end. A postern gate was hidden behind a buttress in the north side of the gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving the castle. The floors above the passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to the keep, allowing people to move between the two without having to go outside. In the 17th century Lady Anne Clifford converted the top floor into her bedroom. Like the inner gatehouse, the outer section had a square plan, and the upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room. The building survives to a height of  in the east. Below the outer gatehouse was a dungeon, and at ground floor level on the north side the guardroom. The large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences. Although the very top of the gatehouse no longer survives, it would have been crested by machicolations."]}, {"page": "List of sportsperson-politicians", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Thanet,Lord\"| Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet || Cricket || MP for Rochester (1796\u20131802) and Appleby (1826\u20131832)Member of the House of Lords"]}, {"page": "Henry Tufton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet"]}, {"page": "Henry James Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet"]}, {"page": "Henry James Tufton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet"]}, {"page": "Sackville Tufton, 9th Earl of Thanet", "response": ["Sackville Tufton, 9th Earl of Thanet (30 June 1769 \u2013 January 1825) succeeded to his title in April 1786, following the death of his father Sackville Tufton, 8th Earl of Thanet.
