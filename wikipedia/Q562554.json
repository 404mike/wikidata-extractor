This revision resulted from a discovery outside the area of Luwian settlement, namely the annotations on Urartian pots, written in the Urartian language using the hieroglyphic Luwian script. The sign 100x33px, which had hitherto been read as \u012b was shown to be being used to indicate the sound za, which triggered a chain reaction resulting in an entirely new system of readings. Since that time, research has concentrated on better understanding the relationship between the two different forms of Luwian, in order to gain a clearer understanding of Luwian as a whole."]}, {"page": "List of honorary British knights and dames", "response": ["| Anna Morpurgo Davies || Italy || DBE || 2000 || Arts/Entertainment || "]}, {"page": "Indo-European studies", "response": ["* Anna Morpurgo Davies (1937-2014)"]}, {"page": "Kafkania pebble", "response": ["John G.

Corpus Christi College was reluctant \u2013 partly because of the cost involved at a time when the college's income was affected by an agricultural recession, but also because the fellows of the college feared that they would be outvoted by professors. Although the chair was renamed as the Corpus Christi professorship in 1882 on the basis that provision had been made to endow the chair out of the college's revenues, the college never provided sufficient funds to establish a full endowment for the chair, and its obligation to do so (to the college's relief) was removed in 1925.
