He replaced the deceased League MP, veteran Young Irelander John Martin. Parnell later sat for the constituency of Cork City, from 1880 until 1891."]}, {"page": "John Mitchel", "response": ["In October 1842, his friend John Martin sent Mitchel the first copy of The Nation produced in Dublin by Charles Gavan Duffy, previously editor of the O'Connellite journal, The Vindicator, in Belfast, and by Thomas Osborne Davis, and John Blake Dillon, both like himself Protestants and graduates of Trinity College. \"I think The Nation will do very well\", he wrote Martin, while at the same time revealing that he knew how the country \"ought to take\" news that an additional 20,000 British troops were to be deployed to Ireland but would not put it on paper for fear of arrest.", "When in May 1846 Mitchel first met Carlyle in a delegation with Duffy in London, he wrote to John Martin describing the Scotsman's presence as \"royal, almost Godlike\", and did so even while acknowledging Carlyle's unbending unionism. Carlyle compared Irish efforts at repeal to those of \"a violent-tempered starved rat, extenuated into frenzy, [to] bar the way of a rhinoceros\".Thomas Carlyle (1843), \"Repeal of the Act of Union\", in Percy Newberry (ed.) Rescued Essays of Thomas Carlyle, London, Leadenhall, 1892, pp. 17-52 In what might have been more galling for Mitchel, Carlyle increasingly was to caricature the Irish in same manner as he did the blacks of the West Indies, former slaves for whom he allowed nothing in extenuation. Like pumpkins in which he describes \"blacks sitting up to the ears\" Carlyle argued that in Ireland the ready potato crop discouraged labour: the Irish \"won't work ... if they have potatoes or other means of existing\".", "The first number of Mitchel's own paper, The United Irishman, appeared on 12 February 1848. The Prospectus announced that as editor Mitchel would be \"aided by Thomas Devin Reilly, John Martin of Loughorne and other competent contributors\" who were likewise convinced that \"Ireland really and truly wants to be freed from English dominion.\" Under the masthead Mitchel ran the words of Wolfe Tone: \"Our independence must be had at all hazards. If the men of property will not support us, they must fall; we can support ourselves by the aid of that numerous and respectable class of the community, the men of no property.\" \u00a0", "Back in New York City on 8 December 1874, Mitchel lectured on \"Ireland Revisited\" at the Cooper Institute, an event organised by the Clan-na-Gael and attended by among other prominent nationalists Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa. While his visit to Ireland was ostensibly private, Mitchel revealed that he had pressed to stand for British Parliament and that it was his intention, if any vacancy should occur, to offer himself as a candidate so that he might \"get the Irish members to put in operation the plan suggested by O\u2019Connell at one time, of declining to attend in Parliament altogether, that is, to try to discredit and explode the fraudulent pretence of representation in the Parliament of Britain\". In the same speech, Mitchel dismissed the Irish Home Rule movement: \"the fact that this Home Rule League [his friend John Martin among them] goes to Parliament and sets it hope therein, puts me in indignation against the Home Rule League \u2026 they are not Home Rulers but Foreign Rulers. Now it is painful for me to say even so much in disparagement of so excellent a body of men as they are \u2026 after a little while they will be bought\".The Irishman, 2 January 1875", "Mitchel died at Dromolane, his parents' house in Newry, on 20 March 1875. His last letter, published on St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 1875, expressed his gratitude to the voters of Tipperary for supporting him in exposing the 'fraudulent' system of Irish representation in Parliament.Freeman\u2019s Journal, 17 March 1875. An election petition had been lodged. Observing that voters in Tipperary had known that Mitchel was ineligible, the courts awarded the seat to Mitchel's Conservative opponent. At Mitchel's funeral in Newry, his friend John Martin collapsed, and died a week later."]}, {"page": "The Nation (Irish newspaper)", "response": ["*Life of John Martin,\tP. A.
