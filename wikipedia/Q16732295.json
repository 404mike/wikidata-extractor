She was elected as a Scottish National Party (SNP) candidate in the 2015 general election but resigned the SNP whip after six months and sat as an independent until the end of the parliamentary session in May 2017.\nPrior to her election, McGarry was a SNP activist and convener of the party's Glasgow Regional Association. McGarry was a co-founder of the Women for Independence group. In November 2015, following allegations of financial misconduct, McGarry withdrew from the SNP party whip while the matter was investigated. In September 2016, McGarry was charged with a number of fraud offences relating to apparent discrepancies in the finances of the SNP Glasgow Regional Association and Women for Independence. On 24 April 2019 she pleaded guilty to two charges of embezzlement, and was subsequently jailed for eighteen months.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Inverkeithing", "response": ["* Natalie McGarry, SNP politician and former Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow East"]}, {"page": "Tricia Marwick", "response": ["Marwick's niece is Natalie McGarry, the former MP for Glasgow East."]}, {"page": "Johann Lamont", "response": ["In October 2013 Lamont faced criticism for her reaction to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery. Ineos, the company that operates the plant, had stated that the refinery was making financial losses, and had proposed a survival plan requiring employees to accept worse employment terms, notably changes in work rules and less generous pensions; this the employees rejected. The company mothballed the plant, threatening to close it if the terms were not accepted. Lamont urged Ineos to withdraw its conditions and for both sides to hold talks, while Salmond tried to negotiate an agreement. Union officials eventually agreed not to call a strike for at least three years, and the plant reopened. The Ineos chairman, Calum MacLean, described Lamont's support for the trade unions during the dispute as \"deeply irresponsible\", while Salmond claimed she had been silent throughout the disagreement. Writing for the Dunfermline Press, Natalie McGarry suggested that while the Labour leader's silence probably had much to do with the continuing Falkirk selection row, ultimately she was \"found wanting\"."]}, {"page": "Margaret Curran", "response": ["At the 2015 general election, she lost her seat to Natalie McGarry of the Scottish National Party.
