He is the only player in the last 15 years (as of 2017) to win 5 county championships and also won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 with England.He was primarily a left-arm fast-medium bowler. Sidebottom played his first Test match in 2001 against Pakistan, but failed to take a wicket and was dropped for six years. In 2007 he was brought back into the side following an injury to Matthew Hoggard and took four wickets in his first innings. He went on to become a prolific bowler for England over the next two years, though injuries saw him lose his place in the Test side in 2009. He retired from international duty on 20 September 2010, after playing 22 Tests for England and winning the 2010 ICC World Twenty20.\nHe took the 37th Test cricket hat-trick in his 11th match for England against New Zealand, becoming the 11th English player to do so, on 8 March 2008, and on 23 March he took his third five-wicket haul in the same series, breaking the previous record for an Englishman in New Zealand.  He is a former pupil of King James's Grammar School, Almondbury, Huddersfield. He has two children, a daughter, Indiana Nell, and a son, Darley Jack with his first wife Kate. He now lives with his second wife Madeleine and her son Louis.
