In 1745, he became joint pastor of a newly established Independent chapel at Groeswen, remaining in the post until his death.He taught himself the rudiments of masonry and at the age of 27 was commissioned to build a bridge over the Taff for \u00a3500 and to maintain it for 7 years. After several attempts he succeeded and went on to build further bridges across south Wales.\nOn his death, he was buried in St Ilan's church in Eglwysilan, where his tomb is a grade II* listed structure.Three of his sons (Thomas, David and Edward)  also became bridge builders, two of whom built Newport bridge in 1801.
