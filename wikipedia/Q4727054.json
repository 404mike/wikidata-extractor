The film's bestselling soundtrack features performances by Jordi Savall, one of the best-known modern viola da gamba players. Among the foremost modern players of the viol are Alison Crum, Vittorio Ghielmi, Susanne Heinrich, Wieland Kuijken, Paolo Pandolfo, Andrea de Carlo, Hille Perl and Jonathan Dunford. Many fine modern viol consorts (ensembles) are also recording and performing, among them the groups Fretwork, the Rose Consort of Viols, Les Voix Humaines, and Phantasm. The Baltimore Consort specializes in Renaissance song (mostly English) with broken consort (including viols)."]}, {"page": "Schola Cantorum Basiliensis", "response": ["* England: lutenist and ensemble leader Anthony Rooley; soprano Evelyn Tubb; viola da gambist Alison Crum"]}, {"page": "Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance", "response": ["* Alison CrumProfessor of Viola da gamba, member of the Rose Consort of Viols"]}, {"page": "Crum (surname)", "response": ["*Alison Crum (born 1949), English viol player"]}]}}
