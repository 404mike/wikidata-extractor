Prior to her death, she had cut off nearly all contact with those who knew her. She resigned from her job in 2001, and moved into a shelter for victims of domestic abuse. Around the same time, she began to reduce contact with friends and family. She died sometime in December 2003. Her remains were discovered on 25 January 2006, with the cause of death believed to be either an asthma attack or complications from a recent peptic ulcer.\nVincent's life and death were the topic of Dreams of a Life, a 2011 docudrama film. The film and Vincent's life inspired musician Steven Wilson's album Hand. Cannot. Erase.. In 2017, poet Joel Sadler-Puckering included a poem about Vincent in his collection, I Know Why the Gay Man Dances. The poem uses details about Vincent that were shared in the Dreams of a Life documentary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scherrie Payne", "response": ["In 1986, Payne joined former Supremes Jean Terrell and briefly, Cindy Birdsong, to form The Former Ladies Of The Supremes or FLOS. When Cindy left to pursue an acting career, Lynda Laurence took her place and they renamed themselves \"Jean, Scherrie, & Lynda of the Supremes\", recording the excellent single \"We're Back', featuring Ali-Ollie Woodson from The Temptations. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, they traveled the world upholding The Supremes' legacy.  When Terrell departed, the group continued with Laurence's sister Sundray Tucker, who like Lynda was a former member of Stevie Wonder's back-up group, Wonder Love, and this lineup worked prolifically with British record producer Steve Weaver, resulting in a catalogue of 40 new recordings, some of them re-recordings of the Supremes' original hits. Payne and Laurence continued to tour under the FLOS name with third new member Freddi Poole, who joined the group in 1996 replacing Sundray Tucker. In 2000, Payne and Laurence backed Diana Ross on the Return To Love Supremes reunion tour, in which Diana allowed each of them to lead one of the classic Supremes songs. The FLOS celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2006 (with Cindy Birdsong, Sundray Tucker and Susaye Greene in the audience), and around this time began using the group name \"Scherrie & Lynda of The Supremes\". In September 2009, Joyce Vincent, formerly of Tony Orlando & Dawn, joined Scherrie and Lynda in the group, replacing Freddi Poole. Then in 2017 Lynda Laurence left the group after 32 years, and was replaced by 1970s Supreme Susaye Greene. The group (now consisting of Payne, Greene, and Vincent) was renamed \"Scherrie & Susaye, Formerly of The Supremes\".", "In August 2001 Payne was invited to perform at the annual prestigious open-air festival Sunset Junction Street Fair in Los Angeles.  She performed a dynamic and versatile set that showcased her talents perfectly, including Supremes' classics such as \"Stoned Love\" and \"My World Is Empty Without You\" in addition to a couple of her own solo hits, \"I'm Not In Love\" and \"Another Life From Now\". She made a return visit to Sunset Junction the following year, performing a similar set. On January 14, 2007, Payne was the special guest star at the \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\" fund-raiser in Los Angeles, California.  She performed her previous hit \"One Night Only\", from the musical Dreamgirls.  Backing her were long-time friends Pam Vincent and Joyce Vincent Wilson, both formerly of Tony Orlando and Dawn. In 2012 Payne (along with longtime producer Rick Gianatos) recorded and released a fresh new version of The Supremes hit \"Let Yourself Go\" along with an accompanying video. In late 2013 Payne lent her vocals to Pattie Brooks single \"I Like The Way You Move.\" And in 2014 she can be seen in the accompanying video as one of the judges.  On July 5, 2014, Ms. Payne, along with Susaye Greene performed at the Sheraton in Los Angeles a concert program based on their album \"Partners\" which was released by Motown in 1979.  They were featured in the magazine Daeida, with a beautiful photo shoot.  The article chronicled career highlights with the Supremes and separately and the re-release of their \"Partners\" album on CD.", "! scope=\"row\"|\"Unconditional Love\"(with Susaye Greene and Joyce Vincent)"]}, {"page": "Dougla people", "response": ["* Joyce Vincent, woman whose death went unnoticed for more than two years as her corpse lay undiscovered in her London bedsit (United Kingdom; Grenadian background)"]}, {"page": "The Mall Wood Green", "response": ["Unusually for a shopping centre, the A105 road runs directly through the complex, allowing many of the stores to have entrances directly onto the street.
