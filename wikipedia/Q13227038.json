The play's authorship is complex; one scholar, Gerald J. Eberle, argued that the comedy displays \"several strata of composition,\" and is \"a revision by Dekker and Middleton of an early play written by Middleton and Dekker.\"Logan and Smith, p. 35. David Lake cites evidence for Middleton and also Dekker, though he suggests a third hand, that of Lording Barry.Lake, pp. 91\u2013108. More recent scholarship suggests that Middleton had no hand in the play and that it was probably penned by Lording Barry.Taylor, et al., pp. 213\u201341. A recent edition of the collected works of Thomas Middleton omits the play, naming Lording Barry as the author.Taylor, G., & Lavagnino, J., p. 19. In 2008, Charles Cathcart argued that the play was in part the work of John Marston.Cathcart, C.", "* Taylor, G., Mulholland, P., & Jackson, M. P.

James Shirley's Hyde Park (1632) is an obvious example, as are Shackerley Marmion's Holland's Leaguer (1631) and Thomas Nabbes's Covent Garden (1633) and Tottenham Court (1634). Several of Brome's other plays, like The Weeding of Covent Garden (c. 1632\u201333) and The New Academy (1636), fall into this category.Theodore Miles, \"Place-Realism in a Group of Caroline Plays,\" Review of English Studies Vol. 18 (1942), pp. 428\u201340.Catherine M. Shaw, Richard Brome, New York, Twayne, 1980. Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair (1614) stood as a precedent, especially pertinent to Brome, Jonson's self-style acolyte \u2013 though other precedents, like The Fair Maid of the Exchange (c. 1602) and Lording Barry's Ram Alley (c. 1607), can also be noted. (Bartholomew Fair, however, was first printed in 1631, an event that may have stimulated the trend of the 1630s.) And later plays, like William Wycherley's Love in a Wood (1671) and Thomas Shadwell's Epsom Wells (1672) and Bury Fair (1689) among other examples, continued the subgenre of \"topographical comedy\".Richard H.

Indeed, the publication of Jonson's play in 1631 may have been important in initiating the Caroline fashion. Marmion was one of the Sons of Ben, self-professed followers of Jonson; and Holland's Leaguer bears resemblances to several Jonson plays, most notably The Alchemist."]}, {"page": "The Antiquary (play)", "response": ["In addition to Moccinigo, Lucretia is courted by the ardent Aurelio \u2014 but she abuses her would-be lover so severely that she converts him into a misogynist. Yet when she learns that Moccinigo plots Aurelio's murder, Lucretia tries to forestall the crime and set things right; she apologises to Aurelio, and he abandons his misogyny as quickly as he adopted it. Aurelio tricks Lucretia into marrying him by trapping her in appearances: he bribes her servant into granting him entry into her apartments, and emerges the next morning to announce that they are married. To save her honour, Lucretia must marry him in fact.
