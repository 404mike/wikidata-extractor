He is the great-great-nephew of Sir Henry Rider Haggard, and the son of Morna Gillespie and the actor, poet, and novelist Stephen Haggard, who died in 1943. Haggard is married to stained glass artist Anna Sklovsky, with whom he has two children, the actress Daisy Haggard, and William Haggard who is an architect. He has four children by his first marriage, Sarah, Claire, Rachel and Philip.\nHaggard began his career as an assistant director at the Royal Court in 1960, then directed at Dundee Rep and Glasgow Citizens before joining the first National Theatre company in 1963 where he co-directed (John Dexter and Bill Gaskill) and assisted Laurence Olivier and Franco Zeffirelli.\nIn 1965, he moved to BBC Television, directing plays for the anthology drama series Thirty-Minute Theatre in the 1960s, later working on the more prestigious anthology shows, Armchair Theatre (for ITV) and Play for Today (for the BBC), as well as  Callan and Public Eye for the commercial network . He directed for a variety of programmes throughout the 1970s, such as The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes, The Love School, Love for Lydia and Play of the Month: The Chester Mystery Plays (1976).\nProbably his best known work is Dennis Potter's BBC drama serial Pennies From Heaven (1978) for which he received a BAFTA Award as its director. The following year he directed the ambitious science-fiction serial Quatermass, a Euston Films production for Thames Television, which was shown on the ITV network. Both of these productions are available on DVD, and the Pennies From Heaven release includes an audio commentary from Haggard (also with series producer Kenith Trodd).\nHis film work includes Wedding Night (1970); the cult classic The Blood on Satan's Claw (1970); the cinema version of Quatermass (1980); Summer Story (1988); The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), Peter Sellers' last film; and Venom (1982). Haggard's audio commentary on Venom is well known for its forthrightness, and some hilarious anecdotes on the competitive antics of stars Oliver Reed and Klaus Kinski. In 1982 he also directed The Ticket of Leave Man at the National Theatre.\nLater television work included Mrs Reinhardt (1986); a number of US TV Specials with stars such as Liza Minnelli, Cheryl Ladd, and Judge Reinholdt; the Gerry Anderson science-fiction series Space Precinct (1994); and various one-off TV dramas such as Eskimo Day (1996), Cold Enough For Snow (1997), and The Hunt (2001). The Canadian prairies-set Conquest (1998) was his last feature film. He directed Academy Award winners Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell in the 2006 mini-series The Shell Seekers.\nHaggard has also had a 40-year parallel career campaigning for directors\u2019 rights. He was president of The Association of Directors and Producers in 1976; he founded and was first chairman of the Directors Guild of Great Britain (DGGB), formed in 1982 at a meeting of over a hundred film, theatre, and television directors at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London. He started the Directors\u2019 and Producers' Rights Society (DPRS, 1987), serving on its board for 20 years, until it transmuted in 2007 into Directors UK, which he still serves as a board member. He was also vice president and chairman of FERA, the Association of European film directors, from 2010 to 2013.\nHaggard was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to film, television, and theatre.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Sellers's last film was The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson. The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors\u2014Richard Quine and John Avildsen\u2014fired before the script had been completed. Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu with his ill-health often causing delays. Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. Tom Shales of The Washington Post described the film as \"an indefensibly inept comedy\", adding that \"it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. \"Manchu\" will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as Tell Me Where It Hurts, The Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda\"."]}, {"page": "H.

But after watching Pennies from Heaven on television one evening, Ross contacted Potter about the prospect of adapting that series for the cinema.On the DVD commentary for the original television serial, director Piers Haggard claims he approached Potter during filming of the series with the suggestion of producing a cinematic version starring the original cast. Potter allegedly responded by telling Haggard \"there's no point \u2013 we've already done it now!\". The film version of Pennies from Heaven was launched at MGM as an 'anti-musical' with Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters in the lead roles. According to Potter, the studio demanded continual rewrites of the script and made significant cuts to the film after initial test screenings. The film was released in 1981 to mixed critical reaction and was a box-office failure.

Rider Haggard, had been directing since the 1960s. Prior to Quatermass, he had directed the acclaimed Dennis Potter drama serial Pennies from Heaven (1978). Commenting on the script, Haggard described it as \"a tremendous re-assertion of the importance of people, ordinary people, and how necessary they are in fighting evil\". Following Quatermass, he directed The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980) and the Disney Channel TV series Return to Treasure Island (1985).", "Quatermass met with a generally unenthusiastic critical response. Sean Day-Lewis wrote, \"Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s\". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass \"far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest\" while The Times found the serial to be \"a so-so affair\". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be \"a bitter reaction by a member of an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the hippy movement with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's the older people who are impervious to the malign alien influence\".Brosnan, The Primal Screen, p. 278.

I was brought in on an off-chance. He [Sellers]'d agreed to do a fairly stock Hollywood comedy thriller, similar to The Pink Panther really, playing a detective and a villain. And he'd fallen out of love with that project and didn\u2019t want to do that script. They said, 'Okay, what do you want to do?' and he said, 'Let me go off and do a bit of rewriting.' So he went off with a Hollywood hack and turned it into a series of Goon Show sketches. The executives were absolutely appalled. They thought, 'Oh my God, we thought he had a picture and now we\u2019ve got a development situation.' I knew one of them, so they said, 'Maybe this guy Haggard could do something with this.' So I got three weeks' work to supervise a rewrite, which we did. We made Peter\u2019s script much more coherent, turned it into something with a bit more of a beginning, middle and end. And they were very pleased with that so I got the gig. But then unfortunately within about two weeks my love affair with Peter Sellers was over but I had to soldier on. I did soldier on but it was no fun, absolutely no fun. Then just towards the end of the shooting he decided, which had been obvious, that either he would go or I would go so they got rid of me. I didn\u2019t have much choice. So I was retired and he directed for the last week or so.
