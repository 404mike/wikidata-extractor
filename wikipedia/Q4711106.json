As an Official War Artist in 1945, he worked in Austria, Greece and Italy. Weight wrote to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, in December 1939 seeking work as a war artist. A number of commissions were discussed and eventually, in March 1942, WAAC purchased one picture from Weight. By then he had been called up and his time for painting was restricted. In July 1942 Weight's painting of a zebra that escaped from London Zoo during an air raid was purchased, but his commanding officer would not release him for further WAAC commissions. It was not until the spring of 1945, after Albert Richards had been killed, that WAAC could offer Weight a full-time post. Weight landed in Naples in March 1945 and travelled to Rome, Perugia, Verona, Florence and reached Ravenna in October that year. During November and December 1945 Weight visited Vienna, Rome and Florence and arrived in Athens in February 1946. In Greece and Italy he depicted the immediate aftermath of the War and the role of the British Army in working to restore civil society after the conflict."]}, {"page": "1919 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 December \u2013 Albert Richards, war artist (died 1945)"]}, {"page": "Richards (surname)", "response": ["*Albert Richards (disambiguation), several people, including:", "**Albert Richards (artist), (1919\u20131945), British war artist"]}, {"page": "British official war artists", "response": ["* Albert Richards, 1919\u20131945"]}, {"page": "War Artists' Advisory Committee", "response": ["The Committee operated by employing artists on full-time contracts, offering short-term commissions to artists on individual subjects and by purchasing finished works offered to it. In total WAAC acquired artworks from some four hundred artists. It also issued permits allowing artists access to otherwise restricted areas and rationed materials. Wartime rationing restricted good quality paper for printmaking and materials for sculpture so such works were under-represented in the WAAC collection. In June 1941, WAAC established a scheme to obtain artworks by artists from Britain's overseas colonies. Although four artists were sent to record the activities of the British Expeditionary Force in France, at the start of the war the majority of WAAC commissions were for subjects on the British home front, but as the conflict progressed twenty-six men were given overseas commissions. Among these were Edward Ardizzone, Henry Carr, and Edward Bawden who each went to the Middle East, Leslie Cole was sent to Malta, France and South-East Asia, Vivian Pitchforth went to Burma, and Anthony Gross went to the Middle East and Burma before joining the Normandy landings. Two women, Mary Kessell and Laura Knight, were also, towards the end of the war, given overseas commissions. Other artists serving overseas but working without a WAAC commission or contract, submitted work which was then purchased by the Committee. These included Doris Zinkeisen and Stella Schmolle serving with the Red Cross and the Auxiliary Territorial Service respectively. Three artists, Thomas Hennell, Eric Ravilious and Albert Richards, were killed during the Second World War whilst working on WAAC commissions.", "* Albert Richards"]}, {"page": "Albert Richards", "response": ["Albert Richards may refer to:", "*Albert Richards (artist) (1919\u20131945), British artist", "*Albert Richards (athlete) (1924\u20132003), New Zealand Olympic runner", "*Albert Richards (footballer) (1903\u20131973), English footballer"]}, {"page": "March 1945", "response": ["*Died: Rupert Downes, 60, and George Alan Vasey, 49, Australian generals (plane crash near Cairns); Albert Richards, 25, British war artist (jeep drove over a landmine)"]}, {"page": "2016 in public domain", "response": ["|Albert Richards"]}]}}
