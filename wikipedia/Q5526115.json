Two months later, on 5 October 2012, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3\u20131 win over Ross County, and in the next game, he contributed 'assists' for Billy McKay and Gary Warren during a 4\u20131 win over Dundee. Doran was highly praised by manager Terry Butcher after the 3\u20130 defeat of Rangers on Halloween 2012, in the 2012\u201313 League Cup quarter-finals. \"If you give Aaron Doran space he'll utilise it, he'll expose teams and expose space, he's a good passer and a good supplier.

In mid-December, Doran announced he wanted to stay at the club and that he hoped Butcher would offer him a new contract. In April, Butcher announced that Doran was close to signing a new contract, along with his colleague, David Raven.

The season began in the best possible way at Kettering Town's new Nene Park ground with Elliot Buchanan putting County into a 1\u20130 lead after only six minutes. However hints of the season-to-come's struggles were evident when Kettering scored twice in the second half to lead 2\u20131. Danny Rose immediately equalised to leave the score 2\u20132 until Kettering were awarded a 90th-minute penalty. This was duly converted and County lost 3\u20132. The first home game against Hayes & Yeading was emphatically won 4\u20130, but thereafter began a run of 10 games without victory that cost Anthony Hudson his job. After draws against Grimsby Town and Ebbsfleet United County suffered five straight defeats including a televised 5\u20130 humiliation away at Mansfield Town that pushed County into the relegation zone. In each of the next three games County were on course for victory but succumbed to late goals. At home to Stockport County for the first time since August 1987 Danny Rose had given the home side a 30th-minute lead only for an 81st-minute equaliser for the visitors to deny Newport a win. In the next home game against Barrow County were 2\u20131 up going into injury time but again fell to a 90th-minute penalty, drawing 2\u20132. Away to Forest Green Rovers County were winning 1\u20130 only for former County player Charlie Griffin to equalise and yet another game was drawn. This was to prove to be Hudson's last game in charge. With a miserable return of only five points from their last ten games and County lying in last-but-one place in the table he was sacked the next day. Assistant manager Lee Harrison took charge for the next game away at Darlington who themselves were in a bad run of form, but County's miserable run continued. Two first half goals for the home side helped them to their first win in seven games with County remaining rooted in the relegation zone four points from safety. Justin Edinburgh was announced as the new manager on 4 October with the job of saving County from relegation. The enormity of the task was revealed in his first game in charge at home to Southport with three first-half goals condemning County to yet another defeat. The next game away to promotion hopefuls Fleetwood Town began with the home side taking the lead within 52 seconds. However a rout was avoided and against all the odds County eventually ran out 4\u20131 winners with Sam Foley scoring a hat-trick. This most unlikely of victories was only the second of 15 games so far in the season. After a 2\u20131 defeat at Tamworth revenge was extracted on Kettering Town in a 3\u20131 home victory with Danny Rose scoring a hat-trick. After a 0\u20130 draw at Wrexham and a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Ebbsfleet United County travelled to Blundell Park to face Grimsby Town. After being 2\u20130 up inside 17 minutes County again fell to late goals, with Serge Makofo scoring in the 79th minute and Anthony Elding converting an 87th-minute penalty. At home against Luton Town County looked on course to get a point from a 0\u20130 draw but yet again were undone by a late goal with Danny Crow scoring in the 2nd minute of stoppage time. In the next game at Woking's Kingfield Stadium County achieved a second 4\u20130 victory over Hayes & Yeading which finally lifted them out of the relegation zone on goal difference. This was followed the first visit of Lincoln City since the Third Division match of March 1986. This match was won 1\u20130 and County leapfrogged City into 18th place in the table. In the next game at home to 23rd-placed Alfreton Town County's record of conceding late goals continued. After leading from an Eliott Buchanan goal in the 4th minute County were 2\u20131 behind by the 28th minute. A Gary Warren equaliser in the 60th minute looked to have achieved a point for County, but an 89th-minute winner gave Alfreton just their second win in 14 games. With the proposed Boxing Day fixture at home to Bath City a victim of the weather the last game of 2011 was the home fixture against high-flying Fleetwood Town. Fleetwood maintained their charge at the top of the table with a 75th-minute winner but County saw out the end of the year outside the relegation zone.", "The opponents for the two-legged semi-final were 1985 FA Trophy winners Wealdstone. In the home leg County took the lead in the 7th minute as a half-clearance from Stones' 'keeper Jonathon North was headed straight at Elliot Buchanan, who chipped the ball back over him into the unguarded net. County's second goal came in the 21st minute: A Gary Warren header from a corner rebounded off the crossbar and Nat Jarvis was quickest to react to head home. Four minutes into the second half and the visitors were back in the game with Richard Jolley making the scoreline 2\u20131. County restored their two-goal advantage though in the 78th minute when Darryl Knights scored having only been on the pitch for three minutes.", "|5||DF||align=\"left\"| Gary Warren||35 (0)||3||7 (1)||0||42 (1)||3", "|CB ||5 || Gary Warren (c)"]}, {"page": "Danny Devine (footballer, born 1992)", "response": ["In March 2013, Devine signed a contract extension, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2014\u201315 season.
