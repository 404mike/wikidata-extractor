Fowler stated in his autobiography: \"I found a sufficient variety of subjects on the island, along with shore and inland, and never went away on any sketching trip.\" Inspired by the Island's bucolic landscape, flora and fauna, Daniel Fowler was considered by his peers as \"one of the fathers of Canadian Art\". The house he lived in during his final years still exists on the north shore of the Island. A plaque commemorates the site."]}, {"page": "Royal Canadian Academy of Arts", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Fowler\"|Daniel Fowler (1810\u20131894)"]}, {"page": "William Nicoll Cresswell", "response": ["Cresswell's paintings are mostly landscape scenes in rural or even wilderness settings, animal scenes, or maritime topics showing primarily coastal scenes from the Atlantic. Especially in the latter, the influence of Stanfield\u2014himself a noted painter of maritime scenery\u2014has been noted by Harper. In time, the hard luminosity of his early paintings developed into a broader, more generalized handling. Like Albert Bierstadt, he depicted a timeless wilderness in which light played a semi-religious role. Daniel Fowler is the first artist in Canada with whom a friendship is recorded and Cresswell probably knew others such as Robert Whale. In Canada, Cresswell began teaching the young Robert Ford Gagen in 1863, and thirteen years later also the then sixteen years old George Agnew Reid."]}, {"page": "Paul Kane", "response": ["As one of the first Canadian painters who could earn a living from his artwork alone, Kane prepared the ground for many later artists. His travels inspired others to similar journeys, and a very direct artistic influence is evident in the case of F. A. Verner, whose mentor Kane became in his later years. According to Harper, the early Lucius O'Brien was also influenced by Kane's work. Kane's 1848 exhibition of his sketches, which included 155 watercolour and 85 oil on paper paintings, helped establish the genre in the minds of the public and cleared the way for artists like William Cresswell or Daniel Fowler, who both were able to make a living from their watercolour paintings."]}, {"page": "Reginald Amherst Fowler", "response": ["The second son of Daniel Fowler and Elizabeth Gale, he was born on Amherst Island and was educated in Kingston.
