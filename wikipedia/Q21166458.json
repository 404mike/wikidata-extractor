The first college for women at the University of Cambridge, Girton, opened in 1873. However, women were only allowed to take exams; it was not until 1948 that they were able to receive degrees.  They were marked and scored separately, however, and the results of female candidates were enunciated in comparison to men's, for instance, \"between the 20th and 21st Optimes.\" Exam results from the 1860s onward suggested that women broadly did as well as men, though with the notable exception of mathematics. At that time, it was commonly thought that women were emotional creatures lacking the mental faculty to master mathematics. Thus it was big news when Philippa Fawcett was ranked \"above the Senior Wranger\" in 1890, scoring thirteen percent higher than the top male that year, Geoffrey Thomas Bennett. She was the first, and last, woman to score the highest on the Tripos."]}, {"page": "Jeff Bennett (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Geoffrey Thomas Bennett, English mathematician"]}, {"page": "Senior Wrangler", "response": ["| 1890 || Geoffrey Thomas Bennett;Philippa Fawcett placed \"Above the Senior Wrangler\" || St John's(Fawcett: Newnham) ||  || Trinity"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Geoffrey Thomas Bennett||07/05/1914||30 June 1868 \u2013 11 October 1943"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1914", "response": ["*Geoffrey Thomas Bennett"]}, {"page": "List of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers", "response": ["*Geoffrey Thomas Bennett"]}, {"page": "1918 New Year Honours (OBE)", "response": ["*Geoffrey Thomas Bennett  Fellow and Mathematical Lecturer, Emmanuel College, Cambridge; Scientific Assistant, Compass Dept., Admiralty.
