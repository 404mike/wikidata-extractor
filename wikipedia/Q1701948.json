He attended Methodist College Belfast after winning a scholarship. In his final year at the College he only studied maths as a result of his desire to become an engineer. He received his BSc degree from Queen's University in 1931, and went to St. John's College at Cambridge University, studying for 2 years with J. E. Littlewood, who advised him against getting a doctorate and just to do research.\nHe taught at Queens University Belfast 1933-1937, and was an invited speaker at the 1936 ICM in Oslo on \"Transfinite Superpositions of Absolutely Continuous Functions\"He worked at King's College in London for the years 1937\u20131939 (and again 1945\u20131947), where he met Olga Taussky, a matrix and number theorist (she had also been an invited speaker in Oslo). They were married in 1938. Todd returned to Belfast to teach at Methodist College Belfast 1940-1941. As part of the war effort, he had worked for the British Admiralty 1941-1945. One of Todd's greatest achievements was the preservation of the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in Germany at the end of the war.In 1945 the Todds emigrated to the United States and worked for the National Bureau of Standards. In 1957 they joined the faculty of California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.\nTodd retired from the faculty, and in May, 2001 was honored by a symposium at Caltech in honor of his 90th birthday. He was called Jack Todd by all who knew him.  He died at his home in Pasadena, California on June 21, 2007.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Todd", "response": ["John Todd may refer to:", "*John Todd (British biologist) (born 1958), British biologist working on diabetes mellitus", "*John Todd (businessman) (1927\u20132015), New Zealand businessman", "*John Todd (Virginia soldier) (1750\u20131782), early Virginia official, Kentucky soldier, and great-uncle of Mary Todd Lincoln", "*John Todd (author) (1800\u20131873), American minister and author", "*John Todd (abolitionist) (1818\u20131894), preacher and 'conductor' on the Underground Railroad", "*John Todd (actor) (1876\u20131957), US actor who played Tonto on the Lone Ranger radio series", "*John Todd (RAF officer) (1899\u20131980), British World War I flying ace", "*John Todd (footballer) (born 1938), Australian football player and coach", "*John Todd (Canadian biologist) (born 1939), Canadian biologist working in the field of ecological design", "*John Todd (politician), Canadian politician from the Northwest Territories", "*John Todd (conspiracy theorist) (1949\u20132007), source for fundamentalist Baptist author Jack Chick", "*John Todd (bishop), Anglican bishop in the early 17th century", "*John Todd (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1910s and 1920s"]}, {"page": "Olga Taussky-Todd", "response": ["* Olga Taussky and John Todd, \"Infinite powers of matrices,\" J.
