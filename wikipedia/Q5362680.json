Denby had a sponsor, Lady Mozelle Sassoon, for the flats - R. E. Sassoon House - they had designed as part of a working-class estate around the Pioneer Health Centre in Peckham, London. As pleasant social housing at minimum cost, Sassoon House became his first collaboration with Denby. He worked again with Denby to create Kensal House, in Ladbroke Grove, London, on a disused corner of land belonging to the Gas Light and Coke Company between the Grand Union Canal and the railway. The project, completed in 1937, was for property developer Charles Kearley. Fry opportunistically planned the blocks of flats to curve in front of the site of a disused gasholder which then included a nursery school, and his simple design won the competition for this project. The result was a spacious estate for working-class people with modern shared amenities.Autobiographical Sketches, p.142Maxwell Fry and Kensal House which set new standards for its time. Fry admitted in his Autobiographical Sketches that during their work together his enthusiasm for their work on the project was for some time undistinguishable from his enthusiasm for her, distracted by the \"sad inadequacies\" of his own marriage: but he broke up the relationship because he admitted \"...

This consisted of two club rooms, and a 70-seat theatre. In 1950 plans were made to increase the seating to 100, and for the walls to display murals designed by Marc Chagall. In 1950 Chagall started work on two studies for the projected murals \u2013 'The Dance and the Circus' and 'The Blue Circus'.
