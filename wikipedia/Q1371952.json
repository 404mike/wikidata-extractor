By 1907 he had won thirty-five open competitions in Great Britain and won the English amateur  championships at lightweight and middleweight in 1907 and 1908. Because of his success he selected to represent Great Britain in the 1908 Olympics held in London.On the outbreak of the First World War de Relwyskow returned to Britain from South America where he was on a wrestling tour to enlist in the Army. He served as a gymnastic and bayonet-fighting trainer, and served for a period with the  Australian infantry. In France he trained soldiers in the use of unarmed combat. In October 1918 de Relwyskow was based at Aldershot as a Royal Army Physical Training Corps instructor in the Army system of wrestling, a system he created. In 1924 he was appointed trainer to the British Olympic Games team in the 1924 Olympics held in Paris.He enlisted again at the start of World War II and served as an instructor in Unarmed Combat and Silent Killing with the Special Operations Executive (SOE). After serving for a period as an Instructor to the SOE School in Canada - the Special Training School (STS) 103 (which was also known as \"Camp X\"), de Relwyskow returned to Britain before being sent to the Far East.\nRelwyskow died at his Leeds home in 1942. He left a wife, Clara, and sons Douglas and George. Douglas was a professional wrestling referee, whose own son, also called Douglas (grandson of the original George), became a regular face on televised professional wrestling in the UK under the name Barry Douglas. The younger George de Relwyskow pursued a career in professional wrestling  cut short by an injury in  World War II.  He later became a successful wrestling promoter and member of Joint Promotions and the promotional business was continued after his death in 1980 by his daughter Ann.George de Relwyskow was the youngest winner of an Olympic gold medal for wrestling, a record that was to stand for almost seventy years until the 20-year-old Soviet Suren Nalbandyan won the Greco-Roman lightweight title in 1976.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Scotland was represented as part of Joint Promotions by Relwyskow Promotions, run by the family of George de Relwyskow. Relwyskow Promotions was not included in the buyouts of Joint Promotions in the 1960s-1980s and remained under its original management while continuing to receive a proportion of Joint Promotions' TV coverage. It remained active until the retirement of Ann Relwyskow in the 1990s. In 1989 and again in 1991, television tapings were held in Scotland and matches screened on Grampian Television and STV. During the 1960s, World Lightweight champion George Kidd was a successful television broadcaster, hosting his own chat show in Scotland's ITV regions."]}, {"page": "Whipper Billy Watson", "response": ["In 1936, wrestling as Bill Potts, Watson appeared on cards at British Consols Stadium in Toronto that were advertised as amateur wrestling shows. In June of that year, he went on a tour of the United Kingdom along with fellow Toronto wrestlers Tommy Nelson, Al Korman, and Ken \"Tiger\" Tasker and their manager, Harry Joyce. English wrestling often involved hard-nosed shooting and he was sidelined for six months with a fractured shoulder and numerous broken ribs. It was on this tour that William Potts became Billy Watson. Booked by former Olympic Gold Medalist George de Relwyskow, Watson traveled through England and Ireland. The change of surname was caused by the opportunity to take on the tour engagements of fellow Canadian wrestler, Winnett Wallingford Watson, whose ship had been delayed by bad weather in the Atlantic; the original Watson later changed his ring name to Pat Flanagan. Watson received the \"Whipper\" nickname from his usage of the \"Irish Whip\", which involved hurling an opponent into the ropes before throwing him over his back, though sources differ on whether the name was acquired in Canada or the United Kingdom.
