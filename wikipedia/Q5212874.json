It also quotes from the earlier club hit \"Devotion\" by Ten City. Although Freedom and singer Sharon Dee Clarke were the featured artists on this track when it was released in the United Kingdom and other territories (even though Freedom was the only one to get his name credited), they were listed as uncredited in the US single version up until the act's full-length CD, Changing Cabins, was released Stateside in the autumn of 1991. ", "AllMusic editor Stewart Mason described the song as a \"terrific dance club staple\" and noted further that singer Sharon Dee Clarke has a \"soulful, expressive voice\", and writer/programmer Damon Rochefort gives the whole thing a \"perky, bouncy feel\". David Taylor-Wilson from Bay Area Reporter said it is \"extremely enticing\", complimenting Clarke's vocals as \"superb\". American magazine Billboard stated that the song recently topped dance charts \"thanks to Sharon Dee Clark's belting vocals and Damon Rochefort's savvy beat and melody construction.\" Larry Flick complimented its \"contagious melody, a slammin' groove, and a well-timed trade-off between rapid male rapping and diva-styled femme singing.\" James Hamilton from Music Week's RM Dance Update deemed it a \"catchily honking political lurcher\". Pop Rescue wrote that \"its audience cheers as Sharon declares that she wants 'to give you devotion' before that familiar bassy synth follows and she lets out that unmistakeable 'heeee-eee-hooo-oooo' piece. Rapper MC Mikee Freedom joins in, in what is a great example of early 1990s chart rap \u2013 somewhat slower and devoid of the sexual violence that you'd expect in most rap now.\" Johnny Dee from Smash Hits viewed the track as \"utterlly brill\"."]}, {"page": "Britannia High", "response": ["Britannia High was based on an idea by Strictly Come Dancing choreography judge Arlene Phillips and theatre impresario David Ian, who were both executive producers for the show.
