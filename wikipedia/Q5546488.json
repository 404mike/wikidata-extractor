He therefore on 13 January 1776 entered himself as a gentleman commoner on the books of Trinity College, Cambridge where, as the son of an earl, he was entitled to gain a degree without sitting any examinations. He did however win the English declamation prize for an oration on the \"glorious revolution\" of 1688.Hostettler 1996: 12 At the same time, he was a pupil in the chambers of first Francis Buller and then George Wood.

After an initial attempt to win them which failed, he won the Latin prize in his second year and the English prize in the third.Brightwell (1866) p. 235.
