The German correspondent for the Times of London, Norman Ebbutt, charged that his persistent reports about Nazi militarism were suppressed by his editor Geoffrey Dawson. Historians such as Richard Cockett, William Shirer, and Frank McDonough have confirmed the claim,Gossen, David J. \"Public opinion, Appeasement, and The Times : Manipulating Consent in the 1930s\" M.A. Thesis, History Department, University of British Columbia and also noted the links between The Observer and the pro-appeasement Cliveden Set.Frank McDonough, Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement, and the British Road to War (Manchester University Press,1998), pp. 114\u201319 The results of an October 1938 Gallup poll which showed 86% of the public believed Hitler was lying about his future territorial ambitions was censored from the News Chronicle at the last minute by the publisher, who was loyal to Chamberlain.Lynne Olson, Troublesome Young Men: The Rebels Who Brought Churchill to Power and Helped Save England (Farrar, Straus and Giroux;, 2008), pp. 178\u201379 For the few journalists who were asking challenging questions about appeasement \u2013 primarily members of the foreign press \u2013 Chamberlain often froze them out or intimidated them. When asked at press conferences about Hitler's abuse of Jews and other minority groups, he went so far as to denounce these reports as \"Jewish-Communist propaganda\".Olson, Lynne (2008) Troublesome Young Men: The Rebels Who Brought Churchill to Power and Helped Save England New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux. pp. 120\u201322]", "In the early 1990s a new theory of appeasement, sometimes called \"counter-revisionist\", emerged as historians argued that appeasement was probably the only choice for the British government in the 1930s, but that it was poorly implemented, carried out too late and not enforced strongly enough to constrain Hitler. Appeasement was considered a viable policy, considering the strains that the British Empire faced in recuperating from World War I, and Chamberlain was said to have adopted a policy suitable to Britain's cultural and political needs. Frank McDonough is a leading proponent of this view of appeasement and describes his book Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to WarFrank McDonough, Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War, Manchester University Press, 1998 as a \"post revisionist\" study.See, for example, McDonough, F., Brown, R., and Smith, D., Hitler, Chamberlain and Appeasement, 2002 Appeasement was a crisis management strategy seeking a peaceful settlement of Hitler's grievances. \"Chamberlain's worst error\", says McDonough, \"was to believe that he could march Hitler on the yellow brick road to peace when in reality Hitler was marching very firmly on the road to war.\" He has criticised revisionist historians for concentrating on Chamberlain's motivations rather than how appeasement worked in practice \u2013 as a \"usable policy\" to deal with Hitler. James P. Levy argues against the outright condemnation of appeasement. \"Knowing what Hitler did later,\" he writes, \"the critics of Appeasement condemn the men who tried to keep the peace in the 1930s, men who could not know what would come later. ... The political leaders responsible for Appeasement made many errors. They were not blameless. But what they attempted was logical, rational, and humane.\"James P.
