Following national service in the Royal Army Service Corps after the Second World War, he befriended actor Richard Burton and began appearing in film and television roles. He is known for his lead role in Hell Drivers and supporting role in The Guns of Navarone, and most significantly as producer and lead actor in the acclaimed 1964 film Zulu, in which he portrayed John Chard. \nBaker's performance in the 1959 film Yesterday's Enemy was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actor, and he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for his turn in the BBC serial How Green Was My Valley.
