Later that night James faced a rising star in Chris Andrews; during the match Powers tried to interfere with the match up, only to be disposed off by both men, though this distraction cost Andrews his match against James.", "On the next show in Exeter, Devon one day later, Powers (with his valet Erin Angel) faced Chris Andrews in a singles match. During this match, Erin Angel tried to get involved using her own handbag to hit Andrews, but missed and hit her man Powers instead, Andrews then took the handbag only to get disqualified when the referee saw him hit Powers with it."]}, {"page": "The UK Kid", "response": ["In 2006, Jones began running the Varsity Pro Wrestling (VPW) promotion and School of Excellence, performing throughout England as he trained future British stars Chris Andrews, Rob Holte, Robbie Everest, Sam Andrews and others.

The school runs regular sessions several times per week and features guest trainers such as Bob Holly, Kip James and The Road Dogg several times per year.", "This highly successful event was followed up with a return to the Portsmouth Guildhall in August, an event that began with the UK Kid revealing that he had arranged for a 15-foot steel cage to be provided and challenged Holly to a rematch. Holly declined, saying that he had already beaten the Kid in a TLC match, so felt it would be unfair to prevent others on the roster getting a chance to humble Jones's arrogant alter-ego. Holly backed \"The Devon Powerhouse\" Chris Andrews for the match and offered him support in a backstage interview before the match. In the main event of the show, the UK Kid and Andrews wrestled in the cage for over 20 minutes with Andrews obtaining a large gash on his forehead as a result of the intense action. The resourceful UK Kid eventually managed to fight off Andrews's onslaught long enough to retrieve a roll of electrical tape he had sneaked into the cage before the match, and used it to secure Andrews to the ring ropes. With Andrews immobilised, the UK Kid brought a chair into the ring and began pounding his opponent. Bob Holly, who had defeated Matt Vaughn earlier in the evening and was watching backstage, returned to ringside, entered the cage and snatched the chair away from the UK Kid. A tense moment followed before Holly, to the shock of the audience, began beating the defenceless Andrews. Andy Boy Simmonz, Jason Dunce, Jake McCluskey and a host of VPW officials all attempted to come to Andrews's rescue but were prevented from entering the cage by both Holly and the UK Kid. Eventually the beat-down subsided and Andrews \u2014 now a bloody mess \u2014 was helped backstage and to a local medical facility. ", "In October, on the next VPW Guildhall show, The UK Kid and Holly revealed their \"International Alliance\", explaining that Chris Andrews needed to be put in his place. Andrews brought backup in the form of Billy Gunn's long time tag team partner, The Road Dogg  and they issued challenges to Holly and the UK Kid respectively. Later that night, UK Kid defeated The Road Dogg by pinfall, following interference by Bob Holly. ", "Come February 2010 and the promotion's return to Portsmouth, the evening started badly and just got worse for the UK Kid. During an interview segment, he and Bob Holly belittled teenage sensation \"Mr. Moonsault\" Jake McCluskey, who had just picked up first VPW victory. An impromptu match followed where McCluskey took advantage of the UK Kid's overconfidence, wrapping him up in a small package for his second victory of the night. In the main event of the evening, Holly and the Kid teamed up in a losing effort against Chris Andrews and Billy Gunn.", "The following evening in Basingstoke saw the UK Kid gain a measure of revenge, pinning Billy Gunn in a singles match but later being on the losing team in a six-man tag match between himself, Bob Holly and Rob Holte facing Gunn, Jake McCluskey and Chris Andrews."]}, {"page": "Adam Maxted", "response": ["** BLW Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Chris Andrews"]}, {"page": "Eddie Ryan", "response": ["As champion, Ryan successfully defended the championship against Hardcore Holly at PWP Heroes and Legends 3, as well as wins over Chris Andrews, Danny Jones and Chuck Cyrus.
