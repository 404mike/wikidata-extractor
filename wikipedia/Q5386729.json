In 1989, with other Somerset bowlers injured, Eric Hill's notes for Wisden recorded Jones \"playing in every match in spite of some injuries and occasional trouble with some authorities for his huge enthusiasm to get rid of batsmen\". In all matches in 1989, he took 116 wickets. A hot summer and four-day cricket in 1990 contributed to Jones's average climbing to more than 36 runs per wicket, but he took more than 50 wickets again in first-class cricket.

They continued their one-day success the following season, winning the 1983 NatWest Trophy Final. Injuries to their bowlers meant that Nottinghamshire could not repeat their success from 1981; they finished fourth in the County Championship and fifth in the John Player League.
