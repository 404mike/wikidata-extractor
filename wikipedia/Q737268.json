He founded the abbey of Plouarzel in Brittany and was, from there, called to attend the court of King Childebert I of Paris. On the journey, he established churches at Ergu\u00e9-Armel, Plouharnel and Saint-Armel which remember his name. He remained seven years at the royal court, curing the lame and the blind. The king gave him land at Saint-Armel-des-Bochaux in Ille-et-Vilaine where he founded a second monastery. He then removed himself to the Forest of Teil and is said to have defeated a dragon which was terrorising the area. He died in his monastery around 570. His feast day is 16 August. It has been questioned whether or not Saint Armel could have actually been King Arthur. Some writers have identified Athrwys ap Meurig as a potential historical basis for King Arthur. This identification is found at least as early as Thomas Carte's A General History of England, written in 1747. It was later put forward and popularised by William Owen Pughe in 1803. The theory subsequently gained more popularity during the 19th-century. \nAfter the battle of Camlann, Armel would have retired to his duties as a monk, and achieved his title of Saint.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Armel", "response": ["*Saint Armel, early 6th century Breton holy man"]}, {"page": "Patron saints of places", "response": ["*Plo\u00ebrmel   Saint Armel"]}, {"page": "Category talk:French saints", "response": ["Saint ArmelStub"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British saints", "response": ["Saint ArmelStub"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Ancient Christian denominations", "response": ["Saint ArmelStub"]}, {"page": "Saint-Armel", "response": ["*Saint Armel"]}, {"page": "St. Armel", "response": ["#REDIRECT Saint Armel"]}, {"page": "List of religious figures of Brittany", "response": ["*Saint Armel - dragonslayer; a son of a Hoel; Breton prince of the 6th century."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh saints", "response": ["|Saint Armelor Arthfaelor Armagilus"]}]}}
