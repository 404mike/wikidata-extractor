In December 1920, he announced that he would not contest the 1921 election as a Liberal and had not decided whether he would stand at all, advocating that the non-Labor parties put their differences aside and form a united front; he reaffirmed that he continued to support government policy. In January 1921 it was reported that he would contest for the new \"Progressive Country Party\" \u2013 a short-lived union of the National Party with several former Liberals, but he subsequently denied this and instead recontested for the Liberal Union after all. He was defeated by FSA candidate Frederick McMillan by two votes at the election. He appealed against the result in the Court of Disputed Returns, alleging irregularities in the conduct of the election, but withdrew the petition three months later before it had been heard."]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1933 South Australian state election", "response": ["|Albert (2) ||  bgcolor=lightblue|Malcolm McIntosh*Frederick McMillan || ||  ||  || J.
