He married Penelope Forbes, the niece of Bernard Forbes, 8th Earl of Granard, in 1952. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by George Sitwell, the son of his brother Francis, who died in 2004, and his sister-in-law Susanna Cross. \nDue to Sir Reresby and his brother being \"never in harmony\", he bequeathed Renishaw Hall to his daughter (and only child) Alexandra, Mrs Rick Hayward.He was the nephew of poet and critic Dame Edith Sitwell. During his lifetime, Sitwell wrote a new variation upon the Robin Hood tale, was a partner in a wine business with Bruce Shand, and became known for his support of the arts and the upkeep of Renishaw Hall.He served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grey College, Durham", "response": ["* Sir Reresby Sitwell, 7th Baronet \u2013 Hon.
