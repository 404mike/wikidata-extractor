Kenealy became active in the fight against early feminism, coining the term \"feminism is Masculism.\" As a scientist, she believed sex differences were vital to the continuation of the species and that feminism would lead to abolition of sex differences and dangerous competition between men and women harmful to both women and the long-term viability of the species, an argument she advanced in her book Feminism and Sex-Extinction.", "link_mentions": {}}}
