The club struggled in the bottom half of the Fourth Division for the first half of the decade, however 16-year-old Aidy Mann became the club's youngest player. In 1984\u201385, the lowest ever league attendance was recorded at the County Ground where only 942 people turn up to watch the Cobblers lose 2\u20130 at home to Chester City; this was also the only ever league attendance under 1,000. In the same year, The club managed what seemed like a major coup when they appointed Tony Barton, who had won the European Cup with Aston Villa two years previously, as manager. Barton's only season in charge proved severely disappointing however, as the club were never outside the bottom two, and health problems forced Barton's resignation near the end of that season. Success was achieved under Barton's replacement, Graham Carr, who brought in several players from the non-league in addition to a number of quality league players to finish eighth in his first season in charge. The 1986\u201387 season saw Northampton win the Fourth Division championship, gaining a club record total of 99 points and scoring 103 goals, 29 of them to Richard Hill, who was transferred in the summer to Watford for a club record fee of \u00a3265,000. The club adjusted to life in Division Three quickly and just missed out on a play-off place despite finishing sixth. Important players such as Trevor Morley and Eddie McGoldrick were sold and the team fell back down to Division Four in the 1989\u201390 season."]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Aidy Mann||W||||Northampton||||81||4||Apprentice||May 1984||N/A", "| MF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Aidy Mann", "| March 1987 || W ||  || Aidy Mann ||  Torquay United || End of Season"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Aidy Mann||W||||Northampton||||72||4||Apprentice||May 1984||N/A", "| MF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Aidy Mann"]}, {"page": "Aidy", "response": ["* Aidy Mann (born 1967)"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| MF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Aidy Mann", "| November 1987 || W ||  || Aidy Mann ||  Newport County ||"]}]}}
