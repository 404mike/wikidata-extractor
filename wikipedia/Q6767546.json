Leading geneticist Steve Jones attributed one of the key problems to inbreeding. RSPCA Chief Vet Mark Evans singled out competitive dog showing as responsible for the problem.", "According to the programme, dogs were initially bred for practical functions such as hunting and guarding, but in the middle of the 19th century they became a status symbol and dog breeding became a sport. The function of the dog then became secondary to appearance. RSPCA Chief Vet Mark Evans called the Crufts show \"a parade of mutants\" and \"a freakish, garish beauty pageant that has frankly nothing to do with health and welfare.\" He pointed out that breed standards take no account of temperament and fitness for purpose.", "When told that the Kennel Club was not doing enough, Irving rejected the claim that many breeds were in trouble, and stated that the Kennel Club and its Charitable Trust are doing much to fix the problems in \"some breeds.\" The programme ended with RSPCA Chief Vet Mark Evans calling for a \"complete top-to-bottom review of breed standards and the rules and regulations of dog showing to move it away from its obsession with beauty through to quality of life\".", "In June 2011, the findings of two more complaints were released. After the Ofcom ruling, Pedigree Dogs Exposed was re-edited for sale and broadcast abroad. The two complaints claimed that the film was still misleading and did not comply with the Ofcom ruling. The BBC Editorial Standards Committee ruled that the re-edited script which says \"the ridge predisposes the dogs to a mild form of spina bifida\" was still inaccurate. The Committee stated that RSPCA Chief Vet Mark Evans' description of the ridge as a deformity was an expression of his opinion but that the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club representative should have been given a right to reply to that criticism. With regards to a complaint on the emphasis of culling healthy animals, the committee ruled that, while the film still included the statement that \"it\u2019s still enshrined in the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club\u2019s code of ethics that ridgeless puppies shall be culled.\", the endboard which states that \"Since the broadcast of Pedigree Dogs Exposed, the Kennel Club has introduced many changes...these include...a new Code of Ethics which prohibits healthy dogs being culled for cosmetic reasons.\" satisfied the requirements of the accuracy guidelines. Two other complaints were not upheld."]}, {"page": "Inside Nature's Giants", "response": ["The programme is presented by Mark Evans.
