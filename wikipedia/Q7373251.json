Hinton spent four years at Forest between 1963 and 1967 before Clough signed him for \u00a330,000. Forest had seen Hinton as a fairly uninspiring player and a number of Forest directors were known to have smugly put it about that Derby would, \"soon be asking for their money back\". They were proved wrong when Hinton played 253 times for the Rams over the next 8 years, scoring 63 goals and winning two League Titles. Other Forest to Derby transfers in the late 60s/early 70s saw Terry Hennessey join Derby directly from Forest and Henry Newton  and Frank Wignall make the move after spells with Everton and  Wolves respectively in between. All of these players made telling contributions to Derby's regular triumphs from 1969 to 1975."]}]}}
