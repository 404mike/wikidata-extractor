He was born in Callow End, Worcestershire, and was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford. He played in a trial match for Oxford University but did not appear in any first-class games for the team.\nIn the 1890s, Bromley-Martin was Honorary Secretary of Worcestershire as well as playing for the club in the Minor Counties Championship, a title Worcestershire won (singly or jointly) every year between 1895 and 1898. In 1899 the county was granted first-class status, and Bromley-Martin played nine times for them that year, his best bowling figures (and indeed the best of his first-class career) being the 4-33 he took against Yorkshire in Worcestershire's very first County Championship game.\nBromley-Martin played three games in 1900, one for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), but made no further first-class appearances thereafter. His brother Granville also played for Worcestershire, whilst his nephew Douglas Holland-Martin made two first-class appearances for the Royal Navy in 1928.\nBromley-Martin was commissioned in the Worcestershire Yeomanry in 1891 but resigned his commission in 1897 after being promoted to Lieutenant. He was a Deputy Lieutenant for the county of Worcestershire from 1896. At the outbreak of World War I he returned to the Army with the temporary rank of Major, later confirmed as a substantive rank. After the war he resigned his commission again and retained the rank of Major. He died in Walton, Radnorshire, Wales, at the age of 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bromley (surname)", "response": ["* Eliot Bromley-Martin (1866\u20131946), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1895\u20131914)", "response": ["* Eliot Bromley-Martin (1899\u20131900) : E.
