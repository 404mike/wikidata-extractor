In 1994, when Vernon Pugh QC of Wales was elected Chairman of the IRB, the march towards Olympic recognition began in earnest. Pugh convinced the IRB Council that Olympic membership \u2013 initially as a non-participation sport \u2013 would be beneficial to rugby and offer the IRB member unions membership of their National Olympic Committees.  Many European Federations, such as France, Italy and Romania, had been members of their National Olympic Committees for decades. The demand to get rugby back in the Olympics mounted as more rugby nations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas joined the IRB, because it was a sport seen as providing a realistic medal opportunity for a number of smaller nations."]}, {"page": "Rhiwbina", "response": ["*Keith Rowlands, (1936-2006), rugby player for Wales and the British and Irish Lions, lived in Rhiwbina in retirement and was president of Rhiwbina RFC and in 2004, he became Welsh Rugby Union President."]}, {"page": "Welsh Rugby Union", "response": ["*Keith Rowlands (2004\u20132006(Nov.))"]}, {"page": "Cardiff RFC", "response": ["Australia played against and were defeated by Cardiff for the third time in 1957, 14\u201311 thanks to two great tries from Gordon Wells, after which a reporter from the Sydney Daily Telegraph wrote \"we fell to the world's best rugby union club\", and another unofficial championship title was secured in 1957\u201358, but only second row Bill \"Roddy\" Evans was selected for the Lions in 1959, although he started four of the six Tests.
