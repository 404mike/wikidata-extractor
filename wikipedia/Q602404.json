Wales selected a strong team, with Teddy Morgan and Johnnie Williams on the wings, and captained by talismanic three-quarter Gwyn Nicholls, who had come out of retirement to lead the Welsh. Roos started the match with heavy strapping to protect an injured shoulder,Parry-Jones (1999), pg 188. and several of his team were suffering from coughs and sore throats brought on by the British winter weather. Although the Welsh started at a fast pace, the South Africans soon began to launch their own attacks and the firm surface of the St. Helen's pitch played to the Springbok's strengths. Wales under performed throughout the game, and the Springbok tactic to tightly mark Nicholls and Rhys Gabe at centre prevented the pair's normal open game.Parry-Jones (1999), pg 189. South Africa scored three tries without reply, dominating the game 11\u20130. At the final whistle the South African supporters, assisted by Welsh fans, rushed onto the pitch and carried Roos from the field. Roos later stated that 'he considered it to be the greatest honour of his life to be borne triumphant from the ground by supporters of his beaten opponents'.Billot (1974), pg 42."]}, {"page": "Dave Gallaher", "response": ["The match was preceded by an All Black haka, to which the crowd responded with the Welsh national song \"Land of my Fathers\". Wales had developed tactics to negate the seven-man New Zealand scrum, and removed a man from their scrum to play as a \"rover\", equivalent to Gallaher's wing-forward position. Gallaher was consistently penalised by the Scottish referee, John Dallas, who held that the New Zealander was feeding the ball into the scrum incorrectly. This eventually compelled Gallaher to instruct his team not to contest the scrums, and therefore give Wales possession following each scrum. Bob Deans, playing at wing for New Zealand that day, later said that Dallas had gone \"out to penalise Gallaherthere is no doubt about that\".
