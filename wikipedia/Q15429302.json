Named after economists Orris C. Herfindahl and Albert O. Hirschman, it is an economic concept widely applied in competition law, antitrust2010 Merger Guidelines \u00a7 5.3 and also technology management.Catherine Liston-Hayes, Alan Pilkington, \u201cInventive Concentration: An Analysis of Fuel Cell Patents,\u201d Science and Public Policy, (2004). Vol. 31, No. 1, p.15-25. HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing firm in the industry and then summing the resulting numbers,(sometimes limited to the 50 largest firms), where the market shares are expressed as fractions or points. The result is proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very small firms to a single monopolistic producer. Increases in the Herfindahl index generally indicate a decrease in competition and an increase of market power, whereas decreases indicate the opposite. Alternatively, if whole percentages are used, the index ranges from 0 to 10,000 \"points\".  For example, an index of .25 is the same as 2,500 points."]}, {"page": "Service (economics)", "response": ["* Alan Pilkington, Kah Hin Chai, \"Research Themes, Concepts and Relationships: A study of International Journal of Service Industry Management (1990 to 2005),\" International Journal of Service Industry Management, (2008) Vol. 19, No. 1, pp.\u00a083\u2013110."]}, {"page": "Rover Group", "response": ["On 31 January 1994 BAe sold its 80% stake in the company on to German vehicle manufacturer BMWAlan Pilkington (1996).

It was launched on 19 June 1984, at which time there was still a high demand for small family saloons, with many manufacturers selling this type of car under a different nameplate to similar-sized hatchbacks. For example, Ford was selling the saloon version of the Escort as the Orion, the saloon version of the Volkswagen Golf was called the Jetta, and Vauxhall would soon launch an Astra-based saloon called the Belmont.
