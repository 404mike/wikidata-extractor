Lizzy Clark auditioned for the part after their mother saw an advert on an autism website. Clark was selected to play Poppy, and the role in Dustbin Baby was their first experience of professional acting. Prior to coming out as non-binary, Clark was considered the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition. Clark, who has since campaigned with their mother against characters with conditions such as Asperger syndrome being played by actors without the condition, said \"My Asperger's made some things on the film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't notice anything else.\""]}, {"page": "Don't Play Me, Pay Me", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lizzy Clark"]}]}}
