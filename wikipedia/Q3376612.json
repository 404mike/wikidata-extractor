Stanwyck's husband, Robert Taylor, was serving in the U.S. military in World War II. Although the war in Europe was clearly ending, Stanwyck knew Taylor would not return to the United States for many months. However, another reason Stanwyck agreed to do the film is that she was close friends with director Peter Godfrey. They met while Stanwyck starred in the Christmas comedy Christmas in Connecticut in 1945, which Godfrey directed. Stanwyck became close friends with Godfrey and his wife.Madsen, p. 228.", "Modern reviewers tend to be highly critical of the film, but some find redeeming elements in it. Stanwyck biographer Dan Callahan, writing in 2012, called the film a \"dreadful adaptation of a derivative stage thriller\" and far too similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion (1941). He found that Peter Godfrey's direction exhibited \"a whole new level of miscalculation and incompetence\", and had a very low opinion of the acting. Stanwyck, he concluded, was incongruously chipper early in the film, while giving a stilted, distracted performance in the second half. Bogart was \"embarrassing\" with his over-acted insanity, Nigel Bruce turned in a similarly hammy performance, and Ann Carter's adult-sounding dialogue was delivered with \"lugubrious\" slowness. Stanwyck biographer Axel Madsen's 2001 assessment of the film was similarly poor. He believed that Godfrey indulged Bogart as a director, \"letting [him] mug outrageously\". He thought both Bogart and Stanwyck were miscast and felt the script undermined any suspense in the plot by repeatedly alluding to Bogart's madness. Film reviewer Barry Monush felt the script gave Alexis Smith so little to do that casting her hardly seemed worth it.Monush, p. 689. Film biographer David Quinlan, writing in 1983, concluded that the film's fundamental flaws extended from Godfrey's shortcomings as a director and the miscasting of Bogart as an insane wife-killer.", "Category:Films directed by Peter Godfrey"]}, {"page": "Christmas in Connecticut", "response": ["Christmas in Connecticut is a 1945 American Christmas romantic comedy film about an unmarried city magazine writer who pretends to be a farm wife and mother and then falls in love with a returning war hero.
