Both Upson and Burn's performances were recognised with places in the League One Team of the Week. On 5 February, Yeovil were due to play their rearranged fixture against Oldham Athletic but the game was postponed for a second time this time due because of snow. The following Saturday, Yeovil visited Coventry City searching for their sixth consecutive league victory and this was achieved thanks to a goal in first half injury time from in-form Irish striker Paddy Madden. This sound defensive display led to Dan Burn being included in the Team of the Week for the second consecutive week. On 12 February, Yeovil matched their club record for consecutive wins in the Football League with their seventh consecutive victory after coming from behind against Preston North End. The Glovers were trailing to Chris Beardsley's goal at half time, but scored three second-half goals without reply from Hayter, Nathan Ralph and top scorer Paddy Madden with his ninth goal in just six appearances. Yeovil extended their winning run to eight league games with a 3\u20130 victory over Scunthorpe United, courtesy of goals from Byron Webster, James Hayter and Paddy Madden as Yeovil move up to third place in the League One table. Both Webster and Madden's performances were recognised with places in the League One Team of the Week. The club's record Football League winning run was ended with a 1\u20131 draw away at Doncaster Rovers, despite an early Madden goal. With Paddy Madden scoring in his eighth consecutive league game he broke a 50-year-old club record previously held by Dennis Coughlin, but the club's nine game unbeaten run came to an abrupt end with a 2\u20130 defeat against relegation threatened Colchester United. On 28 February, Burnley striker Wes Fletcher joined the club on a one-month loan deal to provide attacking cover at the club. The club finished the month in sixth place in the league table, and a record of four wins, one draw and one defeat was enough for Gary Johnson to be nominated for Manager of the Month but was beaten by Hartlepool United's John Hughes, and Paddy Madden's five goals in six games was enough for a nomination for the Player of the Month award but lost out to fellow Hartlepool player Peter Hartley."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 York City F.C. season", "response": ["Ahead of the new season, York released Bullock, Challinor, Doig, Everson, Kerr, McDaid, McLaughlin, Potts, Jamie Reed and Walker, while Blair left to sign for Fleetwood.
