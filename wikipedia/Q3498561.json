The restaurant became quite popular, especially among Romanian Jews and young writers, and was soon expanded into the adjoining cellar to make room for the growing clientele. There, Moskowitz played his instrument, often sharing the stage with top violinists and pianists. Stephen Graham, a British writer who spent time in New York in the 1920s, wrote an account of a night he spent in Little Rumania. He said that earlier in the evening, Moskowitz circulated among the guests while a singer and pianist performed Yiddish and American numbers. Then, when the place was full, Moskowitz got on stage and performed various European folk numbers (Romanian, Hungarian, Russian, French) as well as some light classical music by Tchaikovsky and Brahms. It was only much later in the night that he would play dance tunes which were danced by a group of Jewish men.", "Moskowitz and his restaurant appeared in a number of memoirs and novels in his time, including New York Nights (1927) by Stephen Graham, Jews without Money (1930) by Mike Gold, Dust of New York (1919) by his childhood friend Konrad Bercovici, and  (1963) by Chaver-Paver (Gershon Aynbinder)."]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Redonda", "response": ["A stellar legion of Redondan peers, largely writers, date back to the Shiel and Gawsworth eras.
