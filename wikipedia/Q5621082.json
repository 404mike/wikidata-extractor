He scored five minutes after coming on, netting the final goal and reducing the deficit in a 3\u20132 defeat to Halifax Town at The Shay. He was handed his first start on 21 February for Dover's home game with Southport. He scored in the 73rd minute of the 2\u20132 draw with a close-range finish. Holman had the ball in the back of the net when playing his previous loan club Aldershot on 3 March, only for it to be ruled offside. Following his good start to life with Dover, Holman admitted that he did not know what was going to happen with regards to remaining at Colchester in future, despite having a year remaining on his contract with the U's. Holman scored two goals in six games for Dover."]}, {"page": "Max Clark (footballer)", "response": ["On 30 June 2016, Clark re-signed for Cambridge United on a six-month loan.
