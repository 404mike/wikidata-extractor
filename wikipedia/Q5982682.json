He did not have anything like the success of his Australian namesake, and never made a serious impression on the game.\nAt Second XI level Redpath was sometimes considerably more effective. In May 1985, playing for Essex seconds against Kent II in the Second Eleven Championship, he scored 118 not out, sharing in an unbroken stand of 374 for the second wicket\nwith Alan Lilley (224*).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Redpath", "response": ["My first innings in Test cricket was, as you might expect, a trying experience, but proved to be one of the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join \"Redders\", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. \"Snowy\" concentrated his attack short of a length on \"Redders\" off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at \"Snowy\". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia."]}]}}
