He stated that Murray's conclusions were \"almost totally groundless\" because she ignored the systematic study of the trial accounts provided by Ewen and instead used sources very selectively to argue her point."]}, {"page": "Witchcraft", "response": ["Historians Keith Thomas and his student Alan Macfarlane study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971).Jonathan Barry, \"Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft\" in Jonathan Barry et al. eds., Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief (1996) pp. 1\u201346Alan Macfarlane, Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study (1970). They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Old women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress."]}, {"page": "Theurgy", "response": ["*Keith Thomas: \"Spiritual magic or theurgy was based on the idea that one could reach God in an ascent up the scale of creation made possible by a rigorous course of prayer, fasting and devotional preparation.\"Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971), Penguin, 1973, 320-321."]}, {"page": "Selwyn College, Cambridge", "response": ["Selwyn College hosts an annual lecture named in honour of Ramsay Murray, an alumnus of the college during the 1930s.

Like More, Glanvill believed that the existence of spirits was well documented in the Bible, and that the denial of spirits and demons was the first step towards atheism. Atheism led to rebellion and social chaos and therefore had to be overcome by science and the activities of the learned. Israel cites a letter from More to Glanvill, from 1678 and included in Saducismus Triumphatus, in which he says that followers of Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza use scepticism about \"spirits and angels\" to undermine belief in the Scripture mentioning them."]}, {"page": "1971 in literature", "response": ["*Keith Thomas \u2013 Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in 16th and 17th-century England"]}, {"page": "Pierre Gassendi", "response": ["According to Gabriel Daniel, Gassendi was a little Pyrrhonian in matters of science; but that was no bad thing.Richard Popkin, The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza (1979), p. 104.

This was followed in 2005 with the publication of Emma Wilby's Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits: Shamanistic Visionary Traditions in Early Modern British Witchcraft and Magic, which took a somewhat different attitude to the cunning craft than Hutton and Davies, emphasising the spiritual as opposed to simply practical side to cunning folk's magic."]}, {"page": "Frances Yates", "response": ["With the publication of Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition Yates highlighted the hermeticism within Renaissance culture, and spoke of the interest in mysticism, magic and Gnosticism of Late Antiquity that survived the Middle Ages. Yates suggested that the itinerant Catholic priest Giordano Bruno was executed in 1600 for espousing the Hermetic tradition rather than his affirmation of cosmic eccentricity. Her works drew attention to the role played by magic in early modern science and philosophy, before scholars such as Keith Thomas brought this topic into the historiographical mainstream. Thomas references Yates, alongside Piyo M. Rattansi, for the basic point that hermetic thinking fed into the foundations of modern science, before being dispelled later.Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic (1971), note p. 268.John Michael Krois, Ars Memoriae, Philosophy and Culture: Frances Yates and After, in Glenn Alexander Magee (editor), Philosophy and Culture: Essays in Honor of Donald Phillip Verene (2002);  "]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Keith Thomas"]}]}}
