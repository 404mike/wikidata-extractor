The method was devised by two English statisticians, Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis (not to be confused with former cricketer Tony Lewis), and was formerly known as the Duckworth\u2013Lewis method (D/L). It was introduced in 1997, and adopted officially by the ICC in 1999. After the retirements of Duckworth and Lewis, Professor Steven Stern became the custodian of the method and it was renamed to its current title in November 2014.", "The D/L method was devised by two British statisticians, Frank Duckworth and Tony Lewis, as a result of the outcome of the semi-final in the 1992 World Cup between England and South Africa, where the Most Productive Overs method was used. ", "However, a flaw in how it handled very high first innings scores (350+) became apparent from the 1999 Cricket World Cup match in Bristol between India and Kenya. Tony Lewis noticed that there was an inherent weakness in the formula that would give a noticeable advantage to the side chasing a total in excess of 350. A correction was built into the formula and the software, but was not fully adopted until 2004. One-day matches were achieving significantly higher scores than in previous decades, affecting the historical relationship between resources and runs. The second version uses more sophisticated statistical modelling, but does not use a single table of resource percentages. Instead, the percentages also vary with score, so a computer is required. Therefore, it loses some of the previous advantages of transparency and simplicity.", "The original version was named the Standard Edition, and the new version was named the Professional Edition. Tony Lewis said, \"We were then [at the time of the 2003 World Cup Final] using what is now known as the Standard Edition. ... Australia got 359 and that showed up the flaws and straight away the next edition was introduced which handled high scores much better. The par score for India is likely to be much higher now.\"", "*Frank Duckworth & Tony Lewis D/L method: answers to frequently asked questions ESPN Cricinfo, December 2008", "*Papers of Tony Lewis, statistician, relating to the Duckworth-Lewis scoring method for one-day cricket matches Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick, 1992-2009"]}, {"page": "Anthony Lewis (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Tony Lewis (born 1938), Welsh cricketer and cricket commentator", "*Tony Lewis (mathematician) (1942\u20132020), British cricket statistician", "*Tony Lewis (musician) (1957\u20132020), English singer-songwriter and former vocalist and bassist for the Outfield", "*Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom), a character from The 10th Kingdom"]}, {"page": "Anthony John Lewis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Lewis (mathematician)"]}, {"page": "Steven Stern", "response": ["Steven Stern is a Professor of Data Science at the Bond Business School, Bond University, Gold Coast, Australia.
