There were no more records until an expedition rediscovered it in 1998. The bird is now known to be common in forest, forest edge and woodland patches above 1200 m. Logging of the forest is a potential threat but it appears to survive well in degraded and fragmented habitat."]}, {"page": "Vincent's bush squirrel", "response": ["Vincent's bush squirrel (Paraxerus vincenti) is a species of rodent in the family Sciuridae, named in honour of Jack Vincent.

It became notable in ornithological circles for the expedition by Hubert Lynes and Jack Vincent in 1931/1932. Due to the Mozambican Civil War and poor road access, it was not until 1998 when a South African team of ornithologists were able to explore the forests of Mount Namuli.", "* Jack Vincent: The Namuli Mountains, Portuguese East Africa In: The Geographical Journal, Vol. 81, No. 4 (Apr., 1933), p.\u00a0314-327"]}]}}
