He meant that Alexander Cunningham, Peter Hill, Robert Ainslie and others in Burns's circle, while respectable, were not of the literati. Ainslie, training to be a lawyer, became a close friend of both Cunningham and Burns; a common enjoyment of wine, women and Burns's songs, together with membership of the Freemasons and the Crochallan Fencibles drew Burns and Ainslie into each other's company in January 1787, and a long friendship was established. As a student Ainslie lived at No.6, St James's Square in Edinburgh and his near neighbours were George Thomson the music publisher, the artist John Beugo, the engraver and Alexander Nasmyth the painter, all of whom were more or less closely associated with Burns's career. Ainslie was 21, seven years younger than Burns, when they met. He is listed as a subscriber to two copies in Burns's Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect of 1787. "]}]}}
