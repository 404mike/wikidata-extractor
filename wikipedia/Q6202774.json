He was once on the books as a trainee at Leicester City. He enjoyed spells with a variety of non-League teams, including Bishop's Stortford in the Conference South. He was released by Macclesfield Town at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, and signed with Barnet in August on a short-term deal. After some impressive performances he signed a two-year deal in September, linking up with his cousin Albert Jarrett. He scored his first goal, a free kick, for Barnet in a 3\u20131 away win against Northampton Town on 4 September 2009. Deen was due to sign for Dover Athletic on loan in March 2010 but this deal was called off as the Bees already had Daniel Leach and Joe Tabiri on loan at Dover, and a third would have breached league rules.Deen move to Dover not a done deal Deen was released by Barnet at the end of the 2009\u201310 season."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["| November 2009 || MF ||  || Joe Tabiri || Havant & Waterlooville || December 2009 || ", "| 5 February 2010 || MF ||  || Joe Tabiri || Havant & Waterlooville || March 2010 || ", "| March 2010 || MF ||  || Joe Tabiri || Dover Athletic ||  ||"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["| Joe Tabiri"]}]}}
