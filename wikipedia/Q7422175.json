She has documented the 24 Hour Party People era and edited several collections of chemical fiction, including Disco Biscuits in 1997.\nShe has written about the Manchester music scene for New Musical Express, and formerly contributed a weekly column in the Manchester Evening News. At the same time, she ran her own indie record label and public relations company, and wrote And God Created Manchester, a book about Manchester's music scene. Champion then became involved in London's electronic music world and travelled to Berlin, Chicago, and Tokyo writing about club culture for music publications including Trance Europe Express, MixMag and Melody Maker.\nIn the 1990s, Champion edited four anthologies of fiction for Sceptre and Penguin which were accompanied by CD releases and club nights. This was followed by Disco 2000 \u2014 a book about pre-millennial paranoia, Shenanigans \u2014 about Ireland after dark, and Fortune Hotel \u2014 a collection of twisted travel stories).\nChampion visited  Bangkok where she worked for Asian pop and travel websites and as a news and business editor for an English language newspaper for two years. In 2004, she was mistaken for the blogging prostitute Belle de Jour.Since then, Champion has been living between San Francisco and Manchester working on various creative projects including for community radio pioneers Radio Regen. In June 2006 she moved back to London. In August 2006 she wrote a cover story for The Observer's Review section about the return of rave culture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neal Stephenson", "response": ["* \"Crunch\" (1997), in Disco 2000 (edited by Sarah Champion, 1998) (\"Crunch\" is a chapter from Cryptonomicon)"]}, {"page": "Cryptonomicon", "response": ["An excerpt from Cryptonomicon was originally published in the short story collection Disco 2000, edited by Sarah Champion and published in 1998. Stephenson's subsequent work, a trio of novels dubbed The Baroque Cycle, provides part of the deep backstory to the characters and events featured in Cryptonomicon. Set in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the novels feature ancestors of several characters in Cryptonomicon, as well as events and objects which affect the action of the later-set book.  The subtext implies the existence of secret societies or conspiracies, and familial tendencies and groupings found within those darker worlds."]}, {"page": "K Foundation", "response": ["Music journalist Sarah Champion pointed out (prior to the million pound fire) that, \"Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich.

We want to buy ships, have submarines.

The Invisibles combined political, pop- and sub-cultural references. Tapping into pre-millennial tension, the work was influenced by the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, Aleister Crowley and William Burroughs, and Morrison's practice of chaos magic in Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth.Irvine \"The Invisibles\" in Dougall (2008), pp. 92\u201397Neighly, Patrick & Kereth Cowe-Spigai. Anarchy for the Masses: The Disinformation Guide to the Invisibles. New York: Disinformation, 2003. In 1998 Morrison published the prose piece \"I'm A Policeman\" in Sarah Champion's millennial short story collection Disco 2000; though no explicit connection to The Invisibles is made, there are strong thematic links between the two works. At DisinfoCon in 1999, Morrison said that much of the content in The Invisibles was information given to them by aliens that abducted them in Kathmandu, who told them to spread this information to the world via a comic book. They later clarified that the experience they labelled as the \"Alien Abduction Experience in Kathmandu\" had nothing to do with aliens or abduction, but that there was an experience that they had in Kathmandu that The Invisibles is an attempt to explain. The title was not a huge commercial hit to start with. (Morrison actually asked their readers to participate in a \"wankathon\" while concentrating on a magical symbol, or sigil, in an effort to boost sales). When the title was relaunched with volume two, the characters relocated to America. Volume three appeared with issue numbers counting down, signalling an intention to conclude the series with the turn of the new millennium in 2000. Due to the title shipping late, its final issue did not ship until April 2000."]}, {"page": "Alan Warner", "response": ["His novella 'After the Vision' appeared in the anthology Children of Albion Rovers (1997), and his short story 'Bitter Salvage' was included in Disco Biscuits (1997), an anthology edited by Sarah Champion."]}, {"page": "Drawing Blood", "response": ["The characters Trevor and Zachary reappear in Brite's short story \"Vine of the Soul\", published in 1998 in Disco 2000, edited by Sarah Champion."]}, {"page": "Fuck the Millennium", "response": ["K2 Plant Hire also contributed a short story, written by Drummond, to editor Sarah Champion's anthology Disco 2000. \"'Let's Grind' or 'How K2\u00a0Plant Hire Went To Work'\" is a fictional account of K2\u00a0Plant Hire's plan to demolish Stonehenge on the eve of the millennium.
