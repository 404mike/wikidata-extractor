Smith is interested in the places where people go to seek refuge from the outside world: to escape boredom, to be diverted, transported, absorbed \u2013 places to lose oneself, where pretence and reality are often confused.\nSmith's photographs have documented the construction of fantasy and the architecture of entertainment, the function of which is to disconnect people from their everyday lives and concerns. Since 2005 her practice has expanded to include both still and moving images which address our struggle to feel connected: within society, the landscape and the wider universe. The photographs and videos often point to the gap between one's imagination and reality and the interplay between the two. The work flits between objectivity and subjectivity, the real and the fake.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people associated with Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["*Bridget Smith"]}, {"page": "Stephen McNeilly", "response": ["Stephen McNeilly (born 1968) is a London-based artist and writer whose research-lead practice includes photography, filmmaking, curating and book publishing.
