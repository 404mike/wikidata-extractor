At Southampton he linked up well with the other forwards, George Smith, John Bainbridge and John Lewis, as well as showing deft touches on the ball. In 1907\u201308 he played in all six FA Cup matches as The Saints reached the semi-finals, losing to Wolverhampton Wanderers who went on to take the cup in the final. His best seasons were 1908\u201309 and 1909\u201310, in each of which he scored 13 goals.

As a forward he was prone to over-elaboration but had a powerful shot. He made 21 league appearances, scoring five goals, and also played in all six FA Cup matches as Saints reached the semi-finals, losing to Wolverhampton Wanderers who went on to take the cup in the final."]}, {"page": "John Bainbridge", "response": ["John Bainbridge may refer to:", "* John Bainbridge (footballer) (1880\u20131960), English footballer", "* John Bainbridge (astronomer) (1582\u20131643), English astronomer", "* John Bainbridge (author) (born 1953), British author and countryside campaigner", "* John Bainbridge (Royal Navy officer) (1845\u20131901), Irish cricketer and Royal Navy officer"]}, {"page": "Frank Costello (footballer)", "response": ["He also played in all six FA Cup matches as Saints reached the semi-finals, losing to Wolverhampton Wanderers who went on to take the cup in the final. In the round four (quarter final) replay against Everton at The Dell on 11 March 1908 he played his best game for the \"Saints\". In the first half he hooked a John Johnston cross past the Everton goalkeeper Billy Scott. With the score 2\u20131 to Southampton at half-time, the second half \"belonged to Frank Costello\". He was involved in most of Southampton's attacks and when John Bainbridge swung over a deep cross from the right it appeared to have been over hit and going out of play. Suddenly, \"out of nowhere\", Costello arrived and met the ball with his head, sending it back over the goalkeeper into the far corner of the net. According to Duncan Holley in \"Match of the Millennium\", \"a contortionist would have had problems attaining a position ... to reach the ball.\" The Saints won the match 3\u20132, but lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi-final with goals from former Southampton players Wally Radford and George Hedley."]}, {"page": "Joe Blake", "response": ["Blake's next appearances came in March/April 1908, when he played three matches at outside-left in place of Bert Hodgkinson. Equally at home on either wing, Blake was awarded a professional contract in 1908, from when on his appearances were more frequent. In the 1908\u201309 season, he made twelve appearances, either as cover for Hodgkinson on the right or John Bainbridge on the left, including twice as inside-left, when he replaced Sam Shearer."]}, {"page": "Sam Brittleton", "response": ["He made his debut for the \"Saints\" in a 1\u20131 draw at Queens Park Rangers on 25 September 1909, when he replaced Frank Jordan at inside-left. Described as \"sometimes brilliant, sometimes hopeless\", Brittleton lost his place in the side after a run of nine matches, with Bob Carter replacing him. In March, after an injury to John Bainbridge, Carter moved to outside-right with Brittleton being recalled at inside-left. He marked his recall by scoring in a 1\u20131 draw at West Ham followed by another goal a week later against Portsmouth."]}, {"page": "Edward Bell (footballer)", "response": ["After a short period with Crystal Palace as an amateur in February 1907, when he made a small number of appearances in the reserve team in the London and Western League, and a trial with Portsmouth, Bell was signed by Southampton of the Southern League in March 1907. He went straight into the team, making two appearances at outside-right in April as a replacement for triallist J. Patten; both matches, against Queens Park Rangers and Fulham, ended in 3\u20130 defeats.

He made his debut for the \"Saints\" in the opening match of the 1909\u201310 season, a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. Described as a \"dapper little striker\" he soon became a crowd favourite and played in the first six matches, scoring once. He then lost his place at outside-right to John Bainbridge who had returned from injury. Davies spent the rest of the season in the reserves, making only two further first-team appearances."]}, {"page": "Stan Smith (footballer, born 1884)", "response": ["Smith was born in Southampton and played football for various local sides leading to representative honours for the Hampshire F.A. In 1908, he joined Southampton for whom he gained a reputation for \"accurately crossing the ball from awkward and seemingly impossible positions\". He made his first-team debut when he took the place of John Bainbridge on the right wing for the Christmas Day 1908 match at West Ham United, which ended in a 1\u20130 defeat. Smith retained his place for the next two matches before Bainbridge's return."]}]}}
