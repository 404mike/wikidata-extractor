The prosecuting counsel was Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, the Solicitor General and later Speaker of the House of Commons; counsel for the defence was Frederick Lawton, later a senior judge.  Megarry's tax affairs were complex, with his earnings as a lecturer dealt with by his wife and his self-employed income from his legal practice dealt with by his clerk. Each assumed that the other was dealing with certain items of income, but in fact neither did, so it was omitted from Megarry's tax returns. The judge directed the jury to acquit Megarry, on the grounds that the error was a genuine mistake with no intention to defraud the tax authorities."]}, {"page": "Lawton (surname)", "response": ["* Sir Frederick Lawton (1911\u20132001), English judge"]}, {"page": "Guenther Podola", "response": ["The start of the trial was delayed for nine days while a jury heard evidence of whether Podola was medically fit to stand trial.

When asked for his plea, he replied: \"I do not remember the crime for which I stand accused ... I am unable to answer the charges.\" He was defended by Frederick Lawton QC.
