During his playing days, he was a left-back, though can also play at centre-back.\nHe started his career with Leeds United, but gained his first taste of senior football at Bradford City, spending the 2006\u201307 season on loan at the club. He then spent part of the following season on loan at Darlington. Injuries meant that he made a limited contribution to the 2009\u201310 campaign, as Leeds won promotion out of League One. He was loaned out to Carlisle United in January 2011, and was released by Leeds in April 2012. He has also represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, and under-19 levels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pontefract", "response": ["* Ben Parker (1987\u2013), former footballer who played for Leeds United and represented England U19"]}, {"page": "Ben Parker", "response": ["Ben Parker may refer to:", "*Uncle Ben, Ben Parker, a fictional character who is the uncle of Peter Parker / Spider-Man", "*Ben Parker (footballer) (born 1987), English football player", "*Ben Parker, English singer-songwriter, member of Ben & Jason"]}, {"page": "Alan Sheehan", "response": ["On 31 January 2008, Sheehan joined Leeds United on loan for the rest of the season, making his debut in a 2\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers on 2 February 2008 replacing Ben Parker at left back.

He made two high-profile errors in the pre-season match against Blackburn Rovers when he gave away a penalty and was very lucky not to give away a second penalty.

Bodor also played for Leeds in their 3\u20132 win against Newcastle United at Elland Road, coming on as a second-half substitute.

With the loan signing of Lee Trundle from Bristol City, and the January transfer window signing of Mike Grella, manager Simon Grayson publicly stated that Becchio would be given a short resting period so that he would be ready for the vital last few months of the season, although that never materialised as Becchio was insistent on retaining his place in the team. Grayson frequently referred to Becchio as Lazarus due to various points in the season where he would be injured but would make a remarkable recovery to be fit and ready for the next match. In the final game of the season he scored his 18th goal of the season in all competitions, which in turn contributed to the relegation of Northampton Town. His 19th of the season came against Millwall in the League One play-off semi-final, in which he rounded off a fine team move started by Ben Parker, with Beckford and Andy Robinson also playing vital roles.

Following the trip, Anthony Griffith re-joined the club after securing his exit from League One rivals Leyton Orient. Mathias Kouo-Doumb\u00e9, Paul Reid and Ben Parker joined the club on trial, as Vale desperately needed more defensive cover.
