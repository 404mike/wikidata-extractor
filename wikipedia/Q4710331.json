Disgruntled by working conditions within coal mines, Goodwin sought to increase wages, improve working conditions, and fought against companies that disregarded their workers' rights. Goodwin participated and led multiple strikes, and served as a delegate for the British Columbia Federation of Labour, and as an organizer for the Socialist Party of Canada. In the years following his increased activism and involvement with labour unions, Goodwin fell under scrutiny for his beliefs against military conscription and was killed in the year of 1918. There is contention on whether Goodwin was a victim of murder or if his death was the result of self defence. His death inspired a one day general strike in Vancouver on August 2, 1918, which was the first general strike ever held in Canada. This strike served as the precursor to the Winnipeg general strike of 1919, and multiple other labour conflicts.", "link_mentions": {}}}
