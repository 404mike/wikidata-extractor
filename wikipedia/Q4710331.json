Disgruntled by working conditions within coal mines, Goodwin sought to increase wages, improve working conditions, and fought against companies that disregarded their workers' rights. Goodwin participated and led multiple strikes, and served as a delegate for the British Columbia Federation of Labour, and as an organizer for the Socialist Party of Canada. In the years following his increased activism and involvement with labour unions, Goodwin fell under scrutiny for his beliefs against military conscription and was killed in the year of 1918. There is contention on whether Goodwin was a victim of murder or if his death was the result of self defence. His death inspired a one day general strike in Vancouver on August 2, 1918, which was the first general strike ever held in Canada. This strike served as the precursor to the Winnipeg general strike of 1919, and multiple other labour conflicts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ginger Goodwin", "response": ["#REDIRECTAlbert Goodwin"]}, {"page": "Albert \"Ginger\" Goodwin", "response": ["#redirect Albert Goodwin"]}, {"page": "Cumberland, British Columbia", "response": ["* Albert Goodwin (1887\u20131918), labour activist"]}, {"page": "Albert Goodwin (disambiguation)", "response": ["Albert Goodwin (1887\u20131918) was a Canadian trade unionist.", "Albert Goodwin may also refer to:", "*Albert Goodwin (historian) (1906\u20131995), English historian", "*Albert Goodwin (artist) (1845\u20131932), English landscape painter"]}, {"page": "War resister", "response": ["On November 9, 2010, Canadian writer Peter Smollett referred to people opposing World War I as \"war resisters.\" Among the people he mentioned were Albert Goodwin and Siegfried Sassoon."]}, {"page": "Anti-union violence", "response": ["* With casualties as one indication of its national history, a union pamphlet published in 2006 counted a total of 24 \"Canadian Labour Martyrs\" since 1903, a number that includes Joseph Mairs of the Vancouver Island War of 1912-14, coal miner Albert Goodwin killed in 1918, miner Bill Davis of Nova Scotia (namesake of the William Davis Miners' Memorial Day), and the 1929 case of Rosvall and Voutilainen in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

When Goodwin began working the Cumberland mines, he found the working conditions appalling and convinced his local union to \"down tools\" in protest. These actions spread encouragement for others to join in civil disobedience and led to the coal mining strike of 1912. The strike failed to achieve the workers' goals but is measured as one of Canada's most expensive economic burdens.
