He was elected F.R.S. in 1829. He worked as Chemical Operator at Apothecaries' Hall, London.\nIn 1825 Michael Faraday discovered that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas. He gave the resulting solution to Hennell, who found in 1826 that it contained \"sulphovinic acid\" (ethyl hydrogen sulfate). Hennell's finding was a major breakthrough in the synthesis of ethanol and led to major developments in organic chemistry.\nThe late Sir Humphry Davy entertained and expressed the highest opinion of him as a man of science\u2014and he was held in equal esteem by Professor Brande and Mr. Faraday, of the former of whom he was a pupil for fourteen years.\nHe lost his life in a very shocking manner. He was, at the urgent request of the East India Company, preparing about six pounds of fulminating mercury for the percussion caps to be used in the East, when a tremendous explosion took place, which alarmed the whole neighbourhood, destroyed 1000 panes of glass, and blew the unfortunate gentleman to pieces.\nOne arm was found on the roof of the Apothecaries' Hall, and a finger was picked up in Union Street more than a hundred yards distant.\nHennell's successor as Chemical Operator at Apothecaries' Hall was Robert Warington.", "link_mentions": {}}}
