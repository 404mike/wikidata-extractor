He was elected F.R.S. in 1829. He worked as Chemical Operator at Apothecaries' Hall, London.\nIn 1825 Michael Faraday discovered that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas. He gave the resulting solution to Hennell, who found in 1826 that it contained \"sulphovinic acid\" (ethyl hydrogen sulfate). Hennell's finding was a major breakthrough in the synthesis of ethanol and led to major developments in organic chemistry.\nThe late Sir Humphry Davy entertained and expressed the highest opinion of him as a man of science\u2014and he was held in equal esteem by Professor Brande and Mr. Faraday, of the former of whom he was a pupil for fourteen years.\nHe lost his life in a very shocking manner. He was, at the urgent request of the East India Company, preparing about six pounds of fulminating mercury for the percussion caps to be used in the East, when a tremendous explosion took place, which alarmed the whole neighbourhood, destroyed 1000 panes of glass, and blew the unfortunate gentleman to pieces.\nOne arm was found on the roof of the Apothecaries' Hall, and a finger was picked up in Union Street more than a hundred yards distant.\nHennell's successor as Chemical Operator at Apothecaries' Hall was Robert Warington.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ethanol", "response": ["Ethanol was first prepared synthetically in 1825 by Michael Faraday. He found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas. In a footnote on page 448, Faraday notes the action of sulfuric acid on coal gas and coal-gas distillate; specifically, \"The [sulfuric] acid combines directly with carbon and hydrogen; and I find when [the resulting compound is] united with bases [it] forms a peculiar class of salts, somewhat resembling the sulphovinates [i.e., ethyl sulfates], but still different from them.\" He gave the resulting solution to Henry Hennell, a British chemist, who found in 1826 that it contained \"sulphovinic acid\" (ethyl hydrogen sulfate). On page 248, Hennell mentions that Faraday gave him some sulfuric acid in which coal gas had dissolved and that he (Hennell) found that it contained \"sulphovinic acid\" (ethyl hydrogen sulfate). In 1828, Hennell and the French chemist Georges-Simon Serullas independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol. On page 368, Hennell produces ethanol from \"sulfovinic acid\" (ethyl hydrogen sulfate). On page 158, S\u00e9rullas mentions the production of alcohol from \"sulfate acid d'hydrog\u00e8ne carbon\u00e9\" (hydrocarbon acid sulfate). Thus, in 1825 Faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from ethylene (a component of coal gas) by acid-catalyzed hydration, a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis.In 1855, the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot confirmed Faraday's discovery by preparing ethanol from pure ethylene.  (Note: The chemical formulas in Berthelot's paper are wrong because chemists at that time used the wrong atomic masses for the elements; e.g., carbon (6 instead of 12), oxygen (8 instead of 16), etc.)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| Henry Hennell||12/03/1829||- 11 June 1842"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1829", "response": ["# Henry Hennell (d. 1842)"]}, {"page": "Frederick Penney", "response": ["He studied Chemistry at the Royal Institution under Michael Faraday.http://strathclyde.ica-atom.org/frederick-penny-papers;isad?sf_culture=en He served an apprenticeship under Henry Hennell at Apothocaries Hall in London 1833 to 1838 then went to Giessen University in central Germany where he obtained a doctorate (PhD) in 1839.
