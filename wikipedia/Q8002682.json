Big Dada was created with a similarly open-minded remit to sister label Ninja Tune, traversing the boundaries between hip hop, grime and ragga. Born out of a frustration over acts going unappreciated elsewhere, Big Dada swiftly cemented itself as a force in its own right. The name came up in reference to Ashon's love of Kool Keith, who he'd described in print as the \"Mac Dada\", as a combination of mac daddy and Dadaism."]}, {"page": "Roots Manuva", "response": ["Smith made his recorded debut in 1994 as part of IQ Procedure through Suburban Base's short-lived hip hop imprint Bluntly Speaking Vinyl.

The brilliant pop hip-hop of Skee-Lo comes via persistent plugging from Radio One and a certain degreee of dancefloor popularity.\" Ross Jones from The Guardian wrote, \"Over a snake-hipped R&B groove, the boy's light-hearted delivery and humble subject matter invite favourable comparisons with both The Pharcyde and Souls Of Mischief.\"Jones, Ross (November 18, 1995). \"Reviews: Singles\". p. 33.

A reviewer from Music Week rated it four out of five, adding, \"A low-down, funky, rolling vibe from the LA-based rapper. Old-school funk fused with jazzy tinges do justice to a tune which deserves to cause waves, and not just in the hip hop fraternity.\" Will Ashon from Muzik described it as \"a ludicrous, dayglo, superfly wish-list from the self-depreciating and immediately likeable Skee-Lo\". James Hunter from Vibe commented, \"Dreaming of girls, cars, and height, his 'I Wish' is a most excellent pop-rap hit. Prom-night celebrity, that's his aspiration, and nobody's articulated it better in years. Skee-Lo wins because he doesn't try to sound like anything he's not\"."]}, {"page": "Juice Aleem", "response": ["After putting years of energy into the Birmingham hip hop scene, Juice's \"Ghetto Grammer\" freestyle rap sessions started featuring such other future stars as Ty, Skinnyman and MPHO.
