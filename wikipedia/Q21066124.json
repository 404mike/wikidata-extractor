Wattana won the final two frames on the final black and pink respectively to notch a 10\u20138 victory in the fourth qualifying round.Everton, Clive (ed.), Snooker Scene, March 1990. p. 27. Spencer's victory over Owers was his last ever victory in a recognised ranking competition. In the 1991 World Championship, he lost his first match to Ray Edmonds 4\u201310, finally giving Edmonds a victory over Spencer in a rivalry that stretched back to Spencer's victory over him in the 1965 English Amateur Championships. At the time Spencer indicated a strong desire to carry on playing and stated that he was planning to enter all of the events the following season.Everton, Clive (ed.), Snooker Scene May 1991, p. 7.
