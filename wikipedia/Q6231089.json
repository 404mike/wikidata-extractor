Everton's only absentee was defender Earl Barrett who was cup-tied, and had therefore not been part of Everton's FA cup campaign. Duncan Ferguson passed a fitness test on the day of the game, however, Ferguson was only given a place on the substitutes bench, with Everton fielding the same starting XI that defeated Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup semi-final. There was no place among the substitutes for homegrown boyhood Blue John Ebbrell, with Daniel Amokachi being preferred on the bench after he scored twice in the semi-final. Stuart Barlow and Vinny Samways were the other players from the original 17-man cup final squad to not make the 14-man matchday squad. Ebbrell, Barlow and Samways all missed the semi-final against Spurs due to injury, allowing Amokachi to take a place on the substitutes bench; he then scored two goals after mistakenly coming on for Paul Rideout. Rideout had been a doubt for the game with a knee ligament injury and appeared to have suffered a recurrence midway through the second half; after receiving treatment from the Everton physio, Rideout indicated he was ready to return to action, but Amokachi misinterpreted his signal and entered the field, with the substitution confirmed by the fourth official."]}, {"page": "1995 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|MF ||14|| John Ebbrell"]}, {"page": "Wirral Grammar School for Boys", "response": ["* John Ebbrell, former football player for Everton F.C. as a midfielder"]}, {"page": "Everton F.C. supporters", "response": ["* John Ebbrell"]}, {"page": "Ebbrell, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Ebbrell"]}, {"page": "Ebbrell", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Ebbrell"]}]}}
