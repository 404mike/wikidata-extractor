To impress Marion, who referred to herself as \"Stardust Lil\", Eddie told her that he was a businessman and was not expecting to meet her, so when the situation arose, he borrowed the key to Mike Baldwin's flat from Hilda, then Mike's housekeeper, and told Marion the flat was his. Hilda found out first but Eddie, was unsure how to tell Marion the truth, had copied the keys and started meeting Marion there regularly. Mike found out when he found post and phone messages for Eddie, but he let Eddie meet Marion there one last time to tell her the truth. To Eddie's relief, the truth made Marion even more attracted to him, as she had been having doubts that they were right for each other due to his supposed wealth. When he realised he was in love with her, Eddie told Marion about his time in prison and when she accepted it, he proposed to her. They got engaged but Marion did not want to marry immediately. After a few months, Marion's ex-boyfriend, Phil Moss (Ken Kitson), turned up to try to win her back. Thinking he might not be good enough and feeling jealous, Eddie ended their engagement and Marion left but returned to tell Eddie that she wanted him. After reconciling with Marion, Eddie intended to raise money to buy a house and invested \u00a31000 in Geoff Siddall's (Edward Judd) car business. When Eddie realised that he had been conned, Marion left him and told him to stay away. Eddie did not take this well and disappeared but was eventually found in Liverpool. When Marion followed Eddie there, they reconciled again and their engagement was back on."]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Marion Yeats || Veronica Doran || 1982\u20131983"]}, {"page": "Adventures of a Private Eye", "response": ["* Veronica Doran as Maud"]}, {"page": "The Haunted House of Horror", "response": ["*Veronica Doran as Madge"]}, {"page": "Farrington of the F.O.", "response": ["Notable guest stars throughout the run of the two series included (in no particular order) Tim Barrett, Francesca Gonshaw, Jan Ravens, Ralph Bates, Annette Crosbie, Russell Hunter, Roger Hammond, Veronica Doran, Kevin Lloyd, Elizabeth Sellars, Edward de Souza, Robin Parkinson, Patsy Smart, and John Moreno.
