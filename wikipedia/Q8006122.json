Bullen was an all-rounder, described as a fast bowler and a \"powerful hitter\".Bullen played in 113 first-class cricket matches between 1773 and 1797, playing primarily for Kent county cricket teams and \"England\" sides. He is reputed to have \"regularly bowled a cricket ball a distance of 300 yards\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["Individual bowlers take great credit if they can capture five or more wickets in an innings.  The earliest known instance of this was by William Bullen, who bowled five batsmen out when playing for All-England v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine in 1774.  Scorecards were still uncommon at the time and bowling analyses were incomplete; bowlers were only credited with \"bowled\" victims, catches being awarded to the fielder only."]}, {"page": "George Louch", "response": ["He was a native of Chatham and educated at Westminster school.

Dartford had played against a Hambledon team three times in 1756 and Kent played against Hampshire at Broadhalfpenny Down in 1768.ACS, op. cit., p. 23.Waghorn, Cricket Scores, p. 66. Kent played numerous inter-county matches through the 1770s and 1780s, mostly against Hampshire and Surrey. Renowned Kent players in this period included William Bullen, Robert Clifford, Joseph Miller and John Minshull. Large crowds were attracted to games in the county and Derek Birley states in his history that 20,000 gathered at Bourne Paddock for a match against Hampshire in 1772.Birley, op. cit., p. 37. Kent remained an active county team until 1796 when, probably because of the war situation, county cricket ceased and was not resurrected until 1825 when Kent met Sussex at Brighton's Royal New Ground.Haygarth, op. cit., p. 514.ACS, op. cit., p. 33."]}, {"page": "1774 English cricket season", "response": ["In the match between Hampshire and England on 7\u20138 July, bowler William Bullen took the first known five wicket haul in first-class matches.

The question of nomenclature arises here because, with at least three \"given men\" (i.e., borrowed players), on each side the match is also called Duke of Dorset's XI versus Sir Horatio Mann's XI after the two team patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset and Sir Horatio (Horace) Mann. The \"East Kent\" team, Mann's XI, included John Small, Richard Aubrey Veck and Lamborn of Hambledon and Hampshire. The \"West Kent\" team, Dorset's XI, featured the Hambledon players Noah Mann and Tom Sueter with the Chertsey and Surrey players William Bedster and Lumpy Stevens. Noted Kent players involved in the match include Joseph Miller, William Bullen, William Bowra, Robert Clifford and Thomas Pattenden.Haygarth, pp. 47\u201348. Sevenoaks Vine was Dorset's home ground and there was a return match at Bourne Paddock at Mann's Bourne Park House near Bishopsbourne from 8 to 11 August. This also featured guest players with Surrey's William Yalden and Hampshire's James Aylward joining Small, Lamborn, Sueter, Bedster, Mann and Stevens.Haygarth, pp. 49\u201350.

Lumpy Stevens of Chertsey and Surrey was, as Haygarth says, a \"given man\" on the Hambledon/Hampshire side but, in addition, the team included Earl of Winchilsea (White Conduit Club), Edward Hussey (Kent) and William Fennex (Middlesex). The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris. On the Kent side, the given man was William Bedster who, like Stevens, was employed by the Earl of Tankerville and played for Chertsey and Surrey. Kent included George T. Boult of Berkshire and, later, Middlesex. The other nine were usually associated with Kent: Stephen Amherst, James Aylward (though he played for Hampshire until 1779), Francis Booker, John Boorman, William Bowra, William Brazier, William Bullen, Robert Clifford and Henry Crozoer."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|William Bullen", "|William Bullen, CricketArchive.
