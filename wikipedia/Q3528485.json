He also played 28 Test matches for England. He was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1967.\nAn outstanding schoolboy cricketer at Ruthin School, Barber initially struggled to gain a place whilst at Cambridge after making his debut in 1955. Scoring 1000 runs for the first time in 1959, Barber was made captain of Lancashire.\nHampered by an intrusive committee and hostile crowd, Barber was perceived as not making the best of his own abilities, particularly as a leg spinner, though in a team boasting Test leg spinner Tommy Greenhough and useful allrounders in Grieves and Booth, both of whom were wrist spinners, Barber found it difficult to earn a place. He was replaced by Joe Blackledge in 1962, who met with no greater success as the county endured a difficult season. Joining Warwickshire, Barber was encouraged to play his shots and began to play regularly for England as an opening batsman. His greatest innings, and his only Test century, was made in the Third Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1965\u201366. He made 185 off 255 balls and added 234 in even time with Geoff Boycott for the first wicket. It remains the highest score by an Englishman on the opening day of an Ashes Test. E.W. Swanton wrote:\n\nOften in bleak moments do I cast back to Bob Barber's 185 in front of 40,000 on that sunny Friday in January '66. He batted without chance for five hours, starting decorously enough and then hitting the ball progressively harder and with a superb disdain to every corner of the field. One recalls the exceptional vigour of his driving and how he brought his wrists into the cut, making room for the stroke. It made blissful watching to English eyes \u2013 to one pair in particular, for by a wonderful chance father Barber had flown in from home that very day.\nIn 1969 he retired from county cricket although he appeared in the John Player League until 1971. Prominent in the early years of the Gillette Cup, he made little impression in the 40-over game. After retiring from cricket, Barber went into business and lives in Switzerland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 26", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 Bob Barber, English cricketer "]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["England hosted New Zealand and South Africa in 1965.

In the second Test, Boycott made a duck in the first innings and later took 140 minutes to score 16 runs when England needed to score quickly; Wisden described the latter innings as a \"dreadful effort when courage was needed\". Subsequently, Boycott was dropped and replaced by Eric Russell.McKinstry, pp. 65\u201366. Boycott returned to the team at the end of the season for the tour to Australia.

Barber had been a simple push and run player for Lancashire before transferring to M.J.K. Smith's Warwickshire in 1963 and flowered into the most attacking opener in England. He was an excellent foil to Boycott's pedestrian run-making and they were the best opening pair England had had in years.

He was injured in the only Test he played on the tour, where he came in last and held out for 10 minutes in an unbeaten duck.", "The retirement of England's great new-ball partnership of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham left a yawning gap in the England attack. The fast bowler John Snow would take 31 wickets (22.83) in the 1970\u201371 Ashes series, but he was not chosen for the tour and went to South Africa to play club cricket. Brown was 6'4\" tall and was noted for his steep bounce and was regarded as England's best new ball bowler, his 5/63 forced Australia to follow on in the Third Test at Sydney. The Scottish seamer David Larter was even taller at 6'\u00a07\" and had a ridiculously long run, but he lacked self-confidence, and an ankle injury on the tour ended his career. Jeff Jones was a Welsh left-arm bowler of genuine pace and the father of Simon Jones he took 6/118 in the Fourth Test, but troubled the umpires by running on the pitch and was not really of Test class. Ken Higgs revived his career in 1965 as Brian Statham's new ball partner for Lancashire and took 4/47 and 4/96 against the powerful South African batting at the Oval in 1965. Due to stomach cramps he was not used much in Australia, but took 17 wickets (9.23) in New Zealand, then 24 wickets (25.45) back home against the West Indies. With England's bowlers laid low, the all-rounder Barry Knight was called up. A veteran of the 1962\u201363 Ashes series, he liked to drop the ball short, but lacked the pace to worry the Australians. Even so, he took 4/84 in the Second Test when the hosts were out for 358 on a flat wicket. Geoff Boycott was a useful medium-paced bowler in his youth, known to wear his cap backwards as he bowled, and was used as the third new ball bowler in the Third and Fourth Tests. David Allen and Fred Titmus returned after their successful tour in 1962\u201363, but were only useful on the famous spinning wicket at Sydney, taking 4/47 and 4/40 in the second innings of England's victory. Elsewhere they were expensive and could only be used for containment. Ken Barrington had started life as a leg-spinner and was a good bowler at club level, as was Bob Barber, and commentators thought they should have been used more widely considering England's poor attack, but Smith only tried them when a draw was a foregone conclusion."]}, {"page": "Alfred Tasker", "response": ["Alfred George Ernest Tasker (born 16 June 1934 in Southwark, London) was an English first-class cricketer who played in one match, keeping wicket for Worcestershire against Cambridge University in 1956.

Bill Playle (45) and Peter Kelly (126) batted slowly to add 91 for the first wicket, but Western Australia collapsed to 303/9 with only Derek Chadwick (52 not out) offering any late resistance to the fast bowling of Jeff Jones who took five wickets for nine runs. Shepherd declared after avoiding the follow on and Edrich (45) and Peter Parfitt (48) added 75 for the third wicket, before being removed by the leg-spinner Terry Jenner (4/72). Parks and Dave Allen had hit 53 runs for the sixth wicket when Smith asked his manager Billy Griffiths when he should declare, Griffiths said \"Now\" and their 156/5 left Western Australia 274 minutes to make 301 runs for victory. David Larter (4/49) had them 53/3, with the opener Pat Kelley retired hurt after being hit on the head by a bouncer by the tall Scottish bowler. There was a short break to listen to the Melbourne Cup and Kelley returned to add 171 with Murray Vernon, the highest fourth wicket stand for Western Australia against the MCC. Though in sight of victory the hosts collapsed once Vernon was bowled for 118 by Jones (2/39), Kelly was left stranded on 108 not out, the first Western Australian to make two centuries in a match against the MCC, with no other batsman making more than 11. Western Australia were out for 291 to give the MCC a thrilling 9 run win in the last minute. \"That's the last time I take the ruddy manager's advice on a declaration\" joked Smith.p132, Swantonpp23-33, John Clarke, With England in Australia, Stanley Paul, 1966", "As Perth did not have a Test match, players from the eastern states were sent to strengthen Western Australia for a second game against the tourists. On this occasion only the veteran batsman Peter Burge of Queensland and the young Bob Cowper of Victoria were flown over. Barry Shepherd won the toss and put the MCC in to bat on a day interrupted by four showers. After an opening stand of 74 between Bob Barber (34) and John Edrich (92), Laurie Mayne (3/98) reduced them to 199/6. M.J.K. Smith (112 not out) and Fred Titmus (69) restored the situation with a seventh wicket stand of 139 before Smith declared at 379/7 during a shower in the second afternoon 'to get out of the wet'.p38, Clarke Murray Vernon and Pat Kelly added 47 runs in ten overs before they were out in successive balls. Cowper (89) and Burge (52) top-scored in the Combined XI's slow 231/5, Shepherd again declaring after the follow on had been avoided. In reply Bob Barber (113) reached 100 in 89 minutes and helped by Peter Parfitt, Colin Cowdrey and Smith, who all made 24, the MCC made 205/4 to leave the hosts 354 runs to win in 273 minutes. Vernon (44) and Kelly (33) added 71 for the first wicket and Cowper made 122 not out, adding 87 with Burge (50) and 84 with Shepherd (39 not out), but they fell 32 runs short with 4 wickets in hand and the game was a draw.pp34-42, Clarke", "In another friendly country match the locals team batted first and sportingly declared for 167/6 with Bob Barber taking 4/21 with his leg spin, being fed loose balls to give the tourists some sort of target, and having their innings declared by the umpires after 46 overs in accordance with local grade cricket rules. In reply Barber's first four balls were 264W and the MCC made 168/4 in 95 minutes, but batted on to 264 to entertain the 4,500 strong crowd. Eric Russell made 50, Jim Parks hit 75 and the local fast bowler R. McKenzie took 4/44.pp50-51, Clarke", "Bill Lawry won the toss for Victoria and elected to bat, making 153 himself and adding 104 for the first wicket with Ian Redpath (53). When Lawry reached 100 his bails were found on the ground and Cowdrey and Murray appealed for hit wicket, but the umpire gave him not out as no one has seen the bails knocked off.pp51-52, Clarke In the afternoon Dave Brown took 4/77 to reduce them to 262/7. The following morning Graeme Watson made 59 not out and added 122 runs with Bob Cowper's brother David Cowper (the wicketkeeper), who made 60 not out on his First Class debut. Lawry declared on 384/7 and almost bowled out the MCC in the remainder of the day, they were 211/9 at stumps and all out for the same score first thing on the third day. John Edrich and M.J.K. Smith both made 46, but Keith Stackpole's 4/64 with his occasional off-spin that caused the most damage on a turning wicket. Lawry declined to enforce the follow on and batted again, making 61, but seeing his team fall for 165 to the Fred Titmus (4/50) and Ken Barrington (4/24). This left the MCC 329 to win, but Alan Connolly (4/84) removed Bob Barber for a duck and Edrich for 1 before they recovered to 65/2 at the end of the day. Ken Barrington dug himself in for 158 \"an innings of rugged, fighting grandeur\",p58, Clarke and added 160 for the fourth wicket with Colin Cowdrey. After Cowdrey was out for a lacklustre 52 the tail collapsed to Watson's medium paced bowling (3/24) to be out for 306, 32 runs short of their goal. The defeat did little to dampen the MCC's reputation for exciting cricket as they had chased the runs, and it was their only defeat until the Fourth Test.", "New South Wales had been the dominant team in the Sheffield Shield and in 1965\u201366 would win their fourteenth title since the war, but their last for fifteen years. Mike Smith won the toss and only Peter Parfitt failed to pass 50 in the MCC's 527/6 declared. Bob Barber (90) and Eric Russell (93) added 150 for the first wicket in the morning session, until Barber underestimated Booth's fielding, and was run out going for a century before lunch. Colin Cowdrey and Jim Parks both made 63, Smith 59 and the spinners Fred Titmus (80 not out) and Dave Allen (54 not out) made 121 runs for the seventh wicket. The leg-spinner Peter Philpott was the best of the suffering bowlers with 3/126 and the wicketkeeper Brian Taber took three catches, stumped Russell and ran out Parfitt. The New South Wales reply relied heavily on a third wicket stand of 142 between the 19-year-old Doug Walters (129) and his captain Brian Booth (80), who was standing in for the injured Bobby Simpson. They were out for 288 thanks to the fast bowling of Jeff Jones (3/76), before he was banned from bowling by Umpire Burgess because he was running down the wicket and leaving a groove that could be exploited by the bowlers.p134, Swanton The spin of Titmus (3/54) and Allen (2/75) took over and Smith made NSW follow on. Grahame Thomas top scored with 56, but they were out for 240 to Titmus (5/45) and Allen (2/47). The batsmen Barry Rothwell bowled the only over and had Barber out for a duck, but Parfitt made the two runs required and the MCC won by 9 wickets. It was the first time that the MCC had defeated New South Wales since Douglas Jardine beat them by an innings in 1932\u201333.", "With his vice captain Colin Cowdrey ill for most of December M.J.K. Smith continued to captain the MCC, won the toss and batted. Geoff Boycott rejoined the touring team after suffering sciatica and made 30, but Bob Barber retired ill at 21. The other openers Eric Russell (110) and John Edrich (133) came in next and the MCC passed 250 for the loss of one wicket. Ken Barrington (80 not out) and Fred Titmus (51 not out) added 86 for the sixth wicket and Smith declared at 452/5 on the afternoon of the second day. In reply Queensland were out for 222, with Des Bull (25) and Sam Trimble (34) adding 59 for the first wicket and captain Peter Burge making most of the rest with an unbeaten 114. The wickets were shared around the bowlers with Jeff Jones taking 2/36, Ken Higgs 3/35, Fred Titmus 2/79 and the recovered Barber 2/33. Boycott and Smith were out for ducks in the MCC's second innings, Russell retired hurt on 45, John Edrich made 68 not out and they declared on 123/2. Queensland were set 364 runs to win in 272 minutes and survived the day on 315/8. Trimble (31) and Bull (64) made another good start with 65 for the first wicket, Burge made 60 and Tom Veivers 74. Again the wickets were spread around with Titmus the best with 3/56, but Barber was hit for 1/74 off 10 overs.", "Unusually the MCC were scheduled to play a minor game immediately before the First Test and travelled 80 miles inland to the large town of Toowoomba. Mike Smith won the toss, fielded and used 10 bowlers in the Queensland Country innings before they declared on 157/4, Gary Jennings making nearly half their runs with his 77. Bob Barber made 56 of his 80 run opening stand with Geoff Boycott, who hung around to make 48 not out in the MCC's 159/3 as they won by seven wickets.", "The Prime Minister of Australia Robert Menzies was a keen cricket fan and the match between his personally chosen XI and the MCC was a highlight of the tour, followed by a banquet in which the Menzies would entertain the teams with a speech.pp135-136, Swanton His team consisted of Australian Test players such as Wally Grout, Alan Connolly and Bob Cowper, retired veterans Neil Harvey, Richie Benaud and Jim Burke, young talent like Keith Stackpole, the teenaged Paul Sheahan as well as the famous West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall, who was playing for Queensland. Benaud captained the team and fulfilled 90% of his duties by winning the toss and choosing to bat. Thanks to Burke (79), Sheahan (60), Benaud (45) and Stackpole (32 not out) the Prime Minister's XI hit 288/7 in 35 overs, with the wickets shared amongst the touring bowlers with Jeff Jones taking 2/21, David Larter 2/43 and Bob Barber 2/72. The declaration came halfway through the day and the MCC's winning 289/8 also took 35 overs, though they passed 200 for the loss of two wickets as Geoff Boycott made 95 before he was run out, Colin Cowdrey 52 and M.J.K. Smith 51 not out. Eight bowlers were used, but the best was Jim Burke who took 2/5 with his infamous chucking action, dismissing John Murray and Jones for ducks in the closing minutes of the match.", "After a string of four minor games the MCC played South Australia on either side of Christmas, with Christmas Day and Boxing Day being rest days. Les Favell won the toss and batted. Lynn Marks and Les Cunningham were out for ducks, but Favell (40) added 58 for the second wicket with Ian Chappell (59), followed by Brian Shiell who made his highest First Class score of 202 not out, adding 146 with Barry Jarman (70), 51 with George Griffiths (23) and 129 with David Sincock (28 not out) when Favell declared at 459/5 at lunch on the second day.

Smith made 108, adding 136 with Ken Barrington (63), while John Murray (110) and Fred Titmus (79) put together 164 for the eight wicket. The MCC's 444 nearly matched South Australia's score and Favell set about making runs for a declaration, Ian Chappell hitting 113 not out as they rattled up 253/4 in 249 minutes. Left to make 269 runs in three hours the MCC responded in kind, Boycott (58) and Barber (77) made 138 for the first wicket, Cowdrey made 63 not out and the all rounder Barry Knight (46) was promoted up the order so that he could hit some quick runs. The tourists made 270/4 and won a good-natured match by 6 wickets.", "The MCC played the combined grade teams of Northern New South Wales in a three-day game at the industrial town of Newcastle. The New South Welshmen batted first and Charlie Barker (101) became only the second player to make a century in a minor game against the MCC since the war. He added 196 for the fourth wicket with Michael Hill (98) as the home team made 334, with Bob Barber taking 4/57 with his leg-spin. The MCC were in real trouble at 106/5, but M.J.K.

The captain of Tasmania was the wicketkeeper Len Maddocks, who had moved there from Victoria, but he lost the toss and M.J.K. Smith who rested some of his best players and decided to open the batting with Bob Barber. Smith top-scored with 96 and Jim Parks 91, though fellow-keeper John Murray was out for a duck. Colin Cowdrey made 63 and Barry Knight a quick-fire 45 not out. The fast-medium bowler Harold Allen took 3/63 and the leg-spinner Ken Flint suffered with 3/133.

They added 46 for the first wicket, then Cowdrey (108), Parks (58) and Knight (51 not out) batted out the day with 289/7. It was the first tour match in which the MCC had not gone for a win, a policy which continued for the last few games and this rubbed some of the shine off their earlier bright cricket.", "The MCC returned to Sydney for their second match against New South Wales, but Bobby Simpson was in charge and he opened the batting with Norm O'Neill after winning the toss. O'Neill made 38 in their stand of 77, then Simpson (123) added 156 for the second wicket with Grahame Thomas (126). Doug Walters made 57 as New South Wales hit 374/4 on the first day.
