The first of those missions was concocted and attempted by five Wyalusing sailors on 26 May. They rowed up Middle River that afternoon carrying two 100-pound torpedoes, and then carried them by stretcher across the swampland separating the Middle and Roanoke Rivers to a point just above and opposite Albemarle's mooring place at Plymouth. Two of the sailors then swam across the river with a towline attached to the explosive devices and then hauled them across. The torpedoes were then joined by a bridle, and one of the sailors guided them down toward the ram hoping to place the bridle across her prow with a torpedo making contact with either side of her hull. He was then to swim clear before another man stationed across the river detonated the torpedoes electrically. The Confederates caught sight of both swimmer and torpedoes when they were just a few yards short of their goal. A hail of musketry from the shore followed soon after a sentry's hail. The swimmer quickly cut the guide line, retired, and then swam back across the river. The five Union sailors scattered. Three returned to Wyalusing on the evening of 28 May. The remaining two rejoined their ship the following night after rescue by Commodore Hull. The five men, Coxswain John W. Lloyd, Coal Heavers Charles H. Baldwin and Benjamin Lloyd, and Firemen Alexander Crawford and John Laverty, ultimately received the Medal of Honor for their attempt."]}, {"page": "2006 British Superbike Championship", "response": ["|  John Laverty"]}, {"page": "2008 British Superbike Championship", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  John Laverty", "|align=\"left\"|  John Laverty", "John Laverty won the Cup class on his Buildbase NW200 Ducati."]}, {"page": "List of 2008 motorsport champions", "response": ["|  John Laverty"]}, {"page": "2009 British Superbike Championship", "response": ["|  John Laverty", "|align=\"left\"|  John Laverty"]}, {"page": "Ian Lowry", "response": ["For 2011 Lowry signed for the Buildbase team who had moved from Kawasaki machinery to the new BMW S1000RR.
