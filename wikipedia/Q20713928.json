In 1871 Phoenix completed the locomotive named Governor Weld which was the first steam locomotive to operate in Western Australia. Also in August 1871 the foundry successfully tendered for the first Victorian Government railway locomotive contracts, with the first locomotive being delivered on 27 February 1873, and by 1884 over 350 men were employed. Modernisation of the works was carried out after Shaw visited Britain in 1871 and 1885, with the workshops becoming the most advanced in the southern hemisphere. The hundredth locomotive was completed in April 1883 and the two hundredth by October 1887. The majority of locomotives built were duplicates of imported 'pattern engines' designed and built overseas by other companies."]}, {"page": "George Threlfall (engineer)", "response": ["In 1854 this business was renamed Carter & Co in Armstrong Street, Ballarat with the addition of partners, iron-founder William Shaw, moulder Robert Holden and engine smith Richard Carter, producing a wide range of products.
