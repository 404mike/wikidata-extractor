He made his debut for England against Wales in 1972 and made a further 15 appearances with his final one being against France in 1978. His 16 caps included four wins, although these were against New Zealand, South Africa, Australia and Wales. Old also played in the famous victory of the North of England over the touring All Blacks at Otley in 1979 with the English regional side running out 21-9 winners.\nOld was selected for the 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa but could not displace Phil Bennett at fly-half. He played in only four matches on the tour, scoring a then-record 37 points in the match against South West Districts. His tour was ended by a serious leg injury in the match against the Proteas.\nHe was often more admired by England fans than by the selectors. On one occasion, a fan was so enraged when a player whom he considered to be inferior was selected in Old's place that he reputedly composed a letter of complaint pointing out the many ways in which Old would have been a better choice and then sent a copy to each member of the selection committee, written in Braille.Old is the brother of former England fast bowler Chris Old, and the brothers achieved a notable feat when Alan represented his country against Scotland at Murrayfield, whilst Chris was playing for England against the West Indies in the Caribbean. Alan was also a cricketer, playing 40 Minor County matches for Durham between 1968 and 1978 and one 2nd X1 appearance for Middlesex against Kent in 1970.  He also played in one first-class match for Warwickshire against Cambridge University in 1969.\nAfter the end of his playing career, Alan Old became a successful educationalist, serving as the Principal of Cleveland Technical College, having already been a master at Worksop College and a mathematics teacher at Sir William Turner's Grammar School, Redcar during his playing career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 23", "response": ["*  1945   \u2013 Alan Old, English rugby player"]}, {"page": "Leicester Tigers", "response": ["1974: Alan Old"]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough College", "response": ["* Alan Old, England rugby union international from 1972\u20131978"]}, {"page": "1974 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["* Alan Old (Leicester and England)"]}, {"page": "Chris Old", "response": ["His brother, Alan Old, is a former England rugby union international, who played one first-class match for Warwickshire against Cambridge University in 1969, and also played Minor Counties cricket for Durham in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "List of Durham University people", "response": ["* Alan Old \u2013 England international and British and Irish Lion, participated in 1974 South Africa tour"]}, {"page": "Worksop College", "response": ["* Alan Old - England rugby fly half 1972\u20131978"]}, {"page": "Ray Price (rugby)", "response": ["Ray Price began his career playing rugby union for Junior Club Dundas Valley, played senior rugby union for the Parramatta Two Blues, New South Wales Waratahs and represented the Wallabies in seven Tests, as flanker/breakaway, between 1974 and 1975, scoring four tries. One of these was against the New Zealand All Blacks, when, following a wayward penalty kick, Price wrested the ball from an in-goal defender, and scored. During the 1975 England rugby tour of Australia, Price was so intimidating off the back of the lineout, that English flyhalf Alan Old stood more than  from the scrumhalf."]}, {"page": "Morn\u00e9 du Plessis", "response": ["In 1974 the Springboks faced the touring British Lions, who swept through South Africa without a loss. Winning 19 of their 20 matches on South African soil (plus one in Namibia and another in Rhodesia), the Lions drew only in the last test match, 13-all. Along the way they smashed the hapless South Western Districts 97\u20130 at the Van Riebeeck Ground, with J. J. Williams scoring 6 tries, and Alan Old converting 15 times.
