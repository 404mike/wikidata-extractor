He was part of the team that performed the first kidney transplantation in the Arab world in 2003, during the Iraq War, and later developed a kidney transplant technique using an unusually small incision. The procedure was depicted in Henry Ward's 2010 painting The 'Finger-Assisted' Nephrectomy of Professor Nadey Hakim', commissioned to raise awareness of legal organ donations. Subsequently, in 2013, he performed the first kidney transplantation in Abuja, Nigeria.\nFollowing an 'unfair' dismissal by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in 2015, he was reinstated in 2016 after a tribunal.

A microsurgeon on the team, Earl Owen from Australia, was privy to the detailed basic research, much of it unpublished, that had been carefully gathered by the team in Louisville. After the operation, Hallam wasn't comfortable with the idea of his transplanted hand and failed to follow the prescribed post-operative drug and physiotherapy regime. His inaccurate expectations became a vivid example of the necessity of a fully committed team of caregivers, including psychologists, that can correctly select and prepare the potential transplant recipients for the lengthy and difficult recovery and for the modest functional restoration of a transplanted hand to be expected.
