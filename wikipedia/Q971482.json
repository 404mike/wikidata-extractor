On 20 September she was anchored in Algoa Bay with the 16-gun sloop . Both captains, Lee of Camel and Samuel Gooch of Rattlesnake, were onshore with a number of their men, supporting the army. At 4 pm a strange sail was seen approaching the bay, flying the Danish flag. The ship entered the bay and approached the British ships, where upon it was approached by a guard boat from Camel, who planned to board her. As they approached, the British sailors saw armed men aboard and realised the ship was a large frigate; they immediately returned to Camel. A British privateer schooner, Surprise, had also passed by the strange ship, and discovered she was a French frigate. Surprise sailed for Rattlesnake to report this. With Lee and Gooch ashore, command devolved to First Lieutenant William Fothergill of Rattlesnake. After warning shots fired from both Camel and Rattlesnake elicited no response, both ships prepared for action. By 8.30 pm the French frigate, which was the 40-gun Preneuse under Captain Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite, had manoeuvred close to Rattlesnake. Fothergill fired a broadside at her, supported by Camel, and a general action broke out. The ships exchanged fire for over three hours, with Preneuse concentrating her fire on Camel, until having sustained a shot below the waterline and having six feet of water in the hold, Camels crew were forced to abandon the guns to work the pumps."]}, {"page": "Dutch Cape Colony", "response": ["|Francis Dundas (1st time) ", "|Francis Dundas (2nd time)"]}, {"page": "1824 in Scotland", "response": ["* 15 January \u2013 Francis Dundas, British Army general and governor of Cape Colony (born c.1759)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Port Louis", "response": ["In September 1799 Sercey dispersed his remaining ships.
