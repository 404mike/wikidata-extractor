Fans chose two inaugural players; Peter Wright and record appearance holder Micky Cook. Wright had previously been named as Colchester United's \"Player of the Century\" by Colchester's Gazette newspaper in 2000. A committee decided on a further three players to join the Hall of Fame in the same season, with Brian Hall, Mark Kinsella and Tony English chosen. New inductees have been announced most seasons since 2007, with the entire team that famously defeated Leeds United in the FA Cup in 1971 entered into the Hall of Fame. The manager of that team, Dick Graham was inducted as the first manager to the Hall of Fame in November 2007.

In two seasons and under two different managers, Ian Atkins and Roy McDonough, Barrett became a dependable ever-present, making 84 Conference appearances during his two years with the U's. He will be best remembered for his time at Colchester by achieving the rare feat of scoring a goal during a top-of-the-table game against promotion-rivals Wycombe Wanderers at Adams Park in September 1991, a goal which secured an 89th minute 2\u20131 win and later proved to crucial as Colchester topped the table at the end of the season on goal difference. He also helped grab an FA Trophy first-round equaliser against Kingstonian after venturing upfield for a late corner, nodding on the ball to assist Tony English, another important contribution as United went on to Wembley to win the trophy and complete a non-league double. With Colchester back in the Football League, the club could not meet Barrett's wage demands, and so he joined Gillingham in August 1992."]}, {"page": "English (surname)", "response": ["*Tony English (born 1966), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Tony English"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Tony English||DF/MF||||Luton||||489||58|| Coventry City||24 December 1984||Free transfer", "|align=\"left\"|Tony English"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Tony English||DF/MF||||Luton||||448||55|| Coventry City||24 December 1984||Free transfer", "|align=\"left\"|Tony English", "|align=\"left\"|Tony English"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["The fans frustration at the defensive performances came to a head in the FA Cup first round.
