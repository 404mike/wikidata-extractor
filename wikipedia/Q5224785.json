As commissioning editor there, he encouraged over one hundred drama and documentary film makers to make films inexpensively and often experimentally for late night slots on Channel 4. After a spell as head of production at one of the regional branches of the UK Film Council, he set up Bigger Pictures, his independent television and film production company. His first feature film Exhibit A was released last year. He has a slate of low budget movies and continues to make a variety of television content including male-skewed programs for Channel Five.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vids", "response": ["Series 1 & 2 was directed by Darren Bender."]}, {"page": "Bender (surname)", "response": ["* Darren Bender, known in the UK TV industry for launching several long running new filmmaker initiatives"]}, {"page": "Exhibit A (film)", "response": ["Exhibit A is a 2007 British independent psychological  thriller film directed by Dom Rotheroe and produced by Darren Bender for Warp Films.
