He's best known for the Eurodance hit singles \"Take Away the Colour\", \"Think About the Way\" \"and \"It's a Rainy Day\".  The Ice MC hits are most notable for being the first songs in the Eurodance genre to blend raggamuffin style rap with female singing choruses. Italian producer and singer Roberto Zanetti (a.k.a. Robyx) and his music team produced the Ice MC hits while simultaneously producing hits for other major '90s artists like Double You, Alexia, and Corona.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ice MC", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ice MC (rapper)"]}, {"page": "IceMC", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ice MC (rapper)"]}, {"page": "List of music artists and bands from England", "response": ["**Ice MC"]}, {"page": "Ice mc", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ice MC (rapper)"]}, {"page": "List of number-one hits of 1994 (Italy)", "response": ["|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|Ice MC "]}, {"page": "ICE MC", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ice MC (rapper)"]}, {"page": "Ian Campbell (artist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ice MC (rapper)"]}, {"page": "Ian Campbell (rapper)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ice MC (rapper)"]}, {"page": "Give Me the Light", "response": ["\"Give Me the Light\" is a 1996 song recorded by British, Italy based Eurodance artist Ice MC, featuring vocals by Italian singer Valentina Ducros.
