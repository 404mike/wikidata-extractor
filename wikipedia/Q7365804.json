In the opening game on 23 September 1964, West Ham won 1\u20130 in Belgium thanks to a headed Ronnie Boyce goal from an Alan Sealey corner. In the home leg, West Ham fans paid record match receipts to see what was described as a \"decrepit performance which brought jeers from the crowd\". Martin Peters scored an own goal for La Gentoise before Johnny Byrne scored an equalizer from a cross by Johnny Sissons In the second round, West Ham drew Czech side Sparta Prague. The first leg on 25 November contained considerable time-wasting by the Czechs including four times when the ball was kicked clean out of the ground. The match was decided in the second half by a 25-yard shot from full-back, John Bond, his first for three years and Alan Sealey, who scored after his shot had hit the post. In the second leg, on 9 December 1964, Sissons put West Ham 3\u20130 up on aggregate only for Prague's Gust\u00e1v Mr\u00e1z to score two late goals to finish the tie 3\u20132 in favour of West Ham. The quarter-finals matched West Ham against Swiss side Lausanne. In the first leg in Switzerland, Brian Dear, playing in his first European game scored the first goal, Byrne the second before Lausanne scored in the 80th minute through Robert Hosp. The second leg, described as a \"thrilling cup-tie\" took place at the Boleyn Ground on 23 March 1965. Two goals from Dear, one from Peters and an own goal from Lausanne's Ely Tacchella gave West Ham an aggregate 6\u20134 win. The Lausanne goals were scored by Pierre Kerkhoffs, Hertig and Norbert Eschmann. The semi-finals West Ham played Spanish side, Real Zaragoza. In the first leg in London, West Ham scored two first-half goals through Dear and Byrne. They attempted to defend their lead in the second half by playing nine in defence but conceded a 55th goal scored by Can\u00e1rio. The second leg in Spain finished as a 1\u20131 draw with goals from Sissons and Zaragoza's Carlos Lapetra. Zaragoza were denied three penalty appeals and blamed the referee for their defeat. The final against West German side 1860 Munich was played at Wembley on 19 May 1965 in front of 100,000 spectators. It has been described as \"West Ham's greatest moment\". Alan Sealey scored in the 69th and 71st minute, the first from an \"impossible angle\" and the second after Bobby Moore's free-kick was not cleared by the Munich defence. Manager Greenwood, in his 1984 book Yours Sincerely, noted the significant roles played by Sealey, Dear and Bobby Moore in the final but also praised West Ham's defence, particularly the efforts of goalkeeper Jim Standen and defender Jack Burkett."]}]}}
