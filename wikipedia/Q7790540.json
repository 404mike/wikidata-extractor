Initially the alkali necessary for the production of soap would have been made from natural sources, such as kelp. However by 1830 it was manufactured synthetically by the Leblanc process.Vardy, Peter I.

At this time there were very few Methodists in the town.  However, largely due to his influence, the movement grew and in 1827 it was sufficiently prosperous to build a substantial chapel, Brunswick Chapel, in the town.  All four sons were influential in the Methodist movement in the town, in particular Thomas Hazlehurst junior.  In addition to his chapel duties, Thomas Hazlehurst junior wrote and distributed free of charge a large number of sermons.  He also paid, wholly or substantially, for the building of some 11-12 Methodist chapels and 2-3 schools in Widnes, Runcorn and the villages of north Cheshire, including Frodsham and Kingsley.  He was frequently invited to lay the foundation stones of Wesleyan chapels and schools.

At the time there were problems in the parish, in particular there was little financial provision for the outlying townships and the fabric of the parish church of St Laurence was in a bad condition.  To make matters worse, the church stood in an elevated position above the town, making access difficult.  Cotton sank into a state of apathy and despondence, and in the autumn of 1865 he was admitted for several weeks to Manor House Asylum, Chiswick, an asylum, under the care of Dr Seymour Tuke.  There was some improvement in his mental condition and by 1870 Cotton was making arrangements for the restoration of the parish church.  At this time there was competition from other denominations, particularly the Wesleyan Methodists.  Financed by Thomas Hazlehurst, a member of the family business of Hazlehurst & Sons, soap and alkali manufacturers of nearby Runcorn, one small chapel had already been built near the parish church and another chapel, larger and more splendid, was planned for the centre of town.  Cotton organised the building of a temporary chapel of ease in the middle of the town.  This was constructed of iron (and known as the Iron Church) and was erected in a very short time on land donated by the Marquess of Cholmondeley.  In addition to restoring the parish church, Cotton began to organise the restoration of the vicarage, in autumn 1872 hiring John Douglas to draw up plans.  He also employed Douglas to design a house for him to live in while the vicarage was being renovated. Cotton successfully improved the provision of church schools in his parish. During his ministry he took boys from his parish to various events, both locally and to Manchester and Liverpool."]}]}}
