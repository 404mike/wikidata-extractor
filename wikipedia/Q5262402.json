To make ends meet, they do a musical commercial for a range of frozen foods called \"Wonder Woman\", whose brand image is that of female liberation\u2014though this comes in the consumerist form of microwave ready meals. Moon knows an established rock star called Stevie Streeter (Tim Curry), and arranges for the band to meet him with a view to becoming his support act. Streeter's act is described as \"sub-Springsteen concept rock\", but the reality is far worse. Streeter prevents the Little Ladies from getting any sound check or rehearsal time, resulting in their sounding abysmal on their opening tour night with Streeter. This turns out to be a standard tactic to avoid the support act from upstaging the main act. In the end, however, they manage to get their sound and act together on subsequent nights, and start to become a success. Streeter is worried that they are \"taking his energy\", and in a paranoid drunken rage, tries to kick them off the tour. His management, loud American Kitty Schreiber (Beth Porter) and David Maxwell (Gregory Floy), have other ideas, and after seeing the Little Ladies live, decide to sign them up as an act in their own right.
