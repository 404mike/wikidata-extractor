After travelling  on student expeditions Iceland, the Himalayas, and the Canary Islands, he served in Palestine and Egypt as a tank officer. Subsequently he obtained a position in Tanganyika, and in the Game Department in 1953 he designed methods of estimating game densities that are still widely used. He applied these to studies of food sources of Tsetse flies (specifically Glossina swynnertoni) in Kenya.In 1975 he prepared a United Nations Environment Programme report on desertification in the African Sahel region, in which he concluded that \"the desert southern boundary has shifted south\" by an average of 90 to 100 kilometres (56 to 62 mi) in the preceding 17 years. This statement has been instrumental to the belief that desertification is a great threat to the world and especially Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["* Hugh Lamprey (1928\u20131996), British ecologist and bush pilot who developed methods for estimating game densities in Africa"]}, {"page": "List of ecologists", "response": ["* Hugh Lamprey (UK)"]}, {"page": "List of British scientists", "response": ["* Hugh Lamprey (1928\u20131996), ecologist"]}, {"page": "Lamprey (surname)", "response": ["*Hugh Lamprey (1928\u20131996), British ecologist and bush pilot"]}, {"page": "Tony Sinclair (biologist)", "response": ["Sinclair spent his early childhood in the African bush in Tanzania, where his love for Africa and animals led him to study for degrees in zoology at Pembroke College, Oxford.
