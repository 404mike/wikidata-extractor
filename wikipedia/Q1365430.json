The actress Dawn O'Day who played Shirley in the 1934 film adaption of Anne of Green Gables liked the character so much she legally changed her name to Anne Shirley. Montgomery during her youth had experiences of what she called \"the flash\"-moments of quiet contemplation of the beauty of nature when she was walking alone that gave her emotional ecstasy and what she regarded as the awareness of a higher spiritual power running through nature and her.Brennan, Joseph Gerard \"The Story of a Classic: Anne and After\" pages 247-256 from The American Scholar, Spring 1995 page 252.
