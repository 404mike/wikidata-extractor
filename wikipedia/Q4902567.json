Tobias formed Trees in 1969 with Celia Humphris on vocals, Barry Clarke on lead guitar, Unwin Brown on drums/vocals, and David Costa on acoustic guitar & dulcimer.  Bias sang and played bass, guitar and piano on their two CBS albums, The Garden of Jane Delawney (1970) and On the Shore (1971), and wrote much of their material. On the Shore was remastered in January 2007 and re released on CD.\nAfter the original group broke up in the early 1970s, Boshell worked with Kiki Dee, writing her hit songs \"I've Got the Music in Me\" and \"First Thing in the Morning,\" among others.\nIn the 1980s, Boshell became a guest musician for Barclay James Harvest, touring and recording with them. In 1987 he moved on to The Moody Blues, becoming their lead keyboard player after the departure of Patrick Moraz in 1991. He stayed with the Moody Blues until their 2001 tour. He has also recorded with Sheena Easton, Kevin Ayers, Beverley Craven, Chris Farlowe, and Duane Eddy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Moody Blues", "response": ["Despite his diminished participation in the recording process, Thomas' high value remained evident on stage primarily from his continued ability to sing out his 1960s and 1970s Moodies classics, and also in flute and keyboard duets he composed with Moraz which were performed only during Moodies' concerts. The band reinforced its concert sound in 1986 with the addition of a second keyboardist. Bias Boshell was the first, replaced in 1987 by Guy Allison before Boshell returned by 1990.

Lacking a singer, Costa suggested they audition the sister of an acquaintance of his and introduced Celia Humphris into the mix, who had just left Arts Educational where she had studied dance, drama and singing.

On The Shore featured cover artwork by Storm Thorgerson of the Hipgnosis studio. Like other folk contemporaries, Trees was compared with Fairport Convention, but regarded as delivering with a more psychedelic edge. The group's material was divided between adaptations of traditional songs and original compositions, primarily by Bias Boshell.  In a 2020 interview, Costa commented: \"We got labelled as a folk-rock band, full stop, but our influences were generally far more American than British.\"", "Following the demise of the original lineup, Bias Boshell went on to work as a keyboard player and songwriter with The Kiki Dee Band, writing her hit song I've Got the Music in Me, before joining Barclay James Harvest and subsequently The Moody Blues, replacing keyboard player Patrick Moraz.
