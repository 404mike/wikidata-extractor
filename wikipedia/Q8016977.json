Their only son, also called James, was born two months before his father's death and became the 8th Baronet. A sickly child, he died on 14 September 1805 just short of his eleventh birthday, and the great estates of the Long, Child and Tylney families devolved chiefly onto the eldest of the 7th Baronet's three daughters, Catherine. The Baronetcy became extinct and Catherine's marriage to spendthrift, high-stakes gambler and adulterous William Pole-Tylney-Long-Wellesley, 4th Earl of Mornington saw the destruction of Wanstead House, Wanstead, Essex (now London), but also produced their son who settled the remaining estates on his first cousin the 2nd Duke of Wellington."]}]}}
