He entered Gray's Inn in 1789, a pupil of Samuel Romilly, and was called to the bar in 1792. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1797, became a bencher of Gray's Inn in 1813 and became King's Counsel in 1816.\nDespite being a notoriously poor speaker, he attained distinction as an equity lawyer at the Court of Chancery. Lord Eldon called him the best equity lawyer in England, though he could \"neither read, write, walk, nor talk\". Bell gave extended evidence to the Chancery Commissioners in 1824\u20135, and published Thoughts on Alterations in the Court of Chancery in 1830. Amongst his professional pupils was Henry Bickersteth, later Master of the Rolls and created Lord Langdale.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1824.He died in 1836 at his home in Bedford Square, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Bell", "response": ["John Bell may refer to:", "*John Bell (Australian actor) (born 1940), Australian actor and director", "*John Bell (musician) (born 1962), American guitarist and lead singer for Widespread Panic", "*John Bell (radio personality) (born 1934), American disc jockey", "*John Bell (Scottish actor) (born 1997), Scottish actor", "*John Bell (sculptor) (1812\u20131895), British sculptor", "*John Bell Jr. (artist) (1937\u20132013), American painter and sculptor", "*John Bell (special effects artist), Academy Award nominated special effects artist", "*John Bell (fl.1413), MP for Lincolnshire", "*John Bell (MP for Leominster) (by 1508\u201333/44), MP for Leominster", "*John Bell (by 1514 \u2013 1543 or later), MP for Winchelsea", "*John Bell (by 1508-59 or later), MP for Reading", "*John Bell (barrister) (1764\u20131836), English barrister", "*John Bell (legal scholar), professor of law and Fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge", "*John Bell (British politician) (1809\u20131851), Member of Parliament from Thirsk", "*John Bell (Florida politician) (1916\u20131982), American politician, Florida State Representative and State Senator", "*John Bell (New Hampshire politician) (1765\u20131836), American politician, state governor", "*John Bell (Ohio politician) (1796\u20131869), U.S. Representative, mayor of two cities in Ohio, probate judge", "*John Bell (Tennessee politician) (1796\u20131869), U.S. House Speaker, Secretary of War, Senator, and presidential candidate", "*John Bell (Virginia politician) (born 1963), member of the Virginia State Senate", "*John Bell (Wisconsin politician), Wisconsin State Assemblyman", "*John Bell (publisher) (1745\u20131831), English publisher", "*John Bell (folk music) (1783\u20131864), English folk song collector", "*John Bell (traveller) (1691\u20131780), Scottish traveller and author", "*John Bell (historian) (born 1952), Canadian archivist and comic book historian", "*John Bell (bishop of Worcester) (died 1556), English clergyman", "*John Bell (bishop of Mayo) (died 1541)", "*John Bell (1788\u20131855), Wesleyan minister from England who came to Newfoundland", "*John Bell (priest) (died 1591), priest and academic", "*John Bell (surgeon) (1763\u20131820), Scottish anatomist and surgeon", "*John Bell (physician) (born 1952), British\u2013Canadian biologist", "*John Bell (Australian footballer) (1886\u20131917), Australian footballer killed during World War I", "*John Bell (cricketer, born 1895) (1895\u20131974), English cricketer", "*John Bell (English footballer) (1919\u20131994), English football full back", "*John Bell (1920s Scottish footballer), former Scottish football striker", "*John Bell (1930s Scottish footballer), former Scottish football forward", "*John Bell Jr. (footballer) (born 1949), former Australian rules footballer", "*John Bell (bowls) (born 1947), former British bowler", "*John Bell (Australian cricketer) (born 1949), Australian cricketer", "*John Bell (field hockey) (born 1933), British Olympic hockey player", "*John Bell (artillerist) (1747\u20131798), English artillerist", "*John Bell (British Army officer) (1782\u20131876), British general and Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey", "*John Bell (explorer) (c. 1799\u20131868), Canadian explorer and Hudson's Bay Company governor", "*John Bell (farmer) (1750\u20131820), central figure in the Bell Witch ghost story of southern American folklore", "*John Bell Farm, listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in eastern Chester County, Pennsylvania", "*John Bell Hood (1831\u20131879), Confederate general during the American Civil War", "*John Bell Young (1953\u20132017), American musician and critic"]}, {"page": "John Dawson (surgeon)", "response": ["For over twenty years Dawson maintained his medical practice while also pursuing his work as a mathematician, and it was only from about 1790 that he devoted himself exclusively to mathematical teaching. By then his fame as a teacher was attracting a regular stream of pupils, including Cambridge undergraduates who read with him during the long vacation and others who were preparing for entry to the university. For a fee of about 5 shillings a week for unlimited tuition, in addition to the cost of accommodation and food, sometimes in Dawson's house but more commonly in a local inn, pupils were taught in a characteristic peripatetic fashion. As Adam Sedgwick, who read with him in 1804 before going up to Cambridge and subsequently during vacations, recalled, Dawson would seat his pupils, often a dozen or more, at tables about the house and move constantly from one to another, correcting and advising. Dawson's method achieved remarkable results. Between 1781 and 1794, at least seven, possibly eight, of the fourteen senior wranglers at Cambridge had been taught by him, as had four others between 1797 and 1807. Among these were the future chancery barrister John Bell, the Arabist John Palmer, the lawyer and anti-slavery campaigner Thomas Harrison, James Inman, who went on to become professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and George Butler, later headmaster of Harrow and dean of Peterborough, whose vivid account of the journey of almost five days between London and Sedbergh and his introduction to Dawson was published in The Sedberghian for December 1881. Pupils who went on to Cambridge and did not achieve the rank of senior wrangler included, in addition to Richard and Adam Sedgwick and Haygarth, the lord chief justice Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, the mathematician Miles Bland, who was at Sedbergh School, and several bishops. Among those whose medical interests took them to Edinburgh rather than Cambridge were Robert Willan, Thomas Garnett, and George Birkbeck.", "He died, on 19 September 1820, and a monument high in the nave of St Andrew's Church in Sedbergh was erected, in the form of a bust of him by Robert William Sievier, with an inscription, dated August 1825, by his former pupil John Bell."]}, {"page": "Henry Bickersteth, 1st Baron Langdale", "response": ["Having taken his degree, Bickersteth was immediately elected a fellow of his college, and thereupon made up his mind to enter the profession of the law.

That same year he created a park opposite to the vicarage similar to The Backs of Cambridge, built a replica of Trinity College Bridge, dammed the stream and opened springs to form a lake which was used for ice skating in the winter. In September 1801 he married Margaret Cradock (11 June 1776 \u2013 20 January 1854) at the church in Gilling West in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Margaret was the eldest daughter of Sheldon Cradock of Hartforth who was the lord of the manor of Lax's home village of Ravensworth. Lax was a proposer of Robert Woodhouse, Henry Coddington, Herbert Marsh and John Bell for Royal Society fellowship, the latter being one of Lax's closest friends, and he was a keen supporter of George Biddell Airy throughout Airy's career. Lax was a chief supporter of the Whig John Romilly, 1st Baron Romilly's parliamentary bid.
