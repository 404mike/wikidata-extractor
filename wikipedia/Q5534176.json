This drew a new, large audience to the series, and new attention to the author, as well as positive reviews such as in Library Journal, Publishers Weekly, and one by Richard Snow in the New York Times shown above. Novels prior to this were published rapidly in the US for that new market. Following novels were released at the same time by the UK and US publishers. Collins (name of UK publisher in that year) asked Geoff Hunt in 1988 to do the cover art for the twelve books published by then, with The Letter of Marque being the first book to have Hunt's work on the first edition. He continued to paint the covers for future books; the covers were used on both USA and UK editions. Reissues of earlier novels used the Geoff Hunt covers."]}, {"page": "Blue at the Mizzen", "response": ["* Geoff Hunt Covers for the Aubrey-Maturin series"]}, {"page": "HMS Agamemnon (1781)", "response": ["The historical novelist Patrick O'Brian selected Agamemnon as one of the ships on which Jack Aubrey served as lieutenant, before the events of Master and Commander, the first novel in his Aubrey\u2013Maturin series.O'Brian, Patrick (1996).

She can be seen at least partially in paintings of the battle by Clarkson Frederick Stanfield, John Christian Schetky, Nicholas Pocock, Thomas Buttersworth and Thomas Whitcombe. A fictionalized depiction of her launch was produced by Philip Burgoyne. Later representations of the retired Temeraire were also popular. Though no known contemporary image of her in the prison ship role exists, she was painted while a guardship on the Medway in 1833 by Edward William Cooke, and by William Beatson and J. J. Williams while laid up at Rotherhithe in 1838. More recently she has been the subject of paintings by Geoff Hunt. The most famous painting of Temeraire was made by J. M. W. Turner and titled The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up, 1838. Turner depicts Temeraire on her last voyage, towed up the Thames by a small black steam tug as the sun sets (or dawns). In choosing his title Turner created an enduring appellation, as previously she had been known to her crew as the \"saucy\" Temeraire. Turner presented it for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1839 with an accompanying excerpt, slightly altered, of Thomas Campbell's poem Ye Mariners of England."]}, {"page": "The Final Unfinished Voyage of Jack Aubrey", "response": ["On the dust jacket of 21, the back includes an appreciation of O'Brian from Geoff Hunt, who drew covers for the 20 completed books of the series as well as for 21, beneath a monochrome drawing of a sailing ship."]}, {"page": "Hampton School", "response": ["* Geoff Hunt (1959\u201366), former president of the Royal Society of Marine Artists "]}, {"page": "Geoff Hunt", "response": ["Geoff Hunt on Squash (London: Cassell) 1977."]}, {"page": "Conway Publishing", "response": ["* The Marine Art of Geoff Hunt, Geoff Hunt (2004) ", "* Geoff Hunt"]}, {"page": "Testimonies (novel)", "response": ["In 1994 the UK version was renamed Testimonies and re-published by HarperCollins with new cover art by Geoff Hunt, the cover-artist for the re-issued volumes of the Aubrey\u2013Maturin series.
