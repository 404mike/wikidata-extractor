Swayne spent his Resident years in a peripatetic way, moving from island to island, by whatever commercial or naval vessels, returning to Suva or Sydney when necessary. He faced a severe drought in the southern Gilberts, rendering impossible to collect the new capitation in those southernmost islands. He also faced the claims from traders, especially in Butaritari, all that reinforced suspicions of the Colonial Office that the protectorate had been an error.", "link_mentions": {}}}
