Anderson, with Shakespeare's Walk in the book, almost equals Bewick, according to Ernest Radford writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, and his treatment of foliage is reminiscent of the prints in Robert Bloomfield's Farmer's Boy, where the first edition of 1800 notes \"with ornaments engraved by Anderson.\" These wood-engravings have been erroneously ascribed to Bewick."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Gwillim (bird artist)", "response": ["It is unclear where Gwillim\u2019s inspiration to start painting the birds of Madras began, other than a clear and focused interest within herself. She and her sister Mary very likely received basic drawing instructions from their artistic father, and from their letters we know that they later trained under George Samuel, whom they often mention. Samuel painted primarily landscapes in both watercolours and oils, and his influence may be visible in Gwillim\u2019s work.", "There exists a great deal of variation within Gwillim\u2019s paintings of birds, and thus a singular \u201cstyle\u201d is difficult to characterize. However there are different categories into which her paintings can be sorted and a few consistent traits visible in all. Of the 121 known paintings, held in the Blacker Wood Natural History collection at the McGill University Library, 56 have full backgrounds, 26 of the paintings have limited backgrounds, and 39 of the paintings have no background at all. The fully realized backgrounds contain features such as palm trees, distant mountains, and occasionally buildings such as temples. The limited backgrounds contain rocks or branches with some foliage contoured closely to the body of the bird. The paintings that have no backgrounds are perhaps unfinished, or may be the victims of Gwillim\u2019s constant shortage of art supplies. The availability of paper, paints, and brushes was subject to the inconsistencies of ocean travel from England to Madras, and Gwillim herself notes that if she were to paint all her backgrounds in the style of her teacher George Samuel, she would run out of colours to do so even faster.Elizabeth Gwillim to Hester James, March 18, 1802. British Library, India Office Records, Mss.Eur.C.240/1, ff. 49r-54v. Gwillim painted the birds themselves first, and the backgrounds second."]}, {"page": "Samuel, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Samuel"]}, {"page": "Mary Symonds", "response": ["The Madras and Environs Album (The South Asia Collection, Norwich) is an album of 78 watercolours of India, including landscapes, urban scenes, and depictions of local individuals.
