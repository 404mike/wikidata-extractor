By March 31, 1901, he was serving as a seaman on the USS Petrel (PG-2). On that day, he helped rescue several crewmates during a fire on the ship. For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor a year later, on March 22, 1902.Cahey's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n\nOn board the U.S.S. Petrel for heroism and gallantry, fearlessly exposing his own life to danger in saving others on the occasion of the fire on board that vessel, 31 March 1901.\nCahey reached the rank of chief gunner's mate before leaving the Navy. He died at age 64 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "USS Petrel (PG-2)", "response": ["When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him.

The sail room was a small compartment in the bottom of the ship, adjacent to the magazine and was accessible only by a hatchway from the berth deck above. Several members of the ship's crew, led by the ship's captain, Lieutenant Commander Jesse M. Roper took turns entering the compartment and fighting the blaze. The fire produced no visible flames but thick, acrid smoke and fumes filled the area. The sail room was also pitch black; the ship's electric generator had been turned off at dawn, and no other lamps would work in the harsh atmosphere of the compartment. A number of men, including Roper, were overcome by the bad air and were pulled out of the sail room semi-conscious. As the fumes grew thicker and more noxious, Roper ordered everyone out of the compartment, but one sailor, Seaman Patrick Toner, did not emerge from the room. When a sound was heard from below, believed to be Toner fighting for breath, four men descended to rescue him, including Roper (not fully recovered from his first trip below).
