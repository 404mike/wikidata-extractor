He began a medicine degree at Edinburgh, but suffered from ill health, prompting him to break his studies and visit Australia. He spent two years in Melbourne before returning to Edinburgh to complete his degree. He then undertook post-graduate studies at Glasgow, W\u00fcrzburg and Vienna.\nHe returned to Australia in 1877 as a medical officer on a migrant ship. He practiced medicine in Melbourne for 15 years, but again ill health prompted him to travel. He visited the South Seas and spend some time living in the New Hebrides, where he collected plants for Ferdinand von Mueller.\nAfter returning to Australia, he was appointed the first Government Botanist of Western Australia, holding the position from 1897 to 1906. He produced few papers during this time, but these were considered high quality work. Plant taxa published by him include Acacia densiflora, Acacia longispinea, Angianthus acrohyalinus (hook-leaf angianthus), Calandrinia creethae, Calandrinia schistorhiza, Drosera bulbigena (midget sundew), Drosera occidentalis (western sundew), and Indigofera boviperda. He also collected numerous specimens; for example he collected the type specimens for Eucalyptus ebbanoensis and E. platycorys.\nMorrison was retrenched in 1906, thereupon returning to medical practice. In 1912 he was appointed assistant botanist to Alfred Ewart at the National Herbarium of Victoria. He died at Cheltenham, Victoria the following year. He bequeathed his herbarium to Edinburgh University, his library to the University of Tasmania, and the remainder of his estate to the University of Melbourne.\nAlexander Morrison National Park is named in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Morrison National Park", "response": ["Alexander Morrison National Park is a national park in Western Australia, located  north of Perth in the Shire of Coorow along the Green Head-Coorow Road.

In 1906 the Department of Agriculture handed its herbarium over to the Museum, but reclaimed it in 1911. The \"forest herbarium\" commenced in 1916. Around 1928, the Government took the decision to amalgamate the three into a single State Herbarium, to be managed by the Department of Agriculture. The \"forest herbarium\" was handed over more or less immediately, but the Museum was opposed to the merger, and did not finally hand over its specimens until around 1959. In 1988 departmental responsibility was shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Conservation and Land Management, the Department of Parks and Wildlife, and now the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions."]}, {"page": "Banksia wonganensis", "response": ["Early collections of B.\u00a0wonganensis include specimens collected by Alexander Morrison at Wongan Hills in October 1903, by Norm Moyle in Monk Well Gully, Wongan Hills, by Fred Lullfitz northwest of Wongan Hills, and by Kenneth Newbey in the Wongan Hills. In 1985 these specimens were wrongly attributed to Dryandra hewardiana (now Banksia hewardiana) by Robert Malcolm Sainsbury in his Field Guide to Dryandras, but it was later recognised as a distinct species, and referred to in FloraBase as Dryandra sp. 25. The type specimen was collected by Alex George on 4 August 1986, from a location on Piawaning Road north-west of Wongan Hills. George published a formal description of the species in 1996 in Nuytsia 10(3). He placed it in the genus Dryandra, subgenus Dryandra, series Armatae, and gave it the specific epithet \"wonganensis\" from \"wongan\", after the Wongan Hills where it is found, and the Latin \"ensis\" (origin or place).

In 1996, Alex George declared these two names to refer to the same plant, since Gandoger distinguished them only by the width of the leaves, the number of leaf teeth, and the length of the flower head, all of which are quite variable in this variety. He adopted the epithet cygnorum, demoting it to a variety of D.\u00a0sessilis.
