Stanley Cohen, who originated the term moral panic, called the episode \"one of the purest cases of moral panic.\" The initial investigations of SRA were performed by anthropologists and sociologists, who failed to find evidence of SRA actually occurring; instead they concluded that SRA was a result of rumors and folk legends that were spread by \"media hype, Christian fundamentalism, mental health and law enforcement professionals and child abuse advocates.\" Sociologists and journalists noted the vigorous nature with which some evangelical activists and groups were using claims of SRA to further their religious and political goals. Other commentators suggested that the entire phenomenon may be evidence of a moral panic over Satanism and child abuse. Skeptical explanations for allegations of SRA have included an attempt by radical feminists to undermine the nuclear family, a backlash against working women, homophobic attacks on gay childcare workers, a universal need to believe in evil, fear of alternative spiritualities, \"end of the millennium\" anxieties, or a transient form of temporal lobe epilepsy."]}, {"page": "Moral panic", "response": ["Stanley Cohen, who developed the term, states that moral panic happens when \"a condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests.\" While the issues identified may be real, the claims \"exaggerate the seriousness, extent, typicality and/or inevitability of harm.\" The concept of moral panic can now be found in several disciplines, including sociology and criminology, media studies, and cultural studies.", "As a social theory or sociological concept, the concept was first developed in the United Kingdom by Stanley Cohen, who introduced the phrase moral panic in a 1967\u201369 PhD thesis that became the basis for his 1972 book Folk Devils and Moral Panics.

According to Folk Devils and Moral Panics by Stanley Cohen,  the definition can be broken down to many different sections. The sections, which were identified by Erich Goode and Nachman Ben-Yehuda in 1994, include concern, hostility, consensus, disproportionality, and volatility. Concern, which is not to be mistaken with fear, is about the possible or potential threat. Hostility occurs when an outrage occurs toward the people who were a part of the problem and agencies who are accountable. These people are seen as the enemy since their behavior is viewed as a danger to society. Consensus includes a distributed agreement that an actual threat is going to take place. This is where the media and other sources come in to aid in spreading of the panic. Disproportionality compares people's reactions to the actual seriousness of the condition. Volatility is when there is no longer any more panic.", "The media plays a crucial part in delivering social reaction. According to Stanley Cohen, there are three processes that the media expresses: Exaggeration and distortion, prediction, and symbolization.", "Angela McRobbie and Sarah Thornton claim that Stanley Cohen's work on moral panic is outdated and argue that more modern information is required.
