Born in London, he studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama under Bantock Pierrepoint. He recorded under his own name and as variously Richard Condor, William Duncan, Harry Durrant, Robert Durrant, Ernest Gray, Bobby Gray, Robert Oswald, and perhaps some others. \nHis recording repertoire was varied ranging from popular songs of the day, sentimental songs, hymns and sacred songs, British patriotic songs (particularly during the First World War) as well as Classical music, most notably a complete recording of Gounod's Faust in 1929 under Sir Thomas Beecham under the Columbia label. He also took part in recordings of several Gilbert and Sullivan operettas as well as Edward German's Merrie England under the direction of Joe Batten. Shortly after the Titanic disaster in 1912 he recorded two songs (on both sides of the same record), \"Stand by your Post\" and \"Be British\" in memory of the victims. The proceeds from the record's sales went towards helping the victims' families. This was one of the earliest examples of producing recordings to raise funds for charitable causes and it is one that has been continued in subsequent years, most notably with Live Aid in the 1980s and Bob Geldof's record Feed the World to raise money for victims of the Ethiopia Famine in 1984. This was the continuation of a tradition that had its origins with Robert Carr's Titanic record. During the First World War (where he served in the British Army) he recorded a number of songs as part of the recruiting effort and to bolster morale, most notably \"We Must All Fall In\" and \"Laddie in Khaki\", composed by Ivor Novello.\nIn addition to being a recording, concert and opera singer, Robert Carr was also a leading figure with concert parties which provided light entertainment at British holiday resorts in the years before the Second World War. He owned one such party called the Georgians.\nDuring the Second World War, Robert Carr worked for ENSA, an organisation which provided entertainment for British servicemen serving in the war. After the war, he also taught singing at his old music college, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.\nHe died in Essex, England on 20 November 1948. The detective novelist Antony Carr was his son and Australian newsreader Susannah Carr his granddaughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Carr (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Carr (1916\u20132012) was a British Conservative politician.", "Robert Carr may also refer to:", "* Robert Carr (MP for Boston) (c. 1511\u20131590), MP for Boston 1559", "* Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset (c. 1587\u20131645), Scottish politician", "* Sir Robert Carr, 3rd Baronet, British politician, Privy Counsellor of England, MP for Lincolnshire 1665\u20131685", "* Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Ancram (c. 1578\u20131654), Scottish nobleman and writer", "* Sir Robert Carr, Kt., English officer who secured the surrender of Fort Cassimir, New Netherland in 1664", "* Robert Carr (bishop) (1774\u20131841), English churchman, bishop of Chichester, 1824, and bishop of Worcester, 1831", "* Robert Carr (baritone) (1881\u20131948), English baritone singer and recording artist", "* Milton Robert Carr (born 1943), commonly known as Bob Carr, American politician, U.S. Representative from Michigan", "* Robert Carr (programmer) (born 1956), American computer programmer", "* Robert Carr (activist) (1963\u20132011), Trinidadian scholar and human rights activist"]}, {"page": "Muriel Brunskill", "response": ["Her other recordings include Gounod's Faust, with Harold Williams, Robert Carr, and Robert Easton, conducted by Clarence Raybould; Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music, with Lilian Stiles-Allen, Isobel Baillie, Elsie Suddaby, Eva Turner, Margaret Balfour, Astra Desmond, Mary Jarred, Parry Jones, Heddle Nash, Frank Titterton, Walter Widdop, Roy Henderson, Norman Allin, Robert Easton, Harold Williams, the Queen's Hall Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Henry Wood; and John Tor\u00e9's Golden City, original cast recording, with Edmund Purdom, Eleanor Summerfield and Emile Belcourt."]}, {"page": "Susannah Carr", "response": ["Carr was born in England.
