He has worked with a number of bands, including Pulp, Arctic Monkeys, Reverend and The Makers, The Long Blondes, Milburn, Richard Hawley, The Fever Club, The Scaramanga Six, Smokers Die Younger, Monkey Swallows the Universe, The Lodger, Little Man Tate, 65daysofstatic, Little Lost David, Albany, Dead Like Harry,  The Silverfish, The Magi, Dead World Leaders, Little Ze, Jack's Attic, Smiling Ivy, Pink Sharabang and The Hurriers. He works from his own studio in the city, 2fly Studios.Between 1986 and 1992, he was part of the Indie C&W outfit, Don Valley & The Rotherhides (in which all the members were named after areas of Sheffield), whose songs included \"Thatcher's Dead\". He also played guitar and performed backing vocals in the 1990s Sheffield guitar band Seafruit. Seafruit's single \"Looking For Sparks\" was used for a while on Sky Sports' football coverage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pulp (band)", "response": ["The fold was short-lived however. Steve Mackey, a regular at their Sheffield and London gigs, was also studying in London and was asked to join the band as a bass player.Sturdy, p. 172. The line-up now consisted of Cocker, Mackey, Senior, Candida Doyle, Nick Banks (drums). In mid-1989, they began recording another album for Fire, this time with a bigger budget and production from Alan Smyth, called Separations. This was a progression of the style of Freaks, with Leonard Cohen-esque ballads on side one and an acid house infused track-listing on side two. The disparate styles can be attributed to Cocker and Mackey's different and changing tastes; Mackey introduced Cocker to house music which led to them both going to raves, while Cocker introduced Mackey to \"Scott Walker and Serge Gainsbourg\".Sturdy, p. 175. Like Freaks, the release of Separations was delayed, to an extent lessening the potential impact. In the meantime, however, in 1991, a 12\" recording, \"My Legendary Girlfriend\", became music periodical NMEs single of the week. Stuart Maconie described it in his review as \"a throbbing ferment of nightclub soul and teen opera\".Sturdy, p. 190.

Virgin wanted to release it but it was vetoed by Simon Draper of Virgin America over copyright concerns. It was eventually released as a run of 500 white label promotional copies.

That August, while recording a demo with Judan Suki at Sheffield's 2fly Studios, Turner asked Alan Smyth if he would produce an Arctic Monkeys demo. Smyth obliged and \"thought they definitely had something special going on. I told Alex off for singing in an American voice at that first session.\" An introduction by Smyth led to the band acquiring a management team, Geoff Barradale and Ian McAndrew. They paid for Smyth and Arctic Monkeys to record numerous three-song demos in 2003 and 2004. Turner was quiet and observant during studio sessions, remembered Smyth: \"Whenever anyone popped in the studio, he would sit and listen to them before he would say anything.\" At their rehearsal room in Yellow Arch Studios, Arctic Monkeys developed a reputation as particularly hard workers; the owner lent the band touring equipment while the owner's wife helped Turner with his singing. Barradale drove the band around venues in Scotland, the Midlands, and the north of England to establish their reputation as a live band. The band handed out free copies of the demo CDs after each show and fans began sharing the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk demo compilation online. After finishing college in mid-2004, Turner took a year out to focus on the band and deferred vague plans to attend university in Manchester. He began working part-time as a bartender at the Sheffield music venue The Boardwalk. There, he met well-known figures including musician Richard Hawley and poet John Cooper Clarke. By the end of 2004, Arctic Monkeys' audiences were beginning to sing along with their songs and the demo of \"I Bet You Look Good on The Dancefloor\" was played on BBC Radio 1 by Zane Lowe."]}, {"page": "When the Sun Goes Down (Arctic Monkeys song)", "response": ["*Alan Smyth \u2013 additional recording"]}, {"page": "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not", "response": ["* Alan Smyth \u2013 production , additional recording "]}, {"page": "Smyth", "response": ["| Alan Smyth || before 1990 || (living) || EnglishMusic producer"]}, {"page": "Letters and Colours", "response": ["The band's song \"Alpha\" was included in Alt Delete's era defining compilation Digital PenetrationDigital Penetration, Alt-delete.co.uk in 2006.

Like the song, the book's main character is an under-achieving young boy growing up in Yorkshire. The song has received rave reviews, and appeared as Zane Lowe's 'Hottest Record In The World Today', and is equally liked by Radio 1 DJs Nick Grimshaw and Greg James.

The demos were recorded at 2Fly Studios, and produced by Alan Smyth, McClure acknowledges the work Smyth put into the demos by accrediting the debut single; \"Heavyweight Champion of The World\" as McClure/Cosens/Smyth. Reverend and the Makers' music is a mix of indie guitar pop, electronica and a touch of Madchester-esque funk. Some of the internet demos feature members of other notable Sheffield musicians such as Alex Turner (Arctic Monkeys), Tim Hampton (Bromheads Jacket) and Mike Hughes (Little Ze). One of Reverend's inspirations is Manchester performance poet John Cooper Clarke and Reverend often performs his own poems, of a similar style, in between songs during his live sets. One of the B-sides to the debut single \"Heavyweight Champion of the World\" is a poem entitled \"Last Resort\" in which John Cooper Clarke and McClure read alternate stanzas. This poem was also duetted live when the band played live at Shoreditch's Spread Eagle in the first tour in May 2006."]}]}}
