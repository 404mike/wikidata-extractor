It began with the 1948 paper, \"On the Problem of the Molecular Theory of Superconductivity\", where Fritz London proposed that the phenomenological London equations may be consequences of the coherence of a quantum state. In 1953, Brian Pippard, motivated by penetration experiments, proposed that this would modify the London equations via a new scale parameter called the coherence length. John Bardeen then argued in the 1955 paper, \"Theory of the Meissner Effect in Superconductors\", that such a modification naturally occurs in a theory with an energy gap. The key ingredient was Leon Cooper's calculation of the bound states of electrons subject to an attractive force in his 1956 paper, \"Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas\"."]}, {"page": "Cavendish Laboratory", "response": ["The Cavendish Professors were the heads of the department until the tenure of Sir Brian Pippard, during which period the roles separated.", "# Sir Brian Pippard FRS 1971\u20131984", "* Superconductivity Josephson junction, led by Brian Pippard"]}, {"page": "Arrow of time", "response": ["British physicist Sir Alfred Brian Pippard wrote, \"There is thus no justification for the view, often glibly repeated, that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is only statistically true, in the sense that microscopic violations repeatedly occur, but never violations of any serious magnitude.
