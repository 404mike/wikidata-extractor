He bagged a pair in his only appearance against Kent at Dewsbury and did not bowl but did take a catch.  Despite his lack of contribution, Yorkshire ran out comfortable winners by 82 runs, thanks largely to the bowling of Tom Emmett and George Freeman. He also appeared in a Leeds Clarence side in 1872. Dawson played rugby union for both Bradford and Yorkshire (1871-3).\nBorn in Bradford, Yorkshire, England, Dawson died in March 1916, in Ilkley, Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Dawson", "response": ["William Dawson may refer to:", "* William Dawson (diplomat) (1885\u20131972), career United States diplomat", "* William Dawson (Missouri politician) (1848\u20131929), U.S. Representative from Missouri", "* William Dawson (mayor) (1825\u20131901), mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota", "* William Dawson (New Zealand politician) (1852\u20131923), New Zealand politician for Dunedin Suburbs", "* William Dawson (college president) (1704?\u20131752), second president of the College of William & Mary", "* William Dawson (sportsman) (1850\u20131916), English cricketer and rugby union player", "* William Dawson (ornithologist) (1927\u20132020), American ornithologist", "* John William Dawson (1820\u20131899), Canadian geologist and Principal of McGill University"]}, {"page": "William Dawson (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Dawson (sportsman)"]}]}}
