He bagged a pair in his only appearance against Kent at Dewsbury and did not bowl but did take a catch.  Despite his lack of contribution, Yorkshire ran out comfortable winners by 82 runs, thanks largely to the bowling of Tom Emmett and George Freeman. He also appeared in a Leeds Clarence side in 1872. Dawson played rugby union for both Bradford and Yorkshire (1871-3).\nBorn in Bradford, Yorkshire, England, Dawson died in March 1916, in Ilkley, Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
