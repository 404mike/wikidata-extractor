He re-encounters Edward Stanley, now a vicar presiding over a local school in which the local children are taught literacy but also meekness. Despite Edward's compromises and failures - and evident lack of spiritual understanding - William acknowledges his former friend's \"velvet true heart\" and gives him the woomera. William also finds Esther \u2013 long-since married to someone else and the mother of a young man who works as a weaver, selling to the growing local market towns. Esther has named her son after William, but it is strongly implied that his actual father is Edward."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Norwich", "response": ["| 60px Edward Stanley"]}, {"page": "Edward Stanley", "response": ["Edward Stanley may refer to:", "*Edward Stanley, 1st Baron Monteagle (c. 1460\u20131523), English soldier and peer", "*Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby (1509\u20131572), English nobleman", "*Edward Stanley (MP for Merioneth) (by 1513\u201364 or later), MP for Merioneth", "*Edward Stanley (MP for Flint Boroughs) (1521/22?\u20131609), MP for Flint Boroughs", "*Edward Stanley (1639\u20131664), Member of Parliament for Lancashire", "*Edward Stanley, 11th Earl of Derby (1689\u20131776), British peer and politician", "*Edward Stanley (bishop) (1779\u20131849), Bishop of Norwich", "*Edward Stanley (1790\u20131863), Member of Parliament for West Cumberland, 1832\u20131852", "*Edward Stanley (surgeon) (1793\u20131862), author of books on surgery, twice President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England", "*Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley (1802\u20131869), British politician", "*Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby (1826\u20131893), British statesman, twice Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "*Edward Stanley (Bridgwater MP) (1826\u20131907), Member of Parliament for West Somerset and Bridgwater", "*Edward Stanley, 4th Baron Stanley of Alderley (1839\u20131925), English educationalist", "*Edward Stanley (cricketer) (1852\u20131896), English cricketer", "*Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby (1865\u20131948), British soldier, Conservative politician, diplomat and racehorse owner", "*Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (died 1938) (1894\u20131938), British Conservative politician", "*Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley (1907\u20131971), English nobleman", "*Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby (1918\u20131994), British peer", "*Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby (born 1962), British peer", "*Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (born 1998), son of the 19th Earl of Derby"]}, {"page": "Owen Stanley", "response": ["Stanley was born in Alderley, Cheshire, the son of Edward Stanley, rector of Alderley and later Bishop of Norwich.
