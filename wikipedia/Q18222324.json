The process entailed vacuum drying the whole grain, then steaming, and finally vacuum drying and removal of the husk.British Patents 519,926 (10 April 1940) and 522,353 (17 June 1940); U.S. Patents 2,239,608 (22 April 1941), 2,287,737 (20 December 1941), 2,287,737 (23 June 1942), cited in Kik and Williams Besides increasing rice's nutritional value, it also made it resistant to weevils and reduced cooking time.", "In 1932, Forrest Mars Sr., moved to the United Kingdom with a remit to expand the Mars food company internationally. While in the United Kingdom, Mars learned of Erich Huzenlaub's work with rice. Huzenlaub's London-based company was Rice Conversion Ltd.Rice Conversion Ltd. Pamphlet The two eventually formed Mars and HuzenlaubMars and Huzenlaub Documents in Houston, Texas, which gave Forrest Mars partial ownership of the Huzenlaub Process rice conversion patent. In 1942, through Mars's guidance and sponsorship, Huzenlaub created, together with Houston food broker Gordon L. Harwell, the company Converted Rice, Inc., which sold its entire output to the U.S. and British armed forces. The advantage of this product was that it could be air-dropped to troops in the field without risk of weevil infestation, and it could be cooked more quickly than other rice products.  Additionally, the converted rice product would retain more nutritional value. In 1944, with additional financing from the Defense Plant Corporation and an investment by Forrest Mars, it built a second large plant. In 1959, Forrest Mars purchased Erich Huzenlaub's interest in the company and merged it into his Food Manufacturers, Inc."]}, {"page": "List of German inventors and discoverers", "response": ["* Erich Huzenlaub: Huzenlaub Process for parboiling"]}, {"page": "List of people from Stuttgart", "response": ["* Erich Huzenlaub (1888\u20131964), chemist"]}, {"page": "Huzenlaub", "response": ["#REDIRECT:Erich Huzenlaub"]}, {"page": "Erich Gustav Huzenlaub", "response": ["#REDIRECT:Erich Huzenlaub"]}, {"page": "List of German chemists", "response": ["* Erich Huzenlaub"]}]}}
