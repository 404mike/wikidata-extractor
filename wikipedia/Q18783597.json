In response, the BSAJ established a store of field equipment in Jordan. In the early 1970s the Director of the BSAJ, Crystal Bennett, conducted excavations in southern Jordan using this store and her private flat in Amman. However, the need for a larger and more permanent base became apparent when Bennett was asked by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities to direct major excavations of the Amman Citadel. She rented a large house opposite the University of Jordan and established it as the new British Institute at Amman for Archaeology and History (BIAAH) in 1975. Bennett served as both the Director of the BSAJ and the BIAAH until 1978, when she retired from the BSAJ and relocated to Amman full-time. In the same year, the British Academy agreed to register the BIAAH as an official overseas institute.", "* Crystal Bennett (1978\u20131983)"]}, {"page": "Crystal-Margaret Bennett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Crystal Bennett"]}, {"page": "Module talk:Wikidata/Archive 2", "response": ["When you invoke getDateValue to get a date that's only entered into Wikidata as a year, it seems to consistently return a value 1 less than the actual year. For example, try adding  to Crystal Bennett. It returns 1917 instead of 1918. It's currently breaking the functionality of , which an editor is using as an excuse to mass remove it from articles, so if anyone could take a look that'd be great. \u2013\u202fJoe\u00a0(talk) 04:29, 1 January 2017 (UTC)"]}]}}
