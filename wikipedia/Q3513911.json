He didn't need to \u2013 because, given the right conditions, the stories activated, sowing themselves.\" He then explains how his father used these stories to impart wisdom: \"My father always had a tale at hand to divert our attention, or to use as a way of transmitting an idea or a thought. He used to say that the great collections of stories from the East were like encyclopedias, storehouses of wisdom and knowledge ready to be studied, to be appreciated and cherished. To him, stories represented much more than mere entertainment. He saw them as complex psychological documents, forming a body of knowledge that had been collected and refined since the dawn of humanity and, more often than not, passed down by word of mouth.\"", "One of Shah's daughters, Saira Shah, became notable in\u00a02001 for reporting on women's rights in Afghanistan in her documentary Beneath the Veil.

What makes them distinctively teaching stories however is something different: they are likely to be open-ended, depending on the individual members of their audience for a variety of interpretations. Their purpose is ultimately to change the thinking process itself. They put at the disposal of those who know them an instrument for measuring themselves, the world and situations that they encounter.from Learning from Stories, A lecture by Idries Shah before a live audience in 1976 available as audio to download at .
