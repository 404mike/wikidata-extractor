Its melody comes from the final movement of Niccol\u00f2 Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 2 in B minor, where the tune was reinforced metaphorically by a 'little handbell'.

The family moved to Graz in 1868, and his father died later that year. He studied with Wilhelm Mayer (who published his own compositions under the pseudonym of W. A. R\u00e9my and also taught Ferruccio Busoni).  In 1881 he went to Leipzig to study philosophy, but soon devoted himself entirely to music, entering the Conservatory in 1883 and studying in Weimar as one of Franz Liszt's last pupils. Liszt helped produce the world premiere of Weingartner's opera Sakuntala in 1884 with the Weimar orchestra. According to Liszt biographer Alan Walker, however, the Weimar orchestra of the 1880s was far from its peak of a few decades earlier and the performance ended up poorly, with the orchestra going one way and the chorus another. Walker got this account from Weingartner's autobiography, published in Z\u00fcrich and Leipzig in 1928\u20131929. The same year, 1884, he assumed the directorship of the K\u00f6nigsberg Opera. From 1885 to 1887 he was Kapellmeister in Danzig, then in Hamburg until 1889, and in Mannheim until 1891. Starting that year, he was Kapellmeister of the Royal Opera and conductor of symphony concerts in Berlin.  He eventually resigned from the opera post while continuing to conduct the symphony concerts, and then settled in Munich, where he incurred the enmity of pundits like Rudolf Louis and Ludwig Thuille."]}, {"page": "War of the Romantics", "response": ["The validity of program music was also a point of contention. In his 1854 book, Von Musikalisch-Sch\u00f6nen, Hanslick stated that music did not and could not represent anything  specific other than itself. It could suggest realistic impressions in the manner of Hector Berlioz, as well as impressions and feelings, such as those represented by the movement headings in the score of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.Wagner believed that this attitude was closer to Liszt's intentions than any attempts at exact pictorial representation. See Wagner's \"Open Letter on Liszt's Symphonic Poems\", 1857, Neue Zeitschrift fur Musik April 10, 1857, which originated as a letter, Feb 15 1857 to Princess Marie von Sayn-Wittgenstein (see Walker, p 231 note, paperback edition).  Liszt's prefaces to the works also seem to back up this view. This view was not considered novel in itself. \"What was new,\" according to musicologist and Liszt biographer Alan Walker, \"was that [Hanslick] was a musician addressing musicians, and he found a large audience.\" Between the first and second of this book's nine editions, the first six of Liszt's symphonic poems were published and the Faust Symphony premiered under Liszt's baton. Hanslick revised his text to mention Liszt and those works specifically."]}, {"page": "Totentanz (Liszt)", "response": ["Some of the titles of Liszt\u2019s pieces, such as Totentanz, Fun\u00e9railles, La lugubre gondola and Pens\u00e9e des morts, show the composer's fascination with death. In the young Liszt we can already observe manifestations of his obsession with death, with religion, and with heaven and hell. According to Alan Walker, Liszt frequented Parisian \"hospitals, gambling casinos and asylums\" in the early 1830s, and he even went down into prison dungeons in order to see those condemned to die."]}, {"page": "Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)", "response": ["The first performance of the original version took place on October 25, 1875, in Boston, conducted by Benjamin Johnson Lang and with B\u00fclow as soloist.

Although the premiere was a success with the audience, the critics were not so impressed. One wrote that the concerto was \"hardly destined ..to become classical\".Naxos George Whitefield Chadwick, who was in the audience, recalled in a memoir years later: \"They had not rehearsed much and the trombones got in wrong in the 'tutti' in the middle of the first movement, whereupon B\u00fclow sang out in a perfectly audible voice, The brass may go to hell\".Steven Ledbetter, notes for Colorado Symphony Orchestra  However, the work fared much better at its performance in New York City on November 22, under Leopold Damrosch.Alan Walker (2009), p. 219"]}, {"page": "Mephisto Waltzes", "response": ["Composed in 1883, the Third Mephisto Waltz, S.216, takes the harmonic language even further, featuring chords built up by fourths with numerous passages of descending minor triads whose roots are a semitone apart.

It is best regarded as a 'fourths' chord in its last inversion.\"Walker, The Final Years, 450\u2013451. Tonally, the music is pulled between F major, D minor and D minor.

This melodic device was also used as the backbone for the main theme of the preceding Scherzo movement and part of the coda of the opening movement. The melody following the repeated B, is, as Alan Walker notes, \"a strict retrogade\" of the first movement's main theme.

This was a consequence of the Industrial Revolution, according to music critic and historian Harold C. Schonberg, which brought changes to the early 19th-century lifestyles of the working masses. The lower and middle classes began to take an interest in the arts, which previously had been enjoyed mostly by the clergy and aristocracy.Schonberg, Conductors, 68. In the 1830s, concert halls were few, and orchestras served mainly in the production of operas\u2014symphonic works were considered far lower in importance.Schonberg, Conductiors, 68. However, the European music scene underwent a transformation in the 1840s. As the role of religion diminished, Salmi asserts, 19th-century culture remained a religious one and the attendance of the arts in historical or similarly impressive surroundings \"may still have generated a rapture akin to experiencing the sacred.\"Salmi, 54. Schonberg, cultural historian Peter Cay and musicologist Alan Walker add that, while aristocrats still held private musical events, public concerts grew as institutions for the middle class, which was growing prosperous and could now afford to attend.Cay, 229; Schonberg, Conductors, 69; Walker, Weimar, 306. As interest burgeoned, these concerts were performed at a rapidly increasing number of venues.Bonds, New Grove (2001), 24:834; Cay, 229. Programs often ran over three hours, \"even if the content was thin: two or more symphonies, two overtures, vocal and instrumental numbers, duets, a concerto.\" Roughly half of the presented music was vocal in nature.Schonberg, Conductors, 70. Symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn or Ludwig van Beethoven usually opened or concluded concerts, and \"while these works were revered as models of great music, they were ultimately less popular than the arias and scenes from operas and oratorios that stood prominently in the middle of these concerts.\"Weber, New Grove (2001), 6:227.", "Franz Liszt, a Hungarian composer, had attempted to write a Revolutionary Symphony as early as 1830; however, his focus for the early part of his adult life was mostly on his performing career. By 1847, Liszt was famous throughout Europe as a virtuoso pianist.Walker, Weimar, 6. \"Lisztomania\" swept across Europe, the emotional charge of his recitals making them \"more like s\u00e9ances than serious musical events\", and the reaction of many of his listeners could be characterized as hysterical.Walker, Virtuoso, 289. Musicologist Alan Walker says, \"Liszt was a natural phenomenon, and people were swayed by him.... With his mesmeric personality and long mane of flowing hair, he created a striking stage presence. And there were many witnesses to testify that his playing did indeed raise the mood of an audience to a level of mystical ecstasy.\" The demands of concert life \"reached exponential proportions\" and \"every public appearance led to demands for a dozen others.\" Liszt desired to compose music, such as large-scale orchestral works, but lacked the time to do so as a travelling virtuoso. In September 1847, Liszt gave his last public recital as a paid artist and announced his retirement from the concert platform.Walker, Virtuoso, 442. He settled in Weimar, where he had been made its honorary music director in 1842, to work on his compositions.", "Liszt desired to expand single-movement works beyond the concert overture form. As he himself said, \"New wine demands new bottles,\"As quoted in Walker, New Grove (2000), 14:772 and Weimar, 309. and as Alan Walker points out, the \"language of music was changing; it seemed pointless to Liszt to contain it in forms that were almost 100 years old.\"Walker, New Grove (2000), 14:772. The music of overtures is to inspire listeners to imagine scenes, images, or moods; Liszt intended to combine those programmatic qualities with a scale and musical complexity normally reserved for the opening movement of Classical symphonies.Spencer, P., 1233. The opening movement, with its interplay of contrasting themes under sonata form, was normally considered the most important part of the symphony.Larue and Wolf, New Grove (2001), 24:814\u2013815. To achieve his objectives, he needed a more flexible method of developing musical themes than sonata form would allow, but one that would preserve the overall unity of a musical composition.Searle, New Grove (1980), 11:41.Searle, Works, 61.", "Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems.Shulstad, 214. His doing so, Alan Walker states, \"was a reflection of the historical position in which he found himself.\"Walker, Weimar, 306. Liszt was aware these musical works would be experienced not just by select connoisseurs, as might have been the case in previous generations, but also by the general public. In addition, he knew about the public's fondness for attaching stories to instrumental music, regardless of their source, their relevance to a musical composition or whether the composer had actually sanctioned them. Therefore, in a pre-emptive gesture, Liszt provided context before others could invent one to take its place. Liszt may have also felt that since many of these works were written in new forms, some sort of verbal or written explanation would be welcome to explain their shape.Searle, \"Orchestral Works\", 283.", "In developing the symphonic poem, Liszt \"satisfied three of the principal aspirations of 19th century music: to relate music to the world outside, to integrate multi-movement forms ... and to elevate instrumental programme music to a level higher than that of opera, the genre previously regarded as the highest mode of musical expression.\" In fulfilling these needs, the symphonic poems played a major role, widening the scope and expressive power of the advanced music of its time. According to music historian Alan Walker, \"Their historical importance is undeniable; both Sibelius and Richard Strauss were influenced by them, and adapted and developed the genre in their own way. For all their faults, these pieces offer many examples of the pioneering spirit for which Liszt is celebrated.\"", "* Searle, Humphrey, ed.

Works of Berlioz, Schumann and Wagner were also featured, but Liszt's compositions predominated.Brown and Stratton, 21. While the performances of the Faust and Dante symphonies were British premieres, the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace; nevertheless, Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences. Les pr\u00e9ludes was performed three times at the Bache concerts, Mazeppa, Festkl\u00e4nge and Orpheus each twice and Tasso once. Part of this strategy of familiarity was the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a way to prepare audiences for the orchestral versions. Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865, when he and Dannreuther presented the two-piano arrangement of Les pr\u00e9ludes. Another part of this strategy was supplying learned, well-considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes. Sometimes Bache wrote them himself; at other times, he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl Weitman and Frederick Niecks. According to musicologist Alan Walker, they \"are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time, and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples\u2014a sure sign that they were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over.\"Walker (2005), 115. According to Walker, they still are worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas, while transmitted through members of Liszt's inner circle, probably originated with the composer himself. These notes, along with the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls \"a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt's new status as a composer\"."]}]}}
