The same performers gave the work's second performance three weeks later in Queen's Hall, London.

Bridges' poem is a requiem of sorts for all past artists. The finished work is scored for the unusual forces of organ, brass, percussion and strings with chorus and solo soprano. The Choral Fantasia was first performed in 1931 at the Three Choirs festival in Gloucester Cathedral with Dorothy Silk (Holst's favorite soprano, who had premiered his Choral Symphony six years earlier) singing the solo part, and Holst conducting. The work was first performed in the United States on May 19, 1932, at Ann Arbor, Michigan's annual May Festival at Hill Auditorium; the composer conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the University of Michigan's University Choral Union, and soprano Helen Van Loon."]}, {"page": "Oxford Harmonic Choir", "response": ["*Soprano \u2013 Isobel Baillie, Susan Bullock, Lynne Dawson, Heather Harper, Margaret Ritchie, Dorothy Silk."]}, {"page": "English Singers", "response": ["In October 1932 Kelly formed a new group, the New English Singers,Britten, p. 306. whose repertoire was again Elizabethan madrigals but also including contemporary works by Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams.

It was Culwick who attracted artists like Dorothy Silk and John Goss to Dublin while also encouraging local talent. Among the notable performances was the first performance in Dublin of Granville Bantock's Vanity of Vanities and Ralph Vaughan Williams's Mass in G minor. In 1927, the choir won a prize at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Holyhead. Following this the choir was renamed in honour of her father and her success, the Culwick Choral Society."]}]}}
