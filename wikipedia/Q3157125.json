He was first educated at Emanuel School in London, before being given a boarder's education at the now defunct Scottish school on the banks of Loch Rannoch, Rannoch School. His rugby skills were honed by the school's science teacher. Smith stated: \"The things I learnt while playing rugby at Rannoch were work ethic and fitness. Our pitch was covered in snow and frozen solid for three months of the year, so there was a lot of running up and down hills. We were pretty well drilled and were made to work hard. There were times when it was pretty tough and cold out here but at the end of the day rugby is a hard game and you need to be tough to play it\"."]}, {"page": "Dumbarton F.C.", "response": ["* Jack Bell"]}, {"page": "John Bell", "response": ["*Jack Bell (footballer, born 1891), English footballer", "*Jack Bell (1869\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*Jack Bell (footballer, born 1904) (1904\u20131950), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1898\u201399 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Robert Smyth McColl (3), John Campbell (2), Robert Hamilton (2), Jack Bell, Alexander Christie"]}, {"page": "1899\u20131900 in Scottish football", "response": ["|David Wilson (2), Jack Bell, Alexander Smith, Robert Hamilton", "|Robert Smyth McColl (3), Jack Bell"]}]}}
