At that time \u201cVoice and Diction\u201d focused entirely on the mouth and nasal cavity to produce speech sounds.  Fogerty\u2019s technique ended up focusing on the entire body and voice to produce speech.  At first, she used just the lungs to resonate the sound, but soon included the whole body, because she discovered that posture and movement also affected speech. It ultimately became known as the \u201cBody and Voice\u201d technique.[1]  She was founder and principal of the Central School of Speech and Drama in London from 1906 to 1942.[2]", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Laurence Olivier", "response": ["In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, told his son that he must gain not only admission to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but also a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses.
