He scored 162 runs at 10.12 with a best of 17 not out.\nHe played his early cricket with Castleford C.C. and represented Yorkshire 2nd XI from 1954 to 1957. He went on to be a professional at Idle C.C. in 1957 and 1958, taking 56 wickets at 11.87 in the latter year, and was with Leeds C.C. in 1959. He represented Cumberland in Minor Counties cricket from 1963 to 1969.In 1980 he was the landlord of a public house in Newmillerdam, Wakefield.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Broughton (name)", "response": ["* Peter Broughton (born 1935), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Ray Julian", "response": ["From 1959 to 1965, Julian was Leicestershire's main wicketkeeper, though his indifferent batting and Leicestershire's perennially long tail in this period meant that other wicketkeepers such as John Mitten and Geoffrey Burch were tried, though not usually for long. His best season as a wicketkeeper was 1961, when he received his county cap and took 72 catches with 7 stumpings. As a batsman, he scored 561 runs in 1960 with an average of 12.46 and a highest score of just 44: the high aggregate reflects the fact that he went in at No 8 because in Terry Spencer, John Savage and Brian Boshier or Peter Broughton, there were usually three even worse batsmen than he was, and Leicestershire usually batted twice in each match. His highest score, one of only two innings over 50, was 51, made against Worcestershire in 1962 as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw."]}, {"page": "Broughton, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Broughton"]}]}}
