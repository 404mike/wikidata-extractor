He derived \"XTC\" from Jimmy Durante's exclamation upon discovering the lost chord: \"That's it! I'm in ecstasy!\". The name was chosen mainly for its emphatic appearance in print. Meanwhile, owing to creative differences with Partridge, synthesizer player Jonathan Perkins quit the band. In search of his replacement, Partridge found Barry Andrews through a \"keyboard player seeks band\" advertisement. Instead of a formal audition, the two went out drinking together. Andrews was immediately hired. During the first band rehearsal, Partridge recalled, \"He sounded like Jon Lord from Deep Purple; fuzz box, wah wah pedal, bluesy runs. I said, You don't have to play like that, you can play like us if you want. The next rehearsal, he was like a maniac, like if Mir\u00f3 had played electric organ. Fantastic.\" December 1976 officially marked the beginning of the Partridge\u2013Moulding\u2013Chambers\u2013Andrews line-up. The members cut their long hair and, for a time, wore \"kung-fu mechanic\" outfits on stage.", "To support the album, XTC embarked on an acoustic-guitar American radio tour that lasted for two weeks in May. The shows were carried out without financial compensation for the band. Gregory commented that it was an \"interesting\" style of promotion, but \"incredibly hard work\", as the band performed at about four radio stations a day for three weeks: \"We also did a live acoustic set for MTV in front of an audience which worried Andy a bit but he got through it.\" This inspired the network to invite more artists to perform stripped-down sets, calling the series \"unplugged\". XTC's performance of \"King for a Day\" on Late Night with David Letterman marked the first time the group played in front of a live audience in seven years. A similar acoustic tour was planned for Europe, but cancelled when Partridge discovered that the Paris date would be broadcast from a sold-out 5,000 seater venue. After an unsuccessful attempt was made to coax Partridge back into regular touring, they took a short break. Partridge produced And Love for All (1990), the third album by the Lilac Time, and compered for an unbroadcast children's game show named Matchmakers. Gregory played for Johnny Hates Jazz, Marc Almond and Francesco Messina whilst producing for Cud. Moulding performed a special event concert with David Marx and the Refugees, a Swindon-based band that reunited him with Barry Andrews.", "In 2006, Partridge recorded an album, Monstrance, with Barry Andrews and drummer Martyn Barker. During one of the sessions, some of his hearing was destroyed following a studio mishap, which caused him to develop severe and permanent tinnitus. Near the end of the year, he told an interviewer that Moulding recently (\"a couple of months back\") lost interest in writing, performing or even listening to music. He remained hopeful that the situation was temporary and assured that they had \"not killed off the XTC head. I mean, we still have the head cryogenically frozen. ... It's no good making a record and calling it XTC, certainly, if Colin isn't involved.\" In November, he stated that he had been forced to regard the group \"in the past tense,\" with no likelihood of a new project unless Moulding should have a change of heart. Months later, Partridge intimated that Moulding had moved and changed his phone number, effectively ending all contact between the two and reducing their correspondence to emails exchanged via their manager to discuss the division of the band's assets. Partridge also said he and Gregory\u2014their differences now resolved\u2014had considered working together again.", "Barry Andrews, XTC's keyboard player for their first two albums, emerged as a third solo songwriter on the group's second album Go 2. However, he left the band shortly thereafter. His replacement, guitarist Dave Gregory, did not contribute songs, but was the only one in the band who could score music, and frequently contributed orchestral arrangements. Moulding said that when Andrews was in the band, Partridge had \"no kind of foil\" to work with, as both musicians were drawn to dissonant harmonies: \"[Andy] used to like the real kind of angular, spiky, upward-thrusting guitar ... if one is angular, the other has to kind of straighten him out ... So when Dave came in, and was a much straighter player, it seemed to make more sense, I think.\" Starting in 1982, Gregory extended his talents to keyboards as well, since Partridge and Moulding were not adept with the instrument.", "* Barry Andrews \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals (1976\u20131978)", "  bar:Barry      text:Barry Andrews"]}, {"page": "Shriekback", "response": ["Shriekback are an English rock band formed in 1981 in Kentish Town by Barry Andrews, formerly of XTC and The League of Gentlemen (keyboards/synthesizers/vocals), and Dave Allen, formerly of Gang of Four (bass), with Carl Marsh, formerly of Out on Blue Six (guitars/vocals) soon added to the line-up.
