After several line-up changes and an album recorded for a minor Breton label, the band was signed to Topic records and released its official self-titled debut in 1977 with the line-up of McNeill (fiddle, vocals), Reid (keyboards, vocals), Jamie McMenemy (bouzouki, vocals), and John Gahagan (whistle). Gahagan left before the recording of the follow-up, At the Front (1978), and was replaced by Irish singer-guitarist Pat Kilbride. The departure of both Kilbride and McMenemy shortly afterward brought in Jen Clark (vocals, cittern, dulcimer) and Duncan MacGillivray (Highland pipes) for Stand Easy (1979), thus beginning Battlefield Band's tradition of using bagpipes on their albums. Clark was replaced by Northumbrian singer-guitarist Ged Foley on Home is Where the Van Is (1980), which marked a switch from Topic records to producer Robin Morton's label Temple. Home is Where the Van Is also inaugurated the band's practice of placing original songs alongside traditional material. The line-up changes continued, though the group remained based around the core of McNeill and Reid until 1990, when McNeill left to pursue a solo career. Reid finally left the band at the end of 2010, concentrating on his musical duo with guitarist & singer Rob van Sante, the Battlefield Band's sound engineer."]}, {"page": "Tartan Noir", "response": ["* Alex Gray"]}, {"page": "St Columba's School, Kilmacolm", "response": ["*Sandra McGruther, author of the Detective Lorimer novels, writing as Alex Gray was an English teacher here"]}, {"page": "Lin Anderson", "response": ["Lin is a member of the Femmes Fatales crime writing trio, together with Alanna Knight and Alex Gray.", "She and Alex Gray are amongst the co-founders of Bloody Scotland, a Tartan Noir and Scottish crime writer's festival, which is held in Stirling since 2012."]}, {"page": "Alexander Gray", "response": ["Alexander or Alex Gray may refer to:", "*Alex Gray (ice hockey) (1898\u20131986), Canadian ice hockey player", "*Alex Gray (sportsman, born 1991), rugby union and American football player", "*Alex Gray (safety), American football safety for Edmonton Eskimos", "*Alex Gray (author) (born 1950), Scottish author"]}, {"page": "1950", "response": ["* May 27 \u2013 Alex Gray, Scottish crime writer "]}, {"page": "1950 in Scotland", "response": ["* 27 May \u2013 Alex Gray, crime novelist"]}, {"page": "The Cuckoo's Calling", "response": ["The first printing of the first UK edition ran to at least 1,500 copies, with a cover that features a quote from Val McDermid, while the back cover has quotes from Mark Billingham and Alex Gray.
