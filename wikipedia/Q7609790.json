Their two 4\u00d76in inside cylinders had Bagnall-Price valve gear and a geared drive to the rear axle, but coupling rods between the axles. The arrangement of the water tanks was particularly unusual, being a front tank ahead of the smokebox, in order to reduce width. The boilers were launch-type, as were commonly used for small locomotives with insufficient space between the frames for a conventional firebox.", "| align=\"center\"|1877Stephen Lewin", "| align=\"center\"|1877Stephen Lewin"]}, {"page": "Torrington and Marland Railway", "response": ["|Stephen Lewin"]}, {"page": "Lewin", "response": ["* Stephen Lewin (19th century), English builder of steamboats and steam locomotives"]}, {"page": "List of torpedo boat classes of the Royal Navy", "response": ["*Stephen Lewin, Poole"]}, {"page": "Lewin, Stephen", "response": ["#redirectStephen Lewin"]}, {"page": "Cornish Hush Mine", "response": ["thumb|Stephen Lewin's narrow gauge mining locomotive, 1875", "The mine was connected by a  long  gauge light railway to Whitfield Brow.Paul Jarman: On the trail of Samson\u2026 3 July 2012.

The gears on the left wheels of the locomotive came neither in touch with the rail nor with a rack. The rear axle was driven crankshaft above of the boiler, which had a pinion on the left hand side underneath a protective cover with and a flywheel on the right hand side. The front axle, which was coupled to the rear axle by a connecting rod, did not actually need a gear, but had one, so that the front and rear axles could be exchanged or replaced with the same spare part when the gear was worn."]}, {"page": "Beamish Museum transport collection", "response": ["|Stephen Lewin"]}]}}
