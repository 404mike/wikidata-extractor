He guided the club from their old stadium into the 32,000-seater St Mary's Stadium, which opened in 2001, and the club continued to follow a long-standing policy of selling players to clubs for high prices. Dean Richards, who was sold to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a38\u00a0million, and Kevin Davies, who was sold to Blackburn Rovers for \u00a37\u00a0million, are good examples. Davies was subsequently bought back by Southampton for a much smaller fee. James Beattie joined the club for \u00a31\u00a0million from Blackburn Rovers, enjoyed great form at Southampton, and later joined Everton for \u00a36\u00a0million."]}]}}
