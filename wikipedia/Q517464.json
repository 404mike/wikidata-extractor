Later that year, the term was also used by Joy Division's manager, Tony Wilson on 15 September in an interview for the BBC TV programme's Something Else. Wilson described Joy Division as \"gothic\" compared to the pop mainstream, right before a live performance of the band. The term was later applied to \"newer bands such as Bauhaus who had arrived in the wake of Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees\".

With her art background, she landed a job in an architectural firm but left after eight months. It was then that she met rock journalist Nick Kent and landed a position at the music magazine the NME, writing what she subsequently described as \"half-baked philosophical drivel and nonsensical tirades.\" This proved not to last and Hynde later got a job at Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood's little-known clothing store, SEX. At one point she tried to convince Johnny Rotten and then Sid Vicious (of the Sex Pistols, who were managed by McLaren) to marry her to get her a work permit. Hynde's version of this episode has it that Rotten \"offered to go to a registry office with me and do the unmentionable\" but when he subsequently pulled out, Vicious volunteered to take his place. Upon arrival at the registry office the following morning, they found it \"closed for an extended holiday\" and were unable to attend the following day due to Vicious making a court appearance. Hynde then attempted to start a band in France before her return to Cleveland in 1975."]}, {"page": "Mick Taylor", "response": ["Not long after those recording sessions, Taylor went on a six-week expedition to Brazil, to travel down the Amazon River in a boat and explore Latin music. Just before the release of the album in October 1974, Taylor told Nick Kent from the NME about the new LP and that he had co-written \"Till the Next Goodbye\" and \"Time Waits for No One\" with Jagger. Kent told Taylor he had seen the finished artwork for the sleeve, which revealed the absence of any songwriting credits for Taylor."]}, {"page": "Smiley Smile", "response": ["In the description of journalist Nick Kent, Smiley Smile \"appeared like the single most underwhelming musical statement of the sixties\". It was a \"major disappointment\" for fans, many of whom had expected a work similar to Pet Sounds and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper.  According to writer Scott Schinder, the LP was released to \"general incomprehension. While Smile may have divided the Beach Boys' fans had it been released, Smiley Smile merely baffled them.\"  Anderle said that whatever new fans the group had brought with Pet Sounds were \"immediately lost with the release of 'Heroes of Villains,' then with the album [Smiley Smile].\"  Biographer Keith Badman writes that the music press responded by \"effectively blacklisting the band, refusing to review their latest records, or reviewing them long after they have been released.\" "]}, {"page": "London SS", "response": ["Brian James and Rat Scabies joined Johnny Moped guitarist Ray Burns and backed up music journalist Nick Kent in the shortlived  Subterraneans.

Wilson ultimately declared to his bandmates that he would be withdrawing from future tours for an indefinite period of time. He said, \"I told them I foresee a beautiful future for the Beach Boys group, but the only way we could achieve it was if they did their job and I did mine.\" According to Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Wilson had been considering retiring from the music industry, but changed his mind upon hearing their recent song \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" (produced and co-written by Phil Spector). Wilson later told a journalist that his decision to quit touring was a byproduct of his \"fucked up\" jealousy over Spector and the Beatles.

Carl told Kent that the new songs demonstrated Brian's new \"funky\" approach.  In September, the band recorded a version of the Del-Vikings' \"Come Go with Me\", but the track was ultimately left off 15 Big Ones. In October, Wilson recorded a rendition of Van Dyke Parks' \"Come to the Sunshine\", also intended for the band's forthcoming album, but a dispute prevented the track's inclusion.", "In his book Icons of Rock, Scott Schinder called 15 Big Ones \"largely a letdown,  largely of lackluster remakes of rock and roll oldies, along with a handful of lightweight but charming new songs by Brian. Rock critic Nick Kent called it \"utterly uninspired and weary-sounding ... clearly intended only as therapy for Wilson's long dormant production talents.\" Musician Dennis Diken, who wrote the liner notes to the album's 2000 reissue, acknowledged such criticisms and opined, \"If you can accept all these points and put it behind you that this isn't Smile, Pet Sounds or even Wild Honey, give 15 Big Ones a spin and dig on what is a very cool and fun Beach Boys album.\""]}, {"page": "The Beach Boys Love You", "response": ["Favorable reviews were penned by numerous esteemed critics, including Circus Lester Bangs, Creems Mitchell Cohen, NMEs Nick Kent, The Village Voices Robert Christgau, and Rolling Stones Billy Altman.

Brian Wilson still isn't singing as well as he used to, but his playing and composing talents have certainly returned from wherever they've been the past few years.\" Patti Smith, known as the \"godmother of punk\", contributed a review in Hit Parader that was written in the form of a poem.

Besides its well received albums, the band is also noted for its strong live performances. The rest of the band has included many of New York's strongest players: all the members of Jeff Buckley's band, members of Medeski Martin and Wood, Ed Pastorini, Ben Perowsky, James Genus, Thomas Bartlett, Jamie Saft and members of Ollabelle have all played in Elysian Fields at various times."]}, {"page": "Bedford College, London", "response": ["*Nick Kent (born 1951), English rock critic"]}, {"page": "Heroes and Villains", "response": ["One of Wilson's \"Heroes and Villains\" recording experiments was, according to journalist Nick Kent, directly inspired by his emerging struggles with auditory hallucinations. Kent wrote that, during a session, Wilson attempted to recreate a \"ghoulish\" voice in his head by \"taking a tape of some acappella Beach Boys vocal horse-play and slowing it down until it was just this vast swamp-like groan of terror. It was the scariest sound of anything he created for Smile ...\" In the September/October 1967 issue of Crawdaddy!, journalist Paul Williams wrote that the song \"originally had a chorus of dogs barking, cropped when Brian heard Sergeant Pepper, and was in many ways - the bicycle rider - a far different song.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Gabriel (1977 album)", "response": ["Rolling Stone critic Stephen Demorest described Peter Gabriel as \"a grab bag collection of songs that bear little resemblance to one another\" and called it \"an impressively rich debut album\".

Nick Kent, writing in NME in 1978, said that Peter Gabriel was \"a fine record with at least one 24-carat irresistible classic in 'Solsbury Hill' and a strong supporting cast of material that, all in all, in a year besmeared with great albums was, in retrospect, sorely underrated.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Gabriel (1978 album)", "response": ["In the NME in 1978, Nick Kent wrote: \"Its brazenly left-field veneer left me cold at first, and it's only now that its strengths are starting to come across\u00a0... once past the disarming non-focus veneer, there's a quietly remarkable talent at work \u2013 quiet in the manner of the slow fuse burn of 'Mother of Violence' with Roy Bittan's piano work outstripping anything he's turned out for either Bruce Springsteen or David Bowie. Closer to the root of the album, there's a purity, a strength to the songs individual enough to mark Gabriel out as a man whose creative zenith is close at hand.\""]}]}}
