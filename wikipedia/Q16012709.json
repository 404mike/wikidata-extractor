He played as a goalkeeper in the Football League for Leeds City, South Shields, Bradford Park Avenue and Stockport County. As a Nottinghamshire County cricketer, he was predominantly a batsman, scoring over a thousand first-class runs in a season on ten occasions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walker (surname)", "response": ["*Willis Walker (1892\u20131991), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Leeds City F.C.", "response": ["| Willis Walker|| South Shields|| \u00a3800"]}, {"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Willis Walker 405 (1913-37)"]}, {"page": "Fred Barratt", "response": ["This fallow period in the mid 1920s made his emergence as a genuine all-rounder in the 1928 season, his benefit year, all the more surprising. In all matches, he took 114 wickets at a cost of 25.18 runs each and, unexpectedly, made 1167 runs at an average of 29.17, not far short of double the average and more than double the aggregate he had achieved in any other season before. Wisden had an explanation for his sudden advance: it attributed it to \"waiting more patiently than heretofore for the right ball to hit\". It added that he \"gave some remarkable displays of high speed scoring which never degenerated into mere slogging\". The 1928 season saw the only two centuries of Barratt's career. The first, an unbeaten 139 which remained his highest score, came in a high-scoring match on an easy pitch with short boundaries at Coventry, and set some records. Nottinghamshire's total of 656 for three declared was the highest at the time for the loss of only three wickets, and four of the five batsmen used \u2013 George Gunn, Whysall, Willis Walker and Barratt \u2013 made hundreds. Barratt, unusually promoted to No 5, and Walker put on 196 in 84 minutes and Barratt's 139 included seven sixes and 18 fours in what Wisden termed \"a remarkable display of powerful driving\". The vast total was not a match-winner: Warwickshire batted across the rest of the second day after Nottinghamshire's declaration, and then rain prevented any play on the third and final day, so that there was no decision even on first innings."]}, {"page": "Walter Keeton", "response": ["Keeton made his debut for Nottinghamshire's second eleven in 1925 and the following year made his first-team debut, playing in two County Championship matches as a lower middle-order batsman. The Nottinghamshire side of the late 1920s was a settled and successful unit under the captaincy of Arthur Carr, with apparently ageless batsmen such as George Gunn, Wilfred Payton and the slightly younger William Whysall, Willis Walker and Carr himself dominating the batting line-up. Keeton and other young batsmen such as Charles Harris and George Gunn junior were given few first-team opportunities, and Keeton played in just five games in 1928 and two in the Championship-winning season of 1929 \u2013 one of those two was against Oxford University \u2013 and none at all in both 1927 and 1930."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Nottinghamshire (Notts) had the formidable pace attack of Harold Larwood and Bill Voce for several seasons. Until they fell away somewhat in the late thirties, Notts were one of the most competitive teams and usually in contention. They won the title in 1929 and were runners-up in three other seasons. Noted batsmen were George Gunn, \"Dodge\" Whysall, Arthur Carr, Joe Hardstaff Jr, Charles Harris, Walter Keeton, Wilfred Payton and Willis Walker. Besides Larwood and Voce, Notts had good bowlers in Fred Barratt, Tom Richmond and Sam Staples. Ben Lilley succeeded Thomas Oates as wicket-keeper in 1924 and held the post until he retired in 1937 and was succeeded by Arthur Wheat."]}]}}
