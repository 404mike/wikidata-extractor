He made his senior international d\u00e9but in 1996, playing both games for England in their 1996 European Championship victory. Also that year he helped St. Helens win the Championship (Super League I) and Challenge Cup for the first time in two decades. He went on to win a second consecutive Challenge Cup with the club in 1997, but was sold to Hull Sharks at the end of the season.\nAfter spending two years at Hull, Prescott joined Wakefield Trinity (Heritage \u2116 1154) in 2000, but rejoined Hull a year later after being released by Wakefield Trinity due to the club's financial difficulties. He changed his international allegiance to Ireland, who he represented at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. He also made one appearance for Lancashire in 2003, but suffered a serious knee injury while playing for the team, which ultimately ended his playing career.\nIn 2006, Prescott was diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer and was given months to live. He set up the Steve Prescott Foundation in 2007, and went on to organise a series of money-raising initiatives. He raised almost half a million pounds for charity through the foundation, and was awarded an MBE in 2009 for his efforts. After a long battle with the disease, he died aged 39. In October 2013 a small group of people started a campaign to get the highest honour in British Rugby League the Man of Steel Award to be renamed after Steve. On 5 March 2014 the RFL announced that the Man of Steel award will be renamed after Steve and is now known as the Steve Prescott Man of Steel Award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 26", "response": ["*  1973   \u2013 Steve Prescott, English rugby player (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "November 9", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Steve Prescott, English rugby player (b. 1973)"]}, {"page": "2000 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["Ireland1.

Although initially, players were signed either from other clubs, or would go straight into first team reckoning after being signed from their amateur club at a much later age than today's system; as the game became more widespread in the town, across the North\u2014West and nationally, a system had to be introduced in order to suffice the amount of youth talent that the club homed. More early examples of players that made the grade following on form their stints in the academy and reserves (previously known as the \"St Helens Colts\") include Steve Prescott, Paul Forber, Gary Connolly, and Chris Arkwright. St Helens' traditional policy with youth was to make them better players for the club. Now, however, it can be argued that Saints look to make them internationals, with no less than five of the current St Helens squad's youth products having gone on to represent either Great Britain or England or both. St Helens youth policy does not operate solely in the borough boundaries of the town. Indeed, many of St Helens current and past squads call areas like Widnes, Wigan, Cumbria and Oldham home. St Helens have, also, branched even into rugby union territory and other wider national areas for youth players; most recently, Daniel Brotherton, a winger from Northampton, signed a professional contract with the club, and has made great strides in the under 18s after his signing from Northampton Demons."]}, {"page": "John Parr", "response": ["2015 saw Parr on the road doing international and UK shows with Bonnie Tyler, Kenney Jones and Cockney Rebel.
