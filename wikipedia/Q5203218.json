He credits this to Henry Chalfant's coverage of subway graffiti in New York City  in Spraycan and Subway Art, later as a teenager skateboarding and in particular Thrasher magazine's coverage of skateboard deck graphics led his interest in stickers and the DIY mentality associated with skate and punk fanzines.\nHe attended an illustration and design course and worked as a freelance illustrator/designer whilst honing his street work. Influences included Shepard Fairey's \"Obey Giant\" art campaign, Jim Philips, hip hop, punk music, and popular animated cartoons.He held his first major London solo exhibition, Death & Glory, at the Stolenspace gallery, which sold out in October 2006. Since then, his exhibitions have included a solo show, Eyecons, at O Contemporary in Brighton in March 2007, again a sell out show. This featured new paintings, an installation and two prints \u2014 of Kurt \"Kant Complain\" and Cli-Che.D*Face was the owner and curator for the Outside Institute, London's first contemporary art gallery to focus on street art. In 2005 the Outside Institute moved and re-branded to become the Stolen Space Gallery. In 2010, he collaborated with Christina Aguilera, on her album cover of Bionic. In October 2013 D*Face took part in Art Wars at the Saatchi Gallery curated by Ben Moore. The artist was issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which he transformed into a work of art.  Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund set up by Ben Moore to find his brother Tom who has been missing for over ten years. The work was also shown on the Regents Park platform as part of Art Below Regents Park.\nHe participated in the 2015 edition of All City Canvas Global Series, with a mural on the fa\u00e7ade of the Hotel Lisboa in the Colonia Roma. This project was part of the artistic activities of the Dual Year Mexico - United Kingdom.\nD*Face's most recent project was doing the cover art for the Blink-182 album California, which was released on 1 July 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brick Lane", "response": ["Brick Lane has a regular display of graffiti, which features artists such as Banksy, Stik, ROA, D*Face, Ben Eine and Omar Hassan.

Art on canvas is not guerrilla art. Although many guerrilla artists regularly produce \u2018trapped art\u2019, they do not generally consider it to be the same thing. This has manifested itself in a wave of new canvas styles that have a guerrilla art style, but are more comprehensive and finished. Few traditional artists would create artwork intentionally meaning for it to be mass produced with little fidelity and put up with wheat paste. Many guerrilla artists hijack major branding for their own publicity and identity, often at odds with the brand itself. This can be seen with D*Face's hijacking of the Walt Disney signature."]}, {"page": "Jeff Soto", "response": ["In 1999 Soto took a break from all aerosol painting, citing health reasons, boredom with the limitations of the spray can and conflict among graffiti writers.

Since then, Soto has reconnected with his graffiti roots and painted murals in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Miami, London and Paris.
