Following a string of impressive performances in Division Three North, he was signed by Chelsea manager Ted Drake for \u00a37,500 a year later while still doing national service.He made his Chelsea debut in a 3\u20132 victory over Tottenham Hotspur, at White Hart Lane in February 1953, scoring the decisive third goal. His early years at the club saw little success for the team, but in 1954\u201355 Chelsea became First Division champions, with Blunstone an important part of the side, though he continued to juggle appearances for Chelsea with his national service.\nBetween 1954 and 1956, Blunstone was capped on five occasions by England under-23's, scoring three goals, and also won five caps for the senior England team. He made his debut against Wales, creating two goals for teammate Roy Bentley in a 3\u20132 win. He also played in England's famous 7\u20132 win over Scotland at Wembley. He also won two caps for the Football League XI.He retired from football in 1964 aged only 30, having made 347 appearances for Chelsea and scored 54 goals, and immediately joined the Chelsea coaching staff. He was later appointed Brentford manager in 1969 and led the team to the 5th round of the FA Cup in 1971 and promotion to the Third Division a year later. In 1973, after a disagreement with the Brentford chairman, he joined Manchester United which reunited him with his old boss at Chelsea, Tommy Docherty. Blunstone officially became assistant manager at United in 1976 after the departure of Paddy Crerand, but he had been that in all but name since his arrival at Manchester United. Blunstone was also heavily involved in the reserve team at United, working alongside reserve team managers, Bill Foulkes from 1973 to 1974, and then alongside Foulkes' successor, Jack Crompton, from 1974 to 1977. Blunstone later had brief spells as assistant manager of Derby County and manager of Greek clubs Ethnikos and Aris.As of 2005, he was living in Weston, near Crewe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crewe Alexandra F.C.", "response": ["All-time records were set against First Division Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup fourth round in 1960. A new record Gresty Road attendance of 20,000 saw Crewe hold Spurs to a 2\u20132 draw on 30 January.Crisp, pp.9, 91. On 3 February, Tottenham convincingly won the replay 13\u20132, Crewe's record defeat.Crisp, pp.9, 12, 91. The following year, however, Jimmy McGuigan's Crewe side defeated another First Division club, Chelsea, 2\u20131 in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge on 7 January 1961. Chelsea's side included former Crewe player Frank Blunstone\u2014who scored Chelsea's goal\u2014as well as England internationals Peter Bonetti, Jimmy Greaves and Terry Venables. Crewe were then again drawn against the eventual double-winning Spurs side, who won 5\u20131 in the fourth round at White Hart Lane.", "As an early professional club in the late 19th century, several Crewe players achieved international selection, particularly for Wales. During the 20th century, however, Crewe had few stars. Welsh international Fred Keenor played his final league games for the club and his last international cap was Crewe's first of the century. Some players started or developed their careers at Crewe before achieving fame elsewhere. For example, forward Frank Blunstone played 48 League games for Crewe in the early 1950s before a move to Chelsea and five England caps, Stan Bowles scored 18 Crewe goals in 51 games in the early 1970s and went on to play for Queens Park Rangers and England, and goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar played 24 Crewe matches at the start of the 1980s before moving to Liverpool."]}, {"page": "Crewe", "response": ["From the early 1980s, Crewe Alexandra built a reputation for developing young players through its youth ranks: England internationals Geoff Thomas, Danny Murphy, David Platt, Rob Jones and Dean Ashton, plus  Northern Ireland's Neil Lennon and Steve Jones, and Wales's Robbie Savage and David Vaughan all passed through the club. Among their earlier most notable home-grown players was Frank Blunstone, born in the town in 1934, who was transferred from \"The Alex\" to Chelsea in 1953, and went on to win five England caps.

This is so due to the rivalry between the Gunners and the Blues being non existent at the time. Upon Drake's arrival at Chelsea, he made a series of sweeping changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous amateurish, music hall image. He discarded the club's Chelsea pensioner crest and with it the Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new one be adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club's previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable players.

However, Docherty added Frank Blunstone and Tommy Cavanagh to his coaching team soon after, and the arrival of Blunstone and Cavanagh saw Crerand sidelined in Docherty's team.

A dispute with manager Tommy Docherty saw Malcolm hand in a transfer request. This was declined,  but a move to Third Division club Queens Park Rangers for \u00a310,000 was to come in October 1962.
