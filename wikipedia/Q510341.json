No one has ever written better than she does here about the English upper-class cult of fox-hunting pre-1914...'.Cover notes, 2002 p/b edition, publ. Vintage and The Telegraph was similarly effusive, 'It is a beautiful, resonant book about a hidden world ... The charm of this strange, haunting novel lies in her extraordinary ability not merely to describe, but to convey the very texture of whatever she is writing about ... She inhabits not just human skins but those of horse, hound and fox. At times she even contrives to become the landscape across which all these creatures enact their drama of pursuit.' The review concludes: 'It is a piece of virtuosity that should be required reading for anyone who wishes to understand hunting, rather than merely hold a prejudice about it.'To feel the thrill of the chase, The Telegraph, 18 Aug 2001 In start contrast, Alfred Hickling in The Guardian complains 'what strikes you most about Rosalind Belben's evocation of early 20th-century countryfolk is her cacophonously awful prose. She frequently lapses into incomprehensible rural jargon \u2013 one chapter is bafflingly entitled \"Breaking off and the Poultry-Fund Certifier\". I had begun to hope that it was a Stella Gibbons-style parody, but the stoic humourlessness suggests she might be in earnest.'His house, hounds and New Labour, The Guardian, Saturday 14 December 2002", "Characters from Hound Music appear in Belben's next novel Our Horses in Egypt set twenty years later.The travails of one woman and her horse, Jane Shilling reviews Our Horses in Egypt by Rosalind Belben, The Telegraph, 25 Feb 2007"]}]}}
