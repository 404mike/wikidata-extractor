It was the third and final DreamWorks Animation film co-produced with Aardman Animations following Chicken Run (2000) and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005), and was the first Aardman project completely made in CGI animation as opposed to their usual stop-motion. The film stars the voices of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Shane Richie, Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis, Ian McKellen and Jean Reno. In Flushed Away, a pampered pet mouse named Roddy St. James is flushed down the toilet by Sid, a sewer rat, and befriends a sewer scavenger named Rita Malone in order to get back home while evading a sinister toad and his rat henchman.", "The idea for a film about rats that fall in love in sewers was proposed by animator Sam Fell during the production of Aardman Animation's Chicken Run (2000). At the time, Aardman encouraged everyone at the company to come up with ideas for features for the DreamWorks partnership. In 2001, Fell, development executive Mike Cooper, and producer Peter Lord then developed the concept into a story before pitching it to DreamWorks. The film was first announced in July 2002, and in what was then a surprise move, it was revealed as being Aardman's very first CGI feature project. Lord described the pitch as \"The African Queen with the gender roles reversed\". After the film was announced, Comic writing duo Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were contracted to write the script, which had the working title Ratropolis.

It's refreshing not to have to qualify the movie's appeal by appending the words, 'for the kids'.\" Jan Stuart of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying \"Despite the efforts of five writers and Aardman's trademark puppets, with their malleable eyebrows and cheeks bulging like those of a mumps sufferer, none of these characters are particularly endearing.\" Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying \"Flushed Away, Aardman's first computer-generated cartoon, does away with the clay but leaves the craft and emotion intact, resulting in a film that earns its place among the Aardman classics.\" Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"The short attention spans of directors David Bowers and Sam Fell are mostly forgivable because the movie is filled with so many entertaining characters.\"", "Category:Films directed by David Bowers"]}, {"page": "List of film director and composer collaborations", "response": ["David Bowers"]}, {"page": "List of animators", "response": ["* David Bowers"]}, {"page": "Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature", "response": ["|Flushed Away || David Bowers and Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "John Ottman", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\"| David Bowers"]}, {"page": "Poynton High School", "response": ["*David Bowers, film director"]}, {"page": "Annecy International Animation Film Festival", "response": ["|David Bowers and Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "34th Annie Awards", "response": ["* David Bowers & Sam Fell \u2013 Flushed Away \u2013 DreamWorks Animation & Aardman Features"]}, {"page": "60th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Flushed Away \u2013 David Bowers and Sam Fell"]}, {"page": "David Bowers", "response": ["David Bowers may refer to:", "* David Bowers (director) (born 1970), British animator and film director", "* Q.
