Evidently they thought the song still had some mileage, and it was even issued with an exact replica of O'chi's club mix for the Rick Astley club mix. Similarly, many of their songs were tried out and recorded by multiple artists; Mel and Kim, Pepsi and Shirlie and Sinitta all recorded the song \"Who's Gonna Catch You\", both Kylie Minogue and Mandy Smith recorded \"Got To Be Certain\", whilst Mel and Kim, Carol Hitchcock and Hazell Dean all laid down vocals for \"More Than Words Can Say\". Their prodigious, production line-like output and similar song structures led to them being referred to as the \"hit factory\" (not to be confused with the record label of the same name or the New York City recording studio The Hit Factory) and attracted criticism from many quarters, including the Guardian newspaper who unflatteringly dubbed the team, \"Schlock, Aimless and Waterdown\". However, Pete Waterman defended their style by comparing it to the output of Motown in the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Rick Astley", "response": ["Astley's next single was \"Whenever You Need Somebody\", which was released in October.
