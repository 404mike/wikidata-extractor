He scored 1,371 runs at an average of 37.05 and took 98 wickets at 21.48. His season began with a probable dispute over the Surrey captaincy. H. D. G. Leveson Gower had been appointed captain for 1908 but the combination of an injury and his marriage left him unavailable for four matches near the beginning of the season. Crawford also missed the beginning of the season; a newspaper article by Albert Trott, a former Australian Test all-rounder then playing for Middlesex, suggested that Crawford withdrew from the team because he was not appointed captain in Leveson Gower's absence. Instead Harry Bush, who had not played first-class cricket for five years, led the team. Trott was sympathetic to Crawford, stating that the Surrey committee went out of their way \"to inflict a most undeserved slight\" on Crawford.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1258."]}, {"page": "Frederick Bush", "response": ["He was brother of another Surrey County cricketer, Harry Bush."]}, {"page": "Harry Bush", "response": ["Harry Bush may refer to:", "*Harry Bush (artist) (1925\u20131994), American erotic artist", "*Harry Bush (English cricketer) (1871\u20131942), English first-class cricketer", "*Harry Bush (American cricketer) (born 1989), American first-class cricketer"]}]}}
