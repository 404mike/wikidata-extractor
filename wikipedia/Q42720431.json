At a mass rally in  Trafalgar Square on 3 April 1910, Sanderson was one of the main speakers focussing on 'politics', with fellow activists Muriel Matters and Emma Sproson; at an open air meeting in Regent's Park where she was reported to have 'held the crowd as much by her earnestness as by her logical arguments'. In June 2010, ten Scottish branches of WFL were represented in the 'great procession' of ten or twelve thousand women, seven hundred banners and forty bands; Sanderson was grouped with the 617 'prisoners' or 'martyrs' proceeding to Hyde Park. The Scottish banner said 'What's guid for John is guid for Janet'."]}, {"page": "Alice Schofield Coates", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alice Schofield"]}, {"page": "Schofield, Alice", "response": ["#redirectAlice Schofield"]}]}}
