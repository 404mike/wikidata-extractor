His main work was on the theory of equations, where he was reluctant to accept the validity of the work of Niels Henrik Abel on the insolubility of the quintic equation by radicals.  He found a way of using Tschirnhaus transformations to eliminate three of the terms in an equation, which generalised work of Erland Bring (1736\u20131798), and is now called Bring\u2013Jerrard normal form.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bring radical", "response": ["George Jerrard showed that some quintic equations can be solved in closed form using radicals and Bring radicals, which had been introduced by Erland Bring."]}, {"page": "Erland Samuel Bring", "response": ["Bring had developed an important transformation to simplify a quintic equation to the form x^5 + px + q = 0 (see Bring radical).
