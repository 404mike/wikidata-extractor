In a lengthy playing career, Alexander represented Scunthorpe United, Luton Town, Preston North End and Burnley.

He is the fourth oldest player to score in Premier League history. He was also a penalty kick specialist. On 16 April 2011, in Burnley's win over Swansea City in a Championship match, Alexander became only the second outfield player in English football history to have made 1,000 professional appearances, after Tony Ford.

Alexander's first game in charge was a 0\u20130 draw away to Barnsley on 25 March, followed by an emphatic 6\u20130 home victory over Swindon Town a week later. Alexander's appointment continued the revival of Scunthorpe's season which had originated with Robins' departure.

United climbed into the top 6 of League One with a 0\u20134 away victory over Plymouth Argyle on 26 August 2017. The club remained in a play-off spot for the majority of the season, however a disastrous run of form throughout February and March threw the Iron's play-off hopes into jeopardy. On 24 March 2018, following a 1\u20131 home draw against Rochdale, Graham Alexander was removed from his position as manager, leaving the club 5th in League One, but without a victory in 8 games. The duo of Nick Daws and Andy Dawson regained their positions of Caretaker Manager and Assistant Caretaker Manager respectively, as they had done in 2016 prior to Alexander's appointment. The Iron slipped down to 9th in the League One standings as Daws and Dawson failed to record victories in their first two games in charge, however a 0\u20131 away victory over fellow play-off hopefuls Charlton Athletic was sufficient to propel Scunthorpe back up to 6th place. Three consecutive wins followed, with United securing their play-off position on 1 May 2018 with the final of these three victories (a 2\u20130 home win over Plymouth Argyle). Scunthorpe finished the season in 5th place meaning that the Iron were drawn against Rotherham United in the play-off semi-final. Despite holding the millers to a 2\u20132 draw in the first leg at Glanford Park, Scunthorpe were once again denied a trip to Wembley with a 2\u20130 away loss in the second leg.
