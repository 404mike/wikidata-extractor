He was Professor Emeritus, University of London, from 1990. An immunologist, he was the co-discoverer, with Peter Medawar and Rupert Billingham, of acquired immunological tolerance. They injected cells from donor mice into fetal mice, and later neonatal mice, which would as adults receive donor skin grafts without rejection.\n\nBrent was born Lothar Baruch, in K\u00f6slin, Germany (now Koszalin, Poland), to German Jewish parents, Charlotte (Rosenthal) and Arthur Baruch. To avoid persecution in the largely non-Jewish K\u00f6slin, his family placed him in the Jewish Orphanage Berlin-Pankow in Berlin in 1936. In 1938, at age 13, to escape the rising anti-Semitism of the Sturmabteilung (Storm Troopers) and teachers, Brent was sent to England on the first of the Kindertransports and became a pupil at Anna Essinger's Bunce Court School. His parents and older sister stayed behind in Germany. Because his status as a German national would have made him liable to execution in the event of capture, he was advised to change his name. After the war, he found out that his parents were sent to Riga, Latvia, and executed. There are three stolpersteine for his parents and sister in Berlin. After the war, he became a British citizen and enrolled at University of Birmingham where he was president of the Guild of Undergraduates in 1950\u20131951. He received his Ph.D. at University College London.\nAs a secular Jew who escaped the Holocaust, Brent was highly critical of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.In 2012 he was interviewed and filmed for the documentary The Essential Link: The Story of Wilfrid Israel by Yonatan Nir, in which he talked about his Kindertransport experience.\nHe was a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and an honorary member of the British Society for Immunology.Brent died in December 2019, at the age of 94. He was posthumously appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to Holocaust education.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Koszalin", "response": ["* Leslie Brent (1925\u20132019), immunologist and zoologist"]}, {"page": "Peter Medawar", "response": ["Medawar was the youngest child of a Lebanese father and a British mother, and was both a Brazilian and British citizen by birth. He studied at Marlborough College and Magdalen College, Oxford, and was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London. Until he was partially disabled by a cerebral infarction, he was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill. With his doctoral student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert E. Billingham, he demonstrated the principle of acquired immunological tolerance (the phenomenon of unresponsiveness of the immune system to certain molecules), which was theoretically predicted by Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet. This became the foundation of tissue and organ transplantation. He and Burnet shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discovery of acquired immunological tolerance\".", "Medawar's involvement with what became transplant research began during World War II, when he investigated possible improvements in skin grafts. His first publication on the subject was \"Sheets of Pure Epidermal Epithelium from Human Skin\", which was published in Nature in 1941. His studies particularly concerned solution for skin wounds among soldiers in the war. In 1947, he moved to the University of Birmingham, taking along with him his PhD student Leslie Brent and postdoctoral fellow Rupert Billingham. His research became more focused in 1949, when Australian biologist Frank Macfarlane Burnet, at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, advanced the hypothesis that during embryonic life and immediately after birth, cells gradually acquire the ability to distinguish between their own tissue substances on the one hand and unwanted cells and foreign material on the other."]}, {"page": "Brent (name)", "response": ["* Leslie Brent (1925\u20132019), German immunologist"]}, {"page": "Macfarlane Burnet", "response": ["Burnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's hypothesis in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance,Biographical Memoirs, p. 134. thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite their rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.Sexton (1999), p. 137."]}, {"page": "List of Polish Jews", "response": ["* Leslie Brent, immunologist "]}, {"page": "Kindertransport", "response": ["* Leslie Brent (from Germany), British immunologist"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Leslie BrentThe Times, 6/7/06 p34: \"A Call by Jews in Britain\" (advert signed by 300 British Jews)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Birmingham alumni", "response": ["* Leslie Brent, immunologist and zoologist"]}, {"page": "History and naming of human leukocyte antigens", "response": ["Medawar continued his work, this time with a team of three at the University College London during the 1950s.
