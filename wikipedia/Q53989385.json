The first class of women to study at the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women consisted of eight students, the youngest of whom was nineteen years of age. Throughout its twelve years in operation, the school struggled to find financial funding to remain open. A  rival institution, the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women, set up by  Elsie Inglis with the help of her father John Inglis,  attracted several students of Jex-Blake, including Martha Cadell and  Grace Cadell. St Mungo's College and Queen Margaret College in Glasgow also accepted women medical students and when the Scottish universities began to do so the Edinburgh School of Medicine could no longer compete. The school closed in 1898. Over the twelve years of its operation, the Edinburgh School of Medicine provided education to approximately eighty female students.

She returned to Sydney in 1901 and set up in private practice in Darlinghurst Road but although she gave free medical advice she was forced to give up her practice because of the then common prejudices against female doctors. She briefly worked at Callan Park, the hospital for the Insane before leaving in 1905 to take over the practice of a woman doctor in Wellington, New Zealand. This time the practice thrived. She was chief medical officer at St Helens maternity hospital, and honorary physician, with Dr Daisy Platts-Mills, to the children's ward of Wellington Hospital from 1912.

At the time women were not admitted to either theoretical or practical classes at Edinburgh University although they could sit for examinations. To overcome these difficulties the pioneer of medical education for women Sophia Jex-Blake established the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women in Surgeons' Square in 1886. Professor Macadam took over the teaching of chemistry there before starting his own classes for women at Surgeons Hall in 1887. The first set of women medical students he taught in this pioneering role included a number going on to be medical missionaries. He also taught chemistry at the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women which had been established in Chambers Street by John Inglis and his daughter Elsie Inglis. These classes were in addition to his large classes of male medical and dental students at Surgeons Hall for the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and for Edinburgh University. Later he appointed his daughter Elison Ann Macadam, who he had taught, to be an assistant to him in Surgeons Hall so there was a woman assistant and not only his male assistants to make his classes seem more welcoming to women and also show that it was not just men who were qualified for the work (Elison Macadam, after his death, went on to become the first woman to graduate from King's College, London).Memories of Her Edinburgh Childhood by Mrs. Cecil H.
