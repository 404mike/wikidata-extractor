Up until 1891 he appeared in three further internationals against Wales and was capped twice against Scotland. He captained his country for the last of his seven internationals, when England took on Scotland at Ewood Park. When not playing for England he occupied the goals for both Old Westminsters and the Corinthians.\nA solicitor by profession, Moon was also a capable cricketer and played as a hard hitting wicket-keeper batsman.
