Second D\u00e1il TDs had taken an oath of fidelity to the Irish Republic, and Sinn F\u00e9in regarded those who implicitly or explicitly endorsed the Treaty or Free State constitution as having violated this oath and thereby vacated their seats. In 1926 de Valera founded Fianna F\u00e1il to take a more pragmatic opposition than Sinn F\u00e9in to the Free State, and the following year the party abandoned abstentionism by entering the Free State D\u00e1il. Fianna F\u00e1il TD Se\u00e1n Lemass famously described it in March 1928 as \"a slightly constitutional party\". De Valera came to power in 1932 and in 1937 proposed a new Constitution which was adopted by plebiscite, removing to his own satisfaction any remaining reservations about the state's legitimacy. In December 1938, seven of those elected in 1921 who continued to regard the Second D\u00e1il as the last legitimate D\u00e1il assembly, and that all other surviving members had disqualified themselves by taking the oath of allegiance, gathered at a meeting with the IRA Army Council under Se\u00e1n Russell, and signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council until such a time as a new D\u00e1il could once again be democratically elected by all the people of Ireland in all 32 counties.The seven were John J. O'Kelly, George Noble Plunkett, William Stockley, Mary MacSwiney, Brian O'Higgins, Tom Maguire and Cathal \u00d3 Murchadha. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic. Official Sinn F\u00e9in in 1969\u201370 and Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in in 1986 abandoned abstentionism and began a gradual  recognition of the legitimacy of the modern Irish state; the smaller Republican Sinn F\u00e9in retains the view that the Second D\u00e1il was the last legitimate Irish legislature."]}, {"page": "Daniel O'Connell", "response": ["(O'Connell's view of the link between nation and faith is one that a number of Protestant Irish nationalists in converting to Catholicism may have embraced: Repealer and O'Connell's mayoral secretary William O'Neill Daunt, Home Ruler Joseph Biggar, Gaelic Leaguer William Gibson, Sinn F\u00e9iner William Stockley, and, on the day of his execution, Roger Casement)."]}, {"page": "Protestant Irish nationalists", "response": ["* William Stockley"]}, {"page": "Anglo-Irish Treaty D\u00e1il vote", "response": ["|William Stockley"]}, {"page": "William F.

Since the 1890s, interest in the old Gaelic culture had grown, giving rise in the following decades to a political movement seeking independence from Britain.

In 1916 Aloys Fleischmann was interned as a civilian prisoner of war, at first in Oldcastle, County Meath, and from May 1918 on the Isle of Man.
