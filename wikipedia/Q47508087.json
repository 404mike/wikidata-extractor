He was regularly employed by the civil engineer Sir John Kelk to design the homes and public buildings he funded. Johnson is best known for his collaboration with Alfred Meeson on designs for Alexandra Palace in north London; his designs for the Church of St Edward the Confessor in Romford, Essex; and for the Grade I listed St Mary's Church in Tidworth, Wiltshire, which was completed the year he died.\nOne of Johnson's churches \u2013 St Luke's Church, Euston Road \u2013 was bought by Midland Railway and dismantled to make way for St Pancras railway station. It was re-erected by Johnson in Wanstead where it became Wanstead United Reformed Church.
