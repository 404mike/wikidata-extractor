He had a prolific career in the area during the 20th century, both on his own and as part of the Denman & Son firm in partnership with his son John Bluet Denman.  Described as \"the master of ... mid-century Neo-Georgian\", Denman was responsible for a range of commercial, civic and religious buildings in Brighton, and pubs and hotels there and elsewhere on the south coast of England on behalf of Brighton's Kemp Town Brewery.  He used other architectural styles as well, and was responsible for at least one mansion, several smaller houses, various buildings in cemeteries and crematoria, and alterations to many churches.  His work on church restorations has been praised, and he has been called \"the leading church architect of his time in Sussex\"; he also wrote a book on the ecclesiastical architecture of the county.\nDenman often worked with sculptor Joseph Cribb, whose carved reliefs (including one depicting Denman himself) adorn several of his buildings.  As a long-serving member of the Brighton School of Art\u2014where he was head of the Architecture department\u2014he also influenced the careers of former pupils who were later associated with the large group of artists who lived and worked in nearby Ditchling, where Cribb was based.  English Heritage has awarded some of Denman's works listed status in view of their architectural importance: among them are an elaborate Byzantine Revival mausoleum, an \"elegant\" Neo-Georgian office building and a pair of ceremonial stone pylons on the city boundary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Seaford, East Sussex", "response": ["Parts of the nave, aisles and clerestory of the Church of England parish church of St Leonard are Norman work from the 11th century.

Over 1,000 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged by bombs during the Brighton Blitz and other wartime raids, and nearly 11,000 others suffered some damage; and slum clearance programmes started in the 1930s resumed in the 1950s.  \"The serious \u2026 shortage was tackled with vigour\" by Brighton Corporation, which developed several estates of council housing in the 1950s: as well as Coldean, extensive building work took place at Bevendean, Hollingbury, Hollingdean and Woodingdean.  About 500 prefab houses were put up throughout the town, including in Coldean; but permanent houses were preferred, and the Corporation started to develop Coldean from 1950\u2014mostly with semi-detached houses, which make up more than half of the housing stock.

It is a simple flint building with dressings of Caen stone, originally with a thatched roof, and is similar to other downland churches in Sussex.  Lord of the manor Richard Bellingham, who built Hangleton Manor, is commemorated by a memorial in the chancel.  Situated in a \"bleak and isolated spot\", it only reopened fully in 1949 after a long period with infrequent services.  It has been separately parished since 1955.  St Richard's Church, a brown-brick building designed by architects Carden and Godfrey, opened in 1961 to serve the southern part of Hangleton known as The Knoll.  In the mid-1990s it was converted into a combined church and community centre.  Between 1932 and 1961 The Knoll had been served by a combined church and hall within the parish of St Leonard's Church, Aldrington.  It became part of Hangleton parish in 1955.  The Hounsom Memorial United Reformed Church was built in 1938 to the design of Brighton architect John Leopold Denman.  It was founded by the Sussex Congregational Union and Cliftonville Congregational Church in central Hove; Hangleton was identified as a good location for a new Congregational church because it was developing rapidly and no Nonconformist church had yet been provided.  The Baptist church on Hangleton Way was built in 1957 as Hangleton Free Church.  It was founded by members of Holland Road Baptist Church in central Hove.  Later names included The Vine Fellowship and Oasis Church; it is now called Emmanuel Church.", "Hangleton Manor Inn occupies the 16th-century manor house and is a Grade II* listed building.

The pub is operated by Mitchells & Butlers under their \"Sizzling Pubs\" brand.  Tamplin's Brewery of Brighton bought land for a pub at the north end of the estate in 1948, and The Downsman opened in 1956.

The Mill House Inn at the south end of Mile Oak, close to Portslade village, opened on Mill Lane in 1950 for the Tamplins Brewery of Brighton.
