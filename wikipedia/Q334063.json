He has the distinction of having served as leader of three political parties: as Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons (1875\u20131880), of the Liberal Unionist Party (1886\u20131903) and of the Unionists in the House of Lords (1902\u20131903). After 1886 he increasingly voted with the Conservatives. He declined to become prime minister on three occasions, because the circumstances were never right. Historian Roy Jenkins said he was \"too easy-going and too little of a party man.\" He held some passions, but he rarely displayed them regarding the most controversial issues of the day.", "link_mentions": {}}}
