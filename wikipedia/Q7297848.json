Minshull signed for Liverpool in 1946 and made 6 appearances during the 1946\u201347 season. He was never able to cement his place in the first-team ahead of regular goalkeeper Cyril Sidlow and left the club in 1951 to join SouthportRay Minshull died in 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cyril Sidlow", "response": ["Sidlow's career was curtailed because of the Second World War which began when he was approaching his 24th birthday, having taken away the best years of his career he was almost 31 when he signed for the Reds. Sidlow with Charlie Ashcroft and Ray Minshull were the goalkeepers vying for the number one jersey at Anfield for the 1946/47 season; the first competitive  season following the war. Even with the competition, Sidlow was given the position, which he held for 34 of the 42 games in a season that saw Liverpool win their first championship for 24 years. Much of which is owed to Sidlow as the final game of the season was a must win for the Reds. Sidlow's former employers Wolves needed just a point to win the title and Liverpool had to face them at Molineux. the Reds were a point back on their hosts and, needed a victory to win the league title. After a comprehensive 5\u20130 win at Anfield, Wolves were favourites to win the game and take the title, but goals from Jack Balmer and Albert Stubbins, plus Sidlow and the backline keeping Wolves down to one meant the Championship trophy would be heading to Merseyside."]}, {"page": "Paul Lodge", "response": ["Tutored by Colin Harvey and Ray Minshull, Lodge started his career with Everton, as the \"Toffees\" hovered above the First Division relegation zone in 1979\u201380 and 1980\u201381. Manager Gordon Lee was then sacked, and was replaced by Howard Kendall, who took the club to just one place off European football in 1981\u201382. Lodge was loaned out to Larry Lloyd's Wigan Athletic and Emlyn Hughes's Rotherham United in 1982\u201383. He scored one goal in five Third Division games for the struggling \"Latics\", and played four Second Division for the soon to be relegated \"Millers\". His brief spells at Springfield Park and Millmoor failed to reignite his career, and he was transferred to Third Division side Preston North End later in the season, in a move that reunited him with Gordon Lee. Lodge had played 24 league games for Everton in his four years at Goodison Park."]}, {"page": "Football League Third Division North versus South representative matches", "response": ["| Ray Minshull", "| Ray Minshull"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Ray Minshull"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Ray Minshull"]}, {"page": "Minshull", "response": ["*Ray Minshull (born 1920), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Ray Minshull"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["* Ray Minshull"]}, {"page": "Wilf Birkett", "response": ["Birkett was born in Haydock, Lancashire, in 1922. He joined Everton from Haydock Cricket and Bowling Club during the Second World War, but never played for their first team, and moved on to Southport in November 1946. He spent six years at Southport, then lost his place to Ray Minshull and signed for a season with Shrewsbury Town. Returning to Southport in 1953, he regained his first-team place but was forced to retire on medical advice because his right shoulder was prone to dislocation. He remained at the club as assistant trainer for four years, and then spent 12 years as trainer at non-league club Wigan Athletic. He played for them occasionally, notably in the first round proper of the 1962\u201363 FA Cup against Gateshead; Wigan lost 2\u20131. Birkett died at his Haydock home in 1993 at the age of 71."]}]}}
