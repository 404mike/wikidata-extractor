Meanwhile, Lester had to deal with an old rival Christine Johnson (Belinda Stewart-Wilson), an unscrupulous government official who hoped to obtain the power of the anomalies and the Future Predators for military uses. With the assistance of Sarah Page (Laila Rouass), a professor employed at the British Museum, Cutter begins to piece together a map of all anomalies, based on folklore, and begins using them to make predictions about where anomalies will occur next. Helen tries to invade the ARC with an army of cleaner clones (including a clone of Cutter), with the intention of killing the real Cutter to stop his research causing the downfall of life on Earth. Cutter takes an artefact from Helen, and is shot and killed by her in the process, with his \"prediction map\" being completely destroyed. Connor obtains the artefact and discovers that it was in fact a map similar to the one devised by Cutter to predict anomalies. However, they are not able to get it to work, but they do manage to create a device to lock anomalies and prevent creatures coming through. Danny Quinn (Jason Flemyng), a former police detective who became involved after discovering his brother had been killed by a creature from the future, becomes the team leader following Cutter's death, while Jenny departs after having nearly died, and realising that Cutter's talk of Claudia Brown was in fact all true after seeing his photo of her. Connor and Abby's relationship grows, despite her brother Jack moving into her flat and going through an anomaly to the future.
