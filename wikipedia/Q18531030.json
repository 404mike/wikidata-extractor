During his lifetime, he was well known in London antiquarian and literary circles for his talent for paleography and archiving. He was the member of many historical societies, and the founder of three more. He published numerous articles and books, during his lifetime, with more published posthumously.\nBlack was lesser known, but equally regarded, for his prominence in London Seventh-Day Baptist circles, leading a small congregation in London, which never held more than twenty people. This circle was the subject of a newspaper article in 1869, where the reporter wrote of the contrast between the dilapidated building the services were held in, and their leader, Black, who appeared as \"a profound scholar and most courteous gentleman\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Black", "response": ["* William Henry Black (1808\u20131872), English antiquarian and Seventh Day Baptist leader"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Society of Antiquaries of London", "response": ["*William Henry Black (1808\u20131872)"]}, {"page": "W.
