Gilbert originally conceived Patience as a tale of rivalry between two curates and of the doting ladies who attended upon them. The plot and even some of the dialogue were lifted straight out of Gilbert's Bab Ballad \"The Rival Curates.\" While writing the libretto, however, Gilbert took note of the criticism he had received for his very mild satire of a clergyman in The Sorcerer, and looked about for an alternative pair of rivals. Some remnants of the Bab Ballad version do survive in the final text of Patience. Lady Jane advises Bunthorne to tell Grosvenor: \"Your style is much too sanctified \u2013 your cut is too canonical!\"  Later, Grosvenor agrees to change his lifestyle by saying, \"I do it on compulsion!\" \u2013 the very words used by the Reverend Hopley Porter in the Bab Ballad.  Gilbert's selection of aesthetic poet rivals proved to be a fertile subject for topsy-turvy treatment.  He both mocks and joins in Buchanan's criticism of what the latter calls the poetic \"affectations\" of the \"fleshly school\" \u2013 their use of archaic terminology, archaic rhymes, the refrain, and especially their \"habit of accenting the last syllable in words which in ordinary speech are accented on the penultimate.\"  All of these poetic devices or \"mediaevalism's affectations\", as Bunthorne calls them, are parodied in Patience.  For example, accenting the last syllable of \"lily\" and rhyming it with \"die\" parodies two of these devices at once.Williams, p. 175, discussing the parody of poetic styles in Patience, including Gilbert's satiric use of the poetic devices criticised in Robert Williams Buchanan's essay \"The Fleshly School of Poetry\", The Contemporary Review, October 1871."]}, {"page": "Augustus Harris", "response": ["*A Sailor and His Lass (Robert Williams Buchanan) 1883"]}, {"page": "1901 in poetry", "response": ["* June 10 \u2013 Robert Williams Buchanan, 59, Scottish poet, novelist and dramatist"]}, {"page": "1871 in poetry", "response": ["* \"Thomas Maitland\" (i.e., Robert Williams Buchanan) attacks Dante Gabriel Rossetti and other members of what Buchanan calls the \"Fleshly School\" of English poetry in The Contemporary Review (October); and Rossetti replies in \"The Stealthy School of Criticism\" in the Athenaeum (December 16)"]}, {"page": "1841 in poetry", "response": ["* August 18 \u2013 Robert Williams Buchanan (died 1901), Scottish"]}, {"page": "1865 in poetry", "response": ["* Robert Williams Buchanan, \"The Session of the Poets,\" an attack on Algernon Charles Swinburne, published in The Spectator"]}, {"page": "List of names in A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Rationalists", "response": ["* Robert Williams Buchanan"]}, {"page": "Buchanan (surname)", "response": ["* Robert Williams Buchanan (1841\u20131901), British poet, dramatist, and novelist"]}]}}
