The story opens well, but tails off rather weakly. However, the production is varied in interest and, as a whole, makes a fairly satisfactory entertainment of a class which is always welcome.\" According to the reviewer, \"Guy Newall's direction of individual scenes is always intelligent and artistic, and often original. The photography by Hal Young is generally excellent, especially in the coast scenes, a few of which are real gems of screen art,\" and the acting good, but \"the solution of the 'murder' mystery is in the nature of an anti-climax, owing largely to the unconvincing and altogether inadequate staging of the wild pony's attack upon the heroine.\"\"'A Maid of the Silver Sea,\" The Bioscope, 9 Nov. 1922, 59-60."]}]}}
