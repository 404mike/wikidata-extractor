He was educated at the King's School, Gloucester, Hereford Cathedral School and St Edmund's School, Canterbury before matriculating at Keble College, Oxford to study mathematics.  After his first-year examinations, he switched to engineering, under Richard V. Southwell, and obtained a first-class degree in 1932.  He worked for the next five years for Metropolitan-Vickers in Manchester, initially as an apprentice and then as a design engineer.  In 1937, more interested in the science of engineering than production methods, he moved to the University of Liverpool as lecturer in electrical engineering; four years later, he moved again, to the University of Aberdeen, as lecturer in charge of electrical engineering and departmental head of Robert Gordon's Technical College (now Robert Gordon University).  In 1944, the University of Bristol appointed him Professor of Electrical Engineering, a post that he held for the next 31 years.  After retiring in 1975, he died in Bristol of a heart attack on 3 September 1979, brought on by the asthma that affected his health throughout his life."]}, {"page": "Richard Southwell (scientist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard V.

Whilst playing for Wasps (Rugby) Football Club he met Professor Sammy Sparkes, also of Imperial College, who persuaded him to study civil engineering as a post-graduate, and also Deryck Norman de Garrs Allen, who became his PhD supervisor.  Allen, who had studied under Sir Richard V. Southwell, was asked by Geoffrey Binnie's engineering consultancy to apply Southwell's equation-solving techniques to the design of the Dukan Dam in Iraq.  Allen involved Severn in the project, as part of which the pair visited several arch dams and spent a significant amount of time solving complex design equations on mechanical calculators via relaxation methods.  The project formed the basis of Severn's doctoral thesis."]}, {"page": "Sir Richard Vynne Southwell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard V.
