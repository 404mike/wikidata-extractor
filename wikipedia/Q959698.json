During the 18th century, soldiers, carpenters and other craftsmen working at The Royal Palace settled in the area. Intentions were to develop it into a suburb to the palace like at the Versailles Palace, and this end the area was granted the status of a city to attract entrepreneurs and artists to the royal court. During the reign of King Gustav III had several building erected, including the L\u00e5nga raden (the \"Long Row\") to accommodate the royal life guard. By 1815 78 properties existed in the area. However, it failed to develop in the direction sketched-out by Gustav III, and instead evolved into a summer residence area inhabited by wealthy burghers, the large-scales villas in a wide range of styles have given the area its characteristics. In the middle of the 20th century several buildings by well-known Swedish architects, including Nils Tesch, Ralph Erskine, Peter Celsing and Bengt Lindroos, were added.Sundstr\u00f6m"]}, {"page": "Milton Keynes", "response": ["Ralph Erskine, "]}, {"page": "Shopping mall", "response": ["The enclosed shopping center, which would eventually be known as the shopping mall, did not appear until the mid-1950s.
