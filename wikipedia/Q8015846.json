He accompanied James Stirling to the Swan River Colony and gathered material for the  Proteaceae found in the same institution's herbarium.Notices on Morrison's collections were published by Kew in 1880 and 1891,\n\n\"In founding Swan River Colony in 1828, Capt. Stirling, the Governor, took with him William Morrison, a gardener, who became a seed collector, and forwarded collections to this country for sale\" \nMorrison's name is associated with the common names of many verticordias, initially given to his early collection of Verticordia nitens. Morrison's featherflower was thought to have been named for Alexander Morrison, a Scottish surgeon of the colony, though it was shown by Rica Erickson that a Captain Seymour Meares, collecting for James Mangles, had used this label when he was unable to recall its scientific name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Morrison", "response": ["William Morrison may refer to:", "* William Morrison (poet) (1881\u20131973), Irish poet", "* Joseph Samachson or William Morrison (1906\u20131980), science-fiction writer", "* William Morrison (director), music video director and musician", "* William Morrison (trader) (19th century), fur trader in Old Crow Wing, Minnesota", "* William Morrison (businessman) (1874\u20131956), founder of supermarket chains", "* William Morrison (American politician), member of the North Carolina General Assembly of 1779", "* William Morrison (Alberta politician) (1891\u20131970), former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta", "* William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil (1893\u20131961), British politician and Governor General of Australia", "* William Morrison (Australian politician) (1928\u20132013), Member of the Australian House of Representatives", "* William Morrison (Canadian politician), politician in Lillooet, British Columbia", "* William Morrison (gardener), plant collector employed by Kew, 1824\u20131839", "* William Morrison (chemist) (1850-1927), inventor of the first practical electrical car", "* William Morrison (dentist) (1860\u20131926), American dentist", "* William Morrison (cricketer) (1850\u20131910), New Zealand cricketer", "* William Morrison (rugby union) (1875-1944), Scotland international rugby union player", "* William Morrison (missionary) (1867\u20131918), American missionary based in the Congo Free State"]}, {"page": "Morrison (surname)", "response": ["*William Morrison (Alberta politician), former member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta", "*William Morrison (businessman), founder of the Morrisons supermarket chain", "*William Morrison (dentist), American dentist", "*William Morrison (director), music video director and musician", "*William Morrison, 1st Viscount Dunrossil (1893\u20131961), British politician and Governor General of Australia", "*William Morrison (gardener), plant collector employed by Kew, 1824\u201339", "*William Morrison (missionary), American missionary based in the Congo Free State", "*William Morrison (trader), Canadian fur trader active in Minnesota", "*Joseph Samachson (1906\u20131980), biochemist and science-fiction writer under the pseudonym William Morrison"]}, {"page": "Verticordia nitens", "response": ["The name of early collector, William Morrison from Kew, was attached to V. nitens, and \"Morrison flower\" was extended to the common name for many similar and well known species. Morrison was asked by Seymour Meares, the son of Richard Goldsmith Meares, as the botanist Drummond was unavailable to him.> Meares' request from James Mangles was to deliver material for the cultivation of \"Chrysorhoe nitens\" in England, and unable to recall this name he applied that of the collector as a label.
