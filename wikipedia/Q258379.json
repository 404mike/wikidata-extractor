Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture (1869, revised 1870 and 1880) is a 15-minute symphonic poem, containing the famous melody known as the \"love theme\". Tchaikovsky's device of repeating the same musical theme at the ball, in the balcony scene, in Juliet's bedroom and in the tombRomeo and Juliet, I.v, II.ii, III.v, V.iii. has been used by subsequent directors: for example, Nino Rota's love theme is used in a similar way in the 1968 film of the play, as is Des'ree's \"Kissing You\" in the 1996 film. Other classical composers influenced by the play include Henry Hugh Pearson (Romeo and Juliet, overture for orchestra, Op. 86), Svendsen (Romeo og Julie, 1876), Delius (A Village Romeo and Juliet, 1899\u20131901), Stenhammar (Romeo och Julia, 1922), and Kabalevsky (Incidental Music to Romeo and Juliet, Op. 56, 1956)."]}, {"page": "Michelle Kwan", "response": ["* Kissing Youby Des'ree"]}, {"page": "1994 in music", "response": ["| I Ain't Movin' || Des'ree ||-"]}, {"page": "1996 in film", "response": ["| Romeo + Juliet || 20th Century Fox || Baz Luhrmann (director/screenplay); Craig Pearce (screenplay); Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, Diane Venora, Miriam Margolyes, Paul Rudd, Jesse Bradford, Harold Perrineau, Dash Mihok, Christina Pickles, M.
