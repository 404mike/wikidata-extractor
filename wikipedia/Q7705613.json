Finally, Clapton agreed to release the album in a limited edition. When Unplugged sold out, Clapton gave Warner Bros. and Reprise Records the permission to delete the limited album production. For the album, Clapton decided to record both new material like \"Lonely Stranger\" and old songs he grew up with such as \"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\" or enjoyed listening to or had written as an adult, like \"San Francisco Bay Blues\" and \"Layla\". Clapton, who plays acoustic guitar and sings on the live track, was backed by Andy Fairweather Low who played acoustic rhythm guitar, Nathan East on acoustic bass guitar and background vocals, Ray Cooper on percussion, Steve Ferrone on drums, Katie Kissoon and Tessa Niles on background vocals as well as Chuck Leavell on piano. Pianist Chuck Leavell recalled that recording the acoustic version of \"Layla\" felt natural to him and liked that the band was given some space to play during the body of the song and not just during the reprise like it is on the original recording. \"It gave us a chance to interpret the song in our way and it did work out well and it gave it a rebirth I think.\", Leavell said.
