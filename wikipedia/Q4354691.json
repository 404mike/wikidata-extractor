He was the naturalist on board HMS Blonde during its voyage around South America and the Pacific in 1824\u201326, where he collected mainly birds. Later as a Church of England minister he lived in Warwickshire and Leicestershire and made significant contributions to the study of the natural history of the area. His special interest was in fungi and the genera Rubus and Rosa.

Byron, commanding the British warship HMS Blonde, was returning to London from a special mission to Honolulu to repatriate the remains of the young king and queen of Hawaii, who had died of measles during a visit to Britain. The island was named after Lieutenant Charles Robert Malden, navigator of the Blonde, who sighted the island and briefly explored it.Dunmore, p 46 Andrew Bloxam, naturalist of the Blonde, and James Macrae, a botanist travelling for the Royal Horticultural Society, joined in exploring the island and recorded their observations.

Her book remains a primary source for the voyage and includes an account of the funeral ceremony for the monarchs of the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

The island of Mauke was not visited again by ornithologists until 1973, by which time the bird was extinct, presumably due to predation by introduced rats. Bloxam noted that in 1825, only two years after the arrival of the first Europeans, they \"saw quantities of rats with long tails, different in appearance from the common South Sea rat and resembling in colour and almost in size the Norway rat\". Thus, and considering the vulnerability of other Aplonis species to rat predation, it can be assumed that the species became extinct soon thereafter."]}, {"page": "Pueo", "response": ["This taxon was first named by Andrew Bloxam (as the species Strix sandwichensis).

This was the same year as Mary had the first draft of the Flora of Leicestershire published which she had created with the significant assistance of Andrew Bloxam and her sister who added supporting non-botanical information. The book was cleverly crowd-sourced in 1848 as every other page was left blank. The plan, which proved successful, was to ask early purchasers to make notes on the blank pages. This enabled the main edition published in 1850 to list 939 different species and the book was complimented by the leading naturalist Sir William Hooker. Mary is thought to be the only woman in the nineteenth century to write a book about the flora of her county."]}]}}
