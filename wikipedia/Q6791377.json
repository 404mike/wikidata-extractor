Cameron Mitchell after the SGC inadvertently draws the attention of the Ori to the existence of sentient life in the Milky Way; the Ori are revealed to be a faction of ascended Ancients residing in another galaxy that are diametrically opposed to the Ancients' belief in strict noninterference in the lower planes of existence, sapping the energy from untold billions of \"lower beings\" (non-ascended sentient beings) by means of their worship in a religion called Origin. While the Ori send enhanced human beings named Priors to the Milky Way to convert the galaxy to Origin, Ba'al and some minor Goa'uld infiltrate Earth through The Trust  (a coalition of rogue NID operatives) to rebuild their power. At the end of Season 9 (\"Camelot (Part 1)\"), the Ori begin an evangelistic crusade with their warships and effortlessly wipe out the combined fleet of Earth and its allies. The leader of the Ori, Adria (Morena Baccarin), is introduced in the premiere of Season 10 (\"Flesh and Blood (Part 2)\"). SG-1 searches for the Sangraal, an Ancient weapon that might defeat the Ori, while Ba'al and his clones attempt to find the weapon for their own purposes. With the help of the powerful Ancient Merlin (Matthew Walker), SG-1 finds the construction plans of the Sangraal and sends a working version to the Ori galaxy. Shortly thereafter, Adria ascends.

Known inmates are General Zod and later his genetic clone (portrayed by Callum Blue), Faora (portrayed by Sharon Taylor), Nam-Ek (portrayed by Leonard Roberts), Aethyr (portrayed by Alana de la Garza), Dr. Hudson (portrayed by Matthew Walker), Baern (portrayed by Bow Wow), Gloria (portrayed by Amber McDonald), Aldar (portrayed by Dave Bautista), Titan (portrayed by Kane), and Slade Wilson. Some of the inmates like Zod and Faora were stripped of their corporal bodies where they became phantoms. Outside of its glass-like entrance, the Phantom Zone resembles a desert-like wasteland that has a blue sun which doesn't set. In the 5th-season premiere \"Arrival\", Clark Kent battles two evil Kryptonians named Nam-Ek & Aethyr that are disciples of Zod. When he refuses to join them in their quest to subjugate Earth, the Kryptonians attempt to banish Clark to the Phantom Zone using a metallic bracelet (inscribed with Kryptonian symbols) that opens up a vortex. However, Clark manages to turn the tables, sending them into the portal to the Phantom Zone instead. Aside from its entrance, the Phantom Zone is represented as a floating black square, similar to its depiction in the Superman films. In the episode \"Solitude\", the Kryptonian artificial intelligence known as Brainiac (posing as Professor Milton Fine) manipulates Clark into believing that Jor-El is responsible for Martha's mysterious illness. This is all part of a plot to free the imprisoned General Zod. Professor Fine persuades Clark to take him to the Fortress of Solitude, where he gives Clark a black crystal and instructs him to insert it into the Fortress' control console, misleadingly saying that it will destroy Jor-El and therefore save Martha. The crystal, once inserted into the console, instead opens up a vortex in which another black square is seen, with a figure resembling General Zod as portrayed in the Superman movies, but Brainiac's plan is thwarted once Clark removes the crystal. In the episode \"Vessel\", General Zod is finally freed from the Phantom Zone. After inhabiting Lex Luthor, Zod traps Clark inside the Phantom Zone using a Kryptonian bracelet similar to the one used in the episode \"Arrival\". In the season premiere of the 6th season, the Phantom Zone itself is shown as a desolate wasteland where Clark is rendered powerless and mortal. It is revealed to have been created by Jor-El as a prison for not only Kryptonian convicts, but also criminals from the \"28 known galaxies\". The more dangerous prisoners (e.g. General Zod and Bizarro) are stripped of their corporeal forms and their spirits are then cast into the Phantom Zone. Clark escapes with the help of a Kryptonian woman named Raya (portrayed by Pascale Hutton) who claims to have known Jor-El and was placed in the Phantom Zone by Jor-El to protect her from Krypton's destruction. To ensure her survival, Jor-El sent Raya to the Phantom Zone just before the destruction of Krypton. Raya reveals that those of the blood of Jor-El's house can utilize a secret exit from the Phantom Zone, therefore Clark can leave. Upon escaping the Phantom Zone, Clark accidentally releases Raya and various prisoners and phantoms to Earth. Chloe Sullivan later refers to the escaped convicts as \"Zoners\" and Superman had to either eliminate them or send them back to the Phantom Zone. In the season 7 finale, \"Arctic\", it is revealed that Brainiac has trapped Kara in the Phantom Zone. In the season eight episode \"Bloodline\", Clark and Lois are both trapped in the Phantom Zone, where they are reunited with Kara. Also, Zod's wife Faora takes control of Lois' body so she can be set free by Kara, and goes on a rampage in Metropolis. In the season 10 episode \"Icarus\", Clark uses a crystal of El to send Slade Wilson to the Phantom Zone. When Wilson is found back on Earth in \"Dominion\", Clark and Oliver Queen enter the Phantom Zone to see how that escape was possible. They learn that the clone of Zod - who was sent to New Krypton with the others - was sent to the Phantom Zone for his crimes. While there, he merged with the phantom of the original Zod, gaining all of his memories, and a blood transfusion from Clark allowed him to send others out of the Phantom Zone. Clark departs the Phantom Zone with Green Arrow while destroying the control console on the Phantom Zone side in order to prevent anyone else from leaving."]}, {"page": "Spy Game", "response": ["* Matthew Walker as MI6 Agent Digby 'Digger' Gibson"]}, {"page": "Alone in the Dark (2005 film)", "response": ["* Matthew Walker as Professor Lionel Hudgens"]}, {"page": "Little Women (1994 film)", "response": ["* Matthew Walker as Robert March, the father of the four March daughters, Marmee's loving husband, and long-time devoted spouse."]}, {"page": "The Crush (1993 film)", "response": ["Adrian's crush on Nick intensifies, but he quickly wises up and attempts to put her off.
