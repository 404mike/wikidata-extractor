As a junior officer he took part in the capture of Acre during the Oriental Crisis in 1840 and, as Captain of HMS Cornwallis in the Baltic Fleet, he took part in the Bombardment of Sveaborg in August 1855 during the Crimean War. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station and then Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Squadron but was relieved of the latter post by a court-martial after an incident in which an armoured frigate, which had been under his command at the time, ran aground at Pearl Rock off Gibraltar in July 1871. He was appointed First Naval Lord in November 1877 and in that capacity he secured a considerable increase in naval construction, for example on the Colossus-class battleships, although some of these ships were of doubtful quality.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Earl of Mornington", "response": ["****George Wellesley (1814\u20131901)"]}, {"page": "North America and West Indies Station", "response": ["* Vice Admiral Sir George Wellesley (1869\u201370)", "* Vice Admiral Sir George Wellesley (1873\u201375)"]}, {"page": "Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington", "response": ["* Hon.
