His father was a needlemaker. The family moved to Nottingham in 1819, where Cubley saw the Reform Riots of 1831 and the burning of Nottingham Castle, and in 1834 moved again, to Newark-on-Trent. Cubley married Jane Spencer in 1838. He took lessons in London with Richard Rothwell, member of the Royal Hibernian Academy and former studio assistant to Sir Thomas Lawrence. Cubley also studied with Sir William Beechey, who had been a pupil of Reynolds. Cubley taught art in Grantham and Lincoln, and at Magnus Grammar School in Newark, where he was known as \"Old Cubley\" and where William Nicholson and William Caparne were his pupils. His influence on Nicholson was considerable: he gave him weekly drawing lessons, took him on painting trips in the country, and may have persuaded Nicholson's father to allow the boy to take up full-time study of art. Nicholson later painted a portrait of Cubley, which he described as \"a very bad portrait of a very good man\"; it is now in the Long Gallery of Nottingham Castle."]}, {"page": "L'Ancresse", "response": ["Artists who have painted L\u2019Ancresse include William Caparne and Paul Jacob Naftel."]}, {"page": "Caparne, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Caparne"]}]}}
