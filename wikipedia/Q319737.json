On 7 April, they visited the Ealing Jazz Club where they met the members of Blues Incorporated, who included slide guitarist Brian Jones, keyboardist Ian Stewart and drummer Charlie Watts. After a meeting with Korner, Jagger and Richards started jamming with the group.", "Jones, no longer in a band, advertised for bandmates in Jazz Weekly the week of 2 May 1962. Ian Stewart, the first to respond to the ad, found them a practice space; together they decided to form a band playing Chicago blues. In June, Jagger, Taylor and Richards left Blues Incorporated to join Jones and Stewart. The first rehearsal included guitarist Geoff Bradford and vocalist Brian Knight, both of whom decided not to join the band. They objected to playing the Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley songs preferred by Jagger and Richards. That same month the addition of the drummer Tony Chapman completed the line-up of Jagger, Richards, Jones, Stewart and Taylor. According to Richards, Jones named the band during a phone call to Jazz News. When asked by a journalist for the band's name, Jones saw a Muddy Waters LP lying on the floor; one of the tracks was \"Rollin' Stone\".", "Sticky Fingers cover was the first to feature the logo of Rolling Stones Records, which effectively became the band's logo. It consisted of a pair of lips with a lapping tongue. Designer John Pasche created the logo following a suggestion by Jagger to copy the out stuck tongue of the Hindu goddess Kali. Critic Sean Egan has said of the logo,  The tongue and lips design was part of a package that VH1 named the \"No.\u00a01 Greatest Album Cover\" of all time in 2003. The logo has remained on all the Stones' post-1970 albums and singles, in addition to their merchandise and stage sets. The album contains one of their best-known hits, \"Brown Sugar\", and the country-influenced \"Dead Flowers\". \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\" were recorded at Alabama's Muscle Shoals Sound Studio during the 1969 American tour. The album continued the band's immersion into heavily blues-influenced compositions. The album is noted for its \"loose, ramshackle ambience\" and marked Mick Taylor's first full release with the band. Sticky Fingers reached number one in both the UK and the US. The Stones' Decca catalogue is currently owned by Klein's ABKCO label. In 1968, the Stones, acting on a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control room in a van and created a mobile recording studio so they would not be limited to the standard 9\u20135 operating hours of most recording studios. The band lent the mobile studio to other artists, including Led Zeppelin, who used it to record Led Zeppelin III (1970) and Led Zeppelin IV (1971). Deep Purple immortalised the mobile studio itself in the song \"Smoke on the Water\" with the line \"the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside, making our music there\".", "In early 1989, the Stones, including Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood as well as Brian Jones and Ian Stewart (posthumously), were inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Heralded as a return to form, it included the singles \"Mixed Emotions\" (US No.\u00a05), \"Rock and a Hard Place\" (US No.\u00a023) and \"Almost Hear You Sigh\". The album also included \"Continental Drift\", which the Rolling Stones recorded in Tangier, Morocco in 1989 with the Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar, coordinated by Tony King and Cherie Nutting.

Unlike the prior two albums, the band was joined by some guest musicians, such as vocalist Sandy Denny on \"The Battle of Evermore\", and pianist Ian Stewart on \"Rock and Roll\".

Johns had just worked on engineering Sticky Fingers and recommended the mobile studio. Guitarist and producer Jimmy Page later recalled: \"We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do.\" This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band, as they were able to capture spontaneous performances immediately, with some tracks arising from the communal jamming.

The group's first appearance, under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite Muddy Waters tunes), was at the Marquee Club, a London jazz club, on 12\u00a0July 1962. They would later change their name to \"the Rolling Stones\" as it seemed more formal. Writer Victor Bockris says the band members included Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Ian Stewart on piano, Dick Taylor on bass and Tony Chapman on drums. However, Richards says in his memoir Life that \"The drummer that night was Mick Avory\u2013not Tony Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down...\" In June 1963, the band began a five month residency at Eel Pie Island Hotel, which the BBC later credited with shaping the band's career. By that autumn, Jagger had left the London School of Economics to pursue his promising musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group played songs by American rhythm and blues artists like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but strongly encouraged by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write songs. Their songwriting partnership took some time to develop; one of their early compositions was \"As Tears Go By\", a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting.  For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write \"The Last Time\", the group's third number one single in the UK (their first two UK number one hits being remakes of songs that had been recorded by other artists \"It's All Over Now\" by Bobby Womack and \"Little Red Rooster\" by Willie Dixon) based on \"This May Be the Last Time\", a traditional Negro spiritual song recorded by the Staple Singers in 1955. Jagger and Richards also wrote their first international hit, \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\".
