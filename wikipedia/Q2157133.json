While a librarian he wrote an essay for the Military Surgeon which won the Wellcome Prize for 1933. During this period he grew to fame as an amateur ornithologist and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1933. His proposers were Dr William Joseph Maloney, Joseph Wedderburn and fellow-Americans Robert Foster Kennedy and Richard Lightburn Sutton. Curiously he was an Ordinary Fellow rather than Honorary, which required his physical presence in Edinburgh for his induction. At the end of his term as Librarian, Hume was assigned to study at the Medical Field Service School at Carlisle Barracks before becoming Commanding Officer of the Winter General Hospital in Topeka, Kansas. Colonel Hume left the hospital to attend the School of Military Government in Charlottesville."]}]}}
