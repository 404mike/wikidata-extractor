He receives a letter from the killer, which leads to a shoebox containing a mobile phone, a handgun, and five origami figures. The killer calls him and explains that each of the figures contains instructions on how to complete tests that will determine how much Ethan loves his son. Every time he completes one, he will receive a piece of the address where Shaun is held. The tests include driving against traffic at speed on the highway, crawling through broken glass and activing electrical pylons, cutting off one of his fingers, murdering drug dealer Brad Silver, and drinking poison on camera. Ethan meets Madison Paige (Jacqui Ainsley/Judi Beecher), a journalist who sometimes uses the motel to deal with her insomnia. She decides to conduct her own investigation into the Origami Killer. Jayden and his partner Lieutenant Carter Blake investigate suspects, but nothing pans out until Grace arrives at the station, fearing that her former husband is involved in Shaun's disappearance. After Ethan's psychiatrist Conrad Dupre reveals that his patient has a history of blackouts, Blake and his superiors put out a warrant for his arrest. Unconvinced, Jayden continues to investigate other leads. Meanwhile, private investigator Scott Shelby (Sam Douglas) meets the families of the Origami Killer's victims, collecting the letters and other items they received when their loved ones were abducted. Prostitute Lauren Winter, the mother of a victim, persuades Scott to let her accompany him. Their investigation leads them to Gordi Kramer, who claims to be the killer, but when they try to question him, they are knocked out and wake up in a car sinking to the bottom of a river. After either saving or failing to rescue Lauren, Scott tracks down Gordi's father Charles and forces him to confess that his son was responsible for an incident years earlier in which a boy was killed.", "| Sam Douglas as Scott Shelby"]}, {"page": "Highlander: The Series (season 6)", "response": ["* Sam Douglas ...
