The estate was technologically advanced; the architect of the house, Richard Norman Shaw, wrote that it was equipped with \"wonderful hydraulic machines that do all sorts of things\". In the grounds, Armstrong built dams and lakes to power a sawmill, a water-powered laundry, early versions of a dishwasher and a dumb waiter, a hydraulic lift and a hydroelectric rotisserie.
