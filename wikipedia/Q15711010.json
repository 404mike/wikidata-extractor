Born in England, Hope represents Barbados internationally after representing England up to under-19 level.\nHe joined the Academy at Everton in 2005. He never played a senior game for the club, though spent brief loan spells at Northampton Town, Bury and Sheffield Wednesday in 2014, before joining Bury permanently in January 2015, who would end the 2014\u201315 season being promoted out of League Two. He spent most of the 2015\u201316 season on loan at Carlisle United, and after establishing himself in the Bury first-team during the 2016\u201317 campaign, he joined Carlisle United on a permanent basis in June 2017. He spent two-and-a-half seasons with the club, before joining Swindon Town in January 2020. Swindon went on to win promotion as champions of League Two at the end of the 2019\u201320 season, though his appearances were limited as the season was ended in early March.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McCombe", "response": ["McCombe signed for League Two club York City on 12 January 2014 on a two-and-a-half-year contract, after his release from Mansfield.

On 15 February 2014, he scored a brace and claimed an assist in a 4\u20130 victory at Plymouth Argyle, earning himself a mention on the Football League team of the week.

Bury enjoyed a positive start to their promotion campaign, though Flitcroft said that \"I don\u2019t know who thinks we\u2019re going to win every game this season. They're deluded, they're unintelligent and it\u2019s not going to happen\". He signed Hallam Hope in November, initially on loan, and dismissed questions over the club spending beyond its means. He was nominated for another Manager of the Month for February as the team went the month unbeaten to close the gap to first-place to six points. Flitcroft led Bury to promotion into League One with a 1\u20130 win over Tranmere Rovers on the final day of the 2014\u201315 season, securing the third automatic promotion place behind Shrewsbury Town and Burton Albion."]}, {"page": "The Kingsway School", "response": ["*Hallam Hope, footballer"]}, {"page": "2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup", "response": ["* Hallam Hope"]}, {"page": "Jacques Maghoma", "response": ["Maghoma started the 2014\u201315 season with an assist for Giles Coke's shot from distance as Wednesday beat Brighton & Hove Albion 1\u20130; Coke's goal was voted Wednesday's Goal of 2014.

In February 2015, he provided the assists for all three Wednesday goals in a win away to Millwall, and he finished the season with 36 appearances, which included 28 league starts.
