A total of five peer-reviewed papers resulted from their collaboration. Kazi also trained further in renal electron microscopy with Professor Peter Furness at Leicester Royal Infirmary to upgrade electron microscopy for renal & transplant pathology in Pakistan at the Sindh Institute of Urology & Transplantation, making Sindh Institute of Urology & Transplantation the first and only center in Pakistan where diagnostic electron microscopy is regularly done on both native renal and renal allograft biopsy material. The Histopathology department at Sindh Institute of Urology & Transplantation, with the facility of renal & transplant pathology, has facilitated the institute to become the largest renal transplant centre in South Asia, conducting the highest number of renal transplants in the region.", "Kazi's research work in renal & transplant pathology includes over 80 published works, mostly in international medical & scientific journals. These include the papers on the use of Bayesian Belief Network for accurate diagnosis of early acute transplant rejection at the University of Leicester with Professor Peter Furness, and the papers that described the true pattern of renal diseases in adults and children for the first time in Pakistan with Professor Adeebul Hasan Rizvi and Professor Muhammed Mubarak."]}, {"page": "Furness, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Furness"]}]}}
