She became the wife of Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy.  Their son was Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy.\nStandard accounts of the Percy family identify Eleanor as the daughter of the \"Earl of Arundel\". Arrangements for Eleanor's marriage to Lord Percy are found in the recognizance made in 1300 by Eleanor's father, Richard, Earl of Arundel, for a debt of 2,000 marks which he owed Sir Henry Percy. Eleanor was styled as a \"kinswoman\" of Edward II on two occasions; once in 1318 and again in 1322 presumably by her descent from Amadeus IV, Count of Savoy who was the brother of Edward II's great-grandmother, Beatrice of Savoy. Eleanor's brothers, Edmund and John were also styled as \"kinsmen\" of the king. Eleanor's identity is further indicated by the presence of the old and new arms of FitzAlan (or Arundel) at her tomb.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Fitzalan, 1st Earl of Arundel", "response": ["#Eleanor FitzAlan, married Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy."]}, {"page": "Eleanor Fitzalan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eleanor FitzAlan "]}, {"page": "Henry Percy, 1st Baron Percy", "response": ["Henry de Percy married Eleanor FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel,Gee, Loveday Lewes, Women, art, and patronage from Henry III to Edward III: 1216\u20131377, (The Boydell Press, 2002), 147. and had two sons:"]}, {"page": "FitzAlan", "response": ["* Eleanor FitzAlan (ca. 1284 \u2013 ca. 1328)"]}, {"page": "Alice of Saluzzo, Countess of Arundel", "response": ["* Eleanor FitzAlan, married Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy, by whom she had issue."]}]}}
