Sometimes referred to as 'John' or 'J.B.' Wostinholm, he was also secretary of the Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1864 until 1902.\nWostinholm was a charted accountant, stockbroker and estate agent who worked out of offices on Bramall Lane in Sheffield.  He took the position of secretary of the Bramall Lane Cricket Ground in 1862 and was responsible for the ground's development into a top class cricket venue.  He also became secretary of the recently formed Yorkshire County Cricket Club and worked to establish Yorkshire as the leading county.In 1889 he was instrumental in the formation of a new football team to play at the Bramall Lane ground during the winter months and became the club secretary of Sheffield United at their inception.  Although the team was selected by a committee and coached by a trainer, Wostinholm undertook many of the duties currently associated with that of a football manager including player transfers and dealing with The Football Association.\nRetiring from Bramall Lane in 1899 and Yorkshire in 1902 Wostinholm died in 1909 at the age of 73.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheffield United F.C.", "response": ["At its formation in 1889 United did not employ what would today be termed a manager, the side was coached by a trainer and a football committee selected the team and decided upon tactics (this was a continuation of the structure of Sheffield United Cricket Club from which the football team had been formed.) They did appoint Joseph Wostinholm to the position of club secretary and he was responsible for the day-to-day running of the club, matchday organisation and dealing with players and contracts. Wostinholm oversaw a period of rapid growth for the team, culminating in 1899 when United won their one and only First Division championship, after which he retired. Wostinholm was replaced by John Nicholson as secretary and he would remain in post for over 30 years until his death in 1932. Nicholson presided over the most successful period in the club's history as United became a leading force in English football, winning the FA Cup four times and regularly challenged at the top of the league but a second Division One title for the club eluded him."]}]}}
