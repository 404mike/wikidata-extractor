Moffat was the grandson of actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree.\nAfter studying at the London School of Economics, Moffat became a socialite and began to make films to promote the war effort.  During World War II he filmed activities of the US Army, meeting director George Stevens, whom he soon followed to Hollywood and assisted at Paramount Pictures.  In the 1950s, between his two marriages, Moffat had a string of love affairs, notably with Elizabeth Taylor and Lady Caroline Blackwood.
