British officials have been reported to be seeking legal advice on whether they can reclaim the \u20ac1.4 billion invested by the United Kingdom, of the \u20ac10 billion spent to date.

In August 2018, it was reported the UK will look to create a competing satellite navigation system to Galileo post-Brexit.
