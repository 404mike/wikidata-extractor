Several economists have been critical of the Review, for example, a paper by Byatt et al. (2006) describes the Review as \"deeply flawed\". Some economists (such as Brad DeLong and John Quiggin) have supported the Review. Others have criticised aspects of Review's analysis, but argued that some of its conclusions might still be justified based on other grounds, e.g., see papers by Martin Weitzman (2007) and Dieter Helm (2008).", "Dieter Helm (2008) of Oxford University was critical of the Review's analysis but accepted its conclusion of the urgent need to reduce emissions. Helm justified this on the grounds that future damages to the environment would probably not be fully compensated for by increases in man-made capital. The draft report of the Garnaut Climate Change Review, a similar study conducted in Australia in 2008 by Ross Garnaut broadly endorsed the approach undertaken by Stern, but concluded, in the light of new information, that Stern had underestimated the severity of the problem and the extent of the cuts in emissions that were required to avoid dangerous climate change.", "Economists have different views over the cost estimates of climate change mitigation given in the Review. Paul Ekins of King's College London (Treasury Committee, 2008) has said that Stern's central mitigation cost estimate is \"reasonable,\" but economists Robert Mendelsohn and Dieter Helm have commented that the estimate is probably too low. According to Mendelsohn, the Stern Review is far too optimistic about mitigation costs, stating that \"[one] of the depressing things about the greenhouse gas problem is that the cost of eliminating it is quite high. We will actually have to sacrifice a great deal to cut emissions dramatically\" (Mendelsohn, 2007)."]}, {"page": "Wind power in Scotland", "response": ["*Dieter Helm"]}, {"page": "2007 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor Dieter Helm.

Presentations were made by Anneli Palo and Asko L\u00f5hmus, scientists from the University of Tartu; Tarmo T\u00fc\u00fcr, the Chairman of the Estonian Fund for Nature; EFA coordinator Linda-Mari V\u00e4li; Marika Mann, the founder, owner and CEO of the nature tourism enterprise Estonian Nature Tours (:et); and Hasso Krull, a cultural theoretician. Anneli Palo's presentation covered the historical development of Estonian forests, drawing attention to the fact that the proportion of real virgin forest constitutes just 2% of total forest area in the country. The Chairman of the Estonian Fund for Nature pointed out as well the small extent of old forests, cast doubt on the protection of sites deemed eligible for conservation, and presented a proposal to amend the Nature Conservation Act being prepared by the Estonian Fund for Nature so as to provide a minimum system of protection that could not be negatively affected by amending (with regulations) the legal definitions of cutting. Linda-Mari V\u00e4li, the coordinator of the General Programme of the EFA, presented its initial version of the next forestry development plan, calling it a \"compensatory development plan\" that would counterbalance the social and ecological damage done by the current, intensive development plan. During the second part of the conference, Marika Mann showcased the unused potential of nature tourism in Estonia and the country's unique position as a birdwatching destination, emphasising (with the rest of the world as an example) the need for state support in developing nature tourism. Hasso Krull presented the concept of natural capital of the British economist Dieter Helm. This concept attributes the highest value to renewable natural resources: clean air and water and natural biotic communities. Examples Krull highlighted included comparison of the price of locally produced drinking water to that of imported drinking water, the price of conserving bogs to restoring them and the price of clear-cut forest to the price of standing timber. In the last presentation of the day, Asko L\u00f5hmus revealed the results of a study where a working group of conservation biologists placed official forest statistics under scrutiny, using a thousand random sites for research. The results confirmed the scientists\u2019 long-held suspicions that the forest statistics presented by the government are inaccurate and give a more positive depiction of the situation than exists in reality. The research is planned to continue and its raw data to be published."]}]}}
