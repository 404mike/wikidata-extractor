He is currently working in the independent circuit in the United Kingdom for several promotions.  Simmons' most high-profile work in the UK came in the Frontier Wrestling Alliance under the face gimmick of Simmons the Butler. Simmons later returned to the FWA under the ring name Andy Boy Simmons but remained face. He is the current CWL Heavyweight Champion in the Championship Wrestling League.\nThe Boy in Simmons' ring name comes from his idol Davey Boy Smith, best known as WWF's British Bulldog. Simmons has taken on many elements of the Bulldog character including the ring gear and the finishing move. He now teaches classes in Portsmouth at the revolution pro wrestling school on Saturdays, Sundays and Wednesdays.\nHe was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis in his childhood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy Simmons", "response": ["#Redirect Andrew Simmons"]}, {"page": "Liss, Hampshire", "response": ["*Andrew Simmons (born 1984), professional wrestler"]}, {"page": "Andy Simmonz", "response": ["#Redirect Andrew Simmons"]}, {"page": "Andy Boy Simmonz", "response": ["#Redirect Andrew Simmons"]}, {"page": "Simmons (surname)", "response": ["* Andrew Simmons (born 1984), British wrestler"]}, {"page": "Andrew Simmons (disambiguation)", "response": ["Andrew Simmons is a wrestler.", "Andrew Simmons may also refer to:", "*Andrew Simmons (environmentalist)", "*Andrew Simmons (journalist)", "*Andrew Simmons, character in Ann Carver's Profession"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Andrew Simmons, wrestler, was born in Liss"]}, {"page": "Simmons, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Simmons"]}]}}
