The Ray Peacock Podcast was successful, spawning live shows (attended by special guests such as Harry HillThe Ray Peacock Podcast - Episode 33 and The Office actor Ewen MacIntoshThe Ray Peacock Podcast - Episode 32), but ended after four series, as the presenters felt they were spending too much time making fun of Raji.", "The first episode of the Peacock and Gamble Podcast was released in the spring of 2009, a brand new show following in the wake of The Ray Peacock Podcast. No longer presented by Raji James, the show was slightly more freeform than the previous podcast, with fewer recurring features - the humour being more autobiographical and anecdotal than its predecessor. The podcast was released weekly on Tuesdays, through Chortle.co.uk. The Peacock and Gamble Podcast featured more fan interaction than the Ray Peacock Podcast before it, with many features - such as \"Fan of the Week\" - being based around the show's official Facebook group, or since the website went live the Peacock and Gamble Forum."]}]}}
