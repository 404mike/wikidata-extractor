Work at the stadium took place, as ground outside the stadium was prepared for car parking. The eclectic training schedule of the previous season was expanded, with bowls and cricket supplemented by games of tennis and baseball. Also on 20 August, a Football League Jubilee Fund match was played against nearby Crewe Alexandra, with the Vale picking up a 3\u20132 win, raising \u00a3243 in the process.", "On the financial side, gate receipts had increased by \u00a3659, however an overall loss was made of \u00a31,723. The move to the southern division had cost a considerable amount in transfer fees, though home game income had improved by \u00a3676 to \u00a36,403. Further financial worries were lessened by a transfer credit of \u00a31,455. Despite the poor season, seventeen players were kept on, though promising teenage midfielder John Smith was sold to Chelsea.
