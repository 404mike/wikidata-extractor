He turned his attention to gastrin while he was Holt Professor of Physiology, and Head of Department, at the University of Liverpool (appointed in 1948). He \"made fundamental contributions to the study of gut hormones through his isolation of the gastric acid stimulating hormone gastrin, the characterisation of its spectrum of actions, the identification of structure-activity relationships and discovery that gastrin was produced in excess in the tumours of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome\". Much of the work on gastrin at Liverpool was with his long-term collaborator Hilda Tracy in the same department.

Gregory and Hilda Tracy were involved in the seminal discovery and synthesis of the peptide hormone gastrin at the University of Liverpool. Gastrin is involved in secretion of gastric acid (HCl) in the stomach."]}]}}
