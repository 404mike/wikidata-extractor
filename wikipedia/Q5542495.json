The Chiefs of Staff believed that\u2014contrary to Tizard's view\u2014once the Soviet Union became able to attack the United States itself with nuclear weapons in the late 1950s, America might not risk its own cities to defend Europe, or not emphasise targets that endangered the United Kingdom more than the United States. Britain thus needed the ability to convince the USSR that attacking Europe would be too costly regardless of American participation. Part of the perceived effectiveness of an independent deterrent was the willingness to target enemy cities. Slessor saw atomic weapons as a way to avoid a third devastating world war given that the two previous ones had begun without them.  When Air Marshal Sir George Mills became head of RAF Bomber Command in 1955 he similarly insisted on targeting Soviet cities."]}, {"page": "George Holroyd Mills", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Mills (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "George Mills", "response": ["George Mills may refer to:", "*George Mills (footballer) (1908\u20131970), English footballer", "*George Mills (RAF officer) (1902\u20131971), British Air Chief Marshal", "*George Mills (novel), a 1982 novel by American author Stanley Elkin", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1793) (1793\u20131865), English cricketer", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1867) (1867\u20131942), New Zealand cricketer", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1916) (1916\u20131979), New Zealand cricketer", "*George Mills (cricketer, born 1923) (1923\u20131983), English cricketer", "*George Mills (politician) (1876\u20131948), Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, 1920\u20131926", "*George Mills (writer) (1896\u20131972), children's author and schoolmaster", "*George Mills (artist) (1792\u20131824), British sculptor, engraver and medallist", "*George Mills (shipbuilder) (1808\u20131881), Scottish shipbuilder, journalist and novelist", "*George Mills (athlete) (born 1999), British champion athlete"]}, {"page": "George Mills (Black Rod)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Mills (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "Strategic Air Command in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The RAF started to acquire its own nuclear weapons, and these were supplemented with US nuclear weapons acquired under Project E.

Mills argued that in view of the devastation that thermonuclear weapons could cause in the UK, that this was insufficient, and that policy needed to switch to one of deterrence. Instead of targeting airfields, the RAF should target the civilian population.
