He was formerly chairman of the Young BNP, the youth division of the British National Party (BNP), and was director of publicity for the party before his BNP membership was suspended in early April 2010.\nCollett first drew media attention after his appearance in a 2002 British TV documentary, where, in his role as a representative of the BNP, he made statements celebrating the death of Africans and homosexuals from HIV-AIDS, specifically referring to them as \"AIDS monkeys\". After the documentary was aired on Channel 4, resulting in negative publicity for the BNP, Collett was temporarily expelled from the party. He later rejoined the BNP, until his membership was suspended in 2010, following an internal conflict with party leadership. \nSince 2010, Collett has concentrated on his online political commentary, in which he promotes white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and conspiracy theories about Jews. In September 2019, Collett founded a white nationalist group called Patriotic Alternative.\nIn November 2020 he was suspended from Twitter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve King", "response": ["In June 2018, he retweeted a comment by Mark Collett, a British neo-Nazi and self-described admirer of Hitler, about Europe \"waking up\" to mass immigration."]}]}}
