The periodical found the film to be confusing and disappointing. Similarly, solar physicist Anjana Ahuja, a columnist for The Times, commented on the lack of source of artificial gravity on board the spacecraft, saying \"Danny Boyle could have achieved the same level of scientific fidelity in Sunshine by giving a calculator to a schoolboy\".

The Economist also featured a favourable review, praising Dawkins's writing style as \"persuasive\" and lauding its educational value. Mark Fisher in The List called Dawkins a \"compelling communicator\", adding that the book was \"illuminating\" and praising the use of humorous anecdotes throughout.
