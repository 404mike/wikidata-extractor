The visitors took the lead early in the first half when the ball was adjudged over the line before Charsley cleared, and Wheldon equalised shortly before the interval. Constant pressing in the second half was repulsed by the Newton Heath defence, and Wheldon failed to convert with only the goalkeeper to beat, then, two minutes from time, Wheldon was successful from a similar position and Small Heath won 2\u20131.The Alliance.

Their defence was much weakened by the inclusion of Fred Heath in place of Caesar Jenkyns, and Birmingham St George's won the postponed match quite easily.Football. St. George's v. Small Heath. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 17 March 1891. At home to Bootle, Ward came in for Charsley in goal, and Albert Evers, making his league debut, and Charsley's brother Walter came in to the half-back line instead of Heath and the still-absent Jenkyns.Alliance Matches. Small Heath v. Bootle. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 23 March 1891. The scores were level at one apiece until nearing half-time, when Charlie Short scored three goals in as many minutes; another three in the second half, for Devey, Hands and Wheldon, secured a 7\u20131 win and lifted Small Heath to ninth place in the table.The Alliance.
