This was the first time that Leno used his stepfather's stage name, \"Leno\", which he never registered legally. The same year, Leno also appeared in his first pantomime, in Liverpool, where he had a supporting part as a juvenile clown in Fortunatus; or, The Magic Wishing Cap alongside his parents, who appeared as \"Mr and Mrs Leno \u2013 Comic Duettists\".Anthony, p. 16 On 18 July 1866, Leno, Henry and their parents appeared on the opening night of the Cambridge Music Hall in Toxteth, Liverpool, under the billing \"Mr. and Mrs. Leno, the Great, Sensational, Dramatic and Comic Duettists and The Brothers Leno, Lancashire Clog, Boot and Pump Dancers\".Anthony, p. 17 The following year, the brothers made their first appearance without their parents at the Britannia music hall in Hoxton. Although initially successful, the pair experienced many bouts of unemployment and often busked outside London pubs to make a living.Brandreth, p. 3 Tired of surviving on little or no money, Henry left the clog dancing act to take up a trade in London, forcing Leno to consider a future as a solo performer. Henry later founded a dance school. Henry was replaced intermittently in the act by the boys' uncle, Johnny Danvers, who was a week older than Leno. Leno and Danvers had been close from an early age.", "In 1870, the Lenos appeared in another pantomime by Leno's father, Jack the Giant Killer; or, Harlequin Grim Gosling, or the Good Fairy Queen of the Golden Pine Grove, in which Leno played the title character and featured in the variety entertainment that preceded the pantomime.Anthony, p. 22 Throughout the 1870s, Leno and his parents performed as \"The Comic Trio (Mr. & Mrs. Leno and Dan Patrick) In Their Really Funny Entertainments, Songs and Dances\". In the family act with his parents and Johnny Danvers, young Leno often took the leading role in such sketches as his stepfather's The Wicklow Wedding. Another of their sketches was Torpedo Bill, in which Leno played the title role, an inventor of explosive devices. His parents played a \"washerwoman\" and a \"comic cobbler\". This was followed by another sketch, Pongo the Monkey.Wood, pp. 83\u201384 Opening at Pullan's Theatre of Varieties in Bradford on 20 May 1878, this burlesque featured Leno as an escaped monkey; it became his favourite sketch of the period.", "In 1896, the impresario Milton Bode approached Leno with a proposal for a farcical musical comedy vehicle devised for him called Orlando Dando, the Volunteer, by Basil Hood with music by Walter Slaughter. Leno's agent declined the offer, as his client was solidly booked for two years. Bode offered Leno \u00a3625 (\u00a3 in  adjusted for inflation) for a six-week appearance in 1898. Upon hearing this, the comedian overrode his agent and accepted the offer.Brandreth, p. 69 Leno toured the provinces in the piece and was an immediate success. So popular was his performance that Bode re-engaged him for a further two shows: the musical farce In Gay Piccadilly! (1899), by George R. Sims, in which Leno's uncle, Johnny Danvers appeared (The Era said that Leno was \"attracting huge houses\" and called him \"excruciatingly funny\");\"Amusements in Birmingham: Grand Theatre\", The Era, 11 November 1899, p. 23a and the musical comedy Mr. Wix of Wickham (1902). Both toured after their original runs.\"Dan Leno at The Theatre Royal\", Sheffield Independent, 31 October 1899, p. 11Booth (1996), p. 203; the latter musical was revived on Broadway in 1904 with many of the songs composed or re-set with new music by the young Jerome Kern. In 1897, Leno went to America and made his debut on 12 April of that year at Hammerstein's Olympia Music Hall on Broadway, where he was billed as \"The Funniest Man on Earth\". Reviews were mixed: one newspaper reported that the house roared its approval, while another complained that Leno's English humour was out of date.Brandreth, p. 64 His American engagement came to an end a month later, and Leno said that it was \"the crown of my career\".Brandreth, p. 66 Despite his jubilation, Leno was conscious of the few negative reviews he had received and rejected all later offers to tour the United States and Australia."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Johnny Danvers, actor and comedian"]}, {"page": "Old Bill (comics)", "response": ["In 1917, a successful musical based on the character, The Better 'Ole, opened in London at the Oxford Music Hall, where it ran for over 800 performances, starring Arthur Bourchier as Old Bill.\"Bourchier, Arthur\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920\u20132007, online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 28 Oct 2008  It later also ran successfully on Broadway, where Charles Coburn starred as Old Bill.
