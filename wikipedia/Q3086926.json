As part of the 1894 Home Nations Championship and this time led by Frank Hill, Sweet-Escott found himself again on the losing side when Ireland won by a single penalty goal. Sweet-Escott's last game for Wales was another match against Ireland, in the following year's tournament. In this, his final international, Sweet-Escott finished on the winning side."]}, {"page": "Selwyn Biggs", "response": ["Biggs followed his brother Norman when he joined Cardiff Rugby Club, the team he would represent throughout his international career. He joined Cardiff during the 1889/90 season and the next year he was made captain of the club's reserve team.Davies (1975) pp.211-213 In 1894 he was selected to play for the invitational touring side Barbarian F.C., facing Rockcliff on 2 April. He was first selected to represent Wales in the opening game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship, the very next international after his brother represented Wales for the final time. Biggs was partnered in the half-back role with Llanelli's Ben Davies, himself a new cap; and the first of six partners he would be paired with over his nine match career. His first international was against England in a game played at St. Helens in Swansea. Under the captaincy of Wales rugby superstar Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales lost 3\u20137, with the English forwards outplaying their Welsh counterparts in the loose.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:7. The selectors kept faith with Biggs for the next game of the Championship, away to Scotland, but switched Davies for the more experienced Fred Parfitt. Wales lost this game too, again the forwards could not contend with the opposing side and Biggs and Parfitt were replaced by Morgan of Llanelli and Sweet-Escott of Cardiff in the final game of the tournament."]}, {"page": "Percy Phillips (rugby union)", "response": ["Nicknamed 'Sparrow', due to his very light frame, Phillips was a fly-half noted for his excellent attacking play, but was weak defensively and was a poor kicker.Smith (1980), pg 81. Phillips is also recognised as one of the first specialised rugby players in Welsh rugby. Under the captaincy of Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Newport utilised team-mate Fred Parfitt's expert passing to secure the scrum-half berth which linked up with Phillips as a specialised runner.Richards, Alun; A Touch of Glory, 100 Years of Welsh Rugby; Michael Joseph (London), pg 131.  Phillips was also used as a running partner with Gould, for Newport and later Wales, breaking shoulder to shoulder with his captain, and using fast inter-passing to confuse defenders."]}, {"page": "Daniel Jones (rugby union)", "response": ["Evans first played club rugby for his hometown club of Taibach,Dan Jones player profile Ospreysrugby.com before switching to Aberavon. Although Aberavon was an improving club it was still not a fashionable club to play for and had yet to provide an international player. In 1897 as part of the Home Nations Championship Jones made history for the club by being chosen to represent Wales. The Welsh team had been experiencing several years of unstable partnerships at half-back, and the opening match of the 1897 Championship was no exception, with Jones brought in with veteran player Selwyn Biggs as replacements for Llewellyn Lloyd and Fred Parfitt. The previous season's encounter with England had ended in a humiliating loss for Wales, but with a much changed team, the Welsh were far more competitive in the 1897 game. Wales beat England 11-0, with Jones scoring one of three Welsh tries, the other two coming from Arthur Boucher and Tom Pearson. Jones may have been selected for further games that season, but due to the Gould Affair, Wales left the International Rugby Board and could not play in any further international games. By the time Wales were reinstated, Jones' place had been taken by Cardiff's Jack Elliott, and Jones did not represent his country again."]}, {"page": "Ben Davies (rugby union)", "response": ["Davies played club rugby for first class Welsh team, Llanelli, and it was while representing the 'Scarlets' that he was first selected to play for Wales. Wales had used the Newport half-back pairing of Percy Phillips and Fred Parfitt, but after the retirement of Phillips, the selectors began experimenting with new pairings. The opening game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship against England saw the introduction of two new caps into the half-back positions, Davies and Cardiff's Selwyn Biggs. Despite experienced and talented backs, including Billy Bancroft, Tom Pearson and captain Arthur Gould, the weak forward play from Wales left the backs hamstrung, and the team lost 6-14.Griffiths (1987), 4:7. The next game of the Championship saw the selectors retain Biggs, but Davies was replaced by a returning Fred Parfitt."]}]}}
