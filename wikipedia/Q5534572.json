He was 32 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his part in the Second Ostend Raid.\nOn 9/10 May 1918 at Ostend, Belgium, Lieutenant Drummond commanding HMML (Motor Launch) 254, volunteered for rescue work and was following HMS Vindictive to the harbour when a shell burst on board killing an officer and a deck hand and badly wounding the coxswain and Lieutenant Drummond. Notwithstanding his wounds, this officer brought M.L. 254 alongside Vindictive and then took off two officers and 38 men, some of whom were killed or wounded while embarking. He retained consciousness long enough to back his vessel away from the piers and towards the open sea before collapsing exhausted from his wounds.Drummond married Maude Aylmer Tindal Bosanquet (d 27 Sept, 1967) on 2 July 1918.\nDespite suffering from his severe wounds received in his VC action, Drummond served with the Royal Naval Patrol Service in World War II.\nHe died on 21 April 1941 from a fall.His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 19th century", "response": ["* Geoffrey Drummond (1886\u20131941)"]}, {"page": "Victor Crutchley", "response": ["Crutchley transferred to the damaged motor launch ML 254.

As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the deck of a motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch\u2014like the cruiser\u2014was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.Snelling, p. 255"]}, {"page": "James Beard Foundation Award: 1990s", "response": ["* Best Culinary Video: Julia Child and Jacques Pepin, Cooking in Concert; hosts: Julia Child and Jacques Pepin, producer: Geoffrey Drummond", "* Best National Television Cooking Show: In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs; host; Julia Child, producer: Geoffrey Drummond, WMVS/Milwaukee Public Television", "* Best National Television Cooking Show: Baking with Julia; host; Julia Child, producers: Geoffrey Drummond and Nat Katzman, PBS"]}, {"page": "James Beard Foundation Award: 2000s", "response": ["* Best National Television Cooking Show: Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home; hosts; Julia Child and Jacques Pepin, producers: Geoffrey Drummond and Nat Katzman, PBS"]}]}}
