Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman have kind of fixed everything so the kids have nothing to do\", instead resorting to battle reenactments, \"these kids, they dress up but they've never fought anything.\" Morrison had originally conceptualized a \"Super-Sons\" story as part of his All-Star Superman series, where Superman and Batman had stopped all crime, noting that \"[o]ne day, I might get to them or some version of it. There's a little bit of that in the \"Multiversity\" series that I'm doing\". Morrison originally designated this universe as Earth-11. The one-shot was published in October 2014. "]}]}}
