However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not be heard over the electric instruments. However, Arden would manage Wizzard, despite Wood's negative comments towards Arden. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively.", "For the band's fourth album, Eldorado, a concept album about a daydreamer, Lynne stopped multi-tracking strings and hired Louis Clark as string arranger with an orchestra and choir.Eaton Music \u2013 Louis Clark.

Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished to spend more time with his family, and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne."]}, {"page": "Mary Hopkin", "response": ["Hopkin's first project in the 1980s was a well-reviewed stint playing the Virgin Mary in Rock Nativity at the Hexagon Theatre in Reading, Berkshire. After this, Mike Hurst (record producer and formerly of the Springfields) asked her to sing lead in a new group named Sundance that he had formed with Mike de Albuquerque of ELO. Their only single, \"What's Love\", allowed them to tour the UK with Dr. Hook but Hopkin quickly left the group, dissatisfied with the gigs. \"What's Love\" proved very popular in South Africa, albeit the only territory where it charted, peaking at no.10 in April 1982.

Bass player Kelly Groucutt and classically-trained cellist Melvyn Gale both joined the band as their replacements. Following the conclusion of the Eldorado's European leg of the tour, the band began recording the new album at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany. ELO had frequently opened for Deep Purple for the initial North American leg of the Eldorado Tour, and Deep Purple had recommended Musicland to ELO. This was the first time ELO recorded at Musicland and the band would later return to record most of the future albums here due to frontman Jeff Lynne's great fondness for it and his working relationship with sound engineer Mack."]}, {"page": "On the Third Day", "response": ["*Mike de Albuquerque \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "ELO 2", "response": ["The album was originally to be titled The Lost Planet, but that concept was quietly dropped.
