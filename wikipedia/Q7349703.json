There are also personal names in use on Latin inscriptions from the Sabine country, but these are given in Latin form. Robert Seymour Conway, in his Italic Dialects, gives approximately 100 words which vary from being well-attested as Sabine to being possibly of Sabine origin. In addition to these he cites place names derived from the Sabine, sometimes giving attempts at reconstructions of the Sabine form. Based on all the evidence, the Linguist List tentatively classifies Sabine as a member of the Umbrian group of Italic languages of the Indo-European family."]}, {"page": "Robert Conway", "response": ["*Robert Seymour Conway (1864\u20131933), British classical scholar and comparative philologist"]}, {"page": "Hibbert Lectures", "response": ["*1932 Robert Seymour Conway Ancient Italy and Modern Religion"]}, {"page": "R.
