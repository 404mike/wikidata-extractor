He is best known for his indie professional wrestling games, such as Wrestling Revolution for iOS and Android devices, which received over 100,000 downloads two months after its launch in 2012. The game later went on to surpass 10 million downloads and its sequel, Wrestling Revolution 3D, went on to compete with WWE 2K games on the mobile and PC market.Dickie began his game development career in 2000 with his first PC game, going on to retire in 2009 to become an educator. He came out of retirement in late 2011 and transitioned to mobile game development, which led to the release of Wrestling Revolution in 2012. However, he once again retired from full-time game development in 2018. In 2019, Dickie confirmed that a new wrestling project was in development for the Nintendo Switch and mobile devices. This project later emerged as Wrestling Empire, which was released in early 2021.\nMany of Dickie's games are infamous for their awkward controls and poor graphics. He has mentioned that the low resolution and low poly graphics in his games have allowed for better performance, in turn enabling him \"to push a lot of boundaries\". The indie and low budget nature of Dickie's games have often contributed to their popularity, leading to Dickie describing himself as being \"single-handedly responsible for the worst games to ever be enjoyed by millions of people.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Talksport", "response": ["* TalkSPORT Clash Of The Titans is  a game created by Mat Dickie (MDickie), It's not available on his download page anymore but can still be downloaded on web.archive.org"]}, {"page": "Mat (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Mat Dickie (born 1980/1981), English indie video game designer and developer"]}, {"page": "Hard Time", "response": ["*Hard Time, a 2007 video game created by Mat Dickie"]}, {"page": "Dickie (name)", "response": ["* Mat Dickie (born 1981), English indie video game developer"]}, {"page": "Super City", "response": ["* Super City, a 2016 video game by Mat Dickie"]}, {"page": "MDickie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mat Dickie"]}, {"page": "Mat dickie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mat Dickie "]}]}}
