Called the \"Plinthios Brokhos\", the resulting figure has been identified by multiple sources as the figure known to Aboriginal Australians as \"The Sun Clouded Over\".

In the early 1980s, the mission set out to investigate the earliest periods in the prehistory of Pakistan, which at that point were only poorly understood, based on the work of Helmut de Terra and T. T. Paterson in the 1930s. One of the localities described by de Terra and Paterson was a place near the village of Rawat where artefact-bearing Pleistocene quartzite deposits could be found eroding out of the ridges and slopes of the Soan Valley. Revisiting the site, which they called Riwat Site 55, in 1983, the mission discovered prehistoric stone tools in good condition, and therefore decided to open an excavation, which was conducted over two seasons by Dennell and Pakistani archaeologist M. Halim. The site was dated to the Upper Palaeolithic, about 45,000 years ago."]}, {"page": "Thomas Paterson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*T. T.
