His play A Picture of Autumn was revived off-Broadway by the Mint Theater Company in 2013. Hunter's play A Day by the Sea was revived off-Broadway by the Mint Theater Company in 2016.

And this astonishing infant is only 18 years old!\" (25 January 1962). The fact that the critic Levin was actively courting Redgrave's elder sister Vanessa may have been significant.
