Despite being British, Forrester was well integrated into the Portuguese community and even received the title \"Baron\" for his work in defending the Portuguese wine growers and creating the first extensive maps of the Douro river and its wine region. In his 1844 pamphlet \"A Word or Two about Port Wine\" he criticized the Douro Wine Company for its control over the Port wine industry and its encouragement of producers to add substantial amounts of brandy to the wine. In Forrester's view, the best wines of the Douro were \"natural\"-meaning without fortification or, if used, in very small amounts. With its monopolistic control over the brandy used in fortification, it was in the Douro Wine Company's interest to encourage extensive fortification."]}, {"page": "Joseph Forrester", "response": ["* Joseph James Forrester (1809\u20131861), English merchant and wine shipper"]}, {"page": "Bar\u00e3o de Forrester", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph James Forrester"]}, {"page": "Jeropiga", "response": ["Historically, jeropiga has been added to Port wine to increase its sweetness, in a practise that is still applied today to some fortified wines. The historic use of jeropiga mixed with brandy and elderberries as a means of coloring in red wines has also been recorded. Nineteenth-century English writers largely dismissed jeropiga when discussing the port wine trade, with W. H. Bidwell calling it an \"adulteration used to bringing up the character of ports\". In 1844, the English wine merchant Joseph James Forrester anonymously published A Word or Two on Port Wine, a pamphlet that, among other criticisms made to the wine trade in the Douro region, denounced the use of jeropiga in wine."]}, {"page": "Frederick William Flower", "response": ["It is not known exactly when Flower took up photography or from where he obtained the necessary expertise. He was one of the first people in Portugal to use the salted paper and calotype processes developed by Henry Fox Talbot in England from the late 1830s. He may have learned of the calotype process from Joseph James Forrester, famous for mapping the Douro river, who took up amateur photography around 1853, although information was first made available in the Revista Liter\u00e1ria published in Porto. Flower made most of his calotypes between 1853 and 1858. He was also the Portuguese pioneer of the use of strip photography. Flower is likely to have obtained his photographic supplies from British suppliers and received instructions along with those supplies."]}, {"page": "Diogo Kopke", "response": ["Kopke worked as a lecturer in mathematics at the Academica Politecnica do Porto. His particular interests were trigonometry, geodesy and theoretical and practical navigation, together with the use of astronomical instruments. He also taught at the Royal Academy of Navy and Commerce of Porto. It is likely that he was the source of Joseph James Forrester\u2019s knowledge on trigonometry. He accompanied Forrester on trips up the Douro river that led to the preparation of two well-received topographical maps of the region and he reviewed Forrester\u2019s work."]}, {"page": "Hugh Owen (photographer)", "response": ["Owen exhibited at the Royal Society of Arts in 1852 and a review in The Times listed him among the best photographers of the day. He rarely went too far from his Bristol home although he is known to have visited Portugal in 1853 or 1854, when he met the amateur photographer, Joseph James Forrester, and is likely to have also met another Porto-based photographer, Frederick William Flower. Although he gave up photography relatively early, he remained active in historical preservation, authoring the well-received Two Centuries of Ceramic Art in Bristol. He left his collection of ceramics to the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. He became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. "]}]}}
