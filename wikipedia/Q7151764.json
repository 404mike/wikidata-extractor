He scored 48 goals in 264 league appearances in a 13-year career in the Football League.\nHe began his career at Aston Villa in 1982, before moving on to Middlesbrough in January 1987. He helped the club to win promotion into the First Division with successive promotions in 1986\u201387 and 1988. He also played in the Full Members Cup final in 1990, before he moved on to Millwall in March 1991. He was sold on to Port Vale in July 1992 for a fee of \u00a3140,000, and helped the \"Valiants\" to win the Football League Trophy in 1993 and then to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1993\u201394.

He went on to provid the cross for Martin Foyle to score the winning goal past Stockport County in the play-off semi-finals. Stockport County were also Vale's opponents in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley on 22 May, and Slaven managed to set up Paul Kerr for Vale's first goal before scoring the second decisive goal of a 2\u20131 victory. Ironically it was Sky TV's match summariser, Lennie Lawrence, who was tasked with naming Slaven as the man of the match just two months after letting him go on a free transfer.
