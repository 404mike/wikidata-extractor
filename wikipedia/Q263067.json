Hall intended to summarize in her own words Voltaire's attitude towards Claude Adrien Helv\u00e9tius and his controversial book De l'esprit, but her first-person expression was mistaken for an actual quotation from Voltaire. Her interpretation does capture the spirit of Voltaire's attitude towards Helvetius; it had been said Hall's summary was inspired by a quotation found in a 1770 Voltaire letter to an Abbot le Riche, in which he was reported to have said, \"I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write.\" Nevertheless, scholars believe there must have again been misinterpretation, as the letter does not seem to contain any such quote.", "Voltaire described Muhammad as an \"impostor\", a \"false prophet\", a \"fanatic\" and a \"hypocrite\".Voltaire, Le Fanatisme ou Mahomet le proph\u00e8te (1741), \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes.

Noam Chomsky stated, \"If you believe in freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Dictators such as Stalin and Hitler, were in favor of freedom of speech for views they liked only. If you're in favor of freedom of speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.\" Lee Bollinger argues that \"the free speech principle involves a special act of carving out one area of social interaction for extraordinary self-restraint, the purpose of which is to develop and demonstrate a social capacity to control feelings evoked by a host of social encounters.\" Bollinger argues that tolerance is a desirable value, if not essential. However, critics argue that society should be concerned by those who directly deny or advocate, for example, genocide (see limitations above)."]}]}}
