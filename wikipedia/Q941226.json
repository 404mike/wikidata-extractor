Despite being able to select from a group of players which included Lions tourists Jason White, Tom Smith, Scott Murray, Gregor Townsend, Gordon Bulloch, Nathan Hines, Chris Cusiter, Mike Blair, Ross Ford and Simon Taylor - as well as experienced players like Jon Petrie and Stuart Grimes - Williams' team only won 17.65% of their matches. Scotland won just three games - against the Tier 2 nations Japan and Samoa in 2004, and against Italy in the 2005 Six Nations. Additionally, Williams controversially discarded Townsend - a celebrated figure in Scottish rugby, then aged only 30 - a week prior to the unveiling of his first national squad, despite an admission that his team lacked experienced centres."]}, {"page": "Chris Paterson", "response": ["Paterson announced his retirement from international rugby in December 2011; at the time, he held many of the most significant Scottish career records. His 109 caps was more than 20 clear of then-second-placed Scott Murray; his 96 starts are also the most in Scotland history. He remained Scotland's most-capped player until Ross Ford overtook him in 2017. Paterson was also involved in more defeats (65) than any other Scotland internationalist. Despite not being a regular kicker until after he had amassed 26 caps, he retired as Scotland's all-time leader in points (809), conversions (86) and penalties (140). Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his Scotland career was his versatility; he retired as one of Scotland's three top cap-winners at two different positions. Paterson's 49 caps on the wing were third to Kenny Logan (63) and Sean Lamont (52); his 43 caps as a fullback were also third, this time to Gavin Hastings (61) and Andy Irvine (47). In addition, he has the most caps of any player from the Home Unions (England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales) who did not appear in a Test with the British & Irish Lions.", "His high profile in Scotland has been used in marketing campaigns for several companies.

Sir William Fairbairn (1789\u20131874) was another engineer who built the first iron hulled steamship the Lord Dundas and constructed over 1,000 bridges using the tubular steel method which he pioneered.
