It is possible that the kindergarten was Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain's idea, for in his diary dated 14 August 1901, Chamberlain's assistant secretary Geoffrey Robinson wrote, \"Another long day occupied chiefly in getting together a list of South African candidates for Lord Milner from people already in the (Civil) Service\".Wrench, John Evelyn, \"Alfred Lord Milner\", pgs. 239-240  They were in favour of the South African union and, ultimately, an imperial federation with the British Empire itself. On Milner's retirement, most continued in the service under William Waldegrave Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne (Lord Selborne), who was Milner's successor, and the number two-man at the Colonial Office.  The Kindergarten started off with 12 men, most of whom were Oxford graduates and English civil servants, who made the trip to South Africa in 1901 to help Lord Milner rebuild the war torn economy.  Quite young and inexperienced, one of them brought with him a biography written by F.S. Oliver on Alexander Hamilton.  He read the book, and the plan for rebuilding the new government of South Africa was based along the lines of the book, Hamilton's federalist philosophy, and his knowledge of treasury operations.Amery, Leo, My Political Life, Vol I, pgs. 268-69  The name, \"Milner's Kindergarten\", although first used derisively by Sir William Thackeray Marriott, was adopted by the group as its namesake.Gollin, Alfred, \"Proconsul in Politics\", pg. 41"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir William Thackeray Marriott"]}, {"page": "Brighton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"5\"| Rt Hon.

In that year he was selected by the Liberal Party along with William Thackeray Marriott to contest the two seat parliamentary constituency of Brighton. At the general election in April 1880 the two Liberals topped the poll, unseating the sitting Conservative members of parliament. In 1884 Marriott resigned his seat to be re-elected as a Conservative, and at the general election of 1885 Hollond lost his seat to David Smith of the Conservative Party. Following a split in the Liberals over Irish Home Rule, Hollond became a Liberal Unionist, standing unsuccessfully at East Perthshire. By 1889 he was president of the Marylebone Liberal Unionist Association. He was a Deputy Lieutenant for London and Justice of the Peace for Devon, Somerset and Middlesex.
