Callow contended that for him to agree to play Dickens, the script would have to be a sufficiently high quality. When he heard that the author was to feature in Doctor Who his heart \"sank\" as he felt fiction has a tendency to posit the author as \"a kind of all-purpose Victorian literary character and really understand little, if anything, about him, his life or his books\". Director Euros Lyn noted that the material being of interest to Callow was key to getting him involved. Promoting his role in Doctor Who, Callow stated that writer Mark Gatiss knew \"exactly what Dickens is all about\" and \"very cleverly connects his idealism... with the Doctor's desire to save the world\". Callow was also pleased that the episode portrayed Dickens as he was towards the end of his life: ill and sad rather than energetic.

However, he referred to it as \"enjoyable\" and praised the directing of Euros Lyn. Berriman considered the highlight of the episode to be the subplot of family. IGN's Ahsan Haque rated the episode 6.8 out of 10, finding several logic flaws and calling the story \"marginally interesting\". Digital Spy reviewer Dek Hogan felt \"The Idiot's Lantern\" was a disappointment after Gatiss's previous Doctor Who script \"The Unquiet Dead\", feeling that a similar plot had been done before and it played like a \"pastiche of Doctor Who than the show itself\". He was also not favourable to Lipman's performance as the Wire, saying the character \"[lacked] menace\", and found the subplot of Tommy's father \"annoying\".

Myles states that Gwen becomes a harsher character, but she feels that, \"if she wasn't, people would die\".

Her horrific experiences turn her into \"a biting cynic\"; when both government and army betray the British people, Gwen claims to understand finally why the Doctor does not save humanity from world crises. She believes he \"must look at this planet and turn away in shame\". A press release stated that Miracle Day had Gwen \"make the most terrible decisions, on behalf of all mankind\". This is evident in \"The Blood Line\", where her character is shown to be willing to sacrifice the entire Torchwood team, in addition to her dying father, for the good of the world.

Because Law & Order offered her 13 episodes a year, she went with that over Torchwood which had been reduced to 5. In response, Davies created the character of Lois Habiba, played by Cush Jumbo, to be a \"kind of a Martha figure\", one with added innocence who is out of her depth. Agyeman does not rule out returning to the show at a later date, however. Davies reveals in his non-fiction book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale that Martha was also intended to appear in The Sarah Jane Adventures series two finale Enemy of the Bane in December 2008, but the character had to be replaced with classic series character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) \"at the last minute\" due to Agyeman's role in Law & Order: UK; had Martha appeared, the character would have appeared in all three programmes in the franchise."]}, {"page": "Ianto Jones", "response": ["Comparing Jack's relationship with Ianto to his romantic tension with Gwen, David-Lloyd states \"I think [there are] different sorts of love or lust, as it might be, and I think that's an ongoing thing ...

To him, Ianto views the relationship as \"serious and committed\", as seen in \"A Day in the Death\" where he tells Owen that it is not just about sex. However, from dialogue in \"Something Borrowed\", Walker believes that Jack appears to equate his relationship with Ianto to nothing more than a \"recreational activity\". Walker also notes how important it was for Ianto when he cut in to dance with Jack, as this is the first time that his relationship with Jack is presented before the rest of the crew.Walker, p. 197 The novel The House that Jack Built includes a scene where Gwen tries to clarify whether Ianto understands the nature of his relationship with Jack, saying \"You do know he's ...\", which Ianto finishes \"Just a shag?\" before adding \"Yes I know. I can't help it, though. I've never been much good at casual.\" In radio play \"The Dead Line\", set just prior to series three, Ianto expounds his insecurities to Jack, who refutes them, confirming that his feelings for Ianto are real.
