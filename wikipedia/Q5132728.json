He made his Third Division South debut for Gordon Hodgson's \"Valiants\" in a 2\u20130 defeat to Norwich City at Carrow Road on 19 August 1950. After starting the next two games he lost his position to Cliff Pinchbeck, who had failed to turn up at the start of the season. He played three further games throughout the season, but had to wait until September 1953 for his seventh and final appearance. He was released from his contract at Vale Park by manager Freddie Steele in December 1953.

The initial clash with Vale took place on a heavy Victoria Ground pitch was seen by over 48,000 fans. In an entertaining first half Alan Bennett put Vale into the lead after six minutes and although Stoke pushed hard for an equaliser they couldn't beat Ray King. Then the Vale fans were celebrating again as their side went 2\u20130 up, Cliff Pinchbeck scoring after 45 seconds into the second half. Stoke were rattled and soon after Albert Mullard pulled one back with a crisp shot from the edge of the area and he then scored again to set up a frantic finale. However, with both teams battling it out in the mud the match finished in a fair draw. With Vale Park waterlogged it was back to the Victoria Ground and was again a tense encounter. Vale were the better team creating the most chances but with just seconds remaining Frank Bowyer who had been kept quite by the \"Valiants\" defence suddenly found space and headed in a Harry Oscroft cross to end the tie."]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with a 1\u20130 win over Bristol Rovers, which was followed by a 1\u20130 reverse to Southend United at Roots Hall three days later. This loss was thanks to an own goal from Garth Butler, who put the ball into his own net despite being some distance from any Southend players. A seven match unbeaten run followed, built upon a defence that leaked just five goals, King and Hamlett settling in well. Bad news off the field returned however, when Stoke-on-Trent City Council rejected the club's application to move two stands from The Old Rec to the new stadium. As a result, the club set up a 100,000 Shilling Fund to build the two stands from scratch. On the pitch results began to turn against the \"Valiants\", and so striker Cliff Pinchbeck was signed from Brighton & Hove Albion for a \u00a33,500 fee. Pinchbeck marked his debut with a hat-trick over Millwall, receiving a standing ovation from his new fans. More off-field stadium troubles came when the Regional Officer of the Minister of Works refused a licence for the stadium on unspecified grounds. Club officials were forced to travel to London to discuss the matter with the minister, eventually convincing him to change his mind. The home match with Newport County on 15 October was notable as the first Vale match to offer a matchday programme.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Cliff Pinchbeck", "|1||FW||||Cliff Pinchbeck||14||2||16", "| November 1949 || FW ||  || Cliff Pinchbeck || Brighton & Hove Albion || \u00a33,500 || "]}, {"page": "1950\u201351 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["They finished twelfth with 45 points, a whole 25 points short of promotion.
