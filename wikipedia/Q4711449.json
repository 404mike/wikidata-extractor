As teenagers, it was Mels who pointed out that Rory had been in love with Amy for some time, which led to the two dating. In the present, Mels hijacks the TARDIS and directs it to 1939 where she is shot by Hitler (Albert Welling) and regenerates into River Song, revealing that Amy had grown up alongside her daughter, who was trained by the Silence to kill the Doctor. Amy is later persuaded by the Doctor to let her adult daughter make her own way in life. In \"The Girl Who Waited\", Amy becomes separated from the Doctor and Rory on a planet's quarantine facility and lives on her own for 36 years before they return. The Doctor wants to go back in time to rescue the younger Amy, but the older Amy insists that they take both of her. However, the Doctor knows the TARDIS will not accept the paradox and is forced to leave the older Amy behind. In \"The God Complex\", the Doctor breaks Amy's faith in him after he discovers that they are trapped in a prison for a being that kills by feeding on faith. At the conclusion of that episode, not wanting to risk their lives further, he parts ways with her and Rory after giving them a house and car. Amy appears briefly in \"Closing Time\", where she is shown to have become a fashion model, noted for a perfume campaign with the slogan \"For The Girl Who Is Tired of Waiting\". Series finale \"The Wedding of River Song\" depicts an alternate universe created by River refusing to kill the Doctor in Utah, as previously shown. Amy leads a secret organisation which fights the Silence. She reunites the Doctor with River and later kills Madame Kovarian for kidnapping Melody and depriving her of raising her baby. After history is restored, River visits Amy and reveals that the Doctor has faked his death.

In Utah they witness the Doctor dying in his relative future at the hands of a mysterious assassin. In \"The Almost People,\" it's revealed Amy has been kidnapped and replaced with a Ganger \u2013 a duplicate animated by the real Amy's consciousness \u2013 which the Doctor disintegrates upon deducing the situation, just as the real Amy goes into labour on a secret asteroid base called \"Demon's Run\". Amy gives birth to their daughter, Melody Pond, between \"The Almost People\" and \"A Good Man Goes To War\"; Madame Kovarian (Frances Barber) and the Silence plan to raise her as a weapon against the Doctor because she has been born with Time Lord-like abilities. Dressed in his centurion armor, he faces down a space fleet of Cybermen to learn Amy's location, and assists the Doctor in assembling an army to rescue her. Though Amy and Rory are distressed they were unable to save Melody from being kidnapped by Madam Kovarian, River appears at the episode's climax and reveals to Amy and Rory that she is their daughter, Melody. \"Let's Kill Hitler\" begins by revealing that Melody went on to become Amy and Rory's childhood friend, Mels, so that she might one day meet and kill the Doctor. As Amy had initially assumed Rory was gay due to his lack of interest in other women, a teenage Mels (Nina Toussaint-White) had been the one to inform Amy of Rory's affections. On 21st century Earth, Mels hijacks the TARDIS and directs it to 1938, where she is shot by Hitler (Albert Welling) and regenerates into River Song.

They accidentally save Adolf Hitler (Albert Welling) who was scheduled for torture by the Teselecta, a time-travelling justice department. When shot by Hitler, Mels unexpectedly regenerates into River Song, the grown version of Amy and Rory's child who had been taken away from them. As River is a criminal herself due to her future execution of the Doctor, the Teselecta pursue her instead, whilst the Doctor faces death from her poisoned lipstick.", "The cast and crew felt that the costume and make-up artists did a good job with Albert Welling, as he looked so much like Hitler it was a \"surreal\" experience. Ella Kenion, who plays Harriet in this episode, later appeared in the Fourth Doctor audio drama The Wrath of the Iceni where she played Boudica. Arthur Darvill was pleased that his character, Rory, was more of an \"action hero\" in the episode. Before broadcast, actor Matt Smith stated that it was \"maybe [his] favorite episode to date...it just rockets along\". Smith's Doctor debuted his secondary jacket, a long dark-green military overcoat, for the first time in this episode. In an interview for the previous series concerning the Eleventh Doctor's costume, executive producer Piers Wenger said, \"I think he'd really like to evolve it next series.
