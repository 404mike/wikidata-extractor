After a heavy defeat to Falkirk and a draw against Alloa, manager John Brown was replaced by Paul Hartley. A 3\u20130 win at Alloa for The Dark Blues and a 4\u20131 loss to Dumbarton for Hamilton Academical meant that Dundee were in the driving seat when it came to the finale.

The venue for this statement, Hearts' Riccarton training ground, led to the media dubbing the players the \"Riccarton Three\".

Despite Hearts' claims that he was ill, he was \"dropped\" to the bench for the game against Dundee United in December 2006 for what many believed to be a disciplinary measure by the club following his involvement in the \"Riccarton Three\" statement.

He followed that up with the winning goal in the final minute of their 2\u20131 UEFA Champions League group-stage win against A.C. Milan on 3 October and another last minute winner just days later at Gretna.

At the end of the season, McDonald was rewarded with a new five-year deal at Parkhead and was nominated for SPL Player of the Year.
