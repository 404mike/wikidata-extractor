The gauge of  was chosen on the recommendation of Carl Abraham Pihl, Chief Engineer of the Norwegian State Railways, who had adopted this gauge in Norway in the early 1860s. Sir Charles Fox, engineer and constructor of the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London\u2019s Hyde Park, was largely responsible for adoption of the gauge throughout the former British Empire and Colonies, it becoming commonly known as the \u2018Colonial\u2019 gauge. The objective of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was to open up the bush country north of Toronto to settlement and commerce. The lines were first surveyed by John Edward Boyd of Saint John, New Brunswick, who, as Railway Engineer of that colony in the 1860s, had advocated the construction of the New Brunswick Railway on the gauge of 3\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in. Boyd later became the Chief Engineer of the narrow-gauge Prince Edward Island Railway. The chief Engineer of both the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was Edmund Wragge, a former pupil and associate of Sir Charles Fox. Wragge returned to Britain between 1895 and 1905 and was honoured by the award of the Telford Gold Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers for his work on the approach to and construction of the London (Marylebone) terminus of the Great Central Railway. The Ontario lines were of substantial length, over  in aggregate, and both were built with the objective of connecting with a future Pacific railway, at Lake Nipissing in the case of the T&NR, and via steamers to the Lakehead in the case of the TG&BR. Only the latter was achieved. Although independent of each other financially, they were promoted and engineered by the same men and were in fact connected by a short length of third rail in the Toronto waterfront trackage of the Grand Trunk Railway. These Ontario railways attempted several innovations in addition to the adoption of the narrow gauge: the use of Clark\u2019s six wheel radial axles for longer stock \u2013 a complete failure and never used; the use of four wheel boxcars for economy and flexibility \u2013 not entirely successful; the use of large Fairlie articulated 0-6-6-0 freight locomotives (see illustration) \u2013 found very powerful and useful initially, but heavy on maintenance and not pursued further; and the early use of powerful Avonside Engine Company 4-6-0 and Baldwin Locomotive Works 2-8-0 locomotives for freight haulage \u2013 very successful engines which remained in service with the Canadian Pacific Railway after gauge standardization. Initially very successful in stimulating trade, the two railways had difficulty carrying all the traffic offered in the early 1870s. Then, after they had bought large numbers of additional freight locomotives and boxcars, the traffic fell off due to the economic depression of the mid-1870s and was insufficient to support the heavy financial burden of the capital invested. A case of \u2018too much, too late\u2019. Like all smaller railways in central Canada in the early 1880s their financial difficulties made them vulnerable in the battle for feeder routes and traffic between the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The Toronto and Nipissing Railway was amalgamated into the Midland Railway of Canada in 1881 and made standard gauge as part of the Midland's plan to obtain direct access to Toronto; later the whole enterprise was absorbed by the Grand Trunk Railway. The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway was first acquired by the Grand Trunk Railway which converted it to standard gauge in 1881, but following its own financial embarrassment it was forced to cede control to the Ontario and Quebec Railway a proxy for the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Sir Charles Fox & Sons engineered this complex scheme of high level lines at Battersea, and the widening of the railway bridge over the Thames. ", "During this period he prepared a proposal (one of several between 1850 and 1900), for a light railway in the Rother Valley of Sussex. Plans and documents developed by Sir Charles Fox and Edmund Wragge were deposited on 30 November 1865. The line was not built until 1900 when it was constructed by Colonel Fred Stephens as the Rother Valley Railway, the first of the notoriously uneconomic light railway projects that Stephens engineered. Later it became the Kent and East Sussex Railway, parts of which are now a preserved steam railway line.", "His relationship with Sir Charles continued when Fox asked him to go to Costa Rica in December 1868, to make a survey for a narrow gauge railway across the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast. On the basis of the survey, Sir Charles Fox and Sons were to submit a bid to construct the line. Wragge took along his brother in law, Leonard Carlyon, as his assistant. After a long and difficult journey by steamer to Panama, by rail across the Isthmus, another steamer to the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, followed by several days in a mule train to the capital, San Jos\u00e9, he was devastated to find that American contractors had beaten him by two weeks, and scooped up the contract. After fruitless negotiations to try to upset the provisional contract, Wragge and Carlyon set off back to England, but both contracted fever in Panama, from which Carlyon died on board ship and was buried in Jamaica.", "In 1869 Wragge applied for membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers, which was granted in January 1870. He was sponsored by Sir Charles Fox, and his candidate circular provides not only details of his career, but also an insight into Wragge's lengthy list of seconders from the railway industry, including some distinguished proponents of the narrow gauge such as Sir Henry Whatley Tyler, HM's chief inspector of railways.", "On his return from Costa Rica, Wragge's letters indicate that he worked on a project in the English Midlands for some months until Sir Charles Fox secured for him the position of chief engineer of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway (TG&BR),  and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway (T&NR) in July 1869. This placement must have been settled by telegram, because Douglas Fox left Toronto on 27 July 1869, promising to have an engineer sent out, and Edmund Wragge departed for Norway to see Pihl's narrow gauge railways on 1 August 1869. Wragge arrived in Toronto in September 1869 and between that time and late 1874 he engineered and constructed over 280 route miles of the 3\u00a0ft\u00a06\u00a0in gauge railways, at a total cost of \u00a3900,000. The railways were built economically as a practical means of opening up the interior of the province of Ontario to settlement.", "Wragge returned occasionally to Britain during this period and a letter in his 1883 correspondence indicates that he was working there with Sir Charles Fox and Sons on negotiations for the building of the Quebec North Shore Railway. Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, the president of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) asked Wragge in 1888 to act as an arbitrator in compensation negotiations between the CPR and the Canadian government.", "His work on the rebuilding of Union Station and continued association with Douglas Fox led to his return to Britain, at the age of 60, in 1896,  to participate in the building of the last main line into Central London, that of the Great Central Railway. Construction of this heavily engineered connection commenced in late 1894, of which the most difficult part was to drive a mainline railway through the London suburbs to a terminus at Marylebone. This was the section for which Sir Charles Fox and Sons were the consultants. Edmund Wragge was the resident engineer from 1897 to 1899 and lived in the St Marylebone district, close to the construction works. The completion of the line in March 1899, was marked by the presentation of several technical papers to the Institution of Civil Engineers. G. A. Hobson and Edmund Wragge gave a lengthy and detailed paper in November 1900, describing the engineering and construction of the approaches to Marylebone Station. The Institution Of Civil Engineers awarded Wragge and Hobson the Telford Medal and premiums for this work. Hobson is credited with the design of the great railway bridge of 1905 over the Zambezi River at Victoria Falls."]}, {"page": "Mount Fox (Canada)", "response": ["Mount Fox is a  mountain on the shared border between Alberta and British Columbia, Canada.
