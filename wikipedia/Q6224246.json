He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in 1854 during the Crimean War. However, in 1872 he ruined his career when he put his battleship HMS Lord Clyde aground at Pantellaria, resulting in his dismissal from his ship; he was never employed at sea again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| John Bythesea || Royal Navy || 1854 || Crimean War || \u00c5land Islands"]}, {"page": "Battle of Bomarsund", "response": ["* John Bythesea \u2013 1854; \u00c5land Islands"]}, {"page": "Royal Indian Navy", "response": ["# Captain John Bythesea, R.N.

The two men spent two nights reconnoitring the island, being helped by a local farmer and his daughter to evade capture by the Russians and on 12 August when the despatches arrived, they ambushed the five Russians carrying them. Two of the carriers dropped their mail bags and ran, but the other three surrendered and were taken to the Arrogant. In this action the Officer and Leading Stoker were armed with just one pistol and a knife. Upon their return, the Commanders of both the English and French ships in the fleet were delighted, with the French being involved in suggesting they both be awarded the Victoria Cross. His RN records in the UK National Archives show he was a Leading Stoker until May 24th, 1856 when he was demoted to Ship's Cook until his demise. The reason for the demotion is not given, but given his good character throughout his career at sea, it is assumed by his descendants that there was cause to place him in such a lowly position on board."]}, {"page": "USS Miantonomoh (1863)", "response": ["Miantonomoh, named after the Narragansett chief, Miantonomoh,Miantonomoh I (Mon) was laid down in 1862 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York, launched on 15 August 1863, and commissioned on 15 September 1865 with Commander Daniel Ammen in command.

Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off four days later and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months.
