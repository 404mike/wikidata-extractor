His impressive performances for the \"Potters\" led to him being signed by Newcastle United for a fee of \u00a31.5million in January 1998. He spent six years on Tyneside before moving south to Portsmouth in 2004. He was unable to establish himself as first choice right back at \"Pompey\" and re-joined his old club Stoke on loan for the 2006\u201307 season.\nStoke narrowly missed out on a play-off position and so Griffin decided to sign for newly promoted Derby County, however with Derby struggling to compete in the Premier League he joined Stoke for a third time in January 2008. He helped Stoke to claim promotion and was made captain of the side for the 2008\u201309 season. Griffin lost his place in the side after an on the pitch altercation with Ricardo Fuller at West Ham United in December 2008. He joined Reading in 2010 helping them gain promotion at the second attempt after failing in the play-offs. He was released by Reading in May 2012 and joined Doncaster Rovers in October 2012. He spent two years at Doncaster before ending his career with a short spell at Chester", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ricardo Fuller", "response": ["Fuller was sent off for violent conduct on 28 December 2008 against West Ham United. Following West Ham's equaliser, Fuller argued with team-mate Andy Griffin, before slapping the Stoke captain's face. Referee Mike Jones gave Fuller a straight red for violent conduct and West Ham went on to win the match 2\u20131. Tony Pulis and Stoke teammate Danny Higginbotham commented that the incident would not affect the club. On 1 January 2009, Tony Pulis confirmed that Fuller and Griffin had \"kissed and made up\" after a team meeting. Fuller said Griffin had been \"very rude and disrespectful\", but accepted that his actions had been worse. In a match against Sunderland in February 2009 Fuller dislocated his shoulder and it was feared that he would be out injured for the rest of the season. However Fuller made a quick recover and was out for just two weeks. He bounced back with lively performances against Aston Villa and a goal against Bolton and continued his form to help Stoke to safety."]}, {"page": "Tony Pulis", "response": ["Pulis bolstered his squad for the 2006\u201307 season with the permanent additions of Danny Higginbotham, Ricardo Fuller and Vincent P\u00e9ricard. His most notable coup was the loan signing of Lee Hendrie from Aston Villa. Hendrie's arrival along with the loan signings of Salif Diao, Andy Griffin and Rory Delap coincided with a change of form for the Potters following a poor start to the season. Stoke went as high as fourth in the table prior to the January transfer window."]}, {"page": "Steven Caldwell", "response": ["In the 2000\u201301 season, Caldwell was called up to the first team, with Manager Bobby Robson said: \"Caldwell's got a good pedigree. I like to put people in when it's right and when it's necessary and I can afford to do it, and not when we are forced to do it. But we are going to have the confidence with the lad to do it. He's a steady character, has indomitable spirit and we like him very much.\" Caldwell made his Newcastle United debut on 30 September 2000 against Manchester City, coming on as a second half substitute for Andy Griffin, and played the rest of the game, keeping a clean sheet, in a 1\u20130 win. On 1 November 2000, he made his first start for the club against Bradford City in the League Cup and scored his first goal for Newcastle United, as they won 4\u20133. Since making his debut for the club, Caldwell rotated in and out of the first team, due to facing competitions in the defence. He then featured four more times for Newcastle United by the end of the year, making three starts. It wasn't until on 3 March 2001 when Caldwell made his first appearances in two months, due to a thigh injury, starting the whole game, in a 1\u20131 draw against Everton. He later made two more appearances by the end of the 2000\u201301 season.

He fell out with Chief Executive Jez Moxey over how to spend the proceeds of the sale; Moxey wanted Marco Gabbiadini but Kamara vetoed the deal. He instead spent \u00a3350,000 on Coventry City striker Kyle Lightbourne. In his 14 games in charge with the \"Potters\", only one was won and he was dismissed on 8 April 1998.
