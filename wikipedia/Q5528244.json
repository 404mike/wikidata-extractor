Baroque in its physicality, it suggests folds of flesh or fabric tumbling through space. Cumulus also reflects themes of technology and innovation, as LaMonte told Caltech magazine: Every aspect of the project forced me to engage with new technologies. I needed data to divine the form, a supercomputer to model the weather, scientists to calculate the water weight of the cloud, and the precision afforded by robots to transfigure a real cloud into marble with an exact weight equivalency.In reaction to Cumulus, Cloud Appreciation Society founder Gavin Pretor-Pinney noted that the word \u201ccloud\u201d is derived from the Old English word \u201cclud,\u201d which refers to a mass or rock or earth. He expressed intrigue at seeing \u201ca cloud made of rock, since this is where the word originally came from.\u201d"]}]}}
