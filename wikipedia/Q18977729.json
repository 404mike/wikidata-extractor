Neil Lennon, who returned to Celtic as manager later in the season, said in July 2019 that he had wanted to sign Christie for Hibernian during the summer of 2018 as part of a proposed deal for John McGinn. In the 2018\u201319 League Cup semi-final against Hearts at Murrayfield, Christie won a penalty, caused a goalkeeping error and hit a \"wonderful left-foot shot\" leading to each goal in the eventual 3\u20130 victory. Christie signed a new contract with Celtic in November 2018. On 2 December, he scored the only goal of the 2018 Scottish League Cup Final at Hampden against former club Aberdeen. His season ended abruptly on 14 April 2019 in the Scottish Cup semi-final, again at Hampden against Aberdeen, when he suffered facial fractures in an aerial collision with opponent Dominic Ball, who was sent off for the reckless nature of the challenge.Celtic star Ryan Christie shares gruesome photo showing damage from Dom Ball collision, Daily Record, 15 April 2019Ryan Christie to undergo facial surgery after incident in Celtic-Aberdeen Scottish Cup semi-final, The Scotsman, 16 April 2019"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season", "response": ["| Dominic Ball"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|22 January 2015||DF|| Dominic Ball|| Tottenham Hotspur||30 June 2015||"]}, {"page": "Nathan Oduwa", "response": ["On 13 August 2015, Oduwa, alongside Spurs teammate, Dominic Ball, signed for Scottish Championship club Rangers on season-long loans.
