His football career began as a schoolboy with Arsenal, after which he joined Chelsea's ground staff. While with Chelsea he played for England at youth international level.

In the 1966\u201367 season, he was the club's joint top scorer, alongside Kit Napier, with ten goals in all competitions, but a perceived lack of pace stopped him establishing himself as a first-team regular.
