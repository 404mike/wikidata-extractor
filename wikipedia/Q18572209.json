In the 1970s, she taught other campuses in the United States, Europe, and Africa few are Harvard University, Union Theological Seminary, and the University of Ibadan. In this period of teaching, she realized that \u201cpeople who wrote about Africa and Christianity in Africa, were not Africans.\u201d Also, the Africans who wrote about Christianity were men, having only \u201cmale face in mind.\" These facts made Oduyoye continue to pursue activism in challenging the status quo in Africa where women were silenced, in this case voicing for African women and theology. As she notes, \u201cliberation theology became my theology voice.\u201d Oduyoye led a few organizations besides her teaching career, such as the Ecumenical Association of Third-World Theologian (EATWOT). From 1967 to 1979, she was youth education secretary for the World Council of Churches; from 1987 to 1994, she was Deputy General Secretary for the same organization. She has taught at Harvard University, Union Theological Seminary, and the University of Ibadan. She has also served as president of the World Student Christian Federation and founded the Circle of Concerned African Women Theologians in 1989. During her time in the US, Oduyoye experienced the Black Liberation theology and womanist theologymovements. The subject \u201cliberation theology was not sensitive to feminist issues\" was a criticism from Oduyoye. She saw issues of sexuality that feminist in the western part of the world stress as their main topic not applicable to African women. In the US, Alice Walker brought about a campaign through a novel and documentary, Mary Daly published Gyn/ecology on the issues of genital mutilation as a primary concern for all women. Contrary to this, Oduyoye says that womanist theology from the African perspective underlines poverty and discrimination upon women. Secondly, the problem for Oduyoye was Westerners only report about the good works of the missionaries and their benefit upon the population of Africa, all too good to be true. She disrupts the above narrative and insists Africans have a culture and tradition nonconformitive to western ideals. For Oduyoye, \u201cthe Bible is not British culture or French culture or European culture.\u201d In totality, her work around African women's theology, in this case, was improving what African men have started. Theology in Africa was a two-winged theology, where men and women were making the appropriate improvement together, narrating two necessary viewpoints. The approach missionaries had on converting a person to Christianity by giving up one's culture seemed inappropriate. Oduyoye saw the need to revitalize African theology as \u201c...a prerequisite to other independences.\" Oduyoye has written four books and more than eighty articles focusing on Christian theology from a feminist and African perspective. Oduyoye has been awarded honorary degrees by University of Amsterdam (1991), Stellenbosch University the University of the Western Cape in 2002 and Yale University in 2008.Mary E.
