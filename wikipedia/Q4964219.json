He made 197 appearances in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle, scoring 40 goals, and a further seven while on loan at Torquay United.He began his career as an apprentice with Plymouth Argyle before making his first team debut in August 1973 at the age of 17. A key member of the side that won promotion to the Second Division in 1975, alongside the strike-duo of Paul Mariner and Billy Rafferty, he was considered to be a reliable and consistent performer throughout his stay with the Pilgrims. During a reserve team game in 1981, Johnson was knocked unconscious in a collision with teammate Neil Hards. He suffered a fractured cheekbone and damage to both eyes, which required surgery and his jawbone to be wired up. He resumed training four weeks later, but during his second loan stint with Torquay United he experienced severe pain when heading the ball. Rather than risk permanent blindness, Johnson retired at the age of 26.Johnson made 231 appearances in all competitions for Plymouth Argyle between 1973 and 1981, scoring 43 goals. During his two loan stints with Torquay United, Johnson scored two goals in seven appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Johnson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Brian Johnson (born 1947) is British lead singer of Australian hard rock band AC/DC.", "*Brian Johnson (special effects artist) (born 1939), film and TV special effects director", "*Brian Johnson, character in the television series My Parents Are Aliens", "*Brian Johnson, character in the film The Breakfast Club", "*Brian Johnson (Bethel Music singer) (born 1978), lead singer in Bethel Music and member of the duo Brian & Jenn Johnson", "*Brian Johnson (TV personality), better known as Chad Johnson, reality TV personality", "*Brian Johnson (fullback) (born 1979), American NFL football player for the San Francisco 49ers", "*Brian Johnson (American football coach) (born 1987), American NFL football coach", "*Brian Johnson (kicker) (born 1999), American NFL football placekicker", "*Brian Johnson (footballer, born 1930) (1930\u20132013), English footballer", "*Brian Johnson (footballer, born 1948), English footballer for Tranmere Rovers", "*Brian Johnson (footballer, born 1955), English footballer", "*Brian Johnson (soccer) (born 1974), American soccer midfielder", "*Brian Johnson (Australian footballer) (1932\u20132015), Australian rules footballer", "*Brian Johnson (rugby league) (1956\u20132016), Australian rugby league footballer and coach", "*Brian Johnson (ice hockey) (born 1960), Canadian ice hockey winger", "*Brian Johnson (catcher) (born 1968), American baseball player", "*Brian Johnson Jr. (born 1979), American stock car racing driver", "*Brian Johnson (long jumper) (born 1980), American long jumper", "*Brian Johnson (curler) (fl. 1990s), Australian curler", "*Brian Johnson (pitcher) (born 1990), American baseball player", "*Brian Johnson (figure skater) (born 1995), American pair skater", "*Brian Johnson (politician) (born 1961), Minnesota politician and member of the Minnesota House of Representatives"]}, {"page": "Brian Johnson (footballer born 1955)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Johnson (footballer, born 1955)"]}]}}
