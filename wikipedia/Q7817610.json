He began his career in Northern Ireland with Irish Intermediate League side Crusaders while also serving as a policeman. He joined Football League First Division side Cardiff City in 1924 where he spent five years and made more than 90 appearances in all competitions. His playing time with the club was often limited due to competition with club captain Fred Keenor, but he did play for the side in the 1927 FA Cup Final as they defeated Arsenal to become the only team from outside England to win the competition.\nAfter falling out of favour, he returned to Northern Ireland in 1929 to join Linfield and captained the side to both the Irish League and Irish Cup titles in his first two seasons. In 1932, he was appointed player-manager of Portadown and led the club to their first senior trophy since joining the Intermediate League by winning the Gold Cup in 1934. He also achieved the highest points total in the club's history during the 1936\u201337 season. His success led to his appointment as manager of Linfield in 1937, but he returned to Portadown after a year.\nIn 1939, Sloan stepped down as Portadown manager to enlist in the Royal Army Service Corps during World War II. He served for two years before being discharged due to injuries sustained in an accident. After the war, he had two short spells as Portadown manager and also coached at the club for many years. He also won 11 caps for the Ireland national team during his career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portadown F.C.", "response": ["|  Tom Sloan"]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| || Tom Sloan"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Nelson (footballer)", "response": ["Nelson was born in Greenock, Scotland, the sixth son of Alexander Nelson and his wife Jeanie. The family moved to Northern Ireland when Nelson was seven where his father was employed as a ship builder. He started his football career there with junior sides St Paul's and Glenarm, initially playing as a forward. At senior level, he joined Irish Intermediate League side Crusaders in 1919 where he was described as a \"fullback with great promise\". His spell with the team was disrupted by a broken leg during his second season, however he was still chosen to represent an Irish League XI on several occasions and captained the side against their English counterparts. He was spotted by Fred Stewart, manager of Welsh side Cardiff City, who paid \u00a3500 to complete a transfer to Cardiff. Such was Nelson's success at Cardiff that the Welsh side sent a message to Crusaders asking \"Have you any more players like Jimmy?\".

Despite a 1\u20131 draw with Newcastle United on 20 September, Stewart initiated changes for a home match against Manchester United five days later, handing debuts to new signings Baillie, Curtis and Pirie and bringing in Tom Sloan for his first appearance of the season. The changes proved ineffectual however and Cardiff fell to a 2\u20130 defeat. The only one of Stewart's debutants to retain their place for the following match was 19-year-old Curtis, who scored his first goal for the club in a 6\u20133 defeat to fellow strugglers Derby County. Cardiff had been leading the match 3\u20132 at half time and The Times remarked that they looked the more likely to continue scoring at the start of the second half.

Two players, Davy McDougall and Richie Morgan, went on to manage the team. McDougall was appointed as the club's first manager in 1910 and remained in the role until the following year. Morgan managed the side between 1978 and 1981 before moving into another role at the club. Despite only appearing in 25 matches for Cardiff, Robin Friday is regarded as one of the most notable cult heroes in the club's history due to his performances and his personality.

Harry Beadles had arrived at the club from Liverpool immediately following the end of the previous season and had been part of the club's overseas tour.

Ferguson returned in a 1\u20131 draw with Arsenal, with Tom Sloan scoring his first league goal for the club. However, Sloan also succumbed to injury after the game and, like Nelson, would appear in only two further league matches for the rest of the season.
