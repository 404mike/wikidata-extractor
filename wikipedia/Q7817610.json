He began his career in Ireland with Irish Intermediate League side Crusaders while also serving as a policeman. He joined Football League First Division side Cardiff City in 1924 where he spent five years and made more than 90 appearances in all competitions. His playing time with the club was often limited due to competition with club captain Fred Keenor, but he did play for the side in the 1927 FA Cup Final as they defeated Arsenal to become the only team from outside England to win the competition.\nAfter falling out of favour, he returned to Ireland in 1929 to join Linfield and captained the side to both the Irish League and Irish Cup titles in his first two seasons. In 1932, he was appointed player-manager of Portadown and led the club to their first senior trophy since joining the Intermediate League by winning the Gold Cup in 1934. He also achieved the highest points total in the club's history during the 1936\u201337 season. His success led to his appointment as manager of Linfield in 1937, but he returned to Portadown after a year.\nIn 1939, Sloan stepped down as Portadown manager to enlist in the Royal Army Service Corps during World War II. He served for two years before being discharged due to injuries sustained in an accident. After the war, he had two short spells as Portadown manager and also coached at the club for many years. He also won 11 caps for the Ireland national team during his career.", "link_mentions": {}}}
