Despite being overlooked by England for the first Test of the summer, in May Mahmood secured his career-best bowling figures and his maiden 10-wicket haul. In a Lancashire victory over Worcestershire by six wickets, Mahmood took 6/75 and finished with match figures of 10/140. Mahmood was one of several Lancashire bowlers unable to play in August 2009. He, Glen Chapple, Steven Cheetham, and Tom Smith were injured and Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson were on England duty. As a stop-gap measure, Tom Lungley was loaned by Lancashire from Derbyshire County Cricket Club. After he finished the season with 41\u00a0first-class wickets at an average of 34.00, and 24\u00a0list\u00a0A wickets at an average of 23.33, Mahmood was recalled to the England One Day International squad for their tour of South Africa in the winter of 2009."]}, {"page": "Tom Lungley", "response": ["In August 2009, Lungley was given a taste of cricket in the first division of the County Championship when he played for Lancashire on loan. At the time, the club's bowling attack had been severely depleted by injuries to Glen Chapple, Steven Cheetham, and Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson were on England duty."]}, {"page": "Tom Smith (cricketer, born 1985)", "response": ["During a Roses Match in late July, Smith took career best figures of 6/46, his maiden first-class five-wicket haul. Smith and Paul Horton then proceeded to share in their highest opening partnership in the County Championship. After the match, Smith commented \"I am really enjoying the opening role. In one-day cricket especially it is great, but opening in any form of the game I am enjoying\". Moores' faith in Smith's batting was further repaid in a match against Hampshire, when Smith scored 95; however, in the match Smith suffered a stomach strain. This coincided with injuries to Glen Chapple, Steven Cheetham, and Sajid Mahmood and with Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson on England duty, Lancashire's bowling attack was severely depleted.
