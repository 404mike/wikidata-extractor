During Glock's tenure, the profile and fortunes of the BBC SO began to rise.  Glock engaged Antal Dor\u00e1ti as the orchestra's principal conductor.  Heyworth judged that Dor\u00e1ti raised standards of playing and brought new vigour to the programmes in his four years in charge (1962\u20131966). Dor\u00e1ti was convinced that the orchestra was stultified by concentrating on studio broadcasts, as it did except during the Proms season. He strove to free players from \"slavery to the microphone\", and Glock promoted a regular series of concerts at the Festival Hall.Glock, p. 106 The music critic Tom Sutcliffe later wrote that Dor\u00e1ti and his successors, Colin Davis (1967\u201371), Pierre Boulez (1971\u201375) and Gennady Rozhdestvensky (1978\u201381) had been partly successful in improving playing standards, but had not brought the orchestra up to its original level of distinction."]}, {"page": "English National Opera", "response": ["Poor average box-office sales led to a financial crisis, exacerbated by backstage industrial relations problems.Gilbert, pp. 371\u2013372 After 1983, the company ceased touring to other British venues.Gilbert, p. 312 Assessing the achievements of the 'Powerhouse' years, Tom Sutcliffe wrote in The Musical Times:", "Martin Smith, a millionaire with a finance background, was appointed chairman of the ENO board in 2001.
