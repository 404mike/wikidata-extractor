The government grant to the council was capped effecting a real-terms reduction in funding, though it was argued that any shortfall would be made up by increased sponsorship from the private sector. The secretary-general from 1975 to 1983, Roy Shaw, the last secretary-general to be knighted, faced the difficult task of reconciling the needs of arts organisations with the restricted funding. William Rees-Mogg was a political appointment as chairman and proposed slimming down the council's responsibilities. This led to a series of clashes with prominent figures from the arts such as Peter Hall, who resigned from the council in protest. In 1987 the restructure inspired by Rees-Mogg cut by half the number of organisations receiving Arts Council funding. During the same period the Arts Council began encouraging a greater level of corporate sponsorship for the arts."]}, {"page": "Firth Park Academy", "response": ["* Roy Shaw, Secretary General from 1975\u201383 of the Arts Council of Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Roy Shaw", "response": ["On his release from prison, Shaw started fighting unlicensed (i.e. not sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control)Gary Holland \"History of London Boxing\", 9 April 2008 boxing matches in 1978, aged 42, and gained many infamous victories, including one over Donnie \"The Bull\" Adams.
