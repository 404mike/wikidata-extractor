The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable. Frank Harris, his friend and editor, wrote a biography, Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde. Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. Oscar Wilde and Myself (1914), largely ghost-written by T. W. H. Crosland, vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work. Later, in Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up (1939) and his Autobiography he was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, Robert Sherard; Robert Ross, his literary executor; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit (1946). In 1954 Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published his memoir Son of Oscar Wilde, which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment. It was revised and updated by Merlin Holland in 1989."]}, {"page": "Robbie Ross", "response": ["During the First World War, Ross mentored a group of young, mostly homosexual, poets and artists including Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen.

Hirschfeld visited Cambridge University in 1905 to meet Wilde's son, Vyvyan Holland, who had changed his surname to avoid being associated with his father. Hirschfeld noted \"the name Wilde\" has, since his trial, sounded like \"an indecent word, which causes homosexuals to blush with shame, women to avert their eyes, and normal men to be outraged\". During his visit to Britain, Hirschfeld was invited to a secret ceremony in the English countryside where a \"group of beautiful, young, male students\" from Cambridge gathered together wearing Wilde's prison number, C33, as a way of symbolically linking his fate to theirs, to read out aloud Wilde's poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol. Hirschfeld found the reading of The Ballad of Reading Gaol to be \"markersch\u00fctternd\" (shaken to the core of one's being, i.e. something that is emotionally devastating), going on to write that the poem reading was \"the most earth-shattering outcry that has ever been voiced by a downtrodden soul about its own torture and that of humanity\". By the end of the reading of The Ballad of Reading Gaol, Hirshfeld felt \"quiet joy\" as he was convinced that, despite the way that Wilde's life had been ruined, something good would eventually come of it."]}, {"page": "Cyril Holland", "response": ["Cyril Holland (born Cyril Wilde, 5 June 1885 \u2013 9 May 1915) was the older of the two sons of Oscar Wilde and Constance Lloyd and brother to Vyvyan Holland.", "According to his brother Vyvyan Holland's accounts in his autobiography, Son of Oscar Wilde (1954), Oscar was a devoted and loving father to his two sons.
