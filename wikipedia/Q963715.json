He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge (1913\u201315).\nJames's work as a medievalist and scholar is still highly regarded, but he is best remembered for his ghost stories, which some consider among the best in the genre. He redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic clich\u00e9s of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, his protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests. Accordingly, he is known as the originator of the \"antiquarian ghost story\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberdeen Bestiary", "response": ["The Aberdeen Bestiary and the Ashmole Bestiary are considered by Xenia Muratova, a professor of art history, to be \"the work of different artists belonging to the same artistic milieu.\" Due to their \"striking similarities\" they are often compared and described by scholars as being \"sister manuscripts.\" The medievalist scholar M.

Gale also said that \"Lovecraft at his best could build a mood of horror unsurpassed; at his worst, he was laughable.\" In 1962, Colin Wilson, in his survey of anti-realist trends in fiction The Strength to Dream, cited Lovecraft as one of the pioneers of the \"assault on rationality\" and included him with M. R. James, H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, J. R. R. Tolkien and others as one of the builders of mythicised realities contending against what he considered the failing project of literary realism.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 289. 28 August 1814\u00a0\u2013 7 February 1873) was an Irish writer of Gothic tales, mystery novels, and horror fiction. He was a leading ghost story writer of his time, central to the development of the genre in the Victorian era.Sullivan, Jack, \"Le Fanu, Sheridan\". In Sullivan, ed., The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural. New York: Viking. pp. 257\u201362.  M. R. James described Le Fanu as \"absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories\".Briggs, Julia (1986). \"James, M(ontague) R(hodes)\". In Sullivan, Jack, ed. The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural. New York: Viking. pp. 233\u201335.    Three of his best-known works are the locked-room mystery Uncle Silas, the lesbian vampire novella Carmilla, and the historical novel The House by the Churchyard.", "Le Fanu worked in many genres but remains best known for his horror fiction. He was a meticulous craftsman and frequently reworked plots and ideas from his earlier writing in subsequent pieces. Many of his novels, for example, are expansions and refinements of earlier short stories. He specialised in tone and effect rather than \"shock horror\" and liked to leave important details unexplained and mysterious. He avoided overt supernatural effects: in most of his major works, the supernatural is strongly implied but a \"natural\" explanation is also possible. The demonic monkey in \"Green Tea\" could be a delusion of the story's protagonist, who is the only person to see it; in \"The Familiar\", Captain Barton's death seems to be supernatural, but is not actually witnessed, and the ghostly owl may be a real bird. This technique influenced later horror artists, both in print and on film (see, for example, the film producer Val Lewton's principle of \"indirect horror\"). Though other writers have since chosen less subtle techniques, Le Fanu's finest tales, such as the vampire novella Carmilla and the short story \"Schalken the Painter\", remain some of the most powerful in the genre. He had enormous influence on one of the 20th century's most important ghost story writers, M. R. James, and although his work fell out of favour in the early part of the 20th century, towards the end of the century interest in his work increased and remains comparatively strong.", "* \"Strange Event in the Life of Schalken the Painter\" (1839), a disturbing version of the demon lover motif. This tale was inspired by the atmospheric candlelit scenes of the 17th-century Dutch painter Godfried Schalcken, who is the model for the story's protagonist. M. R. James stated that \"Schalken' conforms more strictly to my own ideals. It is indeed one of the best of Le Fanu's good things\".

James, several other writers have expressed strong admiration for Le Fanu's fiction. E. F. Benson stated that Le Fanu's stories \"Green Tea\", \"The Familiar\", and \"Mr. Justice Harbottle\" \"are instinct with an awfulness which custom cannot stale, and this quality is due, as in The Turn of the Screw, to Le Fanu's admirably artistic methods in setting and narration\". Benson added, \"[Le Fanu's] best work is of the first rank, while as a 'flesh-creeper' he is unrivalled. No one else has so sure a touch in mixing the mysterious atmosphere in which horror darkly breeds\".E. F. Benson. \"Sheridan Le Fanu\". In Harold Bloom, Classic Horror Writers. New York: Chelsea House, 1994. pp. 48\u201349.  Jack Sullivan has asserted that Le Fanu is \"one of the most important and innovative figures in the development of the ghost story\" and that Le Fanu's work has had \"an incredible influence on the genre; [he is] regarded by M. R. James, E. F. Bleiler, and others as the most skilful writer of supernatural fiction in English.\"", "Le Fanu's work influenced several later writers.

Lovecraft, who in his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" named Machen as one of the four \"modern masters\" of supernatural horror (with Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, and M. R. James). Machen's influence on Lovecraft's own work was substantial. Lovecraft's reading of Machen in the early 1920s led him away from his earlier Dunsanian writing towards the development of what became the Cthulhu Mythos. Machen's use of a contemporary Welsh or London background in which sinister ancient horrors lurk and are capable of interbreeding with modern people obviously helped inspire Lovecraft's similar use of a New England background. Machen's story \"The White People\" includes references to curious unknown rites and beings, an idea Lovecraft uses frequently in the mythos."]}, {"page": "Eton College", "response": ["Among headmasters of the 20th century were Cyril Alington, Robert Birley and Anthony Chenevix-Trench.

He continued acting in school plays, though \"the laurels deservedly went to Patrick Macnee.\" Lee applied for a scholarship to Eton, where his interview was in the presence of the ghost story author M. R. James. His poor maths skills meant that he was placed eleventh, and thus missed out on being a King's Scholar by one place. His step-father was not prepared to pay the higher fees that being an Oppidan Scholar meant,and so he instead attended Wellington College, where he won scholarships in the classics, studying Ancient Greek and Latin. Aside from a \"tiny part\" in a school play, he didn't act while at Wellington. He was a \"passable\" racquets player and fencer and a competent cricketer but did not do well at the other sports played: hockey, football, rugby and boxing. He disliked the parades and weapons training and would always \"play dead\" as soon as possible during mock battles. Lee was frequently beaten at school, including once at Wellington for \"being beaten too often,\" though he accepted them as \"logical and therefore acceptable\" punishments for knowingly breaking the rules.

His fictional worlds feel unusual, threatening, and dislocated. Such an approach prompted Peter Straub to write in a blurb for one of Campbell's early novels: \"Horrors in his fiction are never merely invented, they are felt and experienced, and affect the reader for days afterward.\" The horrors Campbell evokes are commonly suggested to the reader by ambiguous allusions to events his characters are not always mindful of. In this regard, his approach is similar to that of M. R. James. Indeed, Campbell celebrates James's concentrated prose, choice of detail, and ability to hint at disquieting material much larger than what is explicitly revealed. Campbell has described much of his own later work as \"comedies of paranoia\", as his characters experience an existential bewilderment that borders on the absurd.", "Campbell has edited a number of anthologies, including New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos (1980); New Terrors and New Terrors II, a groundbreaking two-volume anthology series; and (with Stephen Jones) the first five volumes of the annual Best New Horror series (1990\u20131994). His 1992 anthology Uncanny Banquet was notable for including the first ever reprint of the obscure 1914 horror novel The Hole of the Pit by Adrian Ross. The Gruesome Book was a paperback anthology of horror tales for children. Campbell is extremely well-read in the horror field, and some of his own literary influences are demonstrated by his selections for the 1988 anthology Fine Frights: Stories That Scared Me. In 2002 he edited a collection of fiction in the tradition of M. R. James, entitled Meddling with Ghosts.
