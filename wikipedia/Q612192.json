Other future New England colonists who participated in the planning were Thomas Hooker, Roger Williams, John Winthrop, and Emmanuel Downing.  Cotton did not emigrate for several more years, though he did travel to Southampton to preach the farewell sermon to Winthrop's party.

He soon ruled out Holland, however, because of the negative feedback from fellow minister Thomas Hooker who had previously gone there.", "Members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony heard about Cotton's flight and sent him letters urging him to come to New England.  None of the great Puritan clergymen had gone there, and he felt that it would put him at too great a distance to return should the situation in England warrant.

Also on board was Edward Hutchinson, the oldest son of Anne Hutchinson who was traveling with his uncle Edward.  Cotton's wife bore their son during the voyage, and they named him Seaborn.  Eighteen months after his departure from England, Cotton wrote that his decision to emigrate was not difficult to make; he found preaching in a new land to be far preferable to \"sitting in a loathsome prison.\"", "Cotton and Thomas Hooker were the first eminent ministers to come to New England, according to Cotton's biographer Larzer Ziff. Cotton was openly welcomed on his arrival in September 1633 as one of the two ministers of the church in Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, having been personally invited to the colony by Governor Winthrop. Ziff writes, \"It was only fitting, the majority felt, that the most eminent preacher in the colony should be located in the principal city.\" Also, many who had come from Boston, Lincolnshire had settled in Boston, Massachusetts.", "Modern scholars agree that Cotton was the most eminent of New England's early ministers.

Historian Sargeant Bush notes that Cotton provided leadership both in England and America through his preaching, books, and his life as a nonconformist preacher, and that he became a leader in congregational autonomy, responsible for giving congregationalism its name.

Even those who were Winthrop's close allies, such as Rev. Thomas Hooker, who cofounded the colony of Connecticut, were repulsed by his personality. As such, many left the colony and any Antinomians who didn't leave voluntarily were forced out, banished, or excommunicated (such as Rev. John Wheelwright who founded Exeter, New Hampshire, and his sister-in-law, Anne (Marbury) Hutchinson, who founded a new colony in what later became Rhode Island).", "Eaton's older brother, Gov. Theophilus Eaton, led the group along with John Davenport as their religious leader. They intended to start their own settlement \u2013 probably due in part to the commanding persona of John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony at the time (1637 to 1640, and many other terms). Winthrop was termed \"an object of great fear in all the colonies,\" and caused the Rev. Thomas Hooker and others to go off and form their own colonies as well. Deciding that he didn't want to be involved in the animosity, he\u00a0\u2013 like Rev. Thomas Hooker before him\u00a0\u2013 founded a new colony, the colony of New Haven, though Winthrop and others literally begged both of them to stay."]}, {"page": "James Hutchinson Woodworth", "response": ["In Chicago, Woodworth married Almyra Booth, the daughter of Walter Booth of Paris, Illinois. She was a member of the Booth family that settled in Indiana from their homes in Connecticut; their American ancestry stretched back to the founder of Connecticut, the Reverend Thomas Hooker. The Booth family was noted for its interest in public service, and this both influenced and supported Woodworth's own career in politics. Almyra Booth was related to both California Governor Newton Booth and the author Booth Tarkington. Woodworth and Almyra Booth had three children, two of whom died in infancy. Their daughter Virginia Almyra Woodworth was married to Tunis B. Van Wyck whose own ancestry could be traced back to the earliest inhabitants of the Dutch colonies in the New World, including the New Amsterdam and Long Island colonies which eventually became New York State.  Through Virginia Van Wyck, the Woodworths had one surviving grandchild, Virginia Almyra Van Wyck who married George Pope of Glencoe, Illinois."]}, {"page": "Richard Mather", "response": ["He had a great reputation as a preacher in and about Liverpool; but, advised by letters of John Cotton and Thomas Hooker, he was persuaded to join the company of pilgrims in May 1635 and embarked at Bristol for New England."]}, {"page": "Contrition", "response": ["Puritan preacher Thomas Hooker defined contrition as \"nothing else, namely, when a sinner by the sight of sin and vileness of it, and the punishment due to the same, is made sensible of sin, and is made to hate it, and hath his heart separated from the same.\""]}, {"page": "Little Englander", "response": ["The term \"little England\" predates its political usage; the expression \"this little England\" was used in the Gunpowder Day sermon of the English Puritan preacher Thomas Hooker (5 November 1626).p.62 of The Puritans in America: A Narrative Anthology, edited by Alan Heimert and Andrew Delbanco.
