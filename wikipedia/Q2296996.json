He was Brian Clough's first signing as manager of Hartlepool. He was a mainstay of the side which won promotion from the Fourth Division in the 1967\u201368 season, and won the club's inaugural Player of the Year award.In 1972 the club was on the brink of going out of business, needing to sell a player to survive, when Clough, by then manager of Derby County, bid \u00a32,500 for the player. It is usually regarded as a philanthropic gesture by Clough (albeit using Derby's money) as Parry made few appearances for Derby before moving on to Mansfield Town.He later played non-league football for Gresley Rovers, where he was Player of the Year in the 1982\u201383 season.In February 2009, Parry made a triumphant return to the North East as guest of honour at Hartlepool United's centenary dinner. Barry Butlin, Secretary & Treasurer of Derby County Former Players' Association, said: \"It is fitting that Tony's fans at Hartlepool and in the North East had the opportunity to honour him at the 'Centenary' celebrations, and Tony was delighted to be greeted by his telly idol Jeff Stelling.\"Parry died suddenly on 23 November 2009, following a short battle with pneumonia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["* 1968  Tony Parry"]}, {"page": "Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)", "response": ["Before their arrival, Hartlepools had been forced to apply for re-election to the Football League five times in the previous six years, and Taylor stated that the squad were all free transfer signings and some of the players struggled with \"drink, debt or abandoned wives\". The two gradually turned around the club's fortunes, and started by painting Victoria Park. Taylor had little chance to show his skills in the transfer market as the club only had \u00a37,500 to spend, \u00a34,000 of which went on centre-half Johnny Gill. Other signings included two of Taylor's former players at Burton, defender Tony Parry and goalkeeper Les Green; Parry would go on to win the club's Player of the Year award. The pair went on to lead the club to an eighth-place finish in the Fourth Division in 1966\u201367 after replacing most of the playing staff, an improvement on 1965\u201366 when the pair had only managed an 18th-place finish. Clough had initially wanted to quit the club numerous times due to interference from chairman Ernest Ord, but Taylor insisted that they stay as they could not walk out on their first job in management. After Ord resigned as chairman Clough wanted to remain at Hartlepools, but Taylor persuaded him to take the offer to manage Derby."]}, {"page": "2009 in association football", "response": ["*23 November \u2013 Tony Parry (64), English defender"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 in English football", "response": ["*23 November 2009 \u2013 Tony Parry, 64, former central defender who spent the majority of his nine-year professional career with Hartlepool United, and also had a brief spell with Derby County before dropping down to non-league football.Tributes paid to Pools promotion legend , Peterlee Mail.
