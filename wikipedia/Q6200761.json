He played reserve-team football for his first few months, until, in February 1911, Bradford City completed his transfer, for a fee of \u00a360, and he became eligible for the first team. With both regular full backs injured, Gildea came into a reshuffled defence to face Blackburn Rovers at Valley Parade on 28 February. City won 1\u20130, the Leeds Mercury reporter noted him as \"a centre-half of undoubted ability\", and he kept his place for the next two matches, the second of which was the FA Cup quarter-final against Burnley. City opened the scoring in the first half, and despite an injury to Gildea that forced him to play on the wing for half the match, they retained their lead. He returned to fitness in time for the semi-final, a 3\u20130 win against Blackburn Rovers in which he and Jimmy McDonald \"stuck grimly\" to England international forward Jock Simpson \"and generally prevented him from becoming dangerous.\" The Scottish Referee newspaper described his rise as \"of a meteoric order\", having \"developed so much that there are now few better men in the position.\""]}, {"page": "1907\u201308 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"|Jimmy McDonald"]}, {"page": "James Alexander McDonald", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy McDonald (footballer, born 1883)"]}]}}
