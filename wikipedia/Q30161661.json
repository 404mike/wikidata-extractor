He works as a master thief, assassin and a high performance driver. He was Mr. Nobody's subordinate but went rogue prior to the series. It is revealed that Dom banished Jakob from the family after he accused him of causing their father's death, which was due to Jakob leaving an oil patch on the racetrack where their father ultimately died. Soon after, Jakob is taken in by Buddy, one of the member of their father's pit crew. Due to this, Jakob holds a personal grudge against Dom, who he claims to have \"turned his back\" on him, despite Dom's \"never turn your back on family\" motto, therefore wanting him to either \"live under his shadow\" or get killed. Because of this reason, he and his personal associate Otto capture the cyber-terrorist Cipher (although Jakob refuses to work with her as he \"doesn't work for the competition\") and force her to give them the remaining pieces to Project Aries, a device that can hack into any computer weapons system. Towards the end of F9, however, Otto double-crosses Jakob and begins to work with Cipher, leading the brothers to reconcile and work together in the movie's final battle to defeat Cipher, even though she escapes once more. At the end of the film, Dom finally forgives Jakob for his role in their father's death by helping him escape his enemies by giving him the keys to his Dodge Charger, similar to what Brian O'Conner did with Dom in the first film.
