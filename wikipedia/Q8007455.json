He is best known as a former member of the cult English rock band Cardiacs, whom he played with for nine years between 1983 and 1992. He has also been a member of The Sea Nymphs, North Sea Radio Orchestra, Nervous, Wood, Lake of Puppies and The Grown-Ups, as well as pursuing a career as a solo artist. He is a distant cousin of the English singer-songwriter Nick Drake.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiacs", "response": ["In the late 1970s, Cardiacs established itself playing gigs in Surrey and London over three years from 1977, initially called the Filth and later Cardiac Arrest. They released three demo albums from 1980 to 1984. After creating their label Alphabet Business Concern in 1984, Cardiacs found unexpected mainstream success with \"Is This the Life?\", the re-recorded single from their debut studio album A Little Man and a House and the Whole World Window (1988). Their line-up changed throughout this time, with their best-known lasting through On Land and in the Sea (1989) until Heaven Born and Ever Bright (1992) comprising Tim Smith (guitar, lead vocals), Jim Smith (bass guitar, vocals), William D. Drake (keyboards, vocals), Sarah Smith (saxophone, vocals), Dominic Luckman (drums) and Tim Quy (marimba, percussion, synthesiser).", "In mid-1983 Mark Cawthra left the band, to be replaced on keyboards by William D. Drake. Tim Smith had previously met Drake in 1982 at the debut performance of Drake's band Honour Our Trumpet (who promptly invited him to join as bass guitarist.) Following Cawthra's departure, Smith returned Drake's favour by inviting him to join Cardiacs. Drake played his first concert with the band on 31 August 1983. Later in the year, Cardiacs added Marguerite Johnston (alto saxophone) and Graham Simmonds (guitar), and for about a year the band worked as an octet. Both Johnston and Simmonds left during the following summer (in July and August respectively), although Simmonds stayed on as Cardiacs' sound engineer.", "By autumn 1984, the band lineup had settled as the sextet generally referred to as \"the classic line-up\" \u2013 Tim Smith (lead vocals and guitar), Jim Smith (bass and vocals), William D. Drake (keyboards and vocals), Sarah Smith (saxophones and vocals), Tim Quy (percussion and bass synth) and Dominic Luckman (drums).", "A Cardiacs spin-off project \u2013 Mr and Mrs Smith and Mr Drake \u2013 emerged in 1984. As the name suggests, this featured Tim and Sarah Smith plus William D. Drake and consisted of a quieter, more acoustically-orientated take on Cardiacs' music. The project released a self-titled cassette album which was only available via the Cardiacs fan club. Later on, the project would be renamed the Sea Nymphs.", "The band was quiet for the first four months of 1991, during which time two more members departed. William D. Drake played his final concert with the band on 2 May at The Venue in New Cross (going on to join the band Nervous and, in 2001, embarking on a long-delayed solo career). Christian Hayes (had joined up-and-coming indie-psychedelic band Levitation) played his own final gig as a Cardiac in Oxford on 16 May: although Cardiacs and Levitation were friendly with each other and had even toured together, Hayes had finally found it impossible to balance the demands of both bands. Both Hayes and Drake would continue to be associated with Cardiacs, and would occasionally guest with the band at selected live concerts many years later.", "The next two years saw no new music from Cardiacs and reduced live activity. However, there were three more London concerts in 1998 \u2013 at one of these (the Garage concert on 4 December) the band was joined for an encore by William D. Drake. During the same year Cardiacs also played several performances in Germany and the Netherlands, and made appearances in Brighton and at a festival in St Austell in Cornwall. 1998 also saw renewed activity by the Sea Nymphs, with the \"Appealing To Venus\" single reissued with extra tracks by Org Records, and a rare concert at the Camden Falcon in north London.", "At the start of 1999, Cardiacs played three nights in a row at the Camden Falcon, London between 29 and 31 January: on the final date, Sarah Smith and William D. Drake joined in for the encore. On 20 and 21 March the band played two concerts at the Garage with support from Dark Star (a new band featuring ex-Cardiac Christian Hayes) and Camp Blackfoot. Cardiacs toured the UK in June 1999 to support the release of their new album, Guns, described by some of the music press as being their most accessible album to date. The band performed another radio session on 13 June for \"Inside Tracks\" (on BBC Choice digital radio). Three more concerts followed in October.", "Counterbalancing the lack of tours, the band set up an annual tradition of one-off large-scale London concerts (the first of which took place on 11 November 2000 and the last in 2007). These usually took place in November at the London Astoria, and soon became a kind of Cardiacs family gathering in which the band was joined by various guests including former members and newer Cardiacs-inspired supported bands. During these concerts, Sarah Smith, William D. Drake, Christian Hayes and Dominic Luckman all appeared onstage with the band on various occasions, as did the Consultant and Miss Swift. Support bands were always musicians with a professed Cardiacs connection or influence, and included Oceansize, the Monsoon Bassoon, the Scaramanga Six, Stars in Battledress and Jon Poole's hard-rock band GodDamnWhores.", "In December 2010, two tribute CDs, Leader of the Starry Skies: A Tribute To Tim Smith, Songbook 1 and its limited edition companion Leader of the Starry Skies - A Loyal Companion, were compiled by former Cardiac Christian Hayes and former Spratleys Japs singer Jo Spratley. These were released on Kavus Torabi's record label Believers Roast, with all proceeds going directly to the continuing care of Tim Smith. The albums featured cover versions of Smith-penned material (originally for Cardiacs, the Sea Nymphs, Spratleys Japs and Smith's solo album OceanLandWorld) by musicians including the Magic Numbers, Steven Wilson, Oceansize, Robert White/Andy Partridge, Sidi Bou Said and North Sea Radio Orchestra as well as former Cardiacs including Hayes himself (as Mikrokosmos), Torabi (as Knifeworld), William D.

They featured Cardiacs-related groups in performance such as Knifeworld, William D. Drake, and Redbus Noface. Several smaller benefit concerts were held from time to time in this period and moving forward.", "In December 2016 Tim, Sarah, and William D. Drake were interviewed for Prog magazine, detailing more of Tim's current condition, the sessions behind On the Dry Land's creation and completion and confirming \"at least an album's worth\" of Sea Nymphs material that is yet to be finished.

The album was initially released on Rough Trade instead of the band's own label Alphabet Business Concern, who usually release the band's albums.

The album was recorded and mixed at The Slaughterhouse, Yorkshire, between Summer and Autumn 1988, except \"Horse Head\" and \"The Safety Bowl\", which the liner notes describe as being recorded \"in the hand\" and \"in the bush\" respectively. It was the group's final album with the \"classic\" six-piece line-up, as William D. Drake, Tim Quy and Sarah Smith left the group after its release, leaving drummer Dominic Luckman with Tim Smith, the group's guitarist, vocalist and leader, and Jim Smith.

It was just great fun, lots of exploring and experimenting.\" The record was produced by Tim Smith and engineered by Graham Simmonds and Roger Tebbutt.", "Many Cardiacs fans consider On Land and in the Sea be the band's best album. According to Sean Kitching of The Quietus, fans are split between those who consider On Land and in the Sea the band's best recorded work, and those who consider Sing to God (1996) instead, noting that the choice perhaps depends \"on the era of the individual's initial fascination as well as their breadth of preferred musical palette.\" Future Cardiacs guitarist Kavus Torabi said discovering the album was \"like a clarion call to haul my lazy refusenik butt from a twilight existence in the South West of this England all the way over to London and get on board with the rigmarole of making proper far out music.\" In a list for The Quietus, he named it one of his favourite albums, saying \"when this came out I genuinely thought they were going to be the new Beatles,\" adding that \"it's an absolutely perfect album. It exists completely in its own dimension. It's everything you want from music.\" Fellow future member Jon Poole said that, \"as a fan\", it's his favourite Cardiacs album, adding that it \"[b]rings back great memories of following the band around in a tiny car with [future Cardiacs drummer] Bob Leith.\" William D.

The addition of keyboardist William D. Drake in the lineup also revamped the Cardiacs sound, along with Smith taking over vocals after Mark Cawthra left in 1983. Smith's war-related lyrics in songs such as \"Hope Day\" were expanded upon in \"Loosefish Scapegrace\", a song that provided an anthemic theme to introduce the new album to fans, as well as \"Victory Egg\" (originally titled \"Victory\"), a song about the First World War. Smith and Drake co-wrote the songs \"I'm Eating in Bed\" and the album closer \"The Whole World Window\". Smith wrote the album's interlude in his youth, when he was about 13 years old.
