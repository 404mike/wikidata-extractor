He failed to make an appearance for the club during their first season in the League. Ashworth eventually made his debut on 14 September 1889, scoring Burnley's goal in the 1\u20132 defeat away at Everton. It was then almost four months before he played again for the Clarets, when he was named in the line-up for the 1\u20133 defeat to Stoke on 11 January 1890. Despite scoring again, Ashworth never made another appearance for Burnley and left the club at the end of the 1889\u201390 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Ashworth", "response": ["John Ashworth may refer to:", "*John Ashworth (cricketer) (1850\u20131901), English cricketer", "*John Ashworth (footballer), English professional footballer", "*John Ashworth (judge) (1906\u20131975), England judge and barrister", "*John Ashworth (preacher) (1813\u20131875), English preacher, manufacturer, and author", "*John Ashworth (rugby union) (born 1949), New Zealand rugby union player", "*John Ashworth (biologist) (born 1938), former vice-chancellor of the University of Salford and former director of the LSE", "*John Ashworth (priest), Dean of Trinidad"]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|John Ashworth"]}]}}
