When he joined Glamorgan in 1980 he became the first cricketer to represent four English first-class counties.\nAllan Jones was educated at St John's College, Horsham. A tall right-arm fast-medium bowler and a tail-end right-handed batsman, he represented Sussex (1966-1969), Somerset (1970-1975; Cap 1972), Northern Transvaal (1972/1973), Orange Free State (1976/1977), Middlesex (1976-1979; Cap 1976) and Glamorgan (1980-1981).\nIn 214 first-class matches, he scored 799 runs (average 5.39, with a personal best of 33 for Middlesex versus Kent at Canterbury in 1978) and took 549 wickets (at an average 28.07, with a personal best of 9 for 51 for Somerset versus Sussex at Hove in 1972). He also took three wickets in four balls for Somerset versus Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in 1972 and became the first Middlesex bowler to take a hat-trick in limited overs cricket.\nHe was appointed to the English First-Class Umpires list in 1985 and remained until 2008, when he joined the Indian Cricket League. He stood in one One Day International in 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 9", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Allan Jones, English cricketer and umpire"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Allan Jones (1970\u20131975) 118 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Allan Jones", "response": ["Allan Jones may refer to:", "*Allan Jones (actor) (1907\u20131992), American actor and singer, and the father of singer Jack Jones", "*Allan Jones (cricketer) (born 1947), English cricket umpire and former cricketer", "*Allan Jones (editor) (born 1951/52), British music journalist", "*Allan Jones (engineer), British engineer, pioneer work on Combined Heat & Power systems", "*Allan Jones (footballer, born 1940) (1940\u20131993), Welsh footballer who played as a defender", "*Allan Jones (football coach), former New Zealand national football team manager", "*Allan Jones (businessman) (born 1952), founder of Check Into Cash"]}, {"page": "Chalkwell Park", "response": ["| Allan Jones (6/34 for Somerset against Essex) in 1971"]}, {"page": "Allan Arthur Jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Allan Jones (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Hallam Moseley", "response": ["Touring England at the age of 21 with a team from his native Barbados, Moseley caught the eye of Bill Andrews, and with the recommendation of Sir Garry Sobers, he arrived in Taunton within a year.  However, qualification problems were to delay his debut for Somerset until the fourth match of the 1971 John Player League.  He provided good support for Allan Jones and Tom Cartwright, taking 19 one-day wickets at 20.26 in his first season.  A particularly strong one-day bowler, Moseley led Somerset in wickets in the John Player League in 1973, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980 and 1982, never quite showing the consistency needed to break into a West Indies squad already full of pacy seam bowlers."]}, {"page": "John Lyon (cricketer)", "response": ["After the 1976 season, Engineer went into business, and though Lancashire paid him a retainer, the county did not call on him to play ever again. Lyon became the regular wicket-keeper for the next three seasons, though he appears never to have been entirely sure of his place: the county recruited as well Chris Scott, highly thought of as a wicket-keeper but a poor batsman. The threat to Lyon came at the end of his first regular season: \"Lyon performed creditably and played an occasional good innings,\" wrote Wisden, \"but towards the end of the season his form suffered... and for the last three Championship matches Lancashire introduced the 18-year-old Scott and were quite impressed with the youngster's form and promise.\" Lyon's own batting was disappointing with a top score of only 34 and an average of less than 10 runs per innings, and his 41 dismissals put him 12th on the list of wicket-keepers in the English game for the 1977 season. He did, however, make his one representative appearance in the 1977 season, playing for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the early-season match with the Australian team that often provided clues to Test match selection. Nine of the MCC team did subsequently play for England but Lyon, who took four catches in the match, was one of two \u2013 the other was Allan Jones \u2013 who didn't."]}]}}
