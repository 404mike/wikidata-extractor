These former members include Patricia Morrison, who claimed she had been paid an average of \u00a3300 per month; and Wayne Hussey, with whom Eldritch had a personal feud which contributed to heavy criticism of both by the music press during the 1980s.

At the end of the year, through CBS Records, who were interested in signing the band, he was replaced by former Dead or Alive member Wayne Hussey. The new band line-up played its debut concert on 7 April 1984, which featured the newly written songs \"Body and Soul\", \"Train\" and \"Walk Away\". The gig was followed by a short American tour until 16 April. After returning to the UK, Eldritch wrote a new song called \"Wide Receiver\", which was inspired by a term in American Football and which he recorded on his own at home as a demo. The rudimentary song wasn't used in the end, but Eldritch's solo demo recording appeared in early 1992 on a bootleg album.", "On \"Nine While Nine\", which, according to Marx, was \"recorded at the same time\" and \"had the working title 'Child of Light\", Gary Marx sang a guide vocal which he reused later for the Ghost Dance song \"A Deeper Blue\". The title of this song is derived from Yorkshire dialect where \"while\" is used to mean \"until\". \"Black Planet\" exists in the form of an early version with a Wayne Hussey lyric which he later used for the Mission songs \"Dance on Glass\" and \"Naked and Savage\". Additional songs which were left unused were the later Mission song \"Garden of Delight\" and later Ghost Dance song \"Yesterday Again\". Eldritch later sang his own version of \"Garden of Delight\" which remained unused as well: \"There are a few bootlegs in existence of me trying to sing Wayne's words, and you can hear that I'm not convinced by them. I can't breathe any meaning into them.\"Andrew Eldritch TV interview (ZTV, Sweden 1993) \"The guy didn't have a clue \u2013 he'd just string buzz words together.\"", "Recordings were delayed, to the frustration of the band as Eldritch was still working on lyrics. Gary Marx: \"He'd got far too caught up in the business and had lost his edge as a writer. We wasted weeks at a time in the studio, waiting for him to come up with a handful of lyrics. It was very painful and very expensive.\" A notable exception was \"Marian\". Eldritch, inspired by Gary Marx's original lyrics to \"First and Last and Always\", wrote new words to a Wayne Hussey composition which contained a few passages sung in German. \"'Marian' is a very special song; it's not like any of the other songs. I wrote it in ten minutes, usually the lyrics take me up to half a year.\" The vocal takes proved to be time-consumingly elaborate. Marx said, \"After each session Andy would say, 'But is it epic?', and we'd go, 'Yeah Andy, it's great!' And he'd go back and do it again. Andy's a complete perfectionist.\" He added, \"We could write and record a double album in the time it took him to get the headphone mix to his liking.\"", "The band then returned to Genetic Studios to put the finishing touches on the album. It was possibly at these sessions that the band recorded a studio version of the Bob Dylan song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\"; an indication of the band's black humour. Studio versions of the two later Mission songs, \"Serpents Kiss\" and \"Wake\", exist. Wayne Hussey: \"Both of these songs were actually first recorded during the sessions for [First and Last and Always], but weren't completed at that time.\" It's not clear whether these two songs were recorded at Strawberry or at Genetic Studios. On 22 September 1984, the band made an appearance at a festival in York and then went on the Black October tour through the UK and Europe from 4 October till 18 November 1984, which was originally set up to coincide with the release of the album. To coincide with the tour, a first single off the album was released on 8 October 1984, \"Walk Away\", which included a limited edition flexidisc featuring an \"Amphetamix\" of the song \"Train\". With the release schedule disrupted and the album postponed to the next year, the record company unsuccessfully requested to postpone \"Walk Away\" too. \"Walk Away\", like its predecessor, failed to reach the UK top 40, reaching No. 45.", "On 8 March 1985, the single \"No Time to Cry\" was released, reached No. 63 on the UK chart. To coincide with the album release, a UK tour began on 9 March. On 11 March, WEA Records Ltd. released the album in the UK to positive press reactions. On 1 April, Marx played his last concert with The Sisters of Mercy, followed by a TV appearance the day after, during which the band played live in the studio versions of \"First and Last and Always\" and \"Marian\". The remaining trio, with Wayne Hussey shouldering all guitar parts, started another tour through Europe and the US on 12 April, which continued till 7 June. A second TV appearance for German TV show , during which the band mimed to \"No Time to Cry\", was broadcast on 15 April 1985. The Sisters of Mercy played their final concert as planned on 18 June 1985 at the Royal Albert Hall. Gary Marx, who was announced to take part, didn't show up.
