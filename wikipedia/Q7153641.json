This rose \"from little more than 2 million in 1485,\u00a0... [to] about 2.8 million by the end of Henry VII's reign (1509)\". The population was growing faster than the economy's ability to provide employment opportunities. The problem was made worse because during the English Reformation, Henry VIII severed the ecclesiastical governance of his kingdoms of England and Ireland and made himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. This involved the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England and Wales: the assets of hundreds of rich religious institutions, including their great estates, were taken by the Crown. This had a devastating impact on poor relief. According to the historian Paul Slack, prior to the Dissolution \"it has been estimated that monasteries alone provided 6,500 pounds a year in alms before 1537 []; and that sum was not made good by private benefactions until after 1580.\" In addition to the closing of the monasteries, most hospitals (which in the 16th century were generally almshouses rather than medical institutions) were also closed, as they \"had come to be seen as special types of religious houses\". This left many of the elderly and sick without accommodation or care. In 1531, the Vagabonds and Beggars Act was revised, and a new Act was passed by parliament which did make some provision for the different classes of the poor. The sick, the elderly, and the disabled were to be issued with licences to beg. But those who were out of work and in search of employment were still not spared punishment. Throughout the 16th century, a fear of social unrest was the primary motive for much legislation that was passed by parliament."]}, {"page": "Bradford Grammar School", "response": ["*Paul Slack (born 1943), historian"]}, {"page": "Ford Lectures", "response": ["* 1994\u201395 Paul Slack, From Reformation to improvement: public welfare in early modern England "]}, {"page": "Peter Clark (historian)", "response": ["* Editor (with Paul Slack), Crisis and Order in English Towns (Routledge, 1972, 2006)"]}, {"page": "Gerald Aylmer", "response": ["In 1993 Aylmer was honoured with a festschrift edited by his long-time colleagues John Morrill and Paul Slack and his former doctoral student Daniel Woolf.", "Aylmer's publications up to 1990 are listed in his Festschrift.William Sheils, 'Select Bibliography', in John Morrill, Paul Slack and Daniel Woolf, eds, Public Duty and Private Conscience in Seventeenth-Century England: Essays Presented to G.
