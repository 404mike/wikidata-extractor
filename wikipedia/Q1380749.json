Two minutes later, Jason Koumas rounded three defenders and with only Bywater to beat in the Derby goal, Tyrone Mears made the tackle; penalty appeals from West Bromwich Albion were ignored by the referee Poll.  On 18 minutes, Matt Oakley passed to Craig Fagan who advanced into the penalty area but struck his shot wide.  Three minutes later, a free kick from West Brom deflected off the Derby wall and had to be gathered by Bywater.  The first yellow card of the afternoon was shown in the 31st minute to Peschisolido after a foul on Paul Robinson. In the 34th minute, Derby's Seth Johnson chipped the ball forwards, Howard chested it into Jay McEveley's path, but his low shot was saved.  Sam Sodje was then booked for a foul on Johnson before Paul McShane was shown a yellow card for a high foot on Howard.

The only goal of the second half, from Michael Essien, gave Chelsea all three points. The Blues' first home game of the season was against Sunderland who had beaten the Blues to the Championship title the previous season. An own goal from Paul McShane was enough to give the Blues the lead at half time, but Sunderland fought back with a goal from Michael Chopra before a Garry O'Connor goal seemed to have given Blues their first win of the season. However, a late Stern John goal was enough to earn Sunderland a point. West Ham United were the next team to visit St Andrew's, where a Mark Noble penalty was the only goal of the game that gave the London club all three points.

With midfielder James Bailey injured in the week prior to the match, an ankle injury which ruled him out for three months. Derby unsuccessfully tried to sign former-Captain Matt Oakley on loan from Leicester City to bolster the midfield. The already contentious fixture saw tensions heightened by the news that Nathan Tyson, who had injured himself in pre-season following his move to Derby from Forest, was finally available for selection for the Rams. In the event of the match, Frank Fielding was sent off after just 66 seconds after bundling over Forest striker Ishmael Miller giving Adam Legzdins to make his first appearance for the club, with his first action being to pick Andy Reid's penalty out of the back of the net. However, Jamie Ward's 29th-minute equaliser, a mazy run past three Forest defenders before he beat Lee Camp at his near post from the byline, saw the ten-man Derby side level at half-time. The second half saw Nathan Tyson come on for his Derby debut, but it was 19-year-old academy graduate Jeff Hendrick, who like Mark O'Brien had broken into the first team after impressive performances and was named in the Championship Team of the Week on the back of his performance, who grabbed the headlines when he scored midway into the second half with his first professional goal and claimed Derby's third win at the City Ground in five attempts. The victory was followed with four points from the next two home games - a 3\u20130 thumping of Millwall which saw John Brayford, Ben Davies and Jeff Hendrick named in the Championship's 'Team of the Week' and a 1\u20131 draw with Barnsley - to take them into the automatic promotion spots. The results came in midst of discussion over Clough's contract - which was due to expire at the end of the season, with Forest allegedly interested in securing their former-player's services."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Exeter City F.C. season", "response": ["|MF || ||12 ||Matt Oakley || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0", "| Matt Oakley"]}, {"page": "Matthew Oakley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Matt Oakley"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["|Matt Oakley"]}]}}
