He is the son of former footballer Arthur Fraser Mann", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Mann", "response": ["Mann was born in Burntisland, Scotland and began his playing career at Heart of Midlothian. He played for Hearts in the 1968 Scottish Cup Final, although he ended up on the losing side as Dunfermline won 3\u20131. He then moved to England, where he represented Manchester City. He was signed by Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison for a then club record of \u00a365,000. In common with Dennis Bergkamp, he had a fear of flying and so was unable to take part in City's European escapades. He failed to break into the Cup winning side and moved on after a season to Blackpool. He then moved to Notts County, Shrewsbury Town, Mansfield Town, Boston United (whom he also managed), Kettering Town and Telford United. He was Alan Buckley's assistant manager at Grimsby Town and West Bromwich Albion, and had a spell as caretaker-manager at Albion early in 1997 following Buckley's dismissal. He is the father of former Hull City stalwart Neil Mann. Mann died on 4 February 1999 in an industrial accident at a Birmingham factory."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["*Youth Recruitment Officer: Neil Mann"]}, {"page": "Neil Mann", "response": ["Neil Mann may refer to:", "*Neil Mann (Australian footballer) (1924\u20132013), Australian rules footballer", "*Neil Mann (English footballer) (born 1972), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["*Youth Recruitment Officer: Neil Mann"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Neil Mann"]}, {"page": "Danny Emerton", "response": ["Born in Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, Emerton began his footballing career at Hull City's Academy at the age of 12.
