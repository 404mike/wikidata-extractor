When she was three years old, her family's ostrich farm failed, and they moved into Cape Town itself.  There, she attended the Seminary of Good Hope, while being educated in Jewish culture and faith by her father.  She attended the University of Cape Town for a year, then her family migrated to Palestine, the first South African Jews to do so.  However, there was no opportunity for her to study in Palestine, so she moved to England, where she attended the University of Liverpool for a further year, and then the London School of Economics (LSE).In London, she met Elchon Hinden, a medical graduate, and the two married in February 1933.  Although they briefly moved back to Palestine, they soon returned to London so Elchon could undertake further study, and the couple became active in the Independent Labour Party.  Rita also continued to study, working on a doctorate at the LSE under David Horowitz.  The couple moved to Palestine again in 1935, where they became active in the Labour Zionist movement, but became disillusioned with the rising nationalism and also Elchon's difficulties in finding suitable employment.  In 1938, they finally settled in England, and gradually became agnostic, although they remained involved in a variety of Jewish organisations.Rita joined the Labour Party and the Fabian Society.  She obtained her doctorate in 1939 and, on the advice of R. R. Kuczynski, she founded the Fabian Colonial Bureau to research and campaign on anti-colonialism.  She became the bureau's first secretary, and worked closely with Arthur Creech Jones, its first chair.  They produced numerous pamphlets, and Hinden's own book, Plan for Africa.  Although she stood down as secretary in 1950, she continued to write for it, while also serving on a variety of government committees.  She became the secretary of the Socialist Union , and editor of Socialist Commentary, bodies associated with the Labour Party and particularly with Hugh Gaitskell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "H. N.

He was chairman of the Bureau from 1945 to 1950. He also wrote a regular column for the monthly magazine Socialist Commentary, edited by Hinden. In 1947 he and Winifred divorced, and the following year he married Margaret Victoria McWilliams, a widow with whom he had been having an affair since the early 1930s. He scaled back his political activities from the 1950s due to failing health. He died on bronchopneumonia at home in Hendon, London, on 2 March 1962 aged 77. He had no children."]}, {"page": "Charles Matinga", "response": ["Dr. Hastings Banda, who had a practice in London at the time, was a supporter of Congress. Banda wrote to Matinga in March 1945 saying that he would support the Congress in England by giving lectures and talking to influential people whom he knew such as Sir Arthur Creech Jones and Rita Hinden. He asked that Matinga keep him informed of events in Nyasaland so they could work together to the common goal. However, according to Banda, Matinga was determined to go his own way and even refused an offer by Banda to pay for a permanent organizer for the Congress. Possible Matinga saw Banda as a potential rival."]}, {"page": "Mary Saran", "response": ["In Britain she worked with in the Socialist Vanguard Group (SVG), which was effectively the British branch of the ISK.   In 1941 she became editor of the group's monthly publication, retaining the editorship (latterly jointly with Rita Hinden) until 1955.  During the 1930s she had obtained British citizenship, in 1935/36 briefly marrying a fellow socialist, Allen Flanders, in support of her citizenship application.   War ended in defeat for the Nazi r\u00e9gime in May 1945.   Many of the socialist refugees from Naziism, who had lived in England since the 1930s now returned to Germany, including Minna Specht with whom Saran had at times worked closely in London.    Mary Saran stayed on in England, working as a freelance journalist, contributing particularly (but not exclusively) to socialist and women's publications.   Till 1947 she was the editor for \"Europe speaks\" in succession to Willi Eichler who had also returned to Germany.   She also worked with the UNESCO, focusing on women's issues.   She continued to play an active part in British Labour Party politics and in adult education.   From 1974 she taught in a London school.   Her memoir appeared in 1976 under the title \"Never give up\".   1976 was also the year in which she died.   Her English language memoir was translated by her friend, the historian Susanne Miller, and published privately in Germany under the title \"Gib niemals auf. Erinnerungen\" in 1979."]}, {"page": "Rita Gesundheit", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rita Hinden"]}, {"page": "Socialist Vanguard Group", "response": ["Rita Hinden, secretary of the Fabian Colonial Bureau, joined the group in 1947, despite opposing its positions on democracy and vegetarianism.  The group leadership felt this was a great success and, in the hope of gaining even more influence among Labour Party officials, it changed the organisation's formal purpose to supporting the Labour government.  It also separated Socialist Commentary from the group, it thereafter being published by the International Publishing Company.  This enabled Phillips to write a letter to Labour groups, recommending that they purchase the newspaper, and boosted its circulation to 4,000 an issue, with contributors including Herbert Morrison, Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan and Denis Healey.  However, many members of the group questioned these changes, and it became apparent that it could not continue as it was."]}, {"page": "Margaret Wrong", "response": ["A year after Wrong's death, the Margaret Wrong Prize for African Literature was established in her memory.
