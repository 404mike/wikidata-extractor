But having become quite bored with what he was playing on it, he moved for his next album to the piano. For a year he created improvisations, charting a deeply personal journey through significant life experiences and environments. These were then given to pianist Kevin Pollard to interpret and expand, with Clemo then adding additional guitar pieces to shape the compositions. With the basic structure laid out, he then invited 14 additional musicians \u2013 one at a time \u2013 to \"blindly\" add their response on top, including: Oren Marshall (tuba); B. J. Cole (pedal steel guitar); Byron Wallen (trumpet and flugelhorn); Emily Burridge (cello); with Thomas Bloch (Radiohead, Damon Albarn) contributing ethereal tones on three instruments (glass harmonica, crystal baschet and ondes martenot). Clemo then heavily edited and shaped their contributions. The album was the first on which Clemo added his own voice, using multi-layering to create harmonies. He finally added additional recorded sounds from places which have great significance to him, including: the river and woods at the end of his childhood garden; his first school; Aberdeen railway station; Redwood National Park in northern California; and Plum Village Zen Buddhist monastery in France. As with The Rooms, most of the sessions were recorded by Phill Brown, who Clemo sees as crucial in both building powerful creative environments, and capturing a high level of sonic detail in the sessions. The end result, Mesmer, was well reviewed by both the music and mainstream press, described as a form of contemporary chamber music with \"improvisation, multi-level musical dialogue and sound design at its core.\"", "With contributions from 21 musicians including Arve Henriksen (trumpet), Evi Vine (voice), Byron Wallen (trumpet, flugelhorn), Oren Marshall (tuba), Thomas Bloch (glass harmonica, Ondes Martenot), Emily Burridge and Peter Gregson (cellos), Dream Maps was released on 9 September 2016 with a live launch with an 8-piece band including Arve Henriksen and Evi Vine at Kings Place, London, UK on 14 September.
