By 1897, he was professionally known as Roy Redgrave apparently in the belief that he was descended from Rob Roy. The Redgrave family originated in the Northamptonshire village of Crick. Redgrave also assumed the middle name \"Elsworthy\" from his mother, and his sister took the stage name Dolly Elsworthy. Redgrave was the eldest of five siblings including, Zoe Adelina \"Dolly\" Elsworthy (b. 1876), Cornelius (b. 1878), Christopher (b. 1879) and Harriet (b. 1880).", "His first wife was actress Ellen Maud Pratt, the daughter of prosperous Devon farmer, John Dew Pratt of Buckland Monachorum. Her stage name was Judith Kyrle. They were married in Littleham-cum-Exmouth, Devon on 1 September 1894. Their careers reached a high point at their joint debut at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton in April 1900 with Roy billed as \"The Dramatic Cock o' the North\". They had three children, John Kyrle born in 1895, Robin Roy (father of Major-General Sir Roy Redgrave) born in 1897 and Nellie Maud born in 1898.", "At some point after initial Australian theatre work, Redgrave left for England alone. According to the \"History of Australian Theatre\" archives, American actress Minnie Tittell Brune made her first appearance in Australia on 21 September 1904 at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney in the play Sunday, supported by Roy Redgrave. Roy toured with her on the J.C. Williamson circuit. According to Corin Redgrave, Ellen (Judith) pursued Roy to Australia, arriving in time to pay his unsettled hotel bills, but she was unable to persuade him to return home with her to his family. Ellen remarried Frederick John Nettlefold, a respectable landed gentleman, in Brighton, England in 1907.", "Redgrave remained in Australia until his death sometime in the 1920s, but exactly where he lived and when he died remained a mystery to his family in Britain until his granddaughter Lynn Redgrave visited Sydney with her then husband John Clark, and vowed to find him. Their search ended at the Sydney Opera House library, where, as she recounts in her play Shakespeare for My Father (page 48), they came up with Redgrave's obituary, learning that he had died on 25 May 1922, and was buried at South Head Cemetery. There they learned that he had been put in an unmarked grave by somebody called Minnie, who paid 15 shillings. (The idea that it may have been the religious Minnie Tittell Brune feeling sorry for him is enticing. More probably it was Minnie Hider, Esther's friend and confidante, who brought Victor up). They found the spot, and arranged for a headstone, asked his son Michael what it should say, and he said to put, simply, \"Roy Redgrave, Actor\". It was later discovered that Redgrave married Irish widow Mary Leresche in 1916. His marriage certificate makes reference to his previous marriage to Ellen (Judith) but not to any subsequent marriage to Daisy (Margaret Scudamore). Mary died in 1948."]}, {"page": "George Iacobescu", "response": ["On 31 December 2011, he was knighted for services to charity, community and the financial services industry. Although he is the third Romanian-born person to be knighted (after Elie Wiesel who received an honorary knighthood, and British Army general Roy Redgrave whose mother was Romanian and who was born in Bucharest), he was the first to receive a full British knighthood having been born and educated in Romania and later becoming a British citizen. He was therefore feted in Romania as the \"first\" Romanian to be knighted.
