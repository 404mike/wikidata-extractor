He was the great grandson of the Liberal prime minister William Ewart Gladstone, and brother of Sir William Gladstone, 7th Baronet. He grew up at Hawarden Castle in Wales, and attended Eton College, where his father, Charles Gladstone, was a housemaster. He served in the Palestine Police in 1946, towards the end of the British Mandate of Palestine. From 1949 to 1952 he studied biology at Christ Church, Oxford, and rowed for Oxford in the 1952 Boat Race. He went on to teach biology at Shrewsbury School until 1971, when he joined Sir Peter Scott's Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. Gladstone developed the trust's wildfowl reserve at Martin Mere in Lancashire. In the 1970s he took over the management of Fasque House, a family property in Aberdeenshire. In 1998 he journeyed to Tibet in an unsuccessful search for the pink-headed duck. He was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Gladstone died of a heart attack at the age of 71.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fasque House", "response": ["Fasque House remained a working home until 1932, when Lady Mary, who had survived her brother John by six years, passed on. At this point, Fasque House became disused, with much of the furniture covered with sheets, and rooms locked up for decades. The estate itself operated as before, but the main house was empty, although it remained \"immaculately well preserved\". Eventually, the Baronetcy passed through various family lines to end up with the 7th Baronet, Sir William Gladstone, great-grandson of the prime minister, and a former Chief Scout. In 1978, Sir William's younger brother, the naturalist Peter Gladstone, redecorated Fasque, apparently whitewashing almost every wall surface himself, and opened it to the public for the first time in September of that year, partly capitalising on the then-current popularity of the TV show Upstairs Downstairs.  Fasque House remained open to summer visitors for over two decades, with the house's east wing almost entirely open to the public, and the west wing providing a home for Peter's family.  A large auction of items from the house gained much publicity when it was held in the grounds in 1997. Peter died in 2000, with the estate now being run by Charles Gladstone, son of Sir William, the 7th Baronet. In 2003, the house was closed to the public, and since then specially arranged coach parties and wedding services have also been discontinued."]}, {"page": "Gladstone, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Gladstone"]}]}}
