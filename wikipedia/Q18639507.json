He then returned to his home town where he turned professional with York City. He played six league matches for each club. In 1934, he joined another Third Division club, Hartlepools United, where he established himself as the regular selection at outside-left and scored at better than a goal every two games in his first season. Less prolific in his second year, he was sold to Chesterfield, newly promoted to the Second Division for 1936\u201337. Again, he was first choice on the left wing and productive in front of goal during his first season, less so in the next, in which he helped the team reach the fifth round of the 1937\u201338 FA Cup. In 1938\u201339, he fell out of favour, and requested a transfer. He joined Queens Park Rangers, but his career was cut short by the outbreak of war.\nDuring the Second World War, Bonass served in the Metropolitan Police's War Reserve and then as a wireless operator in the Royal Air Force. He was killed in October 1945, together with the rest of the crew and a civilian on the ground, when his Short Stirling bomber crashed on a training flight.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tockwith", "response": ["At 1.34am on Tuesday 9 October 1945, a Stirling bomber which was about to land on RAF Marston Moor crashed in the main street of Tockwith, killing the village postmaster and the six crew members as well as destroying nineteen houses.
