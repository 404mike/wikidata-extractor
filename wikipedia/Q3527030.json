England won the toss and elected to bat, making 220 for five on the first day, with an opening partnership of 125 between Gooch and Broad.  Marshall picked up four wickets, including England's top three, with Ambrose claiming the fifth wicket.  Play was extended by thirty minutes due to the slow over rate of the West Indies.  The West Indies dominated the second day, with Ambrose and Marshall taking the remaining five wickets for 22 runs, the latter taking 6 wickets for 69 runs.  In reply, Greenidge and Haynes made a first-wicket partnership of 54 against the bowling of Dilley and DeFreitas, before Greenidge was caught behind from the bowling of Paul Jarvis.  Richardson was then caught by Gatting off Emburey for 17.  Richards entered the field and between him and Haynes, took the West Indies to 125 for two by close of play.  Day three was rain-affected, with England managing to take the wickets of Richards and Haynes, but only after both had made half-centuries.  Play closed early due to the inclement weather with the West Indies on 264 for 4, holding a lead of 19 with six wickets remaining. A rest day followed the third day, and on day four, the West Indies extended their lead over England.  With 80 from Hooper, and an eighth-wicket partnership of 91 between Ambrose and Marshall, Richards declared on 448 for 9, a lead of 203, with less than four hours of the day's play remaining.  England made slow progress for the remainder of the day, making it to 67 for one after 31 overs, with opener Gooch not out on 38.

Australia then wobbled, Allan Border out for 1, and Dean Jones out for a fourth ball duck, before ever reliable Steve Waugh joined David Boon, and the pair added the remaining 50 runs required for victory, the winning runs brought up by David Boon, who memorably swept Paul Jarvis to the square leg boundary for four to win. Boon ended on 58 not out, and Waugh, 21 not out, was yet to be dismissed in the series. Steve Waugh was named man of the match for his first innings 152*, which set up the victory when the game was evenly poised.", "Allan Border would have still held out a faint hope of victory on the morning of day five, but it seemed unlikely. Fraser failed to add to his overnight score and was run out for 12 soon after the resumption. Emburey and Graham Dilley added 30 for the ninth wicket, much to the frustration of the Australians before Emburey fell for a well made 26 to a sharp chance taken by David Boon off Lawson. If the ninth wicket stand of 30 had frustrated the Australian bowlers the 10th wicket partnership of 27 between Dilley and Paul Jarvis was just annoying, and made an Australian victory all but impossible. Alderman finally trapped Jarivs LBW with what was fast becoming his trademark of the series, the inswinging yorker, but England had struggled to 242, which although a disappointing score, had dragged out their innings long enough to avoid the follow-on and not leave the Australians with enough time for victory."]}, {"page": "Jarvis (name)", "response": ["* Paul Jarvis, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Worthing Cricket Club", "response": ["The club was a founder member of the Sussex League, having been a member since its inception in 1971.
