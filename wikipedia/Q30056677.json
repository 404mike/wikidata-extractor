He was born at Ordsall, Nottinghamshire and died at Kilburn, London.\nBury was educated at Winchester College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he appears to have been a lower-order batsman and a second-line bowler, though his batting and bowling styles are not known and with the limited survival of records from his era his precise bowling figures are also not known. He won a Blue by playing in the 1855 University Match for Cambridge against Oxford University, which was his last first-class game. A younger brother, William, also played cricket for Cambridge University and another brother, Frederick, played in the first first-class cricket match in the West Indies.\nBury graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1856 and was ordained as a Church of England deacon in 1859 and as a priest in 1860. He served as the vicar of Attenborough with Bramcote, Nottinghamshire, from 1861 to 1875 and then as rector of Aisthorpe with West Thorpe, Lincolnshire to 1898; he retired to a curacy of a church in Hastings, East Sussex in 1900.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Bury", "response": ["Thomas Bury may refer to:", "* Thomas Bury (cricketer) (1831\u20131918), English cricketer", "* Thomas Bury (judge) (1655\u20131722), English judge and Chief Baron of the Exchequer"]}, {"page": "Frederick Bury", "response": ["Bury was born in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, in 1836, where his father was the vicar.Frederick Bury \u2013 CricketArchive.
