This process is formally termed DNA profiling, also called DNA fingerprinting. In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA. However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people. DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys, and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case.Colin Pitchfork\u00a0\u2013 first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 December 2006"]}, {"page": "January 9", "response": ["*1950 \u2013 Alec Jeffreys, English geneticist and academic "]}, {"page": "DNA profiling", "response": ["Starting in the 1980s, scientific advances allowed the use of DNA as a material for the identification of an individual.

It was developed by Sir Alec Jeffreys, who realized that variation in the genetic sequence could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.", "Later in the 20th century several British pathologists, Mikey Rochman, Francis Camps, Sydney Smith and Keith Simpson pioneered new forensic science methods. Alec Jeffreys pioneered the use of DNA profiling in forensic science in 1984. He realized the scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the genetic code to identify individuals. The method has since become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. DNA fingerprinting was first used as a police forensic test to identify the rapist and killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who were both murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of murder after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls."]}, {"page": "Leicester", "response": ["* Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys : 26 November 1992."]}, {"page": "Luton", "response": ["* Alec Jeffreys, geneticist"]}, {"page": "Timeline of biology and organic chemistry", "response": ["* 1984 \u2013 Alec Jeffreys devised a genetic fingerprinting method."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["* Alec Jeffreys (born 1950), British biochemist and geneticist who invented genetic fingerprinting"]}, {"page": "Merton College, Oxford", "response": ["Merton has also produced notable alumni in more recent times.
