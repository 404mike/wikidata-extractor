In 1913, she was appointed Hildred Carlisle Professor of English at the University of London and became head of the Department of English at Bedford College, London. She was the first woman to be awarded a chair at the University of London, and only the third in Britain (after Edith Morley and Millicent Mackenzie). She co-founded the International Federation of University Women with Virginia Gildersleeve.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Macbeth", "response": ["This opinion recurs in critical literature, and, according to Caroline Spurgeon, is supported by Shakespeare himself, who apparently intended to degrade his hero by vesting him with clothes unsuited to him and to make Macbeth look ridiculous by several exaggerations he applies: His garments seem either too big or too small for him\u00a0\u2013 as his ambition is too big and his character too small for his new and unrightful role as king. When he feels as if \"dressed in borrowed robes\", after his new title as Thane of Cawdor, prophesied by the witches, has been confirmed by Ross (I, 3, ll. 108\u2013109), Banquo comments: \"New honours come upon him,Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould,But with the aid of use\" (I, 3, ll. 145\u2013146). And, at the end, when the tyrant is at bay at Dunsinane, Caithness sees him as a man trying in vain to fasten a large garment on him with too small a belt: \"He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause  Within the belt of rule\" (V, 2, ll. 14\u201315) while Angus sums up what everybody thinks ever since Macbeth's accession to power: \"now does he feel his title  Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe  upon a dwarfish thief\" (V, 2, ll. 18\u201320)."]}, {"page": "Romeo and Juliet", "response": ["Scholars have long noted Shakespeare's widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as \"symbolic of the natural beauty of young love\" and later critics have expanded on this interpretation. For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun,Romeo and Juliet, II.ii. brighter than a torch,Romeo and Juliet, I.v.42. a jewel sparkling in the night,Romeo and Juliet, I.v.44\u201345. and a bright angel among dark clouds.Romeo and Juliet, II.ii.26\u201332. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her \"beauty makes / This vault a feasting presence full of light.\"Romeo and Juliet, I.v.85\u201386. Juliet describes Romeo as \"day in night\" and \"Whiter than snow upon a raven's back.\"Romeo and Juliet, III.ii.17\u201319. This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols\u2014contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony. For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet. The \"light\" theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars."]}, {"page": "University of London", "response": ["The University of London (UoL; abbreviated as Lond or more rarely Londin in post-nominals) is a federal public research university located in London, England, United Kingdom. The university was established by royal charter in 1836, as a degree-awarding examination board for students holding certificates from University College London and King's College London and \"other such other Institutions, corporate or unincorporated, as shall be established for the purpose of Education, whether within the Metropolis or elsewhere within our United Kingdom\", allowing it to be one of three institutions to claim the title of the third-oldest university in England, and moved to a federal structure in 1900.

It was the first university in the United Kingdom to introduce examinations for women in 1869 and, a decade later, the first to admit women to degrees. In 1913, it appointed Caroline Spurgeon as only the second woman professor at a British university, and in 1948 was the first British university to appoint a woman as its vice chancellor (chief executive).

Later, she lived with the Barnard English professor, Elizabeth Reynard, and they both are buried at Saint Matthew's Episcopal Churchyard, Bedford, New York. This has given some a basis to speculate about Gildersleeve's sexuality. In her 1954 memoir, Gildersleeve protested the \"particularly cruel and unwholesome discrimination against unmarried women\" who chose to spend their lives living with other women. She attributed this trend to \"the less responsible psychologists and psychiatrists of the day\", who voiced \"disrespect for spinsters in the teaching profession as 'inhibited' and 'frustrated'\". Gildersleeve used \"celibate\" to describe her status. ", "Gildersleeve and Spurgeon met just after the First World War ended, when a delegation of British educators came to the United States. Caroline Spurgeon, a highly respected Shakespeare scholar who published many books and papers about both Chaucer and Shakespeare, taught at Bedford College for Women, part of the University of London. They collaborated in establishing an organization that would foster international cooperation among like-minded academic women. Gildersleeve imagined an organization built on the model of the American Association of Collegiate Alumnae and the British Federation of University Women. In 1919, they created the International Federation of University Women (IFUW), housing it in London with a second home in Paris at Reid Hall. For two decades, between World War I and World War II, Gildersleeve worked through the IFUW to keep alive the spirit of international understanding, even as isolationism gripped her country.

Other notable women who were part of BFWG in its early years included Winifred Cullis, Rose Sidgwick and Caroline Spurgeon. Associations were set up across Britain to pursue these aims by lobbying government and by fulfilling the BFUW motto: \"Let us perfect the art of friendship\". During World War I, BFUW compiled a register of university women offering themselves for public service which was used by the Board of Trade.  After the war there was still the need to work for the opening of the professions to women, though a few members gained places in local government, notably Sybil Campbell, Monica Mary Geikie Cobb (the first woman barrister to hold a brief), Margaret Kydd (one of the first women to take silk), and Rose Heilbron.
