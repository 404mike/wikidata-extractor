He signed several players from northern clubs, including Harry Erentz, Tom Smith and, in particular, John Cameron, who signed from Everton in May 1898 and was to have a considerable impact on the history of the club. Cameron became player-manager the following February after Bretell left to take a better-paid position at Portsmouth, and led the club to its first trophies: the Southern League title in 1899\u20131900 and the 1901 FA Cup.  In his first year as manager, Cameron signed seven players: George Clawley, Ted Hughes, David Copeland, Tom Morris, Jack Kirwan, Sandy Tait and Tom Pratt. The following year Sandy Brown replaced Pratt, who wanted to return to the North despite being the top goalscorer. They, together with Cameron, Erentz, Smith and Jones, formed the 1901 Cup-winning team."]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["The replay took place the following Wednesday at The Dell with an attendance of 10,000 including a large contingent of Spurs fans. Spurs took the lead through Ted Hughes before Edgar Chadwick equalised; another goal from Hughes was matched by one from Joe Turner and after normal time the match was level at 2\u20132. With extra time only being played by agreement between the teams, the referee Arthur Kingscott consulted the captains who agreed to play on \"in an attempt to achieve a definite result\". During the extra time, no further goals were scored but several Southampton players were injured; Albert Brown required lengthy treatment after colliding with Hughes and then Bowman suffered severe cramp and as a result Joe Turner had to drop back to cover for him at centre-half. The worst injury was to Bert Lee, who was kicked on the head and was forced to miss the replay."]}, {"page": "Ted Hughes (disambiguation)", "response": ["Ted Hughes was an English poet.", "Ted Hughes may also refer to:", "*Ted Hughes (footballer), Welsh footballer", "*Ted Hughes (judge), Canadian judge"]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 World Championship (football)", "response": ["| ||  ||Ted Hughes"]}]}}
