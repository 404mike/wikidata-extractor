He began his professional football career with Exeter City in June 1992 and made 5 first team appearances before dropping into the non-leagues with Dorchester Town.\nIn April 1997 he joined Swindon Town for a fee of \u00a325,000 playing over 60 games for the First Division club. He had a month on loan with Plymouth Argyle from October 1998 and moved to Plymouth in August 1999 for a fee of \u00a330,000. Taylor was made captain of his home team, making almost 100 appearances during his spell there. A broken ankle against Southend United put Taylor out for the best part of 2 years.\nIn February 2003, Taylor joined Torquay United on loan, initially for a month's cover as both Sean Hankin and Steve Woods were sidelined with injuries. The loan deal was extended to the end of the season and he signed for Torquay on a free transfer in June 2003.The following season (2003/2004) he captained The Gulls to promotion to League One.\nHe spent much of the early part of the 2006\u201307 season out of the Torquay side due to injury, but returned to the squad as an unused substitute in the 1\u20130 defeat at home to Boston United on 16 December 2006. On his last appearance Taylor played in the 1\u20131 draw with Leyton Orient, scoring Torquay's only goal. Taylor retired from football in May 2007 due to recurring back and ankle injuries.\nHis brother Shaun also played professionally for Swindon Town.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2002\u201303 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["| 13 June 2003 ||  Craig Taylor || Torquay United || Free", "| 24 February 2003 ||  Craig Taylor || Torquay United || 4 May 2003"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"center\"|-||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Craig Taylor", "|1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||||||Craig Taylor"]}, {"page": "Craig Taylor", "response": ["Craig Taylor may refer to:", "* Craig Taylor (footballer) (born 1974), English footballer", "* Craig Taylor (writer) (born 1976), Canadian writer", "* Craig Taylor (fl. 2000s), American musician in Lydia", "* Craig Taylor (American football) (born 1966), former American football running back", "* S.

Taylor was previously the youth coach at Exeter City and was also brother to former Torquay defender Craig Taylor.  With Taylor on board, Ling now looked to bring new players to Torquay.  Firstly, Joe Oastler signed a permanent two-year deal with Torquay after being released by QPR, while Danny Stevens also agreed in principle to renew his contract.  Another familiar face who returned to Torquay was Chris McPhee.  He had played for the Gulls during their disastrous 2006\u201307 season and was looking to make amends on his return to the club.  Joining on the same day as McPhee was Daniel Leadbitter, a promising young defender who had just been released by Newcastle United."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["| 26|| || DF|| Craig Taylor|| 46|| 0|| 3"]}]}}
