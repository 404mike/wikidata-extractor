After winning back-to-back Northern Ireland Amateur Championships in 2008 and 2009, he made his debut on the professional tour in 2009\u201310 but lost his tour card after one season. He rejoined the tour in 2018 after qualifying via Q School.\nHe made his Crucible debut at the 2020 World Snooker Championship. In January 2021, he reached the quarterfinals of the German Masters, and in February 2021, he won his first ranking title at the Welsh Open, defeating Ronnie O'Sullivan 9\u20138 in the final. Ranked 81st in the world before the event, and rated a 750\u20131 outsider by bookmakers, he became the lowest-ranked player to win a ranking event since 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jimmy White", "response": ["In the Wembley Masters, White played Mark King in the wild card round, but lost the match 2\u20136. Prior to the World Championship, he won only two of his six qualifying matches: he defeated Bjorn Haneveer 5\u20130 at the Shanghai Masters and Jordan Brown 5\u20131 at the Welsh Open. Due to this disappointment, and skipping the 2009 UK Championship for I'm a Celebrity...Get Me out of Here!, he was at risk of losing his Main Tour spot for the following season. However, he secured his place on the Main Tour for another season with a 10\u20138 victory over Mark Boyle at the World Championship Qualifiers.

He made a maximum break during the final, and compiled another 147 break in his second-round match against Mark Davis at the 2012 UK Championship. He also won the minor-ranking Kay Suzanne Memorial Trophy, defeating Trump 4\u20132 in the final, and reached the final of the minor-ranking Bulgarian Open, where he lost 0\u20134 to Trump. However, the season thereafter was another disappointing one for Higgins, who lost 3\u20134 to unranked amateur Jordan Brown at the minor-ranking Scottish Open and reached only one other semi-final of a major ranking event, the World Open, which he lost 2\u20136 to Mark Allen. He exited the World Championship in the first round, losing 6\u201310 to Mark Davis. Afterward, he admitted that doubts about whether he could remain at the pinnacle of the sport after 20 years as a professional had affected his form.
