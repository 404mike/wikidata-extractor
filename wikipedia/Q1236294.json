He published several illustrated works on insects and antiquities. He was among the first entomologists with an academic position at Oxford University. He was a natural theologian, staunchly anti-Darwinian, and sometimes adopted a quinarian viewpoint. Although he never travelled widely, he described species from around the world on the basis of specimens, especially of the larger, curious, and colourful species, obtained by naturalists and collectors in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford University Museum of Natural History", "response": ["The Hope Entomological Collections, numbering over 5 million specimens are held by the museum.
