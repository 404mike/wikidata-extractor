They are an approximate solution to the Schrodinger equation for the electrons bound to the atom by the electric field of the atom's nucleus. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the state of an atom, i.e., an eigenstate of the atomic Hamiltonian, is approximated by an expansion (see configuration interaction expansion and basis set) into linear combinations of anti-symmetrized products (Slater determinants) of one-electron functions. The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called atomic orbitals. (When one considers also their spin component, one speaks of atomic spin orbitals.) A state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the electrons, so that their motion is correlated, but this is often approximated by this independent-particle model of products of single electron wave functions.Roger Penrose, The Road to Reality (The London dispersion force, for example, depends on the correlations of the motion of the electrons.)"]}, {"page": "August 8", "response": ["*1931 \u2013 Roger Penrose, English physicist, mathematician, and philosopher"]}, {"page": "Aeon", "response": ["Roger Penrose uses the word aeon to describe the period between successive and cyclic Big Bangs within the context of conformal cyclic cosmology."]}, {"page": "Anthropic principle", "response": ["Roger Penrose explained the weak form as follows:"]}, {"page": "Big Bang", "response": ["In 1968 and 1970, Roger Penrose, Stephen Hawking, and George F.

In 1981, Alan Guth made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical problems in the Big Bang theory with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called \"inflation\".

However, in the late 1960s Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking used global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically. For this work, Penrose received half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hawking having died in 2018.

However, while there is consensus that this solves the initial conditions problem, some have disputed this, as it is much more likely that the Universe came about by a quantum fluctuation. Don Page was an outspoken critic of inflation because of this anomaly.; see also Roger Penrose's book The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe. He stressed that the thermodynamic arrow of time necessitates low entropy initial conditions, which would be highly unlikely.

Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories have been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals such as those of Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein.

In his view, applying conventional quantum mechanics to the universe implies the MWI, but the lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional quantum mechanics. According to Penrose, \"the rules must change when gravity is involved\". He further asserts that gravity helps anchor reality and \"blurry\" events have only one allowable outcome: \"electrons, atoms, molecules, etc., are so minute that they require almost no amount of energy to maintain their gravity, and therefore their overlapping states. They can stay in that state forever, as described in standard quantum theory\". On the other hand, \"in the case of large objects, the duplicate states disappear in an instant due to the fact that these objects create a large gravitational field\".", "According to Martin Gardner, the \"other\" worlds of MWI have two different interpretations: real or unreal; he claimed that Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claimed that most physicists favour the unreal interpretation, whereas the \"realist\" view is supported only by MWI experts such as Deutsch and DeWitt. Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is \"trivially true\". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded MWI as \"self-evidently correct\" but was dismissive of questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, \"When I hear of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, I reach for my gun.\" In the same interview, he also said, \"But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities\u2014in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many-worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities.\" Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the \"reality\" of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, \"He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully.\""]}, {"page": "Entropy", "response": ["If the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then \u2013 as Roger Penrose has pointed out \u2013 gravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into black holes. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's event horizon. Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size. This makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes, if they are totally effective matter and energy traps.
