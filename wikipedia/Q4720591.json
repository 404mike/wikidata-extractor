The Mac OS\u00a0X version has not yet been released, while the iOS version was retired in March 2015. The special edition includes updated graphics, updated high-quality audio engine, new voice-overs, additional content such as concept art, and an in-game hint system. The \"lite\" mode from the original game (\"for game reviewers\") has been omitted. Further, the original introductory sequence with the main musical theme has been removed, purportedly because it displayed credits for the original game, now outdated. Players can opt to switch from the updated version into the original at any time during the game, though an option allows players to retain the voice-overs of the remake. Players can opt to use the original point-and-click control scheme, or can directly control the movements of Guybrush using a control pad or similar device. The remake was announced by LucasArts during their annual Game Developers Conference on March 10, 2010, with the previous creators of the adventures, Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, in attendance. The trio of game designers have recorded a commentary track for the Special Edition that can be brought up in many locations, using silhouettes in the fashion of Mystery Science Theater 3000 overlaid on the graphics. Craig Derrick announced on a new interface that was in the vein of The Curse of Monkey Island's and a return of the original voice cast, including Dominic Armato as Guybrush, Alexandra Boyd as Elaine, Earl Boen as LeChuck, and even Neil Ross as Wally.

Created by Ron Gilbert for LucasArts, the character first appears in The Secret of Monkey Island and is one of the core characters in the franchise. Originally conceived as a ruthless island governor, the character evolved during development into the protagonist's love interest.

Boyd explains that she got the part of Elaine as she had worked with voice director Darragh O'Farrell previously; O'Farrell brought Boyd in to read for the part. Boyd joked that \"I figured I got the part because I have red hair like her\". Boyd was not contacted to return as the character for Escape from Monkey Island; Elaine was instead voiced by American actress Charity James. Nevertheless, Boyd reprised the role for Telltale Games' Tales of Monkey Island and the later enhanced remakes of the first two games. Boyd was glad to return, stating that the character \"is very well written and it\u2019s fun doing all that shouting at LeChuck and Guybrush! Exhausting but fun\". Rather than travelling to Telltale's studio in San Rafael, Boyd instead recorded her lines for Tales of Monkey Island in London, communicating with the director remotely with Skype. The development of Elaine's character was one of Gilbert's aims for Tales of Monkey Island; Gilbert wanted Elaine to \"be better informed and more capable than most of the other characters\".", "Eurogamer commended Elaine's design as \"worthy of acclaim\", naming her the \"Best Female Supporting Character\" in their 2001 annual Gaming Globes awards, while IGN described her alongside Guybrush and LeChuck as one of \"the most beloved adventure characters of all time\". Alexandra Boyd and Charity James too have been praised for their voicing of Elaine; Computer Games Magazine described Boyd's work for The Curse of Monkey Island as \"wonderful\", though lamented that she did not speak more in the game, while Macworld admired the character's depiction in Escape from Monkey Island as \"beautiful and plucky\".  Gadgette also listed Elaine as 4th of their favorite female video game character. IGN India, The Guardian, and GamesRadar all claimed that Elaine and Guybrush were the best video game romance."]}, {"page": "Lloyd Mullaney", "response": ["After Steve has a one-night stand with Becky, Steve's girlfriend Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) becomes suspicious when Steve and Lloyd's behaviour seems strange.
