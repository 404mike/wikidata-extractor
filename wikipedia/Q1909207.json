The The is an English rock band, fronted by singer/songwriter Matt Johnson, who has served as the only constant member of the band since its formation.  After having spent the majority of their career on Epic Records, the band found themselves at creative odds with their label over the recording of The The's 1997 album Gun Sluts.  The songs were more experimental in nature and Epic requested that Johnson revise the album to add more radio-friendly content, to which Johnson refused.  Johnson also delivered a second studio album, entitled NakedSelf, to the label.  \"They didn't like that either.  They asked me if I could make it more commercial and I was outraged.  I said 'forget it,'\" Johnson recalled.  With both sides at an impasse, Johnson decided it was time to part ways with Epic.  After a year of legal wrangling, the band was finally freed from their deal with Epic / Sony.  In spite of their creative differences, Johnson stated, \"The split from them was amicable, it wasn't acrimonious.  I had a very positive relationship with Epic at that time, but they became really, really pop oriented and I was thoroughly marginalized.\"", "For the first time in eighteen years, The The were free agents, in search of a new label.  Nothing Records president John A. Malm, Jr. was a huge fan of The The and became eager to sign them to Nothing Records. Trent Reznor too had been a big fan of the band, stating \"Matt Johnson's music was one of the main reasons I began working on Nine Inch Nails.  The passion, the honesty and the nakedness of his work opened doors of possibilities in my head.\"  A contract offer from Nothing was accepted by the band in 1999, with Johnson initially very optimistic about the ideology of label and their partnership, commenting at the time, \"The music industry is increasing corporatization, homogenization and general awfulness.  It was a simple decision for me to choose Nothing Records, I feel we share many of the same beliefs and passions and already it feels like a natural home to me.  I'm feeling galvanized and extremely excited about the next few years.\"", "Although the band already had Gun Sluts completed, they opted to leave it unreleased, which is how it remains to this day.  Instead Johnson decided to focus on NakedSelf for Nothing Records.  NakedSelf did, however, feature one track, \"DesielBreeze,\" from the unreleased Gun Sluts album.  Overall, the album was a mature, contemplative piece, released on February 29, 2000 on Nothing Records to wide critical acclaim.  A deluxe CD version was also released, featuring an expanded booklet of photography.  Instead of a traditional music video to promote the album, the band filmed a trailer for the album.  The NakedSelf trailer featured several excerpts from album set to video footage, as well as interview clips with Matt Johnson.  The trailer appeared on The The's website and was released as a promotional piece to press and music video outlets.  However, it quietly vanished from circulation in subsequent years and has become sought-after by collectors.", "It was during the promotional stage of the album that Matt Johnson began to feel a heightened frustration with the lack of support from Nothing Records.  Johnson recalled, \"In Detroit, I got a call from an NPR station.  They said they'd been begging the label for copies of the album and they wouldn't give them one.  NPR had to beg and phone and beg and eventually got one.  Then the NPR affiliate had to send someone to drive forty minutes to pick me up and take me to the station to do the interview, because the record label wouldn't do it.  I've never known anything like it.\"  With a great deal of personal, professional and emotional investment in NakedSelf, Johnson began to feel deep unhappiness toward his partnership with Nothing Records and the emerging, corporate conglomerate controlling them, which consisted of Interscope Records, Universal Music Distribution, Seagram's and Vivendi Entertainment.  While many of the other acts on the label opted to quietly depart, or fight their battles in private, Johnson elected to make his battle very public, publishing an essay on his website called \"The The Vs. The Corporate Monster.\"  The essay detailed Johnson's extreme dissatisfaction over his experiences with the label, although his targets were primarily Seagrams and the larger music corporations as a whole.  Johnson wrote in the essay:", "In June 2002, The The played the Meltdown Festival in at London's Royal Festival Music Hall as guests of David Bowie.  The performance consisted of Matt Johnson and J. G. Thirlwell performing tapes and loops before video projections.  Also available at the show was an exclusive double CD, entitled Film Music.  The first disc, called Silent Tongue, consisted of unreleased film music, while the second disc was the 45 RPM collection.  It was never made available again after the show and remains one of the most sought-after releases amongst fans.  The performance also remains The The's final show to date, although Johnson has announced a series of new The The shows for 2018; their first in 16 years.", "After 2002, Johnson entered a long-term, self-imposed exile from the music industry, with only sparse releases of the band, all self-released through Johnson's Lazarus label.  In 2007, the band released a single for a new song, entitled \"Mrs Mac\", an autobiographical song about Johnson's first day at school as a child.  In 2010, they released a CD soundtrack to the film Tony, which was directed by Matt Johnson's brother, Gerard Johnson.  In 2012, they released a soundtrack to the film Moonbug, directed by Nichola Bruce.  In 2015, the band released another soundtrack to the film Hyena, also directed by Johnson's brother Gerard.  In 2017, the film The Inertia Variations, directed by Johanna St. Michaels began playing the film festival circuit.  The documentary chronicles the band's career.
