Fripp's four new recruits were free-improvising percussionist Jamie Muir, drummer Bill Bruford (who left Yes at a commercial peak in their career in favour of the \"darker\" Crimson), bassist and vocalist John Wetton, and violinist, keyboardist and flautist David Cross, whom Fripp had met when he was invited to a rehearsal of Waves, a band Cross was working in. Most of the musical compositions were collaborations between Fripp and Wetton, who each composed segments independently and fitted together those which they found compatible. Event occurs at 4:34-13:48. With Sinfield gone, the band recruited Wetton's friend Richard Palmer-James (from the original Supertramp) as their new lyricist. Unlike Sinfield, Palmer-James played no part in artistic decisions, visual ideas, or sonic directions; his sole contributions to the group were his lyrics, sent via mail from his home in Germany. Following a period of rehearsals, King Crimson resumed touring on 13 October 1972 at the Zoom Club in Frankfurt, with the band's penchant for improvisation (and Muir's startling stage presence) gaining them renewed press attention.", "*Jamie Muir \u2013 percussion "]}, {"page": "Musical saw", "response": ["* Jamie Muir of the progressive rock band King Crimson briefly uses a musical saw on the song \"Easy Money\" from the album Larks' Tongues in Aspic.

From this point onwards, Fripp would be the only constant member of the band, which in turn would be defined primarily by his compositional and conceptual ideas (which drew on avant-garde jazz and improvisation mixed with a variety of hard rock and European influences, in particular the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k). With avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir, violinist David Cross, singing bass player John Wetton and former Yes drummer Bill Bruford now in the ranks, King Crimson produced three more albums of innovative and increasingly experimental rock, shedding members as they progressed: beginning with Larks' Tongues in Aspic, progressing with Starless and Bible Black and culminating in the benchmark avant-power trio album Red. Fripp formally disbanded the group in 1974, in what eventually turned out to be merely the first in a regular series of long hiatuses and further transformations."]}, {"page": "Derek Bailey (guitarist)", "response": ["In 1966, Bailey moved to London.

One of which involved a \"large-scale composition\" as the group had success with longform pieces, including the 18-minute title track from Close to the Edge. With the idea in mind Anderson found himself \"caught up in a lengthy footnote\" in Autobiography of a Yogi (1946) by Paramahansa Yogananda which outlines four bodies of Hindu texts, named shastras, that Yogananda described as \"comprehensive treatises [that cover] every aspect of religious and social life, and the fields of law, medicine, architecture, art...\" that \"convey profound truths under a veil of detailed symbolism\". Anderson \"became engrossed\" with the idea of a \"four-part epic\" concept album based on the four texts, though he later admitted that he did not fully understand what the scriptures were about. He was introduced to Yogananda by King Crimson drummer and percussionist Jamie Muir at Bruford's wedding reception on 2 March 1973. Anderson said of Muir: \"I felt I had to learn from him. We started talking about meditation in music\u2014not the guru type but some really heavy stuff.\" Anderson gained further clarification of the texts from talking to Vera Stanley Alder, a mystic, painter, and author of spirituality books that had a profound influence on him."]}, {"page": "Allan Holdsworth", "response": ["Holdsworth first recorded in 1969 with the band 'Igginbottom on their lone release, 'Igginbottom's Wrench (later reissued under the group name of \"Allan Holdsworth & Friends\").
