These two matches were against the touring Australians and Kent.\nBorn in Pickering, North Riding of Yorkshire, England, Coverdale was a wicket-keeper, taking two catches between the two matches.  His batting was less than successful, with only two runs in two completed innings.  Yorkshire saved the match against the Australians, scoring 344 for 7 after being forced to follow on.  Kent were also forced to follow on in his final match, but again good batting secured them a draw.\nCoverdale died in September 1934, in Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, aged 72.", "link_mentions": {}}}
