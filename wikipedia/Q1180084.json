It was a logical outcome of the influence of Aristotle who before all else was a patient observer of nature, and was, in fact, the founder of modern science.\" Ch.1, Introduction \u2014De Lacy O'Leary (1949), How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs, London:  Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd.,  His demonstration method is found in Posterior Analytics. He provided another of the ingredients of scientific tradition: empiricism. For Aristotle, universal truths can be known from particular things via induction. To some extent then, Aristotle reconciles abstract thought with observation, although it would be a mistake to imply that Aristotelian science is empirical in form.  Indeed, Aristotle did not accept that knowledge acquired by induction could rightly be counted as scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, induction was for him a necessary preliminary to the main business of scientific enquiry, providing the primary premises required for scientific demonstrations."]}, {"page": "Geography and cartography in medieval Islam", "response": ["* \"How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs\" by De Lacy O'Leary"]}, {"page": "Islamic world contributions to Medieval Europe", "response": ["* \"How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs\" by De Lacy O'Leary"]}, {"page": "Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)", "response": ["*De Lacy O'Leary (1872\u20131957) Bristol Univ.

The muqarnas squinch was a complex innovation. In it a niche was placed between two niche segments, over which there was another niche. It is possible that this design had Iranian inspiration.  A similar system was applied to window building. According to De Lacy O'Leary, the horse-shoe arch was developed in Egypt under Fatimid rule and is not of Persian origin as is commonly thought. This architectural style can be witnessed in the North African Fatimid Mosques as well as Al Jame Al Zaituna, a mosque of which the central dome and the courtyard has been constructed long after the Fatimids relocated their capital to Egypt."]}, {"page": "De Lacy Evans O'Leary", "response": ["#redirect De Lacy O'Leary"]}, {"page": "Evans De Lacy O'Leary", "response": ["#redirect De Lacy O'Leary"]}, {"page": "De Lacy O\u2019Leary", "response": ["#redirect De Lacy O'Leary"]}, {"page": "List of Christian scientists and scholars of the medieval Islamic world", "response": ["* Salmawaih ibn Bunan (died 840)  Assyrian Nestorian Christian physician and translator.De Lacy O'Leary How Greek science passed to the Arabs \"How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs\" online 2002- Page 166 \"Hunayn had many other friends and clients, mostly physicians of Jundi-Shapur and those who had removed to Baghdad and used the Arabic language, like Salmawaih ibn Bunan an alumnus of Jundi-Shapur who became court physician to ...\" "]}]}}
