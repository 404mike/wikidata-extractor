Richard Cresswell was appointed as Wilcox's first-team coach, having previously held a consultancy role at the club since April 2014.

In the 76th minute Hyde put York back in the lead with a close-range finish before Josh Windass scored for Accrington with a 20-yard free kick in the 90th minute. This result meant York were one point above the relegation zone, but just two points from the bottom of the table. Ahead of the transfer deadline for loan signings, York signed two strikers on loan for the rest of the season; Shaun Miller from Coventry City and Josh O'Hanlon from Bournemouth. York moved three points above the relegation zone after beating Mansfield 4\u20131 away, Lowe opening the scoring with a header before Coulthirst scored with a low finish.
