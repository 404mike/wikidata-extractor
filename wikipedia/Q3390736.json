Wright in 1954, after which it was largely abandoned in favor of the competing shape theory. A 1996 paper by Luca Turin revived the theory by proposing a mechanism, speculating that the G-protein-coupled receptors discovered by Linda Buck and Richard Axel were actually measuring molecular vibrations using inelastic electron tunneling as Turin claimed, rather than responding to molecular keys fitting molecular locks, working by shape alone. In 2007 a Physical Review Letters paper by Marshall Stoneham and colleagues at University College London and Imperial College London showed that Turin's proposed mechanism was consistent with known physics and coined the expression \"swipe card model\" to describe it. A PNAS paper in 2011 by Turin, Efthimios Skoulakis, and colleagues at MIT and the Alexander Fleming Biomedical Sciences Research Center reported fly behavioral experiments consistent with a vibrational theory of smell. The theory remains controversial."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|Arthur Marshall Stoneham||16/03/1989||18 May 1940 \u2013 18 February 2011"]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*18 February \u2013 Marshall Stoneham, physicist (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2011", "response": ["*Marshall Stoneham, 70, British physicist, complications of surgery."]}]}}
