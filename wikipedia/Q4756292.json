Dunfermline were controlling the game until, against the run off play, Hibs scored. A throw-in on the right, just inside Dunfermline's half, was flicked on to Ivan Sproule, who walked through some poor defending to easily slot home. Hibs then took charge of the game and Paul Gallacher had to make a super one-on-one save from Garry O'Connor. However, in the second half O'Connor's shot, after being allowed to turn by Austin McCann, deflected off Keddie and past the hapless Gallacher. Dunfermline then attacked and were rewarded under two minutes later after Ryan Thomson powered through the Hibs team and finished well. A Joe Cardle drive was then parried out to J. Thomson who scuffed his shot off Paul Hanlon and into the net. Dunfermline nearly won the game with attempts from Cardle, Andrew Barrowman and the impressive David Graham, all not finding the goal. Final Score:2\u20132</", "This was a game which showed the gulf of class between the Old Firm and the rest of the league. Rangers took the lead in less than 10 minutes with a Carlos Bocanegra header from a corner. A few minutes later Maurice Edu fired home an excellent shot from 20 yards to make it 2\u20130. A penalty appeal for Rangers was then turned down, despite J Thomson appearing to be holding onto Bocanegra. Steven Naismith was then lucky not to be sent off as he elbowed Austin McCann in the face during a free-kick. The referee missed it, but he was caught by the cameras and subsequently banned.</ Allan McGregor then had his first save to make after Paul Burns's bouncing shot had to be turned away. Early in the second half a through ball by Steven Davis was slotted home by Naismith to make it 3\u20130. McGregor then was forced into a fine save after David Graham got one-on-one with him after a fine through ball by Andrew Barrowman. Naismith then finished off the scoring after a fast break by Rangers left them five on three against Dufermline and an unselfish Nikica Jelavic squared it for Naismith's second off the day. It would have been more if Paul Gallacher hadn't made some excellent saves including two free-kicks from Davis and Jelavic as well as 35-yard volley from Steven Whittaker. Dunfermline gave the ball away far too many times during the game with Gary Mason and J Thomson the worst offenders. Final Score 0\u20134</", "The first of the experimental Friday night football games this season with met with a routing of Dunfermline by Aberdeen. An early goal from a Scott Vernon header from Ricky Foster's cross put the Dons in a commanding position. Aberdeen's left-back Foster was the key man providing the best attacking threat with his dangerous crosses and only a string of super saves by Paul Gallacher kept the score at 1\u20130. But half an hour later Vernon's second headed goal of the night, after Youl Mawene's flick on, put Aberdeen in a comfortable lead. Replays later confirmed that Vernon was offside when the ball was played, but the goal would stand. A third goal came on the stroke of half-time with a Foster cross being controlled by Vernon and he had time to flick the ball onto Fraser Fyvie who slotted home. So far, Dunfermline's only chance had been an Andrew Barrowman header which went just past the post. Barrowman then had a second half shot turned round the post as he provided Dunfermline's attacking threat. A final goal came by Vernon after Mohamed Chalali's shot hit the post and rebounded nicely. Manager McIntyre criticised a dire performance all round by Dunfermline</ with Jason Thomson and John Potter later criticised heavily. Only Gallacher escaped the managers wrath. Final Score 0\u20134</", "An already hard task away at one of the Old Firm was made harder in just over 5 minutes, when Paul Willis played a backwards pass straight to Gary Hooper who took two touches into the box and fired home across the box into the bottom left hand corner. Alex Keddie then gave the ball away on the half-way line and Jamie Forrest, Hooper and Kris Commons combined to switch the ball across to the left hand side to Anthony Stokes. He drove low at goal and Paul Gallacher's parry reached Hooper who flicked it backwards to Forrest, who smashed in into the roof of the net. A long range drive from Biram Kayal was then saved by Gallacher's stretched leg. Dunfermline then had a penalty appeal turned away after Daniel Majstorovi\u0107 climbed over the back off Ryan Thomson. Celtic continued to look for a second and Gallacher and Keddie combined to keep out Commons after a low cross from the left by Stokes. Stokes then somehow missed from two yards out, mistiming his back post volley. In the second half Paul Burns felled Forrest in the box, to give away a penalty. Ki then sent Gallacher the wrong way, but hit the outside of the post, from the spot. Stokes then missed a one-on-one chance, hitting the post again. Joe Cardle went close for the Pars, cutting inside from the left forcing Fraser Forster into a good low save. He then made another as Liam Buchanan was sent through, but the keep was out fast to block the attempted chip. David Graham then laid off Andrew Barrowman in the right hand corner of the box, and his low drive across goal found the net. Final score 1\u20132</", "The visitors started strongly, on a day with hollowing gales swirling through the stadium, with some early chances. Rory Fallon just failed to make contact with a low cross and Josh Magennis somehow failed to score in a goalmouth scramble. He then vented his anger by shoving the home keeper in the chest and full in the face. However, the referee inexplicably decided that the violent conduct from him merited only a yellow card. The home fans were even more infuriated when Paul Willis tried to take a quick free-kick, and apparently was deemed to have committed an equal offence as Magennis, so was yellow carded for his effort. Andy Kirk should have hit the target with a turning snap-shot, and David Graham was also guilty of missing the target with a close range diving header after an excellent move by Dufermline. Aberdeen were looking dangerous from set-pieces and deservedly took the lead right on half-time with a header by Andrew Considine from a Fraser Fyvie corner. Paddy Boyle was then lucky to escape with a yellow after his two-footed challenge on Fyvie. Dunfermline then equalised from a Graham corner, Andrew Barrowman's header was blocked on the line, but he was first on hand to put away the rebound. Then, from Willis's superb diagonal ball, Graham cut inside from the left and rifled inside the near post of David Gonzalez to take the lead. Aberdeen nearly stuck back straight away with Youl Mawene keeping the ball away from Paul Gallacher and cutting it back, only for Magennis to miss the target with no keeper in the goal. Boyle did well to turn past the defenders and force in shot which was parried to Liam Buchanan, whose first touch coming on as a sub was to make it 3\u20131. Immediately from the restart Gallacher saved one-on-one with Magennis, showing Aberdeen could score again. From a quick Martin Hardie free-kick, Buchanan cut the ball back and Barrowman looked odds on the score, only for Gonzalez to somehow tip his point blank range onto the post. Straight away Aberdeen won a corner and from it Alex Keddie headed in an own goal. From then on it was all Aberdeen, and the visitors final scored a fourth. From a long throw-in Magennis managed to turn a smash home the equaliser. Final score 3\u20133.</", "| Andrew Barrowman", "|Andrew Barrowman", "| Andrew Barrowman"]}]}}
