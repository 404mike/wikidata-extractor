He had debuted in 1919 for Hampshire and played two seasons for the county. In 1921 he joined the Lancashire Leagues and impressed the Glamorgan recruiters who signed him up for the following summer.\nIn a game against Derbyshire during the 1925 season he took his career best figures of 8 for 41 to finish the year with 133 wickets. It was one of five years that he managed to take 100 wickets and the total set a Glamorgan record for most wickets in a county season until it was surpassed four years later by Jack Mercer.\nRyan's career was overshadowed at times by his controversial off-field persona, particularly his heavy drinking.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Frank Ryan || 913"]}, {"page": "Frank Ryan", "response": ["Frank Ryan may refer to:", "*Frank Ryan (cricketer) (1888\u20131954), English cricketer", "*Frank Ryan (sportscaster) (1899\u20131961), publicity director and sports announcer", "*Frank Ryan (tenor) (1900\u20131965), Irish opera singer", "*Frank Ryan (Irish republican) (1902\u20131944), member of the Irish Republican Army and the Republican Congress", "*Frank Ryan (Australian footballer) (1932\u20132011), Australian rules footballer for Richmond", "*Frank Ryan (mayor) (1932\u20132017), New Zealand politician, mayor of Mount Albert", "*Frank Ryan (American football) (born 1936), retired American football quarterback and mathematician", "*Frank Ryan (gangster) (1942\u20131984), Canadian mobster", "*Frank Ryan (politician) (born 1951), member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives", "*Frank Ryan (surgeon) (1960\u20132010), American plastic surgeon"]}, {"page": "Percy Evans", "response": ["Evans made a significant contribution, when on debut against Glamorgan he took 3-84, dismissing Dai Davies, Frank Ryan and Dennis Sullivan."]}, {"page": "Victor Jarvis", "response": ["Jarvis made his first-class debut for Essex against Glamorgan in the 1925 County Championship.
