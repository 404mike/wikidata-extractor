In 1927, H.K. Ayliff directed a modern dress production at the Garrick Theatre in New York, with Mary Ellis and Basil Sydney. At the time, modern dress productions were still rare enough to elicit a great deal of attention, and the production ran for 175 performances, a record for the theatre at the time.  The production was remounted in England in 1928, first at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, and subsequently at the Royal Court Theatre, starring Eileen Beldon and Scott Sunderland. In this production, the Induction was kept, with Sly moving from the front of the stage to one of the boxes after the first act. Barry Jackson, who co-directed the Birmingham performances, was initially keen to use the epilogue from A Shrew, but he ultimately decided against it \"because the actual words in the old edition are so corrupt as to be illiterate.\" In a 1935 production starring Catherine Lacey and Neil Porter, director Ben Iden Payne became the first to use the A Shrew epilogue in a performance of The Shrew at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, with Roy Byford initially playing Sly, followed by Jay Laurier. Both actors received excellent reviews for their performances."]}, {"page": "Mark Melford", "response": ["thumb|right|alt=Ethel MelfordOn 9 May 1887 he married Ethel Byford, an actress and sister of Roy Byford, also an actor.
