Novak won the golden boot award and was bought by League One side Huddersfield Town for a fee that has brought Gateshead a North East non-league record fee of \u00a3150,000. His team retained their Conference National status in 2009\u201310, finishing above the relegation zone on goal difference (though this was later made into a two-point gap after Salisbury City were expelled from the division). On 28 April 2010, Bogie signed a new two-year contract which made him Gateshead's first full-time manager in over half a century. Under his charge the \"Tynesiders\" posted a 14th-place finish in 2010\u201311, reaching the semi-final of the FA Trophy and winning the Durham Challenge Cup. Gateshead pushed on again in 2011\u201312, flirting around the play-off spots all season before finishing in eighth position; they also reached the FA Cup second round and the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy. He signed a one-year extension to his contract in May 2012. He then lost top-scorer Jon Shaw to Luton Town, and attempted to replace him with former Hartlepool United stalwart James Brown. He further signed defender Glenn Wilson, goalkeeper Adam Bartlett, attacker Ryan Donaldson, and defender Chris Bush. However, after opening the 2012\u201313 season with six leagues without defeat, Gateshead struggled with poor form. On 10 December 2012, Bogie and assistant Terry Mitchell were relieved of their duties at the club."]}, {"page": "Luke Prosser", "response": ["Prosser made 31 and 33 appearances respectively in the two following seasons as Southend twice reached the play-offs, faltering at the semi-final stage during the 2013\u201314 season but reaching the final in the 2014\u201315 campaign. During the season, he was knocked unconscious by a free kick from Cambridge United's Ryan Donaldson on 21 March 2015. He was an unused substitute in the play-off final as Southend beat Wycombe Wanderers to earn promotion to League One on 23 May 2015. Northampton Town were keen to sign Prosser ahead of the 2015\u201316 season, but had a transfer bid rejected in June 2015. Prosser was named in the Football League team of the week for his performance in a 1\u20130 win over former club Port Vale at Roots Hall on 10 October 2015. However, he found himself out of favour at Southend, and on 28 January 2016, he joined Northampton on loan until the end of the season. He helped Northampton to the League Two title as he made eight league appearances. He was not offered a new contract to remain with his parent club, and he was released by Southend in May 2016."]}, {"page": "Ryan (given name)", "response": ["*Ryan Donaldson (born 1991), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Haris Vu\u010dki\u0107", "response": ["Vu\u010dki\u0107 scored his first senior goal for Newcastle against Carlisle United in a friendly on 17 July 2010 with a curled effort into the bottom left hand corner.
