Whiteside also lends his name to the Norman Whiteside Sports Facility, a community sports area used by Woodvale F.C.

In this time, he brought players such as George O'Boyle and record-signing Istvan Kozma to the club. His greatest success was keeping the club in the Premier Division at the end of the season. At the end of the campaign though, it was suggested that Leishman move from the dugout to the board-room with the club's suggestion that he take up the role of general manager. As a keen manager, he resisted the offer and left his post acrimoniously in July 1990. The move shocked the Pars' support and 4,000 fans marched on the club demanding his reinstatement as manager."]}, {"page": "Carnoustie Panmure F.C.", "response": ["* George O'Boyle"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland national football B team", "response": ["|| 10 May 1994      || England B      || 2-4 || Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield || George O'Boyle, James Quinn", "|| 11 February 1998 || Republic of Ireland B || 1-0 || Tolka Park, Dublin || George O'Boyle", "*George O'Boyle"]}, {"page": "1967 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*14 December - George O'Boyle, footballer."]}, {"page": "List of St Johnstone F.C. seasons", "response": ["|George O'Boyle", "|George O'Boyle", "|George O'Boyle"]}, {"page": "Nathan Lowndes", "response": ["In 1998, he joined Scottish club St Johnstone, who were in their second season back in the Premier League. In his first season in Perth, he helped \"Saints\" to a third-place finish (which qualified them for the following season's UEFA Cup), an appearance in the League Cup final, and the last four of the Scottish Cup. In the final of the League Cup at Celtic Park he was a late substitute for George O'Boyle, as Rangers celebrated a 2\u20131 win. He was the club's top scorer in 1999\u20132000 with eleven goals, which included a goal in the preliminary rounds of the UEFA Cup that helped the club reach a first round tie with AS Monaco. After the first leg the striker told of how opponent Marco Simone came into the away dressing room and asked Lowndes for a signed shirt. Despite the striker's individual fortunes the club could not replicate the success of the previous campaign. He made just twelve appearances in the 2000\u201301 season, as the club flirted with relegation. In his three years at McDiarmid Park Lowndes made 63 appearances and scored fourteen goals. In May 2001, Lowndes signed for Livingston, for whom he made 21 appearances and scored three goals. Livingston enjoyed a highly successful season, finishing the league campaign in third place."]}]}}
