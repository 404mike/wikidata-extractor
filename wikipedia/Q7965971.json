He signed professional forms in 1940 and due to his wartime occupation as a physical training instructor he remained local and made the left back spot his own from 1942\u201343 onwards, missing only one game from February 1943 to May 1945. The left-footed McCue's style was uncompromising, described as a 'grand kicker of the ball' and should an opposing winger get the better of him he would not averse the odd kick or two to rectify the situation. This earned him the nickname 'chopper' amongst his Stoke teammates. His impetuous tackling did lead to mistakes and a one such occasion McCue slipped as the attempted to tackle Sheffield United's Walter Rickett on the final day of the 1946\u201347 season, Stoke lost 2\u20131 and missed out on their first league title."]}]}}
