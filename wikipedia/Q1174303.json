She supervised the 1955 PhD thesis of David Edmunds, who later won the P\u00f3lya Prize. Together with Roy Chisholm, Morris wrote a textbook on Mathematical Methods in Physics. Although it was lacking in rigour, it was reprinted several times, and, according to Chisholm, \"in the late 1960's, North-Holland told us that we had broken their publication record for technical books. We even made a little money.\" In the 1970s, while she was a Reader in Fluid Dynamics, she served as one of the first female heads of a mathematics department in the UK, possibly the first at a university."]}]}}
