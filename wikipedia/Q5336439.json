He turned professional on 27 September 1963 and was immediately called up to the first team squad for the away match at Ipswich Town the following day. Eddie Readfern was unable to participate in the game due to illness, which meant that Brown was given his league debut, just a few days before his 18th birthday; his equalising goal helped Albion to a 2\u20131 away win.Brown, Homer & Willmore pp16\u201317. Readfern was recalled for the next game however, meaning that Brown immediately returned to the reserves, although Brown did return to the first team in mid-October, when he scored on his home debut which Albion went on to win 4\u20133 against Aston Villa.Brown, Homer & Willmore p18. He was selected sporadically by Albion manager Jimmy Hagan during the remainder of 1963\u201364 and finished the campaign on five goals in thirteen appearances.Matthews (2007) pp304\u2013305. In the latter part of the season he missed four league games when he was called up to the England Youth squad for the UEFA European Youth Tournament in the Netherlands. England won the competition but Brown was not selected for any of the games.Brown, Homer & Willmore p19. Brown became a regular first team player during the early part of the 1964\u201365 campaign, appearing in Albion's first 12 league games of the season. During this period he scored six goals,Matthews (2007) pp306\u2013307. including his first professional hat-trick, which came in a 4\u20131 win against Sunderland. However he lost his place shortly after the signing of Jeff Astle and played just five more games that season.Brown, Homer & Willmore p21. A desire to play first team football led him to submit a transfer request, which Jimmy Hagan turned down, but Brown continued his scoring run in the reserve team, hitting 22 goals in 20 games.Brown, Homer & Willmore pp21\u201322."]}]}}
