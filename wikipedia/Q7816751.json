The club made a poor start to the 1978-79 season, failing to win their first six league encounters. Despite this however, they recorded victories against Juventus and PSV Eindhoven in the European Cup, with Cooper failing to be selected for the ties by Greig. A mixed season domestically followed and they had all but lost the title in a 4\u20132 away defeat to Celtic on 21 May 1979. Describing losing the championship, Cooper said \"you just want to emigrate as soon as you have got changed and walked out of the ground. It is like a spectre which haunts you for weeks.\" Despite this, Rangers won the 1979 Scottish League Cup Final in a 2\u20131 victory against Aberdeen and were victorious in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final, winning 3\u20132 over Hibernian. Tensions were beginning to rise between Cooper and Greig, mainly due to less-frequent selection of Cooper by the new manager. Cooper would often return home to Hamilton complaining the club he loved was \"kicking him in the teeth\". That season, Cooper made 49 appearances and scored ten goals. On 4 August 1979, Cooper scored a memorable solo goal against Celtic in the 1979 Drybrough Cup Final at Hampden. A crossed ball in from Alex MacDonald met Cooper at the edge of the box, where he went on to \"keepie up\" the ball over Roddie MacDonald, Murdo MacLeod, Tom McAdam and Alan Sneddon before slotting the ball past onrushing Celtic goalkeeper Peter Latchford. The goal was voted the greatest ever Rangers goal by Rangers fans and listed by The Guardian's Rob Smyth as the second greatest ever solo goal, after Diego Maradona's Goal of the Century. Sandy Jardine, who had scored a spectacular second goal for Rangers during the match, admitted his goal had been overshadowed by Cooper's. \"I scored one of my best goals that day,\" said Jardine, \"and it hardly got a mention.\""]}, {"page": "List of Dundee United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["| 1975 || align=left|  Tom McAdam ||align=left|  Dumbarton || \u00a340,000 || \u00a3287,200"]}, {"page": "Template talk:WikiProject Biography/Missing", "response": ["*Tom McAdam"]}, {"page": "Celtic F.C. in European football", "response": ["The 1983\u201384 season saw Celtic competing in the UEFA Cup.

The first leg away in Lisbon on 19 October saw Celtic start brightly but fade very quickly, and were fortunate to lose only 2\u20130. Manager Davie Hay admitted Celtic were \"lucky\" to not concede more goals, although he insisted that whilst they were in an \"awkward position\" to salvage the tie, it was not \"impossible\". Celtic's response two weeks later in the return match in Glasgow saw them produce a performance described by The Herald as \"quite brilliant\". Tommy Burns ran the show for Celtic and opened the scoring on 17 minutes with a headed goal. Shortly before half-time, Tom McAdam levelled the tie with a powerful shot. On half-time, Brian McClair took a pass from Frank McGarvey, ran 30 yards before shooting in to put Celtic ahead on aggregate. Further goals in the second half from Murdo MacLeod and McGarvey sealed an emphatic 5\u20130 win on the night, and progression to the third round. Having replaced Billy McNeill as manager in the summer, Davie Hay described the win as \"the best performance since I took over\". Celtic's next opponents were Nottingham Forest, and a scoreless draw away in the first leg put them in a strong position. Celtic dominated the match, with Forest manager Brian Clough acknowledging that Celtic \"played really well\" and had been \"the best team on the night\".
