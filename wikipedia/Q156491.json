Tyler came to prominence with the release of her 1977 album The World Starts Tonight and its singles \"Lost in France\" and \"More Than a Lover\". Her 1978 single \"It's a Heartache\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, and number three on the US Billboard Hot 100.\nIn the 1980s, Tyler ventured into rock music with songwriter and producer Jim Steinman. He wrote Tyler's biggest hit \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\", the lead single from her 1983 UK chart-topping album Faster Than the Speed of Night. Steinman also wrote Tyler's other major 1980s hit \"Holding Out for a Hero\". She had success in mainland Europe during the 1990s with Dieter Bohlen, who wrote and produced her hit \"Bitterblue\". In 2003, Tyler re-recorded \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" with singer Kareen Antonn. Their bilingual duet, titled \"Si demain... (Turn Around)\", topped the French charts.\nRocks and Honey was released in 2013 and features the single \"Believe in Me\", which she performed representing the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. After reuniting with the producer David Mackay, she released Between the Earth and the Stars (2019) and The Best Is Yet to Come (2021).\nBoth \"It's a Heartache\" and \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" are among the best-selling singles of all time, with sales in excess of six million each.

Many British singers who performed the occasional country songs are of other genres. Tom Jones, by this point near the end of his peak success as a pop singer, had a string of country hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Bee Gees had some fleeting success in the genre, with one country hit as artists (\"Rest Your Love on Me\") and a major hit as songwriters (\"Islands in the Stream\"); Barry Gibb, the band's usual lead singer and last surviving member, acknowledged that country music was a major influence on the band's style. Singer Engelbert Humperdinck, while charting only once in the U.S. country top 40 with \"After the Lovin',\" achieved widespread success on both the U.S. and UK pop charts with his covers of Nashville country ballads such as \"Release Me,\" \"Am I That Easy to Forget\" and \"There Goes My Everything.\" The songwriting tandem of Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway wrote a number of country hits, in addition to their widespread success in pop songwriting; Cook is notable for being the only Briton to be inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler initially started her career making country records, and in 1978 her single \"It's a Heartache\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.
