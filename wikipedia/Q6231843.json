He was unable to attend either Oxford or the University of Cambridge owing to the religious tests that effectively barred him. Lister decided to attend the non-sectarian University College London Medical School, one of only a few institutions which accepted Quakers at that time. He initially studied arts, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree with honours in classics and botany in 1847. While he was studying, Lister suffered from a bout of smallpox, a year after his elder brother died of the disease. The bereavement combined with the stress of his classes led to a nervous breakdown. Lister decided to take a long holiday in Ireland, to recuperate and this delayed the start of his medical studies at the university. In October 1848, Lister registered as a medical student. While a student, Lister developed a lifelong interest in histology and experimental physiology.  During his studies, Lister was active in the University Debating Society and the Hospital Medical Society. His main lecturers were John Lindley, Thomas Graham, Robert Edmond Grant, George Viner Ellis and William Benjamin Carpenter but although Lister often spoke about Lindley and Graham in his writings, it was Wharton Jones and William Sharpey who exercised the greatest influence on Lister. As part of his studies, Lister trained first as an intern and then house physician to Walter Hayle Walshe. Then in 1851, in his second year, Lister became a house surgeon, i.e., a dresser, to John Eric Erichsen. It was while Lister worked for Erichsen that his interest in the healing of wounds began."]}, {"page": "Royal College of Surgeons of England", "response": ["| John Eric Erichsen || 1880"]}, {"page": "Railway spine", "response": ["The first full length medical study of the condition was John Eric Erichsen's classic book, On Railway and Other Injuries of the Nervous System.

Sometimes, these were entirely contrived \"accidents\" by confidence tricksters; more commonly, however, they were exaggerations of the results of a genuine accident.  In 1906, railway surgeon Willis King claimed that 96% of claimants were actually malingering.Dembe, p. 229  One common claim that was hotly debated by railway surgeons was the condition known as railway spine.  Over a hundred papers were published on the subject in the medical literature for the period 1866\u20131890.Dembe, p. 230  In this condition, the patient reports cerebral symptoms such as headache or loss of memory, but there is no visible damage to the spine.  It was first described by Danish-British surgeon John Eric Erichsen.  Erichsen believed the condition was physiological, due to inflammation of the spinal cord.  He compared it to meningitis which had similar symptoms and a similar cause.  Others, such as Herbert W. Page (surgeon to the London and North Western Railway), argued that it was psychological, or else, like Arthur Dean Bevan (1918 president of the American Medical Association), outright faked.  Railway surgeons were generally skeptical of the condition and disliked the implication that there was an injury peculiar to railways.  British surgeon Edwin Morris described the term as \"most reprehensible\".Morris, p. 48  Bevan claimed to have cured one patient in ten minutes by standing him up and speaking to him forcefully."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| John Eric Erichsen||01/06/1876||19 July 1818 \u2013 23 September 1896"]}, {"page": "Erichsen baronets", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Eric Erichsen"]}, {"page": "Sir John Eric Erichsen, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Eric Erichsen"]}, {"page": "Watkin Williams (Liberal politician)", "response": ["Williams was the eldest son of Peter Williams, rector of Llansannan, Denbighshire, and his wife Lydia Sophia Price, daughter of the Rev.

Philpott slept in the bedroom beside Cancellor's and had reported hearing no unusual noises or screams from Cancellor's room on the night of his death.

Although the original anatomical explanation of hysteria, the so-called wandering womb, was by this point abandoned, the diagnoses remained associated with (gender stereotypes of) females and female sexuality in the minds of physicians. Hysteria was joined in 1866 by a diagnosis for a very similar set of symptoms: railway spine, a nervous disorder caused by witnessing the accidents that the dangerous railways of the time generated in large numbers. John Eric Erichsen, who first diagnosed railway spine, explicitly rejected the hysteria diagnosis for his patients, arguing that diagnosing men with hysteria was unreasonable, \"this term [being] employed merely to cloak a want of precise knowledge as to the real pathological state\". Herbert Page, by contrast, argued for the hysteria label, finding what Erichsen called railway spine a functional disorder that was too similar to hysteria to warrant a separate diagnosis."]}, {"page": "Fear of trains", "response": ["Another source of fear in the early days of railway travel was travelers' isolation from the outside world, as well as the confinement in a small compartment, rendering a person who became sick or subject to crime, helpless. \"...The loudest screams are swallowed up by the roar of the rapidly revolving wheels...\".As cited by W. Schivelbusch, p. 79 This kind of fear, as well as actual crimes committed in trains, were often a matter of newspaper publications of the times.W. Schivelbusch, pp. 79-83 After a number of prominent cases this fear was elevated to the level of collective psychosis.W.
