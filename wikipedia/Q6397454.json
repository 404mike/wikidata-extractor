He played over 300 games in the Football League for six different clubs.\nStarting his career with Newcastle United in 1984, he spent ten years with the club, playing as captain as the club won the First Division title in 1992\u201393. A big money move to Tottenham Hotspur followed in February 1994. However, he did not settle at the club, and instead spent the majority of his three years at the club on loan at Port Vale, Charlton Athletic and Norwich City. He made the move to Norwich permanent in 1997, spending two years at the club before leaving the professional game in 1999, shortly after a loan spell with Darlington.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Easington, County Durham", "response": ["*Kevin Scott \u2013 Newcastle United footballer"]}, {"page": "Craig Bellamy", "response": ["As a young player, Bellamy was unafraid to voice his opinion to more senior members of the squad. His approach annoyed some teammates who sought retribution during training sessions; Bellamy later commented, \"one or two of them would try to clean me out with flying tackles. They wanted to bring me down a peg or two.\" One training session left him \"nearly in tears\" after Kevin Scott repeatedly singled him out. Bellamy won support from his midfield partner, the experienced Peter Grant, who struck up a friendship with Bellamy. Bruce Rioch was appointed Norwich manager in 1998 and instantly moved Bellamy from central midfield to attack. The decision reaped rewards immediately; Bellamy scored seven goals in his first eight league appearances of the campaign, including his first career hat-trick on 22 August 1998 in a 4\u20132 home win over Queens Park Rangers. By November, he was one of the leading goalscorers in the First Division and was rewarded with a new five-year contract."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Kevin Scott||||CB||1986\u20131994||227||8||", "| Kevin Scott || 1991\u20131992"]}, {"page": "Myrtle Beach Boyz", "response": ["*Kevin Scott (NC State) "]}, {"page": "Kevin Scott", "response": ["Kevin Scott may refer to:", "* Kevin Scott (speed skater) (born 1969), Canadian speed skater", "* Kevin Scott (footballer) (born 1966), English footballer", "* Kevin Scott (American football) (born 1969), former American football cornerback ", "* Kevin Scott (Canadian football) (born 1983), Canadian football long snapper and defensive lineman ", "* Kevin Scott (badminton) (born 1965), Scottish badminton player ", "* Kevin Scott (computer scientist) (born 1972), Chief Technology Officer at Microsoft "]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Middlesbrough F.C. season", "response": ["|Academy coach                 || Kevin Scott"]}, {"page": "Jeroen Boere", "response": ["A tall striker, Jeroen Boere went abroad in summer 1993 when he was signed by Billy Bonds for \u00a3250,000 to play for newly promoted West Ham United in the Premier League.

In September only Lee Glover, Tony Naylor and Martin Foyle could find the net, but the Vale won six points from their five games. To help with his recovery from a serious injury, Ray Walker spent some time on loan at Cambridge United, and won back his first team place in the Vale starting eleven upon his return. Meanwhile, Tony Kelly arrived at the club from Bolton Wanderers, but after a brief spell moved on to Millwall. Vale's poor attack was highlighted in October, though the defence ensured three draws from five games. In November, Darren Hughes was allowed to leave the club for Northampton Town. Rudge decided to make another big signing, and bought winger Steve Guppy from Newcastle United for \u00a3225,000. On 5 November, Vale lost all their inhibitions in front of goal, beating Southend United 5\u20130 with five different scorers. However their draw with Swindon Town would prove to be the only point gained in December, as Vale were stuck in a relegation dogfight. John Jeffers spent January on loan at Shrewsbury Town. During this spell defender Kevin Scott arrived on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. The team gelled, forming a five-game unbeaten run based on just two goals conceded to shoot up the table. In March, midfielder Ian Bogie was signed from Leyton Orient for a \u00a350,000 fee. Potteries derby day finally came on 14 March, and 19,510 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 1\u20131 draw with Stoke City, Naylor scoring the Vale's goal. Five defeats in seven games followed, raising concerns of the drop. However the Vale were unbeaten in their final five games to ensure safety. This included a 3\u20133 draw at Elm Park that saw the \"Valiants\" come from three goals down to claim a point. It also included a 1\u20130 win over Stoke at the Victoria Ground on 22 April, Foyle scoring the goal.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Kevin Scott", "|\u2013||DF||||Kevin Scott||1||0||0||1", "| January 1995 || DF ||  || Kevin Scott || Tottenham Hotspur || End of season || "]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Kevin Scott"]}]}}
