She made her junior international debut at the age of 14. She read physics at Oxford University, where she succeeded in combining her academic pursuits with her interests in bridge, athletics and korfball.\nAt the age of 22, Norton formed a bridge partnership with Bryony Youngs. They were part of an England team which won the Lady Milne Trophy, but their partnership disbanded when Youngs moved to the USA to continue her studies. Norton then formed a partnership with Fiona Brown, in which she has had her greatest successes.\nNorton has always been a non-professional player, whose bridge career is secondary to her professional career and to her family life. She married in June 2015, and gave birth to a daughter in April 2016. As of 2017, she is a director of a company which markets and distributes products to the veterinary and animal healthcare sectors, and is taking a break from international and 'high level' bridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coventry and North Warwickshire Sports Club", "response": ["* Susan Norton (), English bridge international and world champion English Bridge Union biography of Susan Stockdale.
