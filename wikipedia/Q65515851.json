Andover was sent into training with John Day at Danebury in Hampshire and ridden in most of his races by Alfred Day, his trainer's younger brother."]}, {"page": "Virago (horse)", "response": ["Virago, a dark chestnut filly with one white foot who stood 16 hands high, was bred, like the Derby winner Voltigeur, by Robert Stephenson at his stud at Hart, near Hartlepool, County Durham. Virago was described as \"more racing-looking than handsome\" and having a \"quiet and docile\" temperament. As a yearling, she was bought for either \u00a3300, \u00a3350 or \u00a3460 (sources differ) at the Doncaster sales by Henry Padwick, a notorious moneylender who used the name \"Mr. Howard\" for his racing interests, with John Scott as the underbidder. John Barham Day, who was ironically known as \"Honest John\", trained the filly at Padwick's stable at Findon, West Sussex. According to his son William, later a successful trainer in his own right, Day believed that he had acquired \"the finest yearling in the world\"."]}, {"page": "John Barham Day", "response": ["In 1847 Day left Danebury to become the private trainer to Henry Padwick at Michel Grove near Findon in West Sussex. For Padwick, Day trained Virago, whom he considered the best horse he ever handled. Day deliberately prevented the filly from showing her true form in order to secure a light weight in handicap races, and then landed a huge betting coup when the filly captured the Great Metropolitan Handicap and the City and Suburban Handicap on the same day at Epsom in 1854. The relationship with Padwick ended in the following year when the owner was unhappy with the preparation given to his colt St Hubert, the beaten favourite for the 2000 Guineas. The winner of the race was trained by Day's son and Padwick suspected collusion between the family members."]}, {"page": "William Day (horseman)", "response": ["In 1855, the Day family appeared to have three of the best three-year-old colts in England: William trained Lord of the Isles for James Merry, his father trained Henry Padwick's St Hubert, while John, Jr.'s classic candidate was a colt named Kingstown. According to one version of events, William and John Sr. came to an arrangement whereby Lord of the Isles would be allowed to win the 2000 Guineas, but would not be trained seriously for the Derby, while the reverse would apply to St Hubert. Lord of the Isles duly gave Day his first classic winner in the Guineas, but when Henry Padwick discovered the arrangement, he sacked John Barham Day, effectively ending his training career. When St Hubert was withdrawn from the Derby, the Day family were forced to rely on Kingstown and Lord of the Isles, despite the fact that the latter had hardly been trained since the Guineas. Both William and John Jr. were strongly suspected of involvement in a series of plots to \"nobble\" the other leading fancy Wild Dayrell, who nevertheless won the race, with Kingstown second and Lord of the Isles third. Merry removed all his horses from Day's stable, but the Jockey Club on this occasion took no action. In his memoirs, Day denied any wrongdoing, insisting that Lord of the Isles had never been regarded as a Derby horse and only ran at the insistence of the owner. He explained the horse's lack of condition to his contracting a respiratory condition shortly before the race."]}, {"page": "John Day (horseman)", "response": ["In 1846, John Barham Day moved away from Danebury to take up a post as private trainer to Henry Padwick, leaving John Jr. to take over the Danebury stable. In his first year as a trainer he sent out Pyrrhus The First to win the Derby and won both the 1000 Guineas and Oaks with the filly Mendicant. Both horses were owned by John Gully for whom he later trained The Hermit and Andover to win the 2000 Guineas and Derby respectively in 1854."]}]}}
