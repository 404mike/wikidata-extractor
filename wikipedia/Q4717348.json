He made his Luton debut in a 1\u20131 draw with Oxford United one week later. Hall retained his place in the starting lineup for the next match, a 2\u20132 draw with York City three days later. However, he was dropped to the bench and remained an unused substitute during a 1\u20130 home win over Carlisle United. Hall replaced Matt Robinson has a half-time substitute during a 1\u20130 away defeat to Mansfield Town on 17 February 2015. Subsequent to the match, Hall picked up an injury which ruled him out for over a month, before later returning to training. To build up his match fitness, Hall twice completed 90 minutes for the development squad, firstly in a 3\u20131 defeat to Cambridge United on 18 March 2015, followed by a 5\u20132 win over Portsmouth on 31 March 2015. Hall returned to first-team action on 6 April 2015, playing for 74 minutes in a 1\u20130 away win over Tranmere Rovers, before being replaced by Alex Lawless. He went on to make a further three appearances to end the 2014\u201315 season having made seven league appearances for Luton.", "Hall began the 2015\u201316 season by playing the full 90 minutes in a 3\u20132 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 22 August 2015. Three days later, he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu as Luton took Premier League club Stoke City to a penalty shoot-out in a League Cup second round fixture, only to lose 8\u20137 on penalties after the match ended 1\u20131 after extra-time. During a 2\u20131 home defeat to Plymouth Argyle on 24 October 2015, Hall received two yellow cards within a couple of minutes of each other and was subsequently sent off. However, this caused some confusion because it wasn't made clear in the aftermath of the first incident that Hall had been a shown a yellow card, thus he wasn't expecting a subsequent red card following the second incident. This led to an apology from the Football Association after Luton sought clarification from both them and the referee which determined that the referee did not make it clear who received the yellow card in the first incident, but Hall would still be suspended for the next fixture against Dagenham & Redbridge. Hall's next appearance was during a 4\u20133 home defeat to Northampton Town, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute for Sean Long, a result which led to the sacking of manager John Still. He featured twice under caretaker manager Andy Awford, in a 0\u20130 draw with Portsmouth on 28 December 2015, followed by a 2\u20130 away defeat to Bristol Rovers five days later. Hall also featured in the first match under new Luton manager Nathan Jones, a 0\u20130 draw with Cambridge United two weeks later, but went off with a foot injury after 65 minutes and was replaced by Paddy McCourt. He returned to the matchday squad for a home fixture against Hartlepool United on 20 February 2016, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Alex Lawless during a 2\u20131 win. However, a succession of injuries ruled him out for the rest of the season, after which Luton announced he would be released upon the expiry of his contract, a decision manager Nathan Jones described as 'logical' as a result of missing a significant amount of training and a lack of game time."]}, {"page": "Richard Pacquette", "response": ["His cousin is fellow Dominica international footballer Jefferson Louis, with whom he was paired as Dominica's strikers in the second leg against Barbados.
