He was the owner of the mines in the Aberford and Garforth area and the Lotherton Hall Estate in Aberford.\nHe died either 13 and 20 October 1809 when he suffered a fatal accident whilst hunting. He was buried on 28 October 1809 at Barwick-in-Elmet and over 2,000 people and over 400 of his father's tenants attended his funeral. Lotherton passed to his niece Elizabeth Oliver Gascoigne, who had married Frederick Mason Trench, 2nd Baron Ashtown. Thomas had predeceased his father, who died the following year, and so Parlington Hall passed instead to his step-sister Mary, who had married Richard Oliver of County Limerick.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of women who died in childbirth", "response": ["* Lady Mary Turner, n\u00e9e Shuttleworth (1786), only wife of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th Baronet & mother of Thomas Gascoigne Jr"]}, {"page": "Thomas Gascoigne", "response": ["Thomas Gascoigne may refer to:", "* Thomas Gascoigne (academic) (1404\u20131458), vice-chancellor of Oxford University", "* Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 2nd Baronet (1596\u20131686)", "* Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th Baronet (1745\u20131810)", "* Thomas Gascoigne (businessman) (1786\u20131809), British mine owner", "* Thomas Gascoigne (footballer) (1899\u20131991), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Gascoigne (businessperson)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Gascoigne (businessman)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Charles Gascoigne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Gascoigne (businessman)"]}]}}
