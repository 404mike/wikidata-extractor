Kerrigan wanted the film to be as realistic as possible in depicting young people's lives in contemporary Britain, as well as realistically portraying drug culture and club culture, both walks of life in which Kerrigan had experience. Kerrigan based much of the film on his own exploits, and eventually took over in a director capacity. In an edition of UK gay lifestyle magazine Attitude, actor Danny Dyer spoke about the film being partly inspired by the 1995 BBC television drama Loved Up (which also featured an early appearance from Lena Headey), and which had similar themes to the film."]}, {"page": "53rd British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Human Traffic \u2013 Justin Kerrigan (Writer/Director)"]}, {"page": "Fairwater, Cardiff", "response": ["Fairwater has two secondary schools.
