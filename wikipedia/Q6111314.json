He won the British heavyweight championship in 1969, before losing it to Henry Cooper in his first defence. Bodell regained the title a year later by outpointing Joe Bugner. He lost the European title in 1971 after a defeat by Spaniard Jos\u00e9 Manuel Urta\u00edn, and after losing both his British and Commonwealth titles to a second-round knockout by Danny McAlinden in June 1972, he retired from professional boxing.\nAmong his other notable fights were a first-round knockout loss to Jerry Quarry after just 64 seconds, and a points win over future world title contender Jos\u00e9 Roman. Bodell's final record was 58 wins (including 31 by knockout) and 13 losses.

He focused on television roles during this period, appearing on a number of television shows. In June, 1971, he returned to start another streak of wins. Noteworthy among them was a revenge of his earlier draw against tall Tony Doyle at the Playboy Club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with a lopsided decision. He then KO'd British and European champion Jack Bodell in the first round. That fight was held in London. His second fight there during this streak was against Larry Middleton. Middleton was the kind of tall, quick boxer with long reach who often gave Quarry trouble in bouts. Quarry won a very narrow, controversial decision against Middleton.
