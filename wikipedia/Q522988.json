He is the longest-serving drummer in Oasis's history, performing on four studio albums and one song on Don't Believe The Truth, two compilation albums, and one live album during his tenure. He joined the band in April 1995 after the band's original drummer Tony McCarroll was removed. He was recommended to Noel Gallagher by Gallagher's friend Paul Weller. Notably, Alan's brother, Steve, had been a longtime drummer for Weller.

Spending ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? was also an international chart success, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time. In addition, it stands as the fifth-best-selling album in the UK, and the biggest-selling album in the UK of the 1990s.

The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: \"I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't have been able to drum the new songs\". McCarroll was replaced by Alan White, formerly of Starclub and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist Steve White and recommended to Noel by Paul Weller.
