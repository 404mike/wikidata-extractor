He is winner of the Platinum and Bronze Koestler Awards 2012 for his poetry.He was arrested at his family home in London, UK on 19 July 2006 in response to a request from the United States under the US\u2013UK Extradition Act 2003, and detained without trial or charge over 6 years before his extradition to the United States on 5 October 2012. He was accused of associations with an allegedly terrorism-related Islamic news media website and London-based publishing house from 1997 to 2004 about Bosnia, the Chechen Independence War and Afghanistan Islamic Emirate government.\nOn 10 December 2013, in U.S. District Court in New Haven, Connecticut he entered into a plea bargain with the US Government prosecutor to charges of conspiracy to provide and providing material support for militants in Chechnya and Afghanistan. All other charges were dismissed. The length of Talha's detention without trial or charge is among the longest in British legal history.\nHe is also the translator of a tenth-century Arabic poem, \"Above the Dust\", by Syrian Abu Firas Al-Hamdani, on his captivity in Byzantium.The Talha Ahsan extradition case raised controversy due to comparison with the treatment of Gary McKinnon, whose extradition \u2013 which was expected to be 10 days after Ahsan's \u2013 was stalled after a medical diagnosis of Asperger syndrome and associative risks, similar to a diagnosis given to Ahsan. This has led to accusations from mainstream UK media, human rights NGOs and religious groups of a racist double standard within Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May's application of the law.After being detained without trial for six years, with appeals to the European Court of Human Rights, the House of Lords and the UK High Court, Ahsan was extradited from the UK to the US on 5 October 2012, where he initially pleaded not guilty to all charges against him at a federal district court hearing in New Haven, Connecticut. He was held while awaiting trial in solitary confinement at the Northern Correctional Institution, a Supermax state prison in Somers, Connecticut, United States. His US trial proceedings began in October 2013. On 10 December 2013, he changed his plea to guilty to the charge of providing material support to terrorists.An international campaign led by Talha's brother Hamja Ahsan was formed to halt his extradition to the US and have him tried in the UK on the basis that this is where he was present during the period of the allegation. This was supported by a wide coalition of figures including Noam Chomsky, Robert Hillary King (Angola Three), A. L. Kennedy, Stop the War, Bruce Kent, Plaid Cymru, his MP and Labour cabinet member Sadiq Khan, Caroline Lucas MP, Gerry Conlon, the Muslim Council of Britain, actor Riz Ahmed, and former extradited Britons David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew of the NatWest Three. The family-run campaign continues around issues of solitary confinement and reforming extradition law, with the aim of repatriating Talha to the UK. The campaign also curates events around prison literature, especially poetry.\nThe Free Talha Ahsan family campaign was short-listed for a Liberty Human Rights Award in 2013, described as a \"creative and innovative campaign\" and in its use of art, poetry, film and music to bring the issue of summary extradition to wider public and political attention described as \"inspiring\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gary McKinnon", "response": ["* Syed Talha Ahsan"]}, {"page": "Haroon Rashid Aswat", "response": ["In 2010 the European Court of Human Rights blocked the extradition orders of Aswat, Abu Hamza, Babar Ahmad and Syed Talha Ahsan."]}, {"page": "NatWest Three", "response": ["* Syed Talha Ahsan"]}, {"page": "UK\u2013US extradition treaty of 2003", "response": ["* Syed Talha Ahsan \u2013 extradited in 2012 on charges of running web sites supporting the Chechen and Afghan insurgencies while in the UK, co-defendant with Babar Ahmad"]}, {"page": "Babar Ahmad", "response": ["Babar Ahmad was re-arrested in London on 5 August 2004 on charges of providing material support to terrorism. An affidavit filed with the US court detailed that Ahmad established Azzam.com, a website established in 1996 that later solicited support for Chechen insurgents and the Taliban regime in 2000/01. It further stated that items recovered from a house used by Ahmad included a floppy disk containing a detailed description of the movements of the US Fifth Fleet battlegroup. Ahmad was later indicted by a grand jury of US citizens in October 2004. Another man, Syed Talha Ahsan, was indicted in 2006 of involvement with Ahmad and with the battlegroup information in the document. In 2008, a US former navy seaman, Abu Jihad, was indicted and convicted of disclosing the classified information on the battlegroup but he was cleared of terrorism charges. However, when sentencing Ahmad on 16 July 2014, federal district Judge Janet Hall ruled that \"nothing was done with the information\" found in Ahmad's possession so, \"the battle group document, besides showing that the Navy enlisted man was a traitor to his country, it also shows that Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Ahsan had absolutely no interest in operational terrorist actions that would harm the United States.\""]}, {"page": "List of British Bangladeshis", "response": ["* Syed Talha Ahsan \u2013 Poet and translator who won the 2012 Platinum and Bronze Koestler Award for his poetry.
