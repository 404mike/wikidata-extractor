He moved on to Preston North End in December 1967. In seven years with Preston he made 245 league appearances, and also served as their captain as they won the Third Division title in 1970\u201371. He signed with Blackburn Rovers in 1974, playing over 100 games in a four-year spell, helping the club to the Third Division title in 1974\u201375. He was sold to Port Vale in January 1978, where he first entered into coaching, before his departure in late 1979. He made a total of 502 league and cup appearances in the English Football League.\nServing as Shrewsbury Town's assistant manager, he was given the top job at Wolves in 1982. He led the club to promotion out of the Second Division in 1982\u201383, before he lost his position in April 1984.

Plunging match attendances in the early-1980s, at least partly due to recession in both the national and local economies, and consequent difficulties in repaying the loans taken out to fund the new John Ireland Stand, led the club to receivership and relegation in 1982. The club was saved from liquidation at the last minute when it was purchased by a consortium fronted by former player Derek Dougan. Initially this takeover, financed by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti of the company Allied Properties, brought immediate promotion back to the First Division under manager Graham Hawkins, but the Bhattis' failure to invest sufficiently in the club soon saw things unravel as the team suffered three consecutive relegations through the football divisions under different managers, as well as the almost-constant threat of the club being wound-up."]}, {"page": "Darlaston", "response": ["*Graham Hawkins (1946-2016), ex footballer and manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers was born in Darlaston"]}, {"page": "Los Angeles Wolves", "response": ["*  Graham Hawkins (D) (1967)"]}, {"page": "Derek Dougan", "response": ["In August 1982, he fronted a consortium \u2013 funded by Saudi brothers Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti of the company Allied Properties \u2013 that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, beating a rival bid from Doug Ellis. The brothers wanted anonymity, and were only revealed to the public after investigation by journalists. He sacked manager Ian Greaves and replaced him with former Wolves teammate Graham Hawkins. However the council rejected planning permission for the club to construct a supermarket, and the Bhattis were unwilling or unable to provide further funding for the club. Wolves won promotion out of the Second Division in 1982\u201383, but were relegated out of the First Division in last place in 1983\u201384, and Dougan sacked Hawkins and replaced him with Tommy Docherty.

He replaced club legend Roy Sproson, and was given a large war chest to spend after a successful lottery scheme was set up at Vale Park. He took over with the club in 21st place in the Third Division. His first game in charge was a 0\u20130 draw with Midland Counties League side Arnold in the First Round of the FA Cup. In January, veteran defender Graham Hawkins was signed as a player-coach from Blackburn Rovers for \u00a36,000. Forward Neville Chamberlain also joined the club as a professional, becoming the club's first black pro. John Froggatt also joined the club, signing from Colchester United for \u00a310,000. Chairman Arthur McPherson celebrated this abandonment of frugality by declaring \"we are going places\". Local journalist Chris Harper slated the board for their decisions, calling them 'berserk'. Froggatt scored fifteen seconds into his debut in a 4\u20130 win over Exeter City. However this would be as good as it got for both Froggatt and Vale that season. In February, Vale beat Fort Lauderdale Strikers in a friendly, but also started a five games sequence without a win. Ged Stenson arrived the next month from Everton for a 'bargain' \u00a33,000, and John Lumsdon joined on loan from Stoke City. Vale improved, and were unbeaten in six of their seven March games, with Chamberlain scoring on his debut. Yet on 28 March they started a club-record streak of twelve home games without a win that would continue into the following season. Encouragement came from the youth side, who reached the Quarter Finals of the FA Youth Cup. With four games to go, Vale were one point clear of the drop, however by losing all of their remaining games the \"Valiants\" ended the 1977\u201378 season in 21st place and were relegated into the Fourth Division. Smith was appointed as manager of Swindon Town in May 1978, with the club having to pay a compensation fee of \u00a310,500 to Port Vale. His assistant, Dennis Butler, stayed on at the club and was appointed as his successor."]}, {"page": "Black Country derby", "response": ["| 1982\u201384 || 1 ||align=\"left\"|  Ron Wylie || 0 || 0 || 1 ||rowspan=\"2\" align=\"left\"|  Graham Hawkins"]}, {"page": "Peter Knowles", "response": ["Knowles was now retired from football, and the dream of winning a full England cap would never be fulfilled. But a succession of Wolves managers held out the hope that Knowles might one day return to the game, and he remained on contract at the club for the next 12 years. In 1982, however, new manager Graham Hawkins conceded that Knowles would never return, and promptly terminated the 36-year-old's contract. 1991 saw folk musician Billy Bragg release a song which many saw as a direct reference to Knowles. The song was called \"God's Footballer\", from Bragg's album Don't Try This at Home."]}]}}
