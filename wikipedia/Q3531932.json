As well as Matt Marriott, he also worked at Mickey Mouse Weekly, where he worked on \"Billy Brave\", \"Pride of the Circus\", \"Savage Splendour\", and \"Robin Alone\". He illustrated \"The Colditz Story\" for Junior Express and was voted Serious Strip Cartoonist of the Year, 1961. In the 1980s he drew \"Rookwood\" for Look and Learn magazine and a few sequences in Alan Moore and David Lloyd's V for Vendetta, at the invitation of Lloyd, an admirer of his work.\nDavid Lloyd wrote about him:\n\nTony was one of just a very few strip artists here and in the US whose creative identities owed nothing to the heritage of stylisation which influenced many other newspaper adventure strip creators\u2014he was primarily an illustrator who just happened to love drawing strips. . . . He also had a superb command of light and shade, which promoted the impression that he was drawing something he could see in front of him, rather than something he'd built up from his imagination.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "V for Vendetta", "response": ["V for Vendetta is a British graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd (with additional art by Tony Weare). Initially published, starting in 1982, in black-and-white as an ongoing serial in the short-lived UK anthology Warrior, it morphed into a ten-issue limited series published by DC Comics. Subsequent collected editions were typically published under DC's more specialized imprint, Vertigo, until that label was shut down in 2018. Since then it has been transferred to Black Label. The story depicts a dystopian and post-apocalyptic near-future history version of the United Kingdom in the 1990s, preceded by a nuclear war in the 1980s that devastated most of the rest of the world. The Nordic supremacist, neo-fascist, outwardly Christofascistic, and homophobic fictional Norsefire political party has exterminated its opponents in concentration camps, and now rules the country as a police state.", "When the publishers cancelled Warrior in 1985 (with two completed issues unpublished due to the cancellation), several companies attempted to convince Moore and Lloyd to let them publish and complete the story. In 1988, DC Comics published a ten-issue series that reprinted the Warrior stories in colour, then continued the series to completion. The first new material appeared in issue No. 7, which included the unpublished episodes that would have appeared in Warrior No. 27 and No. 28. Tony Weare drew one chapter (\"Vincent\") and contributed additional art to two others (\"Valerie\" and \"The Vacation\"); Steve Whitaker and Siobhan Dodds worked as colourists on the entire series."]}, {"page": "Wincanton", "response": ["The cartoonist Tony Weare was born in Wincanton."]}, {"page": "Arts University Bournemouth", "response": ["* Tony Weare, comics artist best known for the Matt Marriott western strip in The Evening News and Illustration for V for Vendetta (Bournemouth School of Art)"]}, {"page": "David Lloyd (comics)", "response": ["David Lloyd started working in comics in the late 1970s, drawing for Halls of Horror, TV Comic and a number of Marvel UK titles.
