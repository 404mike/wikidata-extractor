As well as Matt Marriott, he also worked at Mickey Mouse Weekly, where he worked on \"Billy Brave\", \"Pride of the Circus\", \"Savage Splendour\", and \"Robin Alone\". He illustrated \"The Colditz Story\" for Junior Express and was voted Serious Strip Cartoonist of the Year, 1961. In the 1980s he drew \"Rookwood\" for Look and Learn magazine and a few sequences in Alan Moore and David Lloyd's V for Vendetta, at the invitation of Lloyd, an admirer of his work.\nDavid Lloyd wrote about him:\n\nTony was one of just a very few strip artists here and in the US whose creative identities owed nothing to the heritage of stylisation which influenced many other newspaper adventure strip creators\u2014he was primarily an illustrator who just happened to love drawing strips. . . . He also had a superb command of light and shade, which promoted the impression that he was drawing something he could see in front of him, rather than something he'd built up from his imagination.", "link_mentions": {}}}
