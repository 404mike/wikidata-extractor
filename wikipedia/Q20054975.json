H. Emmerson, was an English painter and illustrator.\nEmmerson (n\u00e9e  Hetherington). At the age of 13, he went to Newcastle, where he studied painting and engraving under William Bell Scott at the Government School of Art. After some two and a half years under Scott's tutelage, Emmerson was sent to Paris to study for six months as the beneficiary of a clergyman who had taken interest in his work. After his return, he was accepted into the Royal Academy in London.Upon his return to northern England, he lived in Ebchester and met his soon-to-be wife. Emmerson was a founding member and first president of the Bewick Club, a Newcastle association of painters and illustrators that also included among its founders the likes of Robert Jobling, Ralph Hedley, John Surtees, and Thomas Dickinson. Notable paintings of Emmerson, some of which hung in the Royal Academy, include The Queen's Letter, The Critics, The First Suit, and The Foreign Invasion. His paintings of children were numerous and well known, with several being reproduced and popularised as engravings. A total of 58 works by Emmerson were exhibited at the Royal Academy during his lifetime.\n\nEmmerson also provided illustrations to children's books, including Afternoon Tea (1880) with J. G. Sowerby, and The May Blossom (1881), both published by Frederick Warne & Co. Afternoon Tea, although well received by reviewers attracted a bit of controversy, as some claimed it was a cheap derivative of Under the Window, a popular 1879 book by Kate Greenaway. Greenaway herself considered the book \"blatant piracy\", while Sowerby argued the illustrations were not imitations but merely in the same genre.Emmerson was also well known as a runner in his time. As a child, he was said to be the fastest of his age in the world; a challenge was placed in Bell's Life in London to run against any boy his age, and was never accepted. Emmerson was an ardent runner even to the end of his life, as well as an avid follower of the Rockcliff Football team.Emmerson married Mary Bolton of Ebchester on 15 August 1857, and they had five daughters and two sons, both of whom were also artists. He died in his home in Cullercoats on 28 August 1895 at the age of 64, and was buried in Preston Cemetery in North Shields. In December 1895, an exhibition of his collected work was held in Newcastle. Emmerson claimed to be of the family that produced the poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, although biographical details published after his death suggest the relation was probably very remote.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cragside", "response": ["A portrait of Armstrong by Henry Hetherington Emmerson shows him sitting in the inglenook with his dogs, under a carved inscription on the mantlepiece reading East or West, Hame's Best.

He had the first of many paintings, The Newsboy, accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1879.  Joining with Henry Hetherington Emmerson and Robert Jobling, they founded the Bewick Club which encouraged and exhibited the work of the local artists of the North East, staging the first exhibition in 1884.Artist Biographies- Bewick Club www.artbiogs.co.uk, accessed 16 December 2019"]}, {"page": "John Chambers (artist)", "response": ["Chambers maintained a succession of studios at North Shields where, at times, he directed painting classes,Shields Daily News, 2 January 1909 and at which he held exhibitions of his work, and occasionally those of fellow artists. It was also shown before being sold in large quantities by Bainbridge & Co., a North Shields auctioneers,Shields Daily News, 21 October 1911 & 6 February 1915 and featured in several local loan exhibitions. Despite frequent favourable comments on his work, he remained a quiet, diffident artist who died at his home and studio at Borough Road, North Shields, without really extending his reputation beyond his native Northumbria, although he is reputed to have lectured on art in other parts of the country,North Mail and Newcastle Chronicle, 12 July 1928 was a regular visitor to the Berwickshire coastline,Shields Daily News, 21 October 1892 & 8 November 1899 and had also worked in Holland. Although much of this reputation rested on his nautical and landscape paintings he also etched subjects for sale locally and was an occasional illustrator of Tyneside publications. Among his less typical works were a number of portraits in watercolour, among these one of Henry Hetherington Emmerson now in the possession of the Laing Art Gallery. He also produced a sketch of Emmerson for the menu card of the annual Bewick Club dinner in 1889."]}]}}
