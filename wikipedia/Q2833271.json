During the civil war, their parents join the police reserve. Bobo and her sister are warned not to come into their parents' bedroom in the night because they sleep with loaded guns. Then at Independence (1980), Bobo and her classmates are stunned to see black pupils far wealthier and more sophisticated than them joining their elite high school. Their farm is seized by the new government and awarded to political cronies under a land distribution programme and they move south to a much harsher ranch, where their diet is based on impala and brackish water from a borehole that is strictly rationed."]}, {"page": "Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexandra Fuller"]}, {"page": "Bianca Amato", "response": ["| Alexandra Fuller"]}, {"page": "Arundel School", "response": ["* Alexandra Fuller - Novelist"]}, {"page": "List of Zimbabwean women writers", "response": ["* Alexandra Fuller (born 1969)"]}, {"page": "Alexandra Fuller (squash player)", "response": ["Alexandra Fuller (born 24 August 1993 in Cape Town) is a South African professional squash player.
