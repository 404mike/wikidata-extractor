It was advertised in the spring of 1913 and was taken by  Gilbert Cannan and his new wife Mary (n\u00e9e Ansell), who had previously been married to J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan.  The Cannans immediately set about decorating the mill house property in an avantgarde style and the mill tower into an impromptu studio. Land was acquired at the rear of the property to create a garden.  They invited their many friends and acquaintances, many of whom were associated with two artists' groups, the Bloomsbury Group and the lesser well-known London Group which were both prominent around the time of the First World War. The couple frequently invited so many of their friends to stay that it necessitated renting out neighbouring cottages. D. H. Lawrence and his new wife Freda rented a cottage in nearby Bellingdon and Katherine Mansfield and John Middleton Murry who were having an affair at the time lodged, next door to the Cannans, at The Gables before renting a cottage three miles away at The Lee. In December 1914 the group were joined by Ukrainian writer S. S. Koteliansky and the painter Mark Gertler and all spent a raucous Christmas partying in each other's houses. These, and related events at Cholesbury were depicted in pictures or formed the basis of several subsequent accounts in letters, memoirs and novels."]}, {"page": "Samuel Solomonovich Koteliansky", "response": ["#REDIRECT S.
