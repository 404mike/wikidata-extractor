On 19 May, Ottoman troops had attempted to break the deadlock with a counter-attack on Anzac Cove, but had suffered heavy casualties. In August, an Allied offensive (which later became known as the Battle of Sari Bair) was intended to break the deadlock by capturing the high ground of the Sari Bair range, and linking the Anzac front with a new landing to the north at Suvla. Along with the main advance north out of the Anzac perimeter, supporting attacks were planned from the existing trench positions. Higher-level conceptual planning for the offensive was undertaken by the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, and Colonel Andrew Skeen; more detailed tactical planning devolved to other staff. Tactical command of the offensive to secure Sari Bair was given to Godley, who was at the time in command of the New Zealand and Australian Division."]}, {"page": "Skeen", "response": ["*Sir Andrew Skeen (1873\u20131935), British Indian Army general", "*Andrew Skeen (Rhodesia) (c.1906\u20131984), British Indian Army officer\t and Rhodesian politician"]}, {"page": "Harold Walker (British Army officer)", "response": ["For the invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula, it was Walker's role to formulate the landing plans for ANZAC but he deferred management of the planning to his subordinate, Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Skeen, who was an excellent staff officer.  Walker was keen to hold a fighting command and his opportunity arose during the landing at Anzac Cove, 25 April 1915, when the commander of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, Colonel Francis Johnston, became ill. Walker had landed as Birdwood's representative on the beach and was instructed to assume command of the brigade which held the left flank of the Anzac perimeter, occupying a ridge that was given the name \"Walker's Ridge\".  Walker relinquished command of the brigade when Johnston returned to duty but was soon after, on 30 April, given permanent command of the Australian 1st Infantry Brigade whose commander, Colonel H.

The creation of a military academy equivalent to Sandhurst was also examined. The Skeen Committee reported in April 1927, and one of its recommendations was that Indian cadets be accepted for officer training at RAF Cranwell. The bravery of the RFC\u2019s South Asian pilots was referenced in support of this, and veteran Hardit Singh Malik\u2019s impressive appearance before the committee lent added weight. Discussions between the British and Indian governments continued until Lord Birkenhead, Secretary of State for India, approved the creation of an Indian Air Force on 5 April 1928.

As the 43rd and 67th Brigades were grouped together as the Derajet Column and committed to the fighting, they met heavy resistance as the largely inexperienced Indian units came up against determined, well-armed tribesmen. Due to the denuding of the Indian Army caused by commitments overseas during the First World War, many of the battalions employed in this campaign were second-line units with disproportionately large numbers of very young soldiers with inexperienced officers."]}, {"page": "Southern Command (India)", "response": ["*1923 \u2013 Mar 1924 Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Skeen "]}, {"page": "Chief of the General Staff (India)", "response": ["|General Sir Andrew Skeen"]}, {"page": "List of British Army full generals", "response": ["| Sir Andrew Skeen"]}, {"page": "1925 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Sir Andrew Skeen, , Indian Army, Chief of the General Staff, India."]}, {"page": "1922 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Major-General Sir Andrew Skeen  Indian Army, General Officer Commanding, Kohat District, Northern Command, India"]}, {"page": "Skeen, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Skeen"]}, {"page": "Skipton Climo", "response": ["He married Ethel Bessie Mann (1893\u22121974), 25 years his junior, on 15 April 1925; they had no children.Biography, Who's Who The couple also owned the Villa La Madeleine in Cannes,\"The Riviera\", The Times, 12 November 1927 where they spent the winter and were members of the exclusive Cercle Nautique club.\"The Riviera\", The Times, 3 December 1928 Climo was also president of the Cannes branch of the Royal British Legion in 1931.\"The Riviera\", The Times, 3 March 1931 During his army days, Climo had been one of the best polo players in the Indian Army.\"Naval, Military and Air Force\", The Times, 9 December 1929 He was also a keen golfer and fisherman and a close friend of General Sir Andrew Skeen since his early days in India.
