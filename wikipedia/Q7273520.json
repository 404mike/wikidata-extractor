One of its authors is Mr Watson, whom his collaborator, Mr La Serre, must often have asked, \"Do you follow me, Watson?\" Miss Lee's caricature of the style and make-up of the Lyceum heroine is very good, and the same may be said of Mr Clarence Blakiston who cleverly reproduces some of the mannerisms of Mr Gillette as the great detective, but who fails in the make-up, which is just \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s. Nothing could be better than the caricature of Forman by Mr Egerton Hubbard; and Mr J. Willes, representing the Lyceum Professor Moriarty, plays the part with such real burlesque humour as to atone for the dissimilarity in appearance between him and Mr Abingdon. The slamming of the doors, the banging on the floor, the rattling noises \"heard without\", the perpetual pistols of the original, are turned to good account, while very little is made out of the incident of \"following the cigar.\" Indeed, several evident points have been lost by these burlesque-writers. With the aid of so clever a musical director as Mr Buccalossi the authors ought to have introduced some real good \"numbers\" and eccentric dances, without which, coming in as surprises, it is very difficult for any burlesque to achieve genuine success. What a hit might have been made by Sherlock Holmes revealing his knowledge of the principal villain's real character in a song commencing \"I'll sing thee songs of Larabee!\" The burlesque is good as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough.Arthur Conan Doyle, R.
