Middlesbrough boost their bid for a UEFA Cup place by spending a total of \u00a38.5million on new signings Chris Riggott, Malcolm Christie and Michael Ricketts. The true extent of Leeds United's financial difficulties becomes public knowledge during a press conference to announce the sale of Jonathan Woodgate to Newcastle United for \u00a39million, during which Terry Venables states that he had been assured players wouldn't need to be sold.

On 5 May 2001, he scored the winning goal at Old Trafford as Derby beat Manchester United 1\u20130 to secure survival for the club. He spent one more season with Derby after they were relegated from the FA Premier League before Middlesbrough signed him and Chris Riggott for a combined \u00a33 million (possibly rising to \u00a35m) in February 2003. Christie was part of Middlesbrough's 2004 League Cup-winning team. Despite being injured for the final, he appeared in the earlier rounds and scored the winner against Brighton & Hove Albion. His chances were limited at his new club due to several long-term injuries. In 2006, although unable to play due to injury, Christie was invited back to Nuneaton Borough as guest of honour for their FA Cup third round tie against Middlesbrough.

After 20 minutes, Sevilla attacked down their right wing; Alves had the opportunity to shoot, but passed the ball across to Javier Saviola, whose shot was blocked by Gareth Southgate. Six minutes later, Sevilla attacked through Alves again. He crossed the ball to Lu\u00eds Fabiano who headed the ball in off the post to give Sevilla a 1\u20130 lead. Three minutes later, Sevilla had another chance at goal, but Adriano shot went over the crossbar.
