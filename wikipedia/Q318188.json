This revival was due to the fictionalized depiction of Salieri in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus (1979) and its 1984 film version. The death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1791 at the age of 35 was followed by rumors that he and Salieri had been bitter rivals, and that Salieri had poisoned the younger composer, yet this has been proven false,For discussion, with references, of the poisoning rumor see . The Norton/Grove Concise Encyclopedia of Music states flatly, \"He was not poisoned\"; see  and it is likely that they were, at least, mutually respectful peers.", "Salieri and his music were largely forgotten from the 19th century until the late 20th century. This revival was due to the dramatic and highly fictionalized depiction of Salieri in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus (1979), which was given its greatest exposure in its 1984 film version, directed by Milo\u0161 Forman. His music today has regained some modest popularity via recordings. It is also the subject of increasing academic study, and a small number of his operas have returned to the stage. In addition, there is now a Salieri Opera Festival sponsored by the Fondazione Culturale Antonio Salieri and dedicated to rediscovering his work and those of his contemporaries. It is developing as an annual autumn event in his native town of Legnago, where a theatre has been renamed in his honour.", "*A hugely popular yet heavily fictionalized perpetuation of the story came in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus (1979) and its Oscar-winning 1984 film adaptation directed by Milo\u0161 Forman.

Murray Abraham (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the part).

She soon became a fixture at the Royal National Theatre in the 1960s. British theatre critic Michael Coveney wrote that during her eight years in the company, Smith developed a fierce rivalry with Olivier writing, \"He knew immediately he\u2019d met his match \u2013 that she was extraordinary. He said that anyone who can play comedy that well can also play tragedy and he offered her the likes of Desdemona in Shakespeare\u2019s Othello.

Bernard Schweizer's book Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism is devoted to this topic.

The main literary figures in his study are Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Swinburne, Zora Neale Hurston, Rebecca West, Elie Wiesel, Peter Shaffer, and Philip Pullman. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium for the expression of God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism, while ingeneously veiling their blasphemy.Bernard Schweizer, Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism (2010).", "Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus (1979) has the character Salieri rebel against a God he feels neglected and humiliated by."]}, {"page": "Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor", "response": ["Joseph is prominently featured in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus and the movie based upon it.

Advance sales topped \u00a31.7\u00a0million, and the role generated significant pre-opening media interest, as Radcliffe appeared in a nude scene. Equus opened on 27 February 2007 and ran until 9 June 2007. Radcliffe's performance was acclaimed, as critics were impressed by the nuance and depth of his against-type role. Charles Spencer of The Telegraph wrote that the actor \"displays a dramatic power and an electrifying stage presence that marks a tremendous leap forward.\" He added: \"I never thought I would find the diminutive (but perfectly formed) Radcliffe a sinister figure, but as Alan Strang ... there are moments when he seems genuinely scary in his rage and confusion.\" The production transferred to Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre in September 2008. Radcliffe continued in the lead role, starring alongside Kate Mulgrew, Anna Camp, and his Harry Potter co-star Richard Griffiths. Radcliffe felt nervous about reprising the role on Broadway as he considered American audiences to be more discerning than those in London.
