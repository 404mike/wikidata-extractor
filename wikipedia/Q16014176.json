Ashley Dukes, Marie Rambert's husband suggested there might be a ballet around the picture, also introducing can-can dancers. In fact the role was created by Pearl Argyle, but Schooling danced it subsequently.Rambert, Marie. Quicksilver: an autobiography. Papermac (Macmillan Publishers Ltd), London, 1983, p157.

It became the role with which she was most closely associated. Howard was unable to dance the part herself due to illness, and Marie Rambert suggested Gilmour. Helped by extensive coaching and Nadia Benois' costume designs, she successfully conveyed the transformation from Mrs Tebrick into a wild vixen."]}, {"page": "Frank Staff", "response": ["Staff's first choreographic work, The Tartans, was a new version of Ashton's ballet of the same name. A pas de trois for himself, his wife Elisabeth Schooling, and Walter Gore, set to music by William Boyce, it was made for Ballet Rambert in 1938. Over the next two years, he contributed three of his best works to the company's repertory: Czernyana (1939), to the piano exercises of Carl Czerny; Enigma Variations (1939), to the score by Edward Elgar; and Peter and the Wolf (1940), to the music and text of Sergei Prokofiev.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \"Staff, Frank,\" in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). All these works displayed his facility for witty invention that would characterize many of his later ballets. He also created Czerny 2 (1941), a second version of his popular hit, a series of dances caricaturing different kinds of ballet. Combined with its predecessor under the title Czernyana, it remained in the Rambert repertory for many years.Marie Rambert, Quicksilver: An Autobiography (London: Macmillan, 1972). During the war years in England\u2014September 1939 to May 1945\u2014Staff served as a captain in the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders but was released temporarily to choreograph Peter and the Wolf and Czerny 2.Grut, \"Staff, Frank Cedric\" (1981), p. 414.", "Staff married four times.Craine and Mackrel, \"Staff, Frank\" (2000). He wed his fellow Ballet Rambert dancer Elisabeth Schooling in 1942, and she danced in many of his early works.Nadine Meisner, \"Obituary: Elisabeth Schooling,\" The Independent (London), 30 June 1998). He next married English dancer Jaqueline St. Clere, followed by South African musical comedy actress Heather Lloyd-Jones. All three of these marriages ended in divorce. Staff's fourth wife was South African dancer Veronica Paeper, who became a prolific choreographer in her own right as director of CAPAB Ballet, later known as Cape Town City Ballet.Veronica Paeper website, http://www.paeperballet.com.
