Hatfield's batting style is unknown.  He was born at Southwell, Nottinghamshire.\nHatfield made a single first-class appearance for Nottinghamshire against Surrey in 1854 at Broadwater Park, Godalming.  Surrey won the toss and elected to bat first, making 113 all out in their first-innings.  Nottinghamshire responded in their first-innings by making 100 all out, with Hatfield, who opened the batting, scoring 3 runs before he was dismissed by Heathfield Stephenson.  Surrey then made 107 all out in their second-innings, leaving Nottinghamshire with a target of 121 for victory.  However, Nottinghamshire could only manage to make just 55 all out in their second-innings, during which Hatfield, who had moved down the order to number seven, scored a single run before he was dismissed by Tom Shermam.  This was his only major appearance for Nottinghamshire.\nHe died at Rugby, Warwickshire, on 5 July 1889.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southwell, Nottinghamshire", "response": ["*John Hatfield (1831\u20131889), first-class cricketer, was born here."]}, {"page": "John Hatfield", "response": ["John Hatfield may refer to", "*John Hatfield (forger) (1758?\u20131803), British forger", "*John Hatfield (US Navy) (1795\u20131813), American midshipman", "*John Hatfield (cricketer) (1831\u20131889), English cricketer", "*John Hatfield (baseball) (1847\u20131909), American baseball player"]}]}}
