Stylistically, Britpop bands use catchy hooks and lyrics that were relevant to young British people of their own generation. Britpop bands conversely denounced grunge as irrelevant and having nothing to say about their lives. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by \"youthful exuberance and desire for recognition\". Damon Albarn of Blur summed up the attitude in 1993 when after being asked if Blur were an \"anti-grunge band\" he said, \"Well, that's good. If punk was about getting rid of hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge.\" In spite of the professed disdain for the genres, some elements of both crept into the more enduring facets of Britpop. Noel Gallagher has since championed Ride and once stated that Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was the only songwriter he had respect for in the last ten years, and that he felt their music was similar enough that Cobain could have written \"Wonderwall\". By 1996, Oasis's prominence was such that NME termed a number of Britpop bands (including the Boo Radleys, Ocean Colour Scene and Cast) \"Noelrock\", citing Gallagher's influence on their music.Kessler, Ted. \"Noelrock!\" NME. 8 June 1996.

The dominant musical force of the period was the grunge invasion from the United States, which filled the void left in the indie scene by the Stone Roses' inactivity.Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop. Passion Pictures. 2004. Blur, however, took on an Anglocentric aesthetic with their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993). Their new approach was inspired by a tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. During the tour, frontman Damon Albarn began to resent American culture and found the need to comment on that culture's influence seeping into Britain. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Albarn) explained, \"Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness.\"Harris, pg. 79. John Harris wrote in an NME article just before the release of Modern Life is Rubbish: \"[Blur's] timing has been fortuitously perfect. Why? Because, as with baggies and shoegazers, loud, long-haired Americans have just found themselves condemned to the ignominious corner labelled 'yesterday's thing'.\" The music press also fixated on what the NME had dubbed the New Wave of New Wave, a term applied to the more punk-derivative acts such as Elastica, S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men.", "Retrospective documentaries on the movement include The Britpop Story \u2013 a BBC programme presented by John Harris on BBC Four in August 2005 as part of Britpop Night, ten years after Blur and Oasis went head-to-head in the charts, and Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, a 2003 documentary film written and directed by John Dower.

Footman said the \"Radiohead Lite\" bands that followed were \"missing [OK Computer] sonic inventiveness, not to mention the lyrical substance.\" David Cavanagh said that most of OK Computers purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from the ballads on The Bends. According to Cavanagh, \"The populist albums of the post-OK Computer era\u2014the Verve's Urban Hymns, Travis's Good Feeling, Stereophonics' Word Gets Around, Robbie Williams' Life thru a Lens\u2014effectively closed the door that OK Computers boffin-esque inventiveness had opened.\" John Harris believed that OK Computer was one of the \"fleeting signs that British rock music might [have been] returning to its inventive traditions\" in the wake of Britpop's demise.

From hereon in, the lighter-than-air ballad became obligatory, and the leather-trousers era of rock'n'roll was over.\" The success of the album in Britain resulted in Oasis becoming a cultural ubiquity for a brief period, featuring in tabloid newspapers on an almost daily basis and breaking sales records for live concerts."]}, {"page": "New wave of new wave", "response": ["The new wave of new wave (NWONW) was a term coined by music journalists to describe a subgenre of the British alternative rock scene in the early 1990s, in which bands displayed post-punk and new wave influences, particularly from bands such as The Clash, Blondie, Wire, and The Stranglers.Childs, Peter & Storry, Mike (1999) Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture, Routledge, , p. 365. The associated bands generally played guitar-based rock music often accompanied by keyboards. The movement was short-lived, and several of the bands involved were later linked with the more commercially successful Britpop, which it immediately preceded, and the NWONW was described by John Harris of The Guardian (one of the journalists who first coined the term) as \"Britpop without the good bits\".Harris, John (2006) \"The new wave of old rubbish\", The Guardian, 13 October 2006. The NME played a major part in promoting and covering the genre, and promoted the On event, which featured many of the bands they had labelled NWONW.Larkin, Colin (2006) The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Oxford University Press."]}, {"page": "Be Here Now (album)", "response": ["Contemporaneous reviews of Be Here Now were, in John Harris's words, unanimous with \"truly amazing praise\". According to Harris, \"To find an album that had attracted gushing notices in such profusion, one had to go back thirty years, to the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\"Harris (2004), p. 339. While Q described the album as \"cocaine set to music\", most early reviews praised the record's length, volume and ambition, including Charles Shaar Murray, who called it the \"Oasis World Domination Album\" in MOJO. David Fricke of Rolling Stone complimented the song formula throughout the album, writing that it \"pays off\". However, as a whole, he felt the album was \"music built for impact, not explanation\". Dele Fadele of Vox describes it as \"a veritable rock'n'roll monsoon of an album; a giant jigsaw puzzle, an elemental force, a monster that cannot and will not be contained.\""]}, {"page": "Andy Partridge", "response": ["While XTC were a formative punk group, Partridge's music drew heavily from British Invasion songwriters, and his style gradually shifted to more traditional pop, often with pastoral themes. Music critic John Harris said that Partridge exemplified \"a very English genre: rock music uprooted from the glamour and dazzle of the city, and recast as the soundtrack to life in suburbs, small towns, and the kind of places \u2013 like Swindon \u2013 that may be more sizeable, but are still held up as bywords for broken hopes and limited horizons.\" He cited Partridge's 1981 song \"Respectable Street\" as one of the \"most evocative items\" in his catalog. Partridge stated that his favourite XTC album was Nonsuch (1992) and considered \"Rook\" (1992), \"Wrapped in Grey\" (1992) and \"Easter Theatre\" (1999) to be the \"perfect songs\" of his career. For many years, he also regarded \"Seagulls Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her\" (1984) as his finest song."]}, {"page": "Emmanuel Schools Foundation", "response": ["In 2005, John Harris in The Guardian accused Emmanuel Schools Foundation of promoting fundamentalist Christianity.What a creation...

Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian, named the album the \"Pop CD of the Week\" and stated that it \"fills a gap created by the current profusion of serious rock bands like Radiohead; elbowing its way up front, [and letting] rip with adolescent vigour.\" She went on to summarize the record as \"the perfect party soundtrack by the perfect party band.\" Selects John Harris praised the Beastie Boys' lyrics as being as \"fantastically off-beam as ever\" while at the same time noting that they had \"broadened their musical vistas yet further\". Although AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that the album's ending was \"a little anticlimactic\", he also saw Hello Nasty as a progressive step forward from the group's 1992 LP Check Your Head, and praised the input of the group's new recruit, Mixmaster Mike; \"Hiring DJ Mixmaster Mike turned out to be a masterstroke; he and the Beasties created a sound that strongly recalls the spare electronic funk of the early '80s, but spiked with the samples and post-modern absurdist wit that have become their trademarks.\" In his review for Entertainment Weekly, David Browne highlighted the album's multi-genre sound, along with the group's use of a wide range of musical styles, as its most engaging aspect;"]}, {"page": "Nick Clegg", "response": ["Ahead of the release of the whistleblown Facebook Files in October 2021, Clegg authored an internal memo saying that there was no evidence Facebook was a main cause in polarisation and that the company does not \"profit from polarization, in fact, just the opposite.\" He later posted a public statement saying that the reporting on the Files \"conferred egregiously false motives to Facebook's leadership and employees,\" saying that it was \"just plain false\" that Facebook ignored its own internal research. After the release of the Files, he then made a number of public interviews defending the company. In one of the interviews, he stated that \"I can't give you a yes or no answer\" when asked if Facebook played a role in amplifying extremist content ahead of the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Clegg faced criticism for his role in defending the company, with The Guardian journalist John Harris dubbing him \"the fall guy for Facebook's failures.\""]}, {"page": "Band on the Run", "response": ["Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote in 1981: \"I originally underrated what many consider McCartney's definitive post-Beatles statement, but not as much as its admirers overrate it. Pop masterpiece? This? Sure it's a relief after the vagaries of Wild Life and Red Rose Speedway.\" He praised the title track and the \"Afro-soul\" introduction to \"Mamunia\", calling them \"the high points\". Christgau ultimately awarded the album a C+ rating, indicating \"a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork\". In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine feels that while some songs are excellent and the album overall is enjoyable, it is more showmanship than content. The Rolling Stone reviewer of the 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition said that \"the real action still lies in the original LP's revved-up pleasures\". Writing for Mojo magazine in 2011, John Harris included Band on the Run among \"the trilogy of truly essential post-Beatles solo albums\", along with Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Lennon's Plastic Ono Band."]}]}}
