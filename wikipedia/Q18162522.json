Inspired by the energy of punk rock but feeling the style to be too conservative, the group drew influence from the avant-garde, black music styles such as free jazz and dub, and radical political traditions. Guitarist Gareth Sager and drummer Bruce Smith were eventually added to the group. Soon after forming, they began to gain notoriety for their live performances and were signed to Radar Records. They appeared on the cover of the NME. The band donated the proceeds from their first high-profile tour to Amnesty International. They issued their debut single \"She Is Beyond Good and Evil\" in March 1979 and their debut album Y  in April of that year, both to acclaim but relatively low sales figures. Regardless, their moderate success was sufficient to convince Rough Trade to sign the band. During this period, Dan Catsis replaced Underwood on bass."]}, {"page": "Y (album)", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Alright, Still", "response": ["* John Waddington \u2013 bass "]}, {"page": "For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "John Waddington", "response": ["John Waddington may refer to:", "* John Waddington (minister) (1810\u20131880), English congregational cleric", "* John Waddington (governor) (1890\u20131957), English colonial administrator, Governor of Barbados and of Northern Rhodesia ", "* John Waddington (priest) (1910\u20131994), Anglican Provost of St Edmundsbury", "* John Waddington (South African cricketer) (1918\u20131985), South African cricketer, played for Griqualand West 1934\u201359", "* John Waddington (Essex cricketer) (1910\u20131995), English cricketer, played for Essex in 1931", "* John Waddington (footballer) (born 1938), Australian rules footballer", "* John Waddington (musician), British guitarist, formerly of The Pop Group", "* John Waddington Limited, card and board game company"]}, {"page": "She Is Beyond Good and Evil", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "We Are Time", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "We Are All Prostitutes (album)", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "We Are All Prostitutes (song)", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "In the Beginning There Was Rhythm / Where There's a Will There's a Way", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Cabinet of Curiosities (album)", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar, bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Idealists in Distress From Bristol", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar, bass guitar"]}, {"page": "The Boys Whose Head Exploded", "response": ["* John Waddington\u00a0\u2013 guitar, bass guitar"]}]}}
