In 1972\u201373, he had a season with Irvine Meadow, when the club reached the final of the Scottish Junior Cup versus Cambuslang Rangers and eventually won the trophy after two replays. Morris scored one goal in the final that ended 2\u20132, then two goals in the first replay that finished 3\u20133. Irvine Meadow won the second replay 1\u20130, with Morris' performances alerting the attention of Rangers, who signed him in the 1973 close season.\nMorris debuted for the Govan club in a Scottish League Cup match versus Arbroath in August 1973, then rarely featured in the first-team over his six-year spell at Ibrox. Morris' only goal for Rangers was in a Scottish Cup match versus Queen's Park in January 1974. Morris then moved onto Ayr United in 1979. After over 200 appearances at Somerset Park, Morris returned to Junior football with Cumnock Juniors.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eric Morris", "response": ["Eric Morris may refer to:", "* Eric Morris (actor) (born 1931), actor and acting teacher", "* Eric Morris (bassist)", "* Eric Morris (footballer, born 1951), Scottish football player with Rangers and Ayr United", "* Eric Morris (footballer, born 1940) (1940\u20132011), Welsh football player with Chester City", "* Eric Morris (1930s footballer), Welsh football defender", "* Eric Morris (American football) (born 1985), Texas Tech assistant coach and former player"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Eric Morris"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Eric Morris"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Eric Morris"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Eric Morris"]}]}}
