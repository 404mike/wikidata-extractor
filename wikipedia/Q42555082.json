Anderson", "response": ["Anderson's interest in sailing ships and their rigging led him to become one of the founder members of the Society for Nautical Research in 1910. In 1912, when the Society's journal, the Mariner's Mirror, ran into initial problems of finding material suitable to publish in a timely manner, Anderson was one of six men on the editorial committee who assumed the joint editorship from its first editor. Soon, this arrangement proved to be unworkable and Anderson became the sole editor by the acclamation of his colleagues in 1912. He remained editor until 1923, although publication was suspended during the war years. The Admiralty Librarian, W.G. Perrin succeeded Anderson as editor, turning the journal into a quarterly. With Perrin's sudden death in 1931\u201332, Anderson took over the editorship briefly until the new Admiralty Librarian David Bonner-Smith took up the editorial reins. On Bonner-Smith's resignation in 1939, Anderson became the editor for the third and final time, retaining the position through the Second World War until 1946.\"Editorial,\" Centenary Issue, Mariner's Mirror, vol. 97, no. 1 (2011), p.3.
