In the context of Latin American development, the term \"Latin American structuralism\" refers to the era of import substitution industrialization in many Latin American countries from the 1950s to the 1980s. The theories behind Latin American structuralism and ISI were organized in the works of economists such as Ra\u00fal Prebisch, Hans Singer, and Celso Furtado, and gained prominence with the creation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC or CEPAL).Renato, Aguilar (1986). \"Latin American structuralism and exogenous factors.\"Social Science Information, 25(1) p. 227-290.

What he did not have was a statistical argument. In February 1949, Hans Singer, then working in the United Nations Department of Economic Affairs in New York City, published a paper titled \"Post-war Price Relations between Under-developed and Industrialized Countries\", which suggested that the terms of trade of underdeveloped countries had declined significantly between 1876 and 1948. Inspired by this, Ra\u00fal Prebisch presented a paper of his own discussing the decline at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbeans second annual meeting, in Havana in May 1949."]}, {"page": "Dependency theory", "response": ["In Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916), Lenin proposed that wealth would extend to the advanced (industrial) capitalist countries from the underdeveloped countries. Later, dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949 \u2013 one by Hans Singer, one by Ra\u00fal Prebisch \u2013 in which the authors observe that the terms of trade for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer manufactured goods from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the Prebisch\u2013Singer thesis. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the United Nations Commission for Latin America (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of protectionism in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that import-substitution industrialisation (ISI), not a trade-and-export orientation, was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries.Short Prebisch biography  at Newschool; retrieved July 2009. The theory was developed from a Marxian perspective by Paul A. Baran in 1957 with the publication of his The Political Economy of Growth. Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of imperialism by Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin, and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, Celso Furtado, and An\u00edbal Pinto at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by Paul A. Baran, Paul Sweezy, and Andre Gunder Frank."]}, {"page": "Ra\u00fal Prebisch", "response": ["However, these ideas remained unformed until he was appointed executive director of the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA or CEPAL) in 1950.  In 1950, he released a study The Economic Development of Latin America and its Principal Problems   that stated what is now known as the Prebisch\u2013Singer hypothesis.  German economist Hans Singer had separately arrived at a similar conclusion as Prebisch at roughly the same time, although his paper used a more empirical approach based on analysis of world trade statistics.  The hypothesis begins with the observation that in the present world system the periphery produces primary goods to export to the center, and the centre produces secondary goods for export to the periphery. According to the hypothesis, as technology improves, the centre is able to retain the savings made, since it can retain higher wages and profits through developed unions and commercial institutions. At the periphery, companies and workers are weaker, and have to pass on technical savings to their customers in the form of lower prices. Prebisch pointed to the decline in the terms of trade between industrialised and non-industrialised countries, which meant peripheral nations had to export more to get the same value of industrial exports. Through this system, all of the benefits of technology and international trade would accrue to the centre."]}, {"page": "List of German Jews", "response": ["* Hans Singer, economist(The Economist, March 11th 2006, p. 95: \"born a Jew\")"]}, {"page": "International Institute of Social Studies", "response": ["* Hans Singer 1977"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2006", "response": ["*Sir Hans Singer, 95, German-born British economist, helped create the World Food Program and the United Nations Development Program."]}, {"page": "2006 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Hans Singer, economist, devised Prebisch\u2013Singer hypothesis (born 1910, German Empire)"]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish scientists", "response": ["* Sir Hans Singer, economistThe Economist, 11 March 2006 p95: \"born a Jew\""]}, {"page": "Arghiri Emmanuel", "response": ["The theory was an attempt to explain the falling trend in the terms of trade for underdeveloped countries, while criticising the different approaches of Ra\u00fal Prebisch, Hans Singer, and Arthur Lewis to do so as only half-hearted attempts.

Situations that countries are in at any one point in time reflect their previous investment decisions and development.

Unbalanced investment can complement or correct existing imbalances. Once such an investment is made, a new imbalance is likely to appear, requiring further compensating investments.
