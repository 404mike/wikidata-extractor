The daughter of a clergyman, Vanbrugh followed her elder sister Violet into the theatrical profession and sustained a career for more than 50 years.\nIn her early days as a leading lady she was particularly associated with the plays of Arthur Wing Pinero and later had parts written for her by J. M. Barrie, Bernard Shaw, Somerset Maugham, A. A. Milne and No\u00ebl Coward. More famous for comic rather than dramatic roles, Vanbrugh nevertheless played a number of the latter in both modern works and the classics. Her stage debut was in Shakespeare, but she seldom acted in his works later in her career; exceptions were her Queen Gertrude in Hamlet in 1931 and her Meg Page in The Merry Wives of Windsor, opposite her sister Violet as Alice Ford, in 1937.\nVanbrugh appeared frequently in fundraising shows for various charities. She was active over many years in the support of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, of which her brother was principal. After her death the Academy's new theatre was named The Vanbrugh Theatre in honour of her and her sister.", "link_mentions": {}}}
