A 2016 molecular phylogenetic study into the relationships of the Turkish species in the section Globiflorae aimed to reconcile this discrepancy, finding that the classification as proposed by Davis was largely correct: Globiflorae contained as distinct species D. cariensis, D. ferruginea, D. lamarckii, D. lanata and D. nervosa, and D. trojana was subsumed at the infraspecific rank as D. lanata subsp. trojana. This study listed 23 species: D. transiens, D. cedretorum, D. ikarica and D. fuscescens were not mentioned. D. parviflora and D. subalpina were not tested in this study, but the 2004 study found these two species situated within the section Globiflorae."]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1982: Peter Hadland Davis and Peter H.

He noticed that many species of plant that existed west of the diagonal were not present to the east, while others found to the east were not present to the west. Of 550 species analysed, 135 were \"eastern\" and 228 \"western\". However, Davis considered that there were no physical, geological or climatic differences or change in soil type that could account for the phenomenon. Not only does the Anatolian diagonal form a barrier to floral biodiversity, but about four hundred species of plant are endemic to this diagonal and are found nowhere else."]}, {"page": "Digitalis davisiana", "response": ["Digitalis davisiana was first scientifically discovered and collected in 1947 by the British botanist Peter Hadland Davis, who was very active in describing the flora of Turkey, Davis had actually first discovered the species growing on \u015eandras mountain in Mu\u011fla vilayet, Anatolia, in July,Staatliche Naturwissenschaftliche Sammlungen Bayerns.

Although the specimens were initially tentatively determined to be D. ambigua (now considered to be synonym of D. grandiflora), it was thence described as an entirely new species by another British botanist, Vernon Hilton Heywood, in 1949, designating a specimen from Davis' second collection, now housed in the Kew Herbarium, as the holotype.

In 1966 he was appointed senior botanist in the Botanical Division of the Forest Department of Lae, Papua Niugini, a role that allowed him to collect and study several plant species of the mainland of PNG and of New Ireland, writing a forest manual on Combretaceae and working on the Melanesian Terminalia. In 1972 he was the first taxonomist assigned to work on the Flore des Mascareignes project at Kew. In 1975 he was appointed chief scientific director of the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a position he held until 1998, also becoming director of the Kew Bulletin from 1977 to 1990.
