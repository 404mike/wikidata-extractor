As a result, the team routinely lacked cohesion and without Defoe for a large part lacked a quality striker in front of goal \u2013 though Connolly's immediate impact (five in the nine opening league games) and positive attitude coupled with Harewood's form went some way to make up for the loss of the future England international.", "This seven-game winning streak ended when they drew 0\u20130 with Bolton in the FA Cup Fifth Round, however their unbeaten run continued when they drew 2\u20132 against Everton in the Premier League before coming to an abrupt halt with a heavy defeat against Bolton, losing 4\u20131.
