He was also a talented amateur golfer.\nBorn in Newport, Monmouthshire, Phillips was educated at Monmouth Grammar School, leaving to become an architect. He played rugby at school and then at Newport, earning a place in the 1st XV after several players retired or defected to rugby league. He made 90 appearances for Newport, during which he developed a famous half-back partnership with Llewellyn Lloyd. His debut for Wales, playing alongside Lloyd, was against England in 1900, when Wales won the Triple Crown. He earned selection again in 1901 but was forced to retire from rugby after incurring an injury playing Scotland.\nPhillips enlisted in the 20th (Service) Battalion Royal Fusiliers at the start of the First World War.
