Many of the books in his list were written by himself. In an age of strictly moralizing children's literature, he broke ground with his fairy tales and light-hearted nursery stories and chapbook tales. His is the first printed version (1804) of the tale of Jack and the Beanstalk.Tabart had for an editor Mary Jane Clairmont, the second wife of William Godwin, and maintained close professional relations with the prolific publisher, Sir Richard Phillips.\nThe standard bibliography of Tabart's production is Marjorie Moon, Benjamin Tabart's Juvenile Library: A Bibliography of Books for Children Published, Written, Edited and Sold by Mr. Tabart, 1801\u20131820.
