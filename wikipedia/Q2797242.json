He turned professional in 1946 and was a leading player on the European circuit in the 1950s and 1960s. He topped the Order of Merit, which was then points-based, in 1958, 1960 and 1965. The best season of his regular career in prize money terms was 1963, when he won \u00a37,209. He was past his peak by the time the formal European Tour was introduced in 1972, but finished in the top twenty on the money list in 1973. He played on the European Seniors Tour in for its first seven seasons (1992\u20131998) but his opportunity to make an impact at this level was limited as he was sixty-two by the time the tour was founded. His best season was 1994, when he came fifteenth on the Order of Merit and earned \u00a315,361.\nBetween 1953 and 1969 Hunt represented Great Britain in the Ryder Cup eight times out of nine. His overall win-loss-half record was 6\u201316\u20136, but his record in singles was much better at 4\u20133\u20133. In 1963 his younger brother Geoff was also in the team. He was the non-playing captain of the Great Britain & Ireland teams of 1973 and 1975, both of which were defeated by the United States.\nOne of the courses at Foxhills Golf Club located in Ottershaw, Surrey, is named after Hunt, where he served as head professional for 25 years in the 1980s and 1990s.Hunt died in June 2013 at the age of 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arnold Palmer", "response": ["| \u2212 Bernard Hunt and Harry Weetman"]}, {"page": "Atherstone", "response": ["* Bernard Hunt MBE (1930\u20132013) an English professional golfer"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Bernard Hunt \u2013 BBC Sport 1978"]}, {"page": "Peter Alliss", "response": ["Alliss had a slow start to the 1953 season but had a good July, finishing tied for 9th in the Open Championship and third in the Irish Open. In mid-August, Alliss was included in a group of 17 from which the Ryder Cup team would be chosen. The PGA arranged a series of trial matches at Wentworth starting on 23 September, and Alliss performed well enough that he was included in the team which was announced on 26 September. Alliss was just 22 years old, the second youngest British Ryder Cup player at that time, a few months older than Henry Cotton in 1929. Alliss was paired with Harry Weetman in the opening day foursomes but lost 2&1. Late on the final day, all matches had been completed except for the two singles matches involving Alliss against Jim Turnesa and 23-year-old Bernard Hunt against Dave Douglas. The British team needed 1\u00bd points from these two matches to win the Ryder Cup or a point to tie. Alliss had gone 1 up at the 14th but he 3-putted the 15th while Turnesa got down in two from a bunker. Alliss then went out of bounds at the 17th to give Turnesa the lead. Turnesa was in the trees at the last and still short of the green in 3. However, Alliss, just off the green in 2, fluffed his chip, and eventually halved the hole in 6, to guarantee that the USA would retain the Ryder Cup. In the final match, at the 18th, Bernard Hunt missed a 4-foot putt that he needed to hole to win his match and so the USA won 6\u00bd to 5\u00bd.", "Alliss's first major success came in the 1954 Daks Tournament at Little Aston Golf Club. On the final day he was drawn with Bernard Hunt in the first pair out. Alliss scored 70 in the morning round and 67 in the afternoon. Bobby Locke, the eventual runner-up, was able to see Alliss finishing his final round before he started his own. Three hours after Alliss had finished, Locke need a 4 at the last to tie with Alliss. However, he put his second into a bunker at the front of the green and took 5. Alliss and Hunt had taken 4 hours and 10 minutes for their two rounds of the 6,681 yards course. Alliss said: \"We took all the time we wanted to play our shots, but we walked smartly between the strokes.\" Two weeks later, in the 1954 Open Championship, Alliss improved on his 1953 performance, finishing tied for 8th place. The season ended with Alliss playing for the British Isles against the Rest of Europe in the inaugural Joy Cup.", "|  Bernard Hunt"]}, {"page": "BMW PGA Championship", "response": ["| 1968(op.) || David Talbot|| align=\"center\" |276 || align=center|\u22128 || 5 strokes ||  Bernard Hunt ||Dunbar|| align=\"center\" |", "| 1967(cl.) || Brian Huggett|| align=\"center\" |271 || align=center|\u221213 || 8 strokes ||  Jimmy Hitchcock Bernard Hunt ||Thorndon Park|| align=\"center\" |", "| 1959 || Dai Rees|| align=\"center\" |283 || align=center| || 6 strokes ||  Bernard Hunt David Snell ||Ashburnham|| align=\"center\" |"]}, {"page": "Peter Thomson (golfer)", "response": ["| align=center|12 || 17 Jun 1960 || Yorkshire Evening News Tournament || 70-66-65-67=268 || 5 strokes ||  Bernard Hunt", "| align=center|13 || 20 Jun 1960 || Bowmaker Tournament || 67-65=132 || 1 stroke ||  Bernard Hunt"]}, {"page": "Neil Coles", "response": ["*1970 Sumrie Better-Ball (with Bernard Hunt), Southern Professional Championship, Carlyon Bay Hotel Tournament", "*1973 Sumrie Better-Ball (with Bernard Hunt)"]}, {"page": "World Cup (men's golf)", "response": ["|1960||||Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead||Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland|| \u2013 Bernard Hunt and Harry Weetman"]}, {"page": "Fred Daly (golfer)", "response": ["In September 1953, Daly reached the semi-final of the News of the World Match Play, losing to Dai Rees.
