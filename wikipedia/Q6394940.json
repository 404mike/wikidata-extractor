It is unknown exactly when Williams' assault on Samuels and her two children began, as Pierre Williams has repeatedly denied murder, although police believe it occurred in the early hours. At his trial the prosecution presented overwhelming physical evidence of his involvement. Williams attacked and sexually assaulted Samuels, before assaulting, tying up, raping and murdering Kesha Wizzart. At some point in between the murders, Fred was also beaten to death at his mother's bedside before Williams finished beating Samuels to death. According to investigations, Williams took all three victims' mobile phones and sold them while driving home. Williams called 999 himself, and said that a hooded figure in the house was responsible for the murders."]}, {"page": "List of Stars in Their Eyes episodes", "response": ["| Kesha Wizzart"]}]}}
