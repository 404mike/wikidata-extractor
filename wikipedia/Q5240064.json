Such simple adaptation behaviour might be bacterial intelligence but is clearly not animal intelligence.\" However, plant intelligence fits a definition of intelligence proposed by David Stenhouse in a book about evolution and animal intelligence, in which he describes it as \"adaptively variable behaviour during the lifetime of the individual\". Critics of the concept have also argued that a plant cannot have goals once it is past the developmental stage of seedling because, as a modular organism, each module seeks its own survival goals and the resulting organism-level behavior is not centrally controlled. This view, however, necessarily accommodates the possibility that a tree is a collection of individually intelligent modules cooperating, competing, and influencing each other to determine behavior in a bottom-up fashion. The development into a larger organism whose modules must deal with different environmental conditions and challenges is not universal across plant species, however, as smaller organisms might be subject to the same conditions across their bodies, at least, when the below and aboveground parts are considered separately. Moreover, the claim that central control of development is completely absent from plants is readily falsified by apical dominance."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy of science articles", "response": ["* David Stenhouse"]}, {"page": "Stenhouse", "response": ["*David Stenhouse (born 1932), British evolutionary biologist and ethologist"]}, {"page": "2013 in New Zealand", "response": ["* 27 August \u2013 David Stenhouse, evolutionary biologist (born 1932)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2013", "response": ["*David Stenhouse, 81, English biologist."]}, {"page": "Stenhouse, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Stenhouse"]}]}}
