Closely following Pritchard were the Jones brothers, David (known as 'Ponty' Jones), Jack and 'Tuan'. All three were capped for the Wales team, representing their country over the period 1907\u20131921. As well as representing Wales, Jack and 'Tuan' both played for the British Isles team, making them the first British Lions to be selected from Pontypool.

From this Wales executed a planned move\u2014Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right to Bush. He then turned left and passed to Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then passed to Gabe, who passed to Bush, who eventually passed to Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion\u2014leaving the score at 3\u20130. In the final stages of the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two minutes early, and Wallace that it was three minutes early.", "The All Blacks kicked off for the second half and the two teams were evenly matched. The All Blacks first five-eighth Mynott was having a poor game\u2014dropping the ball frequently. Eventually Roberts stopped passing to him, and would instead run the ball himself. The Welsh had try-scoring opportunities, but drop-goal attempts and dropped passes prevented them scoring. Some time during the second half (various accounts are given\u2014all identifying different times in the match) the All Blacks got their best attacking opportunity of the match. The Welsh won a line-out on the All Blacks side of half-way and, with the resulting ball, kicked diagonally across-field which was fielded by New Zealand's Wallace. Wallace then ran and broke through the Welsh line before confronting their fullback Winfield. Wallace then passed to Deans who was tackled either on, or near the Welsh line. The referee Dallas awarded a scrum to Wales five yards from their line. A contemporary report states \"Morgan sprinted across from the left wing, and helped Winfield to save what otherwise would have been a try by tackling Deans before he grounded the ball, and, though a splendid effort was made by the centre threequarter to straggle over, timely reinforcements came to Morgan, and the ball was grounded between two and three feet from the line, though Deans considers he grounded the ball in goal.Wales v.

In the monumental match between the unbeaten All Blacks and the Triple Crown-winning Welsh team, Morgan is believed to have led his team in singing the Welsh national anthem in response to the New Zealanders' haka. This was the first time a national anthem had been sung at a sporting event. The strongly contested game was decided by a single score. In the twenty-fifth minute, Welsh scrum half Dicky Owen released the ball to Cliff Pritchard, who received the ball at ankle level before darting forward.

From the start of his career, he played on the left wing. In 1899, Williams was invited to play at Newport RFC under the newly appointed captain, Llewellyn Lloyd. Several players had departed, leaving gaps in the backline, and Williams was brought in, alongside Cliff Pritchard and W. Isaacs, while the effective pairing of Lloyd and Lou Phillips at halfback continued. In Williams' first season at Newport, the team scored a total of 416 points compared with the previous season's 192. The following season was Newport's third best on record. However, Williams was injured during the course of the year.

The 1905 winning team is still recognised as one of the strongest Welsh teams in history, centred on a formidable pack. With Wales dominating the Home Nations, the next game was to be the historic encounter with the Original All Blacks, New Zealand's first touring team. Despite being available for the opening game of the 1906 Home Nations Championship less than a month later, Watkins was not selected for the 'Match of the Century', which saw Wales narrowly beat the All Blacks.

As Wales won the ball, Owen ran it down the blindside, with the backline of Bush, Nicholls & Llewellyn following him in support. This initial move drew Gallaher, Hunter and most of the New Zealand backs in that direction. Owen then switched the play, throwing a long pass back to the openside, with Cliff Pritchard having to take the ball at his feet.
