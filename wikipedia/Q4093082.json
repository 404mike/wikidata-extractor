In 1941 he joined the Army and served in Palestine. In 1944 he returned to the Foreign Office. He served as a counsellor in the British Embassy in Baghdad, and was later sent to Venezuela, his only foreign post outside the Arab world.\nIn 1958 Beaumont attended the Imperial Defence College. He then returned to the Foreign Office as head of the Arabian department. He was appointed as ambassador to Morocco in 1961, and ambassador to Iraq in 1965. When the Six-Day War broke out in 1967, the Iraqi government broke off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom, and Beaumont had 48 hours to leave the country. He returned to London, where he was appointed deputy under-secretary of state. He served as ambassador to Egypt from 1969 to 1973, and did much to strengthen Anglo-Egyptian relations. Following his retirement, he headed several organisations dealing with British-Arab relations, such as the Arab British Chamber of Commerce (ABCC) where he served as the Chairman from 1980 to 1996. He was a governor of the School of Oriental and African Studies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Beaumont", "response": ["*Richard Ashton Beaumont (1912\u20132009), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "Richard Beaumont (diplomat)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Ashton Beaumont"]}, {"page": "1955 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Richard Ashton Beaumont, OBE, Counsellor at Her Majesty's Embassy in Baghdad."]}, {"page": "1965 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Richard Ashton Beaumont, , Her Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, in Rabat."]}, {"page": "1949 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Richard Ashton Beaumont, His Majesty's Consul at Jerusalem."]}]}}
