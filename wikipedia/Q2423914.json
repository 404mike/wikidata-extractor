Waghorn claimed to have demonstrated the route for the first time in 1829-30 and that it reduced the journey from over 11,000 miles (18,000 km) to 6,000 miles (9,700 km) and while steamships around the Cape of Good Hope took about three months, his route took between 35 and 45 days. A 2004 biography states that there is little substance to many of the claims that he made and that he was mostly a fraudulent self-publicist. This contradicts an earlier historical study. A statue of him stands in Chatham, Kent while another, now destroyed, was installed at Suez by Ferdinand de Lesseps in 1869.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Suez Canal", "response": ["Before the canal's opening in 1869, goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.Overland Mail by Thomas Fletcher Waghorn, Railway Alexandria \u2013 Cairo \u2013 Suez built by Robert Stephenson"]}, {"page": "Snodland", "response": ["The postal pioneer Thomas Fletcher Waghorn (1800\u201350), shortened the mail route to India from three months to between 35 and 45\u00a0days by going through the Egyptian desert.
