He was a right-handed batsman and a slow bowler; the arm with which he bowled is unknown.\nBethune represented Hampshire in two first-class matches in 1885, which was Hampshire's final season with first-class status until the 1895 County Championship. Bethune's debut match came against Somerset. This was Bethune's only appearance during 1885.\nWith the loss of Hampshire's first-class status, Bethune did not represent the club until 1890, although in a non first-class capacity, making appearances against Staffordshire, Surrey, Leicestershire, Sussex, the Marylebone Cricket Club and Oxfordshire. Bethune's second stint with the club lasted until 1893.\nBy 1897, Hampshire had regained their first-class status. Bethune represented the county in one first-class match in the 1897 County Championship against Lancashire. This was Bethune's last first-class match, during which he took his only first-class wicket, that of Arthur Paul.\nIn 1899, Bethune began playing non first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club, making his debut against Herefordshire. Bethune represented the club eight times up to 1901, with his final appearance for the club coming against the Netherlands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Bethune", "response": ["Henry Bethune may refer to:", "* Henry Bethune (cricketer) (1844\u20131912), English cricketer"]}]}}
