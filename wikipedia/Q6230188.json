In the midst of congested fixture list the Blades finished the season fifth in the league (out of ten sides) and once again resolved to improve the quality of players by recruiting established professionals ahead of the next season.  They duly negotiated the transfers of  John Drummond, Billy Hendry and Samuel Dobson from Preston North End, then one of the top sides in the country, and they arrived over a number of weeks through February and March to bolster United's first team options. The most significant signing during the season was that of a young Ernest Needham from Staveley in February 1891.

After a goalless first half, United forward John Drummond received the ball midway through the second period and embarked on a long solo run before hitting the ball past the Accrington keeper to score the only goal of the game.  Drummond would later attribute his performance in the game to painting the soles of his boots with black lead to prevent the mud from sticking, allowing him to be the only player to be able to keep to his feet.", "| ||FW || John Drummond"]}]}}
