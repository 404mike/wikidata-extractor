Because of the close proximity many players have also represented both the clubs, for example Adam Virgo, Gavin Williams, Dominic Blizzard and Tom Parkes."]}, {"page": "Chris Hackett (footballer)", "response": ["He made his Northampton Town debut, where he started the match before coming off as a substitute in the 56th minute, in a 2\u20131 win over Cardiff City in the first round of the League Cup. A week later on 21 August 2012, Hackett scored his first goal for the club, in a 2\u20131 win over Rotherham United. In a follow up match against Southend United, he set up one of the goals, in a 3\u20133 draw. A week later on 8 September 2012, Hackett scored his second goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win over AFC Wimbledon. Since joining the club, he became a first team regular for the side, playing in the midfield position. Hackett started in every match since the start of the 2012\u201313 season until he suffered a groin injury that saw him missed two matches. He returned to the starting lineup against York City on 6 November 2012, setting up an equalising goal for Adebayo Akinfenwa, in 1\u20131 draw. Having been initially out due to illness, Hackett overcome the obstacles and started the whole game, where he scored and set up one of the goals, in a 3\u20131 win over Wycombe Wanderers on 17 November 2012. His performance earned Hackett the Northampton Audi Player of the Month for December. He later two more goals throughout January against Dagenham & Redbridge and Aldershot Town. Hackett then set up three goals in two matches between 2 February 2013 and 9 February 2013, including twice against Rochdale.

After being sidelined for two matches, he scored on his return on 9 March 2013, in a 2\u20130 win over Accrington Stanley. Hackett, once again, set up two goals in two matches between 23 March 2013 and 29 March 2013, against Oxford United and Torquay United. In the League Two play-offs, he played in both legs, setting up a goal in the first leg, eventually winning 2\u20130 on aggregate against Cheltenham Town to reach the League Two play-off Final. However League Two play-off Final, Hackett started the whole game, as Northampton Town went on to lose 3\u20130 against Bradford City. Hackett went on to make forty-nine appearances, scoring six times in all competitions, during the 2012\u201313 season."]}, {"page": "Clayton McDonald", "response": ["After David Artell left the club, Gareth Owen picked up an injury and Joe Davis suffered a loss of form, McDonald managed to build a solid centre-back partnership with John McCombe at the start of the 2012\u201313 campaign, but was warned to lose weight and improve his fitness by manager Micky Adams. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20132 win against Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn on 3 November, in the First Round of the FA Cup; during the match he also made a goal-line clearance with the score at 2\u20132. Speaking after the game, McDonald said \"I'm just trying to pay back the fans and the manager for all their support in the past with performances on the pitch. Hopefully it's the first of many... hopefully I can catch Tom Pope up. The support they have given me has meant a lot to me. They are a top bunch of people, it's a top area.\" However the arrival of new signings Darren Purse and Liam Chilvers displaced McDonald from the first team picture. On 21 January, he joined Bristol Rovers on loan until the end of the season, as cover for the injured Garry Kenneth. The \"Pirates\" were then bottom of the English Football League, and manager John Ward said that McDonald was \"prepared to come down for the cause [of avoiding relegation] and that's a really big plus for me.\" However McDonald remained on the bench as the \"Gas\" lost only three of their next 15 games, and had to wait until Tom Parkes received a suspension before he finally started a game for the club on 6 April, in a 1\u20130 win at the Memorial Stadium that saw Rovers climb into 11th place. He returned to Vale in time to see the club secure promotion with a third-place finish. He was not offered a new contract at the end of the season and was released as a free agent."]}]}}
