The tradition was continued by Hilliard's pupil Isaac Oliver (c. 1565\u2013bur. 2 October 1617), whose French Huguenot parents had escaped to England in the artist's childhood. Other notable English artists across the period include: Nathaniel Bacon (1585\u20131627); John Bettes the Elder (active c. 1531\u20131570) and John Bettes the Younger (died 1616); George Gower (c.1540\u20131596), William Larkin (early 1580s\u20131619), and Robert Peake the Elder (c. 1551\u20131619). The artists of the Tudor court and their successors until the early 18th century included a number of influential imported talents: Hans Holbein the Younger, Anthony van Dyck, Peter Paul Rubens, Orazio Gentileschi and his daughter Artemisia, Sir Peter Lely (a naturalised English subject from 1662), and Sir Godfrey Kneller (a naturalised English subject by the time of his 1691 knighthood).", "File:William Larkin Sir Francis Bacon 2.jpg|William Larkin's portrait of Sir Francis Bacon; c. 1610."]}, {"page": "Jacobean era", "response": ["The fine arts were dominated by foreign talent in the Jacobean era, as was true of the Tudor and Stuart periods in general.
