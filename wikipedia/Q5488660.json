His strong leadership abilities had a dominating effect on the character of his department, in which he served for all but a few months of his career. His principal interest during this time was the Police service, for which he created the Police Staff College at Bramshill. At his best in a crisis, his contribution to the recovery after the North Sea flood of 1953 was particularly praised.\nA man of great energy and drive, Newsam's tendency to be impatient with those who disagreed with him meant that he was not automatically popular with the Home Secretaries under whom he worked. However, his negotiating ability was superb, and he allowed himself time to enjoy the finer things in life. His eventual successor Philip Allen regarded him as operating in the tradition of preserving the liberty of the subject wherever possible; those who had worked under him also noted his highly prized commitment to keeping the politicians in charge of the department out of trouble at all costs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North Sea flood of 1953", "response": ["In the UK, the Permanent Secretary to the Home Office, Sir Frank Newsam, coordinated the immediate efforts to defend homes, save lives and recover after the floods. After the flooding, the government made major investments in new sea defences. The Thames Barrier programme was started to secure Central London against a future storm surge; the Barrier was officially opened on 8 May 1984. A range of flood defence measures were initiated around the UK coast."]}, {"page": "Philip Allen, Baron Allen of Abbeydale", "response": ["Together with Permanent Under-Secretary Sir Frank Newsam, Allen unsuccessfully urged a reprieve for Derek Bentley, who was hanged aged 19 in 1953 for the murder of a policeman.  Bentley, who was already under arrest at the time, had allegedly called to an armed accomplice, Christopher Craig, \"Let him have it, Chris!\", when they were caught in a burglary. The remark, if made, was ambiguous, possibly urging surrender of Craig's gun, rather than inciting Craig to murder.  In 1998, Bentley received a posthumous pardon. Craig was imprisoned, being under-age for execution, and was later released."]}, {"page": "Ruth Ellis", "response": ["Ellis then said that she had been drinking with Cussen for most of the weekend and that he had given her the gun and some shooting practice.

Lloyd George later said that the police were able to make considerable enquiries but that it made no difference to his decision, and in fact, made Ellis's guilt greater showing the murder was premeditated.Bresler, p. 250.
