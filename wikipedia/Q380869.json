He specialises in hard science fiction and space opera. He spent his early years in Cornwall, moved back to Wales before going to Newcastle University, where he read physics and astronomy. Afterwards, he earned a PhD in astrophysics from the University of St Andrews. In 1991, he moved to Noordwijk in the Netherlands where he met his wife Josette (who is from France). There, he worked for the European Space Research and Technology Centre (part of the European Space Agency) until 2004 when he left to pursue writing full-time. He returned to Wales in 2008 and lives near Cardiff.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bruce Sterling", "response": ["In the early 1980s, Sterling wrote a series of stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe: the Solar System is colonized, with two major warring factions. The Mechanists use a great deal of computer-based mechanical technologies; the Shapers do genetic engineering on a massive scale. The situation is complicated by the eventual contact with alien civilizations; humanity eventually splits into many subspecies, with the implication that some of these vanish from the galaxy, reminiscent of the singularity in the works of Vernor Vinge. The Shaper/Mechanist stories can be found in the collection Crystal Express and the collection Schismatrix Plus, which contains the novel Schismatrix and all of the stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe. Alastair Reynolds identified Schismatrix and the other Shaper/Mechanist stories as one of the greatest influences on his own work."]}, {"page": "Enigma machine", "response": ["* The Enigma machine is used as a key plot element in Century Rain by Alastair Reynolds, set in an alternate Earth where technological research has stagnated and the Enigma is the highest level of encryption available both to civilians and military."]}, {"page": "Ginnungagap", "response": ["in Alastair Reynolds' space opera novel Absolution Gap, the chasm in which the bridge spans is also named by the book's main antagonist."]}, {"page": "Hard science fiction", "response": ["* Alastair Reynolds, Pushing Ice (2005) PushingIce"]}, {"page": "Iain Banks", "response": ["Banks's publisher called him \"an irreplaceable part of the literary world\".

Set in the far future, Ambition centers around a discussion between a master, played by Gillen, discussing the importance of ambition with his apprentice, played by Franciosi, using the Rosetta mission as an example of such. Ambition was premiered at the British Film Institute's Sci-Fi: Days of Fear and Wonder film festival in London on 24 October 2014, three weeks before the landing of Philae on 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko. British science fiction author and former ESA employee Alastair Reynolds spoke about the film's message at the premiere, stating to the audience that \"our distant descendants may look back to Rosetta with the same sense of admiration that we reserve for, say, Columbus or Magellan.\" The film's conception was the result of the BFI's inquiry to the ESA for a contribution to their celebration of science fiction, with the ESA taking the opportunity to promote the Rosetta mission through the festival."]}, {"page": "Berserker (novel series)", "response": ["* Inhibitors, in the fiction of Alastair Reynolds: a formerly organic race, completely converted over to machine form, who are non-sapient, and describe themselves as \"post-intelligent\"."]}, {"page": "Kapteyn's Star", "response": ["The purported planets are close to a 5:2 period commensurability, but resonances could not be confirmed at the time.
