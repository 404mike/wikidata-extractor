His research mainly concerns quantum gravity, black hole physics, general relativity, and supergravity.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "No-hair theorem", "response": ["A study by Stephen Hawking, Malcolm Perry and Andrew Strominger postulates that black holes might contain \"soft hair\", giving the black hole more degrees of freedom than previously thought. This hair permeates at a very low-energy state, which is why it didn't come up in previous calculations that postulated the no-hair theorem. This was the subject of Hawking's final paper which was published posthumously."]}, {"page": "Nathan Myhrvold", "response": ["Myhrvold was born on August 3, 1959 in Seattle, Washington.

Edward Witten gave another proof in 1981 based on the use of spinors, inspired by positive energy theorems in the context of supergravity.

He completed his senior thesis, titled \"The global implications of local violations of the energy conditions\", under the supervision of Malcolm Perry; his thesis addressed topics in the theory of general relativity. He also studied political theory with Jeffrey K. Tulis and constitutional interpretation with Walter F. Murphy, (the latter would inspire Eisgruber to pursue a career in constitutional law). During his junior year at Princeton, he was a member of the Elm Club. After graduating from Princeton, Eisgruber won a Rhodes Scholarship to attend University College, Oxford where he earned an MLitt in politics in 1987. Upon his return from Oxford, Eisgruber attended the University of Chicago Law School where he graduated cum laude with a JD in 1988. While in law school, he served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review."]}]}}
