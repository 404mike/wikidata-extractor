(ed) (1998) Southern People A Dictionary of Otago Southland Biography Dunedin, NZ: Longacre Press with Dunedin City Council. . p. 240. Another is that the name is from the now obsolete English term \"march\" meaning a boundary - in this case a middle area between two rivers. As with many places in and close to the Maniototo area, its name may have been influenced by the Northumberland ancestry of early surveyor John Turnbull Thomson (there is a Middle March region in Northumberland, centred on the town of Otterburn)."]}, {"page": "Strath Taieri", "response": ["Edward Wingfield Humphreys (1841\u20131892) is credited with naming the valley 'Strath Taieri'. Alice Humphreys (n\u00e9e Hawdon, 1848\u20131934) moved to her husband's property in the \"strath\" soon after their marriage in 1869. She is credited with calling the private township laid out on their property 'Middlemarch' after George Eliot's novel.Thomson, 1998, p.240. However this origin of the name has been disputed. From whatever source it got its name, the private township of Middlemarch on Humphrey's property of Garthmyl had been surveyed on land adjoining the projected railway and several sections were already sold by 6 November 1880.Thompson, 1949, pp.44-5. A stone house was built and occupied by Mr. Kirk and his family by the winter of 1881.Thompson, 1949, p.105.
