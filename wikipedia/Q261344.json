Campbell rose to prominence at age nineteen as a member of the Scottish indie pop band Belle & Sebastian, but left the group to pursue a solo career, first as The Gentle Waves, and later under her own name. She later collaborated with singer Mark Lanegan on three albums. Her latest studio album There Is No Other was released via Cooking Vinyl on February 7th 2020. \nCampbell's music has been described as either indie pop, chamber pop or singer-songwriter. Regardless of genre, Campbell makes gentle and sombre music, often using classical instruments and her bright, slightly nasally voice with bittersweet and ironic songwriting.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 27", "response": ["*1976 \u2013 Isobel Campbell, Scottish singer-songwriter and cellist "]}, {"page": "Belle and Sebastian", "response": ["Tigermilk was recorded in three days and originally only one thousand copies were pressed in vinyl.
