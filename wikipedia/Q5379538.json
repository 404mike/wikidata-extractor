His often surreal films were mainly filmed in and around the town of Wishaw in Scotland, where his family owned the popular Belhaven Cafe. These include Chick's Day (1950), a prize winner at the 1951 Scottish Amateur Film Festival, The Living Ghost (1957), and Glasgow's Docklands (1959). Illness later forced him to give up making films and he spent most of his working life teaching at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. In 2001 he was the subject of the Channel 4 documentary Artery: the Story of Enrico Cocozza.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921", "response": ["** Enrico Cocozza, Scottish filmmaker (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Enrico Cocozza"]}, {"page": "Wishaw", "response": ["*Enrico Cocozza, underground filmmaker", "*  Scenes at West Cross Enrico Cocozza interviews local people."]}, {"page": "Enrico", "response": ["* Enrico Cocozza (1921\u20131997), Scottish filmmaker"]}, {"page": "Cocozza", "response": ["*Enrico Cocozza (1921\u20132009), Scottish filmmaker in 1940s\u20131950s"]}]}}
