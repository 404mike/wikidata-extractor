Octavius was tutored at home by William Barnes, then studied theology at the University of Durham.  He was ordained in 1858, succeeding his father at Bloxworth in 1868. In 1857 he presented the Pickard-Cambridge Challenge Cup to University College Boating Club, University of Durham for a skiff race; it was re-presented in 1895 for college second trial fours.His main interest was in spiders, though he wrote also on birds and lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). This passion for arachnids was probably fostered in 1854 in which year he both accompanied the entomologist Frederick Bond on a visit to the New Forest in Hampshire and was introduced to the writings of the arachnologist John Blackwall, with whom he struck up a correspondence, meeting for the first time in 1860. Pickard-Cambridge assisted Blackwall between 1861 and 1864 in the publication of Blackwell's great work, British and Irish Spiders.\nPickard-Cambridge himself published extensively on spiders between 1859 and his death in 1917, his major work being the volume on arachnids in the Biologia Centrali-Americana between 1883 and 1902. Of his other works, The Spiders of Dorset was perhaps his best-known, much of his other writing being in the form of papers in The Zoologist, the journals of the Linnean Society and the Zoological Society, and in the Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club. He became a world authority on spiders, describing a considerable number of new species including the Costa Rican redleg tarantula (Megaphobema mesomelas) and the Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus).\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 9 September 1887. On his death, his collection and library were bequeathed to the University of Oxford and is now held by Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\nPickard-Cambridge married Rose Wallace in 1866, and they had six sons. Among them were the classicist and composer William Adair Pickard-Cambridge (1879\u20131957) and the classicist Sir Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge (1873\u20131952), one of the greatest authorities on the Greek theatre in the first half of the 20th century. His nephew, Frederick Octavius Pickard-Cambridge, (1860\u20131905) was also a noted arachnologist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Frederick Octavius Pickard-Cambridge (1860\u20131905), English entomologist, expert on spiders", "*Octavius Pickard-Cambridge (1828\u20131917), English entomologist,Abbreviation in zoology: Pickard-Cambridge mainly interested in spiders, but also on birds, butterflies and moths"]}, {"page": "Australian funnel-web spider", "response": ["The first atracid spider, Hadronyche cerberea, was described by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1873.

Octavius Pickard-Cambridge was the first to describe the Sydney funnel-web spider, from a female specimen housed in the British Museum in 1877. Establishing the genus Atrax, he named it Atrax robustus. The species name is derived from the Latin robustus, \"strong/sturdy/mature\". Some years later, William Joseph Rainbow described a male Sydney funnel-web as a new species\u2014Euctimena tibialis\u2014from a spider he found under a log in Turramurra, and another from Mosman. He coined the scientific name from Ancient Greek euktimenos, \"well-built\", and Latin tibialis, \"of the tibia\", having noted its prominent tibial spur. In the same paper, he described a female Sydney funnel-web spider as yet another species\u2014Poikilomorpha montana\u2014from a specimen collected from Jamison Valley and Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains. Its species name was derived from poikilomorphia, \"variety of form\", referring to the eyes of different sizes, and montana, \"of the mountains\". In February 1927, a young boy died after being bitten on the hand after playing with a big black spider on the laundry steps of his home in the Sydney suburb of Thornleigh. He fell gravely ill and perished later that evening. Public interest in the spiders surged, and the police brought the dead spider to the Australian Museum, where Anthony Musgrave identified the creature as Euctimena tibialis. He examined a series of male and female spiders collected around Sydney and concluded based on anatomical similarities that Euctimena tibialis was the male Atrax robustus.
