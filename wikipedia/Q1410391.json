It concluded that the decision to drop the original report was \"flawed\", but that it had not been done to protect programmes prepared as tributes to Savile. Pollard's report criticised George Entwistle for apparently failing to read emails warning him of Savile's \"dark side\", and stated that, after the allegations against Savile eventually became public, the BBC fell into a \"level of chaos and confusion [that] was even greater than was apparent at the time\".

The report, by Stuart Prebble, stated that Helen Boaden, the former director of BBC News, had said that when she arrived at the organisation, there had been a \"deep liberal bias\" in the handling of immigration issues. It also stated that, within the BBC, \"the agenda of debate is probably too driven by the views of politicians\" but that \"overall the breadth of opinion reflected by the BBC on this subject is broad and impressive, and no persuasive evidence was found that significant areas of opinion are not given due weight today\". It also stated that the BBC was \"slow to give appropriate prominence to the growing weight of opinion opposing UK membership of the EU, but in more recent times has achieved a better balance\".", "BBC News defended Plett in a statement by saying that her reporting had met the high standards of \"fairness, accuracy and balance\" expected of a BBC correspondent.Gibson, Owen (26 November 2005). \"BBC bias complaint upheld\".

Despite initially issuing a statement in support of Plett, the BBC Director of News, Helen Boaden, later apologised for what she described as \"an editorial misjudgment\".
