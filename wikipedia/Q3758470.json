The game ended 2\u20131 to Southampton after a brace of goals from Rickie Lambert, including a final-minute winner, reversed the initial Exeter lead. Daniel Nardiello opened the scoring for the home side just before half time, and it took until 20 minutes before the end for the visitors to come back, when Lambert headed in a cross from new signing Dany N'Guessan to equalise. Lambert doubled his tally in the last minute of normal time, heading in another cross this time from returning midfielder Dean Hammond. On 5 February Southampton dropped two points in the return match against Peterborough United, sharing the spoils in an eight-goal thriller. The visitors started off the game well, going 2\u20130 up within half an hour following a Richard Chaplow goal and a Rickie Lambert penalty, but in the last six minutes of the first half Peterborough equalised with strikes from Craig Mackail-Smith and Chris Whelpdale. Lambert scored a second penalty just after the break to extend his lead as the club's top scorer of the season, and returning captain Dean Hammond restored the Saints' two-goal lead just three minutes later. A further two penalties for Peterborough led to a 4\u20134 draw, with the final goal coming from Lee Tomlin in the third minute of injury time at the end of the match. A week later the Saints reduced Huddersfield Town's lead in 3rd place of the table when they defeated Carlisle United 1\u20130 at home in a relatively uneventful game. The game was initially brought alive within the last five minutes of the first half, when Carlisle defender Gary Borrowdale was sent off after receiving a second booking for arguing with the assistant referee, after which Rickie Lambert scored his 50th Southampton goal by heading in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross. In the second half, further chances were limited and Southampton nervously picked up three points while Huddersfield played out a goalless draw with Oldham Athletic meaning Southampton could go ahead of Huddersfield should they win their game-in-hand. Southampton remained fifth with several games in hand over Peterborough, Huddersfield and Bournemouth after drawing 0\u20130 with Hartlepool United on 22 February. Southampton upheld their unbeaten league run at the weekend, beating Swindon Town 4\u20131 at home in a convincing performance marked by only five minutes of Swindon dominance in the second half. Adam Lallana opened the scoring for the home side after just 15 minutes, and chances for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Guly do Prado could have increased the scoreline going into half-time. In the second half, winger Matt Ritchie equalised for Swindon, but his effort was cancelled out within minutes when Rickie Lambert and Radhi Ja\u00efdi both scored from set pieces within two minutes of one another to make it 3\u20131. With more chances for Saints in the later stages of the game, substitute Lee Barnard eventually confirmed the win for Southampton with a goal in stoppage time."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Gary Borrowdale", "|  Gary Borrowdale", "| 26 || DF ||  ||align=left| Gary Borrowdale || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1", "| 26 || DF ||  || Gary Borrowdale || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|18||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Gary Borrowdale"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Borrowdale", "|Gary Borrowdale"]}, {"page": "South London derby", "response": ["* Gary Borrowdale"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["|Gary Borrowdale (On loan from QPR)", "| Gary Borrowdale"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Gary Borrowdale"]}, {"page": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.\u2013Crystal Palace F.C. rivalry", "response": ["| Gary Borrowdale || Crystal  Palace  ||  2002\u20132007   ||  2009 (loan)"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|16 May 2014||DF|| Gary Borrowdale||Released||Free||"]}, {"page": "Crystal Palace F.C.
