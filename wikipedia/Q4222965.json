Instead of big tournaments, he had to play UK Tour tournaments this year. His best result was the quarter-finals in tournament 4. In 1998/99 he returned to the Main Tour and had his greatest success in the UK Championship. He defeated Darren Clarke and top-64 player Nick Pearce and reached the main tournament in Bournemouth. There he lost the first round match against Andy Hicks 6\u20139. At the China International, he reached the round of the last 96 and two more times the last 134.
