Lloyd noted would that he attached a rifle to a scope, rather than the more normal saying of attaching a scope to a rifle.\nShooting Times voted the Lloyd rifle number 8 in its list of the top 12 Rifles of All Time, and Country Life magazine described Lloyd himself as \u201ca National Living Treasure\u201d.  Lloyd rifles are owned by riflemakers Bill Ruger and Roy Weatherby, and by several owners of Scottish deer forests.\nIn his deer-stalking career of over 60 years, Lloyd killed more than 5,000 Scottish highland red deer stags, the vast majority of them with rifles built by his company.\nLloyd's wife Evadne (\u201cBobby\u201d, the longest-serving governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company in its history) keenly supported him in his business, and helped him to source fine walnut blanks for his rifle stocks from various European sources. On Lloyd's death in 1996 she took on the business, which by then was doing little trade, and ran it until her own death in 2003, when the company was sold to John Shirley, formerly Technical Manager with James Purdey and Sons of London. He subsequently offered the business name, goodwill and records of the David Lloyd company for sale at auction in London in December 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Lloyd", "response": ["David Lloyd may refer to:", "* David Lloyd (biographer) (1635\u20131692), author of Lloyd's Memoirs of Excellent Personages", "* David Lloyd (tenor) (1912\u20131969), British tenor", "* David Lloyd (writer) (1934\u20132009), American television writer", "* David Lloyd (comics) (born 1950), illustrator of the graphic novel V for Vendetta", "* David Lloyd (actor) (born 1955), English actor and screenwriter", "* David Lloyd (broadcaster), British radio broadcaster", "* David Lloyd (musician), singer with Uropa Lula", "* David Lloyd (sportscaster), SportsCenter anchor for ESPN", "* David Lloyd (footballer, born 1872), for Thames Ironworks", "* David Lloyd (footballer, born 1928) (1928\u20132000), for York City", "* David Lloyd (riflemaker and sportsman) (1910\u20131996)", "* David Lloyd (cricketer), (born 1947), known as \"Bumble\", England Test cricketer, coach, and commentator", "* David Lloyd (cricketer, born 1992), Glamorgan cricketer", "* David Lloyd (tennis) (born 1948), founder of the David Lloyd Tennis Clubs", "* David Lloyd (squash player) (born 1965)", "* David Lloyd (Dean of St Asaph) (1597\u20131663), Welsh cleric and author of The Legend of Captain Jones", "* David Lloyd (priest) (c. 1688\u20131747?), Welsh cleric and translator", "* David Lloyd (judge) (1656\u20131731), chief justice of colonial Pennsylvania", "* David Lloyd (botanist) (1937\u20132006), New Zealand plant scientist and victim of poisoning scandal", "* David Lloyd (diplomat) (born 1940), British ambassador to Slovenia", "* David Lloyd (Welsh politician) (born 1956), Welsh politician", "* David Lloyd (chemist) (born 1974), Irish chemist and Vice Chancellor of the University of South Australia", "* David Lloyd (academic), professor of English and political activist", "* David Lloyd (police commissioner), British police commissioner", "* David Lloyd Leisure, a franchise of gym and racquet clubs in UK and western Europe", "*David Lloyd Jones (disambiguation)", "*David Lloyd George (1863\u20131945), Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War I"]}, {"page": "William B.

Stalking on extremely steep deer forests such as his own at Glencassley, Lloyd was in search of a \"canyon rifle\" cartridge that would shoot exceptionally fast and with a very flat trajectory across deep valleys and over distances out to  and more, to make range estimation less critical for accurate bullet placement, and to deliver a hard-hitting bullet weighing a minimum of 100 grains.

H&H quickly adopted it, the cartridge acquired the prestigious \"H&H\" appellation, and both H&H and David Lloyd went on to build significant numbers of very high quality bolt-action deer-stalking rifles in .244 H&H Magnum calibre (see Lloyd rifle).

Commercially, this cartridge has only ever been loaded with  bullets: lighter- and heavier-bulleted loads have been created by handloaders.", "David Lloyd, the .244's originator, went on to develop a still more powerful prototype round by reducing the case body taper and increasing the already large power capacity to produce the \"David Lloyd 6 mm Magnum\".
