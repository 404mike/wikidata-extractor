Lloyd noted would that he attached a rifle to a scope, rather than the more normal saying of attaching a scope to a rifle.\nShooting Times voted the Lloyd rifle number 8 in its list of the top 12 Rifles of All Time, and Country Life magazine described Lloyd himself as \u201ca National Living Treasure\u201d.  Lloyd rifles are owned by riflemakers Bill Ruger and Roy Weatherby, and by several owners of Scottish deer forests.\nIn his deer-stalking career of over 60 years, Lloyd killed more than 5,000 Scottish highland red deer stags, the vast majority of them with rifles built by his company.\nLloyd's wife Evadne (\u201cBobby\u201d, the longest-serving governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company in its history) keenly supported him in his business, and helped him to source fine walnut blanks for his rifle stocks from various European sources. On Lloyd's death in 1996 she took on the business, which by then was doing little trade, and ran it until her own death in 2003, when the company was sold to John Shirley, formerly Technical Manager with James Purdey and Sons of London. He subsequently offered the business name, goodwill and records of the David Lloyd company for sale at auction in London in December 2006.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
