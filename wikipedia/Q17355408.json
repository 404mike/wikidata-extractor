He had a particular talent for seafaring characters, which gave rise to the phrase \"in the style \u00e0 la Tom Cooke\".Beausang (2013), as above. He was also involved in productions at Lyceum and Haymarket theatres and at Covent Garden. Cooke was music director of the Vauxhall Gardens concerts (1828\u201330) and the principal tenor at the chapel of the Bavarian embassy in Warwick Street until 1838. Having published a singing tutor in 1828, he also became a much-demanded singing teacher, numbering among his pupils later celebrities including Elizabeth Rainforth, John Sims Reeves, John Templeton, Margaretta Graddon, Maria Tree, and others. Cooke died at his home in Great Portland Street in 1848 and was buried at Kensal Green."]}, {"page": "Gradon", "response": ["*Margaretta Graddon, British singer"]}]}}
