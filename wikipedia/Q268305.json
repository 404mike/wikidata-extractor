A \"woman of letters\" who published in multiple genres, Barbauld had a successful writing career at a time when women rarely wrote professionally. \nShe was a noted teacher at the Palgrave Academy and an innovative writer of works for children. Her primers provided a model for more than a century. Her essays showed it was possible for a woman to be engaged in the public sphere; other women authors such as Elizabeth Benger emulated her. Barbauld's literary career spanned numerous periods in British literary history: her work promoted the values of the enlightenment and of sensibility, while her poetry made a founding contribution to the development of British Romanticism. Barbauld was also a literary critic. Her anthology of 18th-century novels helped to establish the canon as it is known today.\nThe publication of Eighteen Hundred and Eleven in 1812, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars received negative reviews after which she continued to write poetry but not publish in the public sphere. Barbauld's reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the 19th century, and largely forgotten in the 20th, until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman", "response": ["Although female conservatives such as Hannah More excoriated Wollstonecraft personally, they actually shared many of the same values. As the scholar Anne Mellor has shown, both More and Wollstonecraft wanted a society founded on \"Christian virtues of rational benevolence, honesty, personal virtue, the fulfillment of social duty, thrift, sobriety, and hard work\".Mellor, 147. During the early 1790s, many writers within British society were engaged in an intense debate regarding the position of women in society. For example, the respected poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld and Wollstonecraft sparred back and forth; Barbauld published several poems responding to Wollstonecraft's work and Wollstonecraft commented on them in footnotes to the Rights of Woman.Mellor, 153. The work also provoked outright hostility. The bluestocking Elizabeth Carter was unimpressed with the work.Gordon, 154 Thomas Taylor, the Neoplatonist translator who had been a landlord to the Wollstonecraft family in the late 1770s, swiftly wrote a satire called A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes: if women have rights, why not animals too?"]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\u20131825, E)", "*Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743\u20131825, E)"]}, {"page": "March 9", "response": ["*1825 \u2013 Anna Laetitia Barbauld, English poet, author, and critic (b. 1743)"]}, {"page": "Ozymandias", "response": ["* \"Eighteen Hundred and Eleven\", a poem by Anna Laetitia Barbauld which also imagines future tourists visiting a ruined London"]}, {"page": "Ralph Waldo Emerson", "response": ["In late 1874, Emerson published an anthology of poetry entitled Parnassus, which included poems by Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Julia Caroline Dorr, Jean Ingelow, Lucy Larcom, Jones Very, as well as Thoreau and several others.Richardson, p. 570.
