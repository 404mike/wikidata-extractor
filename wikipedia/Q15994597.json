Her parents were the Channel Islands naturalist, collector and antiquarian Frederick Lukis by his wife and first cousin Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Collings). Due to the early 19th-century views on female education, Collings and her sisters probably did not receive any formal schooling. Her interest in lichens was most likely due to the influence of her father, from whom she probably inherited many of the local specimens; her brother, William Collings Lukis, also shared their father's interests. Collings swapped her specimens with other collectors, including the family friend, Charles du Bois Larbalestier of Jersey, eventually amassing a collection of over 1,300 lichens held in a set of 32 folders and small box files. She also took time in 1862 to compile a list of 150 species of lichens that appear on the island of Guernsey, and presented it to the geologist David T. Ansted, who was working on a book about the Channel Islands."]}, {"page": "Frederick Corbin Lukis", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Lukis"]}]}}
