A simulation of The Open Championship, it allows the player to engage in multiple forms of golf, including stroke play and fourball. The player competes at reproductions of the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews as and against famous golfers of the time. Announcer commentary is provided by actor Michael Bradshaw and Wide World of Sports host Jim McKay.", "Looking Glass officially announced British Open Championship Golf on July 18, 1996. Coinciding with this news, the company launched a website to cover The Open Championship of 1996; it detailed both current events and the history of the tournament and its courses. According to Bradford, the company was \"hoping to make a splash\" with the game, which was placed in competition with popular series such as Links and PGA Tour. He noted the quality of these titles, and stated that, had the team not been trying to innovate, they would not have attempted to compete in the genre. Looking Glass revealed in November 1996 that Jim McKay, host of the Wide World of Sports, would provide color commentary for the game. Actor Michael Bradshaw was hired as the play-by-play announcer. The pair recorded more than 5,000 lines of dialogue in total. In January 1997, Looking Glass and Eidos Interactive announced a four-year partnership. As a result, British Open Championship Golf was distributed and marketed in North America and published in Europe by Eidos. However, like Flight Unlimited and Terra Nova, the game was self-published in North America by Looking Glass. In March 1997, near the end of the game's development, part of the team moved to Thief: The Dark Project; this included Mark Lizotte, who became that game's lead artist. British Open Championship Golf was released on April 30, 1997. That May, Looking Glass collaborated with golf website GolfWeb to host a \"Virtual British Open\" tournament. Players competed in the game to win a trip to The Open Championship in Scotland, complete with \"air fare, hotel accommodations and spending money.\"", "Jeff Guinn of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called its graphics \"exceptional\", and considered the game to be \"far from the traditional aim/swing links pseudo-challenge.\" However, he found the game extremely difficult, thanks to its faithful reproductions of the challenging Old Course and Royal Troon. As a result, he considered the game to be ultimately \"too much of a good thing.\" A writer for the Telegraph-Herald praised its courses, and stated that its gameplay was a \"state-of-the-art simulation\". The reviewer believed that the tournament atmosphere had been \"re-created faithfully.\" Gary Whitta of PC Gamer US praised the game's graphics and atmosphere. While he liked its gameplay, he noted that it lacked the genre refinements seen in Links LS, a decision he believed would appeal to genre novices but not to veterans. He disliked Michael Bradshaw's commentary, but praised Jim McKay's for \"adding much to the overall feel.\" Ending his review, Whitta summarized it as \"one of the most user-friendly, accessible, atmospheric and attractive golf games out there\"."]}, {"page": "1933 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 18 April \u2013 Michael Bradshaw, actor (died 2001)"]}, {"page": "Adaptations of A Christmas Carol", "response": ["* A Christmas Carol (1993 to the present), a theatrical adaptation at the Public Theatre in Lewiston, Maine adapted by Christopher Schario, Executive and Artistic Director of the Public Theatre.
