In 1981 he returned to Berkshire to work on the Maddle Farm Project with Martin (Mog) Tingle. The Maddle Farm Project was a survey aimed at studying the prehistoric and Roman settlement of the Berkshire Downs and gained some recognition for its detailed reconstruction of the economy of a single villa at Maddle Farm from the distribution of surface artefacts. Following work at Maddle Farm, from 1983 Gaffney worked at Bordesley Abbey and at the Forge Mill Museum in Redditch. In 1985 he decided to return to academic archaeology and to take a PhD, initially with John Bintliff and Bo\u017eidar Slap\u0161ak. Funded by the British Council, as a bilateral agreement with Yugoslavia, and then the British Academy, he intended to work on the hillfort at Rodik on the Slovenian karst.  As this was not possible he moved his research area to the island of Hvar and to work with Branko Kirigin and Nik\u0161a Vujnonovi\u0107.
