The affair was described by Peter Kellner as  \"another fix\" in order \"to ensure Alun Michael became Labour's leader in Wales\" which Kellner said \"offended so many voters that it lost some of its safest seats, including Rhondda, to Plaid Cymru\". Tony Blair's favourable treatment of Michael was later described by Kellner as a \"determination to foist Alun Michael on the people of Wales\", which \"produced a spectacular collapse of support\". Michael stressed his Welsh credentials, as someone who had grown up in North Wales, lived for 30 years in South Wales and was a speaker of Welsh. He had approached Blair at a very early stage to suggest he stood for the Welsh Assembly elections."]}, {"page": "Peter Hitchens", "response": ["After being shortlisted in 2007Martin Moore for the Frontline Club. 1 May 2007 The Orwell Prize 2007.
