Despite Westley criticising his players with some \"harsh words\", saying he was \"not prepared to tolerate that sort of rubbish anymore\", Newport went on to lose eight successive games, which Westley described as \"embarrassing\" and \"humiliating\". Club secretary Graham Bean resigned in December, saying \"Graham Westley is an impossible man to work with... he needs to learn some manners and start treating people with some respect\". Shortly afterwards Westley again courted controversy after refusing to leave opposition manager Derek Adams's press conference. He signed 14 players in the January transfer window, a move he admitted was a \"short-term risk\". However, he failed to arrest the team's declining fortunes and was sacked on 9 March 2017 with Newport 11 points adrift at the bottom of League Two. The club's board said that they had consulted both fans and the players over their decision to sack Westley; he had been confronted by irate supporters at Rodney Parade and after his sacking transfer-listed midfielder Mark Randall came out to say he had been \"treated quite unfairly\" by Westley. Caretaker-manager Michael Flynn managed to organise an unlikely escape from relegation for the \"Exiles\" after overseeing seven victories in the remaining 12 games of the 2016\u201317 season."]}, {"page": "Nacer Barazite", "response": ["Barazite made his competitive Arsenal first-team d\u00e9but on 31 October 2007, as a substitute for Eduardo da Silva against Sheffield United in a League Cup Fourth Round match.
