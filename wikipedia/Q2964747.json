Still seeking to pursue the Lucifer Rising project, he found a young man named Leslie Huggins to be Lucifer. Although enthusiastic about this new actor, stating that he was \"a natural star and absolutely perfect for the part\", Huggins soon abandoned the project and Anger. After the disastrous events of the Altamont Free Concert in December 1969, in which a fan brandishing a handgun was killed by Hells Angels, Jagger began to distance himself from Anger. Instead, he offered his brother Chris Jagger for the role of Lucifer, which Anger accepted. The director Donald Cammell was cast in the role of the god Osiris. Anger cast British singer Marianne Faithfull in the role of the goddess Lilith, while her brother Chris was hired as photographer, and the Rolling Stones' personal photographer, Michael Cooper, was also hired to help with the photography. Anger convinced fashion designer Laura Jameson to create the film's costumes and play the role of a priestess in it.", "To attract press attention, Anger arranged a photo shoot at his basement flat, in which a number of other film directors were in attendance, among them Cammell herself, Dennis Hopper, and Alejandro Jodorowsky. Anger proceeded to film eight minutes of footage in which he played the role of a magus dancing around a magic circle; he titled this Lucifer Rising, Part I, and used it to convince the National Film Finance Corporation to provide him with \u00a315,000 to complete the rest of the film. This action sparked some controversy in the conservative press, with the Sunday Telegraph publishing a March 1971 headline of \"Devil Film to Get State Aid\". With this monetary backing, Anger flew the cast out to both Exernsteine in GermanyKracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), p. 189. and Egypt to get more footage for the film, with The Evening Standard sending a reporter to write an article on their filming in Egypt.
