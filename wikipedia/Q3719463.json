He went to Bradford Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge where he graduated as Wrangler (B-star) in 1914. In 1924 he became Reader at the London School of Economics where he remained until he retired in 1958. He wrote for Biometrika and the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, and Edgeworth called him a \"pathbreaker\" (see obituary by Grebenik).\nRhodes originated the Rhodes algorithm in linear programming. He worked with Arthur Bowley, and also with Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders on his study of juvenile delinquency, and he contributed to population studies and the statistical study of examinations (see his book with Sir Philip John Hartog entitled An Examination of Examinations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Lyon Bowley", "response": ["After leaving Cambridge Bowley taught mathematics at St John's School in Leatherhead from 1893 to 1899. Meanwhile, he was publishing in economic statistics; his first article for the journal of the Royal Statistical Society) appeared in 1895. In that year the London School of Economics opened. Bowley was appointed as a part-time lecturer and he would be connected with the School until he retired in 1936. He can be considered one of the School's intellectual fathers. However, he continued to teach elsewhere; for more than a decade he taught at University College, Reading (now the University of Reading). He was the Newmarch lecturer at University College London (1897\u201398 and 1927\u201328). At the LSE he became Reader in 1908, and Professor in 1915. In 1919, he was appointed to a newly established Chair of Statistics, probably the first of its kind in Britain. In Bowley's time, however, the LSE statistics group was very small: E. C. Rhodes arrived in 1924 and R. G. D. Allen in 1928.."]}, {"page": "Rhodes (surname)", "response": ["*E. C.

Rhodes"]}, {"page": "Philip Hartog", "response": ["On settling in London Hartog devoted much time and thought to the place of examinations in the education system. As early as 1911, and again in 1918, he had written treatises on examinations in their bearing on national efficiency and on culture and general efficiency. He was the dominant figure in an inquiry on an international scale undertaken in 1932. This resulted in the issue in 1935 of An Examination of Examinations. In this exposure of haphazard methods and plans for reform, he had the collaboration of Dr. E. C. Rhodes and also, in a subsequent book, The Marks of Examiners, of Dr. Rhodes and of Mr. Cyril Burt. Deeply impressed by his experience of the need for systematic education research, he obtained from the Leverhulme Trust in 1940 a grant of \u00a32,000 to the University of London Institute of Education for this purpose. The organisation thereby set up was renamed in 1945 the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales, and in 1947 it applied for a royal charter. Hartog was also the prime mover in the setting up by the Ministry of Labour and National Service before the outbreak of war in 1939 of a Linguistic Committee of the Appointments Registry, and he was its first chairman. In 1933 Hartog wrote, under the authority of the London Institute of Education his valuable study, \"Some Aspects of Indian Education, Past, and Present.\" He continued his activities well into his ninth decade, and one of the last of his books, \"Words in Action,\" was published in 1945."]}]}}
