Cliff Richard and Tom Jones had earlier bought homes on the St George's Hill estate. Though reportedly not liking Kenwood (describing it as a \"stop-over\" on the way to something better), Lennon spent \u00a340,000 (were it cash for ordinary expenditure ) on renovations, reducing its 22 rooms to 17, landscaping the grounds, and building an outdoor swimming pool. Much of the initial decoration was left to interior designer Kenneth Partridge, whom Lennon employed after being impressed by his design work at a lavish party held by Beatles' manager Brian Epstein to celebrate the Beatles' departure for their first tour of the United States. However, when Partridge had completed his work, Lennon and then-wife Cynthia immediately made a number of further alterations which better reflected their taste. Cynthia's mother was given an allowance to fill the shelves of the house with antiques and antiquarian books, and a heavy sliding wooden door was installed at the gate entrance to keep out fans."]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Kenneth Partridge, 89, interior decorator."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2015", "response": ["*Kenneth Partridge, 89, English interior decorator."]}, {"page": "Partridge (surname)", "response": ["*Kenneth Partridge (1926\u20132015), English interior designer"]}]}}
