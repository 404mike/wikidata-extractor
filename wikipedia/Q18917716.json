The novel was first written just after the success of a gypsy trilogy published by British novelist Hannah Maria Jones (1784\u20131854).  The motif of gypsies, particularly in the fictional role of kidnappers, was popular in nineteenth-century Victorian literature.Poovey, Mary (Fall 2000). \"Recovering Ellen Pickering.\" The Yale Journal of Criticism, 13 (2): 437-452. . Nan Darrell, or The Gypsy Mother features a lead gypsy character reminiscent of Meg Merrilies from Scott's novel Guy Mannering."]}]}}
