He served in North America, before being appointed to HMS Arrogant in 1852 on the Home Station.He commanded HMS Juno on the Australian Station from 1853 to 1857.

He served aboard HMS Phaeton starting December 28, 1849, and on HMS Winchester since March 22, 1852. On June 27, 1855, he was transferred to HMS Juno where he frequently clashed with captain Stephen Grenville Fremantle, which contributed to prematurely ending Fremantle's career. Burnaby was transferred to HMS Sans Pareil on December 31, 1859. On August 20, 1861, he was promoted to Commander, and became commanding agent of a contract mail steamer on November 20, 1861.

In 1861 this egg (specimen BM(NH) 1988.4.3) was described as Megapodius burnabyi by George Robert Gray. It was subsequently assigned to Megapodius freycinet or Megapodius pritchardii by most authors. However, the former species does not occur anywhere near Tonga today, and probably never did even in the past when it may have been more widespread. M. pritchardii, by contrast, formerly inhabited many islands of Tonga, including Lifuka and most other large islands of the Ha\u02bbapai group, as evidenced by subfossil remains. Additionally, the extinct Megapodius molistructor or a close relative is also known from prehistoric remains found on Lifuka. But this species was huge, one of the largest megapodes known to date and far exceeding M. pritchardii in size. M. alimentum on the other hand was of medium size by Megapodius standards, about 30% larger than M. pritchardii. The M. burnabyi egg was restudied by SteadmanSteadman, D.W.

He found it to be much like typical M. pritchardii eggs; however, it is fairly long by comparison but remarkably narrow, resulting in an elongated shape that is rare in Megapodius: while M. freycinet and M. pritchardii eggs are typically 1.65 times as long as they are wide, the M. burnabyi egg is 1.76 times as long as it is wide. Small eggs of M. pritchardii, however, may occasionally have an elongated shape like Burnaby's specimen."]}, {"page": "HMS Wanderer (1835)", "response": ["In 1842 Stephen Grenville Fremantle, brother of Admiral Charles Fremantle was captain."]}]}}
