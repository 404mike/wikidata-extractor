He played as a midfielder.\nOates began his career with Ron Suart's Blackpool in 1961. He made his debut for the Division One club on 16 September 1961, in a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Nottingham Forest. He made just three more league appearances during the 1961\u201362 campaign, but scored Blackpool's goal in their 1\u20131 draw with Leyton Orient in their League Cup second round, first leg tie on 4 October 1961.\nIn 1962\u201363, Oates made only one appearance in the entire season \u2013 goalless draw at Sheffield Wednesday on 27 October 1962.\nThe following season, 1963\u201364, he made 25 league appearances and scored eight goals. On four occasions, a single strike by Oates was enough to give Blackpool a victory: against Fulham at Bloomfield Road on 30 September 1963; against West Bromwich Albion at home on 16 November, against Stoke City, again at Bloomfield Road, on 8 February 1964; and at Nottingham Forest in the very next game seven days later. He also scored one goal in the League Cup, in Blackpool's 7\u20131 second-round victory over Charlton Athletic at Bloomfield Road on 25 September 1963.\nIn 1964\u201365, Oates made 30 appearances and scored twelve goals in the league, finishing second-top scorer behind Ray Charnley.\nOates' strike-rate dried up in 1965\u201366, with only one goal in 21 league appearances, and in the first two-thirds of the 1966\u201367 campaign, Ron Suart gave Oates only three starts. Stan Mortensen replaced Suart in the Blackpool hot seat in the New Year, and the former Blackpool striker provided more opportunities in the team. Oates scored in the final league game of the season, a 3\u20131 victory against Liverpool at Anfield on 13 May 1967. Blackpool, however, had already been relegated to Division Two at that point.\nIn Stan Mortensen's first full season in charge, 1967\u201368, Oates made 23 league appearances and scored three goals (all of which came in victories).\nOates' final appearance for Blackpool occurred seven games into the 1968\u201369 season, in a single-goal victory over Bolton Wanderers at Bloomfield Road on 7 September 1968.\nHe joined Grimsby Town, with whom he went on to make 81 league appearances and score nine goals in three years.\nOates also played for Wigan Athletic in the early 1970s, scoring 30 goals in 100 Northern Premier League appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Graham Oates (born 1943), footballer"]}, {"page": "Scunthorpe", "response": ["* Graham Oates, is an English former professional footballer.

He began his career as a part-time professional in English non-league football with Cheshire County League side Ellesmere Port Town, playing as a winger. Manager Jimmy Harris switched him to centre forward after seeing the amount of goals he scored. A financial crisis at Ellesmere resulted in a move to Northern Premier League side Northwich Victoria. He was sold on to league rivals Wigan Athletic for \u00a3800 in summer 1970. In 1970\u201371, he helped the \"Latics\" win the league title, scoring a total of 42 goals in all competitions, including seven hat-tricks. This tally included the opening goal in a 2\u20131 FA Cup second round victory over Peterborough United at Springfield Park. The win earned them a third round tie with Manchester City at Maine Road, which they lost 1\u20130. In a later interview he said that \"it was a delight to be supported by the wing play of Derek Temple and Graham Oates, their service was superb. They had the Beckham like ability to pick me out. I also had through balls provided from midfield by Gordon Milne and Jim Fleming, was it any wonder I scored 42 goals that season?\" He spent two seasons with Wigan, finishing as the club's top scorer on both occasions, scoring 28 goals in the 1971\u201372 campaign despite suffering with injuries.
