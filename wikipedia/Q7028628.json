In 1976, he signed with Millwall. In 1978, he played eight games with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League. However, the Rowdies had two good goalkeepers in Winston DuBose and Paul Hammond. Consequently, Johns saw time in only eight games before being sent on loan to Sheffield United where he played one game. The Rowdies then sent him on loan to Charlton Athletic. In February 1979, the Rowdies traded Johns to Charlton in exchange for Mike Flanagan who had recently been ejected from a Charlton game for fighting with his teammate Derek Hales. Johns experienced his greatest success at Charlton. Over ten seasons, he played 288 games and was named the 1981, 1983 and 1984 Charlton Player of the Year. He later played for Queens Park Rangers before finishing his career with Maidstone United.\nIn 2003, he became an assistant manager with Erith Town in the Kent League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.", "response": ["|1981|| Nicky Johns", "|1983|| Nicky Johns", "|1984|| Nicky Johns"]}, {"page": "List of Charlton Athletic F.C. players", "response": ["|Nicky Johns||||GK||1978\u201388||322||"]}, {"page": "South London derby", "response": ["* Nicky Johns"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Charlton Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["Chairman Mark Hulyer had to reach an agreement with the Inland Revenue in the summer over a \u00a3145,000 tax bill, and also faced both a petition for bankruptcy from former chairman Michael Gliksten and a winding-up order from creditors Leeds.
