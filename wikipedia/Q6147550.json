His first goal of the 2008\u201309 campaign came in the home win against Kidderminster Harriers on 7 September 2008, receiving a pass from Jamie Taylor on the right-wing to make the score 3\u20131. Cogan scored in the 47th minute of Grays' 1\u20131 draw against Woking on 18 October. In October 2008, Grays Athletic announced that players had been asked to take a 50% pay cut due to financial difficulties. During the FA Cup Fourth Round Qualifying tie against AFC Totton, Cogan scored a penalty in the 85th minute after Phil Warner handled a cross from Ishmael Welsh. His next goal came almost two months later when he netted both goals in Grays' 2\u20131 victory over Barrow at the New Recreation Ground on 20 December. His first goal of the game came after Barrow's goalkeeper, Alan Martin, spilled a cross from Ishmael Welsh which Cogan pounced on from barely a yard out. In the 56th minute, Cogan had a shot from the edge of the penalty area after out muscling defenders Steve McNulty and Paul Jones. In Grays' next match against Canvey Island in the Essex Senior Cup on 23 December, Cogan scored a late penalty in the 90th minute to equalise the game 2\u20132 and send the game into extra time.  Grays Athletic eventually lost 3\u20132 after extra time. The club released news that the players were again being paid in full and over the \"Christmas period and for January\". On 14 February 2009, Grays travelled to face Wrexham at the Racecourse Ground. He scored to equalise the game at 1\u20131 after the Wrexham goalkeeper struggled with George Beavan's initial shot whilst Cogan scored the rebound. He then set up Grays' second, crossing the ball to Andy Pugh, who scored a consolation goal as Grays lost 3\u20132. He then scored in Grays' 2\u20131 home victory over Altrincham on 7 March. Cogan finished the season as Grays' top goal scorer in all competitions."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Isthmian League", "response": ["| Jamie Taylor"]}, {"page": "Jim Taylor", "response": ["* Jamie Taylor (born 1982), footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Eastbourne Borough F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Jamie Taylor", "|Jamie Taylor scored 10 league goals.", "|align=left|Jamie Taylor", "|Jamie Taylor scored 15 league goals.", "|align=left|Jamie Taylor"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Taylor", "response": ["* Jamie Taylor, a character  from The Haunting of Bly Manor"]}]}}
