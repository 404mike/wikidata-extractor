However, hours later, confusion arose when Sinnott denied resigning. Five days later he was named the new Port Vale manager, ending the speculation about his future. Prominent backroom staff member Dean Glover had hoped to gain the management spot himself, and so pondered resigning from the club, but eventually chose to remain as Sinnott's assistant. The only significant staff member Sinnott was allowed to bring in was scout Steve Joesbury. In his first league game in charge Vale lost to local rivals Crewe Alexandra. Sinnott achieved his first win in charge of the club at Morecambe in the FA Cup First Round, with Port Vale winning 2\u20130. However the Second Round held embarrassment for both Sinnott and the club, as Southern League side Chasetown (an eighth tier team 101 league places below the Vale) picked up a 1\u20131 draw at Vale Park, before making a giant-killing with a late goal on their home ground, after Luke Rodgers missed two penalties. Sinnott warned of big changes at the club. He signed Chasetown duo Chris Slater and Kyle Perry, and heavily exploited the loan market. He ultimately proved unable to save the club from relegation, and they were relegated on 12 April 2008. With only 38 points from 46 games, they finished ahead of bottom-placed Luton Town only thanks to a ten-point deduction inflicted upon Luton. In the summer ten players left or were offloaded by Sinnott, as he attempted to make room for new signings."]}, {"page": "Dean Glover", "response": ["By February 2009, with the club in the bottom depths of the bottom tier of the Football League, fans organized protests at Glover's leadership. Many chanted 'Glover Out' during home defeats, and even a large banner was unveiled on 28 February 3\u20131 defeat to Luton Town, with organized protests involving hundreds of supporters being held before and after the game. Glover accepted he was not the popular choice to take over from Sinnott and described himself as a \"dead man walking\". Many fans, we well as local journalists and pundits questioned Glover's tactical decisions, team selection and managerial abilities in general. Some fans even started booing his son in an attempt to 'get to' Glover himself. Glover attempted to arrest his team's slide down the table by signing Carlisle United striker Kevin Gall on loan. He failed to score in seven games with the club, and returned to Carlisle after picking up a calf injury. In March, Kyle Perry was allowed to join local non-league side Northwich Victoria, after being told he had no future at Vale. In his place came loanee winger Paul Marshall from Manchester City. On 23 March, Anyon broke his leg at Saltergate in a defeat to Chesterfield."]}, {"page": "Danny Glover (footballer)", "response": ["He stated his aim to win a new contract at the end of the 2009\u201310 season. However, he was transfer listed by new manager Micky Adams in August 2009, along with five other youngsters, having failed to impress in the pre-season. He swiftly joined Conference National side Salisbury City on a one-month loan deal, along with fellow \"Valiant\" Luke Prosser. He made his debut for the \"Whites\" as a substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at the Raymond McEnhill Stadium, former Vale teammate Kyle Perry was the goalscorer. He played seven games, mostly as a substitute, before returning to Vale Park. By mid-November, his impressive performances in the reserves showed a new 'appetite for the game', and earned him a place on the first-team bench. Before the month was out he was loaned out Rochdale, also of League Two. He returned to the Vale in early January, having played just two games as a late substitute, totalling just 25 minutes on the field. His opportunities at Spotland were limited by an in-form strike force and match postponements due to poor weather. Rochdale did not extend the loan spell, reportedly due to financial difficulties. However Glover said that the loan spell helped to boost his confidence. He still received abuse from some at Vale Park though, almost a year after his father's departure. In March 2010 he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract at the Vale at the end of the season, along with fellow youth graduates Luke Prosser and Ross Davidson. He and Davidson immediately joined local Conference North side Stafford Rangers on loan."]}, {"page": "Chris Slater", "response": ["He was signed by Lee Sinnott's Port Vale, along with Chasetown teammate Kyle Perry, in January 2008 for a nominal fee and gave up his day job as a block paver.

He played four further league games that season, all of them defeats as the Vale were relegated into League Two.

Perry was then sent-off for violent conduct just before half-time; stamping on Stevenage striker Lee Boylan ultimately resulting in the latter having to be substituted.

Adam Eckersley then returned to the club after his release from Manchester United, as Sinnott's first non-loan signing. Sinnott then signed Dave Mulligan from Scunthorpe United on a short-term contract. Midfielder David Howland also arrived on loan from Birmingham City, and would join the club permanently at the end of the season. Fellow Birmingham player Krystian Pearce also signed on loan, though would impress enough to win a longer stay with Birmingham. Sinnott then raided another Birmingham club, this time Aston Villa, to bring Australian teenager Chris Herd on a one-month loan, as well as Swedish youngster Tobias Mikaelsson. He also allowed Rocastle to join Gillingham on a two-week loan. Sinnott also completed the signings of Chasetown pair Chris Slater and Kyle Perry, who left their jobs to become full-time professional footballers. In February, O'Loughlin was loaned out to Hinckley United. After the club lost a 2\u20130 lead at Victoria Park to lose 3\u20132 against Hartlepool United, club legend Jon McCarthy questioned the team's mental strength. In April, Craig Rocastle's contract was terminated by mutual consent, and he moved to play for Greek club Thrasyvoulos.

Dean Glover, unpopular with the fans, was also informed that he would not be retained as manager for the following season, and left the club permanently after he rejected the opportunity to remain as a youth coach. A slow uptake of season ticket sales was one major factor in Glover's sacking. Following Glover's departure the club withdrew their contract offer to Paul Edwards, who went on to play for Barrow.
