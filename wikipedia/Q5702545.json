Beloff, returned to fight the motion: \"Those of us who voted for the original motion have perhaps a duty to make atonement and warn against the kind of foolish arrogance to make statements that were factually and morally untrue.\" He then went on to explain himself, stating that many of the proponents of the original motion would go on to fight and die during World War II, and simply presenting the motion implied that the people of Great Britain was unable to fight in another war. Helen John spoke in favor of the motion, citing the American bases already on British soil, and American actions in Latin America being no different from the Soviets' involvement in Poland and Afghanistan. The outcome of the vote was a landslide for the opposition, with 416 noes to the 187 ayes."]}, {"page": "Anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*Helen John"]}, {"page": "HM Prison Askham Grange", "response": ["* Helen John, a peace campaigner, was held at Askham Grange for criminal damage whilst standing against Tony Blair in the UK 2001 general election in his Sedgefield constituency"]}, {"page": "List of peace activists", "response": ["* Helen John (1937\u20132017) \u2013 British activist, one of the first full-time members of the Greenham Common peace camp"]}, {"page": "2017 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Helen John, 80, anti-war activist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2017", "response": ["*Helen John, 80, British anti-war activist.Peace campaigner Helen John who fought for Sedgefield constituency against Tony Blair behind bars dies"]}, {"page": "Women's liberation movement in Europe", "response": ["The Greenham Common Peace Camp started in 1981.
