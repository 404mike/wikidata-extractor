He was a veteran of three space shuttle missions.\nSellers attended Cranbrook School, Cranbrook, Kent, United Kingdom, until 1973, and achieved a bachelor's degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh in 1976. In 1981 he gained a doctorate in biometeorology from the University of Leeds. In 2011, Sellers retired from the NASA Astronaut Corps.Before joining the astronaut corps, Sellers worked at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on research into how the Earth's biosphere and atmosphere interact.  This work involved climate system computer modelling and field work utilising aircraft, satellites and ground support input.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2016", "response": ["** Piers Sellers, British-American astronaut and meteorologist (b. 1955)"]}, {"page": "Seaford, East Sussex", "response": ["* The astronaut Piers Sellers attended Tyttenhanger Lodge Preparatory School, Seaford."]}, {"page": "Crowborough", "response": ["* Piers Sellers (1955\u20132016), NASA astronaut"]}, {"page": "The Sky at Night", "response": ["Many well-known astronauts have also appeared on the programme, such as Piers Sellers, Eugene Cernan, Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong."]}, {"page": "University of Leeds", "response": ["Notable alumni include current Leader of the Labour Party Keir Starmer, former Secretary of State Jack Straw, former co-chairman of the Conservative Party Sayeeda Warsi, Piers Sellers (NASA astronaut) and six Nobel laureates.", "Former students in the field of science and technology include NASA astronaut Piers Sellers, Nobel Prize winner and President of the Royal Society George Porter, researcher into breast cancer and the development of cancer drug Tamoxifen V.
