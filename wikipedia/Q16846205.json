CIA counter-intelligence chief James Jesus Angleton believed that a mole had penetrated the organization at the highest levels. The agency poured millions of dollars into studies examining ways to influence and control the mind and to enhance its ability to extract information from resistant subjects during interrogation. Some historians assert that one goal of MKUltra and related CIA projects was to create a \"Manchurian Candidate\"-style subject. American historian Alfred W. McCoy has claimed that the CIA attempted to focus media attention on these sorts of \"ridiculous\" programs so that the public would not look at the research's primary goal, which was effective methods of interrogation."]}, {"page": "The Independent", "response": ["* Rupert Cornwell\u2014\"Out of America\""]}, {"page": "John le Carr\u00e9", "response": ["David John Moore Cornwell was born on 19 October 1931 in Poole, Dorset, England.
