Most modern scholars believe that the ancestors attributed to Harald Hardrada's father, along with other parts of the Fairhair genealogy, are inventions reflecting the political and social expectations of the time of the authors (around two centuries after Harald Hardrada's lifetime) rather than historical reality.See, for example, Joan Turville-Petre, \"The Genealogist and History: Ari to Snorri\", Saga-Book 20 (1978\u201381), pp. 7\u201323 (pdf), Claus Krag, Ynglingatal og Ynglingasaga: en studie i historiske kilder, Oslo: Universitetsforlaget 1991, OCLC 256562288 , and Knut Helle, Cambridge History of Scandinavia, Volume I, Prehistory to 1520, Cambridge University Press, 2003, , pp. 185, 191. Harald Hardrada's alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada's own time, which seems odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne."]}, {"page": "Sigurd Syr", "response": ["The traditional view of Sigurd Halvdansson Syr's pedigree, as presented in various Icelandic poems and historical sagas culminating in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla, is that he was a great-grandson of King Harald Fairhair, through Harald's son Sigurd Rise. Doubt has been cast on his connection with Sigurd Rise, a relatively obscure son of Harald Fairhair by a Sami girl named Sn\u00e6frithr Sv\u00e1sadottir.Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla: History of the Kings of Norway, tr. Lee M. Hollander, The American-Scandinavian Foundation, Austin: University of Texas Press, 1964, repr. 1992, , Saga of \u00d3l\u00e1f Tryggvason ch. 60, p. 200. Sigurd Syr's father Halfdan may not have been King Harald's grandson Halfdan of Hadafylke.M. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, \"Scandinavian medieval descendants of Charlemagne: A detailed genealogy of the issue of Agnes Haakonsdottir, of the so-called Fairhair dynasty\", Foundations - Journal of the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy vol 2 (2007:4, July), pp. 253-76: \"It is very likely that the lord Halvdan, father of kinglet Sigurd Syr, was not identical with a possible Halvdan in Hadafylke, grandson of king Harald\". There are no contemporary attestations of such a Halfdan.Knut Helle, Cambridge History of Scandinavia, Volume I, Prehistory to 1520, Cambridge University Press, 2003, , p. 191. It is not very likely that this lineage represent historical realities. Many modern historians regard the Fairhair genealogy as in large part invented.See Joan Turville-Petre, \"The Genealogist and History: Ari to Snorri\", Saga-Book 20 (1978-81), pp. 7-23 (pdf), especially p. 15: \"[Harald Fairhair's] successors \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason, \u00d3l\u00e1fr helgi and the Norwegian kings descended from Haraldr har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i [e]ach . . . represented a separate line, which had to be connected to Haraldr: as he was their political forerunner, so also he must be their common ancestor\"."]}, {"page": "Fairhair dynasty", "response": ["Scholars now consider the Fairhair dynasty at least partly the product of medieval invention.Helle, p. 185.Birgit and Peter Sawyer, Medieval Scandinavia: from Conversion to Reformation, circa 800-1500, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993, , p. 61. One motive would be to increase the legitimacy of rulers by giving them a clear royal ancestry dating back to the foundation of the kingdom. Another was to provide pedigrees for other people by connecting them to the royal house. Versions of the royal descent are preserved in various works by Icelandic skalds and historians, some based on now lost works: \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir's Ynglingatal, in N\u00f3regs konungatal (which preserves information from a lost work by S\u00e6mundr fr\u00f3\u00f0i), and at greatest length in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla (which preserves information from a now lost version of Ari \u00deorgilsson's \u00cdslendingab\u00f3k). These differ in some respects. Joan Turville-Petre explored the relationship between them and argued that the original aims were to establish a framework of regnal years for dating and to connect Icelandic chieftains to them,Joan Turville-Petre, \"The Genealogist and History: Ari to Snorri\", Saga-Book 20 (1978-81), pp. 7-23 (pdf), especially pp. 8, 10: \"The numbers suggest that this was a professional genealogical document, made up in sets of ten generations\". and that the Vestfold origin of the dynasty was deliberately altered and they were connected to the Swedish Ynglings rather than the Skj\u01ebldungs to fit Icelandic tradition.Turville-Petre, pp. 14: \"According to Ynglingatal, the first five members were all buried in Vestfold; which implies that this was the centre of their power. Yet Ari entitles the first member Upplendingakonungr. In Icelandic historical tradition the emphasis is on the mountain regions\"; 15: \"The Skj\u01ebldungs were not in question . . . ; the Ynglings of Sweden were chosen\". Claus Krag argued that an important motive was to establish a hereditary claim to Viken, the region around Oslo, because the area had been paying taxes to the King of Denmark.Claus Krag, Ynglingatal og Ynglingasaga: en studie i historiske kilder, Oslo: Universitetsforlaget 1991, OCLC 256562288, pp. 231, 243 "]}, {"page": "J.
