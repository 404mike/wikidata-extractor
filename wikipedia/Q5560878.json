The last five minutes were assigned to the Weather Forecast  every day of the week, with the biggest listening figures being at weekends when parents joined in too. It was the time of day during the week when children could be expected to be home from school, and was aimed at an audience aged about 5 to 15 years.  Programming was imbued with Reithian virtues, and Children's Hour was often criticised, like \"Auntie\" BBC itself, for paternalism and middle-class values. It was nonetheless hugely popular, and its presenters were national figures, their voices instantly recognisable.  Derek McCulloch was closely involved with the programme from 1926, and ran the department from 1933 until 1950, when he had to resign for health reasons. From 1928 to 1960, Children's Hour in Scotland was organised and presented by Kathleen Garscadden, known as Auntie Kathleen, whose popularity brought crowds to the radio station in Glasgow.W. H. McDowell, \u2018Garscadden, Kathleen Mary Evelyn (1897\u20131991)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009  Popular nature study programmes on Children's Hour were presented by George Bramwell Evens ('Romany of the BBC'), Norman Ellison ('Nomad of the BBC') and David Seth-Smith (the 'Zoo Man of the BBC') in England and Wales during the 1930s, 40s and 50s.  On Scottish Children's Hour their equivalents were Gilbert Dempster Fisher (the 'Hut Man of the BBC'), James Douglas-Home (the 'Bird Man'), and Thomas Haining Gillespie (known later as the 'Zoo Man of the Scottish BBC')."]}, {"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Gilbert Dempster Fisher (1906\u20131985), Scottish naturalist, writer and broadcaster"]}]}}
