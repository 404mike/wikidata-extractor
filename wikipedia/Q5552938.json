He stood as a local Conservative candidate for the newly created council of Milton Keynes and became one of the new city's first councillors.\nHe left local politics shortly before the election of 1979 and stood as Conservative candidate for the Parliamentary seat of North Cornwall, which he gained, defeating the Liberal Party incumbent John Pardoe.  Knighted in 1990 as part of Margaret Thatcher's Resignation Honours, he held the seat until 1992, when he himself lost to the Liberal Democrat Paul Tyler. Neale returned to his former career as a solicitor, but was struck off the roll of solicitors by the Law Society of England and Wales in 2002 after admitting allegations of involvement in fraudulent banking transactions.In retirement he lived in Ealing, and wrote a novel: Squaring Circles (2011, Pearl Press: ISBN 978-0-9568688-2-4).  He also wrote songs. He died of cancer on 28 October 2015 at the age of 74.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gerry Neale"]}, {"page": "1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Gerry Neale"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gerry Neale"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Gerry Neale"]}, {"page": "Paul Tyler", "response": ["After an 18-year absence, he returned to Parliament at the 1992 general election, when he was elected as Liberal Democrat Member for North Cornwall, defeating the Conservative incumbent Gerry Neale, who had defeated John Pardoe in 1979.
