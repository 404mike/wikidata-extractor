He made his first-class debut for the North against the South in 1856 at Broughton Cricket Club Ground.  The North batted first, making 219 all out, with Perry ending the innings unbeaten on 11.  The South then reached 46/3 in their first-innings, at which point poor weather intervened and the match ended as a draw.  He continued to play for Liverpool Cricket Club as an effective bowler over the next decade, before being selected to play in Lancashire's inaugural first-class match against Middlesex at Old Trafford in 1865.  Winning the toss and electing to bat first, Lancashire made 243 all out, with Perry being dismissed for 16 by William Catling.  In response, Middlesex made the same total in their first-innings, during which Perry took two catches and made a single stumping while keeping-wicket, as well as bowling seven overs.  In its second-innings, Lancashire were dismissed for 178 all out, with Perry dismissed for a duck by Vyell Walker.  Chasing 199 for victory, Middlesex were dismissed for 116, with Perry taking a single catch during their chase."]}, {"page": "Catling, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Catling"]}]}}
