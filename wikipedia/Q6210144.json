He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series and was an original member of William Clarke's All-England Eleven.  He also played for Hampshire.\nGuy was a great stylist as a batsman and Clarke said of him: \"Elegance, all elegance, fit to play before the Queen in her parlour.\"Guy scored 3395 runs in his first-class career at 13.41 with a top score of 98 from eight half-centuries.

Clarke's team was indeed a top-class side worthy of its title as, in 1846, it consisted of himself, Joe Guy (cricketer), George Parr (all of Nottinghamshire), William Lillywhite, Jemmy Dean (both Sussex), William Denison, Will Martingell (both Surrey), Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Wanostrocht (aka \"Felix\") and William Hillyer (all Kent). Their matches in Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds were a huge success and very profitable, especially for Clarke himself who was careful to pay his players more than Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) did (from \u00a34 to \u00a36 per week) and so keep them interested. He kept the surplus for himself."]}, {"page": "North v South", "response": ["* 1 \u2013 Arthur Rich, Daniel Hayward, Edward Grimston, Frederick Ponsonby, Henry Hall, John Bayley, John Gibson, Joe Guy, John Wenman, Thomas Heath, William Clarke, William Dorrinton, William Ward, Will Caldecourt"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Joe Guy"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Joe Guy"]}, {"page": "List of Nottingham Cricket Club players", "response": ["|Joe Guy"]}, {"page": "Joe Guy", "response": ["Joe Guy may refer to:", "*Joe Guy (cricketer) (1813\u20131873), English cricketer", "*Joe Guy (musician) (1920\u20131962), American jazz trumpeter"]}]}}
