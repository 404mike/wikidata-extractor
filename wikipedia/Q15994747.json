In 1913 the foundations of the fort, which had been conjectured as being in the vicinity, were confirmed. In 1923, during redevelopment of the area, significant archaeology was undertaken which established the size and nature of the Roman Fort. The fort, built around 81 AD, occupied an area of about four acres and was enclosed by an outer defensive wall. If the date is correct, it shows that the fort preceded the Antonine Wall by some sixty years. Internally, buildings discovered included a praetorium (headquarters), barracks and a granary.Miller, S.N. (1924) The Roman Fort at Old Kilpatrick, Glasgow Archaeological Society. A video reconstruction of the site has been produced. Sir George Macdonald also wrote about the excavations. Major development precluded further significant excavation, and nothing is visible of the remains today; the remains lie beneath the houses of Gavinburn Gardens to the east, a large commercial building to the west and the A814 road to the north. Finds from Old Kilpatrick include several distance slabs. One distance slab by the Twentieth Legion is known to have been completed before 1684. It depicts Victory with a palm-branch in one hand and a garland in the other. It was found at Ferrydyke on the Clyde's northern bank and records the completion of 4411 feet; the last 3 Roman numerals are the same as the remaining ones on the other damaged distance slab (RIB 2206)."]}, {"page": "Cadder", "response": ["In antiquity, Cadder was the site of a Roman fort on the route of the Antonine Wall. Its neighbouring forts are Balmuildy to the west and Kirkintilloch to the east although there are intermediate fortlets at Wilderness Plantation to the west and Glasgow Bridge to the east. The Second Legion may have been responsible for building the fort. John Clarke of the Glasgow Archaeological Society excavated the remains in the 1930s. Sir George Macdonald also wrote about the excavation of the site. The site was destroyed by sand quarrying in the 1940s. A sketch of the medieval motte made by Skinner still survives. One find at Cadder was an oil lamp which is associated with the bath house of the fort. Before the Reformation the lands of Cadder and the kirk belonged to the Bishops of Glasgow. In the 18th century James Dunlop of Garnkirk being a wealthy landowner opposed Thomas Muir and the congregation at Cadder over who appointed their minister. Cadder Parish Church was described in the 19th century as a neat modern Gothic church.

Its neighbouring forts were Croy Hill to the west and Castlecary to the east. At Tollpark, is one of the best preserved continuous sections of the whole Wall, between the forts of Castlecary and Westerwood. There may have been a signal tower at Garnhall from where both Westerwood and Castlecary forts are likely to have been visible. A kissing gate behind Castlecary Hotel provides access to this section of the wall to the east. Parking for the section of the wall to the west can be found at Dullatur or Croy. Many Roman forts along the wall held garrisons of around 500 men. Larger forts like Castlecary and Birrens had a nominal cohort of 1000 men but probably sheltered women and children as well although the troops were not allowed to marry. There is also likely to have been large communities of civilians around the site. Westerwood was excavated in 1932 by Sir George Macdonald who wrote about it. It was also excavated in 1974 and 1985-8. Finds near Westerwood include a distance slab depicting a sea-deity and a naked, tied, captive and an uninscribed altar which were found at Arniebog. The slab can now be viewed at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow. Other artefacts include a diamond patterned stone and a grey, buff jar. A religious stone showed a relief of an engorged phallus over the inscription EX VOTO \"the result of a vow\". It was found in 1725 but has since been lost. It had a second inscription: NVX \"the night\". Also a centurion called Verecundus, and his wife, dedicated an altar to Silvanus and the Sky which was recovered at Westerwood. Pottery found at Westerwood is unlike any other pottery found on the Antonine Wall. It has been suggested that the course pottery was made locally by a single potter at Westerwood."]}, {"page": "Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland", "response": ["*Sir George Macdonald"]}, {"page": "George MacDonald (disambiguation)", "response": ["* George Macdonald (archaeologist) (1862\u20131940), Scottish archaeologist", "* George Macdonald (historian) (1891\u20131967), New Zealand farmer and historian"]}, {"page": "Antonine Wall", "response": ["Sir George Macdonald carried out systematic work on the wall that was published in 1911 and in an expanded second edition in 1934.
