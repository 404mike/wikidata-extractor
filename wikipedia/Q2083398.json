While a student at Mansfield College, Oxford, he was discovered by Olivier Messiaen and his wife Yvonne Loriod, who heard him play and immediately invited him to come to Paris to study with them. In 1968 he was second prize winner (joint prize winner with Japanese pianist Izumi Tateno) at the Messiaen Competition in Royan, France. Crossley is particularly associated with the music of Messiaen and British composers such as Michael Tippett, Nicholas Maw and George Benjamin. Tippett wrote his third and fourth piano sonatas specifically with Crossley in mind. His extensive discography includes the piano works of Tippett, Faur\u00e9, Debussy and Ravel and the Faur\u00e9 violin sonatas with Arthur Grumiaux.\nCrossley was artistic director of the London Sinfonietta from 1988 to 1994.\nHe presented a landmark television series on avant garde classical music entitled Sinfonietta for Channel 4.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Esa-Pekka Salonen", "response": ["*Lutos\u0142awski:  Piano Concerto (Paul Crossley, piano)", "*Olivier Messiaen: Turangal\u00eela-Symphonie, Witold Lutos\u0142awski: Symphony No 3 (Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, Paul Crossley, piano, John Shirley-Quirk, baritone)", "*Olivier Messiaen: Des canyons aux \u00e9toiles, Couleurs de la cit\u00e9 c\u00e9leste, & Oiseaux exotiques (Paul Crossley, piano)", "*Igor Stravinsky: Concerto for piano & wind instruments, Capriccio for piano & orchestra, Movements for piano & orchestra, & Symphonies of wind instruments (Paul Crossley, piano)"]}, {"page": "Fanny Waterman", "response": ["Waterman's notable students include Paul Crossley, Jonathan Dunsby, Benjamin Frith, Michael Roll and Allan Schiller; Roll won the inaugural Leeds competition and her students were also successful in other international competitions.
