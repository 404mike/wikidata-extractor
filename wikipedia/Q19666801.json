Her 14-year-old boyfriend, Luke Mitchell, came under suspicion, but it was several months before he was arrested. Mitchell was tried for the murder and after Scotland's longest single-accused trial, Mitchell was convicted in January 2005 despite there being no direct evidence against him. (Subsequently, in 2011, the trial of Malcolm Webster surpassed Mitchell\u2019s case as the longest single-accused trial). Mitchell was sentenced to detention without limit of time with a minimum of 20 years.  He continues to protest his innocence and has insisted he will only walk out of prison an innocent man, and he will not accept liability in order to make himself eligible for early release or parole.", "In May 2007, a BBC Scotland Frontline Scotland documentary special on BBC One explored a theory \u2013 not followed up by police during the initial investigation \u2013 that the murder might have been committed not by Mitchell but by a student and heavy drug-user who was alleged to have handed in an essay about killing a girl in the woods a few weeks before the murder. A friend of this suspect saw him soon after the murder and claimed that he was heavily scratched about the face. The documentary also challenged the theory that Mitchell was an obsessive Marilyn Manson fan and had a keen interest in the infamous 1947 Los Angeles 'Black Dahlia' murder. In the documentary, it was stated that there is no evidence that Mitchell knew of the Dahlia case until after the murder. Also in the documentary, Professor Anthony Busuttil, when asked about the similarities between the injuries to Jodi Jones and the Black Dahlia victim Elizabeth Short, said \"there were major dissimilarities.\" The Jones family were reported in the Daily Record to be \"outraged\" at the programme, though the newspaper stated that none of them had watched it."]}, {"page": "Senrab F.C.", "response": ["* Jodi Jones"]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Jodi Jones", "|align=left| Jodi Jones", "|align=left| Jack Grimmer Jodi Jones Marc McNulty", "|align=left| Jodi Jones"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Jodi Jones"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Jodi Jones"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["|45||Jodi Jones||AM||||Bow||||0||0||Dagenham & Redbridge||18 March 2016||Loan||30 June 2016", "| 45 ||  || Jodi Jones || MF || 4+2 || || || || 6", "|  Jodi Jones ||  Dagenham & Redbridge || 18 March 2016 || End of season || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["|10||Jodi Jones||RW||||Bow||||6||0||Dagenham & Redbridge||10 May 2016||Undisclosed||30 June 2020", "| 10 ||  || Jodi Jones || MF || 11+23 || 1+1 || 0+1 || 3+5 || 45", "| 10 ||  || Jodi Jones || MF || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 2", "| 10 ||  || Jodi Jones || MF || 3 || 0 || 0 || 4 || 7", "| 10 ||  || Jodi Jones || MF || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3", "|  Jodi Jones ||  Dagenham & Redbridge || 1 July 2016 || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2017 EFL Trophy Final", "response": ["Their second group game was at home to Northampton in early August, with an attendance \u2013 2,085 \u2013 even lower than that of the West Ham game.
