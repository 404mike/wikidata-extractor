Key figures included Iain Crichton Smith, whose plays explored wide-ranging themes. Often humorous, they also dealt with serious topics such as the betrayal of Christ in An Coileach (A Cockerel, 1966) of the Highland Clearances in A' Ch\u00f9irt (The Court, 1966).I. Brown, \"Processes and interactive events: theatre and Scottish devolution\", in S. Blandford, ed., Theatre and Performance in Small Nations (Bristol: Interlect, 2013), pp. 37-8. Iain Moireach's plays also used humour to deal with serious subjects, as in Feumaidh Sinn a Bhith G\u00e0ireachdainn (We Have to Laugh, 1969), which focused on threats to the Gaelic language. Other major figures included Tormod Calum D\u00f2mhnallach (1927\u20132000), whose work included Anna Chaimbeul (Anna Campbell, 1977), which was influenced by Japanese Noh theatre. Fionnlagh MacLe\u00f2id's (Finley Macleod) work included Ceann Cropic (1967), which was strongly influenced by the theatre of the absurd. Similarly, Donaidh MacIlleathain (Donnie Maclean), made use of absurd dialogue in An Sgoil Dhubh (A Dark School, 1974). Many of these authors continued writing into the 1980s and even the 1990s, but this was something of a golden age for Gaelic drama that has not been matched.M. Mcleod and M. Watson, \"In the shadow of the bard: the Gaelic short story, novel and drama\", in I.

The first edition was published in August 2003, intending to replace the older Gairm magazine, which had closed. Gath aimed to reproduce the mainstream appeal of its predecessor, whilst attracting a younger audience with fresh topics, such as contemporary music and current events. Each issue contained a number of short stories, essays, and poems; over 500 short stories were published in the magazine. B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig provided a \u00a35000 foundational grant and ongoing support, and Gath was published biannually from 2003 until at least 2008.

Of the memoir, Ronald Black has written, \"It is a remarkable achievement consisting as it does of the memoirs of an exciting life, woven together with a forthright personal philosophy and much detailed ethnological commentary on tradition and change in island communities during the twentieth century, all steeped in a solution of anecdote, sometimes brilliantly funny. It is the twentieth century's leading work of Gaelic nonfictional prose.\""]}]}}
