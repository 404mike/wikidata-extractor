Although the missions continued, the transformation of Japan through Chinese influences declined, despite the close connections that had existed during the early Kofun period. Meanwhile, the kingdoms of the Korean peninsula, often at odds with each other, frequently sent diplomatic missions with gifts to Japan, probably with the aim of securing Japanese neutrality or diplomatic/military support in their rivalries;Early Samurai: 200\u20131500 AD by Anthony J. Bryant, Angus McBride \"At about this time Paekche began feeling renewed pressure from Silla and Koguryo and pleaded with the Yamato court to send help\u00a0... During the Mimana struggles against Silla, Paekche sent many presents to Japan.\"(Page8) ultimately, this proved to be of the greatest benefit to Baekje, as Japanese military support for that kingdom increased.Sansom, George (1958). A History of Japan to 1334. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. 47\u201349. People, many of them artisans and skilled workers, also emigrated to Japan from the Korean peninsula, including two high priests who arrived in Japan in 595: Eji from Goguryeo and Es\u014d from Baekje.Encyclopedia of World Biography on Shotoku Taishi \"Two Korean high priests arrived in Japan in 595\u2014Eji from the kingdom of Koryo (Koma) and Eso from the kingdom of Paekche (Kudara).\" Kanroku also came from Baekje, and was a tutor to Prince Sh\u014dtoku, counseling him politically. When Japan allied with Baekje, the Goguryeo priests left Japan."]}, {"page": "Hajduk", "response": ["In the mid-17th century hajduk-style infantry largely fell out of fashion in Poland-Lithuania, and were replaced by musket-armed infantry of Western style. However, commanders or hetmans of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth continued to maintain their own liveried bodyguards of hajduks, well into the 18th century as something of a throwback to the past, even though they were now rarely used as field troops. In imitation of these bodyguards, in the 18th century wealthy members of the szlachta hired liveried domestic servants whom they called hajduks, thereby creating the meaning of the term 'hajduk' as it is generally understood in modern Polish.Richard Brzezinski, Polish Armies 1569-1696, volume 1, London: Osprey Military Publishing, 1987, p.\u00a021, 39-41 (also contains six contemporary illustrations of Polish hajduks, besides several modern reconstructions by Angus McBride)."]}, {"page": "Varangian Guard", "response": ["The Varangians were described by 11th-century Byzantine historian Michael Psellus as thus: \u201cThe whole group carry shields and brandish on their shoulders a certain single-edged, heavy-iron weapon\", which is understood to have been the daneaxe (many Byzantine writers referred to them as \"axe-bearing barbarians\", pelekyphoroi barbaroi, rather than as Varangians).
