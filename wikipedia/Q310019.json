This act of kindness endeared him to many (particularly British) athletics fans."]}, {"page": "Marion Jones", "response": ["In the run-up to the 2000 Olympics, Jones declared that she intended to win gold medals in all five of her competition events at Sydney. Jones's husband, C.J. Hunter, had withdrawn from the shot-put competition for a knee injury, though he was allowed to keep his coaching credentials and attend the games to support his wife. However, just hours after Marion Jones won her first of the planned five golds, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that Hunter had failed four pre-Olympic drug tests, testing positive each time for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone. Hunter was immediately suspended from taking any role at the Sydney games, and he was ordered to surrender his on-field coaching credentials. At a press conference where Hunter broke down in tears, he denied taking any performance-enhancing drugs, much less the easily detected nandrolone (which showed up in all four tests in amounts over 1,000 times normal levels); Victor Conte of BALCO, who was regularly supplying \"nutritional supplements\" to athletes trained by Trevor Graham, blamed the test results on \"an iron supplement\" that contained nandrolone precursors and tied previous positive nandrolone tests from Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey and British sprinter Linford Christie to the same supplement. As late as 2004, Hunter was still denying the charges and attempting to gain access to the results to see if they could be analyzed further. Jones would later write in her autobiography, Marion Jones: Life in the Fast Lane, that Hunter's positive drug tests hurt their marriage and her image as a drug-free athlete. The couple divorced in 2002."]}, {"page": "Sprint (running)", "response": ["The 100 m Olympic gold and silver medallist Linford Christie of Great Britain famously had frequent false starts that were marginally below the legal reaction time of 0.1\u00a0seconds. Christie and his coach, Ron Roddan, both claimed that the false starts were due to Christie's exceptional reaction times being under the legal time. His frequent false starting eventually led to his disqualification from the 1996 Summer Olympics 100\u00a0m final in Atlanta, US due to a second false start by Christie.  Since January 2010, under WA rules, a single false start by an athlete results in disqualification.", "|John Regis, Ade Mafe, Darren Braithwaite, Linford Christie"]}, {"page": "Fulham", "response": ["* Linford Christie (born 1960), Olympian athlete ", "File:Linford Christie 2009.png|Linford Christie in 2009.
