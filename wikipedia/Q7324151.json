The monument would be paid for through donations, and as a result, fundraising efforts quickly commenced. The total cost for the monument would be approximately \u00a31,250. W. H. Clarks of Leeds was selected to design the monument as a Doric column. While Clarks was also responsible for overseeing the erection of the monument, the actual building was carried out by Myers and Wilson. On 1 August 1834, the date on which the Slavery Abolition Act went into effect, the monument's cornerstone was laid by Richard Bethell MP. While several locations in the city had been considered (including Kingston Square and several locations near the banks of the Humber), the location that had ultimately been selected was Whitefriargate, near the Princes Quay dock. A statue, initially only an afterthought of the monument committee, was also commissioned and created by Feort, a local sculptor. Construction was completed with the placement of the statue on 12 November 1835."]}, {"page": "Rise Hall", "response": ["The Hall was rebuilt by Richard Bethell between 1815\u201320.

However the Pevsner architectural guide to the Buildings of England suggests that Watson & Pritchett of York could be the architects.  The house is primarily west facing, where it is fronted by a Grecian-style portico supported by pillars.
