Lippi was impressed enough to name him in the roster for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, but Santon did not manage to make an appearance in the tournament as Italy went out in the first round. After some strong performances since signing with Newcastle United, Santon was recalled to the national team under manager Cesare Prandelli for the friendly against France in November 2012, however Santon did not come off the bench in the 2\u20131 home defeat. He started his next game for Italy, earning his eighth international cap, in a 1\u20131 friendly draw against the Netherlands in Amsterdam on 6 February 2013."]}, {"page": "Corry Evans", "response": ["Evans received his first call-up to the Northern Ireland senior team on 20 May 2009; he was named in a 19-man squad that contained nine other uncapped players for the match against Italy in Pisa on 6 June 2009.
