In February 1839, he assumed charge of the office of Commissioner for the Suppression of Thuggee and Dacoity. During these operations, more than 1400 Thugs were hanged or transported for life."]}, {"page": "Human sacrifice", "response": ["Thuggees, tuggees or thugs, were a religious cult devoted to Kali and an organized gang of professional robbers and murderers who traveled in groups across the Indian subcontinent for several hundred years. They were first mentioned in \u1e92iy\u0101'-ud-D\u012bn Baran\u012b's  () dated around 1356. In the 1830s British Governor-General of India William Bentinck, along with his chief captain William Henry Sleeman made a concerted effort to put an end to the activities of the Thuggee. The effort proved successful, with the cult's activities being fully eradicated in the span of a few decades. Thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence. This would allow them to then surprise and strangle them by tossing a handkerchief or noose around their necks. The killings were performed in honour of the goddess Kali and were very ritualistic. They would then rob the bodies of valuables and bury them. This led them to also be called Phansigar (), a term more commonly used in southern India."]}, {"page": "Taj Mahal", "response": ["Another such unsupported theory is that the Taj Mahal was designed by an Italian, Geronimo Vereneo, held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by Henry George Keene in 1879 who went by a translation of a Spanish work Itinerario, (The Travels of Fray Sebastian Manrique, 1629\u20131643). Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies."]}, {"page": "Lord William Bentinck", "response": ["Lieutenant General Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck  (14 September 177417 June 1839), known as Lord William Bentinck, was a British soldier and statesman. He served as Governor-General of India from 1828 to 1835. He has been credited for significant social and educational reforms in India, including abolishing sati, suppressing female infanticide and human sacrifice. Bentinck said that \"the dreadful responsibility hanging over his head in this world and the next, if\u2026 he was to consent to the continuance of this practice (sati) one moment longer.\" Bentinck after consultation with the army and officials passed the Bengal Sati Regulation, 1829 there was little opposition. The only challenge came from the Dharma Sabha which appealed in the Privy Council, however the ban on Sati was upheld. He ended lawlessness by eliminating thuggee \u2013 which had existed for over 450 years \u2013 with the aid of his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman. Along with Thomas Babington Macaulay he introduced English as the language of instruction in India."]}, {"page": "Titanosaurus", "response": ["The holotype vertebrae were discovered during an exploration to Jabalpur in 1828 by Capt William Henry Sleeman of the East India Company army. His was one among many explorations for fossils initially carried out by army personnel, medical doctors and priests who chanced upon them just by being \u201cfairly literate and mobile at the time\u201d. He stumbled across the vertebrae on Bara Simla Hill near a British Army gun carriage workshop while searching for petrified wood. Sleeman, employed by the Bengal Army, regarded the bones as curiosities. He gave two vertebral pieces to surgeon G. G. Spilsbury, who had a practice in Japalpur and who also excavated a bone himself. Spilsbury sent the fossils in 1832 to the antiquarian James Prinsep in Calcutta, who realised that they were fossilised bones and then sent them back to Sleeman.Sleeman, W. H, 1844. Rambles and recollections of Indian official, Vol. I , London, J. Hatchard & Son, 478 pp. In 1862, Thomas Oldman, the first director of the newly established Geological Survey of India, transferred the vertebrae from Japalpur to Calcutta and added them to the collection of the Indian Museum. There, the bones were studied by the Survey's supervisor, Hugh Falconer, who concluded that they were reptilian bones.Falconer, H., (1868). \"Notes on fossil remains found in the Valley of the Indus below Attock, and at Jubbulpoor\". 414\u2013419 in: Murchison, C.

The authorities thought that limiting the movement of these groups would minimise this as well as allowing for better monitoring of their activities and encouraging them to switch from criminality to agricultural pursuits. Inspired by the reported successes of William Henry Sleeman in controlling the Thuggees of the North-Western Provinces, they initially attempted to restrict movement by imposing a system of compulsory registration at police stations, insisting on the targeted people being in their own village overnight unless they had permission for absence, and loading of responsibility for their location and actions on to the village headmen. These measures were easily evaded by many nomads, who just dispersed or proffered different identities."]}, {"page": "Oudh State", "response": ["| Sir William Henry Sleeman || 1849 || 1854 "]}, {"page": "1839 in India", "response": ["*Major-General William Henry Sleeman heads the Thuggee and Dacoity Department from February 1839"]}, {"page": "Sleeman (surname)", "response": ["* William Henry Sleeman (1788\u20131856), British colonial administrator"]}, {"page": "Sataon", "response": ["Along with Korihar, Sataon historically gave its name to a large taluqdari estate called Korihar Sataon, which was held by a branch of the Bais Rajputs.
