About 885 he was asked by Alfred the Great to leave St David's and join the circle of learned men whom Alfred was recruiting for his court. After spending a year at Caerwent because of illness, Asser accepted.\nIn 893, Asser wrote a biography of Alfred, called the Life of King Alfred. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, which was part of the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and possibly with other works.\nAsser is sometimes cited as a source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire Life is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred the Great", "response": ["After ascending the throne, Alfred spent several years fighting Viking invasions. He won a decisive victory in the Battle of Edington in 878 and made an agreement with the Vikings, creating what was known as the Danelaw in the North of England. Alfred also oversaw the conversion of Viking leader Guthrum to Christianity. He defended his kingdom against the Viking attempt at conquest, becoming the dominant ruler in England. Details of his life are described in a work by 9th-century Welsh scholar and bishop Asser.", "Alfred was a son of \u00c6thelwulf, king of Wessex, and his wife Osburh. According to his biographer, Asser, writing in 893, \"In the year of our Lord's Incarnation 849 Alfred, King of the Anglo-Saxons\", was born at the royal estate called Wantage, in the district known as Berkshire (which is so called from Berroc Wood, where the box tree grows very abundantly).\" This date has been accepted by the editors of Asser's biography, Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, and by other historians such as David Dumville and Richard Huscroft. However, West Saxon genealogical lists state that Alfred was 23 when he became king in April 871, implying that he was born between April 847 and April 848. This dating is adopted in the biography of Alfred by Alfred Smyth, who regards Asser's biography as fraudulent, an allegation which is rejected by other historians. Richard Abels in his biography discusses both sources but does not decide between them and dates Alfred's birth as 847/849, while Patrick Wormald in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article dates it 848/849. Berkshire had been historically disputed between Wessex and Mercia, and as late as 844, a charter showed that it was part of Mercia, but Alfred's birth in the county is evidence that, by the late 840s, control had passed to Wessex.", "He was the youngest of six children. His eldest brother, \u00c6thelstan, was old enough to be appointed sub-king of Kent in 839, almost 10 years before Alfred was born. He died in the early 850s. Alfred's next three brothers were successively kings of Wessex. \u00c6thelbald (858-860) and \u00c6thelberht (860-865) were also much older than Alfred, but \u00c6thelred (865-871) was only a year or two older. Alfred's only known sister, \u00c6thelswith, married Burgred, king of the midland kingdom of Mercia in 853. Most historians think that Osburh was the mother of all \u00c6thelwulf's children, but some suggest that the older ones were born to an unrecorded first wife. Osburh was descended from the rulers of the Isle of Wight. She was described by Alfred's biographer Asser as \"a most religious woman, noble by temperament and noble by birth\". She had died by 856 when \u00c6thelwulf married Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, king of West Francia.", "According to Asser, in his childhood Alfred won a beautifully decorated book of English poetry, offered as a prize by his mother to the first of her sons able to memorise it. He must have had it read to him because his mother died when he was about six and he did not learn to read until he was 12. In 853, Alfred is reported by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to have been sent to Rome where he was confirmed by Pope Leo IV, who \"anointed him as king\". Victorian writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory coronation in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time because Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a \"consul\" and a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion. It may be based upon the fact that Alfred later accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of Charles the Bald, king of the Franks, around 854\u2013855. On their return from Rome in 856, \u00c6thelwulf was deposed by his son \u00c6thelbald. With civil war looming, the magnates of the realm met in council to form a compromise. \u00c6thelbald retained the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and \u00c6thelwulf ruled in the east. After King \u00c6thelwulf died in 858, Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: \u00c6thelbald, \u00c6thelberht and \u00c6thelred.", "Alfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes the Great Heathen Army of Danes landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms which constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865. Alfred's public life began in 865 at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18-year-old \u00c6thelred. During this period, Bishop Asser gave Alfred the unique title of secundarius, which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic tanist, a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the Witan to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should \u00c6thelred fall in battle. It was a well known tradition among other Germanic peoples - such as the Swedes and Franks to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related - to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander.", "While he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot and then again in his presence at Wilton in May. The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. Alfred was forced instead to make peace with them. Although the terms of the peace are not recorded, Bishop Asser wrote that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.", "The Viking army withdrew from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser or by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Alfred probably paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year. Hoards dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/872 have been excavated at Croydon, Gravesend and Waterloo Bridge. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years, the Danes occupied other parts of England.", "According to Asser,", "After the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace, the king was forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in Kent, an allied kingdom in South East England, during the year 885, which was possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of Rochester, where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion, Alfred led an Anglo-Saxon force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.", "Not long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, but Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder. After travelling up the River Stour, the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number), and a battle ensued. The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious, and as Huntingdon accounts, \"laden with spoils\". The victorious fleet was surprised when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.", "The burhs were connected by a road system maintained for army use (known as herepaths). The roads allowed an army quickly to be assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader. The road network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for them. The Vikings lacked the equipment for a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of siegecraft, having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission but this gave the king time to send his field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the army roads. In such cases, the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces. Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892 and stormed a half-built, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in Kent, the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia. Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the demands placed upon them even though they were for \"the common needs of the kingdom\".Asser, translated by ", "Alfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896 he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the English Navy. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. Alfred's older brother sub-king \u00c6thelstan of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships and Alfred had conducted naval actions in 882. The year 897 marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred used the design of Greek and Roman warships, with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation. Cf. the much more positive view of the capabilities of these ships in ", "Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and \"would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust\".Asser chap. 106, in  A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.The charter is Sawyer 1445 and is printed in .", "Asser represents Alfred as a Solomonic judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves \"to the pursuit of wisdom\". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.Asser, chap. 106, in .", "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England, whereas Asser's The Life of King Alfred promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales because Alfred had acquired overlordship of that country.", "Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available. His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of Orosius. He corresponded with Elias III, the patriarch of Jerusalem, and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the pope were fairly frequent. Around 890, Wulfstan of Hedeby undertook a journey from Hedeby on Jutland along the Baltic Sea to the Prussian trading town of Truso. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.", "Alfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of Great Britain are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the southern Welsh princes, owing to the pressure on them from North Wales and Mercia, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign, the North Welsh followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of three pilgrim \"Scots\" (i.e., Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that, in his childhood, he was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint Modwenna may show Alfred's interest in that island.", "Very little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century. According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney because there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.", "Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and \"a good many of lesser birth\". There they studied books in both English and Latin and \"devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts\". He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. Grimbald and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop W\u00e6rferth of Worcester, \u00c6thelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.", "The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or propaganda. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings including Offa, clerical writers including Bede, and Alcuin and various participants in the Carolingian renaissance. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.", "Asser wrote of Alfred in his Life of King Alfred,", "It is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was 12 years old or later, which is described as \"shameful negligence\" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; \"I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest.\" After excitedly asking, \"Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?\" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.", "Alfred is noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, that contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these \"he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it.\" An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody's skills could compare.", "Although he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred \"could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time\".", "They had five or six children together, including Edward the Elder who succeeded his father as king; \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d who became lady of the Mercians; and \u00c6lfthryth who married Baldwin II, Count of Flanders. His mother was Osburga, daughter of Oslac of the Isle of Wight, Chief Butler of England. Asser, in his Vita \u00c6lfredi asserts that this shows his lineage from the Jutes of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely because Bede tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under C\u00e6dwalla.", "Alfred died on 26 October 899 at the age of 50 or 51. How he died is unknown, but he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness. His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms, and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either Crohn's disease or haemorrhoids. His grandson King Eadred seems to have suffered from a similar illness.", "Alfred commissioned Bishop Asser to write his biography, which inevitably emphasised Alfred's positive aspects. Later medieval historians such as Geoffrey of Monmouth also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the Reformation, Alfred was seen as a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the 16th century who gave Alfred his epithet as \"the Great\", not any of Alfred's contemporaries. The epithet was retained by succeeding generations who admired Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education, and establishment of the rule of law."]}, {"page": "Jutes", "response": ["The chroniclers, Procopius, Constantius of Lyon, Gildas, Bede, Nennius, and also the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Alfred the Great and Asser provide the names of tribes who settled Britain during the mid-fifth century, and in their combined testimony, the four tribes mentioned are the Angli, Saxones, Iutae and Frisii.", "* Asser in his Life of Alfred (Chapter 2) identifies the Jutes with the Goths (in a passage claiming that Alfred the Great was descended, through his mother, Osburga, from the ruling dynasty of the Jutish kingdom of Wihtwara, on the Isle of Wight)."]}, {"page": "Vikings", "response": ["The etymology of \"Viking\" is uncertain.

Over the following years, what became known as the Great Heathen Army overwhelmed the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia. Then in 871, the Great Summer Army arrived from Scandinavia, to reinforce the Great Heathen Army. The reinforced army invaded Wessex and, although \u00c6thelred and Alfred won some victories and succeeded in preventing the conquest of their kingdom, a number of defeats and heavy losses of men compelled Alfred to pay the Danes to leave Wessex. The Danes spent the next few years subduing Mercia and some of them settled in Northumbria, but the rest returned to Wessex in 876. Alfred responded effectively and was able with little fighting to bring about their withdrawal in 877. A portion of the Danish army settled in Mercia, but at the beginning of 878 the remaining Danes mounted a winter invasion of Wessex, taking Alfred by surprise and overrunning much of the kingdom. Alfred was reduced to taking refuge with a small band of followers in the marshes of the Somerset Levels, but after a few months he was able to gather an army and defeated the Danes at the Battle of Edington, bringing about their final withdrawal from Wessex to settle in East Anglia.  Simultaneous Danish raids on the north coast of France and Brittany occurred in the 870s \u2013 prior to the establishment of Normandy in 911 \u2013 and recorded Danish alliances with both Bretons and Cornish may have resulted in the suppression of Cornish autonomy with the death by drowning of King Donyarth in 875 as recorded by the Annales Cambriae.

Offa won an important victory over Cynewulf at the Battle of Bensington (in Oxfordshire) in 779, reconquering some of the land along the Thames.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0209. No indisputably authentic charters from before this date show Cynewulf in Offa's entourage, and there is no evidence that Offa ever became Cynewulf's overlord. In 786, after the murder of Cynewulf, Offa may have intervened to place Beorhtric on the West Saxon throne. Even if Offa did not assist Beorhtric's claim, it seems likely that Beorhtric to some extent recognised Offa as his overlord shortly thereafter.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0141. Offa's currency was used across the West Saxon kingdom, and Beorhtric had his own coins minted only after Offa's death.Blackburn & Grierson, Early Medieval Coinage, pp.\u00a0281\u2013282. In 789, Beorhtric married Eadburh, a daughter of Offa; the Chronicle records that the two kings combined to exile Egbert to Francia for \"three years\", adding that \"Beorhtric helped Offa because he had his daughter as his queen\".Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p.\u00a062. Some historians believe that the Chronicles \"three years\" is an error, and should read \"thirteen years\", which would mean Egbert's exile lasted from 789 to 802, but this reading is disputed.E.g. Fletcher assumes that Egbert spent essentially all Beorhtric's reign in Francia; see Fletcher, Who's Who, p. 114. Similarly, Swanton annotates \"3 years\" with \"in fact thirteen years\u00a0... this error is common to all MSS.\" See note 12 in Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, pp. 62\u201363. On the other hand, Stenton accepts the figure as three: see Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 220. Stenton adds in a footnote that \"it is very dangerous to reject a reading which is so well attested\". Eadburh is mentioned by Asser, a 9th-century monk who wrote a biography of Alfred the Great: Asser says that Eadburh had \"power throughout almost the entire kingdom\", and that she \"began to behave like a tyrant after the manner of her father\".Keynes & Lapidge, Alfred the Great, p.\u00a071. Whatever power she had in Wessex was no doubt connected with her father's overlordship.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0147.", "The best known relic associated with Offa's time is Offa's Dyke, a great earthen barrier that runs approximately along the border between England and Wales. It is mentioned by the monk Asser in his biography of Alfred the Great: \"a certain vigorous king called Offa\u00a0... had a great dyke built between Wales and Mercia from sea to sea\".Asser, Alfred the Great, ch.\u00a014, p.\u00a071. The dyke has not been dated by archaeological methods, but most historians find no reason to doubt Asser's attribution.Margaret Worthington, \"Offa's Dyke\", in Lapidge, Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0341. Early names for the dyke in both Welsh and English also support the attribution to Offa.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0213. Despite Asser's comment that the dyke ran \"from sea to sea\", it is now thought that the original structure only covered about two-thirds of the length of the border: in the north it ends near Llanfynydd, less than  from the coast, while in the south it stops at Rushock Hill, near Kington in Herefordshire, less than  from the Bristol Channel. The total length of this section is about . Other earthworks exist along the Welsh border, of which Wat's Dyke is one of the largest, but it is not possible to date them relative to each other and so it cannot be determined whether Offa's Dyke was a copy of or the inspiration for Wat's Dyke.Margaret Worthington, \"Wat's Dyke\", in Lapidge et al., Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0468."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelwulf, King of Wessex", "response": ["\u00c6thelwulf was the son of Egbert, King of Wessex from 802 to 839. His mother's name is unknown, and he had no recorded siblings. He is known to have had two wives in succession, and so far as is known, Osburh, the senior of the two, was the mother of all his children. She was the daughter of Oslac, described by Asser, biographer of their son Alfred the Great, as \"King \u00c6thelwulf's famous butler\", a man who was descended from Jutes who had ruled the Isle of Wight. \u00c6thelwulf had six known children. His eldest son, \u00c6thelstan, was old enough to be appointed King of Kent in 839, so he must have been born by the early 820s, and he died in the early 850s. The second son, \u00c6thelbald, is first recorded as a charter witness in 841, and if, like Alfred, he began to attest when he was around six, he would have been born around 835; he was King of Wessex from 858 to 860. \u00c6thelwulf's third son, \u00c6thelberht, was probably born around 839 and was king from 860 to 865. The only daughter, \u00c6thelswith, married Burgred, King of Mercia, in 853. The other two sons were much younger: \u00c6thelred was born around 848 and was king from 865 to 871, and Alfred was born around 849 and was king from 871 to 899. In 856 \u00c6thelwulf married Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, King of West Francia and future Holy Roman Emperor, and his wife Ermentrude. Osburh had probably died, although it is possible that she had been repudiated. There were no children from \u00c6thelwulf's marriage to Judith, and after his death she married his eldest surviving son and successor, \u00c6thelbald.", "The early 20th-century historian W. H. Stevenson observed that: \"Few things in our early history have led to so much discussion\" as \u00c6thelwulf's Decimation Charters; a hundred years later the charter expert Susan Kelly described them as \"one of the most controversial groups of Anglo-Saxon diplomas\". Both Asser and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle say that \u00c6thelwulf gave a decimation, in 855, shortly before leaving on pilgrimage to Rome. According to the Chronicle \"King \u00c6thelwulf conveyed by charter the tenth part of his land throughout all his kingdom to the praise of God and to his own eternal salvation\". However, Asser states that \"\u00c6thelwulf, the esteemed king, freed the tenth part of his whole kingdom from royal service and tribute, and as an everlasting inheritance he made it over on the cross of Christ to the triune God, for the redemption of his soul and those of his predecessors.\" According to Keynes, Asser's version may just be a \"loose translation\" of the Chronicle, and his implication that \u00c6thelwulf released a tenth of all land from secular burdens was probably not intended. All land could be regarded as the king's land, so the Chronicle reference to \"his land\" does not necessarily refer to royal property, and since the booking of land\u00a0\u2013 conveying it by charter\u00a0\u2013 was always regarded as a pious act, Asser's statement that he made it over to God does not necessarily mean that the charters were in favour of the church.", "# One from Kent dated 855, the only one to have the same date as the decimation according to Chronicle and Asser. The king grants to his thegn Dunn property in Rochester \"on account of the decimation of lands which by God's gift I have decided to do\". Dunn left the land to his wife with reversion to Rochester Cathedral.", "On his way back from Rome \u00c6thelwulf again stayed with King Charles the Bald, and may have joined him on a campaign against a Viking warband. On 1 October 856 \u00c6thelwulf married Charles's daughter, Judith, aged 12 or 13, at Verberie. The marriage was considered extraordinary by contemporaries and by modern historians. Carolingian princesses rarely married and were usually sent to nunneries, and it was almost unknown for them to marry foreigners. Judith was crowned queen and anointed by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims. Although empresses had been anointed before, this is the first definitely known anointing of a Carolingian queen. In addition West Saxon custom, described by Asser as \"perverse and detestable\", was that the wife of a king of Wessex could not be called queen or sit on the throne with her husband\u00a0\u2013 she was just the king's wife.", "\u00c6thelbald's rebellion was supported by Ealhstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, ealdorman of Somerset, even though they appear to have been two of the king's most trusted advisers. According to Asser, the plot was concerted \"in the western part of Selwood\", and western nobles may have backed \u00c6thelbald because they resented the patronage \u00c6thelwulf gave to eastern Wessex. Asser also stated that \u00c6thelwulf agreed to give up the western part of his kingdom in order to avoid a civil war. Some historians such as Keynes and Abels think that his rule was then confined to the south-east, while others such as Kirby think it is more likely that it was Wessex itself which was divided, with \u00c6thelbald keeping Wessex west of Selwood, \u00c6thelwulf holding the centre and east, and \u00c6thelberht keeping the south-east. \u00c6thelwulf insisted that Judith should sit beside him on the throne until the end of his life, and according to Asser this was \"without any disagreement or dissatisfaction on the part of his nobles\".", "\u00c6thelwulf died on 13 January 858. According to the Annals of St Neots, he was buried at Steyning in Sussex, but his body was later transferred to Winchester, probably by Alfred. As \u00c6thelwulf had intended, he was succeeded by \u00c6thelbald in Wessex and \u00c6thelberht in Kent and the south-east. The prestige conferred by a Frankish marriage was so great that \u00c6thelbald then wedded his step-mother Judith, to Asser's retrospective horror; he described the marriage as a \"great disgrace\", and \"against God's prohibition and Christian dignity\". When \u00c6thelbald died only two years later, \u00c6thelberht became King of Wessex as well as Kent, and \u00c6thelwulf's intention of dividing his kingdoms between his sons was thus set aside. In the view of Yorke and Abels this was because \u00c6thelred and Alfred were too young to rule, and \u00c6thelberht agreed in return that his younger brothers would inherit the whole kingdom on his death, whereas Kirby and Nelson think that \u00c6thelberht just became the trustee for his younger brothers' share of their father's bequest.", "\u00c6thelwulf's reputation among historians was poor in the twentieth century. In 1935, the historian R. H. Hodgkin attributed his pilgrimage to Rome to \"the unpractical piety which had led him to desert his kingdom at a time of great danger\", and described his marriage to Judith as \"the folly of a man senile before his time\". To Stenton in the 1960s he was \"a religious and unambitious man, for whom engagement in war and politics was an unwelcome consequence of rank\". One dissenter was Finberg, who in 1964 described him as \"a king whose valour in war and princely munificence recalled the figures of the heroic age\", but in 1979 Enright said: \"More than anything else he appears to have been an impractical religious enthusiast.\" Early medieval writers, especially Asser, emphasise his religiosity and his preference for consensus, seen in the concessions made to avert a civil war on his return from Rome. In Story's view \"his legacy has been clouded by accusations of excessive piety which (to modern sensibilities at least) has seemed at odds with the demands of early medieval kingship\". In 839 an unnamed Anglo-Saxon king wrote to the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious asking for permission to travel through his territory on the way to Rome, and relating an English priest's dream which foretold disaster unless Christians abandoned their sins. This is now believed to have been an unrealised project of Egbert at the end of his life, but it was formerly attributed to \u00c6thelwulf, and seen as exhibiting what Story calls his reputation for \"dramatic piety\", and irresponsibility for planning to abandon his kingdom at the beginning of his reign."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex", "response": ["\u00c6thelbald married his stepmother Judith. Asser, the biographer of his youngest brother, Alfred the Great, denounced the union as being \"against God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and also contrary to the practice of all pagans\", but the marriage does not seem to have been condemned at the time. \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht appear to have been on good terms: when \u00c6thelbald died in 860 \u00c6thelberht became king of both Wessex and Kent, and they were never again divided.", "thumb|The two possible interpretations of Asser's description of the divided Wessex.", "\u00c6thelwulf spent a year in Rome. On his way back he stayed for several months with Charles the Bald, King of the West Franks, and married Charles's twelve-year-old daughter Judith, a great-granddaughter of Charlemagne; the bishop of Rheims ceremonially consecrated her and \u00c6thelwulf conferred the title of queen on her. \u00c6thelwulf returned with his new wife in October 856, and according to Alfred the Great's biographer, Bishop Asser, during his absence a plot was hatched to prevent the king's return and keep \u00c6thelbald on the throne. Asser regarded it as \"a terrible crime: expelling the king from his own kingdom; but God did not allow it to happen, nor would the nobles of the whole Saxon land have any part in it\". Asser stated that a great many men said that the initiative for \"this wretched incident, unheard of in all previous ages\" came from \u00c6thelbald's chief counsellors, Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, who had been two of \u00c6thelwulf's most senior advisers, while many blamed \u00c6thelbald himself.", "Rivalry between east and west Wessex may have also been a factor in the dispute. The ancient Selwood Forest marked the boundary between the bishoprics of Sherborne in the west and Winchester in the east. In the eighth century, the connections of Ecgberht's family were with the west, but in the early ninth century, the family became close to the clergy of Winchester, who helped them to establish an exclusive hold on the throne for their royal branch. According to Asser, the plot to rob \u00c6thelwulf of his throne was concocted in \"the western part of Selwood\", and \u00c6thelbald's chief supporters, Eahlstan and Eanwulf, were western magnates who probably resented the favour shown by \u00c6thelwulf to the eastern Winchester diocese, and to Swithun, who was appointed by \u00c6thelwulf as Bishop of Winchester in 852. \u00c6thelbald's patronage was mainly directed at Sherborne.", "Asser is the sole source for the dispute between \u00c6thelwulf and \u00c6thelbald, which is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and according to Asser when \u00c6thelwulf returned to England he agreed to divide the kingdom to avoid a civil war. Most historians state that \u00c6thelbald kept Wessex while \u00c6thelberht agreed to surrender the south-eastern kingdoms of Kent, Essex, Surrey and Sussex to \u00c6thelwulf, although Simon Keynes thinks that \u00c6thelwulf kept a degree of sovereignty. Some historians argue that it is more likely that Wessex itself was divided, with \u00c6thelbald keeping his power base west of Selwood, \u00c6thelwulf taking the east and \u00c6thelberht keeping Kent. Pauline Stafford and D. P. Kirby point out that Asser implies that Judith became queen of the West Saxons in 856. Sean Miller observes that Asser complained that the \"son ruled where by rightful judgment the father should have done; for the western part of the Saxon land has always been more important than the eastern\", and since Kent had been conquered only thirty years previously, it did not make sense to speak of it as having always been a less important part of the kingdom.", "According to Asser, at the end of his life, \u00c6thelwulf directed that his kingdom should be divided between his two eldest sons, and this was carried out when he died on 13 January 858. \u00c6thelbald then continued (or resumed) as king of Wessex, while \u00c6thelberht resumed (or kept) the kingship of Kent and the south-east. \u00c6thelwulf left a bequest to \u00c6thelbald, \u00c6thelred and Alfred, with the provision that whoever lived the longest was to inherit the whole; this is seen by some historians as leaving the kingship of Wessex to the survivor, but other historians dispute this and it may have been intended to provide for the younger sons. Judith's charisma as a Carolingian princess was so great that rather than lose the prestige of the connection \u00c6thelbald then married her. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle ignores the marriage, perhaps because mentioning such a prestigious connection of Alfred's older brother would have detracted from its focus on the achievements of Alfred himself. \u00c6thelbald's marriage to his widowed stepmother was subsequently condemned by Asser as \"against God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and also contrary to the practice of all pagans\", although it does not appear to have aroused opposition at the time. The Frankish Annals of St Bertin reported the marriage without comment, and stated that when she returned to her father after \u00c6thelbald's death, Judith was treated \"with all the honour due to a queen\". To her father's fury, soon afterwards she eloped with Baldwin, Count of Flanders, and their son Baldwin II married Alfred's daughter \u00c6lfthryth.", "\u00c6thelbald died in 860 and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle gives him a reign of five years, dating the start to 855 when \u00c6thelwulf left for Rome. Both Asser and the Annals of St Neots give \u00c6thelbald a rule of two and a half years, and the Annals adds that he also ruled for two and a half years jointly with his father. Most modern historians date his reign as 855 to 860, but some as 858 to 860. Only the year of his death is known, but as his father died in January 858 and he ruled for two and a half years thereafter, he probably died in about July 860. He was buried at Sherborne in Dorset and he is not known to have had any children.", "In the 890s, Bishop Asser gave the only surviving contemporary assessment of \u00c6thelbald. Asser, who was hostile to him both because of his revolt against his father and because of his uncanonical marriage, described him as \"iniquitous and grasping\" and his reign as \"two and a half lawless years\", adding that many people attributed the rebellion \"solely to arrogance on the part of King \u00c6thelbald, because he was grasping in this affair and many other wrongdoings\". Post-Conquest clerical chroniclers adopted Asser's views. William of Malmesbury wrote that \"\u00c6thelbald, who was worthless and disloyal to his father, defiled his father's marriage-bed, for after his father's death he sank so low as to marry his stepmother Judith.\" According to John of Worcester, \"\u00c6thelbald, in defiance of God's prohibition and Christian dignity, and even against all pagan customs, climbed into his father's marriage-bed, married Judith, daughter of Charles, king of the Franks, and held the government of the kingdom of the West Saxons without restraint for two and half years after his father's death\". Roger of Wendover condemned \u00c6thelbald in similar terms, but claimed that in 859 he repented of his error, put aside Judith and ruled thereafter \"in peace and righteousness\". The exception was Henry of Huntingdon, who stated that \u00c6thelbald and \u00c6thelberht, \"young men of superlative natural quality, possessed their kingdoms very prosperously as long as they each lived. When \u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex, had held his kingdom peacefully for five years, he was carried off by a premature death. All England lamented King \u00c6thelbald's youth and there was great sorrow over him. And they buried him at Sherborne. After this England was conscious of what it had lost in him.\"", "Robert Howard Hodgkin also adopted Asser's views in his 1935 History of the Anglo-Saxons, but later historians have been more circumspect. Frank Stenton in Anglo-Saxon England does not give any opinion on \u00c6thelbald, and observes that his marriage to Judith does not appear to have aroused any scandal among the churchmen of her country, while Sean Miller in his Dictionary of National Biography article on \u00c6thelbald says that very little is known of his reign after his marriage, but he appears to have been on good terms with \u00c6thelberht."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelberht, King of Wessex", "response": ["Anglo-Saxon charters provide the major source for \u00c6thelberht's life and narrative accounts are very limited.

In the following year \u00c6thelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome after appointing his eldest surviving son, \u00c6thelbald, under-king of Wessex and \u00c6thelberht under-king of Kent, Essex, Sussex and Surrey, appointments which suggest that his sons were to succeed to the separate kingdoms whether or not he returned to England. \u00c6thelberht attested charters as dux (ealdorman) in 854 and king in 855. In 856, \u00c6thelwulf returned to England with a new wife, Judith, daughter of Charles the Bald, king of the West Franks. \u00c6thelbald, with the support of Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, refused to give up his kingship of Wessex. \u00c6thelwulf compromised to avoid a civil war, but historians disagree how the kingdom was divided. According to Asser, \u00c6thelwulf was assigned the \"eastern districts\", and most historians assume that \u00c6thelbald kept Wessex while \u00c6thelberht gave up Kent to his father; some others believe that Wessex itself was divided, with \u00c6thelbald ruling the west and \u00c6thelwulf the east, and \u00c6thelberht retaining Kent.", "\u00c6thelwulf confirmed that he intended a permanent division of his kingdom as he recommended that on his death \u00c6thelbald should be king of Wessex and \u00c6thelberht king of Kent. This proposal was carried out when \u00c6thelwulf died in 858. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: \"And then \u00c6thelwulf's two sons succeeded to the kingdom: \u00c6thelbald to the kingdom of Wessex, and \u00c6thelberht to the kingdom of the inhabitants of Kent and to the kingdom of Essex and to Surrey and to the kingdom of Sussex\". \u00c6thelbald was later condemned by Alfred the Great's biographer, Asser, both for his rebellion against his father and because he married his father's widow, but he appears to have been on good terms with \u00c6thelberht. In 858 \u00c6thelbald issued a charter (S 1274) relating to land in Surrey, and thus in his brother's territory, and a charter he issued in 860 (S 326) was witnessed by \u00c6thelberht and Judith.", "According to Asser, who based his account of events before 887 mainly on the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: \"So after governing in peace, love and honour for five years, \u00c6thelberht went the way of all flesh, to the great sorrow of his people; and he lies buried honourably beside his brother, at Sherborne.\" Asser's view was followed by post-Conquest historians. John of Worcester copied Asser's words, while William of Malmesbury described him as \"a vigorous but kindly ruler\". The 20th-century historian Alfred Smyth points out that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was first written in Alfred the Great's reign, only recorded two events in \u00c6thelberht's reign, the attacks on Winchester and eastern Kent, and does not associate the king personally with either of them.

Offa was then the most powerful king in England, and Beorhtric gained his support as a result of the marriage. According to Asser, Eadburh became all powerful, and often demanded the executions or exile of her enemies. She was also alleged to have assassinated those men whom she couldn't compel Beorhtric to kill through poisoning their food or drink. In 802, according to Asser, Eadburh attempted to poison a young favourite of the king but instead killed both of them. The young man may have been called Worr, as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the death of both men shortly before the succession of Egbert, the grandfather of Alfred the Great, as king of Wessex.Janet L. Nelson, Eadburh, Oxford Online Dictionary of National Biography, 2004", "Eadburg subsequently fled to Francia and took refuge at the court of Charlemagne, where her husband's successor, Egbert of Wessex, had taken refuge after being exiled by Beorhtric. There Asser relates that Charlemagne was smitten by the former queen. He brought in one of his sons and asked her which she preferred, him or his son, as a husband. She answered that, given the son's youth, she preferred the son. Charlemagne replied famously: \"Had you chosen me, you would have had both of us. But, since you chose him, you shall have neither.\" He instead offered her a position as an abbess of a convent which she accepted.", "Two possibly authentic charters of 801 show Eadburh as regina (queen), a title which was rarely used for king's wives in Wessex in the ninth century. According to Asser this was because of the shame Eadburh had brought on the position. However, Offa and Beorhtric had driven Egbert into exile in the 780s, and the blackening of her name may also have been partly due to a desire to discredit Beorhtric.", "Asser also writes that as a result of the aristocracy's resentment of Eadburh the status and influence of the subsequent queens was diminished and they were titled not 'queen' but 'king's wife'; the queen was also prohibited from sitting beside the king on the throne. This changed again when Charles the Bald insisted that his daughter Judith, who married King \u00c6thelwulf, be properly crowned queen.", "*Keynes, Simon & Lapidge, Michael (eds & trans), Alfred the Great.
