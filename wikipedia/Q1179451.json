He was a midfielder but also played as a striker and represented his country at the under-16, under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. He is now employed as under-20s manager for Dundee.\nBorn in Chester, Johnson began his career with Crewe Alexandra and Manchester United's academies. He had loan spells with Royal Antwerp, Coventry City and Crewe Alexandra, before he was released by Manchester United in 2006 and joined Bradford City, where he played 64 league games in two seasons. He was released from Bradford in 2008, and after initially turning down a move to Chester City, he was given a trial at Crewe, which was unsuccessful, and instead he joined Chester where he spent six months before his contract was terminated to allow him to move to Austin Aztex. His form during two seasons in the United Soccer Leagues First Division won him a transfer to Portland Timbers at the end of the 2010 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Johnson", "response": ["*Eddie Johnson (musician) (1920\u20132010), American jazz musician", "*Eddie Johnson (American soccer) (born 1984), American soccer player", "*Eddie Johnson (racing driver) (1919\u20131974), American racecar driver", "*Eddie Johnson (English footballer) (born 1984), English footballer", "*Eddie Johnson (linebacker) (1959\u20132003), American football player", "*Eddie Johnson (punter) (born 1981), American football player", "*Eddie Johnson (basketball, born 1959), American basketball small forward", "*Eddie Johnson (basketball, born 1955) (1955\u20132020), American basketball guard", "*Eddie Johnson (boxer) (1927\u20131986), American Olympic boxer", "*Cousin Eddie Johnson, a redneck character in the National Lampoon's Vacation film series, played in each case by Randy Quaid"]}, {"page": "Steve Cronin", "response": ["On October 19, 2010 Cronin was named as one of the first four players to be signed by the Portland Timbers ahead of their expansion into Major League Soccer in 2011, along with Bright Dike, Ryan Pore and Eddie Johnson."]}, {"page": "Ryan Pore", "response": ["On October 19, 2010 Pore was named as one of the first four players to be signed by the Portland Timbers ahead of their expansion into Major League Soccer in 2011, along with Steve Cronin, Bright Dike and Eddie Johnson.Timbers announce first signed players for MLS"]}, {"page": "List of foreign MLS players", "response": ["*Eddie Johnson \u2013 Portland \u2013 2011"]}, {"page": "Royal Antwerp F.C.", "response": ["*  Eddie Johnson"]}, {"page": "List of people from Chester", "response": ["*Eddie Johnson (English footballer)."]}, {"page": "2001 UEFA European Under-16 Championship", "response": ["* Eddie Johnson"]}, {"page": "Eddie Johnson (English soccer player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eddie Johnson (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "Edward Johnson (English footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eddie Johnson (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "Edward Johnson (English soccer player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eddie Johnson (English footballer)"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Eddie Johnson||||2006\u20132008||64||7|| "]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Eddie Johnson"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|32||FW|| Eddie Johnson", "| Eddie Johnson"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Eddie Johnson"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["On 1 April 2008, first City's keeper Donovan Ricketts was blocked from coming back into the country following a Jamaica call-up, before City lost 2\u20131 at Rochdale, following a late winning goal from Rochdale's Adam Le Fondre.
