P. Moran, was an Irish journalist, activist and cultural-political theorist, known as the principal advocate of a specifically Gaelic Catholic Irish nationalism during the early 20th century. Associated with the wider Celtic Revival, he promoted his ideas primarily through his journal, The Leader, and compilations of his articles such as the book The Philosophy of Irish Ireland.\nHe was born in Manor, a townland in Waterford, the son of James Moran, a builder, and Elizabeth Casey.He was educated at Castleknock College, near Dublin before working as a journalist in London, where he was a member of the Irish Literary Society. His brand of nationalism and concept of Irish Ireland was of a homogeneous Gaelic Catholic nation, promoting the hegemony of the Irish language and Gaelic games in Irish cultural life. He often employed disparaging terms (\"West Brits\", \"shoneens\", \"sourfaces\") in reference to Unionists and/or non-Catholics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. B.

He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.Nally, Claire. 2010. Envisioning Ireland: W. B.

The pan-Celts were lampooned by D. P. Moran in The Leader, under the title of \"Pan-Celtic Farce.\" The folk costumes and druidic aesthetics were especially mocked, meanwhile Moran, who associated Irish nationality with Catholicism, was suspicious of the Protestantism of both Fournier and FitzPatrick. The participation of the latter as a \"Tommy Atkins\" against the Boers (whom Irish nationalists supported with the Irish Transvaal Brigade) was also highlighted as unsound. Moran concluded that pan-Celticism was \"parasitic\" from Irish nationalism, created by a \"foreigner\" (Fournier) and sought to misdirect Irish energies. Others were less polemical; opinion in the Gaelic League was divided and though they elected not to send an official representative, some members did attend Congress meetings (including Douglas Hyde, Patrick Pearse and Michael Davitt).. More enthusiastic was Lady Gregory, who imagined an Ireland-led \"Pan-Celtic Empire\", while William Butler Yeats also attended the Dublin meeting. Prominent Gaelic League activists such as Pearse, Edward Martyn, John St. Clair Boyd, Thomas William Rolleston, Thomas O'Neill Russell, Maxwell Henry Close and William Gibson all made financial contributions to the Pan-Celtic Congress.
