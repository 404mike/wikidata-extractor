P. Moran, was an Irish journalist, activist and cultural-political theorist, known as the principal advocate of a specifically Gaelic Catholic Irish nationalism during the early 20th century. Associated with the wider Celtic Revival, he promoted his ideas primarily through his journal, The Leader, and compilations of his articles such as the book The Philosophy of Irish Ireland.\nHe was born in Manor, a townland in Waterford, the son of James Moran, a builder, and Elizabeth Casey.He was educated at Castleknock College, near Dublin before working as a journalist in London, where he was a member of the Irish Literary Society. His brand of nationalism and concept of Irish Ireland was of a homogeneous Gaelic Catholic nation, promoting the hegemony of the Irish language and Gaelic games in Irish cultural life. He often employed disparaging terms (\"West Brits\", \"shoneens\", \"sourfaces\") in reference to Unionists and/or non-Catholics.", "link_mentions": {}}}
