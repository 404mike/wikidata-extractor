Additionally, the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden, and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946. They lost 6\u20131 on aggregate to West Ham United in the third round of the 1945\u201346 FA Cup, and upon the league's resumption in 1946\u201347 the club finished 13th, their worst in 17 years.  Allison decided to retire from football at the end of that season, and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker, a long-time servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman.  Whittaker enjoyed immediate success, winning the League title in the 1947\u201348 season; led by captain Joe Mercer's strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke, Arsenal were top of the table from October until the season's climax, winning by a seven-point margin. However, given the age of the Arsenal side at the time (Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty, as were brothers Denis and Leslie Compton), long-term success was not possible. In response, Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman, Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton. Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title, with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 1949\u201350, with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 2\u20130 win over Liverpool in the final."]}, {"page": "1953 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["In the match, Blackpool started strongly and scored first with Stan Mortensen's goal in the 30th minute.
