Hibs recorded five wins from nine matches towards the end of the 2001\u201302 season, which ensured that they retained their place in the SPL. Williamson's time in charge was seemingly 'jinxed' by conceding late goals. A memorable example of this was when Hibs themselves scored two late goals at Tynecastle to take a 4\u20132 lead against Hearts on 2 January 2003, only to concede two even later goals by Graham Weir to give Hearts an unlikely 4\u20134 draw. Despite indifferent results under Williamson, a string of exciting young players including Garry O\u2019Connor, Derek Riordan, Kevin Thomson and Scott Brown started to emerge. These players featured heavily as Hibs eliminated both halves of the Old Firm to reach the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, only to lose 2\u20130 to Livingston. Williamson departed near the end of the 2003\u201304 season to manage Plymouth Argyle."]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["This revival meant that they were in a good league position going into the third Edinburgh derby of the season, on 2 January, where victory would mean that Hibs would leapfrog Hearts into third place.High drama in Edinburgh derby, BBC Sport, 2 January 2003.
