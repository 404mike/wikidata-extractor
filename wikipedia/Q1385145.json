As the squadron had had a number of commanding officers including Guy Gibson, Harold Martin and Leonard Cheshire this was not helpful in maintaining the continuity of the narrative. Eventually he discovered that not only was Barnes Wallis involved with the squadron in developing the bouncing bombs used during  Operation Chastise but he had also designed the Grand Slam and Tallboy bombs used by the squadron later in the war. After meeting with Wallis in the summer of 1950 he decided that here was the book's central figure, a driven man who overcame great odds set against the tragedy of the heavy losses that the squadron endured.Dando-Collins.

This proved invaluable and allowed Gibson to plot a course that avoided the majority of the flak posts."]}]}}
