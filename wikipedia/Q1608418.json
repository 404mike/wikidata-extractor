All hatches and means of ventilation were open to cool the ship. There was a  hole in the side of the ship open to the sea, but initially, Tryon and his navigation officer, Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, did not believe the ship would sink, as the damage was forward and had not affected the engine room or ship's power. Tryon gave orders to turn the ship and head for the shore  away so she could be beached. Some of the surrounding ships had launched boats for a rescue, but he signalled for them to turn back. Just two minutes after Camperdown backed out of the hole she had created, water was advancing over the deck and spilling into the open hatches. A party under Lieutenant Herbert Heath attempted to unroll a collision mat down the side of the ship to patch the hole and slow the inrush of water, but by the time they could manhandle it into position they were standing in water, and had to abandon the attempt. Five minutes after the collision, the bow had already sunk , the ship was listing heavily to starboard and water was coming through the gun ports in the large forward turret. The foredeck became submerged, with the top of the gun turret forming a small island. Although the engine room was still manned and the engines running, hydraulic power for the helm failed so the ship could not be turned and there was no power to launch the ship's boats. Eight minutes after the collision, the entire fore end of the ship was under water, and the water was lapping the main deck. The stern had risen so that the screws were nearly out of the water.Hough pp. 82\u201386."]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty", "response": ["**Sir Herbert Heath, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Herbert Heath, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Herbert Heath, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Herbert Heath, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Herbert Heath, Second Sea Lord", "**Sir Herbert Heath, Second Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Brighton College", "response": ["*Admiral Sir Herbert Heath (1861\u20131954), Rear-Admiral Commanding 2nd Cruiser Squadron at Jutland in 1916, Second Sea Lord"]}, {"page": "King of Arms of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["|Admiral Sir Herbert Heath, KCB, MVO"]}, {"page": "HMS Repulse (1892)", "response": ["With the refit complete, Repulse recommissioned at Chatham, under the command of Captain Henry Totteham, on 3 January 1905 for service in reserve with a nucleus crew.
