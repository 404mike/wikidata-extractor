He was born at Half Way Tree, Kingston, Jamaica and died at Zillebeke, Belgium in the Ypres area of fighting in the First World War.\nSutton was a left-handed middle- or lower-order batsman and an occasional slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. He was educated at King's School, Bruton where he was described in the school magazine as \"a good hard-hitting bat with plenty of strokes, notably an excellent off-drive, a magnificent shot just behind point, a good late cut and a fine powerful pull.\" He also opened the bowling for the school team. He was still at school when he made his first appearances for Somerset: in his debut match against Hampshire at Southampton in May 1909 he made 30 in Somerset's second innings after Hampshire enforced the follow on; that was to be his highest score in first-class cricket. In 1912, Sutton appeared in 11 of Somerset's first-class games, but he made only 118 runs in total with a highest score of only 24, and he did not appear in first-class cricket after this season.Sutton was a lance-sergeant in the Canadian Infantry (Central Ontario Regiment) at the time of his death in the First World War. His name is commemorated on the Menin Gate at Ypres. The King's Bruton magazine indicates that he was attached to the 4th Canadian Mounted Rifles, though CMR records on the internet do not support this.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Menin Gate", "response": ["* Lance-Sergeant Leonard Sutton, English first-class cricketer (serving with Canadians)"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Leonard Sutton (1909\u20131912) 17 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Harold Hippisley", "response": ["Hippisley was educated at King's School, Bruton where he was captain of cricket, hockey and football. As a cricketer, he was \"a forceful batsman, a cunning bowler and a fine fielder\". He joined his King's Bruton team-mate Leonard Sutton in the Somerset side late in the 1909 season and in his first match, playing against Worcestershire and batting at No 9, he made an unbeaten 40, which proved to be his highest first-class score. He played in all just seven times for Somerset and had only one other successful match: against Northamptonshire in 1913 he made 14 and 36, though Somerset lost the game heavily. He did not bowl in first-class cricket. In minor cricket, he scored 150 for the Old Brutonians team against Sidmouth in 1911, sharing a second wicket partnership of 396 with Percy Vasey, who made 282."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Leonard Sutton"]}, {"page": "Sutton, Leonard", "response": ["#redirectLeonard Sutton"]}]}}
