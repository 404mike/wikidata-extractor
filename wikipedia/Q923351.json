The series had been attempted before, during the early 1980s, when Croft was working with his other regular writing partner, Jeremy Lloyd. Lloyd eventually conceded that he was struggling to find enthusiasm in the series and instead turned to an idea for a sitcom about the French Resistance which became 'Allo 'Allo!. Five years later Perry and Croft seriously turned their attention to the project. The series is not as well-known as the other Perry and Croft sitcoms and was not initially well-received by the critics. Despite this the series regularly attracted audiences ratings of 10 million and has been very popular in Hungary. The series featured many cast members from other series that Perry had worked on, including Michael Knowles and Donald Hewlett from It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Paul Shane, Jeffrey Holland and Su Pollard from Hi-de-Hi!, and Bill Pertwee from Dad's Army.

Perry also wanted Su Pollard to feature in the series as a local Briton wearing square wooden glasses. David Croft was not keen and the series was never taken any further, it was also later pointed out that the series may have been too similar to Up Pompeii! and Monty Python's Life of Brian. In 2009, Perry admitted that he had also written a pilot for another series saying \"The idea I thought could have worked.

It was there that he also met many of his future co-stars, including Michael Knowles, Donald Hewlett, and Mavis Pugh (whom he married in 1959). Pugh appeared in Croft and Perry sitcoms including Dad's Army, It Ain't Half Hot Mum and Hi-de-Hi!, but she is best known for playing Lady Lavender Southwick in You Rang, M'Lord?. Due to the twenty year age gap between Clegg and Pugh many were sceptical as to whether the marriage would last, apart from Jimmy Perry and his wife Gillian.

Greaves in Dixon of Dock Green in 1961. Clegg\u2019s first film appearance was as a minor role in the 1967 Musical film Half a Sixpence, playing a shop assistant.
