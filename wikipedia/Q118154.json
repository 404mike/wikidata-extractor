It was first released on 31 January 2000 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and on 2 May 2000 in the United States by Astralwerks.https://www.allmusic.com/album/xtrmntr-mw0000260651/releases It peaked at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart. In a departure from their earlier, more hedonistic recordings, the band took a more political stance on the album, attacking government, police, and multinational corporations. Its sound is more aggressive and forceful than Primal Scream's previous output, with harsh, electronic sounds reminiscent of industrial music forming the basis for many of its songs. Although Gary Mounfield joined the band in 1997 and recorded a selection of tracks on their previous album Vanishing Point (1997), it marked the first time he shared songwriting credits with them, as well as his first full album since his time with The Stone Roses. The album is notable for being the final full-length release on Creation Records, with the track \"Accelerator\" later lifted to become the final single released on the label."]}, {"page": "Xaverian College", "response": ["* Gary Mounfield: musician, member of The Stone Roses"]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Gary Mounfield (Aka Mani) (The Stone Roses, Primal Scream)"]}]}}
