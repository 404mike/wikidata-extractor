But film historian Monica Silveira Cyrino discounted this statement in 2005, and said there were no published accounts of any serious injuries or deaths during filming of the chariot race. Indeed, the only recorded death to occur during the filming was that of producer Sam Zimbalist, who died of a heart attack at the age of 57 on November 4, 1958, while on the set.\"Sam Zimbalist, 57, Film-Maker, Dead.\" The New York Times.

Production supervisor Henry Henigson was so overcome by stress-related heart problems during the shoot that doctors feared for his life and ordered him off the set. Henigson, however, returned to the production shortly thereafter and did not die.  Nor were any horses injured during the shoot; in fact, the number of hours that the horses could be used each day was actually shortened to keep them out of the summer heat.Herman, p. 408."]}, {"page": "The Stick Up", "response": ["* Nosher Powell as Manager "]}, {"page": "The Morning After (The Avengers)", "response": ["*Nosher Powell as Ministry Guard"]}, {"page": "Venom (1971 film)", "response": ["*Nosher Powell as Gang member"]}]}}
