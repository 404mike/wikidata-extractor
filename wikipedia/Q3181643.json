(1957).He specialised in studying the taxonomy of wild potato species (Solanum sect. Petota), identified sources of resistance to the potato cyst nematode and played a role in establishing programs to maintain agricultural biodiversity.He was awarded the OBE in the 1994 Birthday Honours. In 1985 he was awarded the Linnean Medal for Botany by the Linnean Society.He treated much of the Solanaceae for Flora Europaea, started the Solanaceae Newsletter and organised the first Symposium on the Solanaceae.At Birmingham he started the M.Sc. course in the Conservation and Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources, which trained international students.Working with Birmingham Natural History Society and Dorothy Cadbury he produced \"A computer - mapped flora and study of the county of Warwickshire\" (1971). This was an innovative use of computers at the time using Punched tape storage, which led to problems later on when the computer department updated their system and the old tapes had to be read slowly so as not to damage them.In 1977, Argentinian botanist Armando Theodoro Hunziker named a genus of plants from South America , Hawkesiophyton(belonging to the family Solanaceae) after Hawkes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in September 2007", "response": ["*Jack Hawkes, 92, British botanist.Professor Jack Hawkes"]}, {"page": "Carlos M.
