Manchester United's involvement in the FIFA Club World Championship meant they did not enter the FA Cup. To decide who took their place, a \"lucky losers\" draw was held from the 20 teams knocked out in the second round; Darlington were selected, and lost their third-round tie 2\u20131 to Aston Villa at Villa Park. Their second Wembley appearance came later that season, facing Peterborough United in the play-off final after automatic promotion had seemed certain earlier in the season. After a 3\u20130 aggregate semi-final win over Hartlepool United, Quakers missed numerous chances and were again undone by a single goal, this time from Andy Clarke.", "Feethams was originally used by Darlington Cricket Club, but began to be used for football in the 1860s. Darlington F.C. began playing there when they formed in 1883. With growing crowd figures, the ground was expanded with the construction of the West stand at the turn of the century and the Polam Lane end in 1905. In 1913, a pair of towers were built at the entrance to the ground, and in 1920, offices and changing rooms were built underneath the East stand. Floodlights were installed in September 1960, but after their first use an electrical fault gutted the West stand in a fire, prompting its rebuilding. In 1997, the East stand was demolished and rebuilt as an all-seater stand, but its cost had a major negative effect on the club's finances. George Reynolds came in to the club, paid its debts and initiated construction of a new stadium. The last match played at Feethams was a 2\u20132 draw with Leyton Orient on 3 May 2003. Following the closure of the ground, the floodlights were sold to Workington A.F.C. and the stadium demolished. A housing estate was planned for the cleared site.", "The team's mascots included Mr Q, \"a flat-looking cartoon man with a very big hat\", Darlo Dog, a Dalmatian who was once ejected from the ground for climbing on the advertising boards in front of television cameras, and a panda named Feethams. Fanzines included Mission Impossible, first published in the early 1990s, and Where's The Money Gone, whose teenage editor, along with the editor of the Darlo Uncovered website, were among several supporters banned from the ground by chairman George Reynolds for criticising the running of the club. Since 2013, a fan-run internet radio station, Darlo Fans Radio, has provided commentary on Darlington matches both home and away."]}, {"page": "George Reynolds", "response": ["George Reynolds may refer to:", "* George Reynolds (MP for Devizes) (died 1577), English politician", "* George Reynolds (MP for Rye) (died 1577), English politician", "* George Reynolds (basketball) (born 1947), American basketball player", "* George Reynolds (boxer), Welsh lightweight boxing champion", "* George Reynolds (racing driver) (1928\u20132012), winner of the 1964 Bathurst 500", "* George Reynolds (priest), English priest, served as Archdeacon of Lincoln from 1725 to 1769", "* George Reynolds (businessman) (1937-2021), British businessman and chairman of Darlington Football Club", "* George Reynolds (Mormon) (1842\u20131909), Latter-day Saint leader and a party to the 1878 United States Supreme Court case Reynolds v.
