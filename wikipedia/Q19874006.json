This work helped inspire Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals (1997), a collection of essays exploring different scenarios by a number of historians, edited by the historian Niall Ferguson. Ferguson has become a significant advocate of counterfactual history, using counterfactual scenarios to illustrate his objections to deterministic theories of history such as Marxism, and to put forward a case for the importance of contingency in history, theorizing that a few key changes could result in a significantly different modern world. A series of \"What If?\" books edited by Robert Cowley presented dozens of essays by historians or prominent writers about \"how a slight turn of fate at a decisive moment could have changed the very annals of time.\""]}, {"page": "David Runciman, 4th Viscount Runciman of Doxford", "response": ["In October 2014, he was appointed head of the Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of Cambridge.
