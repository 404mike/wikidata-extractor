He was born at Empingham, Rutland and died at Kettering, Northamptonshire. The precise date of his birth is not known.\nTomblin was educated at Uppingham School and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a left-handed middle- or lower-order batsman. He made an unbeaten 31 on his first-class debut for Cambridge University against the Marylebone Cricket Club, but achieved very little in his other games for the university, the last of which was the 1857 University Match, in which he scored 12 and 0. In 1862, Tomblin returned for a single further first-class game, a match between amateur teams from the North and the South of England, and made his highest score, 46, in his final first-class innings.Tomblin graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1858. He was ordained as a Church of England deacon in 1859 and as a priest the following year; he served as curate at Great Oakley, Northamptonshire from 1858 to 1863 when he became vicar of the same parish through to 1900. He continued to live in Great Oakley after his retirement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tomblin", "response": ["*Arthur Tomblin (1836\u20131911), English cricketer"]}]}}
