Having recently completed a large public art project \u2014 \"Made in England\" \u2014 based on the visual culture and ideology of the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent (in the English midlands), her work has become increasingly concerned with the ceramic industry and its social history. As a fine artist Emma Biggs makes abstract paintings with her husband, Matthew Collings. The processes, formats and titles of the paintings also relate to her interest in material culture. She has written Mosaic Techniques (Cassell, 2003) and several other books co-authored with Tessa Hunkin, who joined her after she founded the London-based Mosaic Workshop in 1988. Mosaic Workshop have been responsible for a number of high-profile commissions including work for some of the chapels in London's Westminster Cathedral. She is a regular tutor of short courses in mosaic art at West Dean College, the study centre of the Edward James Foundation. She also lectures at City and Guilds of London Art School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mosaic", "response": ["Some modern mosaics are the work of modernisme style architects Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Josep Maria Jujol, for example the mosaics in the Park G\u00fcell in Barcelona.
