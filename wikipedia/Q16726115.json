The historian Barbara Yorke argues that there were two co-rulers of Kent after \u00c6thelberht's death, Eadbald and a \u00c6thelwald, and that Eadbald was converted by Laurence while \u00c6thelwald was converted by Justus after his return to Rochester.Yorke Kings and Kingdoms p. 32 Another factor in the pagan reaction was Laurence's objection to Eadbald's marriage to his father's widow, something that Christians considered to be unlawful.Yorke Conversion p. 123"]}, {"page": "Mercia", "response": ["For 300 years (between 600 and 900), having annexed or gained submissions from five of the other six kingdoms of the Heptarchy (East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex and Wessex), Mercia dominated England south of the River Humber: this period is known as the Mercian Supremacy. The reign of King Offa, who is best remembered for his Dyke that designated the boundary between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms, is sometimes known as the \"Golden Age of Mercia\". Nicholas Brooks noted that \"the Mercians stand out as by far the most successful of the various early Anglo-Saxon peoples until the later ninth century\",* and some historians, such as Sir Frank Stenton, believe the unification of England south of the Humber estuary was achieved during the reign of Offa."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelwulf, King of Wessex", "response": ["\u00c6thelwulf was first recorded in 825, when Egbert won the crucial Battle of Ellandun in Wiltshire against King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending the long Mercian ascendancy over southern England. Egbert followed it up by sending \u00c6thelwulf with Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Wulfheard, Ealdorman of Hampshire, with a large army into Kent to expel sub-king Baldred. \u00c6thelwulf was descended from kings of Kent, and he was sub-king of Kent, and of Surrey, Sussex and Essex, which were then included in the sub-kingdom, until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839. His sub-kingship is recorded in charters, in some of which King Egbert acted with his son's permission, such as a grant in 838 to Bishop Beornmod of Rochester, and \u00c6thelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year. Unlike their Mercian predecessors, who alienated the Kentish people by ruling from a distance, \u00c6thelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests. In Abels' view, Egbert and \u00c6thelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters. Historians take differing views on the attitude of the new regime to the Kentish church. At Canterbury in 828 Egbert granted privileges to the bishopric of Rochester, and according to the historian of Anglo-Saxon England Simon Keynes, Egbert and \u00c6thelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred. However, the medievalist Nicholas Brooks argues that Wulfred's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability. \u00c6thelwulf seized an estate in East Malling from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces; the issue of archiepiscopal coinage was suspended for several years; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King Wiglaf of Mercia."]}, {"page": "\u00c6thelstan", "response": ["More legal texts survive from \u00c6thelstan's reign than from any other tenth-century English king.

Established in the 11th century as a motte-and-bailey design within an Anglo-Saxon burgh, it grew to become what historian Nicholas Brooks has described as \"one of the most powerful royal castles of the 12th and 13th centuries\". During The Anarchy the castle held the Empress Matilda and her son the future King Henry II. It was the site of the signing of the Treaty of Wallingford, which began the end of the conflict and set the path to a negotiated peace. Over the next two centuries Wallingford became a luxurious castle, used by royalty and their immediate family. After being abandoned as a royal residence by Henry VIII, the castle fell into decline."]}, {"page": "Penda of Mercia", "response": ["Bede, in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, says of Penda that he was \"a most warlike man of the royal race of the Mercians\" and that, following Edwin of Northumbria's defeat in 633 (see below), he ruled the Mercians for 22 years with varying fortune.Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Book II, Chapter XX.8 The noted 20th-century historian Frank Stenton was of the opinion that the language used by Bede \"leaves no doubt that ... Penda, though descended from the royal family of the Mercians, only became their king after Edwin's defeat\".Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, page 81.1 The Historia Brittonum accords Penda a reign of only ten years,HB, Chapter 65.3 perhaps dating it from the time of the Battle of Maserfield (see below) around 642, although according to the generally accepted chronology this would still be more than ten years. Given the apparent problems with the dates given by the Chronicle and the Historia, Bede's account of the length of Penda's reign is generally considered the most plausible by historians. Nicholas Brooks noted that, since these three accounts of the length of Penda's reign come from three different sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are West Saxon, Northumbrian, and Welsh), they may merely reflect the times at which their respective peoples first had military involvement with Penda."]}, {"page": "Stigand", "response": ["The papacy refused to recognise Stigand's elevation, as Robert was still alive and had not been deprived of office by a pope.

He argues that in 1062 papal legates sat in council with Stigand, something they would not have done had he been excommunicated.Brooks Early History p. 307 The legates did nothing to alter Stigand's position either,Rex Harold II p. 184 although one of the legates later helped depose Stigand in 1070.Barlow English Church 1000\u20131066 p. 306 However Pope Leo IX and his successors, Victor II and Stephen IX, continued to regard Stigand as uncanonically elected.Blair Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England p. 108"]}, {"page": "Creoda of Mercia", "response": ["Yorke's sentiment is shared by Professor of Medieval History Nicholas Brooks, who wrote: \"Despite Professor Davies's tentative advocacy of the historicity of this material, it cannot be said that it is yet clear that what lies behind these scattered entries in the works of Henry of Huntingdon, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris is anything more important than some inventive conjectures by an English monk, perhaps as late as the early twelfth century, on the basis of the names available in Bede, the Mercian royal genealogy and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.

Brooks noted that if Eowa was a Northumbrian puppet, there would be the possibility that Oswald may have made moves to promote Christianity in Mercia at this time, thus accounting for the presence of monks in what was still a pagan kingdom.

The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian's letter, Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit's replacement, not least of which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid, who was in Kent and Mercia at the time, not be selected as the new archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu's involvement in Wighard's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo-Saxon church, and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric.Kirby Earliest English Kings pp. 89\u201390 Brooks points out that one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium. As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy, Wighard's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury p. 134"]}, {"page": "Feologild", "response": ["Feologild attended the Council of Clovesho in 803, and was listed on the acts of that council as an abbot of a Kentish monastery.Hunt \"Feologeld (d. 832)\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He was elected to the see of Canterbury in early 832 and consecrated on 9\u00a0June\u00a0832.
