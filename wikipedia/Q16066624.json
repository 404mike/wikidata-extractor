The plans as designed by Alfred Grindle followed the English collegiate style layout with a chancel nearly as long as the nave. Due to funding restrictions, only the nave and crossing were constructed according to the plans. A wooden structure served as the chancel, significantly limiting the architectural impact of the building. By the late 1950s this clapboard annex was structurally unsound, and a new brick apse and sacristy designed by the firm Evans Woollen and Associates replaced the old chancel. The curved wall of the new apse contrasts greatly with the rectilinear rigidity of the Gothic nave. This dissonance is viewed by many as a stylistic strength of the building in its blending of hard and soft architectural forms. Acoustically, the curved apse wall promotes dissemination and reverberation of sound, creating a space much noted for its use in musical performance."]}, {"page": "University Courts Historic District", "response": ["| Designed by Alfred Grindle ", "| Alfred Grindle drew plans for Indiana University football coach Ewald O.

Weatherhogg", "response": ["He settled in Fort Wayne, working briefly with the firm of Wing & Mahurin, before he opened an office with Alfred Grindle, himself a fellow Wing and Mahurin employee. Grindle and Weatherhogg maintained a partnership from about 1893-1897. They had a branch office in Muncie and designed a number of large homes in that city. Their most important project together was the Jasper County Courthouse, 1897, also in Rensselaer. Grindle first received the commission for the Jasper County Courthouse, then brought in Weatherhogg.  Grindle left the project entirely to Weatherhogg, who then completed most of the design work. The courthouse is an imposing three story limestone building with tower executed in the Chateauesque/Tudor Revival style. Weatherhogg went on to design a number of buildings in Fort Wayne, including several schools, the Masonic Temple, Blackstone Building, Fairfield Apartments, and the People's Trust and Savings Bank. Although adept at many styles, Weatherhogg often used a variant of classicism in his works Rensselaer Carnegie Library, 94000233; National Register of Historic Places Inventory \u2013 Nomination Form; US Dept of the Interior, National Park Service;  Washington, D.C.;  March 1994", "Weatherhogg had a brief partnership with Alfred Grindle until Grindle moved to Muncie."]}]}}
