Although they won the DFL Supercup, this was their only silverware this season. After a scrappy first half of the season, they changed their tactics and made a few more transfers in the January Window. They were eliminated in both the DFB-Pokal and the UEFA Champions League as well. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, the season stopped abruptly. Once the restart occurred, Dortmund looked better but their performances were not enough to stop a dominant Bayern Munich side from grasping the Bundesliga title.

These players are usually tall and physically strong, adept at heading the ball, and capable of playing with their back to goal in the final third of the pitch. Some of the most high-profile examples of this type of players in modern football include Olivier Giroud and Fernando Llorente, both World Cup winners, with the former having played the entire tournament as a starting line-up forward tasked primarily with pressing, counter-pressing, winning high or loose balls, and providing key passes to quicker and more agile teammates, namely Antoine Griezmann and/or Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Another example of a striker who played in this position is Didier Drogba. However, not any tall and/or physically strong player feels comfortable in the role of a \"target man\", despite having all the necessary features. Such forwards as Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Romelu Lukaku, and Erling Haaland have all rejected the term when applied to specifically them, with Ibrahimovi\u0107 preferring to be described as an attacking all-rounder, while Lukaku and Haaland have said to favor poaching goals rather than physical play."]}, {"page": "FIFA (video game series)", "response": ["* Cover athlete: Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (Standard, Champions & Ultimate Editions) Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, and Erling Haaland will become three ambassadors."]}]}}
