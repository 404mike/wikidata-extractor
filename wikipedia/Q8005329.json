It is likely that he began in theatre as a child actor: Augustine Phillips bequeathed \"his servant\" Beeston thirty shillings in his 1605 last will and testament, indicating that Beeston had been that actor's apprentice with the Lord Chamberlain's Men. Beeston played in the company's 1598 production of Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564\u20131964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 57.

George Jolly's troupe also played there for a time.  Samuel Pepys records visiting it several times in his diary for early 1661 (often calling it the Whitefriars Theatre)."]}, {"page": "King and Queen's Young Company", "response": ["The King and Queen's Young Company was onstage in early 1637, and was a hit; they and their reputation quickly entered public consciousness under their popular nickname. Yet the theatrical profession, in a time of plague and looming revolution, remained challenging; when Christopher Beeston died in 1638, his control of acting troupes and theatres (the Cockpit and the Red Bull) passed to his son and successor William Beeston, who was notably less successful than his father. (This period of crisis would likely have been difficult to navigate, even for a very resourceful individual.) William Beeston inherited the Phoenix theatre from his father and everything that went with it, which included the young company Beeston's Boys. While Beeston had none of the experience that his father had, he still took on the mantle of managing the company since he had \"a one-twelfth interest in the King and Queen\u2019s young company\"Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 2. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print.", "Christopher Beeston was a very talented man that \"managed five Phoenix companies: Queen Anne's (1617\u201319), Prince Charles\u2019s (1619\u201322), Lady Elizabeth\u2019s (1622\u20135), Henrietta Maria\u2019s (1625\u201337) and the King and Queen\u2019s Young company\".Sturgess, Keith. Jacobean Private Theatre. Vol. 6. London: Routledge & K. Paul, 1987. Print. Beeston already had an immense amount of experience in the theatre profession from managing these companies and he also had the copyright to many of the plays performed at the Phoenix, which was very unordinary at the time.Sturgess, Keith. Jacobean Private Theatre. Vol. 6. London: Routledge & K. Paul, 1987. Print. Beeston's Boys performed plays including Cupid's Revenge, The Knight of the Burning Pestle and The Court Beggar.Munro, Lucy. Children of the Queen's Revels: A Jacobean Theatre Repertory. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2005. Print. The last play, The Court Beggar, got Beeston's Boys in a severe amount of trouble that resulted in William Davenant taking over the theatre for an interim time. By possessing such a large repertoire, the Beeston's Boys were able to quickly get up and running and compete with such acting companies like the Queen's Men. William Beeston was then sworn as governor of the company to succeed his father on 5 April 1639 (Bentley 1:330)", "William Beeston was sent to the Marshalsea prison on 4 May 1640; Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, gave control of the theatres and their associated actors' companies to Sir William Davenant, playwright and manager. During this time Beeston's boys were not nearly as successful due to William Davenant's being busy with other endeavours at the time. Most of his time was possessed by something called \"the Army Plot\".Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 1. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print. The Lord Chamberlain did not predict this when he gave the governor position to Davenant, so when Davenant fled the country the Lord Chamberlain was forced to bring William Beeston back. Due to this turn of events, Beeston was released on bail from the prison and reclaimed his position as governor of the Phoenix in 1641.", "Beeston's Boys were disbanded along with every other theatre in London when the Coup d'\u00e9tat led by Oliver Cromwell happened. 2 September 1642 was the day that every theatre company was outlawed from performing.Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 1. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print. There is not much else that is mentioned about Beeston's Boys after this time, but it is suspected that the company continued acting in the 1650s since there is a reference of William Beeston training another group of boys to take the stage. Beeston made repairs to the theatre in 1650 in the hopes that the company could start anew.Bentley, Gerald Eades. The Jacobean and Caroline Stage. Vol. 2. Oxford: Clarendon, 1941. Print. Even after the London theatres were closed in 1642, William Beeston maintained a long-term commitment to re-establishing the Beeston's Boys company. He made a significant effort in 1650, during the Interregnum. Contrary to popular opinion, all dramatic activity in London did not cease with the 1642 closing of the theatres; there was a notable burst of activity in the late 1640s \u2013 players would perform plays for audiences, the London authorities would suppress them, and players would try again, whenever they thought they could get away with it. In the midst of this activity, William Beeston paid for repairs to the Cockpit Theatre and attempted to gather together a group of \"apprentices and covenant servants\" to train them for the stage.Michael Shapiro, \"The Introduction of Actresses in England: Delay or Defensiveness?,\" in Comensoli and Russell, p. 184.

Hammerton fared better, though; sometime in 1632 he jumped to, or was recruited into, the King's Men. His transition was not without controversy; manager Blagrave was involved in a lawsuit over control of the apprentice actor.G. E. Bentley, \"The Salisbury Court Theater and Its Boy Players,\" Huntington Library Quarterly Vol. 40 No. 2 (February 1977), pp. 129-49. In November 1632, Blagrave joined with William Beeston in a petition to the Lord Chamberlain to recover custody of Hammerton. Beeston's involvement in the matter is cryptic, and the Blagrave/Beeston suit was unsuccessful;Bentley, pp. 143-4, 148-9.

They were working in the Salisbury Court Theatre by September of that year.Robert Latham and William Matthews, The Diary of Samuel Pepys Companion, Los Angeles, University of California Press, 2000; pp. 433\u20134.
