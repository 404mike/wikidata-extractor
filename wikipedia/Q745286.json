He took part in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797, the Battle of the Nile in August 1798 and the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. He served as flag captain to Admiral Lord Nelson, and commanded HMS Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. Nelson was shot as he paced the decks with Hardy, and as he lay dying, Nelson's famous remark of \"Kiss me, Hardy\" was directed at him. Hardy went on to become First Naval Lord in November 1830 and in that capacity refused to become a Member of Parliament and encouraged the introduction of steam warships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 5", "response": ["*1769 \u2013 Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet, English admiral (d. 1839)"]}, {"page": "September 20", "response": ["*1839 \u2013 Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet, English admiral (b. 1769)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Hardy (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet (1769\u20131839), British naval officer"]}, {"page": "Nelson's Hardy", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet"]}, {"page": "Kingston Russell House", "response": ["At some point possibly around the 1640s, part of the manor, including the house, came into the possession of the Michel family, who partly rebuilt the seventeenth century Kingston Russell House as it still stands today at the end of a long driveway.

That year, Shout's grandson decided to sell the medals to relieve some of the family debt and financial burdens. At the time Shout's VC was the only one awarded to a member of the AIF at Gallipoli that was not in the collection of the Australian War Memorial. The medals were auctioned by the Sydney firm Bonhams & Goodman on 24 July 2006, and realised a world record hammer price of AU$1 million. The sale surpassed, almost doubling, the previous auction records for a medal\u2014set by the Naval Gold Medal awarded to Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet\u2014and the price paid for a VC, previously held by that awarded to Norman Cyril Jackson. Shout's medals were purchased by media mogul Kerry Stokes, who subsequently donated the set to the Australian War Memorial for display in the Hall of Valour."]}]}}
