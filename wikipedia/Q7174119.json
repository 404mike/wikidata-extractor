He previously held the position of Executive Director at Grimsby Town where he was twice Chairman.\nGrimsby born Furneaux has owned shares in his home town club for over 20 years. He has been Chairman twice. In the early 1990s he was at the helm before selling out to Bill Carr. Furneaux became Chairman again in the late 1990s when he bought the majority stake hold from Doug Everitt, for an undisclosed sum.\nWhile Furneaux was at the helm the club enjoyed much success, with Furneaux guiding them from the then Fourth Division up to the second tier of English football. He has in many respects been the club's longest serving and most successful chairman until the collapse of ITV Digital when the club faced huge difficulties.\nIn 2004 Furneaux relinquished his position once again, with the club's majority shareholder John Fenty taking over.On 5 March 2011 it was announced that Furneaux would be stepping down from Grimsby's board of directors at the end of the 2010\u20132011 season amidst protests against himself and fellow directors Michael Chapman and John Elsom from supporters before the league tie with AFC Wimbledon. The fans had been unhappy with the trio who they had blamed for the resignation of vice-chairman Mike Parker earlier in the week. The news was broken to supporters when chairman John Fenty addressed them.Furneaux stood down with immediate effect on 9 March 2011.Furneaux died on 2 December 2014, aged 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["1987\u201388 saw Grimsby Town suffer a second consecutive relegation, placing them in the Fourth Division. The club's financial situation was also dismal, and as the 1988\u201389 season began, the task at Grimsby was to avoid relegation to the Football Conference, avoid expulsion from the FA and avoid going out of business completely. This was achieved, finishing 9th. Following the resignation of Dave Booth in 1986 (to pursue outside business interests) the club had two managers in two years (Mick Lyons and Bobby Roberts). Alan Buckley was appointed after the 1988 relegation and by 1991 had led the club to two successive promotions with the chairman at that time being Peter Furneaux. Grimsby were to remain in football's second flight for six years. Buckley's crop of players consisting of some of the most popular and biggest cult heroes in the club's history; players such as Shaun Cunnington, Keith Alexander, Mark Lever, Dave Gilbert, Steve Livingstone, Paul Futcher, Paul Groves and Clive Mendonca made the club a solid second-tier side (the Second Division became Division One in 1992 upon the creation of the Premier League from the old First Division). In 1992\u201393, Grimsby finished 9th in the new Division One, and until well into April they were in the hunt for a play-off place that would have given them the chance of a third promotion in four years. They dipped to 16th place a year later, though they were never in any real danger of relegation.", "|  Peter Furneaux", "|  Peter Furneaux"]}, {"page": "John Fenty", "response": ["Following the sale of Five Star Fish in April 2004, Fenty became chairman of Grimsby Town on 29 July 2004 with Peter Furneaux switching roles with Fenty and becoming Vice Chairman."]}, {"page": "Furneaux (surname)", "response": ["*Peter Furneaux (1935-2014), English football club chairman and investor"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Peter Furneaux, 79, football club chairman and investor (Grimsby Town)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2014", "response": ["*Peter Furneaux, 79, English football club chairman and investor (Grimsby Town).Former Grimsby Town chairman Peter Furneaux has died "]}, {"page": "Furneaux, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Furneaux"]}]}}
