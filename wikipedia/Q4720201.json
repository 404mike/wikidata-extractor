Previously, he was director and deputy chairman of the British company OGN Group. When in Russia, he held senior posts in the Russian Defence Ministry in the 1990s and, from 1999, was a senior executive and director at the Russian oil and gas company Yukos. He has resided in the United Kingdom since 2004. He became a British citizen in 2011.Temerko is a member and advocate of the UK Conservative Party. He has donated more than \u00a31.3 million to the party. He is also a member of the advisory council of right-wing think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs. In November 2019, he called for the publication of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament\u2032s report (\"The Russia report\") on Russian influence in British politics. In connection with the report, Temerko has denied he has ties with the Kremlin.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Human rights in Russia", "response": ["There has been a number of high-profile cases of human rights abuses connected to business in Russia.  Among other abuses, this most obviously involves abuse of article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These include the case of the former heads of the oil company Yukos, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and  Platon Lebedev whom  Amnesty International declared prisoners of conscience, and the case of the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, whose efforts to expose a conspiracy of criminals and corrupt law-enforcement officials earned him sustained abuse in prison which led to his death. An analogous case was the death in custody of the businesswoman Vera Trifonova, who was in jail for alleged fraud. Cases such as these have contributed to suspicion in other countries about the Russian justice system, which has manifested itself in the refusal to grant Russian extradition requests for businessmen fleeing abroad. Notable instances of this are the cases of the tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former Yukos vice president Alexander Temerko in the UK, the media magnate Vladimir Gusinsky in Spain and Greece, Leonid Nevzlin in Israel and Ivan Kolesnikov in Cyprus.  A case that will test the attitude of the French authorities to this issue is that of the shipping magnate Vitaly Arkhangelsky. The WikiLeaks revelations indicated the low level of confidence other governments have in the Russian government on such issues. Cases involving major companies may gain coverage in the world media, but there are many further cases equally worthy of attention: a typical case involves the expropriation of assets, with criminals and corrupt law-enforcement officials collaborating to bring false charges against businesspeople, who are told that they must hand over assets to avoid criminal proceedings against them.  A prominent campaigner against such abuses  is Yana Yakovleva, herself a victim who set up the group Business Solidarity in the aftermath of her ordeal."]}, {"page": "David Morris (Conservative politician)", "response": ["In September 2020, Morris was found guilty of breaching the rules on donations by the Parliamentary Standards Commission.
