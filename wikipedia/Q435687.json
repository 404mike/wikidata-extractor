She was initiated into the London coven of Alex Sanders (founder of the Alexandrian tradition of Wicca) at the age of eighteen, but later joined a Gardnerian coven in the famous Whitecroft line derived from Eleanor Bone, and so she was one of few people in the seventies to be part of both traditions.\nShe founded the Wicca Study Group in London in 1988, and became secretary of the Pagan Federation the same year. Vivianne Crowley was described as \"very influential in recent developments in Wicca...  She has more of less captained the bringing together of the Gardnerian and Alexandrian Traditions through the process of cross-initiation, where a person is initiated into both Traditions\". Professor Ronald Hutton also has described Vivianne as \"the closest thing that Britain possessed to an informal successor to Alex Sanders.As an interfaith coordinator for the Federation, she served as the U.K. coordinator of the Pagan Chaplainry Services for H.M. Prisons. In 1989, she released her first book Wicca: The Old Religion in the New Age, which is one of the most valued and widespread books on Wicca. It was revised and updated in 1996 as Wicca: The Old Religion in the New Millennium.\nCrowley is a Jungian psychologist who lectures on the psychology of religion at King's College London, University of London. She holds a bachelor's degree and Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of London.  She is also the adjunct professor at the Union Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wicca", "response": ["As well as pantheism and duotheism, many Wiccans accept the concept of polytheism, thereby believing that there are many different deities. Some accept the view espoused by the occultist Dion Fortune that \"all gods are one god, and all goddesses are one goddess\" \u2013 that is that the gods and goddesses of all cultures are, respectively, aspects of one supernal God and Goddess. With this mindset, a Wiccan may regard the Germanic \u0112ostre, Hindu Kali, and Catholic Virgin Mary each as manifestations of one supreme Goddess and likewise, the Celtic Cernunnos, the ancient Greek Dionysus and the Judeo-Christian Yahweh as aspects of a single, archetypal god. A more strictly polytheistic approach holds the various goddesses and gods to be separate and distinct entities in their own right. The Wiccan writers Janet Farrar and Gavin Bone have postulated that Wicca is becoming more polytheistic as it matures, tending to embrace a more traditionally pagan worldview. Some Wiccans conceive of deities not as literal personalities but as metaphorical archetypes or thoughtforms, thereby technically allowing them to be atheists. Such a view was purported by the High Priestess Vivianne Crowley, herself a psychologist, who considered the Wiccan deities to be Jungian archetypes that existed within the subconscious that could be evoked in ritual. It was for this reason, she said \"The Goddess and God manifest to us in dream and vision.\"", "In 1998, the Wiccan high priestess and academic psychologist Vivianne Crowley suggested that Wicca had been less successful in propagating in countries whose populations were primarily Roman Catholic. She suggested that this might be because Wicca's emphasis on a female divinity was more novel to people raised in Protestant-dominant backgrounds. On the basis of her experience, Pearson concurred that this was broadly true."]}, {"page": "Dion Fortune", "response": ["The religious studies scholar Hugh Urban noted that Fortune was \"one of the key links\" between early twentieth-century ceremonial magic and the developing Pagan religion of Wicca. Similarly, the Wiccan high priestess Vivianne Crowley characterised Fortune as a \"proto-Pagan\". The scholar and esotericist Nevill Drury stated that Fortune \"in many ways anticipated feminist ideas in contemporary Wicca\", particularly through her belief that all goddesses were a manifestation of a single Great Goddess. Graf agreed, adding that Fortune's works found \"resonance\" in the work of the later feminist Wiccan Starhawk, and in particular in the latter's 1979 book, The Spiral Dance."]}, {"page": "Ceremonial magic", "response": ["The religious studies scholar Hugh Urban noted that Fortune was \"one of the key links\" between early twentieth-century ceremonial magic and the developing Pagan religion of Wicca.

Author Vivianne Crowley often trains her students in both traditions. In the United States, Alexandrian priestess Mary Nesnick, an initiate of both traditions, created a deliberate fusion of the two, which she named the Algard Tradition."]}, {"page": "Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)", "response": ["Some neopagans believe that the Triple Goddess is an archetypal figure which appears in a number of different cultures throughout human history, and that many individual goddesses can be interpreted as Triple Goddesses, The wide acceptance of an archetype theory has led to neopagans adopting the images and names of culturally divergent deities for ritual purposes;Rountree, Kathryn (2004).

Several advocates of Wicca, such as Vivianne Crowley and Selena Fox, are practising psychologists or psychotherapists and looked specifically to the work of Carl Jung to develop the theory of the Goddess as an archetype.Morris, Brian (2006).
