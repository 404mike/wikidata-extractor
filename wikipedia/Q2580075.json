He also wrote critical and philosophical essays and reviews. His 1829 novel The Five Nights of St. Albans: A Romance of the Sixteenth Century received a good review from John Gibson Lockhart, an achievement which was considered a rare distinction. Mudford also published short fictional stories which were featured in periodicals such as Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Fraser's Magazine, and Bentley's Miscellany. His short story \"The Iron Shroud\", about an iron torture chamber which shrinks through mechanical action and eventually crushes the victim inside, was first published in August 1830 by Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, and later republished separately in 1839 and 1840 with the subtitle \"Italian Revenge\". Edgar Allan Poe is considered to have been influenced by \"The Iron Shroud\" when he wrote \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" having got his idea for the shrinking chamber from Mudford's story. Mudford was born in London, where his father made a living as a shopkeeper in Piccadilly. He was influenced by John Milton, Joseph Addison, Samuel Johnson, William Cowper, William Collins, Mark Akenside, Thomas Gray, and Oliver Goldsmith.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pit and the Pendulum", "response": ["Poe was following an established model of terror writing of his day, often seen in Blackwood's Magazine (a formula he mocks in \"A Predicament\"). Those stories, however, often focused on chance occurrences or personal vengeance as a source of terror. Poe may have been inspired to focus on the purposeful impersonal torture in part by Juan Antonio Llorente's History of the Spanish Inquisition, first published in 1817.Alterton, Margaret. \"An Additional Source for Poe's 'The Pit and the Pendulum'\" from Modern Language Notes, Vol. 48, No. 6 (Jun., 1933), p. 349 It has also been suggested that Poe's \"pit\" was inspired by a translation of the Qur'an (Poe had referenced the Qur'an also in \"Al Aaraaf\" and \"Israfel\") by George Sale. Poe was familiar with Sale, and even mentioned him by name in a note in his story \"The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade\". Sale's translation was a part of commentary and, in one of those notes, refers to an allegedly common form of torture and execution by \"throwing [people] into a glowing pit of fire, whence he had the opprobrious appellation of the Lord of the Pit.\" In the Koran itself, in Sura (Chapter) 85, \"The Celestial Signs\", a passage reads: \"...cursed were the contrivers of the pit, of fire supplied with the fuel... and they afflicted them for no other reason, but because they believed in the mighty, the glorious God.\"Murtuza, Athar. \"An Arabian Source for Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" from Poe Studies, vol.
