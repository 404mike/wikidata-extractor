Originally from Trinidad, Howe arrived in England as a teenager in 1961, intending to study law and settling in London. There he joined the British Black Panthers, a group named in sympathy with the  US Black Panther Party.He came to public attention in 1970 as one of the nine protestors, known as the Mangrove Nine, arrested and tried on charges that included conspiracy to incite a riot, following a protest against repeated police raids of The Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill, London. They were all acquitted of the most serious charges and the trial became the first judicial acknowledgement of behaviour (the repeated raids) motivated by racial hatred, rather than legitimate crime control, within the Metropolitan Police. In 1981, he organised a 20,000-strong \"Black People's Day of Action\" in protest at the handling of the investigation into the New Cross Fire, in which 13 black teenagers died.Howe was an editor of Race Today, and chairman of the Notting Hill Carnival. He was best known as a television broadcaster in the UK for his Black on Black series on Channel 4, his current affairs programme Devil's Advocate, and his work with Tariq Ali on Bandung File. His television work also included White Tribe (2000), a look at modern Britain and its loss of \"Englishness\"; Slave Nation (2001); Who You Callin' a Nigger? (2004); and Is This My Country? (2006), a search for his West Indian identity.

On 18 January 1981 a number of black youths died in a fire during a house party in New Cross, in the nearby Borough of Lewisham. Although authorities stated that the fire started inside and was accidental, the public believed it was an arson attack and criticised the police investigation as inadequate. Black activists, including Darcus Howe, organised a march for the \"Black People's Day of Action\" on 2 March. Accounts of turnout vary from 5,000 to 20,000 to 25,000. The marchers walked 17 miles from Deptford to Hyde Park, passing the Houses of Parliament and Fleet Street. While the majority of the march finished in Hyde Park without incident, there was some confrontation with police at Blackfriars. According to Professor Les Back, \"while the local press reported the march respectfully, the national papers unloaded the full weight of racial stereotyping.\" The Evening Standards front-page headline had displayed a photo of a policeman with a bloody face juxtaposed with Darcus Howe's quote about the march being \"A good day\".  A few weeks later, the police arrested some of the march organizers and charged them with the offence of riot, but were later acquitted."]}, {"page": "Adam Afriyie", "response": ["In May 2004, Adam and Romi Afriyie won a libel case against The Mail on Sunday over a published article, \"What IDS's Mr Perfect didn't tell Tory bosses\".
