He performed very well and contributed significantly to the opening goal and was praised by manager Colin Calderwood afterwards. He then hit a rich vein of form by helping Forest achieve an eight-game unbeaten run to put them into second spot in the league at Christmas 2007, including an influential display in the 3\u20130 win at Cheltenham Town. He finally got his first goal for the club, equalising just three minutes after coming off the bench in Forest's 2\u20131 victory over Huddersfield Town. Cohen was a virtual ever-present for Forest in his first season for the club, only missing the first five league games of the season, and helped the club gain automatic promotion to the Championship as League One runners-up."]}, {"page": "Arron", "response": ["*Arron Davies, Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "Southampton F.C.
