He went to Eton College prior to studying the engineering tripos at Cambridge University. He excelled there gaining a first class honours degree and claiming the prize in structural engineering. Staying at Cambridge as a fellow of Emmanuel College he completed his doctorate following work on soil deformation models. It was here that he met and married Elizabeth Gorham with whom he had three daughters and a son.Hambly left academia to spend five years working with Ove Arup and Partners in the design of structures and Gifford and Partners in bridge building. He devised new models and work methods for the approximation of structural behaviour which he published in 1976 in his first book, Bridge Deck Behaviour. In 1974 he set up his own consultancy and worked from his home in Hertfordshire, writing more than 40 technical papers to supplement his income. One of his first contracts was to investigate the design of bridge foundations for the Building Research Establishment, publishing some of his findings in Bridge Foundations and Substructures in 1979. He was asked by the oil and gas extraction industries to advise upon offshore platforms damaged by wave fatigue and collisions.His expertise in the industry was widely recognized and he was created a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1982, of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1984 and of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1991. He also served as chairman of the Offshore Engineering Society between 1989 and 1990.He worked as a visiting professor at Oxford University from 1989 to 1992 lecturing in structural analysis, he wrote his third book, Structural Analysis by Example (1994) to provide examples of calculations for students.\nHambly had a keen interest in the provision of better social housing and encouraging community spirit as well as a quaker upbringing, he united these beliefs in his service as a trustee to the Bournville Village Trust between 1979 and 1988.He was created a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1990 and was keen to use this to promote engineering to young people and society as a whole. He was elected vice-president in 1991 and President in 1994. He used his inaugural address to show the need to attract students into engineering degrees and to provide more sustainable solutions to engineering problems. However he died in London on 28 March 1995, just five months into his one-year presidency. A prize in his honour is awarded annually by the Institution of Civil Engineers for contributions to sustainability in the industry. He was posthumously awarded an honorary doctorate of science by Nottingham University in 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Institution of Civil Engineers", "response": ["; Edmund Hambly Medal : The Edmund Hambly Medal awarded for creative design in an engineering project that makes a substantial contribution to sustainable development.

As a result of this meeting, Sir Frederick Arthur Whitaker was elected to the position in February 1957 and was allowed to serve out the remainder of Gourley's term in addition to his own full term.

He was appointed to the presidency following the death in office of Edmund Hambly.  Ridley served out the remainder of Hambly's term as well as the usual 12 months in office, becoming the first person to do so since Herbert Manzoni in 1961. In June 1995 he called an extraordinary meeting of the ICE Council at its One Great George Street headquarters to discuss the future of the  loss-making New Civil Engineer magazine.  The ICE, facing a \u00a34 million overdraft from a renovation of the headquarters, and the slide of the magazine into unprofitability was considering selling the publishing arm. The council met in a closed session for the first time in its history, with the room being cleared of all observers and the secretariat leaving only the voting members.  The sale of New Civil Engineer and the institution's specialist engineering magazines to Emap was agreed later that month \u2013 though the ICE retained control of its book and journal publications."]}]}}
