He heads a gang dubbed The Hunt Syndicate, which has been described as being an extensive criminal empire that has so far evaded significant penetration from law enforcement. Hunt is known in gangland circles as Long Fella due to his height of 6 ft 5 inches. In a confidential police report from the early 2000s which was later leaked online, Hunt's gang was said to include family members and the father of a well known reality TV star.Hunt has been described by Metropolitan Police sources as being \"too big to bring down\". He became a close friend and associate of Reggie Kray, visiting him in prison in 2000 just prior to his death. He was the owner of \"Hunt's Waste Recycling\" in Dagenham, which during the nearby 2012 Olympics closing ceremony, was the centre of the \"largest fire in several years\" in London which saw 40 fire engines and over 200 fire fighters attend the scene. Now known as Connect Waste the recycling centre is run by Hunt's long time friend, Phil Mitchell.Hunt resides at The Morleys, a 7 bedroom mansion in Woodside Green, Great Hallingbury on the Essex/Hertfordshire border, close to Bishop's Stortford. Complete with swimming pool, tennis court, gym and guard dog pen, the mansion was purchased in September 1993 for \u00a3600,000. In 2013, it was revealed that Hunt had failed to declare any income or pay tax between 1982 and 1996, and he was unable to recall in court how he had been able to afford the property.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of gangsters by city", "response": ["*David Hunt (gangster) "]}, {"page": "List of British gangsters", "response": ["|David Hunt (gangster)"]}, {"page": "David Hunt", "response": ["* David Hunt (footballer, born 1982), English football defender (Oxford United)", "* David Hunt (footballer, born 1959), English football midfielder (Notts County)", "* David Hunt (footballer, born 1980), English football defender (Darlington)", "* David Hunt (racing driver) (1960\u20132015), English racing driver", "* David Hunt (sailor) (born 1934), English sailor", "* David Hunt (rower) (born 1991), South African rower", "* David Hunt (badminton) (born 1945), English badminton player", "* David Hunt (actor) (born 1953), English actor", "* David Hunt, Baron Hunt of Wirral (born 1942), British Conservative politician", "* David Hunt (botanist) (1938\u20132019), English botanist and taxonomist", "* David Hunt (diplomat) (1913\u20131998), Mastermind winner and former British ambassador to Brazil", "* David Hunt (gangster) (born 1961), English organised crime boss", "* David Hunt (judge) (1935\u20132019), Australian judge", "* David Hunt (ornithologist) (1934\u20131985), English ornithologist and birdwatcher", "* David Hunt (planter) (1779\u20131861), American plantation owner", "* David Hunt (video game streamer), known online as GrandPooBear, a video game streamer, speedrunner, and creator of Kaizo Mario levels"]}, {"page": "British firms (organised crime)", "response": ["London's crime families were traditionally centred in the East End of London (the infamous Kray twins being the most notable). Due to the restructuring of the East End, and the continued influx of migrants to the area, traditional Cockney families have moved to South London, parts of North London (mainly Islington), and the counties surrounding London (such as Essex and Kent). Working-class neighbourhoods are often still home to family-based crime groups involved in drug trafficking, extortion, prostitution, armed robbery, contract killing, money laundering, counterfeiting and kidnapping. Some of the more notorious South London crime families include the 'Brindles' and the 'Walkers', while the Arifs are the most notorious crime family from London's south-eastern neighbourhoods. The Hunt Crime Syndicate, otherwise known as the Canning Town Cartel, led by David Hunt (gangster) is one of the biggest London crime firms. Another well-known London crime family is the Clerkenwell crime syndicate in Islington, also known as the 'Adams family'.
