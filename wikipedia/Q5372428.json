The amalgamation was brokered by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) which did not itself wish to take up the plumage cause; as a moderate mainstream organisation, it was politic for it to keep some distance from what was seen as an extremist movement.Boase (2021) p.66.
