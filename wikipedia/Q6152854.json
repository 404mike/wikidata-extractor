She is best known for being part of the musical trio Rod, Jane and Freddy who appeared in many TV series, notably Rainbow. She was born into a family with an artistic background. Her grandmother was an opera singer, her mother Jean a pianist, and her father was Rex Tucker, the drama director for the BBC. Jane began to play the piano when she was three, being taught by her mother.\nTucker's first ambition was to follow in her mother's footsteps and become a concert pianist, but as a teenager she decided she would rather be an actress. This led her to study at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, where she continued her piano and singing whilst embarking on a full-time drama course.\nAfter graduating she worked in repertory theatre, touring, TV, and radio, during which she met and eventually married Rod Burton and, together with him and Freddy Marks, formed the long-lasting musical trio Rod, Jane and Freddy. Burton and Tucker divorced in 1979, following which she went on to marry Marks; Tucker remained married to Marks until his death in 2021.In 1967, Tucker was a hostess on the Associated-Rediffusion game show Exit!
