(1967\u2013present)", "response": ["He was replaced by his assistant Roy McFarland (who became the only man to manage the club permanently in two separate spells) who steered the club's to a second playoff campaign. After overcoming Millwall 5\u20131 on aggregate in the semifinal legs, and surviving a pitch invasion in the 3\u20131 win at the New Den, Derby came up against local rivals Leicester City at Wembley. Despite taking the lead through Tommy Johnson, Derby lost 2\u20131 after a double from Steve Walsh and missed out on promotion yet again. Derby had built a side which seemed to be consistently achieving less than the sum of its parts, with Gary Charles, a former England international, Craig Short, Paul Williams, Mark Pembridge, Paul Kitson and Tommy Johnson all keen to test themselves at a higher level. Several of these players left during the 1994\u201395 season, Kitson joining Newcastle United for \u00a32.25m, Charles and Johnson moving to Aston Villa for a combined \u00a32.9m and Pembridge moving to Sheffield Wednesday. The side was also weakened when goalkeeper Martin Taylor, an ever-present the previous season and touted for a place in the England squad, broke his leg in a 1\u20130 defeat at Southend United and was out of action for the next 29 months. With chairman Lionel Pickering's increased frustration at no return on his investment, the purse strings were tightened and McFarland was unable to buy suitable replacements, instead blooding youth products such as Dean Sturridge, Russell Hoult and Lee Carsley to fill the gaps created by the departures. In the event Derby could only record a 9th-place finish and McFarland, in the knowledge his contract was not going to be renewed, said his goodbye's in the penultimate match of the season, a 2\u20131 home defeat at Southend United, ending a 28-year association with the club, broken only by a two-year spell as player-manager at Bradford City.", "A host of names were linked with the Baseball Ground managerial spot \u2013 including Martin O'Neill, Steve Coppell, Ossie Ardiles and Neil Warnock. Steve Bruce rejected the chance to be player-manager before the club finally selected Jim Smith. out of a final two of Smith and Brian Horton. Smith, who appointed former Derby player Steve McClaren as his number two, joined a club with 15 out of contract players on high wages and players such as Craig Short, Mark Pembridge and Paul Williams intent on leaving. Smith sold them all, to Everton, Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City respectively, raising \u00a34.5m in the process. With promise that any money raised in player sales would be given to him for purchases, Smith began restructuring his squad with the signing of Robin Van Der Laan (\u00a3475,000 and Lee Mills) from Port Vale, Sean Flynn (a \u00a3250,000 makeweight in the Paul Williams deal), Gary Rowett (another makeweight, this time in exchange for Craig Short), Darryl Powell for \u00a3750,000 from Portsmouth and Ron Willems for \u00a3280,000 from Swiss champions Grasshopper Z\u00fcrich. Smith's eye for capturing players such as Rowett and Flynn in part exchange deals, as well as the fact that most of Cox's big money buys had held a large percentage of their value, meant that his transfer dealings did not hit the red until the signing of Ashley Ward for \u00a31m from Norwich City in March 1996. Employing his new signings alongside incumbent players such as Dean Sturridge and Russell Hoult, as well as McFarland's last major signing, Notts County defender Dean Yates (who was Player of the Season), Smith started the 1995\u201396 season poorly, with just 4 wins from their opening 14 games, but the influential signing of Igor Stimac for \u00a31.57m from Hajduk Split proved the key. Although Stimac's debut ended in a heavy defeat, 5\u20131 to Tranmere Rovers with Stimac scoring, Smith's jigsaw was complete and Derby's season turned on its head. The club embarked on a 20 match unbeaten league run from 11 November 1995 to 5 March 1996, the club's best run inside of one season. In this sequence the club won 13 of its fixtures, scoring three or more goals on 8 occasions and recorded a 4\u20131 win at Birmingham City, their first win at St. Andrews since 1948, and catapulted themselves from the bottom five to the top of the table in the space of four months, at one point finding themselves 7 points clear at the top of the table. The run ended with a 0\u20133 defeat by title rivals Sunderland at Roker Park but the club recovered to take 12 points from their next 8 fixtures, including revenge on Tranmere with a 6\u20132 win at The Baseball Ground. They went into the last home game of the season against 3rd placed Crystal Palace knowing victory would guarantee promotion. After a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Leicester City on 10 September 1995, Derby had been unbeaten in the league at home, winning 13 \u2013 including 8 consecutively \u2013 and drawing 6, and Dean Sturridge, who finished the season as the club's top scorer with 20 goals, and Robin Van Der Laan ensured the club won 2\u20131 to secure 2nd place and a return to the top flight, and a first season in the Premier League, after a five-year absence. Smith became the first man to earn promotion at the first attempt in the club's history and had managed it with very little outlay, using his knowledge and experience to shape an attacking outfit which played football the right way.", "Smith prepared for Derby's first tilt at the Premiership with the signing of two players who had competed at that year's European Championship finals in Denmark defender Jacob Laursen and Croatia midfielder Aljo\u0161a Asanovi\u0107. After starting the season with a 3\u20133 draw with old rivals Leeds United, Derby lost only one of their opening seven fixtures, recording a creditable 1\u20131 home draw with Champions Manchester United as well as a 2\u20131 win at Blackburn Rovers and a 1\u20130 win over Sunderland. However, a 0\u20132 defeat at home to Wimbledon (Derby's first home defeat in 23 league fixtures, equalling the club record set 67 years previously) showed a need for more experience and the inspired capture of Paul McGrath proved a key capture. A return of 10 points from a possible 12 in November saw the club peak at 9th in the league and showed that the club had the ability and wherewithal to stay in the Premiership although a crippling injury list contributed to a ten match winless streak mid-season which made sure safety was never a foregone conclusion, Derby finished the season in 12th, 6 points clear of relegation. Some memorable results occurred along the way, including a 2\u20132 draw away to Arsenal, a 4\u20132 victory over Tottenham Hotspur and a remarkable 3\u20132 victory against Manchester United, in which Mart Poom and Paulo Wanchope made their Derby debuts, Wanchope scoring a goal which was later voted the greatest in the club's history. An extended FA Cup saw The Baseball Ground hold its final three FA Cup fixtures ending with a 0\u20132 defeat by Middlesbrough in the quarter finals before The Baseball Ground held its final ever match, against Arsenal, on 11 May 1996. In front of a sellout 18,287 crowd, the largest of the season, the match was preceded by a minutes silence as fans reflected on the memories of Derby's 102 years at the old stadium. In the event of the match Ashley Ward, who finished the season with 9 goals, 2 behind leading scorer Dean Sturridge. opened the scoring in the opening ten minutes before Arsenal took over to win 3\u20131 with Ian Wright grabbing the last ever first team goal at the ground in the 90th minute.  The first two seasons at The Pride Park Stadium were the peak of Jim Smith's time at Derby County. With established stars such as Stimac, Wanchope and Poom added to with the captures of Stefano Eranio and Francesco Baiano, Derby became renowned for their \"rare mix of style and guile\", more intent on attacking than defending. Smith's cosmopolitan side, built as he felt there was \"very little market for British players\" in the increasingly import soaked Premiership, recorded two consecutive top ten finishes in the 1997\u201398 (9th) and 1998\u201399 (8th) Premier League seasons, the first time the club had achieved this since Dave MacKay in the mid-1970s and flirted with qualification for Europe on both occasions. Pride Park was something of a fortress in its first six months as, after the abandonment of its first game against Wimbledon due to floodlight failure, Stefano Eranio's penalty in a 1\u20130 win over Barnsley kicked off a 12 match unbeaten start at the stadium, which included a 3\u20130 win over Arsenal and a 4\u20130 victory against Southampton. The Barnsley match had attracted a crowd of 27,232 (the club's biggest home attendance since 27, 783 watched a 3\u20131 home defeat against Manchester United in February 1980) and it broke 30,000 for the first time since a 2\u20131 home defeat against Nottingham Forest in 1979, in a 2\u20132 draw against Manchester United on 18 October 1997. Derby started the 1997\u201398 at a fine pace, peaking at 4th following the 4\u20130 win over Southampton, and Francesco Baiano, Player of the Season, flourished in particular; equalling the club record of scoring in six consecutive league games. One of these matches, a 5\u20132 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in which Baiano scored twice, was the club's first victory at Hillsborough since September 1936. However, Aston Villa's 1\u20130 win at Pride Park on 7 February 1997, the first home league defeat at the ground, saw the team lose their way somewhat and Europe was missed out on, with only 16 points taken from the final 36 available. A second tilt at European football was made in the 1998\u201399 season, the Rams peaking in 2nd place after 6 games with a 2\u20130 home win over Leicester City, eventually finishing one place better off in 8th. They reached the FA Cup Quarter finals for the third time in seven years, losing out only to late Nwankwo Kanu goal in a 0\u20131 away defeat by Arsenal, and recorded some memorable victories, including a league double over Liverpool 2\u20131 at Anfield and 3\u20132 at Pride Park and a 1\u20130 win over Nottingham Forest in the teams' first ever meeting at Pride Park. Derby County were a club on the up; Pride Park's capacity was expanded (32,913 fans attended the 3\u20132 victory over Liverpool) and Derby's players were getting noticed \u2013 five had represented their countries at the 1998 World Cup, and Christian Dailly was sold to Blackburn Rovers for \u00a35.35m, comfortably the highest fee Derby had ever received. The key departure, however, was Steve McClaren \u2013 Smith's number two since he had taken the Derby managerial position 3 years earlier \u2013 who departed in February 1999 to become Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United, winning the treble in his first 3 months at Old Trafford. The 1998\u201399 season was Jim Smith's Derby County peak, as the financial demands of Premier League football began to catch up with them."]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["Arsenal's first fixture of November was against Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium.

When Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November, they needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders.

Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a second, leaving goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: \"This result is good for the English game because it will stimulate interest in the Premier League\" and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: \"A one-horse race is not good for the game.\" Arsenal failed to capitalise on the result, losing to Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool in a period where the team were depleted due to injuries."]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 December 2003 ||  Dean Sturridge ||align=\"center\"| Sheffield United ||align=\"center\"| 8 February 2004"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["Back in the top flight after a five-year exile, Jim Smith's Derby County side never looked in any real danger of an immediate return to Division One, and their 12th-place finish in the final table was their highest final position in eight years.
