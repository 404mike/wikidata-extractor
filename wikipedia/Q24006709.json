The painter, and later founder of the Royal Academy of Arts, Joshua Reynolds, was highly critical of Hogarth's style and work. According to art historian David Bindman, in Dr Johnson's serial of essays for London's Universal Chronicle, The Idler, the three essays written by Reynolds for the months of September through November 1759 are directed at Hogarth. In them, Reynolds argues that this \"connoisseur\" has a \"servile attention to minute exactness\" and questions their idea of the imitation of nature as \"the obvious sense, that objects are represented naturally when they have such relief that they seem real.\" Reynolds rejected \"this kind of imitation\", favouring the \"grand style of painting\" which avoids \"minute attention\" to the visible world. In Reynolds' Discourse XIV, he grants Hogarth has \"extraordinary talents\", but reproaches him for \"very imprudently, or rather presumptuously, attempt[ing] the great historical style.\"", "* David Bindman, Hogarth (London 1981).", "* David Bindman, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Og\u00e9e and Peter Wagner, eds.

Whether he had devised his method for relief etching at the time of composition is unknown, although he did make twelve drawings which were apparently to be included with the poem in some shape or form. Peter Ackroyd suggests that the illustrations, \"conceived in the heroic style,\" were inspired by the work of James Barry and George Romney, both of whom Blake admired and were intended for illustration rather than illumination. Most scholars agree with this theory (i.e. the images wouldn't be combined with the text, they would simply accompany the text) and it has been suggested that Blake abandoned the project when he discovered the technique to realise his desire for full integration of text and image. His first relief etching was The Approach of Doom (1788), and his first successful combination of words and pictures were All Religions are One and There is No Natural Religion (both 1788), but they were experiments only.Damon (1988: 16) His first 'real' illuminated book was The Book of Thel (1789) and it is possible that he abandoned Tiriel to work on Thel after making his breakthrough with All Religions and Natural Religion. According to David Bindman, for example, \"Tiriel's clear separation of text and design is transitional in being an example of the conventional method of combining text with design implicitly rejected by Blake in developing the method of illuminated printing. He probably abandoned the series because his new technique took him beyond what had now become for him an obsolete method.\"Bindman (2003: 90)"]}, {"page": "CIMP", "response": ["*David Bindman"]}, {"page": "All Religions are One", "response": ["Blake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate's edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press.The exact method is described in great detail in Joseph Viscomi, Blake and the Idea of the Book (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), chapters 4 and 18 This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio.See Bindman (1978), Bindman (2000) and Viscomi (2003) for more specific information. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse.Viscomi (2003: 43) Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.", "Until 1971, most editors tended to consider All Religions are One as later than There is No Natural Religion.

Keynes also assigned the three plates from 1794 which were reprinted in 1795 to Series b, designating them b3, b4 and b12. As such, Series b comprises eleven plates, with at least one plate missing (Plate b5; III). In 1978, David Bindman suggested that there are more plates missing from Series b than just Plate 5, as he argued that the last three plates (Application, Conclusion and 'Therefore') are thematically isolated, suggesting more missing plates which should come after Plate b8 (VII).Bindman (1978: 468) Bindman also saw the missing title page from Series a as important, arguing that although Series a was printed with the same title plate as Series b, there is no direct evidence that There is No Natural Religion is actually the correct title of Series a; \"There is No Natural Religion would seem to be the title of Series b, and its content would be compatible with such a title; but there would then be no reason why Series a should have the same title.\"", "Keynes' editorial decisions have been supported by most scholars since 1971, and editors of Blake's collected work in particular tend to adhere to the division into two distinct series'; for example, Alicia Ostriker's William Blake: The Complete Poems (1977), David Bindman's The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake (1978), David V.

The image of the child reaching for the bird is similar to the picture on Plate a8 (V), and as such may represent the concept of \"Desires\" as introduced on that plate. If this is so, the image here could represent the struggle between physical limits (represented by the restraining mother) and the desires which necessarily transcend those limits (as explained in Series b).

The man measuring the triangle refers to the concept of \"the Ratio\" as mentioned in the text. \"Ratio\" is from the Latin for \"Reason\" (\"Rationis\"), and for Harold Bloom, \"Ratio, in Blake's use, means an abstract image or ghost of an object, which in the aggregate makes up the universe of death which is the natural experience of most men.\"Harold Bloom, \"Commentary\" in Erdman (1982: 894) Similarly, for Peter Otto, the plate depicts Nebuchadnezzar II as \"Locke's Reason, closed within the 'Closet' of the mind while the triangle is one of the simple ideas that in Locke\u2019s system provide the primary building blocks of knowledge.\"Otto (2006: 264) For Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, the plate depicts enslavement to \"abstract reason and bondage to material nature. The latter is emphasised by the barren tree and other vegetation that curve over the figure as though to entrap him.\" Essick sees the illustration as visual pun; the literal application of Reason to the earth (represented by the ground) itself.Bindman (1974: 32) David Bindman speculates that Blake may have been inspired in this image by an engraving he had done in 1782 after a Thomas Stothard design for the frontispiece of An Introduction to Mensuration by John Bonnycastle, which depicts a young child measuring some triangles.Bindman (1978: 467) Eaves, Essick and Viscomi suggest Blake may have been building on Raphael's depiction of Euclid in The School of Athens (1511). Blake himself would use this image as the basis for two of his later planographic prints, Nebuchadnezzar (where he mirrors the posture) and Newton (where he mirrors the action; both c.1795/1805).  ", "David Bindman summarises There is No Natural Religion as \"an early and fundamental statement of [Blake's] philosophical beliefs, expressed in the rational language of 18th-century philosophers.\" In line with this way of thinking, S.
