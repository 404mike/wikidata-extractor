Principal photography began in February 2016 in London, and continued in May 2016 in the Canary Islands, used to stand in for Morocco. Joanna Johnston designed the film's costumes, matching them to the characters' mindsets and situations.", "Designer and frequent Zemeckis collaborator Joanna Johnston provided the costume design on the film, and was given free rein by Zemeckis on the designs. Due to the quick process of the pre-production, little more than two weeks were available to Johnston for research. She described in an interview that she sought to give the costumes a polished, glossy look. For influence, Johnston paid visits to the Imperial War Museum in London, a practice she had also done when working on other war set films such as Saving Private Ryan, Valkyrie and War Horse; looked at the wardrobes of Golden Age actresses Lauren Bacall, Barbara Stanwyck and Katharine Hepburn, as well as the wardrobes utilized in the films Casablanca and Now, Voyager. Johnston shaped the style of the costumes around the characters, and particular focus was on Marianne, whose clothing altered with the development of the plot. \"I wanted her to look very assured in the first part of the film, in Casablanca.\", said Johnston, \"I looked at a lot of French style and fashion plates from the time, and I made her look very clean and graphic. When she goes to London, she takes on a mantle of being a mother and wife, so I put her in warmer tones. But you never really know who she is.\"", "Stephanie Zacharek of Time stated that \"Even within this highly synthetic world, Pitt and Cotillard give sturdy, coded performances that feel naturalistic, not phony: They understand clearly that their chief mission is to tap the tradition of melodrama, and they take it seriously. Somehow, almost incomprehensibly, it all works. Allied looks old but smells new, and the scent is heady.\" Eric Eisenberg from CinemaBlend gave the film four out of five, praising the performances of Pitt and Cotillard and stating they \"prove again why they're two of the best in the business.\" Rex Reed from The New York Observer gave the film four out of four, writing: \"Beautiful, bold and blazing with sex and suspense, Allied is a gorgeously photographed, intensely romantic, action-packed film by the great director Robert Zemeckis with two titanic star performances by Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard that delivers something for everyone.\" At Deadline Hollywood, Pete Hammond, in addition to praising the performances, screenplay and direction, gave praise to Alan Silvestri's score, citing it as one of his best works. For RogerEbert.com, Peter Sobcynzki gave the film 4 stars, highlighting the music from Alan Silvestri, the cinematography from Don Burgess and the costume design from Joanna Johnston. In his summary he wrote, \"It is a lovely homage to the kind of entertainment that Hollywood used to put out in the day without breaking a sweat, while still strong and sure enough to work on viewers who have never seen any of the films to which it pays tribute.\"", "|rowspan=3| Joanna Johnston"]}, {"page": "22nd Critics' Choice Awards", "response": ["* Joanna Johnston \u2013 Allied"]}, {"page": "Costume Designers Guild Award for Excellence in Period Film", "response": ["| Lincoln || Joanna Johnston "]}, {"page": "Costume Designers Guild Award for Excellence in Contemporary Film", "response": ["| About a Boy || Joanna Johnston"]}, {"page": "43rd Saturn Awards", "response": ["* The BFG \u2013 Joanna Johnston"]}, {"page": "Spielberg (film)", "response": ["*Joanna Johnston"]}, {"page": "Costume Designers Guild Awards 2017", "response": ["*Joanna Johnston"]}, {"page": "List of female Academy Award winners and nominees for non-gendered categories", "response": ["|Joanna Johnston", "|Joanna Johnston"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2017", "response": ["* Joanna Johnston (Best Costume Design) \u2013 Allied", "* Joanna Johnston (Best Costume Design) \u2013 Allied"]}]}}
