According to the Book of Moses, the Devil offered to be the redeemer of mankind for the sake of his own glory. Conversely, Jesus offered to be the redeemer of mankind so that his father's will would be done. After his offer was rejected, Satan became rebellious and was subsequently cast out of heaven. In the Book of Moses, Cain is said to have \"loved Satan more than God\" and conspired with Satan to kill Abel. It was through this pact that Cain became a Master Mahan. The Book of Moses also says that Moses was tempted by Satan before calling upon the name of the \"Only Begotten\", which caused Satan to depart. Douglas Davies asserts that this text \"reflects\" the temptation of Jesus in the Bible."]}, {"page": "St John's College, Durham", "response": ["File:Douglas Davies.jpg|Douglas Davies, academic", "* Douglas Davies, theologian"]}, {"page": "Hatfield College, Durham", "response": ["As of 2018, other staff affiliated to the college include eight junior research fellows and 10 Senior Research Fellows.
