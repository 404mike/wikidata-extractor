This did not come to pass, but a similar event was created in Germany in 1909 in the form of the Academic Olympia. Five editions were held from 1909 to 1913, all of which were hosted in Germany following the cancellation of an Italy-based event.Bell, Daniel (2003). Encyclopedia of International Games.

Chaired by Hodgson Pratt, it agreed to establish the \"Women's Protective and Provident League\", not as a trade union federation, but as an organisation which promoted women's trade unionism.  Initially, it had four objects: protecting wages and conditions of workers, providing benefits for sick and unemployed workers, serving as an employment bureau, and promoting arbitration in the case of disputes between workers and employers.  An executive committee was also elected.  Paterson still wanted to form a trade union for women, and this occurred later in the year, when she set up the National Association of Working Women."]}, {"page": "Lytham Library", "response": ["At the opening ceremony a Mr Hodgson Pratt was present, presumably the same man who was a member of the council of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union and founder of the International Arbitration and Peace Association. He also spoke to the gathering and, in reference to the Reform Bills, commented that, 'With every fresh extension of the suffrage it became their duty to see that the people were educated and qualified for the new and great responsibilities rested in them. There was an immense amount of political ignorance in the country, and he would advise working men to read carefully and thoroughly political history'.Supplement to the Lytham and Kirkham Times; St Anne's-on-the-Sea Gazette; and Lancashire Advertiser, 4 Sept Jan 1878, p.1 col. d It would be 1918 before women over 30 were given the vote and another 10 years that before there were equal voting rights. At the time of the opening of the Lytham Institute, it would be a place that men could educate themselves for their new role in the democratic system."]}]}}
