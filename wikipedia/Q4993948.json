He was also responsible for the 1st Airborne Division, under Major-General George Hopkinson, which would be dropped by parachute and glider just prior to the amphibious landings. The landings on Sicily on 10 July 1943 initially went well, with XIII Corps achieving all its first day objectives, but by 12 July progress slowed after the 5th Division encountered elements of the German Hermann G\u00f6ring Division. Montgomery and Dempsey attempted to capture Catania using paratroops and commandos. This was only partially successful, and Catania was not taken. Dempsey suggested an amphibious operation, but this was rejected by Montgomery in favour of switching the main axis of the Eighth Army's advance inland to XXX Corps to the west of Mount Etna. On 3 August Dempsey relieved Berney-Ficklin of his command. His performance had impressed neither Dempsey nor Montgomery, and the latter was happy to replace him with another prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Gerard Bucknall."]}, {"page": "Currie (surname)", "response": ["* John Cecil Currie (1898\u20131944), British World War Two Army officer"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (J)", "response": ["# John Cecil Currie"]}, {"page": "John Currie", "response": ["*John Cecil Currie (1898\u20131944), British Army officer during World War II"]}, {"page": "Dirnanean House", "response": ["* Brigadier John Cecil Currie , British Army Officer during WWII"]}, {"page": "James Macgregor (MP)", "response": ["A grandson was John Cecil Currie  (1898 \u2013 26 June 1944)."]}]}}
