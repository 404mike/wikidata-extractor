In preparation for 1997\u201398, Still primarily signed players he had worked with at Peterborough, including Ken Charlery, Greg Heald, Billy Manuel, and Scott McGleish. In his first season in charge, Still took Barnet to the Third Division play-offs, but lost 3\u20132 in the semi-final to Colchester United.

Still led Barnet to the play-offs once again in 1999\u20132000, under the threat of the club being expelled from the division due to problems surrounding their home ground, Underhill.

Injury to Terry Evans saw Bates finally take over one of the centre back positions in the newly renamed First Division during the 1992\u201393 season, though the campaign ended with the league relegated back to the Second Division. Under new manager David Webb, Bates was paired at centre back with Shane Westley during the 1993\u201394 season and took over the captaincy from Billy Manuel."]}]}}
