However, Johnson hit back completing the signings of James Dayton, Sidney Schmeltz and Korey Smith. The latter chose to make his initial loan into a permanent deal with Johnson also appointing the player as the new team captain. Oldham started the season as Johnson intended, winning 4\u20133 at Stevenage. Such form continued throughout the season, with Oldham playing high quality football, receiving plaudits from opposition managers and pundits alike. In January various changes were made, notably losing the services of James Tarkowksi to Brentford for an undisclosed fee. Johnson made signings that would go on to make a big impact to Oldham's second half of the season, most notably the loan of Gary Harkins from St. Mirren. After various excellent performances throughout the first half of the season, Johnson was rewarded with a renewed contract, extending it until the summer of 2018, stating, \"I love the club, the new contract extension makes me feel valued by the owner and the board. I know I will get it right and that I will be given time to do that, at what is a fantastic club\". As their season came to a close, the Latics ended the season on a 10-game unbeaten run, which saw the club finish fifteenth, two points short of the top\u2013half of the table, making this the club's best finish for the side since the end of the 2008\u201309 season under John Sheridan."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Norwich City F.C. season", "response": ["January proved to be a pivotal month for Norwich and they started it with a 1\u20130 win away at Wycombe. Although the Canaries dominated the game they failed to make the breakthrough. But Korey Smith struck a goal in the last 20 minutes of the game to send Norwich into second place. After this Norwich never looked back and followed this up with a 3\u20131 win at home to Exeter. Next up was probably one of Norwich's biggest game of the season at Colchester away. After the 7\u20131 defeat on the opening day of the season and Paul Lambert's departure the game was much anticipated. But it was Norwich who gained the ultimate revenge by winning 5\u20130 on an extremely waterlogged pitch. A Chris Martin double put City 2\u20130 up at half time before Gary Doherty, Grant Holt and Oli Johnson made it 5\u20130 and Wes Hoolahan even missed a penalty! Norwich had now also closed the gap on top of the league Leeds and due to their cup commitments City could go top with a win over Brentford. The task was made more difficult after Grant Holt's sending off but they won 1\u20130 thanks to a Chris Martin goal. Norwich were above Leeds on goal difference but Leeds had two games in hand. Norwich got a hard-fought 2\u20131 away win at Walsall with two late goals from Chris Martin and Cody Mcdonald and with Leeds losing it extended City's lead at the top to three points. City ended the month with a 2\u20131 win over Hartlepool meaning they had won 6 games out of 6 in January."]}, {"page": "Korey", "response": ["*Korey Smith (born 1991), English professional footballer who plays for Bristol City"]}, {"page": "Liam Kelly (footballer, born 1990)", "response": ["Kelly signed a three-year contract with Oldham Athletic on 27 June 2014 as part of the exchange to Korey Smith.

The performance of centre back Richard Hinds saw him named in the Football League One Team of the Week for the second time in three weeks. The Football League Trophy match against Bristol Rovers saw a sluggish performance from Yeovil but despite a red card for captain Jamie McAllister, for an off the ball incident with former team-mate David Clarkson, Yeovil won 3\u20130 with two goals from free-kicks from Ed Upson and a first goal for Sam Foley proving the difference. The club also received a team performance of the round award for their victory over Bristol Rovers. On 8 September, on Soccer AM, Yeovil were drawn away against Torquay United in the second round of the Football League Trophy, later in the day saw a tired performance in the club's first league defeat 1\u20130 at home against Bournemouth. On 15 September, Norwich City midfielder Korey Smith joined Yeovil on an emergency loan deal for the maximum period of 93 days, he made his debut as a substitute that afternoon in the 1\u20130 away defeat against MK Dons as Yeovil slipped to a second consecutive defeat. The following Tuesday saw Yeovil travel to play Leyton Orient and with a frail defensive display Yeovil suffered a heavy 4\u20131 defeat, with the only positive a first league goal for Sam Foley and slipped to 11th in the table. On 21 September, versatile full\u2013back Joe Edwards, who had a loan spell with the club last season, resigned from Bristol City on loan. Yeovil's dismal form continued with another home defeat this time a 1\u20130 reverse against Sheffield United, on 22 September. On 25 September, Rohan Ince returned to Chelsea following an unsuccessful loan spell, but signed 6\u00a0ft 6in defender Dan Burn from Fulham on a youth loan deal for an initial month . Despite taking a sixth minute lead through a Gavin Williams penalty against Preston North End more poor defending and the sending off of midfielder Ed Upson led to a second half turnaround and a 3\u20132 defeat, with debutante Dan Burn scoring at both ends. This defeat saw Yeovil finish the month of September setting a new unwanted club record in the Football League for most consecutive defeats.", "Yeovil's dismal run of form continued into October, and despite a Reuben Reid penalty the club suffered a 2\u20131 home defeat against Portsmouth, their sixth consecutive defeat as the club slid to 16th in the League One table. The game proved more costly for Yeovil than merely a defeat with injuries to both Lewis Young, ankle ligament damage and Gozie Ugwu, recurrence of a hamstring injury, ruling them both out for the month of October, in an attempt to arrest this run of form and as cover for those injuries, on 4 October, Gary Johnson completed the loan signing of Republic of Ireland U21 striker Paddy Madden from Carlisle United. The move worked with immediate effect with Madden scoring a brace on his debut and Hayter adding a third in a 3\u20131 victory over Colchester United. The poor run of form though was reflected by the Colchester United match being the club's lowest ever Football League attendance of just 3,002. This improved performance led to a double nomination in the Football League's Team of the Week with Irish duo Madden and winger Sam Foley both represented. On 9 October, Yeovil's away Football League Trophy tie against Torquay United was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Plainmoor, with the match rescheduled for the following week on the following Saturday the winner of the tie was given the reward of a home Area Quarter-final tie against Wycombe Wanderers in the next round. Another encouraging performance away at league leaders Tranmere Rovers saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead after half an hour thanks to goals from Madden and Foley, but another second half collapse saw Tranmere comeback to win the game 3\u20132 with Yeovil's plight not aided by having Joe Edwards sent off for two yellow cards. In their rearranged tie on 16 October, Yeovil salvaged a 2\u20132 draw against Torquay United with a stoppage time equaliser from James Hayter, to add to his earlier goal, with Yeovil winning the tie 5\u20134 on penalties, having scored all five of their spot kicks and keeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch having saved Torquay's Thomas Cruise's effort. The victory confirming Yeovil's progress to the Area Quarter-final stage of the Football League Trophy, for the first time in five years, with a home tie against Wycombe Wanderers. An unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over a ten-man Bury followed courtesy of goals from Byron Webster and Foley, the performance of midfielder Korey Smith earned him recognition in the League One Team of the Week. That weekend in the draw for the FA Cup First Round Proper Yeovil were given an away tie against fellow League One side Preston North End, to be played on 3 November. On 23 October, with injuries continuing to hamper the squad young Jamaican-born midfielder Daniel Johnson joined the club on a month-long youth loan deal from Aston Villa. That evening Yeovil strolled to a 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden and a goal from top scorer Hayter who took his tally for the season to seven, Daniel Johnson made his debut as a second-half substitute but had the ignominy of giving away a penalty. Yeovil ended the month with a third consecutive victory this time a 1\u20130 away win against Crewe Alexandra thanks to a second goal in a week for defender Byron Webster, the result was also only Yeovil's second clean sheet in the League that season. After a two-month loan spell at AFC Wimbledon, defender Curtis Haynes-Brown returned to the club having made six appearances for the Dons. Webster's winning goal and the club's second league clean sheet of the season led to his inclusion in the Football League's Team of the Week.", "Yeovil began the month with a home Football League Trophy tie against Football League Two side Wycombe Wanderers, courtesy of first-half goals from midfielders Ed Upson and Sam Foley Yeovil recorded a comfortable 2\u20130 victory. The victory meant that Yeovil had qualified for the Southern Area Semi-finals the furthest they had ever reached in the competition, in the draw for this match on 8 December Yeovil were drawn away against League One rivals Leyton Orient. The same day Yeovil faced Notts County at home and despite multiple chances and saves forced from visiting keeper Bartosz Bia\u0142kowski were forced to be content with a 0\u20130 draw. Manager Gary Johnson announced after the match that Watford defender Dale Bennett had returned to his parent club a month early after just one substitute appearance due to a back injury. On 15 December, Yeovil faced an away game against Walsall and recovered from 2\u20130 down to draw thanks to a goal from substitute Reuben Reid and a last minute equaliser from Sam Foley. For the Football League Trophy tie with Leyton Orient in January the club offer fans free transport to the match in an attempt to get 500 away travelling supporters, with these coaches funded by the chairman John Fry, joint owner Norman Hayward, directors, vice-presidents, manager Gary Johnson and the playing squad. On 22 December, despite conceding the opening goal in only the third minute against Oldham Athletic the team turned the game around thanks to two goals from Gavin Williams, the second a superb 30-yard strike, and two late goals from Hayter and Madden seeing Yeovil to a 4\u20131 victory their largest home victory of the season. Yeovil's Boxing Day fixture saw them face a short trip to Bournemouth without Foley with a hamstring injury and Korey Smith and Joe Edwards both of whom had returned to their parent clubs due to their loan spells having been completed, a stretched squad suffered a 3\u20130 reverse. Following the game Johnson confirmed that the January transfer window would see an overhaul of the squad with the hope of helping Yeovil move up the table in the second half of the season, Johnson confirmed two of these signing would be likely to be the permanent acquisition of Paddy Madden and the signing of Irish trialist Kevin Dawson. On 29 December, Yeovil visited Fratton Park for the first time in their history to take on Portsmouth the Glovers won the game 2\u20131 thanks to two first half goals from set-pieces ending the calendar year in 12th place in the League One table with 36 points from 25 matches played. Present at the game were two trialists captain of Middlesbrough under\u201321 side's Matthew Dolan and former Chelsea trainee Aliu Djal\u00f3 with a view to them signing on loan and permanently respectively in the January transfer window. Defender Byron Webster received recognition for his goal and impressive performance in the League One Team of the Week."]}]}}
