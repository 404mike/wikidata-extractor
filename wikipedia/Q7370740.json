Starting with the Persian word gur\u011f/gur\u011f\u0101n, the word was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages. This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-Caspian region, which was referred to as Gorgan (\"land of the wolves\")."]}, {"page": "Matenadaran", "response": ["There has been steady growth in the number of manuscripts preserved at the Matenadaran, mostly from gifts from private individuals from the Armenian diaspora.

Thomas de Waal noted that in a 1997 pamphlet titled \"The Albanian Monuments of Karabakh\" by Igrar Aliyev and Kamil Mamedzade \"carefully left out all the Armenian writing\" in the depiction of the fa\u00e7ade of Gandzasar on its cover.
