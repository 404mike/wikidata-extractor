The UDA women's department was headed by Jean Moore, who also came from the Shankill Road. She had also served as the president of the women's auxiliary of the Loyalist Association of Workers. Her brother Ingram \"Jock\" Beckett, one of the UDA's founding members, had been killed in March 1972 by a rival UDA faction in an internal dispute.Dillon, Martin; Lehane, Denis (1973).
