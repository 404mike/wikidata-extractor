She completed her training as a nurse with the silver medal, but declined to join the League of St Barnabas, an Anglican society for nurses. She took her midwifery training at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, then returned to St Thomas' Hospital as a ward nursing sister. When war broke out in 1939 she joined the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QARANC), was mobilised at Congleton, was present during the evacuation from Dunkirk, and served in, among other places, Iran and Italy. On her return to civilian life she was named administrative sister at St Thomas' as preparation for her appointment as matron of Liverpool's  Royal Infirmary.\nTurner left in 1953 to care for her elderly parents. When she was free from family commitments she was appointed matron and lady superintendent of nurses of St Thomas' when the hospital was being rebuilt after being hit 13 times by German bombs. Turner deputised as a Royal College of Nursing representative on the Whitley Council which negotiated nurses' salaries. After retiring, she became president of the RCN. She later relocated to Scotland, where she served on the  Argyll and Clyde Health Board.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Congleton", "response": ["* Theodora Turner OBE ARRC (1907\u20131999), born in Congleton, nurseThe Independent, Obituaries: Theodora Turner, 31 August 1999 retrieved December 2017 and hospital matron."]}, {"page": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery", "response": ["* Theodora Turner, matron and nurse superintendent of St Thomas' Hospital (especially during its reconstruction period after the German bombing) as well as former president of Royal College of Nursing"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the University of London", "response": ["* Theodora Turner (KCL)"]}, {"page": "Alicia Lloyd Still", "response": ["Among Lloyd Still's notable students was Theodora Turner, a future President of the Royal College of Nursing."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Theodora Turner  - nurse superintendent of St Thomas' Hospital (during reconstruction after the Blitz), became president of Royal College of Nursing"]}, {"page": "Godolphin School", "response": ["*Theodora Turner, nurse"]}, {"page": "1961 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Theodora Turner, , Matron, St. Thomas's Hospital and Superintendent, Nightingale Training School."]}]}}
