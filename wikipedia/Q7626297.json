In 2006 he began working with American graphic designer, writer and editor David Reinfurt under the pseudonym Dexter Sinister, which is also the name of their 'just-in-time workshop and occasional bookstore' on New York's Lower East Side. Reinfurt replaced Bil'ak as co-editor of Dot Dot Dot the same year; it continued under Bailey and Reinfurt's direction until the final, 20th issue in 2010 before being replaced by Bulletins of the Serving Library, co-edited by Bailey and Reinfurt together with American artist and writer Angie Keefer until 2017. The journal has since morphed into a non-profit organization that variously serves as a publishing platform, a seminar room, a collection of framed objects, and an event space. The Serving Library Annual is co-edited by Stuart Bertolotti-Bailey, Italian curator and editor Francesca Bertolotti-Bailey, David Reinfurt, and Italian writer and translator Vincenzo Latronico, and published by Roma Publications], Amsterdam.

Dot Dot Dot is a biannual, self- published, after-hours magazine, originally centred around graphic design, later broadening in scope to interdisciplinary journalism on subjects that affect the way people look at the world, think about and make design. It was not to be a magazine showing visual outcomes of the design process, but presenting the recurring themes of daily work. It was designed to change the way of thinking from 'what a design magazine should show' to 'what we are interested in as designers'. After three issues, the tagline 'graphic design/visual communication magazine', was scrapped, since Bi\u013eak thought there was no reason why some things like film, music, literature should not be in the magazine. The only connection it has with graphic design is that the co-founders studied design. The last issue of Dot Dot Dot magazine was published in summer 2010."]}]}}
