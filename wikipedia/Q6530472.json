The same year Vangelis composed his first ballet score, for a production by Wayne Eagling. It was originally performed by Lesley Collier and Eagling himself at an Amnesty International gala at the Drury Lane theatre. In 1984 the Royal Ballet School presented it again at the Sadler's Wells theatre. In 1985 and 1986, Vangelis wrote music for two more ballets: \"Frankenstein \u2013 Modern Prometheus\" and \"The Beauty and the Beast\". In 1992, Vangelis wrote the music for the Euripides play, Medea, that featured Irene Papas.
