In the 1980s, she attended Balliol College, Oxford, then became a prominent member of London's social scene. She worked for her father, Robert Maxwell, until his death in 1991, when she moved to New York City, where she continued living as a socialite and had a relationship with Epstein. In 2012, Maxwell founded a non-profit group for the protection of oceans. Following sex trafficking allegations being brought by prosecutors against Epstein in July 2019, the organisation announced cessation of operations the same month. Maxwell is a naturalised US citizen and retains both French and British citizenship.On 2 July 2020, Maxwell was arrested and charged by the federal government of the United States with the crimes of enticement of minors and sex trafficking of underage girls, related to her association with Epstein. Maxwell was denied bail as a flight risk, with the judge expressing concerns regarding her \"completely opaque\" finances, her skill at living in hiding, and the fact that France does not extradite its citizens. On 29 December 2021, she was convicted on five out of six counts, including one of sex trafficking of a minor.
