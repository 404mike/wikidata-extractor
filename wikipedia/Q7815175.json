It was here that Jack Southworth suffered a leg injury that ended his career and without him Everton's air of invincibility slipped. Blackburn came from behind to beat the ten men and Everton then suffered a string of draws before returning to winning ways. Fred Geary took over at centre forward but yet again found himself losing the berth as Abe Hartley proved more potent in front of goal. Despite having seen off two rivals, Richard Williams' place in goal remained one that the selectors aimed to rectify. Reserves William Sutton and Tom Cain each got their chance but both were considered unworthy, which saw the board spend \u00a3150 to bring 'Happy' Jack Hillman from Burnley with Williams leaving to join Luton. Hillman was established as the regular keeper by the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Bill Rowley", "response": ["A number of serious injuries interrupted his career, with Tom Cain taking over in goal for most of the 1893\u201394 season.

The team started the season badly, losing four of the first five matches, all of which were away from home.

Eventually, under trainer Dawson's guidance, the team's form improved and there were only two further league defeats; after mid-December, the team suffered only one defeat and kept eight \"clean sheets\", despite first-choice goalkeeper Tom Cain missing several matches through injury.
