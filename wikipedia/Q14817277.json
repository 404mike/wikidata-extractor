A typical episode begins with Brand reviewing the events of the previous episode while showing clips, including unseen footage from the tent, usually humorous outtakes. Afterwards, she interviews the panelists about the current episode and what happened in the tent that week. In the next segment, she presents images of bakes viewers have sent in, the talks about the bakes the audience have brought to the studio, at least one of which the panelists try. In the final segment, the most recently eliminated baker joins the panel and is interviewed again by Brand. The baker is invited to bring one of their \"less-successful bakes\" which Brand and the panel sample. The segment concludes with the baker being presented a cake that captures their time in the tent. Brand concludes the show by showing a preview of what will happen in the next episode of the main show."]}, {"page": "Cruttenden", "response": ["* Hal Cruttenden  (born 1969), English stand-up comedian, writer and actor"]}, {"page": "The John Bishop Show (2015 TV series)", "response": ["| 4 || 20 June 2015 || The Vaccines, The Overtones, Vikki Stone, Hal Cruttenden, Tanyalee Davis, Spark Fire Dance, Jimeoin & Brian Cox"]}, {"page": "The Saturday Show (2015 TV series)", "response": ["| Claire Goose, Hal Cruttenden and Rav Wilding"]}, {"page": "It's Not Me, It's You (game show)", "response": ["|Hal Cruttenden and Louie Spence"]}, {"page": "Pierre Novellie", "response": ["He is known for his work as a comedian, actor, and writer, having recently been seen and heard on The Mash Report, Chris Ramsey's Stand Up Central  and The Now Show.
