He was on the books of Leicester City as an apprentice but failed to make the break into senior football there. He played for Atherstone United and Nuneaton Borough in non-league football before signing for Oxford United in 1980. He formed a notable defensive partnership with Gary Briggs and went on to become captain of the side as they rose from Division Three to Division One. His finest moment as captain was lifting the Milk Cup at Wembley Stadium in April 1986. At the end of the following season he was transferred to Portsmouth. He later played for Huddersfield Town, Barnsley, Hull City and Ayr United and, after his playing career ended, served as assistant manager at Barnsley.\nIn 1998 he returned to Oxford as manager, replacing Malcolm Crosby. His appointment was popular and initially successful, as he led the team out of relegation danger to a creditable 12th-place finish in Division One. However, United were relegated to Division Two at the end of the following season, and Shotton resigned in October 1999, with the club in serious danger of a second successive relegation. \nIn 2021, it was revealed on the Football Cliches podcast that three early teenagers impersonated Shotton to make fake transfer enquiries directly to club managers. This led to Roy Evans, Martin O\u2019Neill, Barry Fry and others to speculate on transfer dealings directly to the impersonators who ran their scam from a payphone. It is unclear whether Shotton was aware of this during his Oxford United tenure.\nShotton later served as assistant manager at Bradford City Director of Football at Loughborough University and manager of Barnsley College Academy Team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford United F.C.", "response": ["The 1996\u201397 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and included the sale of Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United's financial situation with the new stadium, and the threat of administration caused a group of fans to set up a pressure group called Fighting for Oxford United's Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club's plight through a series of meetings and events, including a 'Scarf of Unity', which was a collection of scarves from various clubs which was long enough to stretch around the perimeter of the pitch.Brodetsky p.93. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd's 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for \u00a31, with which he also inherited the club's estimated \u00a315 million debt.Brodetsky p.94. Kassam reduced \u00a39 million of the debt to just \u00a3900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which unsecured creditors who were owed over \u00a31,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for \u00a36 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled.Brodetsky p.97.

Despite being on a run to the semi-finals of the FA Cup and being in the hunt for promotion to the Premier League, Nigel Spackman stood down in March after less than a year in charge of Sheffield United, with his assistant Steve Thompson taking charge for the crucial final weeks of the season. Steve Bruce, the Birmingham City captain, was then appointed player-manager at Bramall Lane. At the other end of the table, Terry Bullivant was sacked by Reading in March having only been appointed the previous summer, with the former Celtic manager Tommy Burns being appointed as his successor. Stoke City began the season with Chic Bates as manager, but a mid-season downturn in form saw his dismissal in January and the appointment of Chris Kamara, who won just one of his 14 games in charge and was dismissed with five games left to play and Stoke deep in the relegation battle. Alan Durban took charge for the final five games, but was unable to save the Potters from relegation. Manchester City sacked manager Frank Clark in February after just over a year in charge, and replaced him with the former Everton manager Joe Royle. QPR's dismal form saw manager Bruce Rioch replaced by West Bromwich Albion's Ray Harford in early December, with Harford's successor at The Hawthorns being Denis Smith, recruited from debt-ridden Oxford United. The new manager at the Manor Ground was Malcolm Shotton, who managed to guide the Thames Valley side to a secure mid table finish in spite of the club's rising debts, which resulted in construction of the club's new stadium being halted. Portsmouth sacked Terry Fenwick in February after three years in charge and replaced him with Alan Ball, the manager of their most recent promotion-winning side in 1987. Huddersfield Town's dismal start to the campaign saw Brian Horton sacked in September and replaced by Peter Jackson, who guided the Terriers to a secure mid table finish. Mike Walker, whose first spell in charge of Norwich City had seen a Premier League title challenge and a memorable UEFA Cup run, stood down at Carrow Road with several games still to play as Norwich headed for another disappointing mid table finish. After the season was over, the Carrow Road board of directors appointed Bruce Rioch as their sixth manager in as many years."]}, {"page": "List of Oxford United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Malcolm Shotton"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Malcolm Shotton||||DF||2||1||0||0||2||0||0||0||4||1"]}]}}
