In 1907 a small group of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League.Bartley, pp. 91\u201393; Purvis 2002, pp. 96\u201399; Pugh, pp. 165\u2013168. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting\u00a0... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.E. Pankhurst 1914, p. 59."]}, {"page": "Florence Haig", "response": ["Haig left the East London Federation at the start of World War I and joined Emmeline Pankhurst, Annie Kenney and Mabel Tuke in their halt of militancy and turning to support the war effort.  Haig was one of the movement chosen as coffin carriers at Emmeline Pankhurst's funeral in June 1928."]}, {"page": "Jessie Stephenson", "response": ["Stephenson described the treatment of women on arrival having their hair let down and searched, undressing to be searched, but since the change in rules, then allowed to wear their own clothes unlike most other prisoners. She was also allowed to get a letter from her barrister, saying she would lose her job and accommodation if she did not pay the fine to be released, but she refused and completed her sentence with the other imprisoned suffragettes. Fifteen, including Stephenson and Mary Clarke, were released just before Christmas, to be met by Emmeline Pankhurst, Mabel Tuke and a group of three hundred supporters."]}, {"page": "Katherine \"Kitty\" Marshall", "response": ["Marshall was with Emmeline Pankhurst and Mabel Tuke on 1 March 1912, and all were arrested after pulling up in a taxicab and stoning two windows of Number 10 (as Mrs Pankhurst's stone missed). Within an hour, the campaign of 150 suffragettes (a few every quarter of an hour) broke the windows in shops and in commercial property across Haymarket, Piccadilly, Regent Street, the Strand, Oxford Street and Bond Street. Within one day 125 were arrested for causing \u00a35,000 of wilful damage. ", "At their trial for conspiracy, Mrs Pankhurst and Marshall were sentenced to two months (her third prison term), Mabel Tuke sentenced to three weeks.  Marshall wrote about the chaos at Holloway with over a hundred women on remand trying to be separated from those convicted. All were singing The Marseillaise to suffragette lyrics, and breaking the glass windows of cells for air. Marshall said \"I believe the row we made could be heard some miles away.\" Marshall was given five days in a 'bitterly cold' underground solitary confinement cell for breaking 40 panes in the prison. This led to a depression, constant crying, transfer to the hospital wing, and her release on 12 April."]}, {"page": "Marjery Bryce", "response": ["The image of Saint Joan was seen to represent  'the militant women's ideal....in every act of hers they recognize the same spirit as that which strengthens them to risk their liberty and endure torture for the sake of freedom'.  And the leaders of WSPU, Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Mabel Tuke led the parade, with groups of women's trades and professions, or, like Bryce, dressed as famous women from the past. Christabel in particular felt the image of Joan of Arc included the willingness to undertake physical hardship  and emphasised the martial (masculine) qualities as an image of fighting for a cause of right. This was summed up a ' the loveliness of simplicity, purity, courage and militancy' which Bryce was acting in this parade and was an image used by WSPU as a symbol."]}]}}
