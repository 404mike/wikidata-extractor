White's batting style is unknown, though it is known he played as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Bulwell, Nottinghamshire.\nWhite made his debut in first-class for the North of England in the North v South fixture of 1886 at Lords', during which White scored 62 runs batting at number ten in a tenth record stand of 157 runs with John Parnham (who made 90 not out), in what was the highest wicket partnership of the innings. The North won the match by 9 wickets. In that same season he made a first-class appearance for Liverpool and District against the touring Australians, and followed this up with a second first-class appearance for the team in 1890 against Yorkshire. He ended his brief first-class career with 73 runs at an average of 18.25, with four catches and two stumpings to his name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John White", "response": ["John White is the
