With Hugh, he was a member in the early Canterbury scene band Wilde Flowers. He also played saxophone on Soft Machine's album Volume Two and co-wrote several tracks on their eponymous debut.  The death of two bandmates in the early 1970s discouraged Hopper from pursuing a proper career in music, so he went into agricultural crop protection research and development instead.Only in the latter part of the 1990s, did Hopper re-emerge as an artist of contemporary as well as historical significance.

In 1968 he became a founding member of Caravan, switching to bass guitar and sharing lead vocals with Pye Hastings. His compositional output came to the fore on the band's third album, the classic In the Land of Grey and Pink, on which he wrote and sang the title track, \"Golf Girl\" and the epic \"Winter Wine\". Sinclair left Caravan in 1972 to form Hatfield and the North with ex-Delivery members Phil Miller and Pip Pyle, lending his distinctive, quintessentially English voice and increasingly impressive bass playing skills to their two albums, and writing some of their best-loved songs, \"Share It\", \"Let's Eat (Real Soon)\" (both with lyrics by Pip Pyle) and \"Halfway Between Heaven And Earth\".
