Borchgrevink was evidently no autocrat but, Bernacchi said, without the framework of an accepted hierarchy a state of \"democratic anarchy\" prevailed, with \"dirt, disorder and inactivity the order of the day\".Fiennes, p.\u00a043. Furthermore, as winter developed, Borchgrevink's hopes that Cape Adare would escape the worst Antarctic weather proved false; in fact he had chosen a site which was particularly exposed to the freezing winds blown northwards from the inland ice.Mills, pp.\u00a094\u201395. As time progressed, tempers wore thin; the party became irritable and boredom set in.Crane, p.\u00a0153."]}, {"page": "Albert Armitage", "response": ["Armitage was then Robert Falcon Scott's navigator and second-in-command on the Discovery Expedition to Antarctica.

On this expedition, he became the first person to walk on the polar plateau."]}, {"page": "Discovery Expedition", "response": ["The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist. The geologist, Hartley Ferrar, was a 22-year-old recent Cambridge graduate who Markham thought \"might be made into a man.\" Marine biologist Thomas Vere Hodgson, from Plymouth Museum, was a more mature figure, as was the senior of the two doctors, Reginald Koettlitz, who, at 39, was the oldest member of the expedition. He, like Armitage, had been with the Jackson\u2013Harmsworth expedition. The junior doctor and zoologist was Edward Wilson, who became close to Scott and provided the qualities of calmness, patience and detachment that the captain reportedly lacked."]}, {"page": "List of L\u00e9gion d'honneur recipients by name (B)", "response": ["* Louis Bernacchi"]}, {"page": "Water sky", "response": ["When light hits the blue oceans or seas, some of it bounces back and enables the observer to physically see the water. However, some of the light also is reflected back up on to the bottoms of low-lying clouds and causes a dark spot to appear underneath some clouds. These clouds may be visible when the seas are not and can show alert and knowledgeable travelers the general direction of water. The dark clouds over open water have long been used by polar explorers and scientists to navigate in sea ice. For example, Arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his assistant Hjalmar Johansen used the phenomenon to find lanes of water in their failed expedition to the North Pole, as did Louis Bernacchi and Douglas Mawson in Antarctica."]}, {"page": "Louis C.

Borchgrevink readily agreed to these conditions, even though only two of the entire expedition party were British.Jones, pp. 59\u201360. Another member of the shore party, Louis Bernacchi, was Australian; the remainder were all Scandinavian. This annoyed Markham all the more,Crane, p. 74 and he subsequently rebuked the RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch. Mill had toasted the success of the expedition, calling it \"a reproach to human enterprise\" that there were parts of the earth that man had never attempted to reach. He hoped that this reproach would be lifted through \"the munificence of Sir George Newnes and the courage of Mr Borchgrevink\".Borchgrevink, p. 25", "Among the scientists was the Tasmanian Louis Bernacchi, who had studied magnetism and meteorology at the Melbourne Observatory. He had been appointed to the Belgian Antarctic Expedition of 1897\u20131899, but had been unable to take up his post when the expedition's ship, the , had failed to call at Melbourne on its way south.

In 1982 the Russian ichthyologist Arkady Vladimirovich Balushkin placed this species, and all the other species in its genus bar the type species, T. newnesi, in the new genus Pseudotrematomus but this has not been widely accepted.
