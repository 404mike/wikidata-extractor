Aged 17 at the time, he must have been a genuine 1773 debutant.  He was a native of Bagshot in Surrey.\nHe played frequently for Surrey but was still only 26 when his career ended in 1782.\nHe seems to have been known as \"Field\" and this often appeared on old scorecards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|Henry Attfield", "|Henry Attfield, CricketArchive.
