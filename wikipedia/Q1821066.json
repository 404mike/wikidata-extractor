(Forward)\". The song would prove controversial for the alleged fights it caused in clubs, leading to many venues banning the song from being played. This made it difficult for Lethal Bizzle to find a platform to perform his music. Lethal stated in 2012 to The Guardian that he was unable to play in urban clubs for over a year due to the bans placed on him. Many other grime artists also experienced difficulties performing in clubs due to Form 696, a police risk assessment form that many clubs were asked to fill in by the Metropolitan police. The form was created in 2005 after a spate of gun violence in clubs. The form was criticised in 2009 by John Whittingdale, a Conservative Party MP, for being \"draconian\". The form was also criticised for allegedly targeting black music nights due to it asking specifically what ethnic groups may be attending the event. Many grime raves were shut down by police using the form. Lethal Bizzle stated in 2012 this led to a shift from making grime music for the clubs, to making grime music for \"in-your-house listening\". Form 696 has been blamed for contributing to the decline in popularity grime experienced during the late 2000s.", "Grime did still have some success during this period, such as the popular Tempa T song \"Next Hype\" released in 2009. \"Pow\" by Lethal Bizzle was dubbed the 'unofficial song' of the 2010 student protests.

The forum was a major platform for grime music at the time, providing a space for artists to promote themselves and a space for fans to discuss grime as a whole, something that was important to people outside of London due to the lack of information they had access to.
