At the 1929 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Eastbourne in East Sussex, and held the seat at the 1931 general election.\nHe died in office on 2 April 1932, committing suicide by shooting himself in the chest while in the billiard room of his stepfather, Lord Hailsham's house in Sussex.  He had been jilted for a second time. Marjoribanks had just completed the first volume of a planned three-volume account of the trials of Sir Edward Carson; his last chapter being the George Archer-Shee case. The work was finished by another author. At the  resulting 1932 Eastbourne by-election, the Conservative candidate John Slater was returned unopposed.\nAt the time of his death, Marjoribanks was heir presumptive to the hereditary peerage held by his cousin, Lord Tweedmouth (the title became extinct in 1935).
