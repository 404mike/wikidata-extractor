Barber (1866\u20131930; Chinese: \u548c\u53d7\u6069; Pinyin: H\u00e9 Sh\u00f2u\u0113n; Foochow Romanized: Hu\u00f2 S\u00eau-\u014fng), was a British missionary in China.  She was born in 1866 in Peasenhall, Suffolk, England, the daughter of Louis (a wheelwright) and Martha (n\u00e9e Gibbs) Barber. The family moved to 59 St Martins Lane Norwich around 1876 and established a Carriage Manufacturing business. The family home in Norwich (see georgeplunkett.co.uk for a view of 59 St Martins Lane) was opposite St Martins Parish church which was intensely evangelical in the 1880 - 90s and must have had an influence on the Barber family. During the course of her life, she lived in China twice to preach the Christian gospel.  She left her home and travelled in a lonely way thousands of miles.  Barber, who initially went to China as an Anglican, became an independent missionary with informal ties to the Plymouth Brethren.  She is best known for her influence on Watchman Nee (Nee Tuo-Sheng).Along the south China coast (in Foochow), she and others regularly taught a Bible class at \"White Teeth Rock\".  There she had contact with Nee who was studying at Anglican Trinity College.  Barber referred him to books by J. N. Darby, Madam Jeanne Guyon, Jessie Penn-Lewis, D. M. Panton, T. Austin Sparks, and of others, which had been of help to her.  She also influenced others Chinese Christian leaders, including Leland Wang who later formed the Chinese Foreign Missionary Union.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Nelson Darby", "response": ["Charles Henry Mackintosh, 1820\u20131896, with his popular style spread Darby's teachings to humbler elements in society and may be regarded as the journalist of the Brethren Movement.
