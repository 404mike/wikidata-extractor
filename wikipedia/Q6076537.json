It then returned to typical Conservative\u2013Liberal rivalry.  Labour made little impact in its early years; by 1918, there were only three Labour councillors (and two Liberal-Labour, plus one Lib-Lab alderman).  That all changed in 1919; Labour won almost all the seats up for election that year, giving them 12 and their coalition partners the Co-operative Party two.  In response to their losses, the Conservative and Liberal groups merged to form the Citizens Association, retaining control with 32 councillors and 15 aldermen.  The Lib-Labs remained unchanged in numbers and politically between the two groups.J. Mendelson, W. Owen, S. Pollard and V. M.

Long leases and small rents attracted people to build houses and crofts.  Sheffield Town Council decided to build its second workhouse on 48 acres of meadows in Hollow Meadows, on the initiative of Isaac Ironside; he hoped to provide a healthier alternative to existing workhouse conditions, and to show that a workhouse could be profitable.  Other councillors noted the advantage of removing able-bodied men from the reach of potential political agitation.  Paupers were initially put to work clearing the land and constructing the building, which included a dining room and dormitories.  An average of 45 able-bodied men were based at the site, which was nicknamed \"New England\".  Despite a high initial outlay, the farm started to turn a profit, but the management of the scheme was criticised as overly lax.  From 1854, paupers were not permitted to engage in farming, only in clearing land and, once cleared, the land was let.  Ironside withdrew from involvement, and the project gradually ran down.W. H. G.
