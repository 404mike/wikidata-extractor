Stephen Storace (1762\u20131796), the son of an Italian musician based in Dublin was an accomplished composer; and his sister Anna, known as Nancy (1765\u20131817), formerly also a student of Rauzzini, a talented soprano. They had already had much experience in Italy and in Vienna, where in 1786 Nancy created the first Susanna in Mozart's Figaro, and both had been friends of the composer. In Vienna Nancy had contracted an unfortunate marriage with the psychopathic English composer John Abraham Fisher, from whom she soon separated. At Braham's d\u00e9but, which was the first of the season at Bath, Nancy also performed, as a soloist and in a duet with him. It was the starting-point of a liaison which was to last for over twenty years, during which Nancy bore Braham a son, Spencer."]}, {"page": "Nancy Storace", "response": ["On 29 March 1784,Vienna, Evangelisch-Reformierte Stadtkirche H.B., No. 4985. she was married to John Abraham Fisher, a 40-year-old composer and violinist. The marriage went badly, as Fisher abused and may have beaten her.In his memoirs Michael Kelly, who was Storace's friend, wrote \"it was said he had a very striking way of enforcing his opinion.\" Word of this got to the Emperor, who was heavily involved in running his opera company, and he ordered Fisher to leave Vienna.Michael Kelly says so in his Reminiscences, I, p. 229. Fisher complied, moving to Ireland. Storace was pregnant with a child, which was born on 30 January 1785; this daughter, Josepha Fisher, lived until 17 July 1785.Michael Lorenz, Review of Melanie Unseld: Mozarts Frauen.
