He made his debut on 14 January in a 2\u20132 home draw with Morecambe, but Kozluk was released from Bradford in May 2012 after being told his contract would not be renewed.

In the summer transfer window, he made two signings Simon Ramsden and Fraser Kerr. McCall attempted to sign the returning James McFadden and Ryan Stevenson, but both were unsuccessful. McCall then managed the club's first Champions League match in the second round against Panathinaikos, but they proved to be too strong and Motherwell failed to win either leg losing 2\u20130 and 3\u20130 respectively, which McCall described as \"cruel\". After the match, Motherwell entered the Europa League play-offs to face Levante; McCall wanted to play with an \"up-and-at-them approach\" against the Spaniards. Once again, their opposition proved to be too strong and they lost each leg 2\u20130 and 1\u20130 respectively, ending the club's European competitions; the second game at the Estadi Ciutat de Val\u00e8ncia had Motherwell playing with a youthful and inexperienced squad due to injuries."]}, {"page": "Tom Newey", "response": ["Newey was also told by Rochdale a few days later that he would not be invited to join the club for the new season, something he had expressed his desire to do after admitting enjoying working alongside Dale players, and former Grimsby teammates Simon Ramsden and Ciaran Toner."]}, {"page": "Glen Downey", "response": ["In his first appearance of the 05\u201306 season Downey impressed after replacing the injured Rob Jones in the impressive 1-0 Football League Cup victory away against Derby County.

A slight aggravation in his old injury would eventually see Tony lose his place to Whittle in the team in September 2005, and after several months on the sidelines he had appeared to gain weight rapidly and became alarmingly unfit by the standards of a professional footballer. Crane returned from injury but found his chances of first team football to be non-existent, despite the sale of Simon Ramsden too Rochdale, Crane was constantly overlooked in the first team with manager Russell Slade preferring to name reserve Glen Downey as the defensive option on the bench. Crane was made available for loan in October with Russell Slade slamming him for his poor fitness and also his lack of enthusiasm to shed weight and in November 2005 fellow League Two side Wrexham made an approach to sign him, but this bid was rejected on the basis that Crane didn't fancy a move to Wales. Also interested were Conference North outfit Worksop Town, and shortly afterwards Crane joined the Nottinghamshire club on an initial three-month loan."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|04 ||  Simon Ramsden || Rochdale || 23 || Free Transfer"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|04 ||  Simon Ramsden || Sunderland || 22 || Free Transfer"]}, {"page": "2008 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["|CB ||2||Simon Ramsden"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Football League Two", "response": ["| Simon Ramsden"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Simon Ramsden"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Simon Ramsden"]}, {"page": "Ramsden (surname)", "response": ["*Simon Ramsden (born 1981), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Sunderland A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Simon Ramsden"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["| Simon Ramsden", "||| DF|| 15 ||Simon Ramsden"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["||| DF|| 4 ||Simon Ramsden"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["|rowspan=\"8\"|8 ||||5 ||Simon Ramsden||1||0||0||0||1", "|||DF||5 ||Simon Ramsden", "| Simon Ramsden"]}]}}
