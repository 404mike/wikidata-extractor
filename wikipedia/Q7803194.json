At the time he was still studying for his A-levels but was given permission to play. Leicestershire coach, Tim Boon, said that whether Taylor played depended on the pitch and if it merited an extra batsman. Taylor was selected and batted at seven and scored eight runs before being trapped leg before wicket (lbw) in his only innings by Kabir Ali. The game ended in a draw, as both teams were frustrated by the weather. Two months later he made his Twenty20 (T20) debut along with teammate Sam Cliff in a seven-wicket defeat against Derbyshire. Despite two late victories, including a win in the return fixture against Derbyshire at Grace Road where Taylor contributed 10, Leicestershire finished bottom of their group in the 2008 Twenty20 Cup. In a three-day tour match against Bangladesh A as part of their 2008 tour of England, Taylor made only his second first-class appearance. The match ended in a draw and Taylor made his maiden half-century of 51 from 109 balls before being caught off Shakib Al Hasan. Taylor finished his one-day season with two Natwest pro40 games against Derbyshire and Surrey. He top scored with 43 not out in a narrow six-run victory against Derbyshire and hit 37 in a loss against Surrey before being caught off youngster Stuart Meaker to end his Leicestershire season on a high. Taylor was awarded the Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year for his 898 runs for Shrewsbury School in 2008, at an average of 179.60. The award also recognised his Youth International appearances and his County matches."]}, {"page": "2010 Twenty20 Cup", "response": ["|Tim Boon"]}, {"page": "2012 Under-19 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["Coach:  Tim Boon"]}, {"page": "Timboon (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Tim Boon"]}, {"page": "Boon (surname)", "response": ["*Tim Boon (born 1961), English cricketer"]}]}}
