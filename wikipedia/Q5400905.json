H. White continued. One of the last of the Victorian Fairy-paintings, The Piper of Dreams by Estella Canziani, sold 250,000 copies and was well known within the trenches of World War I where Tolkien saw active service. Illustrated posters of Robert Louis Stevenson's poem Land of Nod had been sent out by a philanthropist to brighten servicemen's quarters, and Faery was used in other contexts as an image of \"Old England\" to inspire patriotism. By 1915, when Tolkien was writing his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many divergent and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against the term 'fairy', which John Garth supposes may have been due to its growing association with homosexuality, but Tolkien continued to use it. According to Marjorie Burns, Tolkien eventually but hesitantly chose the term elf over fairy. In his 1939 essay On Fairy-Stories, Tolkien wrote that \"English words such as elf have long been influenced by French (from which fay and fa\u00ebrie, fairy are derived); but in later times, through their use in translation, fairy and elf have acquired much of the atmosphere of German, Scandinavian, and Celtic tales, and many characteristics of the huldu-f\u00f3lk, the daoine-sithe, and the tylwyth-teg.\""]}, {"page": "Society of Painters in Tempera", "response": ["In 1904, members of the Society were: Edwin Austin Abbey, Robert Bateman, John Dickson Batten, his wife Mary Batten, Robert Anning Bell, Lota Bowen, John Cooke, Walter Crane, Louis Davis, Mary Sargant Florence and  Roger Fry.Volume 1 Papers of The Society of Painters in Tempera   Other notable  members included Bernard Sleigh, Joseph Southall and Estella Canziani."]}, {"page": "August 1964", "response": ["* Died: Estella Canziani, 87, British travel writer, folklorist and painter"]}, {"page": "Louisa Starr", "response": ["She married Enrico Canziani and thereafter signed her works with her married name.
