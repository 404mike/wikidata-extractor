Humanism is defined as a champion of human freedom and dignity but it is linked to oppression through it being a byproduct of modernity. In 1974, philosopher Sidney Hook defined humanism and humanists by negative characteristics. According to Hook, humanists are opposed to the imposition of one culture in some civilizations, do not belong to a church or established religion, do not support dictatorships, do not justify violence for social reforms or are more loyal to an organization than their abstract values. Hook also said humanists support the elimination of  hunger and improvements to health, housing, and education.  Also writing in 1974, humanist philosopher H. J. Blackham said humanism is a concept that focuses on improving the social conditions of humanity, increasing the autonomy and dignity of all humans. In 1999, Jeaneane D. Fowler said the definition of humanism should include a rejection of divinity, and an emphasis on human well-being and freedom. She also comments there is a lack of a shared belief system or doctrine but, in general, humanists are aiming for happiness and self-fulfillment."]}, {"page": "H.J.
