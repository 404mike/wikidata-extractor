He was also selected to be the SNP candidate in the 2009 Glasgow North East by-election, but decided to step aside after it was reported that he may have breached charity law by acting as an \"unpaid\" partner-director of Culture and Sport Glasgow while he was covered by a protected trust deed - an arrangement which avoids a court-ordered bankruptcy.He represented the Langside ward on Glasgow City Council from 3 May 2007 until 3 May 2012 and was the SNP group leader on the council until June 2011, when he was succeeded by Councillor Allison Hunter.In 2012, Dornan was appointed as a SNP Depute Whip.On 25 February 2020, Dornan announced he would not be standing at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. However, in July 2020, he reversed his decision and announced that he would put himself forward again for election. Later in July 2020, the SNP National Executive Committee voted have an all-woman shortlist for the Glasgow Cathcart Scottish Parliamentary constituency, ending his bid of standing for the seat again. However, after the decision, Dornan announced that he would challenge the decision. The SNP National Secretary then reversed the all-woman shortlist and Dornan was permitted to stand. Dornan was selected to stand for the SNP in the Glasgow Cathcart Scottish Parliamentary constituency and held the seat with 57% of the vote.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| James Dornan(SNP)"]}, {"page": "Mount Florida", "response": ["Mount Florida is in the Langside ward for Glasgow City Council and since May 2012 is represented by Councillors Archie Graham, Susan Aitken and Liam Hainey.
