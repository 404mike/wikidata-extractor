As a writer of screenplays, he was employed at Disney's Burbank studio from 1961 until his death in 1968.Westerby's 1937 novel Wide Boys Never Work, a story of the criminal underworld before the Second World War, was the an early published use of the term \"wide boy\". In 1956 the book was made into the British film Soho Incident (released in the United States as Spin a Dark Web). In 2008 London Books republished Wide Boys Never Work as part of their London Books classics series. Before then, M. Benny had published, in 1936, the novel 'Low Company', (published by 'P.
