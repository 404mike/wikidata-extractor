His parents belonged to the radical working classes. His father died when he was nine years old, and his mother provided for him by working as a waitress. He left school at 13, even though the normal leaving age was 14. He was able to leave a year early after taking the Board of Education Labour Exam, which was only  'open to fatherless boys' so that they could go to work to help support their family. His first job was as a pawnbroker's clerk. A succession of low paid jobs followed, while he continued to educate himself in Salford Public Library. During periods of unemployment he worked for the local Labour Party and began to write short stories.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
