Initially this was at the Aldersgate Medical School, and Windmill Street; and later at Westminster at the Hunterian School of Medicine. There was briefly (1830\u201331) a medical school in Brewer Street, set up by William Birmingham Costello, Epps and Michael Ryan. Epps and Ryan then joined George Darby Dermott in giving lectures at the Western Dispensary in Gerrard Street; James Fernandez Clarke, in his memoirs, described Epps lecturing there as well-read and sympathetic but not deeply versed in practical chemistry, or botany.James Fernandez Clarke, Autobiographical Recollections of the Medical Profession (1874), pp. 137\u20139; archive.org. Epps lectured publicly and extensively for the rest of his life, particularly on phrenology and homoeopathy, in London and elsewhere. When his health failed he continued to lecture in his own home."]}, {"page": "Erinensis", "response": ["James Fernandez Clarke, a medical journalist who worked on the Lancet in its early days, suggested in his autobiography that Erinensis was responsible for the power the Lancet wielded in the 1820s and 1830s.Clarke, p.11 At the end of the 1830s Green spent some time studying childhood diseases in Paris, after which he published articles on them in the Lancet, under his own name."]}, {"page": "Michael Ryan (physician)", "response": ["In editing from 1832 to 1838 the original London Medical and Surgical Journal, Ryan had some assistance from James Fernandez Clarke. His later publications included The Philosophy of Marriage in its Social, Moral, and Physical Relations; with an Account of the Diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs and the Physiology of Generation in the Vegetable and Animal Kingdom, 1837; this formed part of a course of obstetric lectures delivered at the North London School of Medicine. Twelve editions in all, the last in 1867, were issued. This work contained an attack on extreme proponents of birth control. It was followed in 1839 by Prostitution in London, with a Comparative View of that of Paris and New York \u2026 with an Account of the Nature and Treatment of the various Diseases. The historian Peter Gay classifies it as an \"alarmist\" work on prostitution, comparable to James Beard Talbot's Miseries of Prostitition, which appeared five years later."]}]}}
