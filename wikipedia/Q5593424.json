While at Selwyn College, Cambridge, early in the decade, he earned blues in both cricket and rugby. He performed well for their cricket team in 1934 with a century against Glamorgan to go with a pair of 90s that year, one of those when he was out for 94 in the match with Oxford. He captained Cambridge University in 1935, having twice led Gloucestershire in the 1932 County Championship.With Gloucestershire, he had his stand-out season in 1937 when he made 662 first-class runs at an average of 44.13. Amongst his three hundreds was a first innings score of 210 against Kent at the Crabble Athletic Ground in Dover, which he followed up with bowling figures of 3/78. He had also made a century in his previous match and continued his form with 155 against Nottinghamshire a week and a half after his double hundred.\nHe was capped the first time for the national rugby union team during the 1938 Home Nations Championship, when England defeated Ireland 36 to 14 at Lansdowne Road. Parker, playing as a full-back, contributed 15 of those points with six conversions and a penalty kick. England had been captained by Warwickshire cricketer Peter Cranmer. He also took part in England's five-point loss to Scotland at Twickenham and kicked three penalties.Following the 1938 county season, Parker joined the military and wouldn't return to cricket until 1947. During this time he served as a major in the Royal Army Service Corps, seeing action in both North Africa and Italy which won him a military MBE. This was later upgraded to an OBE following his command of the Combined Cadet Force at Blundell's School. He taught at Blundell's from 1946 to 1968, where he was housemaster of the Westlake boarding house from 1954, head of the geography department, and simultaneously, with Ted Crowe, was coach of the 1st XV rugby team.\nHe struggled on his return to first-class cricket and could only manage 103 runs at 11.44 from five matches in 1947. After scoring three centuries in a month with the Gloucestershire Second XI in the 1949 Minor Counties Championship, Parker was recalled into the county squad for the 1950 County Championship campaign and he made five appearances that year but just two the following season. He then captained Devon in the Minor Counties Championship from 1953 until 1956 when he retired.\nParker took over the secretary-managership of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 1968 and transformed the team to championship runners-up in 1969 and winners of the Gillette Cup in 1973 and the Benson and Hedges Cup in 1977. In 1986 and 1987 he served as the club's president.\nThe sports hall at the Crypt School is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blundell's School", "response": ["*Grahame Parker, sportsman"]}, {"page": "The Crypt School", "response": ["* Grahame Parker, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Gloucester City A.F.C.", "response": ["* Grahame Parker \u2013 Two caps for England Rugby"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Gloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was waiting in the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.Playfair, pp. 85\u201387."]}, {"page": "Tony Brown (English cricketer)", "response": ["As an administrator, he succeeded Grahame Parker as Secretary of Gloucestershire on his retirement from first-class cricket in 1976. In 1982 he became Secretary of Somerset, a post that he held for six years, during one of the more turbulent periods in the county\u2019s history, with the decision not to retain Garner and Richards, and the subsequent departure of Ian Botham upsetting many of the club\u2019s supporters.  In 1984 he was appointed Manager of the England Team that toured India and Australia in 1984/85 when the Test Series v India was won 2\u20131, by the team captained by David Gower and the ODI Series by 4\u20131; India were World ODI Cup Champions at that time.  He was also Manager of the England Tour which toured West Indies in 1986.  In 1988 he succeeded Brian Langley as Administration Secretary of the then TCCB (Test and County Cricket Board), now ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) until his retirement in 1997. He was Chairman of Cricket at Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 1999 until 2007 and President of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 2008 to 2011, when he was succeeded by his former team-mate, David Allen.
