He attracted the attention of many members of Parliament, through the support of Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England, (to whom he dedicated his Christian Astrology), but also accused Members of Parliament of engineering charges against him in 1651. To his supporters he was an \"English Merlin\"; to his detractors he was a \"juggling wizard and imposter\".", "He then began to issue his prophetical almanacs and other works, which met with serious attention from some of the most prominent members of the Long Parliament.  Lilly was on intimate terms with Bulstrode Whitelocke, William Lenthall the speaker, Sir Philip Stapleton, Elias Ashmole and others. Even John Selden seems to have acknowledged him, and probably the chief difference between him and the mass of the community at the time was that, while others believed in the general truth of astrology, he ventured to specify the future events to which he referred."]}, {"page": "Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood", "response": ["* Sir Bulstrode Whitelocke \u2013 Civil War politician who enshrined the principle that only parliament could dissolve parliament"]}, {"page": "Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry", "response": ["Lord Coventry held the great seal for nearly fifteen years (1625\u201340), and was enabled to collect a large fortune.

Bulstrode Whitelocke accuses him of mediocrity, but his contemporaries in general have united in extolling his judicial ability, his quick despatch of business and his sound and sterling character. Clarendon in particular praises his statesmanship, and compares his capacity with Lord Strafford's, adding, however, that he seldom spoke in the council except on legal business and had little influence in political affairs; to the latter circumstance he owed his exceptional popularity. He describes him as having \"in the plain way of speaking and delivery a strange power of making himself believed,\" as a man of \"not only firm gravity but a severity and even some morosity,\" as \"rather exceedingly liked than passionately loved.\""]}, {"page": "Thomas Fairfax", "response": ["In calling over the court, when the crier pronounced the name of Fairfax, it is said that his wife, Anne Fairfax, shouted from the gallery that \"he had more wit than to be there\".

This resulted in an investigation and Anne was asked or required to leave the court. It was said that Anne could not forbear, as Bulstrode Whitelocke says, to exclaim aloud against the proceedings of the High Court of Justice. In February 1649 Fairfax was elected Member of Parliament for Cirencester in the Rump Parliament.
