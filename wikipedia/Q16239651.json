The film is the autobiographical story of Bissett's father who was badly injured during an industrial accident at the Petrochemical plant in Falkirk and about the effect that the incident had on his family. The film also explores Bissett's relationship with his hometown and the industry that surrounds it. Stafford shot the film in thirteen hours during one evening for around fifty pounds and used the local Petrochemical Plant's eerie and cinematic landscape for the film's striking visual aesthetic. The film went on to win the \"Best Short Documentary\" award at the San Francisco International Film Festival, \"Best Short Documentary\" at Palm Springs Film Festival, along with both the Jury and Audience prizes for Scottish Short Film at the Jim Poole Awards. At the end of 2010 the film also won \"Best International Short Documentary\" at The Belo Horizonte Film Festival in Brazil and Grand Jury prize for \"Best European Short\" at Festival Premier Plans in France in January 2011."]}, {"page": "Just to Get a Rep", "response": ["Just to Get a Rep is a documentary film directed by Peter Gerard.
