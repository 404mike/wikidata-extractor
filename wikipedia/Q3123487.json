He had a successful career as an amateur golfer, with wins in several prestigious tournaments including the 2003 Scottish Boys' Championship, 2005 Brabazon Trophy, 2005 St Andrews Links Trophy, 2007 Irish Amateur Open Championship, 2007 Lytham Trophy, and the 2007 Scottish Champion of Champions. In 2005 he finished 15th in The Open Championship at St Andrews, to win the Silver Medal as the low amateur having finished one stroke ahead of Eric Ramsay.Saltman competed for Great Britain and Ireland in two Walker Cup matches, the first in 2005 and again in 2007. Shortly after his second appearance, he turned professional and attempted to qualify for the European Tour. However he failed to progress to the final stage of the qualifying school and, with limited guaranteed playing opportunities in Europe, decided to try for his card on the Asian Tour. He finished 31st at the Asian Tour School at the end of 2007, to gain a place on the tour. However, because of the reputation he built up as an amateur, Saltman received invitations to many European Tour and Challenge Tour events during 2008, and played in just two tournaments on the Asian Tour, finishing in 17th place on his d\u00e9but in the SAIL Open.At the end of 2008, Saltman returned to the European Tour's qualifying school, and although he reached the final stage after coming through a seven-man playoff, he missed out on winning a European Tour card meaning he would have another season on the Challenge Tour in 2009.\nIn July 2009 Saltman and his brother Elliot both qualified for the Open Championship at Turnberry, to become the first brothers to appear together in The Open since 1985, when Seve and Manuel Ballesteros both played. After two years on the European Challenge Tour Saltman gained a full European Tour Card in December 2010 by finishing 11th in the Stage 3 of European Tour Qualifying School. His youngest brother Zack, is also a professional golfer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Open Championship", "response": ["* 2005 \u2013  Lloyd Saltman"]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["*2003 Wallace Booth, Rhys Davies, Daniel Denison, Tommy Hunter, Cian McNamara, Aaron O'Callaghan, Lloyd Saltman, Gareth Shaw, Paul Waring"]}, {"page": "St Andrews Trophy", "response": ["*  Lloyd Saltman 2006"]}, {"page": "Challenge de Espa\u00f1a", "response": ["| 2008 ||  Andrew McArthur || align=center|280 || align=center|\u22128 || 1 stroke ||  Alfredo Garc\u00eda-Heredia Lloyd Saltman || Club de Golf Retamares"]}, {"page": "2007 Walker Cup", "response": ["| Lloyd Saltman", "|Lloyd Saltman", "|Lloyd Saltman"]}, {"page": "2005 Walker Cup", "response": ["* Lloyd Saltman", "|Lloyd Saltman", "|Lloyd Saltman"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Lloyd Saltman||1985\u2013"]}, {"page": "2005 Open Championship", "response": [":Scotscraig: Andrew Marshall, Lloyd Saltman (a), Murray Urquhart"]}, {"page": "Brabazon Trophy", "response": ["| 2005 || The Oxfordshire Golf Club ||  Lloyd Saltman || 278"]}, {"page": "2009 Open Championship", "response": [":Kilmarnock (Barassie): Markus Brier, Peter Ellebye, Daniel Gaunt, Lloyd Saltman"]}, {"page": "John Gallagher (golfer)", "response": ["Gallagher's most prolific amateur victory came at the 2007 Scottish Amateur Championship which was played at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire.

Gallagher's impressive run through one of the strongest fields in amateur golf put him on the international map and he was ranked 14th in the world among amateur golfers.
