Apart from studying his mother tongue English, he also studied Quechua and Spanish. He was Honorary President of the Greater Academy of the Quechua Language, Cusco, Peru.\nDuring World War II he was a communications expert in the Royal Signal Corps and participated in the invasion of Europe. He also provided important services in Lebanon and Palestine.\nHe worked professionally in India. He arrived in Peru in 1956 and became fascinated by the country, interested in the dazzling textile art of the ancient Peruvians and in the Quipus.\nInspired by this interest, Burns looked for an Inca writing system and in 1979 published his first work, titled Secret Writings of the Incas (also Decodificaci\u00f3n de quipus), where he suggests that the pre-Hispanic Incas were in fact literate. This hypothesis has not been accepted by the scientific community. \nIn 1990 CONCYTEC (the Peruvian National Council of Science and Technology) published all of Burns' works. He died in Lima, Peru, on 24 February 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Quipu", "response": ["In 2003, while checking the geometric signs that appear on drawings of Inca dresses from the First New Chronicle and Good Government, written by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala in 1615, William Burns Glynn found a pattern that seems to decipher some words from quipus by matching knots to colors of strings."]}, {"page": "William Glynn", "response": ["* William Burns Glynn (1923\u20132014), British engineer and researcher of the pre-Columbian era in Peru"]}, {"page": "Yupana", "response": ["===William Burns Glynn===", "In 1981, the English textile engineer William Burns Glynn proposed a positional base 10 solution for the yupana of Poma de Ayala.William Burns Glynn, \"Calculation table of the Incas\", Bol.
