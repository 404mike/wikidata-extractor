In his new position, Busby built up a reputation as an intelligent player and a finer passer of the ball. In 1930, Manchester United made an enquiry about signing Busby from their cross-town rivals, but they were unable to afford the \u00a3150 fee that City demanded. By the 1931\u201332 season, Busby was firmly established in the first team, missing just one match that season. Indeed, Busby and Jackie Bray became such fixtures at wing-half that club captain Jimmy McMullan had to move to forward to keep his place in the team. In the 1930s Manchester City performed strongly in the FA Cup. They reached the semi-finals in 1932, and the final in 1933 before finally winning the tournament in 1934. However, from the second half of the 1934\u201335 season, Busby's number 4 jersey was worn by Jack Percival with increasing regularity, and Busby was sold to Liverpool for \u00a38,000 on 12 March 1936, having made more than 200 appearances for Manchester City."]}, {"page": "Pittington", "response": ["*Jack Percival (footballer, born 1913)"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Jack Percival||  || Half back || 1933\u20131946||174||8|| ||"]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Manchester City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=left| Jack Percival"]}, {"page": "John Percival (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jack Percival (footballer, born 1913) (1913\u20131979), English footballer (Manchester City)", "*Jack Percival (footballer, born 1924), English footballer (Huddersfield Town)"]}, {"page": "1937 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||4 ||  Jack Percival"]}]}}
