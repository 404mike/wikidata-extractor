Brentford won the 1932\u201333 Third Division South title, which was the first silverware of Curtis' managerial career. Curtis' Brentford finished fourth in the club's first season in the Second Division, before winning a second promotion in three seasons with the 1934\u201335 Second Division title, which secured top-flight football for the first time in the club's history. The club won a second piece of silverware during the 1934\u201335 season \u2013 the London Challenge Cup."]}, {"page": "George Cook (footballer, born 1895)", "response": ["Cook moved across London to sign for Third Division South club Brentford during the 1931 off-season. He began his time at Griffin Park well, scoring on his second appearance in a 1\u20131 draw with Thames. In a mediocre season for the club, he failed to find the net again until 30 April 1932, when he scored two goals in a 4\u20132 win over Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. With the arrival of forwards Jack Holliday and Billy Scott, Cook departed Brentford at the end of the 1931\u201332 season."]}, {"page": "James Mathieson", "response": ["Mathieson dropped to the Second Division to sign for Brentford during the 1934 off-season. He was one of a number of former Middlesbrough players recruited by Bees manager Harry Curtis in the early 1930s and he linked up with former teammates Jack Holliday, Billy Scott, Herbert Watson and Ernie Muttitt at Griffin Park. Mathieson went straight into the team and was an ever-present during the 1934\u201335 season, helping Brentford to the Second Division title and promotion to the top-flight for the first time in the club's history. He missed just one league game during the 1935\u201336 season, as the Bees finished in their highest-ever league placing of fifth in the First Division. Mathieson lost his place in goal to another Scot, Joe Crozier, during the 1937\u201338 season and departed the club at the end of the campaign. He made 129 appearances during his four years with Brentford."]}, {"page": "Billy Lane (footballer)", "response": ["After leaving White Hart Lane, Lane appeared for Leicester City (joining for \u00a32250), Reading and Brentford, where he scored 89 goals in 123 appearances. As of 2015, his record of seven league hat-tricks is second behind club record-holder Jack Holliday and his 33-goal haul in the 1929\u201330 season was a club record until Holliday broke it in 1932\u201333. Despite his excellent form for the Bees, Lane was transfer-listed by manager Harry Curtis, who needed the money from Lane's sale to fund the transfer of Middlesbrough players Jack Holliday, Bert Watson and Billy Scott. Lane signed for Watford in a \u00a31500 deal in 1932 and the following year scored a hat-trick in the Football League in under three minutes against Clapton Orient on 20 December 1933, then a record. He featured in a total of 136 matches for Watford in all competitions, scoring 77 goals and went on to have spells at Bristol City, Clapton Orient and finally Gravesend United."]}, {"page": "Cockfield F.C.", "response": ["*  Jack Holliday"]}, {"page": "Jim Towers", "response": ["Towers' most lethal season in front of goal came in 1958\u201359, scoring 37 goals in 50 appearances and finishing one goal shy of Jack Holliday's goals-in-a-season record set in the 1932\u201333 season. Towers was the top scorer in the Third Division in 1958\u201359 (with 32 goals) and the Towers-Francis partnership yielded 61 of Brentford's 83 goals for the entire season. A highlight of the season was a four-goal haul in a 6\u20130 thrashing of Southampton at The Dell on 9 March 1959. Towers' profile rose and he was the subject of bids from higher league clubs Sheffield Wednesday and Norwich City, but he turned the offers down, as due to the maximum wage he was unwilling to move for what would only have been a \u00a32 per week increase to his \u00a318 per week wages."]}, {"page": "Billy Scott (footballer, born 1907)", "response": ["Scott signed for Third Division South club Brentford in May 1932 and was joined by former Middlesbrough teammates Jack Holliday and Bert Watson at Griffin Park. Scott quickly made an impression, making 42 appearances and scoring 15 goals in the 1932\u201333 season, to help the Bees to the Third Division South title. Now playing in the Second Division, further success would follow in the 1934\u201335 season, when Scott's 18 goals helped Brentford to their second title in three seasons, to secure a place in the First Division for the first time in the club's history. Scott's 18-goal tally also included five goals in an 8\u20131 win over Barnsley on 15 December 1934, which made him the second Brentford player to achieve the feat after Jack Holliday the previous year."]}]}}
