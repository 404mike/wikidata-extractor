The castle's lavish early 19th-century state apartments were described by early 20th century art historian Hugh Roberts as \"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\".Hugh Roberts, Options Report for Windsor Castle, cited Nicolson, p. 79. Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St\u00a0George's Chapel, considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\" design.Robinson, p. 27.", "The interior of the State Apartments was mostly designed by Wyatville in the early 19th century. Wyatville intended each room to illustrate a particular architectural style and to display the matching furnishings and fine arts of the period.Nicolson, p. 79. With some alterations over the years, this concept continues to dominate the apartments. Different rooms follow the Classical, Gothic and Rococo styles, together with an element of Jacobethan in places.Nicolson, pp. 79, 172\u20133. Many of the rooms on the eastern end of the castle had to be restored following the 1992 fire, using \"equivalent restoration\" methods\u00a0\u2013 the rooms were restored so as to appear similar to their original appearance, but using modern materials and concealing modern structural improvements.Nicolson, p. 78.

Art historian Hugh Roberts has praised the State Apartments as \"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste.\" Others, such as architect Robin Nicolson and critic Hugh Pearman, have described them as \"bland\" and \"distinctly dull\".Nicolson, p. 70."]}, {"page": "1948 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 20 April \u2013 Hugh Roberts, English historian and curator"]}, {"page": "Jane, Lady Roberts", "response": ["On 13 December 1975, Priscilla Jane Stephanie Low married Sir Hugh Roberts, who was the Director of the Royal Collection and Surveyor of the Queen's Works of Art until April 2010.
