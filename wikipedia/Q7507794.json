The show was described by Graham McCann as \"the West End's biggest money-spinner for years\". Terry-Thomas compered the show as well as appearing in some of the sketches, including his own \"Technical Hitch\" routine. In 1959 he described the effect of Piccadilly Hayride on his career, saying \"This show made me overnight. I'd arrived\". Ivor Brown, writing in The Observer, remarked on the \"glorious rag of BBC modes, moods and intonations by Mr. Terry Thomas, a grand discovery\". Within three weeks of starting his run, Terry-Thomas was invited to appear at the Royal Command Performance on 4 November 1946 at the London Palladium.", "The first of the five films was Brothers in Law, in which Terry-Thomas played the spiv Alfred Green, a performance which was based on Sid Field's characterisation in Piccadilly Hayride. Roy Boulting later recounted that one short scene with Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough and Ian Carmichael took 107\u00a0takes because of Terry-Thomas's unfamiliarity with filming techniques; he initially struggled to hit his marks, or give his line and move on, while still acting. Filming the scene took two days and Boulting described it as a \"unique experience for him, and had a wonderful after-effect\". Following Brothers in Law he was cast as Romney Carlton-Ricketts in Blue Murder at St Trinian's by producers Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, before again appearing for the Boulting brothers in the cameo role of a local policeman in Happy Is the Bride. Terry-Thomas starred in two further films in 1957. The first was as Bertrand Welch in Lucky Jim, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Kingsley Amis. Although Amis thought Terry-Thomas has been \"totally miscast as Bertrand, the posturing painter and leading shit\" of the book, the critic for The Manchester Guardian considered Terry-Thomas as being \"the nearest to a complete success\" in the film, in a portrayal that \"suggests possibilities for more serious roles\". His final part of 1957 was Lord Henry Mayley in The Naked Truth; this brought him together with Peter Sellers for the first time, and the two of them appeared frequently together over the next few years in scenes in which, Graham McCann considered that each actor's performance \"highlight[ed] what was special about the other\". During one scene Terry-Thomas was dumped in a near-freezing lake, and his health was affected for some time afterwards."]}, {"page": "Margaret Lockwood", "response": ["Lockwood had a change of pace with the comedy Cardboard Cavalier (1949), with Lockwood playing Nell Gwyn opposite Sid Field.
