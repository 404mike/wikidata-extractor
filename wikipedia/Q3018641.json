Inverness also knocked other SPL teams out of cup competitions, including Motherwell and Hearts. Over the first ten years of their existence the club had been responsible for a total of 12 'shocks' and as a result had gained themselves a reputation as being \"giant killers\". On 25 February 2007, Inverness's run of cup victories over Celtic came to an end following two goals in the last two minutes of their fifth round tie at Caledonian Stadium. Having led 1\u20130 for the majority of the game thanks to a Graham Bayne goal, Steven Pressley equalised before Kenny Miller netted the winner in stoppage time. However, another victory against Celtic occurred on 16 December 2007, this time in the league, when the team came from being 2\u20130 down to win 3\u20132, with goals scored by John Rankin, David Proctor and Don Cowie."]}, {"page": "Darren Dods", "response": ["In March 2006, shortly after Craig Brewster left Inverness to become Dundee United manager, Dods was rumoured to be a target for the Tayside club, although he still had over a year left on his contract. In June, it was reported that Dods had failed to agree a new contract, with Brewster\u00a0\u2013 who had failed in a bid to sign Inverness players Ian Black and David Proctor\u00a0\u2013 still heavily linked with the player. At the start of the 2006\u201307 season, Dods had a transfer request rejected by Inverness manager Charlie Christie with Inverness subsequently rejecting bids from United of \u00a310,000 and then \u00a335,000 for the player."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in Scottish football", "response": ["*11 August 2006 \u2013 David Proctor from Inverness CT to Dundee United, \u00a335,000"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Dundee United F.C. season", "response": ["United started the league campaign with a 2\u20131 loss to Falkirk at home on the opening day of the season and then drew at Rangers, despite being 2\u20130 ahead. Goals from new signings Noel Hunt and Christian Kalvenes had put United ahead but Rangers fought back to draw in Paul Le Guen's first home match as Rangers manager. David Proctor finally arrived from Inverness CT to end weeks of protracted negotiations. Successive 0\u20130 draws against Kilmarnock (where Lee Miller's only start was marred by an early sending-off) and Dunfermline were improved by an extra-time CIS Cup win over Airdrie United and a 3\u20131 win at newly promoted St Mirren, where captain Barry Robson's 100th United match was event-filled, with two goals and a sending-off. The transfer window brought no new faces but striker Lee Miller was surprisingly allowed to leave for Aberdeen on a free transfer, although it later transpired he had been disciplined days earlier for breaking club regulations. David Fern\u00e1ndez and Paul Ritchie were also freed before the deadline, with Fernandez signing for Kilmarnock and Ritchie joining Cypriot side Omonia Nicosia.", "If 2006 ended on a high, then 2007 could not have begun any worse \u2013 a second 5\u20131 defeat to Falkirk, this time at Tannadice.

The following day, Levein confirmed Grant Smith's contract would not be renewed but Sean Dillon's move from Shelbourne was eventually completed, with the Irish full back arriving on 11 January. Prior to this, a flu epidemic had seen the Scottish Cup game against St Mirren postponed. The after-effects may have been present as United slumped to a 5\u20130 defeat at Ibrox, with Daly and Dillon both making debuts. Shortly afterwards, it was announced that Inverness captain Darren Dods had signed a pre-contract agreement to join in the summer, ending a lengthy pursuit for him that had been started by former manager Craig Brewster some months previously. The re-arranged cup match against St Mirren was full of excitement, with United throwing away a two-goal lead before David Robertson secured the win with an injury-time winner. United lost a third consecutive league match, going down 1\u20130 at Rugby Park, with David McCracken \u2013 who had earlier been told he would be leaving in the summer \u2013 absent. Shortly afterwards, Alan Archibald and David Proctor were also informed they were free to leave.

United exited the Scottish Cup, losing 1\u20130 to Inverness. David Proctor became the second player to move with special FIFA dispensation to a third club of the season (after Javier Mascherano), moving on loan to Airdrie United. On the pitch, United finally picked up a league win in 2007, completing a fourth successive victory over St Mirren this season, courtesy of Barry Robson's strike. The following week saw another clean sheet with a 0\u20130 draw at home to Hibs, only for a last-minute goal to give Inverness a 1\u20130 win up north. Off the pitch, there was plenty of excitement with a rumoured summer friendly against Barcelona, although the excitement failed to materialise onto the pitch as United were held 1\u20131 at home to Motherwell. The following weekend, Craig Levein's return to Tynecastle brought much cheer with a resounding 4\u20130 win, including Barry Robson's first senior hat-trick. United closed out March with a credible 1\u20131 draw at home to Celtic, although Barry Robson's second red card of the season spoiled Jon Daly's first goal for the club."]}, {"page": "2009 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|CB ||6|| David Proctor"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Hibernian F.C. season", "response": ["| David Proctor"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dunfermline Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["An early Paul Burns strike curled against the inside of the post and trickled along the line, somehow staying out of the goal.
