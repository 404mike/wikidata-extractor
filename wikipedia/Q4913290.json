Brentford won the 1932\u201333 Third Division South title, which was the first silverware of Curtis' managerial career. Curtis' Brentford finished fourth in the club's first season in the Second Division, before winning a second promotion in three seasons with the 1934\u201335 Second Division title, which secured top-flight football for the first time in the club's history.

Crowds at Griffin Park averaged 25,000 and in the 1937\u201338 season and Brentford led the First Division table for three months and reached the sixth round of the FA Cup for the first time. Brentford's sustained period of success was consolidated by Curtis' man-management abilities and his astuteness in the transfer market, bringing in Scottish internationals Dave McCulloch, Bobby Reid and Duncan McKenzie, Welsh internationals Idris Hopkins and Les Boulter, with Billy Scott and Les Smith going on to represent England."]}, {"page": "Bill Scott", "response": ["Bill Scott or Billy Scott may refer to:", "*Billy Scott (footballer, born 1884) (1882\u20131936), Irish footballer", "*Billy Scott (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u20131969), English footballer", "*Billy Scott (racing driver) (1948\u20132017), American race car driver", "*Billy Scott (crew chief) (born 1977), American race car driver", "*Billy Scott (singer) (1942\u20132012), American R&B musician"]}, {"page": "Les Smith (footballer, born 1918)", "response": ["Leslie George Frederick Smith (13 March 1918 \u2013 20 May 1995) was an English footballer.

He flourished under Harry Curtis' management and scored 39 goals in 35 games to send the Bees to the Second Division as 1932\u201333 Third Division South champions. With 38 league goals, he set the club record for most league goals scored in a season and most league hat-tricks in a season (five), records which as of 2018 have never been surpassed. He was also the first player to score five goals in a single game for Brentford, which he achieved in a 5\u20135 draw with Luton Town on 1 February 1933. The Bees narrowly missed out on a second successive promotion during the 1933\u201334 season and finished fourth in the Second Division, with Halliday scoring 27 goals from 41 appearances.
