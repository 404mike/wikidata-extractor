Before joining Boro for a small fee he had netted 54 goals for Arnold Town and had trials with Leeds United, Nottingham Forest, Notts County and Chesterfield. Fast and confident, he had averaged almost a goal a game for Boro reserves in two seasons since joining. Freestone scored on his full first team debut in the 3\u20131 win over Sheffield Wednesday in April 1996. His only other goal for Boro came in the League Cup against Barnet in September 1997. He was also on the pitch as a late substitute as Boro confirmed their spot in the 1997 FA Cup Final with a semi final replay victory over Chesterfield, however he was left out of the final match day squad altogether as they lost 2\u20130 to Chelsea. After a loan spell, Freestone joined Northampton in December 1997. The highlight of his time at Northampton was scoring two goals against Premier League side West Ham United in the 1998\u201399 League Cup. Freestone's brace in the first leg gave Northampton a 2\u20130 lead going into the second leg, in which West Ham were only able to muster a 1\u20130 win with a Frank Lampard goal meaning that Northampton knocked out their illustrious opponents. After leaving Northampton, Freestone had spells at Hartlepool and Cheltenham before signing for Shrewsbury Town. At Shrewsbury he failed to score in the league but did score once in the League Cup against Preston North End and once in the FA Cup against former club Cheltenham.He subsequently played for several non-League clubs, including King's Lynn, Leek Town, Ilkeston Town, Gresley Rovers, Long Eaton United, Arnold Town and Hucknall Town.He was appointed joint manager of Arnold Town alongside Martin Carruthers two games into the 2009\u201310 season.
