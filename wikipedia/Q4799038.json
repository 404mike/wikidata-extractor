The singers subsequently became semi-permanent fixtures in the Cambridge music scene under the title of Dr Mann's Festival Chorus.  However, by the early part of the 20th century the chorus was failing to attract audiences and Dr Mann resigned.  This stimulated the chorus members to reinvent themselves, which they did under the new name of the Cambridge Choral Society.  The new Society carried on the tradition of performing concerts in Cambridge until eventually, in 1924, it changed its name again, this time to the Cambridge Philharmonic Society.  Shortly after, the chorus was joined by an orchestra in a  fledgling version of the modern Society.  However the new arrangement did not last long and there followed a period of decline which was only finally arrested by the appointment of Eric Congsby, a popular local conductor, under whom the Society was reconstituted in the late 1930s to include both orchestra and chorus in a format which continues to the present day.", "*Arthur Henry Mann"]}, {"page": "List of musicians at English cathedrals", "response": ["Notable organists of Norwich Cathedral have included Zechariah Buck and Brian Runnett, and composers Thomas Morley, Heathcote Dicken Statham, Alfred R.
