He was most noted for his role as organist and director of music at King's College Chapel, Cambridge from 1876 until 1929, being the founder director of the world famous tradition of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols since its first performance in 1918. In 1888, he published his own edition of Thomas Tallis's Spem in alium. His edition, though flawed, was the first publication ever made of Tallis's famous motet in forty parts.", "link_mentions": {}}}
