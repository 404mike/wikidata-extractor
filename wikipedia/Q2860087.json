The latter was brought about by an influx of Chinese immigrants, which led to the formation of feuding triads and secret societies. Turf wars between the triads worsened, and when the Straits Settlements authorities attempted to put a stop to the triad activities in 1857, the Chinese triads came into conflict against the British-led police force as well. This culminated in the Penang Riots of 1867 in the streets of George Town, when the Kean Teik Tong, led by Khoo Thean Teik and the Red Flag, clashed against the alliance of the Ghee Hin Kongsi and the White Flag. The resulting civil unrest lasted for 10 days, before the turf war was eventually quelled by the Straits Settlements authorities under newly appointed Lieutenant-Governor Edward Anson, who were assisted by European residents and reinforcements from Singapore."]}, {"page": "Anson baronets", "response": ["*Major General Sir Edward Anson"]}, {"page": "Khoo Thean Teik", "response": ["*Edward Anson"]}, {"page": "Charles John Irving", "response": ["He was acting Lieutenant-Governor of Penang from 1879 to 1880, Resident Councillor of Penang from 1885 to 1887, Colonial Auditor General to the government of the Straits Settlements at Penang from 1867 to 1879 and acting Colonial Secretary of Straits Settlements from 1875 to 1876 under governors Sir Harry Ord, Edward Anson and Sir William Jervois."]}]}}
