In the early 1800s, Rainy became involved in sugar plantations in the Caribbean which were worked by African slaves in Demerara in Guiana. Due to extensive family connections he eventually became a full partner in the Sandbach, Tinne & Company, a Scottish-ran company which dealt in trade in the same field and was prominent in British Guiana, to the extent that the men who were ran it were called the \"Rothschilds of Demerara\" on account of their wealth and influence. After the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in the British Empire in the 1830s, Rainy became involved in the Highland Clearances. Using monies from the payout to former slave-owners following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, he purchased the islands of Raasay, Rona and Fladda from Clan MacLeod in 1846: he removed from the land twelve townships of ninety-four Gaelic Highlander families to make way for sheep farming, causing mass depopulation and displacement on the islands.", "link_mentions": {}}}
