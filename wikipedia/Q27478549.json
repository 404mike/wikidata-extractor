In the early 1800s, Rainy became involved in sugar plantations in the Caribbean which were worked by African slaves in Demerara in Guiana. Due to extensive family connections he eventually became a full partner in Sandbach, Tinne & Company, a Scottish-run company which dealt in trade in the same field and was prominent in British Guiana, to the extent that the men who ran it were called the \"Rothschilds of Demerara\" on account of their wealth and influence. After the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in the British Empire in the 1830s, Rainy became involved in the Highland Clearances. Using monies from the payout to former slave-owners following the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, he purchased the islands of Raasay, Rona and Fladda from Clan MacLeod in 1846: he removed from the land twelve townships of ninety-four Gaelic Highlander families to make way for sheep farming, causing mass depopulation and displacement on the islands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sorley MacLean", "response": ["In the English-speaking world, MacLean's best-known poem is Hallaig, a meditation on a Raasay village which had been cleared of its inhabitants. Raasay was cleared between 1852 and 1854 under George Rainy; most of its inhabitants were forced to emigrate. Many of MacLean's relatives were affected, and Hallaig was one of the villages to be depopulated. The poem was written a century later, during MacLean's time in Edinburgh, and originally published in 1954 in the Gaelic-language magazine Gairm. Beginning with the famous line, \"Time, the deer, is in the wood of Hallaig\", the poem imagines the village as it was before the Clearances, with the long-dead eternally walking through the trees. It is also filled with local names of individuals and places, which have deeper meanings to those intimately familiar with Raasay oral tradition. Unlike most of MacLean's output, Hallaig has no overt political references, and never directly mentions eviction or clearance. For this reason, it was seen as politically \"safer\" than others of MacLean's poems. Translated and promoted by Irish Nobel Prize Laureate Seamus Heaney, Hallaig achieved \"cult status\" and came to symbolize Scottish Gaelic poetry in the English-speaking imagination."]}, {"page": "Raasay", "response": ["In 1843 the last laird, John Macleod, was deep in debt and chose to emigrate to Tasmania having sold Raasay for 35,000\u00a0guineas to George Rainy. After the failure of the potato harvests in the 1840s, the new owner decided to convert as much arable land as possible to sheep farming. This required the removal of the islanders, and his solution was to ban marriage. Several townships were cleared including Hallaig and Screapadal. Two boatloads of emigrants left for Portland in Australia in 1854 as a result, and another 165 left for the same destination in 1865. The estate was then sold to Edward Wood, and conflicts between the laird and the islanders grew as he decided to turn the island over to sporting purposes. On 20 September 1862 the steamship Irishman ran aground on \"Skernataid Rock\" between Raasay and Scalpay. A  vessel Spindrift is also recorded as having become jammed under the ferry pier at the sound end of the island and broken in two by the rising tide at an unspecified date."]}, {"page": "South Rona", "response": ["...one of the most advantageous places on this coast for a fishing station. It is surrounded with numbers of banks which are daily discovered by the country people who come to fish from the mainland, which makes me think there is an inexhaustible fund of them about the island. It is likewise supplied with the best harbours at every creek, both for large vessels and small boats.  However his support for the Jacobite cause worked against him and nothing was done. In 1843 Rona and Raasay were sold to George Rainy who began clearing the native population of the latter to make way for sheep."]}, {"page": "Robert Rainy", "response": ["He was born on New Year's Day 1826 at 28 Montrose StreetGlasgow Post Office Directory 1826 in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Dr. Harry Rainy LLD (1792\u20131876) a surgeon who later served as Professor of Forensic Medicine in the University of Glasgow, and his wife Barbara Gordon (1793\u20131854).

The settlement of Hallaig depopulated between 1852 and 1854 under George Rainy and since MacLean's relatives were affected, the author decided to evoke the community of this abandoned village in his poem. It is a reflection on the nature of time and the historical impact of the Highland Clearances leaving an empty landscape populated only by the ghosts of the evicted and those forced to emigrate."]}, {"page": "Sandbach, Tinne & Company", "response": ["George Rainy, a nephew of Robertson and brother of Parker's wife, also became a partner and was the main representative in Demerara from around 1808 to 1837, when he returned to Britain.
