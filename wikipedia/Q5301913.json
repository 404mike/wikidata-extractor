The next season was much better as Morton won the Scottish Third Division Championship. The joy of a winners medal was not as sweet as it should have been for MacGregor. The reason being that in the 5th from last game of the season he suffered a broken leg and was ruled out of the game for a year. MacGregor was Morton's longest serving player having played for the club for 11 years. During that period his dedication was rewarded by chairman Douglas Rae when he gave David a three-year contract extension (when he was out injured) in 2003. He established himself as a defender in the squad.
