According to the Pulpit Commentary, there is \"no doubt\" that being Pharisee \"would rather dispose him to resist the violent counsels of the Sadducean members, and the more so as the doctrine of the Resurrection was in question.\" According to Alexander Maclaren, Gamaliel was known to be \"prudent, wise, cautious and calm, tolerant, opposed to fanaticism and violence\" and so it is unsurprising he would have given advice such as this. It is also possible Gamaliel did not want the Sanhedrin to anger the general population in Jerusalem, because many of them supported the Christians;MacArthur, John (1988).
