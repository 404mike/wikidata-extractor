He is most widely known for the invention of the Southern blot, published in 1975 and now a common laboratory procedure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Molecular biology", "response": ["The terms northern, western and eastern blotting are derived from what initially was a molecular biology joke that played on the term Southern blotting, after the technique described by Edwin Southern for the hybridisation of blotted DNA. Patricia Thomas, developer of the RNA blot which then became known as the northern blot, actually didn't use the term.", "Named after its inventor, biologist Edwin Southern, the Southern blot is a method for probing for the presence of a specific DNA sequence within a DNA sample. DNA samples before or after restriction enzyme (restriction endonuclease) digestion are separated by gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a membrane by blotting via capillary action. The membrane is then exposed to a labeled DNA probe that has a complement base sequence to the sequence on the DNA of interest. Southern blotting is less commonly used in laboratory science due to the capacity of other techniques, such as PCR, to detect specific DNA sequences from DNA samples. These blots are still used for some applications, however, such as measuring transgene copy number in transgenic mice or in the engineering of gene knockout embryonic stem cell lines."]}, {"page": "Northern blot", "response": ["With northern blotting it is possible to observe cellular control over structure and function by determining the particular gene expression rates during differentiation and morphogenesis, as well as in abnormal or diseased conditions.  Northern blotting involves the use of electrophoresis to separate RNA samples by size, and detection with a hybridization probe complementary to part of or the entire target sequence. The term 'northern blot' actually refers specifically to the capillary transfer of RNA from the electrophoresis gel to the blotting membrane. However, the entire process is commonly referred to as northern blotting.Trayhurn, P. (1996) Northern Blotting. Pro. Nutrition Soc. 55:583\u2013589.  The northern blot technique was developed in 1977 by James Alwine, David Kemp, and George Stark at Stanford University. Northern blotting takes its name from its similarity to the first blotting technique, the Southern blot, named for biologist Edwin Southern.Alberts, B., Johnson, A., Lewis, J. Raff, M., Roberts, K., Walter, P. 2008. Molecular Biology of the Cell, 5th ed. Garland Science, Taylor & Francis Group, NY, pp 538\u2013539.  The major difference is that RNA, rather than DNA, is analyzed in the northern blot."]}, {"page": "Southern blot", "response": ["The method is named after the British biologist Edwin Southern, who first published it in 1975.  Other blotting  methods (i.e., western blot, northern blot, eastern blot, southwestern blot) that employ similar principles, but using RNA or protein, have later been named in reference to Edwin Southern's name. As the label is  eponymous, Southern is capitalised, as is conventional of proper nouns. The names for other blotting methods may follow this convention, by analogy."]}, {"page": "Alec Jeffreys", "response": ["* 2005 \u2013 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research, jointly with Edwin Southern of the University of Oxford."]}, {"page": "List of inventors", "response": ["* Edwin Southern (born 1938), U.S. \u2013 Southern blot (molecular biology)"]}, {"page": "Western blot", "response": ["The name western blot is a play on the Southern blot, a technique for DNA detection named after its inventor, English biologist Edwin Southern. Similarly, detection of RNA is termed as northern blot. The term \"western blot\" was given by W. Neal Burnette in 1981, although the method itself originated in 1979 in the laboratory of Harry Towbin at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel, Switzerland.
