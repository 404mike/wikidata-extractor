Since her marriage in 1999 she has been known as Tiggy Pettifer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diana, Princess of Wales", "response": ["Although she blamed Camilla Parker Bowles for her marital troubles, Diana began to believe her husband had also been involved in other affairs. In October 1993, Diana wrote to her butler Paul Burrell, telling him that she believed her husband was now in love with his personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke\u2014who was also his sons' former nanny\u2014and was planning to have her killed \"to make the path clear for him to marry Tiggy\". Legge-Bourke had been hired by Charles as a young companion for his sons while they were in his care, and Diana was resentful of Legge-Bourke and her relationship with the young princes. Prince Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby on 29 June 1994. In the interview, he said he had rekindled his relationship with Camilla in 1986 only after his marriage to Diana had \"irretrievably broken down\".", "The interview proved to be the tipping point. On 20 December, Buckingham Palace announced that the Queen had sent letters to Charles and Diana, advising them to divorce. The Queen's move was backed by the Prime Minister and by senior Privy Counsellors, and, according to the BBC, was decided after two weeks of talks. Charles formally agreed to the divorce in a written statement soon after. In February 1996, Diana announced her agreement after negotiations with Charles and representatives of the Queen, irritating Buckingham Palace by issuing her own announcement of the divorce agreement and its terms. In July 1996, the couple agreed on the terms of their divorce. This followed shortly after Diana's accusation that Charles's personal assistant Tiggy Legge-Bourke had aborted his child, after which Legge-Bourke instructed her attorney Peter Carter-Ruck to demand an apology. Diana's private secretary Patrick Jephson resigned shortly before the story broke, later writing that she had \"exulted in accusing Legge-Bourke of having had an abortion\". The rumours of Legge-Bourke's alleged abortion were apparently spread by Martin Bashir as a means to gain his Panorama interview with the princess."]}, {"page": "Martin Bashir", "response": ["On 4 March 2021, the Metropolitan Police announced that they would not begin a criminal investigation into the allegations after a \"detailed assessment\" and consultation with the Metropolitan police lawyers, independent counsel and the Crown Prosecution Service. Later that month Bashir told the BBC inquiry that he was not responsible for spreading smears about the royal family to convince the princess to sit for the interview, and it was probably Diana herself who was the source of those claims. Among the smears were allegations of Prince Edward being treated for AIDS, the Queen suffering from cardiac problems and her intention to abdicate, and that the Prince of Wales was having an affair with his children's nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Bashir argued that bringing up such allegations in front of Diana would have exposed him as a \"complete fantasist\" and narrowed down the chance of doing any interviews with her. Bashir added that Diana had revealed to him that she spoke with mystics and clairvoyants, who could have been the source of the false information given to her."]}, {"page": "Nanny", "response": ["* Tiggy Legge-Bourke MVO (born 1965), nanny to Prince William and Prince Harry"]}, {"page": "Peter Carter-Ruck", "response": ["In December 1995, Carter-Ruck acted for the royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke in the matter of an allegation against her by Diana, Princess of Wales, that she had aborted Prince Charles's child."]}, {"page": "Crickhowell", "response": ["The Glanusk Park estate was the childhood home of the former royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who still lives near the town as proprietor of T\u0177'r Chanter bed and breakfast lodgings."]}, {"page": "Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire", "response": ["Cousins Tiggy and Eleanor Legge-Bourke are his descendants through his fifth daughter; they are both granddaughters of politician Sir Harry Legge-Bourke, only son of Lt.
