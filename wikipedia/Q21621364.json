Six days later, on 30 August 2016, he was given the captaincy for the first time for the whole game, in a 3\u20130 loss against Crewe Alexandra. He started every match since the start of the season until he was suspended in late-November. After returning to the first team from suspension, Pearson scored again on 2 January 2017, as well as, setting up one of the goals, in a 2\u20132 draw against Hartlepool United. Several weeks later, however, he was sent-off in \"the 12th minute when defender Matty Pearson's challenge on Macaulay Gillesphey was judged high and dangerous by referee Chris Sarginson\", in a 1\u20131 draw against Carlisle United on 21 January 2017.
