This attack had more clout than most: it was dedicated to John Lambert, a top military figure, and was launched during Barebone's Parliament, when radical change seemed on the cards. Wilkins (as NS) provided an open letter to Ward; and Ward (as HD, also taking the final letters of his name therefore) replied at greater length. Wilkins makes two main points: first, Webster is not addressing the actual state of the universities, which were not as wedded to old scholastic ways, Aristotle, and Galen, as he said; and secondly Webster's mixture of commended authors, without fuller understanding of the topics, really was foolish.  In this approach Wilkins had to back away somewhat from his writings of the late 1630s and early 1640s.  He made light of this in the way of pointing to Alexander Ross, a very conservative Aristotelian who had attacked his own astronomical works, as a more suitable target for Webster.  This exchange was part of the process of the new experimental philosophers throwing off their associations with occultists and radicals."]}, {"page": "Joseph Glanvill", "response": ["Saducismus Triumphatus was also translated into German in 1701.Joseph Glanvill, Saducismus Triumphatus, Oder Vollkommener und klarer Bewei\u00df Von Hexen und Gespenstern Oder Geister-Erscheinungen (Hamburg: Liebernickel, 1701).
