The band's image also changed as the members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing, with Page taking the lead on the flamboyant appearance by wearing a glittering moon-and-stars outfit. Led Zeppelin changed their show by using things such as lasers, professional light shows and mirror balls. They began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720 (nicknamed the Starship), rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known colloquially as the \"Riot House\"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John Bonham riding a motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House, while another involved the destruction of a room in the Tokyo Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life. Although Led Zeppelin developed a reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest that these tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, \"[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned many stories, but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour\"."]}, {"page": "Led Zeppelin (album)", "response": ["However, press reaction to the album was not entirely negative. In Britain the album received a glowing review in Melody Maker. Chris Welch wrote, in a review titled \"Jimmy Page triumphsLed Zeppelin is a gas!\": \"their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands\". In Oz, Felix Dennis regarded it as one of those rare albums that \"defies immediate classification or description, simply because it's so obviously a turning point in rock music that only time proves capable of shifting it into eventual perspective\". In comparing the record to their follow-up Led Zeppelin II, Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice that the debut was \"subtler and more ambitious musically\", and not as good, \"because subtlety defeated the effect. Musicianship, in other words, was really incidental to such music, but the music did have real strength and validity: a combination of showmanship and overwhelming physical force.\""]}, {"page": "Genesis (band)", "response": ["The album features the 23-minute track \"Supper's Ready\", a suite of various musical segments. The track included an opening acoustic piece, a Gabriel-penned song called \"Willow Farm\", and a piece derived from a jam by Banks, Rutherford and Collins called \"Apocalypse in 9/8\". Other songs were the science-fiction-themed \"Watcher of the Skies\" and the property-development-themed \"Get 'Em Out by Friday\". Foxtrot was released in October 1972 and reached No. 12 in the UK. It fared even better in Italy, where it went to No. 1. Foxtrot was well received by critics. Chris Welch of Melody Maker thought Foxtrot was \"a milestone in the group's career\", \"an important point of development in British group music\", and that Genesis had reached \"a creative peak\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought Foxtrot marked the first time \"Genesis attacked like a rock band, playing with a visceral power\".", "...And Then There Were Three... was released in March 1978. It received some mixed reviews from critics at the time owing to the album only containing short songs, which excited new fans but disillusioned those who had been used to the band's previous work. Chris Welch wrote a positive review in Melody Maker, citing a \"remarkably powerful\" album. It was a commercial success and peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US. \"Follow You Follow Me\" was released as its lead single and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 23 in the US, their highest charting single in both countries since their formation. Its success introduced the band to a new audience, including a larger female interest, helped by its music video airing on Top of the Pops. Its success caused some fans to accuse the group of selling out to more commercial music. A follow-up single, \"Many Too Many\", was less successful, for it had already appeared on the album."]}, {"page": "Beatles for Sale", "response": ["The album received favourable reviews in the UK musical press.

They returned to England, and Anderson did some rewriting before Jethro Tull quickly recorded and released A Passion Play (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like Thick as a Brick, A Passion Play contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond.  A Passion Play sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of Melody Maker.

More impressed, Derek Johnson of the NME described \"Revolution\" as \"unashamed rock 'n' roll\" but \"a cut above the average rock disc, particularly in the thoughtful and highly topical lyric\", and \"a track that literally shimmers with excitement and awareness\". Johnson concluded by stating that the two sides \"prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Beatles are still streets ahead of their rivals\". Cash Boxs reviewer described \"Revolution\" as \"straight-out rock with lyrical flavor of a pre-Revolver feel and fifties-rock instrumentation\", adding: \"More commercial at first few hearings, but hardly able to stand up against 'Hey Jude.'\""]}, {"page": "Jon Anderson", "response": ["After returning to London in March 1968, Anderson met Jack Barrie, owner of the La Chasse drinking club in Soho who befriended the rest of the Warriors after they had relocated to the city. With no money or accommodation, Barrie allowed Anderson and Warriors keyboardist and vocals Brian Chatton to stay with him. Anderson helped out by working at La Chasse; during this time he got talking to Paul Korda, a producer for EMI Records who took him on to sing several demos. During the search for material to record, Barrie got in touch with Elton John and Bernie Taupin of DJM Records to put some music together, but felt Anderson did not like much of it. Meanwhile, Anderson travelled to the Netherlands to join Les Crunches, a band he met in London, but promptly returned when he found out some of his demos were to be released as singles by Parlophone Records. Released under his pseudonym Hans Christian, the first, an orchestrated cover of \"Never My Love\" by the Association with \"All of the Time\" on its B-side, received a positive reception from New Musical Express and Chris Welch for Melody Maker who wrote in March 1968, \"A blockbuster of a hit from a young fairy tale teller with an emotion packed voice.\" Anderson's second single, \"(The Autobiography of) Mississippi Hobo\"/\"Sonata of Love\", was released two months later; neither song was successful. Barrie and Korda then took Anderson to see local group the Gun and together rehearsed for well received gigs at the UFO and Marquee clubs in London, the latter as an opener for the Who, which led to several gig offers. However, the rest of the group believed they could reach success without a lead vocalist and sacked Anderson."]}, {"page": "Hey Jude", "response": ["In his contemporary review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME wrote: \"The intriguing features of 'Hey Jude' are its extreme length and the 40-piece orchestral accompaniment \u2013 and personally I would have preferred it without either!\" While he viewed the track overall as \"a beautiful, compelling song\", and the first three minutes as \"absolutely sensational\", Johnson rued the long coda's \"vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four-bar chorus\". Johnson nevertheless concluded that \"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution\" \"prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Beatles are still streets ahead of their rivals\". Chris Welch of Melody Maker said he had initially been unimpressed, but came to greatly admire \"Hey Jude\" for its \"slow, heavy, piano-ridden beat, sensuous, soulful vocals and nice thumpy drums\". He added that the track would have benefited from being edited in length, as the climactic ending was \"a couple of minutes too long\"."]}, {"page": "Tommy (The Who album)", "response": ["Recording at IBC was slow, due to a lack of a full plot and a full selection of songs. The group hoped that the album would be ready by Christmas, but sessions dragged on. Melody Makers Chris Welch visited IBC studios in November and while he was impressed with the working environment and the material, the project still did not have a title and there was no coherent plotline. The Who's US record company, Decca Records, got so impatient waiting for new product that they released the compilation album Magic Bus: The Who on Tour which received a scathing review from Greil Marcus in Rolling Stone over its poor selection of material and misleading name (as the album contained studio recordings and was not live).", "For Melody Maker, Chris Welch went to the album's press launch show at Ronnie Scott's and although the volume left his ears ringing for 20 hours, he concluded \"we wanted more.\" Disc and Music Echo ran a front-page headline saying \"Who's Tommy: A Masterpiece\". Critics and fans were confused by the storyline, but Kit Lambert pointed out this made Tommy no less confusing than the operas of Richard Wagner or Giacomo Puccini a century earlier. In a 1969 column for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said that, apart from the Mothers of Invention's We're Only in It for the Money, Tommy is the first successful \"extended work\" in rock music, but Townshend's parodic side is more \"profound and equivocal\" than Frank Zappa. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that he is determined to \"give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity\". Albert Goldman, writing in Life magazine, said that the Who play through \"all the kinky complications\" of the narrative in a hard rock style that is the antithesis of most contemporary \"serious\" rock. Goldman asserted that, based on innovation, performance, and \"sheer power\", Tommy surpasses anything else in studio-recorded rock. Robert Christgau named Tommy the best album of 1969 in his year-end list for Jazz & Pop magazine."]}, {"page": "Quadrophenia", "response": ["Critical reaction to Quadrophenia was positive. Melody Makers Chris Welch wrote \"rarely have a group succeeded in distilling their essence and embracing a motif as convincingly\", while Charles Shaar Murray described the album in New Musical Express as the \"most rewarding musical experience of the year\". Reaction in the US was generally positive, though Dave Marsh, writing in Creem gave a more critical response. Lenny Kaye, wrote in Rolling Stone that \"the Who as a whole have never sounded better\" but added, \"on its own terms, Quadrophenia falls short of the mark\". In a year-end top albums list for Newsday, Robert Christgau ranked it seventh, and found it exemplary of how 1973's best records \"fail to reward casual attention. They demand concentration, just like museum and textbook art.\""]}, {"page": "Vivian Stanshall", "response": ["Writing in The Independent after Stanshall's death, Chris Welch wrote: \"Seen by some as a wild eccentric, and a powerful personality who could be both charming and intimidating, Stanshall was perhaps too large a figure even for the music business to handle. ... He needed a producer to channel his energies, but always wanted to remain his own boss, having suffered too many perceived indignities in his early experience of the music business.\" He was described by Neil Innes as \"a national treasure\"."]}, {"page": "Thick as a Brick", "response": ["Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of Melody Maker praised the musicianship of the band and Anderson's flute playing, writing also that \"the joke at the expense of a local newspaper wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of Thick\"; he described the music as a creative effort where \"the ideas flow in super abundance\" but that \"needs time to absorb\" and \"heard out of context of their highly visual stage act\u00a0... does not have such immediate appeal\". Tony Tyler in his review for New Musical Express generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album's possible success. He called Thick as a Brick \"Jethro Tull's own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of Tommy\" and \"an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in '70s Britain\". Ben Gerson in Rolling Stone magazine called Thick as a Brick \"one of rock's most sophisticated and ground-breaking products\". Going further, the reviewer stated: \"Martin Barre's guitar and John Evan's keyboards especially shine, and Ian's singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not Thick As A Brick is an isolated experiment, it is nice to know that someone in rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace.\" Rolling Stone's Alan Niester gave it 2 out of 5 stars in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, judging it had \"relatively undifferentiated movements\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it \"the usual shit\" from the band: \"rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)\"."]}, {"page": "A Passion Play", "response": ["Upon its original release, it received generally negative reviews. Stephen Holden, writing for Rolling Stone, was broadly negative, saying that the album \"strangles under the tonnage of its pretensions \u2014 a jumble of anarchic, childishly precocious gestures that are intellectually and emotionally faithless to any idea other than their own esoteric non-logic\"; feeling, overall, that, despite the band being \"truly virtuosic in the manner of a polished chamber ensemble\" and some moments, such as \"those interludes that feature Anderson\u2019s extraordinary flute playing\" and two \"short pastoral sections\" that were \"especially lovely\"   the album was \"expensive, tedious nonsense\". New Musical Express considered the album as \"the fall\" of Jethro Tull. Even Chris Welch of Melody Maker had a bad impression, stating \"Music must touch the soul. A Passion Play rattles with emptiness\". Lester Bangs, writing for Creem Magazine, stated that he became \"totally bamboozled\" after hearing the album.

Welch's review for Melody Maker published a month later included his thoughts on such long concept albums\u2013\"A few golden miraculous notes and some choice pithy words are worth all the clutter and verbiage\"\u2013and he called the album a \"white elephant\". For New Musical Express, Barbara Charone wrote highly of the collection.

In one instance, Welch arrived at the studio to hear a preview of a completed passage that took several days of round-the-clock work to produce.

One of the early British music magazines, Melody Maker, complained in 1967 about how \"newspapers and magazines are continually hammering [i.e., attacking] pop music\". From 1964, Melody Maker led its rival publications in terms of approaching music and musicians as a subject for serious study rather than merely entertainment. Staff reporters such as Chris Welch and Ray Coleman applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of rock critics. Among Britain's broadsheet newspapers, pop music gained exposure in the arts section of The Times when William Mann, the paper's classical music critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963. In early 1965, The Observer, the country's highbrow Sunday newspaper, signalled a reversal of the establishment's cultural snobbery towards pop music by appointing George Melly as its \"critic of pop culture\".

Steve Peacock reviewed the album and a live performance of it for Sounds magazine using the headlines \"Wishy washy tales from the deep\" and \"Close to boredom\". Critic and Yes biographer Chris Welch reviewed the album for Melody Maker and wrote: \"It is a fragmented masterpiece, assembled with loving care and long hours in the studio. Brilliant in patches, but often taking far too long to make its various points, and curiously lacking in warmth or personal expression\". He thought \"Ritual\" brought the \"first enjoyable moments\" of the entire album, \"where Alan's driving drums have something to grip on to and the lyrics of la la la speak volumes. But even this cannot last long and cohesion is lost once more to the gods of drab self-indulgence.\" For New Musical Express, Steve Clarke, who had listened to the album for two months and saw the band perform the album live once, declared the album \"a great disappointment\", coming from the strength of Close to the Edge and notes the \"colour and excitement\" that the group usually puts on their albums was missing. He thought Wakeman's abilities were restricted, and a lack of \"positive construction\" in the music which too often loses itself to \"a wash of synthetic sounds\". Howe's guitar adopts the same tone as Wakeman's keyboards, which bored Clarke, but Anderson was praised in helping carry the music through with his \"frail, pure and at times very beautiful\" voice.

Others were flown in from the US and Germany. Anderson had become a fan of Vangelis and visited his Paris flat when Yes were in town performing Tales from Topographic Oceans. Vangelis agreed to an audition, but Yes found he was non-committal to the role and too strong a personality for a group. Phil Carson, an Atlantic Records manager and associate of the band, said that Vangelis \"tried out Yes but it didn't really gel ... Vangelis wouldn't get on a plane and wouldn't fly anywhere and Yes were about to go on tour.\" The possibility of Vangelis joining the band was also affected by a rejection from the Musicians Union. Soon after, Melody Maker reporter and band biographer Chris Welch suggested that the band try Patrick Moraz, a Swiss musician and film composer with a background in jazz and classical music, and a member of the progressive and jazz fusion trio Refugee. Less than a week later, Moraz accepted an invitation from Brian Lane, the band's manager, to an audition.

If this already controversial single gets the airplay, it's going to be a huge hit.\" Despite this, the single failed to sell in the US, peaking at 124, which Pitt attributed to Oberman's use of the word \"controversial\" in his statement, causing it to be banned by multiple US radio stations."]}, {"page": "Nursery Cryme", "response": ["\"Seven Stones\" was conceived by Banks who used what Rutherford described as \"his big, schmaltzy, music hall chords [that] he loved.\" Melody Maker reporter Chris Welch described the song as \"strangely mournful and inconclusive.\" He theorised that the old man addressed in the lyric is expressing his \"profound belief that the secret of success and good fortune is based purely on random events and chance.\""]}, {"page": "Foxtrot (album)", "response": ["\"Time Table\" features a romantic theme that yearns for tradition, decency, and an age of kings and queens that is banished by war and conflict. Written by Banks, he presented the song as a complete piece and had the band perform it. Melody Makers Chris Welch described the track as light relief and a \"gentle but stirring pop song\" after the \"pounding excitement\" of \"Watcher of the Skies\". Gabriel biographer Daryl Easlea considered the song the most overlooked from the Gabriel-era of the band's history with its \"sweet and touching\" flavour and its resemblance to Genesis songs of the late 1970s."]}, {"page": "Selling England by the Pound", "response": ["\"The Battle of Epping Forest\" was inspired by a news story that Gabriel had read several years previously about the territorial battles by two rival gangs in the East End of London that would fight in Epping Forest. He placed an advertisement in The Times and looked through library archives in attempt to find more about the story, but was unable to find any further information, so he created his own fictional characters, including \"Liquid Len\", \"Harold Demure\" and \"The Bethnal Green Butcher\". Upon hearing a rehearsal take of the song in July 1973, reporter Chris Welch wrote: \"'The 'Battle' has a catchy march theme with typical Genesis drum and bass lines, clean and precise\". The lyrics have since been praised for their humour and wit, but the band later said they did not gel well with the music and made the piece complicated for the sake of being so. Gabriel thought its ending, which had each gang settling the issue over the toss of a coin, tied up the story well but is too much of an anti-climax."]}, {"page": "Omnibus Press", "response": ["Among the rock and pop writers whose work has been published by Omnibus over the years are Richard Williams, Chris Welch, Peter Dogget, Patrick Humphries, David Sinclair and Everett True (UK) and Dave Marsh, Paul Williams, Nelson George, Jerry Hopkins, David Ritz and Danny Sugerman (US)."]}, {"page": "Seconds Out", "response": ["Hugh Fielder of Sounds gave the album five stars out of five. Melody Maker reporter Chris Welch, with assistance from Bob Gallagher, also praised the album. Rolling Stone praised the contemporary incarnation of the band, noting they had \"less reliance on theatrics\" than before Peter Gabriel's departure, \"and an added dollop of jazz-rock inclinations.\""]}, {"page": "Abbey Road", "response": ["Conversely, Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker: \"the truth is, their latest LP is just a natural born gas, entirely free of pretension, deep meanings or symbolism ... While production is simple compared to past intricacies, it is still extremely sophisticated and inventive.\" Available at Rock's Backpages  (subscription required). Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times found the album \"refreshingly terse and unpretentious\", and although he lamented the band's \"cod-1920s jokes (Maxwell's Silver Hammer) and ... Ringo's obligatory nursery arias (Octopus's Garden)\", he considered that Abbey Road \"touches higher peaks than did their last album\".Fricke, David (2003). \"Road to Nowhere\". In Mojo: The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition. London: Emap. p. 112. John Mendelsohn, writing for Rolling Stone, called it \"breathtakingly recorded\" and praised side two especially, equating it to \"the whole of Sgt. Pepper\" and stating, \"That the Beatles can unify seemingly countless musical fragments and lyrical doodlings into a uniformly wonderful suite\u00a0... seems potent testimony that no, they've far from lost it, and no, they haven't stopped trying.\""]}]}}
