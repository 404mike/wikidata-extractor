Arthur Peppercorn's post-war LNER Pacifics also incorporated them, including preserved A2 532 Blue Peter, and the recreated A1 Tornado. Originally Kylchap exhausts were expensive and rarely used because the design was patented and subject to a licence fee but, after the patent expired, many more locomotives were retrofitted, including all the remaining A3 and A4 class, as the pure manufacturing cost was relatively low.  The last steam express passenger locomotive built in Britain, Duke of Gloucester, was not fitted with a Kylchap exhaust in service, despite plans to fit one, but one was fitted in preservation when it was realised that poor draughting had been one of the biggest reasons behind its poor performance in its service days. A Kylchap exhaust is fitted to the Stainmore Railway company industrial 0-4-0st locomotive 'F C Tingey', found at Kirkby Stephen East station. These exhausts were also fitted to some British-built export locomotives, primarily Garratts for Africa."]}, {"page": "BR Standard Class 6", "response": ["After initial running-in, E.S.Cox was quoted as discerning a distinct \"woolliness\" in their steaming, and although they missed their appointment at the Rugby Locomotive Testing Station due to late completion, some modifications were carried out, most notably to the diameter of the blastpipe, resulting in better steaming and increased power.Cox, E. S.: British Railways Standard Locomotives, p. 64  Initially, the return cranks on the main driving wheels were of LNER block-type as seen on Arthur Peppercorn's A1s and A2s, but this was changed to the simpler LMS four-stud fitting.

Initially the return cranks on the main driving wheels were of LNER block type, as seen on Arthur Peppercorn's A1s and A2s, but this was changed to the simpler LMS four-stud fitting. This was the result of a problem of overheating bearings within the cranks, and difficulty in removing the LNER-type casings. 70035\u201370039 were built with roller bearings on the leading and trailing coupled axles only and plain bearings on the remaining axles, whilst 70040\u201370049 were built with plain bearings throughout.

Forty-nine original Peppercorn Class A1s were built to the design of Arthur Peppercorn (who was the last Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the LNER) during the early British Railways era, but all were scrapped with the discontinuation of steam, with none of the original production run surviving into preservation. In 2008, a brand new 50th Peppercorn A1 locomotive, 60163 Tornado, was completed.", "Most of the former LNER Class A1 locomotives designed by Sir Nigel Gresley had been rebuilt as LNER Class A3 locomotives prior to this class being conceived. The few straggling LNER Class A1 locomotives that remained unrebuilt during the tenure of Peppercorn's predecessor, Edward Thompson, were redesignated by him as Class A10s in preparation for the construction of his new Class A1 locomotives. Thompson rebuilt the pioneer LNER pacific Great Northern in 1945; originally this was the new Class A1, but the rebuild was not repeated.  Instead, initiated by Thompson but largely taken forward by his successor Arthur Peppercorn, Great Northern was designated Class A1/1, and a new class of Peppercorn A1s ordered."]}, {"page": "LNER Gresley Classes A1 and A3", "response": ["Along with all the Gresley 3-cylinder types, the Pacifics suffered from low wartime maintenance standards, conditions for which they had not been designed. Gresley's sudden death in 1941 and an unsympathetic successor, Edward Thompson, did not help matters in this respect. In 1945 Thompson took the opportunity to rebuild the first of Gresley's A1 Pacifics, Great Northern, to the LNER Class A1/1 specification with divided drive and separate valve gear for the inside cylinder.  Thompson intended to rebuild to this configuration all the Gresley A1s that had not been converted to A3 standard; in the meantime the remaining Gresley A1s were reclassified as A10s.  The rebuilding of these locomotives as A1/1 never happened.  Instead, the conversion to A3 standard continued.

Peppercorn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Peppercorn"]}, {"page": "Edward Thompson (engineer)", "response": ["Gresley's passing was very unexpected, and the LNER had no immediate successor in mind. The LNER board of directors first requested permission from the Southern Railway to approach their CME, O.V.S. Bulleid, who had been Gresley's assistant until joining the Southern four years previously. Permission was granted, but he declined the offer. J.F. Harrison, the man later largely responsible for the design of No.71000 \"Duke of Gloucester\", was the popular choice. However, at 42 years old, it was considered inappropriate for someone so young to take the post. The LNER board then turned to Arthur Peppercorn for the CME role, but Thompson held seniority amongst other LNER officials and used this political experience to sidestep Peppercorn and take the title of CME.", "Thompson criticised many of Gresley's practices, but equivalent comment can be made about many of Thompson's designs. Upon taking up his post, Thompson tried to convince the LNER hierarchy of the need to rebuild the Gresley Pacific and Mikado classes. The Directors of the LNER, having witnessed a Gresley A4 take the World Speed Record for steam, were sceptical about this, so Thompson researched as many middle big-end bearing failures on the LNER as he could find, attributing them to the design of the conjugated motion, even garnering outside opinion from the LMS. Despite roundly criticizing the Gresley motion, his Pacific rebuilds were not the best designs. They retained three cylinders, but with divided drive and 3 independent sets of Walschaerts valve gear. Thompson attached great importance to having the connecting rods equal in length, which was in fact unnecessary. As a result, the outside cylinders were placed behind the front bogie with the inside cylinder well forward. This gave the engine an unnecessarily long wheelbase, created long exhaust channels, generated vibration and encouraged flexing and fracture of the locomotive frames. All of his Pacifics were particularly prone to wheel slip owing to the high power output of the engine in relation to the adhesion factor. The engines were effective, and the design had materially less maintenance demand on the centre valve gear than the conjugated locomotives, but the positives were outweighed by the problems, which were of such significance that Thompson's engines were withdrawn and scrapped before many of their Gresley-designed forerunners. The Thompson Pacifics were ultimately more maintenance-intensive overall than the Gresley engines. Thompson omitted the \"banjo dome\" that had featured on the Gresley Pacifics since 1928. However, Thompson's successor, Arthur Peppercorn, revived the feature on the remaining batches of LNER Pacifics.", "Shortly before Thompson's retirement the LNER was short of express passenger locomotives so Thompson initiated plans for a new Pacific design, which he intended to be based on the rebuilt Great Northern. However the LNER design office, having received reports of Great Northern's performance in service, delayed completing the design of  the locomotive until Thompson had retired. Even then Thompson laid down a strict set of guidelines for the new locos. The new class (LNER Class A1) was finally designed under Thompson's successor Arthur Peppercorn, who disregarded almost all of Thompson's guidelines."]}]}}
