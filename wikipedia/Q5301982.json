He began his broadcasting career with the BBC European Service (now the World Service) in 1946 and later worked as an announcer and newsreader on the Home Service and the Third Programme. He is perhaps best known as the formal announcer on Beyond Our Ken (1958\u20131964), its more famous successor Round the Horne (1965\u20131968) and the short-lived Stop Messing About (1969\u20131970), where his \"BBC accent\" was used to comic effect. Listeners remember him for advertising Dobbiroids (a fictional product for horses) and the huge number of na\u00efve sound effects he made to assist in the development of humorous and often bizarre plots. Smith's performance of \"Nobody Loves a Fairy When She's Forty\" is one of the best-remembered moments of Round the Horne. Many of his roles were portrayals of inanimate objects, e.g., volcanoes. \"..and I, Douglas Smith, play the part of the volcano\", and memorably, \"...and I, Douglas Smith, in my most taxing role to date, play the part of the world.\" (spoof on 'Around the World in 80 Days').\nA native of Croydon, he died aged 48 in Kingston upon Thames.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Round the Horne", "response": ["Horne's supporting cast comprised Kenneth Williams, Hugh Paddick, Betty Marsden and, in the first three series, Bill Pertwee. The announcer was Douglas Smith, who also took part in the sketches. All except the last series featured music by Edwin Braden, played by the band \"the Hornblowers\", with a song in the middle of each show performed by the close-harmony singing group the Fraser Hayes Four; in the fourth series, the music was by Max Harris with a smaller group of players than the earlier series.", "The first episode of Round the Horne was broadcast on the Light Programme on 7 March 1965. It was described in Radio Times as \"Five characters in search of the authors\". The series consisted of 16 episodes and ran to 20 June 1965. The programme was produced by John Simmonds and included music from the Fraser Hayes Four and the studio orchestra, \"the Hornblowers\", conducted by Paul Fenoulhet; from episode six, Fenoulhet was replaced by Edwin Braden. Douglas Smith, an announcer and newsreader on the Home Service and the Third Programme, was used as the programme's announcer, but was given a larger role as the series progressed; he ended up advertising spoof products and giving human sound effects in addition to his normal role.", "===Douglas Smith===", "At the start of the first series of Round the Horne Douglas Smith took the traditional role of a BBC announcer on comedy shows, introducing the programme and its component parts and reading the credits at the end. As the show developed, the writers gave him more to do. In the second series Smith continually interrupts the programme to promote \"Dobbiroids Magic Rejuvenators\" (from \"the makers of Dobbins Medical Cummerbunds for horses\") and Dobbimist horse deodorant for UFO (\"under fetlock odour\"). In the third and fourth series he is included in the movie spoofs, playing a range of roles including a rumbling volcano:", ":Horne: ...

Hatch's announcements were frequently lampooned or interrupted by other cast members. In the 25th Anniversary special, Hatch invited the audience to join them again in 25 years time - ironically, by 2014 Hatch, who died in 2007, was the only cast member to have died."]}, {"page": "Beyond Our Ken", "response": ["Beyond Our Ken (1958\u201364) was a radio comedy programme, the predecessor to Round the Horne (1965\u201368).
