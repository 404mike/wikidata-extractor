From the start the visitors looked like they would get goals with Dunfermline's defence being torn apart, especially by a lively Chris Humphrey. The breakthrough finally came when Keith Lasley and Michael Higdon combined with Higdon curling in from the edge of the area. Tom Hateley nearly made it two a few minutes later with a free-kick hitting the post. But it was only a short respite for Dunfermline as Motherwell scored again, Jamie Murphy strolled past Gary Mason and was given time to hit a 20-yard shot which heavily deflected off Alex Keddie and into the net. In the second half things hadn't changed with Motherwell dominating and when Chris Humphrey was allowed to cut inside into the box his shot clipped the post and into the net. Dunfermline then started to attack, pushing Motherwell back, and were rewarded when David Graham's 25-yard shot flicked off Joe Cardle and into the net, with Cardle claiming the goal. Cardle then bagged another as he cut into the box and his shot deflected off Stephen Craigan and past the helpless keeper. With two minutes to go Dunfermline pushed forward, but were counter-attacked and Higdon's late finish from a cross by Nicky Law finished the game.
