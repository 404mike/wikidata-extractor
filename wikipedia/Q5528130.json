Crooks, \"Entropy production fluctuation theorem and the nonequilibrium work relation for free energy differences\", Physical Review E, 60, 2721 (1999) is an equation in statistical mechanics that relates the work done on a system during a non-equilibrium transformation to the free energy difference between the final and the initial state of the transformation. During the non-equilibrium transformation the system is at constant volume and in contact with a heat reservoir. The CFT is named after the chemist Gavin E. Crooks (then at University of California, Berkeley) who discovered it in 1998."]}, {"page": "Gavin Crooks", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gavin E.
