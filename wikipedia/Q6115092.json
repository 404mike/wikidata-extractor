He took 7/34 for Worcestershire Second XI against Leicestershire II in June 2008,\nand scored 88 for Shropshire against Wales Minor Counties in August of the same year.\nBetween these two feats, in July, he had appeared for Shropshire in the final of the Resource Bank Twenty20 Cup, which they lost to a star-studded Lashings World XI side despite Shantry's 3/11.Shantry made his senior debut for Worcestershire in a Pro40 match against Essex at Colchester on 23 August 2009, taking the wicket of Ravi Bopara and not batting.\nTwo days later, he made his maiden appearance in first-class cricket when he was selected for Worcestershire's County Championship clash with Nottinghamshire at New Road. In a drawn game, Shantry claimed the wickets of Bilal Shafayat and Mark Ealham, but was lbw for nought in his only innings.\nHe retained his place in the side in both one-day and four-day cricket, and so his club cricket appearances, now for Walsall, became less frequent.Shantry pressed his claims for a regular place in the side in his first game of the 2010 season, a non-first-class warm-up match against Bradford/Leeds UCCE. He claimed 5\u201318 in the first innings, and opened the bowling in the second innings, taking a wicket with the first ball of the innings and finishing with 7\u201347, to complete a match haul of 12 wickets for 65. Worcestershire went on to win the game.In September 2014, he scored his maiden first-class century (and took ten wickets in a first-class match for the first time) in a victory over Surrey that guaranteed Worcestershire promotion to Division 1.In June 2018, Shantry announced his retirement from all cricket with immediate effect, due to ongoing back injuries.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shrewsbury Cricket Club", "response": ["*Jack Shantry - Former Worcestershire all-rounder."]}, {"page": "Richard Scott (cricketer)", "response": ["In 2007 he returned at the age of 43 to play for Dorset in a single Minor Counties Championship match against Shropshire.
