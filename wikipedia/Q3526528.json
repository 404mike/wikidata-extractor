A slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he played in 42 Test matches and 20 One Day Internationals for the England cricket team, as well as playing for Middlesex County Cricket Club from 1986 to 2002. Tufnell took 121 Test match wickets and, although his Test average of 37.68 is considered high for a genuine bowler, he took over 1,000 wickets across all first-class cricket at an average of 29.35, and his cheerful personality and trademark behaviour made him a popular sports personality.Following his retirement in 2002, Tufnell has built on his popularity with several television appearances, including They Think It's All Over, Celebrity Deal Or No Deal, A Question of Sport, Strictly Come Dancing, and winning I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 29", "response": ["*  1966   \u2013 Phil Tufnell, English cricketer and radio host"]}, {"page": "Nick Hancock", "response": ["After passing on the host's duties for both Room 101 and They Think It's All Over, Hancock took a sabbatical to spend more time with his family.

The first ball was a half-volley and Waugh hit it straight from the middle of the bat. However, the ball hit the short leg fielder in the shins. Later in the over, another leg side ball hit his pads, rolled between his legs and onto the stumps, meaning that Waugh missed out on his century.Knight, p. 164."]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Phil Tufnell \u2013 BBC Radio 2003\u2013present, BBC Sport 2020-present"]}, {"page": "Blankety Blank", "response": ["* Show 1 (7 January 2001) - Tracie Bennett, Keith Duffy, Julie Goodyear, Liz McClarnon, Joseph Millson, Phil Tufnell"]}, {"page": "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!", "response": ["* Series 2, 2003: Phil Tufnell"]}, {"page": "List of Have I Got News for You episodes", "response": ["|Carol Barnes and Phil Tufnell"]}, {"page": "GamesMaster", "response": ["*Episode 14 \u2013 Adam Hollioake and Phil Tufnell \u2013 30 January 1997 "]}, {"page": "Test Match Special", "response": ["* Phil Tufnell (\"Tuffers\") (2003\u2013)", "In 2008 Mike Selvey was replaced as a TMS summariser as new producer Adam Mountford brought in Phil Tufnell and Michael Vaughan.
