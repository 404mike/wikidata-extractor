When he moved to England, it was to further his studies at Cambridge University.\nHe played two first-class seasons with the Cambridge University Cricket Club, in 1953 and 1954. In the first of those years he played just six matches but was used considerably more in 1954, appearing in 15 matches. He scored both of his half-centuries in 1954, to go with his 19 wickets.Estcourt was also a good enough rugby union player at university and for Blackheath, that he was capped once for England in the 1955 Five Nations Championship. He was England's fullback in their final fixture, against Scotland at Twickenham. England were victors by three points, a victory that ensured they didn't register a winless campaign.He died on his 89th birthday, 7 January 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|858||No\u00ebl Estcourt||fullback ||1955-03-19||v Scotland at Twickenham"]}, {"page": "Noel Estcourt", "response": ["#REDIRECT No\u00ebl Estcourt "]}, {"page": "Estcourt (surname)", "response": ["*No\u00ebl Estcourt (born 1929), Rhodesian sportsman"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2018", "response": ["*No\u00ebl Estcourt, 89, Rhodesian-born English rugby union player.Noel Sidney Dudley Estcourt"]}]}}
