Field drove a new Jaguar and had a house he called \"Kabri\" (an amalgam of Karin and Brian) with his wife at the Bridle Path, Whitchurch Hill, Oxfordshire, near Pangbourne, while his boss owned a battered Ford and lived in a rundown neighbourhood. Part of the reason for this is that Field was not averse to giving some of his less savoury clients good information on what some of his wealthier clients had in their country houses, making them prime targets for the thieves. Another key reason being that an honest solicitor was useless to a career criminal of that era. What was needed was a bent solicitor who could arrange for alibis and friendly witness statements and bribe police and witnesses. As the managing clerk at his law firm, Field was able to carry out these activities and encourage repeat business.Crossing The Line (1995) by Bruce Reynolds On one occasion he described the contents and layout of a house near Weybridge where his wife Karin had once been a nanny to a couple of criminals that he represented at various times in his career, Gordon Goody and Buster Edwards.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read, Pp27-29 He had arranged Buster's defence when he had been caught with a stolen car, and later met Goody at a nightclub in Soho.

The following day, Goody and Edwards met with Field at his office at James and Wheater (New Quebec Street near Marble Arch). There they met with Field and another man called \"Mark\" who was well dressed, aged around 50, with hair turned silvery grey and who spoke with a smooth accent. \"Mark\" then convinced them to meet the actual informant and drove Edwards and Goody to Finsbury Park where they met another man they nicknamed the \"Ulsterman\", who was a slightly balding middle aged man, who spoke with a Northern Irish lilt (where Goody had grown up). The \"Ulsterman\" told them about the night mail trains doing runs between London and Glasgow with large amounts of money. Edwards and Goody then went and discussed the matter with Reynolds and Wilson and it was agreed that they should make a serious attempt. In the meantime they would recruit others and do practice train robberies. On 31 July, Goody and Edwards met with the \"Ulsterman\" for one last strategy meeting in Hyde Park. They agreed that his share of the loot would be delivered at Brian Field's house.
