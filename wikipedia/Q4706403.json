Connell came through the youth academy at Tottenham Hotspur but received his first professional contract from Ipswich Town, despite this he failed to make an appearance and joined AFC Bournemouth in 2002 where despite making over 50 league appearances he was largely used as a back-up striker. This prompted him to move to Torquay United in 2005 after three years with Bournemouth. A year later he moved on again to Hereford United before re-signing for Bournemouth in 2008. In his second season back with the club he helped them to a 2nd-place finish in League Two thus securing promotion to League One. In the summer of 2010 he signed for Conference National side Grimsby Town where he scored 25 league goals in 46 appearances, this earned him the \"Supporters Player of the Season\" and eventually a move to Swindon Town where he again won promotion from League Two. After a year with Swindon he moved once again, signing with Bradford City. He has since had short stints with Northampton Town and former club, Grimsby Town. He finished his career in Non League playing for both Havant & Waterlooville and Poole Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "AFC Bournemouth", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Alan Connell"]}, {"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|2011|| Alan Connell || Bradley Wood", "|  Alan Connell || 29 || 2010\u201311"]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Alan Connell"]}, {"page": "Andy Williams (footballer, born 1986)", "response": ["His first season in the Football League saw him played out of position on the right wing for the majority of the season resulting in 48 first team appearance, with only Rob Purdie and Alan Connell making more appearances.
