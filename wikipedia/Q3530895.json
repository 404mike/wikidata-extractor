He was heavyweight champion of England from 1821 until his retirement in 1824. After his retirement he became landlord of the Castle Inn at Holborn in London, where he arranged the patronage and contracts of many of the major boxing events of the period while overseeing fair play in the ring.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bare-knuckle boxing", "response": ["The first bare-knuckle champion of England was James Figg, who claimed the title in 1719 and held it until his retirement in 1730. Before Jack Broughton, the first idea of current boxing originated from James Figg, who is viewed as the organizer of cutting edge boxing. In 1719, he set up a 'pugilistic foundation' and charged himself as 'a professional in the Noble Science of Defense' to instruct boxers on the utilization of clench hands, sword, and quarterstaff. Noted champions were Jack Broughton, Elizabeth Wilkinson, Daniel Mendoza, Jem Belcher, Hen Pearce, John Gully, Tom Cribb, Tom Spring, Jem Ward, James Burke, William \"Bendigo\" Thompson, Ben Caunt, William Perry, Tom Sayers and Jem Mace.", "It was during classical pugilism where many famous boxing techniques were invented. Samuel Elias was the first to invent a punch that would later become known as the uppercut.Tacoma News Tribune (Tacoma, WA, USA) Jan. 1, 1924 Tom Spring popularized the use of the left hook and created a technique called the \"Harlequin Step\" where he would put himself just within reach of his opponent, then avoiding the instinctive punch while simultaneously delivering one himself, basically inventing the boxing feint.Tom Spring IBHOF  Daniel Mendoza would become the inventor of the outboxer-style of boxing.", "* Tom Spring 1823-1824"]}, {"page": "Herefordshire", "response": ["* Tom Spring, bare-knuckle boxer, champion of England in the 19th century"]}, {"page": "Simon Byrne", "response": ["The fight against Alexander McKay was Byrne's first brush with notoriety. On 2 June 1830, Byrne, billed as \"Champion of Ireland\", fought McKay, the \"Champion of Scotland\", for the right to challenge Jem Ward, the heavyweight champion of England. The match had been organized at Tom Spring's \"Castle Tavern\", in Holborn. The former champion boxer Tom Spring, as treasurer of the \"Fair Play Club\"\u00a0\u2013 the organization which oversaw boxing\u00a0\u2013 was immensely influential in the boxing world. Along with two other well-known boxers, Gentleman Jackson and Tom Cribb (who also acted as Byrne's manager), he was Byrne's sponsor for the match. Cribb was considered to be one of the greatest fighters of the era; more than 20,000\u00a0people attended one of his fights.", "Cleared of any responsibility for McKay's death, Byrne collected his \u00a3200 prize money, and as the winner earned the right to fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829, but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight, much to the disapproval of his backers and friends. Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of \u00a3250 plus an additional \u00a3250 if he lost; the event became known in some quarters as the Leicester Hoax. Ward did not fight again for two years, but he and Byrne finally met on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. Each fighter was paid \u00a3200. Although Ward was the older man he prevailed in the contest after one hour and seventeen minutes, when Byrne's seconds, Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds, withdrew their man in the 33rd round.", "Tom Spring was once again in Byrne's corner, as was Jem Ward. In true Burke style the match lasted for 3\u00a0hours and 6\u00a0minutes, during which time 99\u00a0rounds were fought the longest ever recorded prize fight. For the most part Byrne seemed to be in control in the early stages of the fight; in the 30th round he trapped Burke against the ropes and battered him severely around the body before throwing him to the ground. Burke fell on his face, vomiting and throwing up blood, and for the next few rounds Byrne looked the more likely winner. By the 49th round however, Burke had recovered sufficiently to knock Byrne to the ground, whose hands by then were so swollen that he was unable to deliver a finishing blow. By the 93rd round Byrne was \"scarcely able to stand, and rolled before the Deaf'un like a ship in a storm\". Although both men were utterly exhausted Burke continued to \"pepper away at [Byrne's] body and head\", until in the 99th round Byrne collapsed unconscious and could not be revived to take his place once again at the scratch. A contemporary newspaper report of the day describes a blow-by-blow account of a fair match.", "Byrne was carried to \"The Woolpack\" inn in nearby St Albans, where he was attended to by Tom Spring. On the evening of the fight Byrne was considered to be close to death, but over the course of the following two days he seemed to be recovering, and was sufficiently conscious to thank his friends for their ministrations. But his condition worsened during the afternoon of Saturday 1 June 1833, and he died the following day; the cause of death was given as \"congestion of blood in the brain\". Byrne himself was reportedly of a different opinion, telling a chambermaid shortly before his death that \"If I should die, it will not be from the beating I received but from mortification. I would rather have died than been beaten in that fight.\" He left behind a wife and four children in Dublin."]}, {"page": "Jem Ward", "response": ["After his reinstatement, he lost his first fight to Josh Hudson.

In the late 18th century, boxing became more commercialised with promoters and publicans organising paid matches that attracted spectators, and with them heavy betting. In 1797 the skilful 'Whitechapel Jew', Daniel Mendoza fought in a match near Neath and 1819 saw exhibition bouts staged by two of England's greatest bare-knuckle boxers, Tom Cribb and Tom Spring.Stead; Williams (2008) p.4 One of the more common ways for the Welsh public to watch a fight was at race meets. Boxing had always been associated with horse racing, and according to the Racing Calendar the favoured Welsh courses were Brecon, Carmarthen, Knighton, Wrexham and Monmouth. In 1824 the 4,000 racing pundits at Monmouth were also entertained with a fight in which a quarryman called Parry beat Powell in a 103-round contest.Stead; Williams (2008) p.5 The early 19th century also witnessed the emergence of Welsh boxers whose fame extended beyond the confines of the boxing rings. One of the first Welsh fighters of note, despite being born in Southwark in London, was Ned Turner. Turner's parents were both from Montgomeryshire and he was dubbed the \"pugilistic prince of Wales' by the North Wales Gazette in 1823.Stead; Williams (2008) p.6 "]}, {"page": "Thomas Spring", "response": ["*Tom Spring (1795\u20131851), bare-knuckle fighter"]}, {"page": "Ned Painter", "response": ["Painter twice fought Tom Spring in 1818.

He fought on until the 31st round despite his injury but lost the fight. Painter's defeat came as a major upset to the sporting community, and a lot of people lost money betting on the fight. Egan documented: \"Painter, from his hard hitting and bottom qualities, stood so high in the estimation of the amateurs, that it was booked Spring would prove an easy conquest to him.\" A rematch took place on 7 August 1818; many of Painter's devoted fans had shifted their allegiance to Spring and he was now the favourite to win. Painter slugged it out for 42 rounds, giving Spring a powerful right above his right eye, before defeating him. According to Frank L. Dowling, Painter \"had not been a successful boxer, but the men he had fought were known to be first-raters, and he displayed such gluttony and stamina.\""]}, {"page": "Spring (surname)", "response": ["* Tom Spring (1795-1851) English bare-knuckle fighter and English heavy weight champion"]}]}}
