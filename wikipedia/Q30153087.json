In 1900, he was named a Lecturer of modern history at the college, and from 1928 to 1934 was a University Lecturer in that subject. His seminal work, A History of the Anglo-Saxons, was published in 1935, and in his retirement he published Six Centuries of an Oxford College: A History of the Queen's College, 1340\u20131940.\nHodgkin was part of a line of historians; his father, Thomas Hodgkin, was a recognised historian of Europe in the Middle Ages in addition to a banker, while his son, Thomas Lionel Hodgkin, was a Marxist historian of Africa. Robert Hodgkin was also part of a so-called \"Quaker dynasty\", with many notable and accomplished relatives. He was forced to leave the Quakers over his military service in the Second Boer War, when he volunteered to serve in the Northumberland Fusiliers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "\u00c6thelbald, King of Wessex", "response": ["Robert Howard Hodgkin also adopted Asser's views in his 1935 History of the Anglo-Saxons, but later historians have been more circumspect.
