In 1860, he was elected Associate of the Watercolour Society (ARWS). He contributed two illustrations, The Shoeblack and A Christmas Invitation, to Passages From Modern English Poets (1862), one called A Father's Lament to Robert Aris Willmott's English Sacred Poetry of the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth Centuries (1863) and another to The Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century at the Great Exhibition MDCCCLI by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, published by Day & Son, London, 1851\u20131853.He exhibited works in oil at the Royal Academy until the late 1870s.His work is now in the collections of the Royal Institution of Cornwall (The Ringers of Launcells Tower, 1887), Manchester City Galleries (Early Lovers, 1857), and the Atkinson Art Gallery at Southport (The Lost Glove, 1858). Some of his drawings are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, including a sketch of a wall decoration by John Gregory Crace.", "link_mentions": {}}}
