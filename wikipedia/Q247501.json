Nonetheless, some physicists continued to doubt whether radiation would be produced by a binary star system, where the world lines of the centers of mass of the two stars should, according to the EIH approximation (dating from 1938 and due to Einstein, Infeld, and Banesh Hoffmann), follow timelike geodesics."]}, {"page": "Gabriel Kron", "response": ["According to Alger, Kron \"worked with fifteen different managers while with General Electric.\" Alger explained, \"Kron\u2019s value was largely in the inspiration he gave to others and in distant objectives that seemed to business managers to be merely dreams.\" From 1936 to 1942 Kron published primarily in the General Electric Review.

A requirement for membership was that each new member should write and deliver a paper dealing with some question concerning any of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but this was waived in Asimov's case since he did not know the stories well enough. However, in 1975 the BSI decided to publish a collection of such articles, and members Banesh Hoffmann and Michael Harrison asked Asimov to write one. Hoffmann suggested that he write about The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a fictional treatise on astronomy written by Holmes's arch-enemy, Professor Moriarty. The Dynamics of an Asteroid is mentioned only once in Doyle's novel The Valley of Fear (1914), where it is described as a book renowned for containing such rarefied mathematics that there was supposedly no other scientist capable of fully understanding it. However, there were no other clues as to what its contents might be, since Doyle had written no more about it. Hoffmann therefore asked Asimov to speculate about what Moriarty might have written. This idea appealed to Asimov, and he wrote a 1,600-word essay on the matter, \"Dynamics of an Asteroid,\" which was published in Beyond Baker Street: A Sherlockian Anthology (Bobbs-Merrill, 1976).Asimov, Isaac.

Stachel went on to say that the biography sections \"constitutes the most accurate account of Einstein's life yet written\" and that the book is \"both unique and indispensable for any serious Einstein scholar\". He closed the review by saying the book would \"serve not only as a source of profound insight and pleasure to many readers but as a further spur to the current renaissance of Einstein studies\". In a second 1982 review, John Allen Paulos wrote that it \"is a superb book.\".  Banesh Hoffmann reviewed the book in 1983 calling it \"outstanding\" and that it is a \"lively book\" and a \"major contribution to Einstein scholarship\". Isaac Asimov wrote that the book gives a \"concise history of the physics involved\" and that it is \"engagingly written\". William Hunter McCrea wrote a critical review of the book in 1983, taking issue with several of Pais' statements, but wrote that overall, it was \"a major work on Einstein\" and that \"[f]or those who know well what Einstein achieved, but who may have wondered how he did it, this book should tell them almost all they can ever hope to learn.\" A third 1983 review stated that the book is a \"superb biography of Einstein\" and was likely to \"become required reading for anyone interested in the history of 20th century physics\". The book was also reviewed in German that same year.", "Among criticisms of various aspects of the book, several reviews noted that understanding many parts of the book would require a background in physics. Some reviewers also noted that Pais did not expound on Einstein's political and social views past a brief presentation. The reference system used in the book was also criticized by some reviewers as \"unnecessarily complicated\". Timothy Ferris noted several other problems in his New York Times review and pointed out that Pais has a tendency to be \"overly reticent\". In his 1983 review, Banesh Hoffmann wrote that the book contained \"some strange omissions\" relating to some of Einstein's shortcomings and statements he made. Peter Mason wrote: \"One deficiency is the failure to relate Einstein\u2019s development to the social conditions of the time.\"", "Other reviewers brought up specific issues with the development as well, including William Hunter McCrea, who criticized the book for not including Sir Arthur Eddington's book The Mathematical Theory of Relativity in his list of books on the development of general relativity. McCrea went on to state that Pais included details of a non-existent woman who fainted from excitement upon Einstein's arrival and that the woman was later randomly transformed into a man. McCrea claimed that \"[s]uch indications make one uncertain about the judgements and historical details in the book\". In his 1983 review, Banesh Hoffmann noted that Pais fails to mention \"Einstein's long-held erroneous belief that if one went from Minkowski coordinates to more general coordinates, one would no longer be dealing with the special theory of relativity\", but that he \"makes ample amends\" by including a quote from Einstein on the topic, stating that \"[o]ne could hardly want a clearer indication of the extraordinary power of Einstein's intuition\"."]}]}}
