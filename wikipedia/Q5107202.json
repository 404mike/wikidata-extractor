In 1996, his first full year as a Senior, Dooher helped Tyrone win the Ulster Senior Football Championship. Tyrone then advanced to play Meath in the All-Ireland semi-final, but were defeated. Dooher was one of several Tyrone players, along with Ciaran McBride, Jody Gormley, Chris Lawn and Peter Canavan who suffered injuries at the hands of what many Tyrone fans perceived as heavy-handed tactics by Meath. Meath defender, Martin O'Connell stood on Dooher's head while he had been felled. During the half-time interval, Dooher had to receive staples in his head, and played the rest of the game heavily bandaged. Despite this, he won the Ulster GAA Writers Player of the Year Award, at the age of just 20."]}, {"page": "Moortown, County Tyrone", "response": ["Gaelic football is the main sport of the area, with Moortown St Malachy's GAC () being the local club. Moortown are currently a senior team. Moortown won the county championship in 1992. Chris Lawn won two All-Ireland medals with the Tyrone county team. The home pitch is Tobin Park but will relocate to an adjacent new leisure complex at Aneter Road. Moortown had a very successful hurling club formed by Master Tom Magner around 1960 which competed in the Tyrone league and later in the South Derry and Armagh leagues. Several Moortown hurlers represented County Tyrone at both minor and senior hurling level during the 1960s and 1970s. A camogie team existed in Moortown during the 1950s. A new camogie team has recently been set up."]}]}}
