Ratcliffe was a right-handed batsman. He was born in Dulwich, Surrey.\nHis early education was undertaken at Rydal School,\nRatcliffe made his first-class debut for Wales against the touring West Indians in 1928. He later made 3 further first-class appearances for Wales, the last of which came against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1930. He scored 227 runs for Wales, which came at an average of 32.42, with a high score of 73.Ratcliffe undertook his studies at Cambridge University in 1930, it was in that same year that he made his debut for Cambridge University Cricket Club in a first-class match against Yorkshire, the same season in which he made debut for Denbighshire in the Minor Counties Championship, with him playing 4 further matches for the Welsh county up to 1931. He represented Cambridge University in first-class cricket on another 32 occasions, with his final match for the university coming against Oxford University in 1932. In his 33 first-class appearances, he scored 1,545 runs at an average of 30.29. He made 7 fifties and 5 centuries, with a high score of 201. This score, which was his only career double century, came against Oxford University at Lord's. This innings exceeded the highest score made in a university match by 29 runs, beating the previous high score held by John Marsh. This record though stood for only one day, as the next day the Nawab of Pataudi broke this record by scoring 238 not out for Oxford University. While at Cambridge, he also made the first of first-class appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Army.His performances for Cambridge University caught the eyes of Surrey, who signed him. He made his debut for Surrey midway through the 1932 season against Hampshire. He made 6 further first-class appearances for Surrey, the last of which came against Leicestershire in the 1933 County Championship. His time at Surrey was less successful than his endeavours at Cambridge, with him scoring just 142 runs at an average of 17.75, with a high score of 34. He left Surrey at the end of the 1933 season, later joining Buckinghamshire in 1937, making his debut for the county in that seasons Minor Counties Championship against Bedfordshire. He made 11 further appearances for Buckinghamshire, the last of which came against Hertfordshire in 1939. During this period, two further first-class appearances came for the Marylebone Cricket Club, in 1938 against Yorkshire and in Cambridge University in 1939. Following World War II, he made one further first-class appearance, for an Over-33 team against an Under-33 team at Lord's in 1945, although this final appearance came with no success.Ratcliffe died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 21 August 1967.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi", "response": ["Iftikhar Ali Khan was coached at school in India by Oxford cricketer M. G. Slater and then in England by Frank Woolley.  He went to Oxford in 1927. It was two years before he won a blue; this was for a 106 and 84 that saved a match against Cambridge. In the 1931 season, he scored 1,307 runs for Oxford and finished with a batting average of 93, heading the Oxford averages. In the University Match that year, Alan Ratcliffe scored 201 for Cambridge, a new record.  Pataudi declared that he would beat it, and hit 238* on the very next day. This stood as a record for the University Match until 2005.  Pataudi qualified to play for Worcestershire in 1932 but played only three matches and scored just 65 runs in six innings. However, his slaughter of Tich Freeman with marvellous footwork during an innings of 165 for the Gentlemen at Lord's in July 1932 gained him a place on the Ashes tour for that winter.  He was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1932."]}, {"page": "Alan Melville", "response": ["631 runs and an average of 35.05, though there were no centuries. Injury to the University team's designated captain, Denis Moore, meant that Melville led the side in the University Match where, with an unbeaten 238 from the Nawab of Pataudi which overshadowed 201 for Cambridge by Alan Ratcliffe, Oxford achieved the first victory over Cambridge since 1923. In 1932, Melville was the Oxford captain in his own right, but his season was disrupted by injury \u2013 though not to the same degree as Moore's had been in 1931 \u2013 when he broke his collarbone while batting in the match against the Free Foresters by colliding with his partner, Pieter van der Bijl. Melville had made an unbeaten century, 113* before the collision. On his return to the side in late June, he was successful with the ball, taking a hat-trick and nine wickets in the game against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, and he finished top of the University bowling averages. In the University Match, Melville was unable to repeat his leadership success of 1931, and the match was drawn."]}, {"page": "The University Match (cricket)", "response": ["*201 Alan Ratcliffe, Cambridge, Lord's, 1931"]}, {"page": "Robert Scott (cricketer)", "response": ["Scott finally broke through to regular first-class cricket in 1931. In the seniors' trial match he top-scored with 65 and took two wickets, and he then played in all of the University's 12 first-class matches as a lower middle-order batsman and bowler. In an Oxford side with a strong batting line-up led by Melville and the Nawab of Pataudi, Scott made occasional useful scores, with a best of 61 against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI. But his Blue was based on usefulness as a bowler and he proved it in the University Match against Cambridge University. The match was dominated by two record-breaking batting performances as first Alan Ratcliffe, the Cambridge opening batsman, scored the first-ever double-century in the University Match with 201, and then the Nawab of Pataudi bettered that with 238 not out; Scott was the only Oxford bowler in Cambridge's first innings to restrain the batsmen and he recorded figures of six wickets for 64 runs from 33.2 overs, which remained the best of his first-class cricket career. He then took two further wickets as Cambridge collapsed in the second innings to leave Oxford just 55 runs for an easy victory."]}, {"page": "George Kemp-Welch", "response": ["Kemp-Welch was captain of both the soccer and the cricket teams in his final year at Cambridge, and as centre-forward in the football team he was also seen as the key player on the Cambridge side in the University soccer match. In the event, the University match was drawn 1-1 in atrocious conditions with a boggy pitch and thick fog. In cricket, Kemp-Welch gave up bowling, but in the 1931 season for both Cambridge University and Warwickshire \u2013 and for other amateur teams as well \u2013 he batted far better than in any other season, finishing with an aggregate of 1561 runs at an average of 37.16. As Cambridge cricket captain, he led a team that was highly inconsistent throughout the season, yet his own form as an opening batsman was consistently good, and he scored 1111 runs during the university season, more than 2.5 times the highest aggregate of any of his team-mates; included in this total were the first three centuries of his career, the highest being 126 against the H. D. G. Leveson Gower XI just before the University Match. The inconsistency of the team as a whole lost them the University Match; Kemp-Welch's opening batsman colleague, Alan Ratcliffe, a last-minute selection for the team as he had been out of form all season, scored the first double century in the history of the University Match and put on 149 for the first wicket with Kemp-Welch, yet Cambridge still lost after Ratcliffe's innings was surpassed by the Nawab of Pataudi for Oxford and through a poor Cambridge second-innings batting performance. Following the University Match, Kemp-Welch was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's; he played in two further Gentlemen v Players games in cricket festivals at the end of the season, and in between appeared in most of Warwickshire's fixtures."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Alan Ratcliffe (1931\u20131939) : A.
