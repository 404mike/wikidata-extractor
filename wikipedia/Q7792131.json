His father and grandfather, who were both named Thomas Penson, were also surveyors and architects.  His grandfather Thomas Penson (c. 1760\u20131824) worked from an office in Wrexham, North Wales, and was responsible for the design of bridges, roads, gaols and buildings in North Wales.  His son Thomas Penson (1790\u20131859) was county surveyor to a number of Welsh counties and also designed bridges.  He later moved to Oswestry, Shropshire where he established an architectural practice.  Thomas Mainwaring Penson was born in Oswestry, and was educated at Oswestry School.  His elder brother  was Richard Kyrke Penson who became a partner in the Oswestry practice in 1854, before developing an extensive architectural practice of his own, mainly in South Wales. Thomas Mainwaring Penson  trained in his  father's practice.  Thomas Mainwaring initially designed buildings in the area of the practice, including stations for the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway.He was then appointed as County Surveyor of Cheshire and moved to Chester, Cheshire.  Here he laid out Overleigh Cemetery in 1848\u201350.  This has been designated by English Heritage at Grade II in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.  He is credited with pioneering the Black-and-white Revival (vernacular or half-timbered) style in the city during the 1850s.  His first building in this style was constructed in Eastgate Street in 1852, but it has since been demolished.  His other notable buildings in Chester were designed both in Black-and-white Revival and in other styles.  They include Crypt Chambers (1858) in Eastgate Street, which is in Gothic Revival style, Queen Hotel (1860\u201361) opposite Chester railway station, which is Italianate, and Grosvenor Hotel (1863\u201386) in Eastgate Street, which is constructed in a mixture of timber-framing, brick and stone.  These three buildings have all been designated by English Heritage as listed buildings,  Crypt Chambers at Grade I, and the other two at Grade II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oswestry", "response": ["* Thomas Mainwaring Penson (1818 in Oswestry \u2013 1864) surveyor and architect,  Oswestry Town Trail, Willow Street, Shropshire County Council retrieved 17 March 2018 educated at Oswestry School"]}, {"page": "Flintshire (historic)", "response": ["Flintshire County Council established its base at the old County Hall in Chester Street in Mold.

By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T.\u00a0A.\u00a0Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries."]}, {"page": "Castle Park House", "response": ["Category:Thomas Mainwaring Penson buildings"]}, {"page": "Thomas Penson", "response": ["Thomas Penson, or Thomas Penson the younger (c. 1790 \u2013 1859) was the county surveyor of Denbighshire and Montgomeryshire.
