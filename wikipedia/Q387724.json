This claim was completely ignored. In 1894, English archaeologist Worthington George Smith discovered 200 similar perforated fossils in Bedfordshire, England, and also speculated that their function was beads, though he made no reference to Boucher de Perthes' find possibly because he was unaware of it. In 2005, Robert Bednarik reexamined the material, and concluded that \u2014 because all the Bedfordshire P. globularis fossils are sub-spherical and range  in diameter, despite this species having a highly variable shape \u2014 they were deliberately chosen. They appear to have been bored through completely or almost completely by some parasitic creature (i. e., through natural processes), and were then percussed on what would have been the more closed-off end to fully open the hole. He also found wear facets which he speculated were begotten from clacking against other beads when they were strung together and worn as a necklace. (Convenience link) In 2009, Solange Rigaud, Francisco d'Errico, and colleagues noticed that the modified areas are lighter in colour than the unmodifed, suggesting they were inflicted much more recently such as during excavation. They were also unconvinced that the fossils could be confidently associated with the Acheulian artefacts from the sites, and suggested that \u2014 as an alternative to archaic human activity \u2014 apparent size-selection could have been caused by either natural geological processes or 19th century collectors favouring this specific form."]}, {"page": "John Ramsbottom (mycologist)", "response": ["* (1923) A handbook of the larger British Fungi British Museum, Dep't of Botany, London, OCLC 4142558 illustrated with engravings by Worthington George Smith."]}, {"page": "Nanteos Cup", "response": ["The cup was correctly identified and subsequently catalogued by the Society as a wooden mazer dating from the Middle Ages.

Wood also noted that Worthington G. Smith had made sketches of archaeological excavations at Strata Florida Abbey and suggested that the cup may actually have been found during those excavations. Powell was known to have had repairs carried out to make the unstable abbey ruins safe and the appearance of the Nanteos Cup \"coincided quite closely\" with these repairs. Richard Barber, a historian specialising in Arthurian legends, has also proposed that the cup was probably discovered at the site of the abbey in the 19th century. John Thomas Evans, in his The Church Plate of Cardiganshire (1914), suggested that the cup may have been passed to the Powell family from the Stedman family, who owned the Strata Florida estate, when Richard Stedman died in 1746: Wood points out that there is no record of the cup in any will or inventory of the Stedman or Powell families."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Smith", "response": ["*Worthington George Smith (1835\u20131917), English mycologist and archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Building (magazine)", "response": ["Other contributors to The Builder over the years have included architects such as Robert Dennis Chantrell, Henry Clutton (1819\u201393), Josiah Conder, James Fergusson, William Curtis Green (1875\u20131960), John Woody Papworth (1820\u201370), Howard Morley Robertson (1888\u20131963) and William White.ODNB They have also included the novelist Hall Caine, the engineer and antiquary G.

It was later raised to generic level by Petter Karsten in 1879. However, several molecular studies published in the 2000s demonstrated that Psilocybe, as it was defined then, was polyphyletic. The studies supported the idea of dividing the genus into two clades, one consisting of the bluing, hallucinogenic species, and the other made of the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species. However, the generally accepted lectotype (a specimen later selected when the original author of a taxon name did not designate a type) of the genus as a whole was Psilocybe montana, a non-hallucinogenic species; if those forms of the species in the study were to be segregated, it would leave the hallucinogenic clade without a valid name. To resolve this taxonomical dilemma, it was proposed in 2005 to conserve the name Psilocybe, with P.\u00a0semilanceata as the type, leaving the option to use Deconica as the name for the non-hallucinogenic clade. The proposal was accepted unanimously by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi in 2009. Recently, it has been reported that the non-bluing Psilocybe fuscofulva does not produce hallucinogenic compounds. Thus, non-hallucinogenic species are also covered by the genus Psilocybe, not only Deconica."]}, {"page": "Common scab", "response": ["The first known reference to common scab dates back to 1825 when it was included in John Claudius Loudon Encyclopaedia of Agriculture. It was not known what caused it then, it was not thought to have a biological cause, but was noted to be associated with soils treated with alkaline materials. In 1884, Worthington George Smith suggested that it was caused by grit in soil irritating potato tubers as they grew. The theory gained much support, as it was known to be more common on light gritty soils. In 1890 however, Roland Thaxter isolated a microbe that could cause common scab lesions, naming it Oospora scabies. Over the years, this species was renamed several times, now being known as Streptomyces scabies. In 1977, the acid-tolerant S.\u00a0acidiscabies was found to also cause common scab, and then in 1996, S.\u00a0turgidiscabies was isolated."]}, {"page": "Volvariella surrecta", "response": ["Volvariella surrecta is a rare species, even though its major host is quite common; the conditions required for the parasite to produce fruit bodies are not well known.

No definite preference for soil type has been determined, having been found in sands, clay, gravels, and peat. In 1867, Worthington George Smith reported that he had successfully cultivated the species by partially burying fruit bodies under water-soaked rotting fir leaves that were placed in a bell-glass in a warm room. According to his account, a white mycelium grew over the leaves and eventually formed small white pins (immature, undifferentiated fruit bodies) that grew into fully formed mushrooms about two weeks after starting."]}, {"page": "Stephen W.
