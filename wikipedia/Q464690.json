Executioners were sometimes coerced into the role.  Derrick in particular had been convicted of rape but was pardoned by the Earl of Essex (clearing him of the death penalty) on the condition that he became an executioner at Tyburn.Derrick executed more than 3,000 people in his career, including his pardoner, the Earl of Essex, in 1601.  Derrick devised a beam with a topping lift and pulleys for his hangings, instead of the old-fashioned rope over the beam method.\nThe word derrick became an eponym for the frame from which the hangman's noose was supported and through that usage (by analogy) to modern day cranes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tyburn", "response": ["* Thomas Derrick ", "* Thomas Derrick an executioner at Tyburn."]}, {"page": "Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex", "response": ["Essex was found guilty and, on 25 February 1601, was beheaded on Tower Green, the last person to be beheaded in the Tower of London. It was reported to have taken three strokes by the executioner Thomas Derrick to complete the beheading. Previously Thomas Derrick had been convicted of rape but had been pardoned by the Earl of Essex himself (clearing him of the death penalty) on the condition that he become an executioner at Tyburn. At Sir Walter Raleigh's own execution on 29 October 1618, it was alleged that Raleigh had said to a co-conspirator, \"Do not, as my Lord Essex did, take heed of a preacher. By his persuasion, he confessed, and made himself guilty.\" In that same trial, Raleigh also denied that he had stood at a window during the execution of Essex's sentence, disdainfully puffing out tobacco smoke in sight of the condemned man. Essex in the end shocked many by denouncing his sister Penelope, Lady Rich as his co-conspirator: the Queen, who was determined to show as much clemency as possible, ignored the charge."]}, {"page": "List of inventions named after people", "response": ["* Derrick \u2013 Thomas Derrick"]}, {"page": "Richard Brandon", "response": ["*Thomas Derrick"]}, {"page": "List of eponyms (A\u2013K)", "response": ["* Thomas Derrick (c. 1600), British hangman \u2013 Derrick (lifting device)"]}, {"page": "List of executioners", "response": ["| Thomas Derrick || 1601- before 1616 (London)"]}, {"page": "Derrick", "response": ["Forms of derricks are commonly found aboard ships and at docking facilities.
