The house has a 1732 painting by William Hogarth of the Cholmondeley family, to whom the house eventually passed. George Cholmondeley, 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley's marriage to Sybil Sassoon, who is portrayed in John Singer Sargent's The Countess of Rocksavage (1922), brought her paintings to the house, including Jean-Baptiste Oudry's 1753 still-life The White Duck (stolen in 1990). Other fine pieces include a Louis XVI cabinet topped by a vase of flowers in Vincennes porcelain. The house contains two early (1754 and 1758\u201359) self-portraits by Thomas Gainsborough, plus his 1754\u201355 painting Mr. and Mrs. Browne of Tunstall, of two of the painter's Suffolk neighbors. Norwich's favorite painting in the house is Holbein's Portrait of a Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling (completed 1526\u20131528, purchased by the National Gallery in 1992)."]}]}}
