The critic Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post felt Winslet had failed to effectively portray her. Her next release of the year, Collateral Beauty, about a man (played by Will Smith) struggling with the death of his daughter, was panned by critics. Writing for New York Magazine, Emily Yoshida dismissed the film as a vacuous remake of A Christmas Carol and remarked that Winslet had \"never looked more painted and tired\". It was a modest earner at the box office. Winslet agreed to the romantic disaster film The Mountain Between Us (2017) to take on the challenge of a role requiring physical exertion. It featured Idris Elba and her as two strangers who crash land on an icy and isolated mountain range. They filmed in the mountains of Western Canada at  above sea level where the temperature was well below freezing. Winslet performed her own stunts and described it as the most physically gruelling experience of her career.
