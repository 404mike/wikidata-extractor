Commissioned into the British Army at the age of nine, he was placed on half-pay after the 104th Regiment of Foot (Royal Manchester Volunteers) was disbanded in 1795.  \nAfter passing out from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Lindsay joined the Bengal Army of the East India Company as an artillery officer in 1804.  He served in a number of sieges and on campaign in Bundelkhand before joining David Ochterlony's army in the 1814\u201316 Anglo-Nepalese War, in which he was wounded in the hand and leg.  Lindsay recovered to fight in the 1817\u201318 Third Anglo-Maratha War and later had responsibility for telegraphs and gunpowder manufacture in part of Bengal.  He commanded the artillery of Joseph Wanton Morrison's division during the 1824\u201326 First Anglo-Burmese War.  Lindsay was promoted to major-general in 1838, to lieutenant-general in 1851 and to  general in 1859.  His general's commission was transferred to the British Army when the East India Company armies were absorbed in the 1860s.  Because of this he was in the unusual position of holding two British Army commissions, one as a lieutenant (from his service in the 104th Regiment) and one as a general.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Lindsay", "response": ["*Alexander Lindsay of Barnweill (before 1279\u2013ca. 1309), son of David de Lindsay of the Byres", "*Alexander Lindsay of Glenesk (before 1350\u20131381), knight renowned in Wars of Scottish Independence", "*Alexander Lindsay, 2nd Earl of Crawford (1387\u20131438), son of David Lindsay, 1st Earl of Crawford and Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of Robert II", "*Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford (before 1425\u20131453), the Tiger Earl; participated in Douglas rebellion against James II", "*Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie (ca. 1564\u20131607), son of David Lindsay, 10th Earl of Crawford; Privy Counsellor", "*Alexander Lindsay, 2nd Lord Spynie (ca. 1597\u20131646), son of 1st Lord Spynie; fought in Thirty Years' War in the service of Christian IV of Denmark", "*Alexander Lindsay, 1st Earl of Balcarres (1618\u20131659), son of David Lindsay, 1st Lord Balcarres; Covenanter, Engager, MP, Exchequer and Earl", "*Sir Alexander Lindsay, 3rd Baronet (1683\u20131762), married Amelia, daughter of David Murray, 5th Viscount Stormont", "*Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Balcarres (before 1695\u20131736), son of Colin Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Balcarres; captain in Lord Orkney's regiment; representative peer of Scotland", "*Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres (1752\u20131825), son of James Lindsay, 5th Earl of Balcarres; major in American Revolution; governor of Jersey and Jamaica", "*Alexander Lindsay, 25th Earl of Crawford (1812\u20131880), son of James Lindsay, 24th Earl of Crawford; art historian, genealogist and book collector ", "*Alexander Lindsay (rower) (born 1936), British Olympic rower", "*Alec Lindsay or Alexander Lindsay (born 1948), English footballer", "*Alexander Lindsay of Evelick (bishop) (1561\u20131639), Scottish minister, Bishop of Dunkeld", "*Alexander Lindsay (East India Company officer) (1785\u20131872)", "*Alexander Lindsay (entrepreneur) (1841\u20131920), Scottish-American co-founder of Sibley, Lindsay and Curr department store"]}]}}
