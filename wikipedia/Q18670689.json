Commissioned into the British Army at the age of nine, he was placed on half-pay after the 104th Regiment of Foot (Royal Manchester Volunteers) was disbanded in 1795.  \nAfter passing out from the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Lindsay joined the Bengal Army of the East India Company as an artillery officer in 1804.  He served in a number of sieges and on campaign in Bundelkhand before joining David Ochterlony's army in the 1814\u201316 Anglo-Nepalese War, in which he was wounded in the hand and leg.  Lindsay recovered to fight in the 1817\u201318 Third Anglo-Maratha War and later had responsibility for telegraphs and gunpowder manufacture in part of Bengal.  He commanded the artillery of Joseph Wanton Morrison's division during the 1824\u201326 First Anglo-Burmese War.  Lindsay was promoted to major-general in 1838, to lieutenant-general in 1851 and to  general in 1859.  His general's commission was transferred to the British Army when the East India Company armies were absorbed in the 1860s.  Because of this he was in the unusual position of holding two British Army commissions, one as a lieutenant (from his service in the 104th Regiment) and one as a general.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
