He is known primarily as a specialist fielding coach but has also performed the roles of head coach and assistant coach. He has worked on the coaching staffs of the West Indies, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and England and has coached at 36 test matches, 106 ODIs, and 28 T20 Internationals. This includes two ICC Fifty Over World Cups, one ICC T20 World Cup, one Asia Cup, and one Champions Trophy. He has also coached at a wide variety of domestic or franchise fixtures.\nHe coaches both international and domestic or franchise cricket and was part of the BPL Winning Dhaka Gladiators coaching staff in 2012 and the Stanford Superstars coaching staff in 2008, when the team beat England convincingly in a one off Twenty Million Dollar game in Antigua during the Stanford Super Series.\nFountain was the first baseball player to be used as a Specialist Fielding Coach by any test level cricket team when he was hired in 1998 by the West Indies to coach on their tour of South Africa. On the 2000/01 West Indies tour of Australia he took to the field as substitute fielder for the West Indies against the Prime Ministers eleven at the Manuka Oval in Canberra. He rose to the challenge by running out Anthony McQuire with a direct hit from the boundary.\nHe has acted as Substitute Fielder (12th Man) a total of four times for both West Indies in 2001 & 2007 and Pakistan in 2013.\nAlong with ICC Full Member teams, he has coached both ICC Associate & ICC Affiliate cricket teams, during his career and was recently the head coach of South Korea during the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon who were the host nation. They achieved great success, despite having very little playing experience, taking eight wickets against the Sri Lanka national cricket team in the quarter final. Other teams who have used him include  Ireland, Bermuda, Trinidad and Canada.\nDuring the 2010 Micromax ODI series against Zimbabwe, Fountain was appointed temporary head coach of Bangladesh, for the 3rd and 4th ODI's, whilst Jamie Siddons attended the birth of his second child back in Australia. Bangladesh won the 3rd ODI, however the fourth was abandoned due to rain. This made Fountain the first baseball coach to achieve head coach status with an ICC full member nation cricket team, as well as being the first baseball coach to instruct an ICC full member nation cricket team (West Indies in 1998).\nIn March 2012 Fountain was re-appointed as specialist fielding coach for Pakistan, and was based at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore, Pakistan. He worked exclusively with Pakistan cricketers at Test, ODI and T20 matches and was able to raise the standard of fielding significantly during his two-year tenure, which saw Pakistan win the 2012 Asia Cup and achieve both ODI and T20 success against Sri Lanka, India, and South Africa.\nIn January 2015 Fountain launched a project called Switch Hit 20 designed to help former professional baseball players transition into T20 cricketers. This coincided with him accepting an invitation from the American Cricket Federation (ACF) to join their Honorary Advisory Board, where he joins existing HAB members Arjuna Ranatunga, Ian Chappell, Clive Lloyd, Shaun Pollock, Michael Holding, Stuart MacGill, Damien Martyn, Nathan Bracken, Alvin Kallicharran, Niall O'Brien, Vince Adams, Ian Pont, and Stephen Rooke.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1970", "response": ["* July 25 \u2013 Julien Fountain, English cricket coach "]}, {"page": "Julian (given name)", "response": ["*Julien Fountain, English cricket coach"]}, {"page": "Great Ballard School", "response": ["* Julien Fountain, cricketer and baseball player"]}, {"page": "2008 Stanford Super Series", "response": [" Coach, Fielding: Julien Fountain"]}, {"page": "Julian Fountain", "response": ["#REDIRECTJulien Fountain"]}, {"page": "Julien (given name)", "response": ["* Julien Fountain (born 1970), an English professional cricket coach"]}, {"page": "2016 Pakistan Super League players draft", "response": ["*  Julien Fountain (Fielding Coach)"]}]}}
