Askey was sacked two days later and Legge took to Twitter to deny that there had ever been a rift between the players and manager, saying that \"a good man lost his job because we as a group of players failed to deliver on the pitch\". Interim manager Danny Pugh then moved the captaincy on to Tom Conlon and refused to name Legge in matchday squads following his return from suspension.

He made his first start for Burton Albion in an FA Cup fixture against Altrincham which resulted in a 3\u20133 draw. With the Blades suffering injury problems Chapell was recalled early from his loan at the start of December, leaving Burton after having made four appearances and scored one goal. After making his first league appearance for United in December 2012, Chapell was loaned out once more in March, moving to Torquay United until the end of the season. He made his Torquay d\u00e9but a few days later, in a 1\u20131 draw against Southend United at Roots Hall, providing the assist for Joss Labadie's goal. On 12 April 2013 Sheffield United's caretaker manager Chris Morgan recalled Chapell from his loan spell, and he returned to United having played six times for Torquay. The following June Chapell extended his contract with the Blades once more."]}]}}
