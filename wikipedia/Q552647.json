He is a 3-time race winner in both MotoGP and the Superbike World Championship. Crutchlow is contracted as a test rider for Yamaha Motor Racing, which he is expected to continue in 2022. During 2021 he returned to race for two Yamaha teams as a replacement rider in four MotoGP races.\nIn 2011, Crutchlow joined the MotoGP World Championship with Monster Yamaha Tech 3. After finishing his rookie season in 2011 without a podium finish, Crutchlow managed to achieve two podium finishes and finished 7th in the overall standings in 2012. In 2013, Crutchlow managed four podium finishes, a points tally of 188 and finished 5th in the overall standings as the top satellite (non-factory) rider. This earned him a move to the factory Ducati team in 2014 finishing 13th in the championship with a podium finish in Aragon. After one season with Ducati, Crutchlow moved to LCR Honda in 2015. He won the 2016 Czech Republic motorcycle Grand Prix becoming the first Briton since Barry Sheene in 1981 to win a premier class race, which he followed up with another win in Australia. After one podium in 2017, Crutchlow achieved his 3rd premier class win in Argentina in 2018. Another three podiums followed in 2019 and after the 2020 season without a top five finish, Crutchlow was replaced by \u00c1lex M\u00e1rquez for 2021. Crutchlow is the only LCR Honda rider to date to win a MotoGP race and finished on the podium in MotoGP for eight consecutive seasons from 2012 to 2019. \nCrutchlow was the 2006 British Supersport Championship champion and the 2009 Supersport World Championship champion with Yamaha. He also won races in the British Superbike Championship finishing 3rd in 2008 and in the Superbike World Championship finishing 5th in 2010.\nIn early 2017, the RAC awarded Crutchlow the Torrens Trophy, an accolade made in recognition of \"outstanding contribution to motorcycling in the United Kingdom\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.", "response": ["For , Ducati Team raced with Nicky Hayden and the Italian rider Andrea Dovizioso.

He started from seventh on the grid but moved to fourth on the opening lap and overtook the fading Pedrosa for third on lap three. Rossi then was caught by the Tech 3 Yamaha's of Cal Crutchlow and Andrea Dovizioso who battled with him over the bottom step of the podium from laps 4 to 18 until Crutchlow lost the front end of his M1 at the first corner. He remounted and continued the race as did Dovizioso, who suffered the same fate with four laps to go. After breaking free of both the Tech 3 riders, Rossi slashed the advantage Stoner had built up during the fighting and reeled him in over the remaining ten laps. On the penultimate lap, Rossi tried to overtake Stoner on the fast left-right combination at the beginning of the track but ran wide and Stoner retook the position.

At the opening round in Qatar he had a competitive pace all weekend but lost out badly with the new qualifying format, demoting him to seventh place on race day. He quickly fought himself back to fourth on the opening lap, but ran wide when he tried to overtake Ducati replacement rider Andrea Dovizioso, once again dropping him back to seventh place. His podium chances continued to worsen when he got stuck behind Stefan Bradl but once he passed him, he defied the odds by bridging a three-second gap to Cal Crutchlow, Dani Pedrosa and rookie Marc M\u00e1rquez who were fighting for second place. Rossi passed both Crutchlow and Pedrosa, but M\u00e1rquez' aggressive riding style and determination led to a battle between the two. M\u00e1rquez overtook Rossi on the penultimate lap, with Rossi repassing him on the final lap to stay in front and cross the line ahead of the Spanish rookie with 0.211 seconds. At the next two races at the Americas and Spain, Rossi finished in sixth and fourth position. At the French round, he finished a disappointing twelfth. He started the race from eighth on the grid and moved up to third to grab another podium but lost the position to Cal Crutchlow and then slid out of contention with ten laps to go.

Another wet race in the Czech Republic saw Rossi go against the majority of the field in choosing the harder rear wet tyre. Initially it seemed an error as he fell from 6th to 12th but he recovered throughout the race to finish second to Cal Crutchlow. Great Britain saw Rossi line up second on the grid behind pole-sitter Crutchlow and following an intense battle with M\u00e1rquez, eventually finishing third behind Crutchlow and first-time race winner Maverick Vi\u00f1ales. A week later Rossi finished second at his \"home race\" in San Marino. After leading for the majority of the race he was overhauled by Dani Pedrosa in the closing laps. Rossi again led for a period in Arag\u00f3n before eventually finishing third.", "For the season opener in Qatar however, he appeared to make a breakthrough, moving from tenth on the grid to finish third. Rossi continued his improvement by taking back-to-back second place podiums in Argentina after a battle with Cal Crutchlow for second place and the Americas to take the lead of the championship after three races by six points.", "In September 2020, after six months of speculation, Rossi confirmed that he would be joining Petronas Yamaha SRT for the 2021 season alongside his VR46 Academy prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Franco Morbidelli. This is the first time that Rossi raced with a satellite team since 2001 \u2013 which was when he clinched his first-ever premier class world title.
