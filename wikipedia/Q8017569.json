The quality of the bank's architecture is a good barometer of the wealth that came from being the sole financial depository within a large rural area.  The building dates from 1853. It seems that the highly fashionable Gothic revival had not yet reached Aylesbury, as the owners of the bank selected an Italianate classical style.  The ground floor is rusticated but the blocks of ashlar are imitation, as is the quoining on the floors above.  The upper floor, which would have been the banks administrative offices, suggests a piano nobile, with tall sash windows crowned by segmental pediments.  The Bank standing on the junction of Market Square and Kingsbury Square has a canted facade in order to suit the triangular junction cause by the meeting of the two squares and a common street.  The building in style is very reminiscent of those buildings of Thomas Cubitt and Edward Blore in London at this period.  The possibility of a notable architect is likely as in nearby Leighton Buzzard the great Gothic revival architect Alfred Waterhouse was commissioned to design an equally small provincial bank (the Basset Bank) in the town's High Street and there was great rivalry between the small rural banks.  The appearance of the Bank itself was seen not only as a sign of prestige, but also financial security, both evaluated by small local businessmen and farmers when entrusting their money."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1830 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Rickford||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Rickford||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1826 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Rickford||Whig"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Rickford||Whig"]}, {"page": "Rickford, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Rickford"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|  William Rickford"]}]}}
