It was also reported in 1934 that she was regularly at the baby welfare centre at Dudley, where she helped local mothers with babies.  On 2 September 1937 she married  Dr Douglas Leigh Little, a medical practitioner, at the Wesley Methodist Church in Dudley. The bridesmaid was the tennis player Mary Heeley and the wedding dress was designed by Ted Tinling, who later became famous for creating sportswear for many of the post-war ladies' tennis champions. In July 1938, Round gave birth to a boy in Dudley. She went to Canada with her baby son in 1940, returning to the UK in 1944. She gave birth to a daughter, Patricia, in 1946. After Round's tennis playing career ended in 1950, she became a keen golf player and played in golf tournaments during the 1950s. On 4 April 1958, Round's husband died at their home in St. James Road, Dudley. In August 1958, she was appointed a J.P. in her home town of Dudley.
