McCormack also appeared in several feature films during his career.\nMcCormack was probably best known for his recurring role as Alan in the 1984 science fiction series Chocky and for playing Kevin Masters in EastEnders.\nMcCormack's electric presence and square jaw coupled with his imposing athletic build usually saw him typecast as a soldier or policeman. He nonetheless appeared in a wide range of roles including Man About the House, The Good Life and Yes, Minister. He also tutored and coached at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama where his students included Ewan McGregor, Daniel Craig and Damian Lewis.McCormack died of cancer aged 62 after a short illness, following a tour of Romeo and Juliet in Hong Kong with the Royal Shakespeare Company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1995 in film", "response": ["| First Knight || Columbia Pictures / Zucker Brothers Productions || Jerry Zucker (director); William Nicholson (screenplay); Sean Connery, Richard Gere, Julia Ormond, Ben Cross, John Gielgud, Liam Cunningham, Christopher Villiers, Valentine Pelka, Colin McCormack, Alexis Denisof, Ralph Ineson, Stuart Bunce, Angus Wright, Owain Griffiths || Period || Live action"]}, {"page": "2004 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19 || Colin McCormack || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 62 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Peggy Mitchell", "response": ["Peggy married Eric Mitchell because she was pregnant with their son Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Eric grew to be a keen boxer and he soon ended up working for his gangland boss, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). This impacted the marriage as Johnny constantly taunted Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric was a better boxer than him. Eric fell in love with a glamorous woman called Maureen Loftus and planned to elope with her, but he changed his mind at the last minute \u2013 unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil. The abuse eventually ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a Post Office robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and Grant (Ross Kemp) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. It was then Eric had cheated on Peggy with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who he also intended to run away with, but he changed his mind again \u2013 leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Soon afterwards, Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother Archie (Larry Lamb) for comfort because he was there for Peggy when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 \u2013 her only daughter Samantha (Danniella Westbrook; Kim Medcalf). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when Kevin Masters (Colin McCormack) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, they ended up having a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him until he eventually died in 1985.
