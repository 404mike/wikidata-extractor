Having played 45 matches for Leeds at League One level and once in the Championship, he transferred to Premier League club Aston Villa in August 2009 for \u00a36 million. In 2012, he returned to Leeds for a short loan spell. Delph had a successful start to the 2012\u201313 Premier League season, leading Villa manager Paul Lambert to call for his inclusion in the England squad. In July 2015, Delph joined Manchester City for \u00a38 million.\nDelph represented England at under-19 and under-21 level and made his senior debut in a friendly against Norway on 3 September 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1989", "response": ["* November 21 \u2013 Fabian Delph, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Aston Villa F.C.", "response": ["In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of \u00a353.9\u00a0million, and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later. With Lerner still on board, but unwilling to spend following the stock market crash of 2008, the club was uncompetitive for several seasons, culminating in the 2014\u201315 season, when Lambert was sacked in February 2015 after the team managed just 12 goals in the first 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history. Tim Sherwood succeeded him, and steered the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final. However,  the club sold two of its star players Christian Benteke and captain Fabian Delph in the summer transfer window and did not adequately replace them. Villa struggled in the 2015\u201316 season, and Sherwood was sacked following six consecutive defeats.  He was replaced by R\u00e9mi Garde, a French manager with no Premier League experience. He left after five months with Villa lying at the bottom of the table; his reign included a woeful club-record 19 game winless run. The club was relegated at the end of the season, ending their 29-year stay in the top flight."]}, {"page": "Pitch invasion", "response": ["* Aston Villa v West Bromwich Albion (7 March 2015) FA Cup. Near the end of this FA Cup quarter-final between two fierce Midlands rivals, many Villa fans decided to invade the pitch before the final whistle had been blown. The referee halted the game before resuming. Upon the final whistle, both sets of fans ran on to the pitch. Aston Villa player Fabian Delph claimed he was bitten by a fan and other players were in danger of being attacked. Aston Villa fans were heavily criticised by the media for their actions with links being drawn to the frequent hooliganism of English football in the 1970s; 17 men were arrested on public offences. Aston Villa were later charged by the FA for their failure to sufficiently control the chaos."]}, {"page": "Ron Vlaar", "response": ["Ahead of the 2014\u201315 season, Vlaar said his new target for the new season is to help Aston Villa to win silverware. For his performance in the FIFA World Cup, Vlaar was linked away from the club, with clubs, such as, Queens Park Rangers and Lazio were interested in signing him. Following talks with manager Lambert, he ended up staying at Aston Villa. Vlaar started the 2014\u201315 season well when he helped the club make a good start to win the first three league matches of the season. However, Vlaar suffered a calf injury during a 2\u20131 win against Hull City on 31 August 2014 and was sidelined for a month. It wasn't until on 18 October 2014 when he made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Everton and played the whole game, as Aston Villa lost 3\u20130. However, his return was short\u2013lived when Vlaar suffered a calf injury while on international duty and was sidelined for weeks. Vlaar made his return to the first team from injury, coming on as a 78th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 loss against West Bromwich Albion on 13 December 2014. Once again, his return was short\u2013lived when he suffered a knee injury during a 0\u20130 draw against Crystal Palace on 1 January 2015 and was substituted in the 15th minute. After the match, it was announced that Vlaar would be out for six weeks. While on the sidelines, he was linked with a move away from the club, with Juventus, Liverpool and Manchester United wanted to sign him. In response, Manager Lambert said Aston Villa will not sell Vlaar in the January transfer window, which, he agreed and announcing his intention to see out his contract. Vlaar made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Leicester City in the fifth round of the FA Cup on 15 February 2015 and set up the first goal of the game, in a 2\u20131 win. In a follow\u2013up match against Stoke City, he was sent\u2013off for a second bookable offence, in a 2\u20131 loss. Shortly after serving his suspension, Vlaar suffered a calf injury that saw him out for a month. He made his return to the starting line\u2013up and played the whole game, in a 3\u20133 draw against Queens Park Rangers on 7 April 2015. Vlaar then relinquished his captaincy role to Fabian Delph for the rest of the 2014\u201315 season and played his first match without an armband, in a 2\u20131 win against Liverpool in the semi\u2013finals of the FA Cup. Following this, he formed a central defence partnership with Jores Okore and the pair even played together in the 2015 FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, where the team were defeated 4\u20130 by Arsenal on 30 May 2015. At the end of the 2014\u201315 season, Vlaar went on to make twenty\u2013three appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "response": ["Agbonlahor scored his first goal of the 2011\u201312 season in Aston Villa's 3\u20131 home win over Blackburn Rovers on 20 August 2011, and followed this up with the leveller in a 2\u20132 away draw against Everton ten days later. For his positive performances during the opening month of the season, Agbonlahor was named as Aston Villa's Player of the Month for August 2011, beating off competition from Fabian Delph to the top spot. He then made it three goals in three matches when he scored in a 1\u20131 home draw against Newcastle on 17 September. This meant that Agbonlahor had equalled his Premier League goals tally from the 2010\u201311 season after just five matches into the new season."]}, {"page": "1989 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 21 November \u2013 Fabian Delph, English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["| Fabian Delph || MF || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 14 || style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-value=\"20\" | 20 (5) || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 0 || style=\"text-align:center;\" | \u2013\u2013 ||  || ||  || style=\"text-align:center;\" | "]}, {"page": "Jonny Howson", "response": ["The following season saw high hopes for Howson but he ultimately struggled to find his form.

Blackpool manager Simon Grayson succeeded McAllister and Howson was mostly restricted to substitute appearances for his first ten games. He eventually returned to the side in February, scoring both goals in Leeds' 2\u20130 victory over Cheltenham Town. He gradually re-established himself as a first team regular with Fabian Delph being moved out to a wide left midfield position.
