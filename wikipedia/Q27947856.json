They resolved to see what the cracked dam was worth, quite literally. In 1884, with initial safety testing, immediate repairs, and controlled filling, the existing structure held a pool about seven feet above the natural level. The cost to this work, totaled \u00a326,000; the increased water provided to canals produced 30,000 tons more cotton than the previous year, which was worth over \u00a31 million. This was so encouraging that, the following year, Lord Cromer, despite the state of finances, provided \u00a31 million to improve Egypt's irrigation works.Hollings, Mary Albright, The life of Sir Colin C. Scott-Moncrieff, (1917) Between 1885 and 1890, Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff successfully completed repairs of the barrages at a cost of $2.5 million; it provided a maintainable and desired depth of eight feet of water on downstream parts of the Nile.S. Rappoport, History Of Egypt From 330 B.C.

All the major dams controlling the Nile (the Old Aswan Dam and Esna, Nag Hammadi, Assiut, Edfeina and Zifta barrages) were constructed during this period. The venerable Delta Barrage, was finally replaced in 1939 by the newly constructed Mohammed Ali Barrage several hundred meters downstream from the original barrage location, and would again be relegated to the status of a romantic river crossing.Samir Raafat, The Delta Barrage, Cairo Times, 21 August 1997 Harold Edwin Hurst's work in Egypt started in 1906 and lasted 62 years doing his best work after he reached 65. He championed the prelude to the new Aswan High Dam project which was built using his calculations of the required long-term storage capacity."]}, {"page": "Greyfriars Kirkyard", "response": ["* Robert Scott Moncrieff (1793\u20131869) advocate and amateur artist and his son Colin Scott-Moncrieff (CP)"]}, {"page": "Irrigation in India", "response": ["Major irrigation canals were built after millions of people died each in a series of major famines in the 19th century in British India. In 1900, British India (including Bangladesh and Pakistan) had about 13 million ha under irrigation. In 1901 the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, appointed a Commission chaired by Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff to draw up a comprehensive irrigation plan for India. In 1903 the Commission's report recommended irrigation of an additional 2.6 million hectares. By 1947, the irrigated area had increased to about 22 million ha. In Northwestern British India region alone, with the colonial government's effort, 2.2 million hectares of previously barren land was irrigated by the 1940s, most of which is now part of Pakistan. Arthur Cotton led some irrigation canal projects in the Deccan peninsula, and landmarks are named after him in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. However, much of the added irrigation capacity during the colonial era was provided by groundwater wells and tanks, operated manually.Edward Balfour, , pp. 377-380"]}, {"page": "George Kenneth Scott-Moncrieff", "response": ["Scott-Moncrieff was born in Bengal, British India, the younger son of Maj.
