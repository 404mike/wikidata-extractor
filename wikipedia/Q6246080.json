He was initially a school teacher, but then became a Church of Scotland minister.  He was the father of George Campbell Hay, the Scottish Gaelic poet.\nHe is mainly known for his novel Gillespie, set in a fictionalised version of his home town of Tarbert.  It received favourable reviews when it was published in 1914, but was largely forgotten until it was re-discovered in the late 20th century.  He also wrote a second novel Barnacles, and a collection of poems.\nIn poor health for much of his adult life, he died of tuberculosis at the age of only 39.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1914 in literature", "response": ["*John MacDougall Hay \u2013 Gillespie"]}, {"page": "George Campbell Hay", "response": ["He was born in Elderslie, Renfrewshire, and brought up in Tarbert, Kintyre and Argyll, where his father, the novelist John MacDougall Hay, had been born.
