Tomkins spent little over a year as a missionary in Papua New Guinea before he died a violent death alongside James Chalmers (\"Tamate\") in 1901.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Yarmouth", "response": ["*Oliver Fellows Tomkins (1873-1901) missionary, eaten by cannibals in Papua"]}, {"page": "James Chalmers (missionary)", "response": ["After Chalmers' return to New Guinea, he did a great deal of exploring and gained a detailed knowledge of much of the country and its inhabitants. When British New Guinea was made a colony in 1888, Chalmers and his fellow missionary, the Rev. William G. Lawes, explained to the chiefs the meaning of the functions that were held. It had been decided that the colony should be governed in the best interests of the natives. It was no doubt largely the influence of the missionaries that made it illegal both to deport natives and to introduce intoxicants, fire-arms, and explosives. In 1893, Chalmers explored part of the Fly River in a steam launch, but found the natives extremely hostile. He had another furlough in 1894-5 and did much speaking in Great Britain. He also published Pioneer Life and Work in New Guinea 1877-1894 (1895), which contained a considerable amount of material from earlier books. Back at his work in 1896, Chalmers was anxious to further explore the Fly River and established himself for some time at Saguane off the Fly River delta. His last station was Daru. In April 1900 he was joined by a young missionary, Oliver Fellows Tomkins (son of Daniel Tomkins of Great Yarmouth - a plaque is situated in the United Reformed Church, Princes St, Norwich to Tomkins's memory). A year later, he was on a vessel with Tomkins near Goaribari Island, and was visited by natives who appeared to be in a dangerous mood. Chalmers resolved to go ashore and Tomkins insisted on going with him. Both men were murdered and eaten by the natives on 8 April 1901. There is a stained glass window to their memory in the college chapel at Vatorato. Chalmers is also included on a stained glass window in the Eltham College chapel in Mottingham, England."]}, {"page": "List of incidents of cannibalism", "response": ["*The Protestant missionaries James Chalmers and Oliver Fellows Tomkins were murdered and cannibalized on Goaribari Island, Papua New Guinea on April 8, 1901."]}, {"page": "Goaribari Island", "response": ["On 8 April 1901, the Revs. James Chalmers and Oliver Fellows Tomkins (1873\u20131901), together with ten missionary students, were murdered with stone implements and cannibalized by the natives of this island, at Dopima village when they tried to preach to the natives and convert them; their bones were hung as trophies."]}, {"page": "April 1901", "response": ["* James Chalmers, 59, and Oliver Fellows Tomkins, 28, both Scottish missionaries, went ashore on Goaribari Island in New Guinea with eleven Papuan assistants. After arriving, they were invited by islanders to come into a longhouse, where they were clubbed to death, then eaten, by cannibals. In retaliation, British colonial officials dispatched troops from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea who killed at least 24 of the tribesmen, then burned the longhouses in the village. In 1903, an expedition would be sent to search for Tomkins's skull, and more villages would be killed."]}]}}
