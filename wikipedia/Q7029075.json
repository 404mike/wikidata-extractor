Clare Short called the end of Page 3 in The Sun \"an important public victory for dignity\", while Nicky Morgan, then serving as Minister for Women and Equalities, called the move \"a small but significant step towards improving the media portrayal of women and girls\". Caroline Lucas welcomed the decision to discontinue topless images but criticized the transition to clothed glamour, saying: \"So long as The Sun reserves its right to print the odd topless shot, and reserves its infamous page for girls clad in bikinis, the conversation isn't over\". Others defended the feature and the women who posed for it, with glamour model Nicola McLean telling ITV's Good Morning Britain that: \"[Page 3 models] are all very strong-minded women that have made our own choice and feel very happy with what we are doing. We certainly don't feel like we have been victimised\". In a televised debate with Harriet Harman and Germaine Greer, model Chloe Goodman asked: \"Why should feminist women tell other women how to live their lives?\" Harman responded: \"In a hundred years' time, if you look back at the newspapers of this country, and you see women standing in their knickers with their breasts showing, what would you think about women's role in society?\" Goodman replied: \"What do we think of women and men a thousand years ago, when we see statues [of them] nude?

The documentary saw Bridge track down the trolls and confront them about the messages they have been sending. Bridge also met with a family who were sent awful messages after their son went missing, and it made viewers on Twitter absolutely furious about the messages the family were receiving. Bridge decided to do the show after she received death threats through social media after splitting up with previous partner Dougie Poynter. In September 2017, Bridge took part in television show Married to a Celebrity, where she appeared with her husband Wayne Bridge."]}, {"page": "List of The Podge and Rodge Show episodes", "response": ["| 4 || 28 || Nicola McLean, The High Kings ||  || 2009-03-03"]}, {"page": "List of Big Brother (British TV series) shows", "response": ["* Nicola McLean (2011\u201318)"]}, {"page": "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!
