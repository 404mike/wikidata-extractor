Julian Forte and Senoj-Jay Givans, two sub-10 runners, filled out the Jamaican squad.

In the third semi-final, Christian Coleman surprised the world by beating Bolt with 9.97 to his 9.98, despite it being a semi-final; in doing so, he became the first man in four years to beat Bolt, the last being Gatlin by the same margin (0.01) in an IAAF Diamond League event in Rome.
