The following year he had the second big success of his theatrical career. The actor and playwright Sacha Guitry invited him to write the music for a new com\u00e9die musicale called Mozart. The piece was loosely based on the early life of the composer, and was to star Guitry and his wife, Yvonne Printemps, the latter en travesti as the young Mozart. Hahn agreed, and composed a score incorporating various extracts from Mozart's works along with his own original music. The show opened in December 1925 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00c9douard VII, receiving enthusiastic reviews: Messager, writing in Le Figaro called it \"a piece of rare quality\", and commented that the score was so good that it was hard to detect where Mozart's music ended and Hahn's began: this, he said, was the highest possible praise.Messager, Andr\u00e9 \"Les premi\u00e8res\", Le Figaro, 3 December 1925, p. 4 The show was a popular success in Paris, with, for the time, an excellent run of seven months.\"Guitry Season\", The Stage, 24 June 1926, p. 16 The Guitrys then took the production to London in 1926, where it was well received.\"His Majesty's Theatre\", The Times, 25 June 1929, p. 14; \"A Playgoer's Notebook\", The Graphic, 3 July 1926, p. 29 At the end of that year there were two versions running on Broadway: the Guitry company played the French original for a limited season,\"Mozart\", Internet Broadway Database.
