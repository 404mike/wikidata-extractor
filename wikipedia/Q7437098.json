Huybrechts lost 5\u20136 to Michael van Gerwen in the sixth 2013 UK Open Qualifier of the year in April. He went one better in the seventh event, sealing his first title on the PDC tour with a 6\u20132 win over John Part in the final having earlier exacted his revenge over van Gerwen in the fifth round by beating him 6\u20134. His performances after all eight events had been played saw him finish third on the UK Open Order of Merit, but he lost 6\u20139 to Terry Jenkins in the fourth round. Huybrechts was the victim of clinical finishing in the first round of the World Grand Prix as Andy Hamilton hit six out of six doubles to beat him 2\u20130 in sets. However, less than two weeks later he claimed his second Pro Tour title of 2013 at the 12th Players Championship by whitewashing Kevin Painter 6\u20130 in the final which included a 170 checkout in the second leg. He then took the final spot for the Winners Group of the Championship League by winning Group 8 with a 6\u20134 success over Peter Wright in the final. There, Huybrechts won three of his seven games to finish sixth in the eight man table. The biggest title of Huybrechts' career to date followed as he claimed the Dutch Darts Masters in Veldhoven.

He faced Adrian Lewis in the first round and missed two darts at tops in the deciding leg to lose 6\u20135 despite an average of 106.43. Despite only winning one of his three group games at the Grand Slam of Darts, Huybrechts finished second to qualify for the last 16 on leg difference.
