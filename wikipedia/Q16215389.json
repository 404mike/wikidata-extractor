It is a work comprising six movements. It is based on around a dozen well-known melodies from the rock band Queen. These include \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", the latter including a performance by Nicola Loud. Some critics have compared the overall effect with the work of John Williams, notably his Star Wars score. Others have considered the choral elements of the Queen Symphony to be a nod to the rock band's own lavish tendencies, in addition to Kashif's spell as musical director of the London Amadeus Choir. The piece has been performed regularly and in 2004 received US and Dutch premi\u00e8res. The tonal language of the symphony is diverse and draws on much of the Western classical tradition, with Kashif himself listing influences as diverse as medieval music, Romantic music and opera.Kashif (2002). There are concertante passages for piano in the second movement, and for violin and cello in the third."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the Royal Academy of Music", "response": ["* Nicola Loud (violinist)"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Young Musicians", "response": ["| Nicola Loud", "| Nicola Loud"]}]}}
