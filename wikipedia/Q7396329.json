After feeling sorry for Rimmer, Lister visited the Hologram Suite intending to give him a present, uploading a memory of his own recounting his eight months with Lise Yates (Sabra Williams), an old girlfriend, and making it one of Rimmer's. The following morning, Rimmer woke in a jubilant mood but questioned elements of his new memories he now had. His happiness was soon broken when he found Lise's letters to Lister and assumed she was dating them both, forcing Lister to reveal what he did. Seeing him distraught and hurt from the truth, despite his best efforts to comfort him, Lister decided the group should erase all traces of the past few days from their memories.

The live action footage of the scene was merged with model footage of Blue Midget and Red Dwarf, which was seen in the distant background. During the pre-record filming of the episode, Craig Charles's then-wife was giving birth to their son Jack; Craig filmed the scenes where Lister's face was visible as quickly as possible and then rushed away to be at the birth of his son (arriving twenty minutes late). The remainder of location shooting, in which Lister was wearing a space-suit, had production manager Mike Agnew as the double for Lister.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 9-10. But in fact the plaster cast couldn't fit Agnew's foot as he had bigger feet than Craig Charles\u00a0\u2013 a close look at the episode would reveal that there are several frames in the episode where neither the Cat nor Lister (stood in by Agnew) had casts. To film Lister's drunken pilot skills on the flight back to Red Dwarf, wires were used by the model team to give the jerking motion.
