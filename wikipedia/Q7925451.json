During the competition she heard the song \"Io Che Non Vivo (Senza Te)\", performed by one of its composers, Pino Donaggio, and separately by US country music singer Jody Miller.Gulla, p. 365. An English-language version, \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\", would feature lyrics newly written by Springfield's friend (and future manager) Vicki Wickham and another future manager, Simon Napier-Bell. Springfield's dramatic recording of the ballad was released in March 1966 and reached number one in the UK in its fifth week on the singles chart. Success followed in the US, where in July it reached no. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100, ranking 21 for the year. Springfield called it \"good old schmaltz\", and it became her signature song. In 1967 Springfield was nominated for the Best Contemporary (R&R) Solo Vocal Performance \u2013 Male or Female award at the 9th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Paul McCartney for \"Eleanor Rigby\". In 1999 \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\" featured in an all-time Top 100 of songs as voted for by listeners of BBC Radio 2.", "During this period, Springfield was also known for her love of Motown. She introduced the Motown sound to a wider UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for the Temptations, the Supremes, the Miracles and Stevie Wonder in a special edition of the 1963\u201366 British TV music series Ready Steady Go!, produced by Vicki Wickham.Randall, (Fall 2005). The Sound of Motown was broadcast by Associated-Rediffusion/ITV on 28 April 1965, with Springfield opening each half accompanied by Martha and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, the Funk Brothers. The associated touring Tamla-Motown Revue \u2013 featuring the Supremes, the Miracles and Stevie Wonder \u2013 had started in London in March and was, according to the Supremes' Mary Wilson, a flop: \"It's always\u00a0... disheartening when you go out there and you see the house is half-full\u00a0... but once you're on stage\u00a0... You perform as well for five as you do for 500.\" Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it."]}, {"page": "Labelle", "response": ["Supremes in 1967, the group, following the advice of Vicki Wickham, changed its look, musical direction, and style to re-form as Labelle in 1971. Their funk rock recordings of that period became cult favorites for their brash interpretation of rock and roll and for dealing with subject matter that was not typically touched by female black groups. Finally \u2013 after adapting glam rock and wearing outlandish space-age and glam costumes \u2013 the group found success with the proto-disco smash \"Lady Marmalade\" in 1974, leading to their album Nightbirds, which achieved gold success. They are notable for being the first contemporary pop group and first black pop group to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House. They were also the first black vocal group to appear on the cover of Rolling Stone.", "Around this time, the group also began touring Europe, mainly in the UK, where they performed on the show, Ready, Steady, Go. During club performances, the group was backed up musically by a pub band called Bluesology, whose pianist was a teenager named Reg Dwight, later known as Elton John. Following the UK tour, the group kept in touch with one of the show's producers, Vicki Wickham. In early 1967, the group had another charted single with the song \"Take Me for a Little While\" and released their second Atlantic album, Dreamer. Around this time, Aretha Franklin had signed with Atlantic Records, leading Atlantic to focus its efforts on her rather than on the Blue Belles. That same year, Cindy Birdsong abruptly left the group to join The Supremes, replacing original member Florence Ballard. After completing a tour where Sundray Tucker briefly rejoined the group to fill in for Birdsong, the remaining members carried on as a trio.", "As grittier soul and heavy rock dominated much of Atlantic's time, the group was let go from their contract in 1970. Bernard Montague, who was managing groups such as The Delfonics, also left them, leaving them seeking new managers. After nearly signing a contract with Herb Hamlett and Frankie Crocker, they eventually picked Vicki Wickham to work with them. Wickham later credited Dusty Springfield with convincing her to hire the group to perform on Ready, Steady, Go in London."]}, {"page": "Patti LaBelle", "response": ["That year, Vicki Wickham, producer of the UK music show Ready, Steady, Go, agreed to manage the group after Dusty Springfield mentioned signing them. Wickham's first direction for the group was for them to change their name to simply Labelle and advised the group to renew their act, going for a more homegrown look and sound that reflected funk, rock and psychedelic soul. In 1971, the group opened for the Who in several stops on the group's U.S. tour."]}, {"page": "Nona Hendryx", "response": ["For the next three years, the group struggled to compete against the changing musical landscape for which their girl group sound had fallen out of favor with popular audiences. In 1971, they moved to England, where they had a cult fan base, and on the advice of Vicki Wickham, changed their name to Labelle and ditched the dresses and bouffant wigs for jeans and Afros. Releasing transitional albums including 1971's Labelle and 1972's Moon Shadow, the group recorded material that included sexual and political subject matter \u2013 unheard of for an all-female black group. The transition was hard for lead singer LaBelle, who was a fan of the group's early-era ballads, but she eventually gave in. Member Dash remained neutral throughout the tenure of the group. Shortly after releasing Labelle, the group became the opening act for The Who, whose producer Kit Lambert had produced the group's Warner debut. They also opened for Laura Nyro during that same time and sang backup on her album Gonna Take a Miracle.", "Hendryx's long-term partner is English talent manager Vicki Wickham.

The Yardbirds asked him if he would manage them. They were looking for a replacement for their original manager, Giorgio Gomelsky.

Much like The Supremes' Mary Wilson, Dash was often the \"middle\" of two of the group's extremes, Nona Hendryx and Patti LaBelle, who often had differed in the group's change of direction before LaBelle eventually agreed to \"go along with it\".
