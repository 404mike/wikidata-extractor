He signed a new contract in June 2005 which resulted in a pay cut but guaranteed him a testimonial; manager Paul Merson said that: \"this is a real boost to us because when he's fit his name is first on the team sheet\". Wrack broke his leg following a challenge by Colin Miles during a 2\u20131 defeat to Yeovil Town in September 2005. It took him 13 months to return to full fitness, during which time Walsall were relegated. He marked his return to action with a last-minute goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Swansea City in a Football League Trophy tie on 17 October 2006. However, he pulled his hamstring during a 1\u20130 win over Hereford United on 18 November, which was only his second league start in a year. New manager Richard Money led the club to the League Two title in the 2006\u201307 season. Wrack was given a testimonial match against Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Bescot Stadium in April 2008, which attracted only 1,330 supporters. Both Wrack and long-time teammate Ian Roper were released by the club the following month; this was despite Wrack playing 44 games during the 2007\u201308 season."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["Craddock extended his loan from Middlesbrough by another month soon after.
