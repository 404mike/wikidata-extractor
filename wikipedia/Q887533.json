Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of \u00a316\u00a0million, despite the \u00a318\u00a0million sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United. Some were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright. Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu; Davor \u0160uker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; Christian Bassila, who cost \u00a3720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football; Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to \u00a34.4\u00a0million but made only three starts for the club; Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre; and Marco Boogers, a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks, while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the season's end."]}, {"page": "Paul Gascoigne", "response": ["Gascoigne was named on the PFA Team of the Year in the 1990\u201391 season as Tottenham reached the FA Cup Final, with victories over Blackpool, Oxford United, Portsmouth, Notts County and North London derby rivals Arsenal. He scored the opening goal of the 3\u20131 victory over Arsenal at Wembley with a free-kick, one of six goals he scored in the competition. Spurs at this juncture were also under significant financial strain with huge \u00a310 million debt. With Spurs being tied to massive debt, Spurs hired a financial advisor called Nat Solomon. Solomon strongly argued for selling Gascoigne to Lazio to keep the vultures at bay. Going into the final against Nottingham Forest, Spurs had readily accepted an offer from Lazio and Gascoigne had already agreed to the playing terms to join the Italian club. The deal would be worth \u00a38.5\u00a0million to Tottenham. His final was to end in injury however as 15 minutes into the game he committed a dangerous knee-high foul on Gary Charles and ruptured his own cruciate ligaments in his right knee. England teammate Stuart Pearce scored from the resultant free-kick, and Gascoigne subsequently collapsed after the kick-off, forcing him to leave the match on a stretcher. Tottenham went on to win the Cup in extra-time."]}, {"page": "Graeme Souness", "response": ["In November 1997, Souness was appointed by Benfica's new chairman Jo\u00e3o Vale e Azevedo, who promised to return the club to its former glory. The Scottish manager brought several British players from the Premier League, including defenders Steve Harkness and Gary Charles, midfielders Michael Thomas and Mark Pembridge and forwards Dean Saunders and Brian Deane, as well as refusing to sign emerging talent Deco. 18 months later, Souness left the club and stated, \"Vale e Azevedo lies when he looks in the eyes.

The new look Villa team gelled well, and 1995\u201396 was a successful season at Villa Park.

Gascoigne was so pumped up for this match that he almost ended his involvement in the first few minutes. In winning the ball out on the right touchline, he followed through with his foot up and caught Garry Parker in the chest. Referee Roger Milford let him off with a lecture, but failed to calm Gascoigne, who scythed down Gary Charles as the Forest defender ran across the face of the Spurs penalty area.

The match is best remembered for the antics of Spurs playmaker Paul Gascoigne, whose high tickle on Garry Parker after just two minutes might have been expected to have merited an automatic red card, but was let off with a caution from referee Roger Milford. Soon afterwards Gascoigne ruptured his cruciate ligament while making another horror tackle on Gary Charles. He again escaped a red card, but was stretchered off the pitch and was out of action for a year afterwards. Pearce put Forest ahead after 16 minutes direct from a free kick and Mark Crossley saved a Gary Lineker penalty, becoming only the second player to do so in an FA Cup final. Paul Stewart equalised after 55 minutes and the match went into extra time. Clough opted not to talk to the players before extra time, instead remaining on the bench. Spurs ultimately won 2\u20131 after Des Walker inadvertently put the ball into his own net.

On 30 May 2008 Rob Earnshaw became the first player to move directly between the two clubs for 15 years (since Gary Charles in 1993) when he agreed to a \u00a32.65m deal to join Forest from the Rams less than a year after moving to Pride Park. The move was followed three days later by Forest winger Kris Commons moving to Pride Park, though he was released by Forest first meaning he did not move directly between the two clubs.

After overcoming Millwall 5\u20131 on aggregate in the semifinal legs, and surviving a pitch invasion in the 3\u20131 win at the New Den, Derby came up against local rivals Leicester City at Wembley. Despite taking the lead through Tommy Johnson, Derby lost 2\u20131 after a double from Steve Walsh and missed out on promotion yet again. Derby had built a side which seemed to be consistently achieving less than the sum of its parts, with Gary Charles, a former England international, Craig Short, Paul Williams, Mark Pembridge, Paul Kitson and Tommy Johnson all keen to test themselves at a higher level. Several of these players left during the 1994\u201395 season, Kitson joining Newcastle United for \u00a32.25m, Charles and Johnson moving to Aston Villa for a combined \u00a32.9m and Pembridge moving to Sheffield Wednesday. The side was also weakened when goalkeeper Martin Taylor, an ever-present the previous season and touted for a place in the England squad, broke his leg in a 1\u20130 defeat at Southend United and was out of action for the next 29 months. With chairman Lionel Pickering's increased frustration at no return on his investment, the purse strings were tightened and McFarland was unable to buy suitable replacements, instead blooding youth products such as Dean Sturridge, Russell Hoult and Lee Carsley to fill the gaps created by the departures. In the event Derby could only record a 9th-place finish and McFarland, in the knowledge his contract was not going to be renewed, said his goodbye's in the penultimate match of the season, a 2\u20131 home defeat at Southend United, ending a 28-year association with the club, broken only by a two-year spell as player-manager at Bradford City."]}]}}
