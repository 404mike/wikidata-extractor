A right-handed opening batsman for Lancashire and England, and occasional leg-break bowler, he achieved the captaincy of England at the age of 25 and led the side in a record 54 Test matches. Known for his stubborn resistance during an era of hostile fast bowling, Atherton was described in 2001 as a determined defensive opener who made \"batting look like trench warfare\". He had several famed bouts with bowlers including South Africa's Allan Donald and Australia's Glenn McGrath. Atherton often played the anchor role at a time when England batting performances lacked consistency.His playing career included controversy, including ball tampering, and several brushes with the media with whom, by Atherton's own admission, he did not have a good understanding when he was a player. Often hampered by a chronic back complaint which was to contribute to the end of his career, Atherton was considered a leading England batsman during the 1990s. Following retirement he became a journalist and is a cricket commentator with Sky Sports, and chief cricket correspondent of The Times.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FEC", "response": ["* FEC, a nickname of Michael Atherton (born 1968), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Michael Atherton \u2013 Channel 4 2002\u20132005, talkSport 2002\u20132005, Sky Sports 2005\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Barmy Army", "response": ["On the first day of the 1994\u201395 Ashes Series at Adelaide Oval, a group of supporters of the English Cricket team during the lunch break headed to T-Shirt City  on Hindley Street and ordered 50 shirts saying \"Atherton's Barmy Army\" (after then-captain Michael Atherton) with the Union Jack emblazoned on the back.

Michael Atherton was at the crease when Donald began a spell of bowling both would later describe in their respective autobiographies as one of the most intense periods of Test Match Cricket they ever played. Donald bowled multiple bouncers to Atherton, but he survived several close chances to remain not out at the end of the day. The next day Atherton along with Alec Stewart were able to score the remaining runs, with Atherton finishing on 98.

Waugh appears to link this 'missing ingredient' to his dominance in county cricket, stating that \"prior to his Test debut his capacity to overcome hardship was never called upon\". Waugh also cites the aforementioned 1995 declaration by Michael Atherton as a possible reason for Hick's lack of success in Test cricket, stating that \"just as Hick's ... gifts were about to re-emerge, in stepped ...

The arrival of Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in 2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard-fought draw against the 1991 West Indies and a strong performance in the 1992 Cricket World Cup in which the England team finished as runners-up for the second consecutive World Cup, but landmark losses against Australia in 1990\u201391 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that Rod Marsh described England's pace attack at one point as \"pie throwers\". Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993, Gooch resigned to be replaced by Michael Atherton."]}, {"page": "London Library", "response": ["In May 2016 the Library marked the 175th anniversary of its foundation with a three-day literary festival, \"Words In The Square\", held in St James's Square.
