It later featured three female presenters - Janet Kelly (July\u2013December 1968), future BBC TV newsreader Jan Leeming (1970) and Michele Brown (who later married Gyles Brandreth).", "From 2 July 1968, Tom-Tom was hosted by former ATV London continuity announcer Norman Tozer, with Carrad remaining as part of the presentation team alongside John Earle and Janet Kelly. Motorsport was featured regularly on the series, with Carrad providing filmed reports from International Grand Prix events, and the series also boasted its own slot-car racetrack in the studio. Carrad's final appearance was on 27 May 1969, making his exit via a magician's disappearing cabinet. Tom-Tom returned in the autumn, with Jan Leeming joining the presentation team. The first edition of 1970 looked forward fifty years to the year 2020, and invited viewers to enter a futuristic fashion design competition. The series continued through 1970, with features including a film-making competition (Tozer would later write two books aimed at amateur photographers and film makers). The last edition was broadcast on 4 November 1970."]}, {"page": "Tozer (surname)", "response": ["* Norman Tozer (1934\u20132010), British television and radio presenter and reporter"]}]}}
