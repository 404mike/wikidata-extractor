When the club collapsed in 1888 he, along with other members, threw in their lot with \"The Magpies\", the nickname for Notts County. He signed in August 1888. A wing half with exceptional stamina, he was a difficult player to get past. He also excelled in heading, often getting his head in the way of goal-bound shots.

Wikipedia and Football Club History Database show that Notts Rangers played in the 1888\u201389 and 1889\u201390 FA Cup competitions and took part in the first season, 1889\u201390, of the Midland League."]}, {"page": "Charles Shelton (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlie Shelton"]}, {"page": "Notts Rangers F.C.", "response": ["Charlie Shelton was the club's only England international player, earning one cap in 1888.England Football Online"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Charlie Shelton"]}]}}
