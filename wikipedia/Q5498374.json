He commanded an infantry brigade in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) of 1914, was appointed to command 15th (Scottish) Division in the New Armies from 1915 to 1917, and then briefly commanded XIII Corps on the Western Front before being posted to a home command in the United Kingdom.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Flers\u2013Courcelette", "response": ["The 15th Division (Major-General Frederick McCracken) attacked with two battalions attached from the 23rd Division and the 45th Brigade on the right flank attacked with two battalions, one in support and three in reserve. The barrage was found to be very good and little resistance was met except at Tangle South and the Longueval\u2013Martinpuich road. The 46th Brigade on the left attacked with all four battalions and three in support and captured Factory Lane at  touch being gained with the Canadians on the left as patrols went along the western fringe of the village. A tank moved very slowly but attacked the Germans in Bottom Trench and Tangle Trench, silenced several machine-guns in Martinpuich and then returned to refuel, returning later carrying ammunition. The second tank was knocked out before reaching its jumping-off point. When the artillery lifted off the village at  both brigades sent patrols in and around  a 46th Brigade battalion dug in on the objective and at  a 45th Brigade battalion captured the north end of the village and the ruins were occupied by the 46th Brigade and outposts were established facing Courcelette. During the night, two fresh battalions relieved the front line and gained touch with the Canadians in Gunpit Trench and on the right flank touch was gained with the 50th Division at the Martin Alley\u2013Starfish Line junction."]}, {"page": "Battle of Le Transloy", "response": ["Late on 8 October, Rawlinson ordered another attack, once XV Corps had reached its objectives, anticipated to be by 12 October, when the Sixth Army expected to have captured Sailly-Saillisel to the south-east. The rain stopped early on 9 October and from  the weather was fine but the state of the ground made divisional reliefs slow and laborious. From  the XIV Corps replaced the 56th and 20th divisions with the 4th Division (Major-General W. Lambton) and the 6th Division (Major-General Charles Ross). In XV Corps the 41st Division was replaced by the 30th Division (Major-General J. S. M. Shea) and the 9th Division (Major-General William Furse) and 15th Division (Major-General Frederick McCracken) took over from the 47th and 23rd divisions in III Corps. The new division had little time to study the ground or dig assembly trenches and Furse was refused a 48-hour postponement.

The 142nd Brigade attacked Diagonal Trench again with the 1/21st London and the 1/22nd London, who crawled forward to rush the German garrison as soon as a one-minute hurricane bombardment lifted at  The 1/21st London advanced until about  short of Diagonal Trench with no losses, then massed machine-gun fire inflicted many casualties; few troops reached the trench. On the left flank, three companies of the 1/22nd London reached the trench against slight opposition but enfilade fire from the right flank made the trench untenable once dawn broke. The survivors managed to dig advanced posts up to  short of the objective and at the Eaucourt l'Abbaye\u2013Warlencourt road. Touch was gained with the 23rd Division on the left. The 47th (1/2nd London) and 23rd divisions were relieved by the 9th Division (Major-General William Furse) and 15th (Scottish) Division (Major-General Frederick McCracken) from 8 11 October, preparatory to another attack."]}, {"page": "George Montague Harper", "response": ["In June 1917 Wilson \u2013 who had himself just declined the job - recommended Harper for command of XIII Corps, but Haig appointed Frederick McCracken instead.Jeffery 2006, p. 194."]}, {"page": "XIII Corps (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* 1917\u20131918 Lieutenant-General Frederick McCrackenRobbins, p.65"]}, {"page": "McCracken (surname)", "response": ["* Frederick McCracken (1859-1949), British general"]}, {"page": "Order of battle for the Battle of the Somme", "response": ["| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\" |15th (Scottish) Division   ||colspan=\"2\" |Major-General Frederick McCracken"]}, {"page": "Scottish Command", "response": ["*1918 \u2013 1919 Lieutenant General Sir Frederick McCracken"]}, {"page": "F.

The British artillery returned fire soon after but dust and smoke obscured the front and made observation impossible. McCracken ordered the reserve brigade to readiness, moved a battalion to Noyelles and manned machine-guns in the Village Line. At  the Germans sprung a mine near  Redoubt and then the German artillery-fire on the Kink diminished and increased at the redoubt. British artillery also switched targets and a German infantry attack was repulsed by the artillery and the small-arms fire of the 11th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (11th Argylls)."]}, {"page": "Gordon Glover", "response": ["Glover was born in Edinburgh in 1908, the son of William Gordon Glover (1879-1945), an engineer, and his wife Florence Edith (n\u00e9e Hardie) (1878-1956).
