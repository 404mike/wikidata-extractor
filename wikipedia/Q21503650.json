G. Breslaw, Doctor Alexander Hamilton and Provincial America (Louisiana State University Press, 2008), , p. 41. Scottish composers known to be active in this period include: Alexander Munro (fl. c. 1732), James Foulis (1710\u201373) and Charles McLean (fl. c. 1737).J. R.

Wilson, Edinburgh (Lonely Planet, 3rd edn., 2004), , p. 33. In the mid-eighteenth century, a group of Scottish composers began to respond to Allan Ramsey's call to \"own and refine\" their own musical tradition, creating what James Johnson has characterised as the \"Scots drawing room style\", taking primarily Lowland Scottish tunes and adding simple figured basslines and other features from Italian music that made them acceptable to a middle-class audience. It gained momentum when major Scottish composers like James Oswald (1710\u201369) and William McGibbon (1690\u20131756) became involved around 1740. Oswald's Curious Collection of Scottish Songs (1740) was one of the first to include Gaelic tunes alongside Lowland ones, setting a fashion common by the middle of the century and helping to create a unified Scottish musical identity. However, with changing fashions there was a decline in the publication of collections of specifically Scottish collections of tunes, in favour of their incorporation into British collections.M.
