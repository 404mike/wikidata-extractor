He was considered one of the finest political interviewers in the history of British broadcasting, tenacious and ruthless. He won awards for broadcasting including the BAFTA Richard Dimbleby Award for television in 1986, and in 1991 was named ITV personality of the year. He was known for interviews of politicians, especially Margaret Thatcher. He was said to be her favourite interviewer, although he gave her tough interviews.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Callaghan", "response": ["On 28 March 1979, the House of Commons passed a motion of no-confidence by one vote, 311\u2013310, which forced Callaghan to call a general election that was held on 3 May. The Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher ran a campaign on the slogan \"Labour Isn't Working\" and won the election. Callaghan agreed to a proposal by Brian Walden, a former Labour MP who was by then a broadcaster, to take part in two televised debates with Margaret Thatcher to be produced by LWT with the intention that they would be broadcast on ITV on 22 & 29 April 1979. At the insistence of the Liberal Party, their leader David Steel was also invited to take participate in the prosed debates, and he also quickly accepted the offer. However Mrs Thatcher ultimately rejected the approach to take part in the debates, citing among other reasons her belief that the election was for a government, not a president. Her refusal meant that the debates did not go ahead."]}, {"page": "1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["A proposal for the two main party leaders to participate in two televised debates was put forward by former Labour MP turned broadcaster Brian Walden.

While Jim Callaghan immediately accepted Walden's proposal, Margaret Thatcher decided to \"wait a few days before replying\" to the invitation. According to The Glasgow Herald Some of Mrs Thatcher's advisers were concerned that she had more to lose from such debates, fearing that it would lead to a \"presidential-style 'Her or me' campaign\" which would see policy issues become of less importance. However it was also reported that the danger of declining was that Mrs Thatcher would be charged by Labour as being \"scared\" to face the Prime Minister.

Howe forced her to give conditions for entering the proposal for entry to the ERM in June 1989. Howe and Nigel Lawson threatened to resign; but she called his bluff by appointing John Major over his head. Howe resented having to give up the state residence of Chevening, in Kent on being effectively demoted to Lord President of the Council. He deeply resented leaving the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which was a job he had always coveted. When Lawson resigned it looked like a natural reshuffle, but Howe was frozen out of the inner circle. When Howe attended a meeting with the Queen he found to his surprise that Britain had joined the ERM before he had been informed about it\u00a0\u2013 the ERM had been Howe's policy. The pound sterling was thus pegged to the Deutsche Mark, instead of the US dollar and the consequence was that Britain's currency was pummelled into devaluation by a much stronger German economy. The option to leave cost Britain billions in 1992. But at the Rome Summit in October 1990, Thatcher was said to have exclaimed, in a fit of pique, \"no, no, no\" to the Delors Plan, and repeated the government's policy at Paris summit on 18\u201320 November. She also repeated the \"no, no, no\" message in the House of Commons on her return to Westminster. Howe had told Brian Walden (a former Labour MP) on ITV's Weekend World, that the \"government did not oppose the principle of a single currency\", which was factually inaccurate."]}, {"page": "The New Statesman", "response": ["Alan at one time proposed inverting the rallying cry of the American War of Independence by stating that \"No representation without taxation\" was a more fitting clarion call, believing people such as himself (the \"enterprising, over-taxed minority\") to be called on far too often to bail out other members of society. Alan used the same argument when proposing to cut off all social security payments to elderly people as he believes they should have considered how they would look after themselves instead of wasting their money on \"ghastly holidays in Blackpool\". When being interviewed by Brian Walden, Alan readily conceded that should he rule the UK, the rich would only pay tax on their cocaine, children would be forced to work in mills and the elderly and infirm would be left to die by the thousands."]}, {"page": "Quentin Davies", "response": ["He contested the 1977 Birmingham Ladywood by-election for the Conservatives.
