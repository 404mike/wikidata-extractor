Originally this term (also spelled Boorlo or Burrell) applied to Point Fraser in East Perth, and according to Robert Menli Lyon meant \"big swamp\". The present-day CBD (central business district) formed part of the territory of the Mooro, a Noongar clan, who at the time of British settlement had Yellagonga as their leader. The Mooro was one of several Noongar clans based around the Swan River, known collectively as the Whadjuk. The Whadjuk themselves were one of a larger group of fourteen tribes that formed the south-west socio-linguistic block known as the Noongar (meaning \"the people\" in their language), also sometimes called the Bibbulmun. On 19 September 2006, the Federal Court of Australia brought down a judgment determining that another judge should make the opinion deciding Noongar native title over the Perth metropolitan area in the case of Bennell v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1243.

The suburb was named after an early settler-colonialist, Robert Menli Lyon, who recorded and interacted with the local Aboriginal group in the area circa the nineteenth century. Before European contact, the suburb was occupied by the Beeliar group of the Whadjuk nation, who are part of the broader Noongar language region. The Noongar peoples have Dreaming stories related to the creation of the landforms in Beeliar and had lore that outlined the maintenance and care of the land. Oral history records and archaeology account for the Beeliar-Noongar belonging to the Beeliar suburb and its neighbouring areas. ", "Historically, \"Beeliar\" has referred to a variety of things. The settler-colonialist, Robert Menli Lyon, recorded the term \"Beeliar\" with a dual reference. In one context, he used the term \"Beeliar\" as a \"district\" for the region. The other use for the term was to refer to the local Aboriginal group's language. Older sources regarded the Beeliar region as the \"Yagan territory on the southside of the Swan River\", which is larger than the present boundaries of the suburb of Beeliar.", "A new era for the Swan River Colony emerged after Stirling resigned in 1838. During this new era, which lasted until 1860, an influx of British convicts and settlers moved to the region. The occupation of more people led to roads, infrastructure and housing being created. By extension, this led to the creation of new suburbs within the metropolitan region of Perth, such as Beeliar. Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal writer Robert Menli Lyon, one of the first settler-colonialists from Britain, recorded the region of Beeliar as \"the district of Midjegoorong\" in 1833. He outlined the boundaries of this area as being \"north-south from the Swan and Canning Rivers to Mangles Bay, and east-west from the sea to the Darling Scarp\". It was not until the following decade that this region came to have a permanent non-Indigenous occupation."]}, {"page": "1789 in Australia", "response": ["** Robert Menli Lyon, Aboriginal advocate (d. 1874)"]}, {"page": "Midgegooroo", "response": ["Midgegooroo (died 22 May 1833) was an Aboriginal Australian elder of the Nyungar nation, who played a key role in Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in the area of Perth, Western Australia.

Moore, Robert Menli Lyon and Francis Armstrong, derived their information from discussions with contemporary Noongar people, in particular the son of Midgegooroo, Yagan.  Largely due to his exploits in opposing colonisation and his relationship with Lyon and Moore, Yagan has a much sharper historical profile than his father. ", "Nothing is known of Midgegooroo's life prior to the arrival of white settlers in 1829. At that time, Midgegooroo was the leader of his home country, Beeliar, which stretched  from the Indian Ocean to the Canning River, south of the Swan River. Robert Menli Lyon reported that the northernmost land in Beeliar adjoined \"Melville Water and the Canning\",Perth Gazette, 23 March 1833; 13 April 1833  and was bordered \"by the mountains on the east; by the sea on the west; and by a line, due east, from Mangles Bay, on the south\". Midgegooroo's main camp (\"headquarters\") was a place known as \"Mendyarrup, situated somewhere in Gaudoo\", suggesting that it was in the vicinity of Blackwall Reach and Point Walter.Robert Menli Lyon may have acquired most of this information from Yagan rather than Midgegooroo. In 1832, Lyon had intervened on behalf of Yagan and two of his countrymen, Domera and Ningina who had been captured and awaited sentence for spearing a colonist William Gaze in June. Lyon persuaded Lieutenant-Governor Frederick Irwin to allow him to accompany the three prisoners to Carnac Island to \"acquire a knowledge of their language and prevent that frightful state of things in which the deliberate shedding of blood will involve the settlement\". For a month, Lyon and the three Aboriginal men were alone on the island, during which time they taught him about the language and society of the people of the Swan River region, including the names of places.Bevan Carter Nyungah Land, p. 33Perth Gazette 23 March 1833; 13 April 1833 However, Midgegooroo's family had some rights to use resources on a large part of what is now metropolitan Perth, and were able to move freely about an even larger area, presumably due to kinship ties with neighbours.

Despite the significance of Lyons work in being the first of its kind, George Fletcher Moore diary republished in 1884 described Lyons work as \"containing many inaccuracies and much that was fanciful\".  During August and October 1839 the Perth Gazette published Vocabulary of the Aboriginal people of Western Australia written by Lieutenant Grey of HM 83rd Regiment. Grey spent twelve months studying the languages of the Nyungar people and came to the conclusion that there was much in common between them, just prior to the publication he received from Mr Bussel of the Busselton district a list of 320 words from that region which was near identical to those he had collected in the Swan River region. The work of Grey much to his disappointment was published in an unfinished list as he was leaving the colony, but he believed that the publication would assist in communication between settlers and Nyungar people. Also noted by Grey was that the Nyungar language had no soft c sound, there was no use of f and that h was very rarely used and never at the start of a word."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Aboriginal history of Western Australia", "response": ["* October 1829 Aboriginal people stole sheep, poultry and goats, and plundered a house of provisions in the Swan district.
