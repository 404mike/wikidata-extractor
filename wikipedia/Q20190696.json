Matt Beca and Scott Pitt returned to Glasgow, while Matt Stanisz and Gerard Hanson followed them, and Paul Swindlehurst departed to join the Belfast Giants. One of the biggest losses came after netminder Mike Clemente retired after two seasons. Clemente was a fan favourite and proved to be one of the best goaltenders in the league. Matt Ginn did a stellar job coming into the squad to replace him, ending the year with a 90.9% save percentage, the fourth most among regular goaltenders across the league.", "| Paul Swindlehurst"]}, {"page": "2019 IIHF World Championship rosters", "response": ["| 23 || D || align=left|Paul Swindlehurst ||  ||  ||  || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Belfast Giants"]}, {"page": "2021 IIHF World Championship rosters", "response": ["| 23 || D || align=left|Paul Swindlehurst ||  ||  ||  || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Coventry Blaze"]}, {"page": "Swindlehurst, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Swindlehurst"]}]}}
