L. Storey, was an English historian specialising in late medieval English political and church history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Neville (died 1460)", "response": ["In 1457, Neville was appointed Chamberlain of the Exchequer, along with a co-heir of Ralph, Lord Cromwell. Later that year his father and brother appointed Thomas their deputy on the West March, where they were joint Wardens. For this he received a salary of 500 marks \u2013 which, R.L. Storey points out, was \"less than a quarter of their official salary\". A few months later, he stood as surety for his uncle William, Lord Fauconberg's good behaviour (whom Michael Hicks speculates may have been involved in piracy at this time). By 1459 the domestic political situation had descended into outright civil war; when the earl of Salisbury marched south from his castle at Middleham in September to join up with the duke of York at Ludlow, Thomas marched with him in a 5,000-strong army. On 23 September 1459, they encountered a larger royal force at Blore Heath, which Salisbury defeated, killing its leader, James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley. Thomas and John, though, were somehow captured near Tarporley, Cheshire, the next day. Hicks has suggested that this was due to their being wounded in battle and sent home; Rosemary Horrox on the other hand posits that they ventured too far from the main army in pursuit of fleeing Lancastrians. Attainted in the Parliament of Devils the next month, they were imprisoned in Chester Castle and not released until their brother Warwick was victorious at the Battle of Northampton in June 1460.  Thomas Neville was appointed, jointly with his father, to Keeper of the Royal Mews as part of the Nevilles' policy of filling the positions of political importance with their own sympathisers.; Hicks has called it \"decidedly a Neville dominated regime\". He was immediately, on his release, appointed to commissions to arrest and imprison any who disturbed the peace, and received grants of Duchy of Lancaster estates at the same time.  When the duke of York joined them and claimed the throne in October 1460, the Nevilles were as set against his claim as every other member of the nobility present for the coming parliament. Thomas Neville appears to have been fundamental to Salisbury's resistance to York's claims: possibly with Warwick, it was certainly Thomas who met York at Westminster Palace (where he had evicted the King from his lodgings), and informed the duke that his position was untenable \"to both lords and people\"; According to P.A. Johnson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Bourchier refused to confront the duke of York, so on two occasions \"Thomas Neville was sent instead\". Two days later, on 13 October 1460, he again went to York: \"whatever was then said is unknown, but Neville's mandate must have been both blunt and bluntly delivered\". York acquiesced to a compromise."]}]}}
