On 21 October, it played a key role in founding the Movement for the Rebirth of the Constitutional Monarchy. \u010cavo\u0161ki stated that the introduction of a constitutional monarchy in Serbia would mark a symbolic yet radical break with the past.

The alliance did not include the Democratic Party which was opposed to it both on organisational and ideological grounds, declaring that the nationalist orientation of the USDO was contrary to its civic ideology.
