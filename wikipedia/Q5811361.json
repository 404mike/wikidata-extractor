Nearly all those who produce graphics for mass publication are trained exclusively in the fine arts and have had little experience with the analysis of data. Such experiences are essential for achieving precision and grace in the presence of statistics... Those who get ahead are those who beautified data, never mind statistical integrity.\u201dFurther, in his second published book, Envisioning Information, Tufte critiques Holmes' Diamonds chart (image not added due to copyright):\u201cConsider this unsavory exhibit at right \u2013 chockablock with clich\u00e9 and stereotype, coarse humor, and a content-empty third dimension... Credibility vanishes in clouds of chartjunk; who would trust a chart that looks like a video game?\u201dIn a 1992 New York Times article, the reporter captures Holmes' response to Tufte's criticism:\u201cTime\u2019s Nigel Holmes, creator of the diamonds graph, was understandably irked when Tufte criticized it. Holmes admits his work has sometimes been exaggerated, but feels that Tufte, in his insistence on absolute mathematical fidelity, remains trapped in \u2019the world of academia\u2019 and insensitive to \u2019the world of commerce,\u2019 with its need to grab an audience\u201dThis debate between Tufte and Holmes is emblematic of the tension between statistical and designerly approaches to visualization design."]}]}}
