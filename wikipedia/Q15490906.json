Adams was hired by Doctor Who first but was then subsequently hired by BBC Radio as well. The Krikkitmen is believed to be the story he had spent the most time working on, before it was rejected by script editor Robert Holmes, who encouraged Adams to work on The Hitchhiker's Guide instead and continue submitting material for Doctor Who, although for Season 16; this ultimately led to his commission for The Pirate Planet. In 1980, Adams revised The Krikkitmen for use by Paramount Pictures as a potential Doctor Who feature film, although nothing came of this project.. Finally, Adams included many of the ideas from The Krikkitmen in his novel Life, the Universe and Everything, the second sequel to his book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
