The Stony, Iron and Stony-Iron classification I am referring to is the one used by Nevil Story Maskelyne. It has the great advantage that it is easy to understand even for people unfamiliar with meteorite classification. Another shortfall of the current template is that it equates Stony meteorites with Chondrites (primitive stony meteorites), which ignores the fact that there are differentiated stony meteorites (Eucrit, Howardite, Ureilite, SNC).  The Prior-Mason classification used in the \"Cambridge Encyclopedia of Meteorites\" is in many respects outdated. Modifications of the Prior-Mason classification were published by Weisberg 2006 (Chondrite, Primitive-Achondrite, Achondrite) and are in wide use. To sum it up I think that stony/iron/stony-iron and differentiated/primitive are a great way of making classification accessible to laymen and should be separate from chondrite/primitive-achondrite/achondrite.  Your absolutely right about Parent body being speculative. I also understand that it is obvious to some people that Martian meteorites are from Mars. But I rather like the explicit approach of an infoboxes.  Clan and Subgroups might also be to detailed. I don't know if you  would agree, but we could just put the fields in and see if anyone adds them to the infobox. If nobody does it, we can still get rid of them.  I would be happy to hear back from you! --Tobias1984 (talk) 10:29, 22 December 2012 (UTC)"]}, {"page": "Nevil", "response": ["*Nevil Story Maskelyne (1823\u20131911), English geologist and politician"]}, {"page": "Nevil Maskelyne (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Nevil Story Maskelyne (1823\u20131911), English geologist and politician"]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|Nevil Story Maskelyne"]}, {"page": "Mervyn Herbert Nevil Story-Maskelyne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nevil Story Maskelyne"]}, {"page": "List of Wadham College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Nevil Story Maskelyne, geologist and politician", "* Nevil Story Maskelyne, geologist and politician"]}, {"page": "List of Freemasons (E\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Nevil Story Maskelyne, British geologist.
