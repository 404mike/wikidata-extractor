However, he was to enjoy a regular place at Chester for most of his time with the club. This was despite the fact he was part-time in his later years at the club as he worked as a salesman.\nGill was awarded testimonial matches by Chester in 1956 and 1962 against representative teams. He later played for Hyde United, Altrincham and Winsford United.", "link_mentions": {}}}
