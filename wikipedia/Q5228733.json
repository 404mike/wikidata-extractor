He aspired to be a postman, and never believed that he would make a living playing football. He then worked as a binman, waiter and hod carrier and therefore entered the game relatively late. He played for Llandudno Town at age 15, before joining Northern Premier League side Bangor City on \u00a310 a week as a semi-professional the following year. Bangor manager Dave Elliott regularly selected veteran goalkeeper Peter Eales ahead of Southall. Everton asked Elliot permission to take Southall on trial, but Elliot left the club shortly after and no trial took place. With Bangor in financial trouble the paid playing staff began to leave the club, and Southall left Bangor and went on to accept an offer of \u00a33 a week to play for Conwy United. He moved on to Cheshire County League club Winsford United at the age of 20. The club won the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1980, and Southall was voted the club's Player of the Year."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Dave Elliott||||MF||1966\u20131971||90||4||"]}, {"page": "David Elliott", "response": ["David or Dave Elliott may refer to:", "*Dave Elliott (footballer, born 1945), English footballer and manager", "*Dave Elliott (footballer, born 1968), Scottish footballer", "*Dave Elliott (American football) (born 1952), American football coach and former player"]}]}}
