Queen's Island were voted out at the expense of Derry. Joe McCleery, a native of the city, was enticed from his managerial post in Dundalk with Dundalk F.C. to become Derry's first manager and he quickly signed Fred Mason from his former club. The big Birmingham-born player settled well in the team and city, eventually establishing Mason's bar in Magazine Street after his playing career ended. Plans to purchase a pitch fell through due to the tight timescales and so the Londonderry Corporation was approached for the use of the Brandywell Stadium which had been used for football up until the end of the 19th century. This began an association between the club and the ground which has survived until the present day. The club are still operating under the constraints of the Honourable the Irish Society charter limitations which declare that the Brandywell must be available for the recreation of the community. In effect, the club do not have private ownership over the ground and, thus, cannot develop it by their own accord with that discretion left to the Derry City Council (formerly the Londonderry Corporation)."]}, {"page": "Frederick Mason", "response": ["* Fred Mason (Frederick Oliver Mason, 1901\u2013?), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Cardiff's winning streak ended with a 2\u20132 draw with Burnley at Ninian Park on 2 April with both goals being scored by Keenor.
