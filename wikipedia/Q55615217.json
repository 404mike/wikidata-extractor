Ranger became interested in African history and developed views that were considered radical by the white government of the time, leading the Rhodesian authorities to restrict his movement to within a three-mile radius of his home. He was deported in 1963 and took up a lectureship at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania,Trevor Grundy, \"Professor Terence Ranger: Historian and activist whose vigorous campaign against white rule in Southern Rhodesia led to his deportation\", The Independent, 26 February 2015. where his colleagues included John Lonsdale, John Iliffe and John McCracken. During this time Ranger wrote Revolt in Southern Rhodesia, 1896\u201397: A Study in African Resistance (1967), which showed how Africans lived before the arrival of Cecil Rhodes and his Pioneer Column in 1890 and attempted to explain why the country's two main tribes, the Shona and Matabele, rose up against the European settlers, and The African Voice in Southern Rhodesia (1970), both of which were influential in the development of African nationalism."]}, {"page": "Chilembwe uprising", "response": ["Chilembwe's aims have also come under scrutiny. According to Robert I. Rotberg, Chilembwe's speech of 23 January appeared to stress the importance and inevitability of martyrdom as a principal motivation. The same speech depicted the uprising as a manifestation of desperation but because of his desire to \"strike a blow and die\", he did not have any idea of what he would replace colonialism with if the revolt succeeded. Rotberg concludes that Chilembwe planned to seize power in the Shire Highlands or perhaps in all of Nyasaland. John McCracken attacks the idea that the revolt could be considered nationalist, arguing that Chilembwe's ideology was instead fundamentally utopian and created in opposition to localised abuses of the colonial system, particularly thangata. According to McCracken, the uprising failed because Chilembwe was over-reliant on a small Europeanised petite bourgeoisie and did not gain enough mass support. Rotberg's examination the Chilembwe revolt from a psychoanalytical perspective concludes that Chilembwe's personal situation, his psychosomatic asthma and financial debt may have been contributory factors in his decision to plot the rebellion."]}, {"page": "John McCracken", "response": ["John McCracken may refer to:", "* John McCracken (artist) (1934\u20132011), American minimalist artist", "* John McCracken (historian) (1938\u20132017), Scottish historian and Africanist"]}, {"page": "List of University of Zimbabwe people", "response": ["* John McCracken, Scottish historian; taught at UZ 1964\u20131965, when he left following Rhodesia's UDI"]}]}}
