This species first appeared in the scientific literature as Rhagodia hastata in 1810 in  the Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae, authored by the prolific Scottish botanist, Robert Brown. In 1978, Andrew John Scott made the combination Einadia hastata. After phylogenetical research, Fuentes-Bazan et al. (2012) included this species in genus Chenopodium, as Chenopodium hastatum (R.Br.) S. Fuentes & Borsch., but this name was a later homonym and thus illegitimate. In 2017, Iamonico & Mosyakin replaced it by the name Chenopodium robertianum, honouring the botanist Robert Brown."]}, {"page": "A.J.Scott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew John Scott (botanist)"]}]}}
