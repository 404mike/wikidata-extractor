They were immediately confronted with extreme conditions including 100 mph winds and freezing temperatures. Deep crevasses slowed the advance, and when the men attempted to set up camp and wait out the storm, their tents were swept away by the wind. Finally, after 15 hours on the glacier, Captain Hamilton requested evacuation, with the message \"Unable to move. Environmental casualties imminent.\" Three Wessex helicopters were dispatched from the Task Force: two Wessex Mk5s from Tidespring and one Mk3 from Antrim. After one failed attempt, they managed to locate and embark the stranded SAS men, but in whiteout conditions, one pilot became disorientated and his aircraft crashed. The passengers were loaded onto the two remaining helicopters, but soon afterwards one of these hit a ridge and crashed, though once again without any serious casualties. The last Wessex, Antrim\u2032s Mk3, after having offloaded its troops on board the destroyer returned to the glacier and after two failed attempts managed to retrieve the downed SAS and aircrew, though their equipment had to be abandoned. The pilot, Lieutenant commander Ian Stanley, managed to nurse his overloaded aircraft back to Antrim and make an emergency landing on her flight deck, for which he was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order."]}, {"page": "Gavin Hamilton", "response": ["Gavin Hamilton may refer to:", "* Gavin Hamilton (archbishop of St Andrews) (died 1571), archbishop of St Andrews", "* Gavin Hamilton (bishop of Galloway) (1561\u20131612), bishop of Galloway", "* Gavin Hamilton (artist) (1723\u20131798), Scottish artist", "* Gavin Hamilton (lawyer) (1751\u20131805), Friend of Robert Burns", "* Gavin Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell (1872\u20131952), British politician", "* Gavin Hamilton (British Army officer) (1953\u20131982), SAS officer killed in Falklands War", "* Gavin Hamilton (cricketer) (born 1974), Scottish cricketer"]}, {"page": "Armed Forces Memorial", "response": ["*Gavin Hamilton (1953\u20131982), highest ranking SAS soldier killed in the Falklands War"]}, {"page": "Royal Masonic School for Boys", "response": ["* Gavin Hamilton (British Army officer) \u2013 Military Cross (Posthumously Awarded)"]}, {"page": "Skirmish at Many Branch Point", "response": ["On 10 June 1982, in the closing days of the Falklands War, Many Branch Point, a ridge near Port Howard in West Falkland, was the site of a minor skirmish between the Argentine and British Armed Forces.
