Despite Allaun's life work, Britain remained a nuclear power.\nFrank Allaun retired from the House of Commons in 1983 but continued to be active in politics. This included writing the books Spreading the News: A Guide To Media Reform (1989) and The Struggle for Peace (1992).\nHis recreations were walking and swimming.\nHis first wife died in 1986, and on 3 June 1989 he married Millie Bobker, n\u00e9e Greenberg, a widow and retired civil servant.\nHe died in Manchester in 2002 aged 89.
