He helped to organise the first Aldermaston March in 1958 and was chair of the Labour Peace Fellowship. Allaun was against British membership of the EEC.Allaun contested Manchester Moss Side in 1951. He was Member of Parliament for Salford East from 1955 to 1983.\nHe was a veteran of leftwing causes, especially the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), of which he was vice president from 1983. He was the first President of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy in 1973. Allaun wrote several books on nuclear weapons including Stop the H-Bomb Race (1959) and The Wasted 30 Billions (1975).\nIn his book \u2018\u2019Next Stop Execution\u2019\u2019, Oleg Gordievsky stated that\u2019s Allaun\u2019s work with the peace movement and elsewhere was viewed favourably within the Soviet Union.\nNaive or optimistic, or just unappreciative of war culture, Allaun was a straight up-and-down idealist. His style was intensely gentle, the voice never raised, but the questions - chiefly on peace and housing - insistent. The beautiful manners and the soft Lancashire voice must have got on ministerial nerves. But then, as one of the organisers of the first Aldermaston march, he helped launch a movement whose appeal in the late 1950s and 1960s did more than get on nerves.\nOutside the peace movement, his preoccupation was with public housing, and the vastly increased expenditure he urged should be paid for by cuts, equally massive, in defence. Defence cuts would, of course, come, but, despite Allaun's life work, Britain remained a nuclear power.\nFrank Allaun retired from the House of Commons in 1983 but continued to be active in politics. This included writing the books Spreading the News: A Guide To Media Reform (1989) and The Struggle for Peace (1992).\nHis recreations were walking and swimming.\nHis first wife died in 1986, and on 3 June 1989 he married Millie Bobker, n\u00e9e Greenberg, a widow and retired civil servant.\nHe died in Manchester in 2002 aged 89. His second wife, son and daughter survived him.", "link_mentions": {}}}
