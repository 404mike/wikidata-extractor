It was passed in 1792 to the merchant's great nephew Mark Pringle.  In 1794, Mark began construction of a new classical-style house, adjacent to the older house on the north shore of the loch. This new building has been attributed to Kelso-based architect and builder William Elliot. Mark died in 1812 and around 1820, his son John Pringle, who had inherited, remodelled the new house with an Ionic portico and loggia, to designs by architect Archibald Elliot. Further extensions were planned to replace the old house, but these were never carried out. Marble statues were installed on the garden terrace at this time, and several estate buildings including the stables were erected. Capt. John Pringle kept a menagerie on the estate, including a bear, wolf and monkey, whose cages still stand.
