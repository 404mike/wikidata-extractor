She also competed in the mixed doubles event with Gordon Lowe but they were eliminated in the first round. In 1919 she won the singles title at the World Covered Court Championship, played on wooden courts at the Sporting Club de Paris, defeating Germaine Regnier Golding in the final in straight sets. She also won the World Hard Court Championship in 1920 defeating Francisca Subirana in straight sets. Holman won the British Covered Court Championships, played at the Queen's Club in London, on four occasions (1912, 1914, 1921 and 1922).\nHer best result at the Wimbledon Championships came in 1912 and 1913 when she reached the semifinal of the singles event, which she lost to Charlotte Copper Sterry and Winifred Slocock McNair respectively.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tennis at the 1920 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| Winifred BeamishDorothy Holman"]}, {"page": "Suzanne Lenglen", "response": ["Lenglen's next event was Wimbledon.

She won the triple crown, taking the doubles with Ryan and the mixed doubles with Australian Gerald Patterson. The doubles final was also a rematch of the previous year's final against Lambert Chambers and Larcombe, while the mixed doubles victory came against defending champions Ryan and Lycett. Lenglen's decision to partner with Patterson led to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Lawn Tennis (FFLT) threatening to not pay her expenses for the Wimbledon trip unless she partnered with a compatriot. Lenglen and her father replied by paying for the trip themselves. After Wimbledon, Lenglen won both of her events in Belgium in the lead-up to the Olympic Games in Antwerp. At the Olympics, Lenglen won two gold medals and one bronze medal for France. She won the singles title over British player Dorothy Holman, losing only four games in the entire event. She won mixed doubles with Decugis, overcoming an opening set loss in their quarterfinal. Lenglen partnered with d'Ayen again in the doubles event, losing their semifinal to Kathleen McKane and Winifred McNair in a tight match that ended 8\u20136 in the decisive third set.
