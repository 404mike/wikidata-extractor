In 1931 she married fellow communist and International Brigadeer, Clive Branson, and in 1934 she carried out a mission for Harry Pollitt to smuggle funding to Indian communists resisting the British colonial occupation of India. Noreen Branson was most known for her work as a historian, working as a researcher for the Labour Research Department, collaborating with historians Eric Hobsbawm and Roger Simon, and writing the 3rd and 4th volumes of the CPGB's official history.", "Noreen Branson joined The Bach Choir in 1929, and in 1931 at the age of 20 took part in a Charity Concert at the Scarlet Theatre in east London. During this event she met the painter and poet Clive Branson, and agreed to marry him within days of first meeting him. Noreen Branson married Clive Branson in June 1931, and two years later the couple had their only child, the future artist Rosa Branson. Noreen was at this point in her life not very interested in politics, however her husband Clive held strong socialist beliefs and was a supporter of the Soviet Union and Marxism\u2013Leninism. The couple began having more frequent discussions on politics and often lent each other books.", "Wishing to become more politically active and feeling betrayed by Ramsay MacDonald's \"defection\", both Noreen and Clive Branson joined the Independent Labour Party in Chelsea in Autumn 1931. The couple began campaigning in the poorest parts of the borough and began distributing a newspaper titled Revolt which they along with a small group of associates produced. While conducting political work in run-down housing blocks, she became more aware of the poverty which existed under British capitalism, and came face-to-face with issues such as unemployment. These experiences convinced her that capitalism was a failed system, and both she and her husband joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in July 1932 and turned Revolt into a communist party newspaper. Soon after joining the CPGB, Noreen and her husband moved to Battersea where they became icons of the working class community and Noreen became the secretary of the local CPGB branch in 1936.", "In 1935 she attended the 7th World Congress of the Communist International in Moscow and spent several months as a comintern messenger to underground parties in Europe without being caught. Her aristocratic upbringing allowed her to move throughout Europe without arousing suspicion. Noreen Branson and Clive Branson dedicated much of their time to opposing fascism, opposing Oswald Mosley and his supporters, but also rallying opposition to Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. Noreen then joined the North Battersea Co-operative Women's Guild and represented the organisation on the Aid Spain Committee, established in 1936 by the Battersea Trades Council. In early 1938 Noreen's husband Clive joined the International Brigades to fight against Nazi backed nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War, however he was captured on the 3rd of April and was kept prisoner for 8 months. Noreen sent Clive and fellow republican prisoners funding to buy cigarettes, as a way of letting the prisoners know that they had not been forgotten. While Clive was being held as a POW, Noreen began working as a researcher for Harry Poillitt and then for the Labour Research Department where she specialised in welfare and social services. She published her first article in the Labour Research Department magazine in September 1938 and continued to routinely contribute to the magazine for another 65 years. She also edited the magazine for 25 years.", "Come the beginning of the World War II, Noreen Branson signed up to become an air raid warden. Inspired by her work as an air raid warden, her husband Clive included Noreen's likeness in his painting Bombed Women and Searchlights (1940) which is currently held by the Tate art museum in London. Noreen's home city of Battersea soon became a key target for German V1 and V2 rockets due to the presence of its close network of railway tracks and power station. While Clive was away on military duty, his and Noreen's home was bombed by the Germans, after which Noreen moved to Hampstead. In 1944, Noreen's husband Clive Branson was killed in Burma by the Japanese when he was hit by an anti-tank shell near Point 315 at the end of the Battle of the Admin Box."]}, {"page": "25th Dragoons", "response": ["The 25th Dragoons was the home of British communist, painter, and former International Brigadeer Clive Branson, who was killed by the Japanese at the Battle of the Admin Box."]}, {"page": "Branson (surname)", "response": ["* Clive Branson (1907\u201344), British artist and poet"]}, {"page": "Rosa Branson", "response": ["Rosa Branson  (born 1933) is a British painter and fabric designer, living in Highgate, London.
