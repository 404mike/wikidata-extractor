In those regions, the fungus is reportedly eaten following prolonged boiling that may neutralise the toxins, though this has never been proven scientifically. Similar reports exist from the San Francisco Bay Area of the United States, but probably involve a different fungus misidentified as R. satanas. Ramsbottom speculated that there may be a regional variation in its toxicity, and conceded that the fungus may not be as poisonous as widely reported. Nevertheless, R. satanas is rarely sampled casually, not least because of the putrid smell of its mature fruiting bodies, which in addition to their bright colours and blue staining, make the fungus unappealing for human consumption."]}, {"page": "Tricholoma sulphureum", "response": ["It has a convex cap with a vague umbo up to  across, sulphur yellow in colour. The thick, sinuate gills, stipe and flesh are similarly bright yellow. The smell, caused by the chemical skatole, is enough to distinguish it from other yellow fungi.

His initial papers, co-authored by E. M. Wakefield, were on British corticioid fungi and heterobasidiomycetes, but he subsequently developed an expertise in the taxonomy of agarics, publishing a series of papers on this group of fungi from 1919 to 1952. In 1948 he produced a checklist of British species, co-authored with Dr R. W. G. Dennis of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Pearson spoke several European languages, collected fungi in Spain and Portugal (on which he wrote brief papers), was an active member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mycologique de France, and was credited with introducing new, continental ideas on modern agaric taxonomy into Britain. In 1948 he was invited to survey fungi in South Africa, publishing a number of new species as a result.

Orton."]}, {"page": "Fungal Biology", "response": ["The journal was established in 1896 under the title Transactions of the British Mycological Society.

Knapp described  the species and illustrated it in a woodcut. He wrote: We have even an agaric, with a bulbous root and downy pileus, that will spring from the smooth summit of another (agaricus caseus), which has a uniform footstalk, though not of common occurrence. Thus a plant, that itself arises from decay, is found to constitute a soil for another; and the termination of this chain of efficiency is hidden from us. Seven years later, Miles Berkeley described the fungus as Agaricus loveianus, not aware of Knapp's previous publication, and wrote that it was \"a most elegant and curious species which ... appears not to have been hitherto noticed.\" Berkeley's name was frequently used in literature to refer to the fungus for over a century rather than Knapp. In his 1917 North American Flora, William Alphonso Murrill proposed a new name combination for the species based on Berkeley's name, Volvariopsis loweiana. In 1942, John Ramsbottom discovered Knapp's image and description of the fungus, and realizing it referred to the same species as Berkeley's Agaricus loveianus, made the new combination Volvaria surrecta. Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Volvariella in 1951, giving it the name by which it is known presently."]}, {"page": "Quekett Microscopical Club", "response": ["Several eminent scientists have been presidents of the Club, including Edwin Lankester (1865\u201366), Peter le Neve Foster (1869), Lionel Smith Beale (1870\u201371), Robert Braithwaite (bryologist) (1872\u20131873), Henry Lee (1875\u201377), Thomas Henry Huxley (1877\u201379), Thomas Spencer Cobbold (1879\u201380), Mordecai Cubitt Cooke (1881\u201383), William Benjamin Carpenter (1883\u201385), William Dallinger (1889\u201392), George Edward Massee (1899-1903), Edward Alfred Minchin (1908-1912) Arthur Dendy (1912\u201316), Alfred Barton Rendle (1916\u201321), Sir David Prain (1924\u201326), William Thomas Calman (1926\u201328), John Ramsbottom (1928\u201331) and Hamilton Hartridge (1951\u201354)."]}, {"page": "Ramsb.", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Ramsbottom (mycologist)"]}, {"page": "Ramsbottom (surname)", "response": ["*John Ramsbottom (engineer) (1814\u20131897), English mechanical engineer", "*John Ramsbottom (MP) (1778\u20131845), British Whig politician and landowner", "*John Ramsbottom (mycologist) OBE FLS (1885\u20131974), British mycologist"]}, {"page": "Human interactions with fungi", "response": ["Some species such as the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain.
