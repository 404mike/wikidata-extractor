Appointed a Tutor at Christ Church, Oxford in 1883 he was later Principal of the Leeds Clergy School and afterwards Vicar of Holy Trinity in the same city. He was vicar of St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston from 1903 to 1912 and was named Archdeacon of Birmingham in 1904.  In 1908 he turned down the post of Archbishop of Cape Town before accepting the Truro See in 1912. Burrows had planned a trip to Canada when the Great War began in August, 1914. He supported British participation in the War, and his monthly published diocesan magazines are filled with examples of clergy, clergy families and church organisations committed to the War effort. For example, a Clerical Roll of Honour listed clergy and their sons 'serving their country', including, in May, 1915, 62 named by vicarage with one case of 6 of the same family. In 1917, a list of daughters serving as nurses, teachers, cooks and munition workers was published. Deaths of clergy and their sons and bravery awards featured prominently. But Burrows did not favour clergy serving as combatants. He said, \"The impulse is good but it must be restrained. Whilst the 'general instinct is right' ... it would be shocking to us to realise that the hands that baptise our infants or break bread in the Sacrament, have just been working a machine gun or launching lethal gas on the fire\" Of course,many future clergy not ordained until after the War had had such experiences.\nIn 1919, Burrows was translated from Truro to Chichester where he served for ten years until his sudden death in Lambeth Palace. In a strange twist of fate, William Champion Streatfeild, Burrows' Suffragan at the time of Burrows' death, died three days after Burrows' passing.Burrow's cousin, Leonard, was appointed Bishop of Sheffield in 1914.\nBurrows was a High Churchman, and while Bishop of Truro, he emphasised the importance of the services of the Book of Common Prayer; a book of services for special occasions which he compiled and authorised was entirely based on the contents of the prayer book and on Scripture.", "link_mentions": {}}}
