He was a right-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler who played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire between 1981 and 1985.\nFell first represented Nottinghamshire in the 1979 Second XI Championship, playing in this and the Warwickshire Under-25 Competition for the next two years. Fell also played in the Benson and Hedges Cup campaigns of 1982, (for Nottinghamshire), 1986, and 1996 (for the Minor Counties), interspersing a three-and-a-half month stint with Derbyshire in the meantime. Fell has intermittently played for Lincolnshire in Minor Counties cricket from 1986 to the present day, having most recently turned out for the 2006 Championship. He has played in the MCC Trophy for Lincolnshire since 1993.\nFell has chopped and changed his position in the batting lineup several times, being an upper-order batsman during his earlier days for the Second XI, maintaining a lower-order stream in the County Championship.\nIn 1987, he and his Bassetlaw and District Cricket League team-mates reached the final of the LCC President's Trophy, losing to Durham County League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Chapman (cricketer)", "response": ["Despite his improved statistics in 1998, the following year  Chapman found himself confined to the second team all season having been plagued with a persistent elbow injury.

Here he found rather more success, taking 4\u201318 against Berkshire in the first round of the 2002 C&G Trophy (actually played, due to the vagaries of the fixture list, in August 2001), and making his first ever List A half-century in the same competition in 2003 when he hit an unbeaten 53 in a defeat against Nottinghamshire."]}, {"page": "Parkgate Cricket Ground", "response": ["* Best bowling in an innings: 4/10 by Mark Fell, as above"]}, {"page": "Fell (surname)", "response": ["*Mark Fell (born 1960), former English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Fell, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Fell"]}, {"page": "List of Lincolnshire County Cricket Club List A players", "response": ["*Mark Fell (1988\u20132003): MA Fell"]}]}}
