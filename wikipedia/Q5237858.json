He also taught in Argentina, at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica, and at Curtin University in Western Australia.He was the author of two books \u2013 Partings Welded Together: Politics and Desire in the Nineteenth-Century English Novel (Methuen, 1987), and Social Transformations in Hardy\u2019s Tragic Novels: Megamachines and Phantasms (Palgrave Macmillan, 2003). Both books were widely reviewed, with the latter described by Tim Armstrong as \u201c...a theoretically provocative and fascinating study.\u201d (The Modern Language Review) and by Andrew Radford as \"...not only accessible to Hardy enthusiasts, but necessary to academic specialists\".He initiated the Essex Sociology of Literature Project at the University of Essex in 1976. This involved a set of conferences that according to literary critic, Terry Eagleton \"...have a quasi-mythological status in the minds of some who weren\u2019t even born at the time\".His main research areas were the English novel, Latin American literature, and the Enlightenment, and he published numerous articles in these fields.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of University of Essex people", "response": ["* David Musselwhite - Senior Lecturer, English Literature (1974\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "Musselwhite", "response": ["*David Musselwhite (1940\u20132010), British literary critic"]}, {"page": "Mary Channing", "response": ["Thomas Hardy was somewhat \"fascinated\" by and \"obsessed\" of Channing's execution. Critic David Musselwhite points out that Nance Mockridge, Mother Cuxsom and Mrs. Goodenogh, three character's in Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, were an \"avatar or surrogate of Channing. The Ring at Casterbridge mentioned in the novel was actually in Maumbury. In his article published in The Times (1908), Hardy noted the lack of evidences in proving that Channing poisoned her husband. Two of Hardy's poems The Mock Wife and The Bridge-Night Fire make references to her. David James' play White Mercury, Brown Rice (1995) enacted the trial of Channing."]}, {"page": "Musselwhite, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Musselwhite"]}]}}
