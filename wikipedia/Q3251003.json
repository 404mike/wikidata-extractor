But the ford of Rhyd-y-castell was actually located on the small lane called Cock and Hen Street, that runs alongside the Welsh Black (formerly the Black Lion) and leads towards Clarach and Llangorwen, and not on the main Aberystwyth to Machynlleth road where the first houses in Bow Street were built.Lewis, T., [Map of Gogerddan Estate, North Cardiganshire], August 1790 (NLW Gogerddan Map 232).  Though there is no officially sanctioned Welsh equivalent to Bow Street, the author and novelist Tom Macdonald, who spent part of his childhood here, recounted that \"old folk told me it was once called Nant-y-Fallen\".Macdonald, Tom, Western Mail, 13 September 1975. The small stream still called Nant Afallen runs under the main road a little to the north of where the original hamlet of Bow Street first grew up, and was applied to the row of small cottages that once stood nearby.  The name Nantyfallen was also later extended to refer to those cottages running up the slope from the brook towards Cross Street. Occasionally in Welsh writing the name Bow Street is spelt as Bwstryd.Macdonald, Tom (Translated by Morgan, Haydn), Y Tincer Tlawd (Cymdeithas Lyfrau Ceredigion, 1971), p.7.; Jones, Vernon, \u2018Newid ddaeth \u2026\u2019, Y Tincer, Rhif 257, Mawrth 2003, p. 11.", "*Tom Macdonald (1900\u20131980), journalist and novelist"]}, {"page": "Pen-y-garn, Ceredigion", "response": ["*Tom Macdonald (1900\u20131980), journalist and novelist, who lived the a cottage now called 'Llys Aeron'"]}, {"page": "Tom MacDonald (author)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Macdonald (writer)"]}, {"page": "Dewi Morgan", "response": ["He encouraged many young poets and writers, particularly the young Tom Macdonald who lived across the road from Dewi in Pen-y-garn.
