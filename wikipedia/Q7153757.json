By applying themselves to the cause, along with a number of additions to the side, including the signings of Paul Stancliffe and Glenn Cockerill from Lincoln City, the 1983\u201384 season saw the Blades cruise into the top 3 \u2013 which they would not drop out of all season. They were challenged for the promotion spots by Hull City, who by their final match were 3 goals behind them and 3 points behind. Hull's final match of that season was on a weekday at Burnley, and the Tigers went into the game knowing that 3 goals would be enough. Many United fans travelled to Turf Moor for the game, and were biting their nails when Hull cruised into a 2-goal lead, but try as they may, City could not find a third and United were up again to Division 2 \u2013 their second promotion in 3 seasons. Keith Edwards was top goalscorer again this season."]}]}}
