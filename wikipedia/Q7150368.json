Through their shared love of David Bowie and 1980s new wave bands including Duran Duran and ABC they started socialising together at weekends, going to gigs in Liverpool and playing along to drum loops together in their bedrooms with the desire of forming a band together.Reid, Pat, Burning Ambition - Mansun's Stove, web.archive.org. Retrieved August 2011 Whilst King was a relative newcomer to playing bass, Draper had previously formed and fronted the electronic duo Grind whilst studying at Thames Polytechnic (now University of Greenwich), with programmer-keyboard player Steve Heaton, and were often accompanied live by school friend Carlton Hibbert on drums. Grind released one 12\" single in 1991 on the small \"Whats in It For Me Records\" label and gigged around London at venues such as The Rock Garden and The Brain and also supported Beverley Craven at the Mean Fiddler. Following the split of Grind, Draper, funded by a grant from The Prince's Trust, set up a music company called \"Ambiance Productions\" producing relaxation tapes to be sold in \"hippie shops\" across the north west of England. In early 1995 Draper and King enlisted Maidstone expat Dominic Chad, who was the bar manager at the Fat Cat pub on Watergate Street in Chester opposite the office where Draper would go and see former Grind member Steve Heaton. Chad had previously played with \"Floating Bear\" formed whilst at Bangor University in 1990, where he had been studying French and Russian but was kicked off the course due to lack of effort. Chad would later admit that his routine during university was \"get up at three, go down to the union bar at four and stay there until it shut\". With the aid of a drum machine, the trio began rehearsing at Crash Rehearsal Studios in Liverpool, where the band were quickly discovered by passing A&R scouts Mark Lewis and Alan Wills (who later went on to form Deltasonic Records) who were there to see Cast and overheard the band through their rehearsal room door. The band were offered a publishing contract with Polygram Music Publishing four days after reluctantly handing over a demo tape of 4 songs that cost \u00a3150 to record featuring \"Take It Easy Chicken\", \"Skin Up Pin Up\", \"Moronica\" and \"She Makes My Nose Bleed\".", "*Paul Draper \u2013 lead vocals, guitars, keyboards (1995\u20132003)"]}, {"page": "Steve Hewitt", "response": ["In 2010, Hewitt joined songwriter/producer Brandun Reed as a collaborator on Reed's Polaroid Kiss project and played on the albums The New Coliseum (2013) and Youth (2015).
