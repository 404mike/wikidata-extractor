The current house was largely created between 1789\u20131793 by Colonel John Montresor of the Royal Engineers. His career was cut short when he was accused of embezzlement and the house was bought at auction in 1801 by General George Harris, for \u00a39,000. His descendants continued to live at Belmont, the clock collection being assembled by the 5th Lord Harris, who served as the first President of the Antiquarian Horological Society, for which Jonathan Betts acts as Curatorial Adviser.

Rogers argues Thacker was an invention of John Arbuthnot, and that The Longitudes Examined fell within the major tradition for satire, and that it was designed to send-up ambitious longitude projects. This view met with opposition from Jonathan Betts and Andrew King, both noted Harrisonians, who argued that, as Rogers acknowledged, there were in fact \"convincing reasons for accepting the traditional view that some good science is dropped into the project\"."]}, {"page": "2012 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Jonathan Betts, Senior Curator of Horology, National Maritime Museum.
