This was revised when the film studio, AIP, insisted that the name Vulnavia be retained.  North had since become pregnant and was therefore unable to reprise her role, which prompted the casting of Kemp as a replacement.Bruce G Hallenbeck, Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008, p 96.
