She spent the latter part of her childhood and youth in the United States and eventually became an American citizen, although she lived in France for many years and eventually retired to Scotland, where she died.Described as \"the Sarah Bernhardt of opera\", Garden was an exceptional actress as well as a talented singer. She was particularly admired for her nuanced performances which employed interesting uses of vocal color. Possessing a beautiful lyric voice that had a wide vocal range and considerable amount of flexibility, Garden first arose to success in Paris during the first decade of the 20th century. She became the leading soprano at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique; notably portraying roles in several world premieres, including M\u00e9lisande in Claude Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (1902). She worked closely with Jules Massenet, in whose operas she excelled. Massenet notably wrote the title role in his opera Ch\u00e9rubin (1905) for her.In 1907, Oscar Hammerstein convinced Garden to join the Manhattan Opera House in New York where she became an immediate success. By 1910 she was a household name in America and Garden appeared in operas in several major American cities; including performing with the Boston Opera Company and the Philadelphia Opera Company. Between 1910 and 1932 Garden worked in several opera houses in Chicago. She first worked with the Chicago Grand Opera Company (1910\u20131913) and then joined the Chicago Opera Association in 1915, ultimately becoming the company's director in 1921. Although director for only one year, Garden was notably responsible for staging the world premiere of Sergei Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges before the company went bankrupt in 1922. Shortly thereafter she became the director of the Chicago Civic Opera where she commissioned the opera Camille by 28-year-old composer Hamilton Forrest. She sang roles at the Civic Opera until 1931, notably in several United States and world premieres.\nAdditionally, Garden appeared in two silent films made by Samuel Goldwyn.After retiring from the opera stage in 1934, Garden worked as a talent scout for MGM. She also gave lectures and recitals, mostly on the life and works of Claude Debussy, until 1949. She retired to Scotland and in 1951 published a successful autobiography, Mary Garden's Story.\nHer voice is preserved on a number of recordings made for the Gramophone Company (including some with Debussy at the piano), Edison Records, Path\u00e9, Columbia Records and the Victor Talking Machine Company between 1903 and 1929.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Citizen Kane", "response": ["For Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles suggested that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a Mary Garden vehicle, an aria from Salammb\u00f4. \"Our problem was to create something that would give the audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but small voice, is suddenly thrown,\" Herrmann said. Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera, Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander. Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore. Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on Jean Racine's Athalie and Phedre, although some confusion remains since Lucille Fletcher remembered preparing the lyrics. Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera Wuthering Heights."]}, {"page": "Claude Debussy", "response": ["In January 1902 rehearsals began at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique for the opening of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande.

Maeterlinck wanted his mistress, Georgette Leblanc, to sing the role, and was incensed when she was passed over in favour of the Scottish soprano Mary Garden.Schonberg, Harold C. \"Maeterlinck's Mistress Assumed She Was Going to Sing Melisande.

She outlived her father by scarcely a year, succumbing to the diphtheria epidemic of 1919. Mary Garden said, \"I honestly don't know if Debussy ever loved anybody really. He loved his music \u2013 and perhaps himself.

He composed the work from 1909 to 1910, and it premiered in Philadelphia on February 25, 1911, with soprano Mary Garden in the title role and the young Irish tenor John McCormack in his American operatic debut. Herbert's score was well received, and the opera was repeated as part of the company's repertory during the next three seasons. It also enjoyed performances in New York City, making its debut there on February 28, 1911. Herbert's other opera, Madeleine, was a much lighter work in one act. On January 24, 1914, it had its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, but it was not revived beyond that season.Waters, p. 399", "Although his success had been in light music, like Sullivan, Herbert aspired to compose serious operas.

Joseph Redding's libretto for Natoma, set in 1820s California, is a love story between an American naval officer and a Native American princess. The cast included such distinguished singers as John McCormack and Mary Garden, but the 1911 premiere in Philadelphia was only a moderate success. Critics praised the music, including its effective melodies and leitmotifs set off by orchestral counterpoint.

The French libretto was adapted from Maurice Maeterlinck's symbolist play of the same name. It premiered at the Salle Favart in Paris by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on 30 April 1902; Jean P\u00e9rier was Pell\u00e9as and Mary Garden was M\u00e9lisande, conducted by Andr\u00e9 Messager, who was instrumental in getting the Op\u00e9ra-Comique to stage the work. The only opera Debussy ever completed, it is considered a landmark in 20th-century music.", "Carr\u00e9 was keen on a new Scottish singer, Mary Garden, who had captivated the Parisian public when she had taken over the lead role in Gustave Charpentier's Louise shortly after its premiere in 1900. Debussy was reluctant at first but he later recalled how impressed he was when he heard her sing: \"That was the gentle voice that I had heard in my inmost being, with its hesitantly tender and captivating charm, such that I had barely dared to hope for.\"", "Rehearsals for Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande began on 13 January 1902 and lasted for 15 weeks. Debussy was present for most of them. M\u00e9lisande was not the only role which caused casting problems: the child (Blondin) who was to play Yniold was not chosen until very later in the day and proved incapable of singing the part competently. Yniold's main scene (act 4 scene 3) was cut and only reinstated in later performances, when the role was given to a woman. In the course of rehearsals it was discovered that the stage machinery of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was unable to cope with the scene changes and Debussy had rapidly to compose orchestral interludes to cover them, music which (according to Orledge) \"proved the most expansive and obviously Wagnerian in the opera.\" Many of the orchestra and cast were hostile to Debussy's innovative work and, in the words of Roger Nichols, \"may not have taken altogether kindly to the composer's injunction, reported by Mary Garden, to 'forget, please, that you are singers'.\" The dress rehearsal took place on the afternoon of Monday, 28 April and was a rowdy affair. Someone\u2014in Mary Garden's view, Maeterlinck\u2014distributed a salacious parody of the libretto. The audience also laughed at Yniold's repetition of the phrase \"petit p\u00e8re\" (little father) and at Garden's Scottish accent: it appears she pronounced courage as curages, meaning \"the dirt that gets stuck in drains\". The censor, Henri Roujon, asked Debussy to make a number of cuts before the premiere, including Yniold's reference to Pell\u00e9as and M\u00e9lisande being \"near the bed\". Debussy agreed but kept the libretto unaltered in the published score.", "Critical reaction was mixed. Some accused the music of being \"sickly and practically lifeless\" and of sounding \"like the noise of a squeaky door or a piece of furniture being moved about, or a child crying in the distance.\" Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, a relentless opponent of Debussy's music, claimed he had abandoned his customary summer holidays so he could stay in Paris and \"say nasty things about Pell\u00e9as.\" But others \u2014 especially the younger generation of composers, students and aesthetes \u2014 were highly enthusiastic. Debussy's friend Paul Dukas lauded the opera, Romain Rolland described it as \"one of the three or four outstanding achievements in French musical history\", and Vincent d'Indy wrote an extensive review which compared the work to Wagner and early-17th-century Italian opera. D'Indy found Pell\u00e9as moving, too: \"The composer has in fact simply felt and expressed the human feelings and human sufferings in human terms, despite the outward appearance the characters present of living in a dream.\" The opera won a \"cult following\" among young aesthetes, and the writer Jean Lorrain satirised the Pell\u00e9astres who aped the costumes and hairstyles of Mary Garden and the rest of the cast.", "The initial run lasted for 14 performances, making a profit for the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. It became a staple part in the repertory of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25\u00a0January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took over the role of M\u00e9lisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: \"Une autre anglaise\u2014Mon Dieu\" (Another Englishwoman\u2014my God).

After a few small parts, she was cast as M\u00e9lisande in Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande by Debussy, replacing the originator of the role, Mary Garden. To prepare for Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, she studied with Debussy himself, and she is the only singer ever to be accompanied by Debussy on the piano with an orchestra in public (see Beau Soir). In 1910, Sir Thomas Beecham cast Teyte as Cherubino and M\u00e9lisande and also as Blonde in Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail for his London season. Despite her early singing successes, Teyte did not easily establish herself in the main opera houses. Instead, she moved to America and performed with the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1911\u20131914 and the Boston Opera Company from 1914\u201317, singing in Philadelphia and elsewhere, but not in New York, though she created the title role in Henry Kimball Hadley's opera, Bianca, at Manhattan's Park Theater in 1918.

Essentially Raisa was the company's dramatic soprano, Mary Garden the French-repertory soprano, Galli-Curci the light coloratura, Edith Mason a lyric, and Claudia Muzio a spinto soprano. Of all these, Claudia Muzio was the only one to share some roles with Raisa (Leonora in Il trovatore, Desdemona in Otello, Aida, Santuzza, and Tosca). Raisa was the company's only Maliella in Wolf-Ferrari's I gioielli della Madonna (Jewels of the Madonna), Gioconda, Amelia in Un ballo in maschera (always billed as Masked Ball in Chicago), Rachel in La Juive (always announced as The Jewess in Chicago), and of course the Mount Olympus in opera for sopranos, Norma in Bellini's opera. This is significant as Claudia Muzio had performed Norma with some success in Italy and South America, but staked no claim to the role over Raisa in Chicago.", "Most people in the United States believe that high quality opera broadcasts started with the Metropolitan Opera in 1931. The Chicago Opera was broadcasting nationally since 1927, every week for one hour; Mary Garden, Claudia Muzio, Frida Leider, Raisa, Tito Schipa, Eva Turner, Alexander Kipnis and Vanni-Marcoux are some of the headliners who were heard on the radio across America.
