He is the only player to have won the Division Three (South) Cup in two successive seasons, winning it with Bristol Rovers in 1935 and Coventry City in 1936.\nMcNestry, who was born in Chopwell, County Durham, started his footballing career playing for his home town club Chopwell Institute. In 1926 he had an unsuccessful trial with Arsenal and in August that year joined Bradford Park Avenue, with whom he made his Football League debut. He failed to settle with a club early in his career, only staying for a single season with Bradford and each of his next three clubs; Doncaster Rovers, Leeds United, and Sunderland.\nAfter joining Luton Town in 1930, McNestry finally became a first team regular and scored 26 times in 69 League games during a two-year stay. He joined Bristol Rovers in 1932 and stayed there for three years, playing 113 games and scoring 42 goals, before moving to Coventry City for two years from 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["In 1935\u201336 the club were finally, after several seasons of near-misses, promoted back to the Second Division, winning the Division Three South championship with another 100-goal season. With three games remaining the battle for promotion was between Coventry and Luton Town, with the two teams having to play each other home and away. Both games ended in dramatic draws, the Highfield Road encounter being played in front of a gate of 42,975 with many more refused entry. The final game against Torquay United was another thriller as George McNestry's second-half penalty was saved, and the team fell behind with fifteen minutes remaining in the game. With Luton drawing their final game, it seemed like promotion would be missed once again. The situation was rescued as Coventry equalised with another penalty, this time taken by Ernie Curtis, and they went on to win the game through a Clarrie Bourton goal with three minutes remaining. After the final whistle 10,000 fans invaded the pitch in celebration."]}, {"page": "McNestry, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge McNestry"]}, {"page": "McNestry", "response": ["#REDIRECT George McNestry"]}]}}
