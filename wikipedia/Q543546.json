Animated sequences would be cued to the guitar parts. The truck stop people would appear normal at first, but as they started to dance, hints of 'lizardness' would appear (flicking tongues, tails) with subtle prosthetics.

It featured a 40-second long ballet routine for which Minogue was coached by Rooney for four days. She admitted that the practice sessions were exhausting, but felt the final product became \"classy\" as a result. The singer felt \"lucky\" to be able to incorporate a ballet routine in the video and opined that it was \"a lot different\" from the rest of her repertoire. Julie Aspinall, author of the book Kylie: Queen of the World, wrote that Minogue adopted a \"Gallic chic style\" for the video. Aspinall felt that Minogue \"absolutely looked the part\" and suggested it was due to her being influenced by then-boyfriend Olivier Martinez, a French actor.

The video for \"Bag It Up\" is based around a humorous and raunchy nature. It begins with an advert promoting the male-behaviour-altering \"Girl Powder\". Girl Powder, administered in small doses, transforms any male into an obedient domestic servant and also a sex slave. The video starts with a domestic scene. Geri and her shirtless 'boyfriend' (played by Aiden Turner) are sitting down in a living room watching television when an advert comes on for Girl Powder, which declares that it is \"Heaven in a box\". Halliwell is seen doing all the housework and cooking for her 'boyfriend'. She then goes to the kitchen to make him coffee, when really she is preparing the Girl Powder drink. Once her boyfriend drinks it, his hair becomes pink and he has been transformed into a subservient male. The action then moves to the \"Girl Powder\" factory, where Geri has been transformed into a catsuit-clad superheroine boss, controlling (along with other females in white lab coats) a factory operated by many pink-haired men. The next time Geri and her boyfriend are seen, the roles have been reversed. Geri is now the one in control, with the semi-clad sex slave pandering to her every whim, even acting as a human table. We then return to the factory, where Geri eventually strips the oiled-up dancers down to hot pants, bunny ears and high-heeled ankle boots. Eventually they end up pole-dancing, acting as bunny boys and parodying Playboy Bunnygirls, this time with the male as the sex object. We then see Geri parading the bunny boys on a leash at the end of the video, exhorting female listeners to \"Treat him like a lady\" and declaring \"Who's wearing the trousers now?\".

Range wakes up again soon after, and stumbles out of the club with another man, where they begin to kiss, until she suddenly bites hard into his arm. Meanwhile, Buchanan takes a man outside, and she leads him into a dark alley, where they flirt briefly, before she scares him away. Buena then goes outside as well, and overpowers a man who towers over her. The music video ends with Buchanan and Buena accepting Range into the group, and dancing into the night.
