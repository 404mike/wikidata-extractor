He made his debut in a League Cup win at Burnley on August 22, 2006 in central midfield. He made a big impression during his first season with Pools and performed well at right-back, centre-half and midfield. He shared the Players' Player of the Year award with Michael Nelson that year as Pools were promoted back to League One at the first attempt. He remained a mainstay in the side. In 2010, Liddle was booked in a game at Leyton Orient, which meant an instant suspension was triggered after collecting his 10th yellow card of the season. However, no-one at the club realised he had been cautioned and he played 48 hours later against Brighton & Hove Albion. Pools then recognised later he should have not appeared and informed the FA. Pools were charged with fielding an ineligible player and deducted 3 points. That meant with 1 game of the season to go, they were in a relegation battle, but a draw at Brentford on the final day of the season kept them up. "]}]}}
