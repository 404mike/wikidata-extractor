Pollitt spent most of his life advocating communism. Ideologically a Marxist-Leninist, Pollitt was an adherent particularly of Joseph Stalin even after Stalin's death and disavowal by Khrushchev. Pollitt's acts included opposition to the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and Polish\u2013Soviet War, support for the Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, both support and opposition to the war against Nazi Germany, defence of the communist coup in Czechoslovakia, support for the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, and criticism of British colonialism. \nHe contested a number of parliamentary elections, but never won, despite coming close in 1945.
