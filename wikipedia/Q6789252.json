In an attempt to improve the club's goalscoring record, Stan Davies was signed from fellow First Division side Birmingham. Two others, Leslie Jones and Emlyn John also arrived from nearby Welsh sides Aberdare Athletic and Mid Rhondda respectively. Cardiff had undertaken a tour of Denmark at the end of the previous season and had shown interest in signing Creutz Jensen, who had impressed the club's delegation in one match. The board secured his signing on a free transfer but he was denied a work permit by the Ministry of Labour and the move, which would have seen him become the first foreign player in the club's history, subsequently collapsed."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Goalscoring proved an increasing issue for the side; in their next three fixtures Cardiff scored only once, Francis Harris adding his third goal of the season during a 1\u20130 victory over Barnsley on 19 October.

Miles scored again a week later, during a 2\u20131 win over Tottenham Hotspur, as Cardiff recorded consecutive victories for the first time during the campaign. He opened the scoring before Matt Robinson scored the winning goal with his first for the club.
