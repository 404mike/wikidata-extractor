It was profoundly wrong.\" In the Radio Times, Clare Short, who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood, said the series was \"totally unrepresentative\" of the area, and condemned it as \"crummy and misleading\". Others have also criticised Benefits Street, arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject. Labour MP Anne Begg, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee, said that the programme was a \"misrepresentation\" of people claiming benefits, arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of the overall welfare bill. Referring to the first episode that featured a shoplifter, Chris Williamson (also a Labour MP) said it was \"irresponsible\" to portray him as a typical benefits claimant. Owen Jones, a columnist for The Independent, described the series as \"medieval stocks updated for a modern format\". In an article for the Birmingham Mail, writer and television personality Samantha Brick, a native of Birmingham, said that the series was an \"atrociously unbalanced\" view of the city. Shadow Welfare Minister Chris Bryant claimed that the residents of The Bishop's Avenue in Hampsteadknown as Billionaire's Row because of its expensive propertieswere as likely to have drink and drugs problems as the residents of James Turner Street."]}, {"page": "MPs first elected in 2010 to the 55th UK Parliament", "response": ["| Chippenham||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Liberal Democrats||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Duncan Hames\u00a0(LD)||Chartered Accountant for Deloitte||1977"]}, {"page": "List of female members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom", "response": ["|Wife of fellow MP Duncan Hames."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2015 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Chippenham||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Liberal Democrats|| style=\"background-color: \"| ||\u00a0(C)||Seat gain, defeated incumbent Duncan Hames"]}]}}
