William Lewis made his Club and League debut on 8 September 1888, playing at centre\u2013forward, at Anfield, the then home of Everton. The home team defeated the visitors Accrington 2\u20131. William Lewis scored his debut Club and League goal (his only League goal for Everton and his only League goal in the top\u2013flight) on 29 September 1888, playing as a winger, at Pike's Lane, the then home of Bolton Wanderers. Everton were defeated by the home team 6\u20132, William Lewis scoring the first of Everton' two goals in the match. William Lewis appeared in three of the 22 League games played by Everton in season 1888\u201389 and scored one League goal. After the heavy defeat at Bolton Lewis did not play for Everton again and did not play top\u2013flight football again. When Lewis played for Manchester City the latter were in Division Two.Billy Lewis returned to Bangor in January 1889 before spells with Crewe Alexandra and Chester.In 1896 he moved to Manchester City, and he made 13 appearances for City, scoring on 4 occasions.Lewis gained 13 Welsh caps whilst with Chester, which remained a club record for more than 100 years. His record was broken when Angus Eve was capped 35 times for Trinidad and Tobago, although for 24 of these caps he was on loan away from Chester, and thus Lewis could still be argued to be the record holder.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
