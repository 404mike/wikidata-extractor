William Lewis made his Club and League debut on 8 September 1888, playing at centre\u2013forward, at Anfield, the then home of Everton. The home team defeated the visitors Accrington 2\u20131. William Lewis scored his debut Club and League goal (his only League goal for Everton and his only League goal in the top\u2013flight) on 29 September 1888, playing as a winger, at Pike's Lane, the then home of Bolton Wanderers. Everton were defeated by the home team 6\u20132, William Lewis scoring the first of Everton' two goals in the match. William Lewis appeared in three of the 22 League games played by Everton in season 1888\u201389 and scored one League goal. After the heavy defeat at Bolton Lewis did not play for Everton again and did not play top\u2013flight football again. When Lewis played for Manchester City the latter were in Division Two.Billy Lewis returned to Bangor in January 1889 before spells with Crewe Alexandra and Chester.In 1896 he moved to Manchester City, and he made 13 appearances for City, scoring on 4 occasions.Lewis gained 13 Welsh caps whilst with Chester, which remained a club record for more than 100 years. His record was broken when Angus Eve was capped 35 times for Trinidad and Tobago, although for 24 of these caps he was on loan away from Chester, and thus Lewis could still be argued to be the record holder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crewe Alexandra F.C.", "response": ["William Bell was the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham in February 1886.

The feat was achieved despite local amateur Alf Pugh starting in goal for Wales after the original selection, James Trainer, failed to arrive at the match. Pugh played the first 30 minutes before Wrexham's Sam Gillam arrived and took his place, thus becoming the first substitute ever used in international football. The following year, Wales played a home fixture outside the nation for the first time when a meeting with Ireland was held in Shrewsbury in an attempt to draw a large crowd. Wales won the match 5\u20132. By the early 1890s, with the domestic game thriving in England, Wales were struggling to get players released for international fixtures, particularly for away matches against Ireland which required a three-day absence from a player's club due to ferry travel. As a result, Wales finished bottom of the British Home Championship five times during the decade, including three consecutive seasons between 1891 and 1893. Wales did record their highest placed finish to date in 1895 by coming second to England after drawing all three of their fixtures, inspired by the likes of James Trainer, Billy Lewis and a debuting Billy Meredith."]}]}}
