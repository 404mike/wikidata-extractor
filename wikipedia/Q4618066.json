He was the founder of \"Modern Cornish\"/Curnoack Nowedga, which split off during the 1980s. Whereas Ken George mainly went to Medieval Cornish as the inspiration for his revival, Gendall went to the last surviving records of Cornish, such as John and Nicholas Boson, in the eighteenth-century. He taught at the University of Exeter.He was also a folk musician, and made several recordings with Brenda Wootton (e.g. Crowdy Crawn), as well as a poet and writer in Cornish itself under the bardic name of \"Gelvinak\".\nGendall founded Teere ha Tavaz, an organisation which seeks to promote the Cornish language in its Modern Cornish or Curnoack Nowedga variety. It is also a small publisher on, and in, the Cornish language.\nHe died in Liskeard, Cornwall in September 2017 at the age of 93. He belonged to a Penzance family which moved to St Blazey when he was very young and later to St Winnow. After wartime service in the Royal Navy he studied linguistics and music at the University of Leeds; then he was able to acquire some knowledge of the Cornish language from R. Morton Nance and A. S. D. Smith but was disappointed that it was no longer spoken. He started a campaign for the revival of Cornish as a spoken language.For many years he taught French and Spanish at Helston Grammar School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cornish language", "response": ["The revival focused on reconstructing and standardising the language, including coining new words for modern concepts, and creating educational material in order to teach Cornish to others. In 1929 Robert Morton Nance published his Unified Cornish system, based on the Middle Cornish literature while extending the attested vocabulary with neologisms and forms based on Celtic roots also found in Breton and Welsh, publishing a dictionary in 1938. Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish for most of the 20th century. During the 1970s, criticism of Nance's system, including the inconsistent orthography and unpredictable correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, as well as on other grounds such as the archaic basis of Unified and a lack of emphasis on the spoken language, resulted in the creation of several rival systems. In the 1980s, Ken George published a new system,  (\"Common Cornish\"), based on a reconstruction of the phonological system of Middle Cornish, but with an approximately morphophonemic orthography. It was subsequently adopted by the Cornish Language Board and was the written form used by a reported 54.5% of all Cornish language users according to a survey in 2008,Burley, Stuart. 2008.

Also during this period, Richard Gendall created his Modern Cornish system (also known as \"Revived Late Cornish\"), which used Late Cornish as a basis, and Nicholas Williams published a revised version of Unified; however neither of these systems gained the popularity of Unified or Kemmyn.", "A number of dictionaries are available in the different orthographies (a dictionary in the Standard Written Form has yet to be published), including  by Ken George,  by Nicholas Williams and A Practical Dictionary of Modern Cornish by Richard Gendall.

She was later able to move Pipers back to the Count House, and subsequently into Penzance at the Western Hotel. In 1973 she was introduced to Richard Gendall, who taught her two songs in Cornish to sing at that year's Pan Celtic Festival in Killarney in Ireland, and she welcomed the opportunity to sing in Cornwall's own language, Kernewek, pledging to sing at least one song in Cornish at every concert.

Unlike Kernewek Kemmyn, which tended to go to medieval Cornish for inspiration, Modern Cornish uses the latest known forms of Cornish from the 17th and 18th centuries from writers such as Nicholas Boson, John Boson, William Rowe, Thomas Tonkin and others, and Anglo-Cornish dialect words of Brittonic origin. Proponents of Kernewek Kemmyn claim that the later forms of Cornish are corrupt and anglicised, but supporters of Modern Cornish such as Cussel an Tavas Kernuak counter this by saying that they are continuing the natural evolution of the tongue where it left off.", "* Tavas a Ragadazow: The Language of My Forefathers by Richard Gendall (Teer ha Tavas, 2000)"]}, {"page": "Menheniot", "response": ["*Richard Gendall"]}, {"page": "Helena Sanders", "response": ["She became a member of Gorseth Kernow under the Bardic name of Maghteth Boudycca ('Daughter of Boudicca') at Trethevy Quoit in 1953.Gorseth Byrth Kernow (1967) Bards of the Gorsedd of Cornwall 1928-1967, Penzance: Gorseth She organised residential courses in the Cornish language, where Richard Gendall and Tony Snell met and wrote poetry in the language.", "*New Cornwall - a political magazine.
