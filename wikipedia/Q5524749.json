His first match in charge was a draw, followed by a run of 10 undefeated games. In March 2014, the club terminated Davies's employment, following a 5\u20130 defeat by Derby County. Neil Warnock turned down the job as Forest manager on the day Davies was sacked. After initially rejecting the job in March 2014, fans favourite Stuart Pearce was named the man to replace Billy Davies, taking over from caretaker manager Gary Brazil. He signed a two-year contract commencing on 1 July 2014. Pearce led Forest to an unbeaten start to the season but failed to keep up the form. He was sacked in February 2015 and replaced by another former Forest player, Dougie Freedman.", "On 18 May 2017, it was confirmed that Evangelos Marinakis had completed his takeover of Nottingham Forest, bringing an end to Al-Hasawi's reign as Forest owner. Incumbent manager Mark Warburton was sacked on 31 December 2017 following a 1\u20130 home defeat to struggling Sunderland, with a record of one win in seven. He was replaced by Spaniard Aitor Karanka, who arrived on 8 January 2018, immediately after caretaker manager Gary Brazil had masterminded a 4\u20132 home win over FA Cup holders Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup. Karanka made 10 new signings during the January transfer window. Following a 17th-place finish in the Championship for the 2017\u201318 season, Karanka made 14 new signings during the summer transfer window and the following season results improved. However, despite a strong league position, Karanka left his position on 11 January 2019 after requesting to be released from his contract. He was replaced with former Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill four days later. However, O'Neill was sacked in June after reportedly falling out with some of the senior first team players. He was replaced with Sabri Lamouchi on the same day. In Lamouchi's first season in charge, despite spending most of the season in the playoffs, Forest finished in 7th place despite sitting in 5th going into the final game. On 6 October 2020, Lamouchi was sacked by the club following a poor start to the 2020\u201321 season. He was replaced by former Brighton manager Chris Hughton. After an ultimately unsuccessful 11 months in charge, Hughton was sacked on 16 September 2021 after failing to win any of the club's opening 7 games of the 2021/22 season.", "|align=left| Gary Brazil", "|align=left| Gary Brazil", "|align=left| Gary Brazil", "|Director of football development|| Gary Brazil"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Gary Brazil", "|align=left|Gary Brazil"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 in English football", "response": ["* 10 October - Coach Gary Brazil takes over at Notts County, replacing Jocky Scott (sacked 10 October)", "* 7 January - Billy Dearden takes over at Notts County, replacing Gary Brazil (steps back down to coach)"]}, {"page": "Jack Hobbs (footballer)", "response": ["Hobbs was dropped from the first team in the first half of the 2016\u201317 season by manager Philippe Montanier, but was reinstated after Montanier was replaced by caretaker manager Gary Brazil.
