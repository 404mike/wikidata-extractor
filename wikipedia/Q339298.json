IGN, when reporting the statement, mentioned that the idea was not unfeasible, especially given that another 1991 side-scroller, Apogee's Duke Nukem, had just been ported to the same platform. No further mention was made of such a game until April 2001, when id CEO Todd Hollenshead said that such a game had been created, and had been submitted to Nintendo for approval. Activision formally announced at the start of May that a new Commander Keen game had been developed by David A. Palmer Productions, and would be released at the end of the month. An interview the following week with founder David A. Palmer explained that the original idea for the game came from id, who approached Activision to produce it; Activision in turn recommended Palmer as the developer for the project. Palmer greatly admired id's games, and had been attempting to get an agreement with id and Activision for several years for his studio to make a Game Boy Color version of several of their games, such as the 1993 Doom or 1996 Quake. While Palmer was the developer for the game\u2014with Palmer himself serving as the producer, Jim Meston as lead artist, and Mark Cooksey as composer\u2014id collaborated with the studio, with id having approval over game design elements and artist Adrian Carmack making some tile artwork for the game.", "Category:Video games scored by Mark Cooksey"]}, {"page": "Storm Warrior", "response": ["The game was poorly received.Review in Commodore DiskUser 14.
