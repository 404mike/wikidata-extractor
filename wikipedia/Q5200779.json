German night fighters intercept them over Belgium before they cross the German border and continue to attack them for the next hour, shooting down 82 bombers as they fly to Nuremberg and over the target. Another 13 bombers are lost on the return flight, and the total of 95 bombers lost (11.9 percent of the force) is the highest Bomber Command loss on a single raid during World War II. The raid inflicts little damage on Nuremberg due to cloud cover, wind, and poor target marking which cause most of the bombs to land in open countryside, and 120 aircraft mistakenly bomb Schweinfurt, where they scatter their bombs widely, also hitting mostly open countryside and killing two people. Pilot Officer Cyril Joe Barton, the pilot of a Halifax, pushes through to Nuremberg despite heavy damage to his bomber by a night fighter attack, then brings the aircraft home and dies in crash landing with only minor injuries to his crew. He posthumously receives the Victoria Cross."]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| Cyril Joe Barton || Royal Air Force || 1944 || Second World War || Nuremberg"]}, {"page": "Cyril Barton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Joe Barton"]}, {"page": "No. 578 Squadron RAF", "response": ["The first commanding officer was W/Cdr.
