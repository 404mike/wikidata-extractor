At the beginning of the Second World War, Hailstone felt the need to incorporate his artistic contribution to the war effort with more physical work. He therefore joined the Auxiliary Fire Service, AFS, and witnessed at first hand the destruction caused by bombing during the Blitz. He recorded some of these scenes in his paintings. A number of other artists had joined the AFS and a firemen artists' committee had been formed which also included Leonard Rosoman, Paul Lucien Dessau, Norman Hepple and Robert Coram alongside Hailstone. The group contributed to both War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and specialist civil defence art shows, including several firemen artists' exhibitions. In 1941 WAAC, commissioned Hailstone to paint civil defence subjects. He supplemented these works with portraits of his colleagues in the fire services and other war workers. His portrait of W. M. Ladbrooke, Able Seaman, Merchant Navy (National Maritime Museum, London), was painted following a visit to the Merchant Navy convalescent home in Limpsfield, Surrey around 1943."]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Norman Hepple (1908\u20131994)"]}, {"page": "Colfe's School", "response": ["* Norman Hepple RA RP (19081994), portrait painter"]}, {"page": "Thomas Murray MacRobert", "response": ["His portrait by Norman Hepple is held by the Hunterian Art Gallery in Glasgow.https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/thomas-murray-macrobert-18841962-professor-of-mathematics-138587"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"H\"", "response": ["*Norman Hepple (1908\u20131994), English portrait painter"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Goldsmiths, University of London", "response": ["*Norman Hepple"]}, {"page": "Leonard Rosoman", "response": ["A number of artists had joined the NFS and an firemen artists' committee had been formed which included Bernard Hailstone, Paul Lucien Dessau, Norman Hepple and Robert Coram as well as Rosoman.
