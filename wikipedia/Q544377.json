But by then it was too late. October 1978 was characterized by extreme unrest and open opposition to the monarchy; strikes paralyzed the country, and in early December a \"total of 6 to 9 million\"\u2014more than 10% of the country\u2014marched against the Shah throughout Iran.Kurzman, The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran (2004), p. 122 In October 1978, after flying over a huge demonstration in Tehran in his helicopter, Mohammad Reza accused the British ambassador Sir Anthony Parsons and the American ambassador William H. Sullivan of organising the demonstrations, screaming that he was being \"betrayed\" by the United Kingdom and the United States.Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 391. The fact that the BBC's journalists tended to be very sympathetic towards the revolution was viewed by most Iranians, including Mohammad Reza, as a sign that Britain was supporting the revolution. This impression turned out to be crucial, as the Iranian people had a very exaggerated idea about Britain's capacity to \"direct events\" in Iran.Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, pp. 391\u2013392. In a subsequent internal inquiry, the BBC found many of its more left-wing journalists disliked Mohammad Reza as a \"reactionary\" force, and sympathised with a revolution seen as \"progressive\".Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 392. Mohammad Reza spent much of his time working out various conspiracy theories about who was behind the revolution, with his favourite candidates being some combination of Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union.Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, pp. 385 & 409. Milani wrote that Mohamad Reza's view of the revolution as a gigantic conspiracy organised by foreign powers suggested that there was nothing wrong with Iran, and the millions of people demonstrating against him were just dupes being used by foreigners, a viewpoint that did not encourage concessions and reforms until it was too late. For much of 1978, Mohammad Reza saw his enemies as \"Marxist\" revolutionaries rather than Islamists. The Shah had exaggerated ideas about the power of the KGB, which he thought of as omnipotent, and often expressed the view that all of the demonstrations against him had been organised in Moscow, saying only the KGB had the power to bring out thousands of ordinary people to demonstrate.Milani, Abbas. The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 368. In October 1978, the oil workers went on strike, shutting down the oil industry and with it, Mohammad Reza's principal source of revenue.Milani, Abbas The Shah, London: Macmillan, 2011, p. 395. The Iranian military had no plans in place to deal with such an event, and the strike pushed the regime to the economic brink."]}, {"page": "Parsons (surname)", "response": ["*Sir Anthony Parsons (1922\u20131996), British diplomat, ambassador to Iran and to the United Nations"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Gwyneth Dunwoody, John Harvey-Jones, Tony Newton, Anthony Parsons"]}, {"page": "Presidency of the United Nations Security Council", "response": ["|Anthony Parsons", "|Anthony Parsons"]}, {"page": "Central Policy Review Staff", "response": ["The report was written by June 1977, shown to Ministers and published in August.

He left the Middle East for Europe in 1972 to become ambassador to Italy, Switzerland and Austria, serving until 1974. Nuseibeh changed continents once again when he became the Permanent Representative of Jordan at the United Nations in New York, United States in 1976. During his time as Permanent Representative he on numerous occasions fell out with the Israeli Representative Yehuda Zvi Blum. In December 1980 Nuseibeh partially based a speech on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, an anti-semitic hoax purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. For the speech he received severe criticism from Blum. Early in 1982 they fell out over the position of Palestinians in Jordan and Israel. Blum wished to point out that Palestinians already had a home in Jordan and referred to the country as \"the Palestinian Arab State of Jordan\", while Nuseibeh responded by calling Israel \"the Israeli entity\". During the discussion of the 1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands in the United Nations Security Council, Nuseibeh assured the Argentinian Representative, Eduardo Roca, that Jordan would vote against the United Kingdom. However, after a conversation between Nuseibeh and United Kingdom Representative, Anthony Parsons, the Jordanian vote would later be in favor of the United Kingdom in United Nations Security Council Resolution 502.
