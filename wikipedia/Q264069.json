In 1828 he began what became a major collection of pictures by contemporary or recent British artists. By 1850, he had collected some of the works of Thomas Gainsborough, J. M. W. Turner and numerous others including David Roberts, Edwin Landseer (such as Doubtful Crumbs), George Clarkson Stanfield, Thomas Webster, William Collins, William Etty and Augustus Wall Callcott.Dianne Sachko Macleod, \u201cArt collecting and Victorian middle-class taste,\u201d Art History, 10 (3) September 1987, pp.336-7  He became personally acquainted with most of the artists, entertained them in his home and paid them well. The house did not have a Long gallery, so Bicknell placed these works, with pieces of sculpture such as Edward Hodges Baily's Eve at the Fountain, throughout the rooms, and opened his house to art connoisseurs. Gustav Friedrich Waagen published a description and listing by room in his Treasures of Art in Great Britain. A visitor who came to see the collection in 1857 said, \"It could not have been formed in better taste.\"\u201dVisits to private galleries of the British School - The collection of Elhanan Bicknell, Esq., at Herne Hill,\u201d The Art-Journal, 1857, Vol III, p.10.
