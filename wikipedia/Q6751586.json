Funding problems resulted in the disbandment of this orchestra in 1931. In 1935, the BBC Welsh Orchestra was established as a 20-member ensemble, but the orchestra was dissolved with the advent of the Second World War in 1939. After the war, the BBC Welsh Orchestra was revived as a 31-member ensemble, with Mansel Thomas as its first principal conductor. In 1947, the BBC Welsh Chorus was founded as the affiliate chorus of the orchestra. The orchestra's ensemble size increased steadily, reaching 44 musicians in the 1960\u20131961 season, 60 musicians in 1974, and 66 musicians in 1976, when the orchestra's name was changed to the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra. It reached a full symphonic complement of 88 players in 1987 before being reduced to its current level of 78 players in 2014 as part of BBC savings delivered by Director at the time, Michael Garvey, who also made reductions to the administrative and management team through redundancies. In the 1970s, a new chorus to supplant the former BBC Welsh Chorus, the BBC Welsh Choral Society, was established. In 1993, the orchestra was renamed the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, to reflect more suitably its special role as both a national orchestra and a BBC Performing Group. In parallel, the chorus was renamed the BBC National Chorus of Wales. Both the orchestra and the chorus engage in outreach work through their Education and Community Outreach department, which creates access to the players and singers for Welsh schools, groups, communities and musicians of all abilities.", "* Mansel Thomas (1946\u20131950)"]}, {"page": "Magor, Monmouthshire", "response": ["The church is the burial place of Welsh composer Mansel Thomas."]}, {"page": "Mansel", "response": ["* Mansel Thomas (1909\u20131986), Welsh composer and conductor"]}, {"page": "1986 in Wales", "response": ["*8 January \u2013 Mansel Thomas, conductor and composer, 76"]}, {"page": "1969 in Wales", "response": ["*Mansel Thomas \u2013 Mini-Variations on a Welsh Theme"]}, {"page": "1949 in Wales", "response": ["*Grace Williams - Fantasia on Welsh Nursery Tunes - first recording, made by London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mansel Thomas (first recording of any work by a female Welsh composer)"]}, {"page": "1945 in Wales", "response": ["*Mansel Thomas \u2013 \"Y Bardd\""]}, {"page": "1941 in Wales", "response": ["*Mansel Thomas \u2013 The White Rose"]}, {"page": "1909 in Wales", "response": ["*12 June \u2013 Mansel Thomas, composer and conductor (died 1986)"]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Mansel Thomas (1909\u20131986), Welsh composer and conductor"]}, {"page": "Denis Griffiths", "response": ["His radio work during the 1950s included appearances as a soloist with popular singing groups of the time such as the Garth Players and he was, for a time, a member of the Lyrian Singers.
