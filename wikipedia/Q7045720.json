Despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing \"dingy and neglected [and in a] dismal state of decay\" the museum's \"numerous stunning exhibits\" notwithstanding.Frankland, Noble (1998) History at War: The Campaigns of an Historian (London: Giles de la Mare) p. 160 ", "The museum's director-general is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway, a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas, and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection.'Mr L. R. Bradley: Former Director of Imperial War Museum' (obituary) The Times 30 January 1968 p. 8 Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland. Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command, winning a Distinguished Flying Cross. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford, who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously director of the V&A Museum of Childhood. She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum.Heal, Sharon (January 2008) 'New chief at IWM revealed' Museums Journal 108/1 p. 8"]}, {"page": "Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester", "response": ["Although the Duke of Gloucester supported his brother, and later his niece, tirelessly and dutifully, he had a fondness for whisky.
