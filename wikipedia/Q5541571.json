Law became a favourite among the Ibrox fans for his determined, hard-tackling defensive style. Playing during the William Wilton era, he won a Scottish league championship medal in 1911, one Glasgow Cup, and two Glasgow Merchants Charity Cups. He never won a Scottish Cup, but did play in the abandoned 1909 Scottish Cup Final.Law left Rangers and moved to Leeds City in 1912. He retired after seven seasons in Yorkshire (interrupted by World War I) and a return to part-time Arbroath in the early 1920s.
