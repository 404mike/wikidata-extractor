Law became a favourite among the Ibrox fans for his determined, hard-tackling defensive style. Playing during the William Wilton era, he won a Scottish league championship medal in 1911, one Glasgow Cup, and two Glasgow Merchants Charity Cups. He never won a Scottish Cup, but did play in the abandoned 1909 Scottish Cup Final.Law left Rangers and moved to Leeds City in 1912. During World War I he returned to Glasgow to work at shipyards on the River Clyde, signing again for Rangers and spending a short time on loan with Partick Thistle.

After retirement from football, he went into the motor engineering business.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Rangers F.C. international footballers", "response": ["| George Law ||align=\"center\" | 5 March 1910|| align=\"center\"| 2 April 1910||align=\"center\"|3"]}, {"page": "1909\u201310 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|George Law"]}, {"page": "1916\u201317 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | George Law"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | George Law"]}, {"page": "1909 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|RB ||||George Law"]}, {"page": "1907\u201308 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | George Law"]}, {"page": "1908\u201309 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | George Law"]}, {"page": "George Law", "response": ["George Law may refer to:", "*George Law (financier) (1806\u20131881)", "*George Law Curry (1820\u20131878), governor of Oregon Territory", "*George Law (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*George Law (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u20131970), English footballer for Norwich City", "*George Law (cricketer) (1846\u20131911)", "*SS George Law, an 1850s steamship"]}, {"page": "1909\u201310 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | George Law"]}, {"page": "1910\u201311 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | George Law"]}, {"page": "1911\u201312 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | George Law"]}]}}
