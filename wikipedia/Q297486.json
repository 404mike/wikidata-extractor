Even with the hype boasting that Bunyan could replace Marianne Faithfull, who had recently departed Decca Records, her debut single, the Mick Jagger and Keith Richards-penned \"Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind\", did not achieve much critical traction. Sensing a follow-up release would not materialize, Bunyan decided to depart Oldham's stable to record with Peter Snell. Bunyan recorded \"Train Song\", the melody of which stemmed from her own composition, \"17 Pink Elephants\", with lyrics written by folkie Alastair Clayre. Upon release, however, \"Train Song\" failed to fulfil Bunyan's vision of her acoustic arrangements appealing to pop culture as the single was met with the same lack of commercial success as Bunyan's debut. As a result, the brief media exposure surrounding her faded by late 1966, Bunyan detached herself from the London music scene, and had been all but forgotten by mainstream pop audiences.", "Although Just Another Diamond Day was overlooked by the record-buying public at the time of its release, its critical stature has grown substantially over the years. Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, described the album as \"a pleasing yet overly dainty slice of British rock-tinged folk\" and goes on to say it was Bunyan's most seriously-minded effort up to that point. In his 2010 book, Electric Eden: Unearthing Britain's Visionary Music, author Rob Young states \"Vashti Bunyan's still, small voice of calm, and her bold improvised trek over Britain serves as a powerful symbol of the wider panorama of non-mainstream rock and folk\". Young goes on to say that Just Another Diamond Day's themes \"existed not in the traditional geographical locations of the British Rock scene...Instead it flowed from zones far more remote: the dual landscape/dreamscape of Britain's interior\".", "All songs written by Vashti Bunyan, except where noted.", "*Vashti Bunyan \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, recorder (4)", "Category:Vashti Bunyan albums"]}, {"page": "Lookaftering", "response": ["Lookaftering is the second studio album by Vashti Bunyan.
