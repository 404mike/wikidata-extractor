He was an integral part of successful Lancashire teams from 1926 to 1939, passing 1,000 runs in a season 13 times \u2013 every year except 1927 \u2013 and going on to 2,381 runs in 1934.\nHis best bowling season was 1932 when he took 80 wickets. In later years, he was inclined to be expensive and bowled less, but his best bowling performance of 9 for 42 in an innings in the Roses match against Yorkshire came in 1937, a season when he took only 28 wickets in all matches.\nIddon's Test cricket was confined to the 1934-35 tour to the West Indies, when he played in all four Test matches, and one match against the South African cricket team in 1935. In the Caribbean, he came second in the England batting averages despite never batting higher than No 7 in any innings; with George Paine and Eric Hollies in the side, his opportunities for bowling were limited to just seven overs. In the first match of the 1935 series, he again batted at No 7, scored 29 and bowled four overs for three runs. But he was dropped and never regained a Test place.\nIddon played for Lancashire in a couple of the non-first-class matches arranged after the end of the Second World War in Europe in 1945, but was not intending to resume full-time cricket in 1946, though the county hoped he would appear on occasion as an amateur and had appointed him team captain. He was working as a technical representative for a company making brake linings in Manchester, and he was on his way home from a business meeting at Rolls-Royce in Crewe when he was killed in a road accident just before the start of the 1946 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["When play began in 1946, after World War II, things started badly for Lancashire when the captain and veteran player, Jack Iddon, was killed in a car accident just before the start of the season. Jack Fallows stood in as captain for the season. His successor, Ken Cranston, was an unusual choice as he had no prior first-class experience; despite this his captaincy was not unsuccessful as Lancashire finished third and fifth during his two years in charge. In 1947 Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place both scored over 2,500\u00a0runs and scored 19\u00a0centuries between them. Washbrook's benefit took place in August 1948 and was watched by 50,000 people; he received \u00a314,000 (\u00a3 in ), beating the previous record by over \u00a310,000. Despite finishing 11th in 1949, in 1950\u00a0\u2013 under the captaincy of Nigel Howard\u00a0\u2013 Lancashire shared the county championship with Surrey, winning 16 matches; Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton claimed nearly 300\u00a0wickets between them. The 1950 season marked the emergence of Brian Statham. In the following three seasons, Lancashire finished third each time.

Fred Trueman made his debut in the 1949 game while his longtime England partner, Lancashire legend Brian Statham, made a big impact aged just 20 in his first Roses match in August 1950, when he shocked a packed Old Trafford crowd by falling flat on his face at the start of his opening spell. He picked himself up, dusted himself down and later that over ripped out Frank Lowson's middle stump.
