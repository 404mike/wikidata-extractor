Scotland dominated the game until a surprising fight-back by Italy in the last 10 minutes saw the Azzurri score three times to set up a tense finish. A close-fought but chaotic loss to Ireland by 13-22 came the following week, with further losses to France (10-27) and eventual Grand Slam winners Wales (11-18) in the ensuing rounds. In the last game of the competition, Scotland faced England at home in Twickenham. The first half was almost entirely one-sided, with England racing out to a 31-0 lead in the first 30 minutes, until Stuart McInally scored a breakaway try off a charge-down from English captain Owen Farrell. The second half witnessed a stunning comeback by the Scots, with a flurry of tries to Darcy Graham, Magnus Bradbury, Finn Russell and Sam Johnson putting Scotland into the lead by 38-31 with 4 minutes to go before a last-gasp try to replacement English fly-half George Ford, who then converted to level the final score at 38-38. The drawn result allowed Scotland to retain the Calcutta Cup, and was both the highest-scoring draw and the highest-scoring comeback of any rugby match on record."]}, {"page": "Boroughmuir RFC", "response": ["* Magnus Bradbury, Scotland International & Scotland 7's"]}, {"page": "Scotland national rugby sevens team", "response": ["* Magnus Bradbury*", "* Magnus Bradbury"]}, {"page": "Scotland A national rugby union team", "response": ["|Magnus Bradbury"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|1078||BradburyMagnus Bradbury||style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccffcc;\"|No.8/Back-row||2016-11-19|| v Argentina at Murrayfield"]}, {"page": "Russia at the Rugby World Cup", "response": ["|FL ||20||Magnus Bradbury || || "]}, {"page": "Scotland national under-20 rugby union team", "response": ["*Magnus Bradbury (Edinburgh Rugby/Boroughmuir)", "*Magnus Bradbury (Edinburgh Rugby/Boroughmuir)", "*Magnus Bradbury (Boroughmuir/Edinburgh Rugby)", "*Magnus Bradbury (Boroughmuir/Edinburgh Rugby) "]}, {"page": "Oban High School", "response": ["*Magnus Bradbury \u2013 rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Edinburgh Rugby season", "response": ["*  Magnus Bradbury - Back row"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Edinburgh Rugby season", "response": ["* Magnus Bradbury - Back row", "|BR||||Magnus Bradbury||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Edinburgh Rugby season", "response": [" Magnus Bradbury", "*  Magnus Bradbury from Scottish Rugby Academy", "|BR||||Magnus Bradbury||(4)||0||0||1(1)||1||0||1(5)||5"]}]}}
