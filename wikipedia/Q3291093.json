He obtained both an undergraduate degree and a doctorate before moving to the United States to teach at Columbia University.\nHe served as Professor of Physics at Yale University before returning to the United Kingdom in 1994 to start the Sussex Centre for Optical and Atomic Physics at Sussex University.He is currently (2014) a Royal Society Research Professor and Director of the Centre for Cold Matter at Imperial College London where his research is concentrated on fundamental problems in physics and on new methods for producing and manipulating cold atoms and molecules.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 8", "response": ["*1949 \u2013 Edward Hinds, English physicist and academic"]}, {"page": "Jesus College, Oxford", "response": ["The founders' hopes that their college would produce prominent Welsh clergy were fulfilled in no small measure when a former student, A. G. Edwards, was elected the first Archbishop of Wales when the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. Two later Archbishops of Wales, Glyn Simon (Archbishop from 1968 to 1971) and Gwilym Owen Williams (Archbishop 1971\u20131982) were also educated at the college. Celticists associated with the college include Sir John Rhys, Sir John Morris-Jones, and Sir Thomas (T. H.) Parry-Williams, whilst the list of historians includes the college's first graduate, David Powel, who published the first printed history of Wales in 1584, the Victorian historian J. R. Green, and the historian Richard J. Evans. Angus Buchanan won the Victoria Cross during the First World War. Record-breaking quadriplegic solo sailor Hilary Lister was also a student here, whilst from the field of arts and entertainment there are names such as Magnus Magnusson, presenter of Mastermind, the National Poet of Wales Gwyn Thomas, and television weather presenters Kirsty McCabe and Si\u00e2n Lloyd.
