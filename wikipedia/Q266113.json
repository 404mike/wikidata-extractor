To achieve this, DFID distributed most of its money to governments and other international organisations that had already developed suitable programmes, and let them distribute the money as efficiently as possible. In July 2009, DFID rebranded all its aid programmes with the UK aid logo, to make clear the contributions were coming from the people of the United Kingdom. While the decision was met with some controversy among aid workers at the time, Commons International Development Select Committee Chairman Malcolm Bruce explained the rebranding saying \"the name DFID does not reflect the fact that this is a British organisation; it could be anything.

According to former MP Evan Harris, one of Laws's former colleagues, \"Laws is a fully social liberal on equality, abortion, faith schools, religion and the state.
