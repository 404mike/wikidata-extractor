An idea becoming realised, Stuart's brother and keyboard player, Struan Eaglesham, was offered a place in the line-up, as was piper Allan Wilson from Bonar Bridge. Roger Niven from the Black Isle played guitar, but was soon replaced by Andy Murray. In 1989, Wolfstone performed their opening show at the first Highland Traditional Music Festival in Dingwall, supplemented by sequenced bass and drums. Following this, the band ran the usual Highlands and Islands village dance hall circuit, gaining live experience. It was clear that this was a worthwhile venture, the gigs earning them more than their day jobs. During this period, Wolfstone recorded two albums - Wolfstone and Wolfstone II respectively - on Rowan Records, utilising sequencing machines over a standard rhythm section. These albums were produced by David Foster, who also contributed vocals to some of the tracks. However, he parted ways with Wolfstone in 1990 over disagreement on the band's direction. Also in 1990, Orcadian Ivan Drever joined the band on vocals, guitars, and songwriting duties. Soon, Wolfstone were offered a recording contract with Iona Records in Glasgow, and in 1991, began work on Unleashed, allowing them to guest drummer John Henderson and bassist Neil Hay for a decidedly more authentic sound. Mid-process, they were offered a support slot at Runrig's major Loch Lomond Midsummer event,Morton, Tom: Going Home, page 200. Mainstream, 1991.  alongside such acts as CapercaillieMorton, Tom: Going Home, page 201, 202. Mainstream, 1991. and Hothouse Flowers.Morton, Tom: Going Home, page 197, 201. Mainstream, 1991. This exposure brought the band larger gigs and shows, playing to new audiences. Ultimately, Unleashed was a success, achieving silver status in the UK.", "Wolfstone perform pieces from the traditional folk and Celtic repertoire permeated with rock and roll sensibilities. This was perhaps most obvious on the early Wolfstone and Wolfstone II albums which featured prominent walking bass-lines. As well as this, the band is also a source of both original tunes and songs. Previous material stemmed, though not exclusively, from collaborations between Ivan Drever and Duncan Chisholm, as well as Drever's own compositions. Only more recently have Duncan Chisholm and Stuart Eaglesham written songs together. Wolfstone's songs vary greatly in subject matter. They explore emigration and displacement (\"Burning Horizons\", \"Braes of Sutherland\"), social injustice (\"Close It Down\", \"Brave Foot Soldiers\") and conflict (\"White Gown\", \"Brave Boys\"), amongst other things. They have also recorded several traditional songs which happen to work well in a rock setting", "* Ivan Drever \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, cittern (1990\u20131998) ", "* The Lewis Blue (1998) (An album by Duncan Chisholm and Ivan Drever, lead members of Wolfstone at the time of release)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Ivan Drever, folk singer, songwriter and guitarist"]}, {"page": "John Gow", "response": ["* Ivan Drever - The Ballad of Pirate Gow"]}, {"page": "The Chase (Wolfstone album)", "response": ["*Ivan Drever: guitar, lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Seven (Wolfstone album)", "response": ["The band recorded the album with new drummer Tony Soave and co-producer Rob Rankin from December 1998 \u2013 January 1999, and was the band's first album where Stuart Eaglesham took over as lead vocalist, following the departure of former lead singer Ivan Drever in 1998. The band themselves were pleased with the album, with Mackenzie saying \"as a band we were happy with Seven, it met our expectations of ourselves.\" The album was released in May 1999 and received positive reviews from music critics. Allmusic said \"fans of the band will not be disappointed,\" whilst The Living Tradition said that \"with this album Wolfstone prove they are bigger than any one member and they \"rock on\".\" The band decided to carry on as a band and toured in promotion of Seven in 2000, resulting in the live album Not Enough Shouting, which, among its fourteen tracks, features nine of the eleven tracks on Seven recorded live. Seven and Not Enough Shouting were the band's only albums with pianist-keyboardist Andy Simmers, who committed suicide in April 2000; he had contributed a sombre solo piano instrumental, \"John Simmers\", to Seven.", "In 1996, Wolfstone, then led by Ivan Drever and Stuart Eaglesham, both of whom wrote, sang and played guitar for the band, released their fourth album The Half Tail to critical acclaim. The album was recorded at CaVa Studios, Glasgow, a break from their usual Edinburgh studio of Palladium Studios, and featured a change of producer in Chris Harley.The Half Tail liner notes. After the release of the album, the line-up slightly changed when keyboardist Struan Eaglesham left the band to start a family. He was replaced by long-time friend and colleague Andy Thorburn, but after \"relentless\" touring around the globe, drummer Graeme \"Mop\" Youngson also left the band, as the rigours of being on the road and away from home on an almost constant basis had a \"telling effect\" on his health. Shortly afterwards, the band had intentions of breaking up, but continued to fill contractual obligations in the form of already booked live concerts throughout 1998\u20131999. In this period, Aberdonian Ronnie Simpson joined the band on drums and Andy Simmers from Inverness played keyboards.", "The album was released on 18 May 1999 by Green Linnet Records. Although it is the band's fifth official studio album, the album was named Seven as it is their seventh \"official\" album overall, including This Strange Place and 1997 compilation Pick of the Litter, disregarding the band's early, originally unreleased albums. The album was released to critical acclaim, with critics impressed with the band after the departure of Drever. Rick Anderson of Allmusic rated the album four stars out of five and said that \"fans of the band will not be disappointed.\" He called the instrumentals \"fine\" and complimented Eaglesham's melody on \"Brave Boys\" as \"lovely\". Chris Mackenzie of The Living Tradition was also very favourable, commending the band's strength after the departure of Drever, saying \"with this album Wolfstone prove they are bigger than any one member and they \"rock on\".\" He said \"Ivan Drever's absence might not make a huge difference to the Wolfstone sound in full flight but he defined the vocal sound of the band. Despite Ivan and Stuart Eaglesham sharing vocal duties over the last few albums, Ivan was the Wolfstone sound. Well he isn't anymore, Stuart has the floor, and he acquits himself well.\" He described \"Quinie Fae Ryhnie\" as \"excellent\" and \"John Simmers\" as \"delightful\". Duke Egbert of The Daily Vault was less favourable, grading the album \"B\u2013\" and questioning the near-absence of bagpipes.
