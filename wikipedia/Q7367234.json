They are in many ways alike: selfish, unsuccessful, and physically and personally unattractive - although Tom less so. The hapless duo live in a Kentish Town flat (69 Paradise Passage, Kentish Town) rented from elderly ex-prostitute Beryl Merit (Rosalind Knight). Other regular characters are the middle-class, horny married couple Jez (Brian Bovell) and Suze (Beth Goddard). Many of the storylines revolve around the fact that Tom and Linda find Jez sexually attractive and (particularly Linda) despise the oblivious Suze. Another recurring character is Sugar Walls (Elaine Lordan), Linda's celebrity sister. Many of the other characters can be just as hapless as Tom and Linda; Beryl still engages in sexual activities such as S&M and picking up young and married men, while Jez and Suze generally lack common sense. For example, they once cancelled their holiday to the Algarve and paid \u00a3500 to stay in their own back garden after Linda opened it up as a campsite.", "Beryl Merit (Rosalind Knight) \u2013 Beryl is the elderly landlady of 69 Paradise Passage.

Coincidentally, UNESCO is offering the best academically qualified school in England an expenses paid tour to various European cities, ending in Rome: they will play at the Vienna Music Festival and play in a series of field hockey and water polo matches against school teams. Of course, St Trinian's is the last possible candidate for the tour. Harry returns with the news of the Prince's offer, but is at a loss how to get the girls to Rome before their term ends in July.
