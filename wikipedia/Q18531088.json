He was born on 7 February 1779 in Canterbury, and educated at The King's School, Canterbury. He entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 1 January 1796, migrating to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge on 18 October of the same year. He graduated B.A. 1800, M.A. 1803, B.D. 1810, D.D.

On 17 October 1813 he was elected master of Sidney Sussex, and held that office until his death. During his mastership the college was refaced at his expense; many of his books were also presented by him to the college library. In 1813, and again in 1829, he was vice-chancellor of the university. He was also chaplain in ordinary to George III, George IV, William IV, and Queen Victoria. He died at Cambridge 16 May 1843, and was buried in the chapel of his college.\nDr. Chafy married, on 4 December 1813, Mary, youngest daughter of John Westwood of Chatteris in the Isle of Ely, by whom he had one child, a son, William Westwood Chafy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge", "response": ["While the college's geographic size has changed little since 1596, an additional range was added to the original E-shaped buildings in the early 17th century and the appearance of the whole college was changed significantly in the 1820s and 1830s, under the leadership of the Master at the time, William Chafy.

In 1830, he was invited by the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, William Chafy, to design  a new botanic garden for the university. The expense of acquiring the necessary land caused the plan to be shelved, and Lapidge waited for more than ten years for his bill to be paid. The gardens were eventually laid out in the mid-1840s, but not under his supervision."]}]}}
