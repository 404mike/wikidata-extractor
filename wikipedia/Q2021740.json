Frederick leaves service at the Bellamy house in the eleventh instalment \"Alberto\" when he discovers the allure of escorting young upper-class women to balls and other functions. Also during this season, the roles played by actresses Jenny Tomasin and Joan Benham were expanded to show more character depth. For Tomasin, the role of the childlike, simple-minded kitchen maid Ruby Finch was showcased in two episodes - the eighth instalment \"Such A Lovely Man\" where Ruby meets a man named Herbert through magazine correspondence, but rejects him because \"he was no Rudolph Valentino\"; and the fourteenth chapter of the series, \"Noblesse Oblige\" in which Ruby, fed up and disgusted with Mrs. Bridges's treatment of her, temporarily leaves her position at Eaton Place after they have a bitter quarrel. Benham's character of Lady Prudence Fairfax (or \"Pru\" as she was affectionately referred to) had been featured throughout the previous four series as a long time close friend of the Bellamy family who was a delightful social butterfly always welcome at family parties and events, as well as a harmless gossipy woman. However, in the fifth series, Benham was able to show another side of Lady Prudence - as a wise, kind, loyal, loving, and devoted friend to the Bellamys in two instalments - in the fourth episode \"Joy Ride\" and the eleventh episode \"Alberto\"."]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Barry McKenzie", "response": ["*Jenny Tomasin as Sarah Gort"]}, {"page": "List of Upstairs, Downstairs episodes", "response": ["The series is set during the period 1903\u20131930 and takes place largely in the London town house of the Bellamy family.

Whilst Hoover and Electrolux dominated the top end of the British vacuum cleaner market, Goblin continued to sell large numbers of cheaper cleaners. Popular models included the 1970s \"Housemaid\" cleaner (with an advertising campaign featuring Jenny Tomasin of Upstairs, Downstairs fame) and the compact \"Rio\" cleaner of the 1980s. In the early 1980s the company changed its name to BVC, British Vacuum Cleaners, though the new name never stuck with staff and locals.
