Selznick decided to add an Automaton to the storyline after reading Gaby Wood's 2007 book Edison's Eve, which tells the story of Edison's attempt to create a talking wind-up doll.  M\u00e9li\u00e8s owned a set of automata, which were sold to a museum but lay forgotten in an attic for decades. Eventually, when someone re-discovered them, they had been ruined by rainwater. At the end of his life, M\u00e9li\u00e8s was destitute, even as his films were screening widely in the United States. He sold toys from a booth in a Paris railway station, which provides the setting of the story. Selznick drew M\u00e9li\u00e8s's real door in the book, as well as real columns and other details from the Montparnasse railway station in Paris, France.", "One of Selznick's inspirations to incorporate an automaton into the story was the book titled Edison\u2019s Eve: A Magical Quest for Mechanical Life by Gaby Wood, which includes a chapter on Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s' collection of automata. His automata were kept in a museum in Paris but were later thrown away. Selznick's original idea was to have Hugo find an automaton in a pile of garbage and fix it. At that time, Selznick began his research on automata and the curator at the Franklin Institute allowed him to study their automaton. The history of the automaton at the institute also had a mysterious origin that was similar to what Selznick had in mind. The automaton donated to the Institute suffered major damage from a fire. It was believed at the time of donation that it was made by a French inventor named Maelzel. However, after a member of staff fixed it and got it to work, the automaton wrote at the end of a poem in French: \"Ecrit par L'Automate de Maillardet\" \u2014 translated as \"Written by the automaton of Maillardet\", revealing its true maker to be Henri Maillardet. After many different ideas, Selznick settled on the story that Hugo's father had a connection with the automaton and died before the automaton was found in a burned-out building. The automaton illustrated in the book has many elements that resemble the automaton at the institute."]}, {"page": "Rufus Does Judy at Carnegie Hall", "response": ["Part of the success of the tribute concerts can be attributed to the amount of press attention received and the eagerness of other artists to participate in the event.
