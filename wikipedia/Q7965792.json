He apprenticed to a piano maker and then worked as a pianist before returning to acting, making his London debut in 1890.  In 1893, Passmore joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, soon becoming the company's principal comedian.  He created roles in the original productions of the last two Gilbert and Sullivan operas and in many other Savoy Operas.  He also played the patter roles in several Gilbert and Sullivan revivals, and he also toured for the company.\nIn 1903, Passmore left the company and began a career in musical comedies, plays and pantomimes in London's West End and on tour that lasted for thirty years.  His West End appearances included roles in such important productions as The Earl and the Girl (1903), The Talk of the Town (1905) and Madame Pompadour (1924).
