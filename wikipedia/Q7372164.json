He is most noted for his design of the Winter Garden, Dublin (1865), for his detailed work on the single-span roof of London's St Pancras railway station, undertaken with William Henry Barlow (1868) and the Albert Bridge, a crossing of the River Thames in London, completed in 1873.Born in Melbourne, Derbyshire, Ordish was the son of a land agent and surveyor. He worked with Charles (later Sir Charles) Fox, who was responsible for the construction of Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London in 1851. He subsequently supervised its re-erection in Sydenham, south London.His other projects included:\n\nFarringdon Street Bridge, London\nHolborn Viaduct, London (1863\u201369)\nDerby market hall (1866)\nFranz Joseph I Suspension Bridge, over the Vltava, Prague (1868, bombed 1941, demolished in 1947)\nCavenagh Bridge, Singapore (1869)\nEsplanade Mansions, Mumbai, India (1869)\ndome of Royal Albert Hall, London (1871)\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal Albert Hall", "response": ["The dome (designed by Rowland Mason Ordish) was made of wrought iron and glazed.

The arches' ribs had a web depth of , mostly open ironwork.

Mindful of the impact the new bridge would have on older bridge's financial viability, the 1864 Act of Parliament authorising the Albert Bridge compelled the Albert Bridge Company to purchase Battersea Bridge at the time of the new bridge's opening and to compensate the owners of Battersea Bridge with \u00a33,000 (about \u00a3 in ) per annum until the new bridge opened, and so Battersea Bridge was bought outright by the Albert Bridge Company in 1873. By this time the bridge was in extremely poor condition, and there were many calls from local residents for it to be demolished. As an interim measure, the Albert Bridge's architect Rowland Mason Ordish strengthened the foundations of the bridge with concrete while debate continued as to its future."]}, {"page": "William Henry Barlow", "response": ["Between 1862 and 1869, Barlow was consultant engineer for the Midland Railway's southern extension from Bedford to London, including the layout of the London terminus station at St Pancras on Euston Road. To deal with the sloping site and the need to cross the Regent's Canal a short distance to the north, the platforms were constructed on a raised structure supported on cast iron columns and girders. Under this structure, storage was laid out for beer from the breweries at Burton upon Trent. With assistance from Rowland Mason Ordish, Barlow also designed the arched, cast iron station canopy which spans  across the platforms without intermediate support \u2013 then the widest of its kind in the world.

Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish\u2013Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, it proved to be structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.", "Rowland Mason Ordish was appointed to design the new bridge. Ordish was a leading architectural engineer who had worked on the Royal Albert Hall, St Pancras railway station, the Crystal Palace and Holborn Viaduct. The bridge was built using the Ordish\u2013Lefeuvre system, an early form of cable-stayed bridge design which Ordish had patented in 1858. Ordish's design resembled a conventional suspension bridge in employing a parabolic cable to support the centre of the bridge, but differed in its use of 32\u00a0inclined stays to support the remainder of the load. Each stay consisted of a flat wrought iron bar attached to the bridge deck, and a wire rope composed of 1,000  diameter wires joining the wrought iron bar to one of the four octagonal support columns."]}, {"page": "Watson's Hotel", "response": ["Watson's Hotel was designed by the civil engineer Rowland Mason Ordish, who had worked on the Crystal Palace in London in 1850, and went on to design a number of cast and wrought-iron structures such as bridges and market halls, notably the Albert Bridge in London the St Pancras Station station roof (co-designer). The building's cast iron and wrought-iron components were prefabricated by the Phoenix Foundry Company in Derby, England, and assembled on site. The iron frame is composed of relatively large-scale pieces, heavier than that used on the Crystal Palace, able to support the five levels, timber and tile floors, and the infill brick walling.
