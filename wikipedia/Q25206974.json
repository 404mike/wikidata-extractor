The inaugural tournament was won by Scotland who won all three of their ties. Having defeated Ireland 6\u20130 in their opening match, Wales went on to finish third after suffering successive defeats to England and Scotland. The early stages of the competition continued on the same lines; England and Scotland competed for the title, while Wales would finish third by defeating Ireland. In the first three years of competition, Wales' only points other than in matches against Ireland was a 1\u20131 draw with England in the 1884\u201385 tournament. In the 1886\u201387 edition, Wales finished bottom of the competition for the first time after losing all three of their matches, including a 4\u20131 defeat to Ireland in the nation's first victory in international football. Wales had struggled to raise a team for the match and included Wrexham defender Bob Roberts playing as the goalkeeper. FAW secretary Alexander Hunter also stepped in when Humphrey Jones withdrew late. Hunter had never played football at such a level and his performance was described as \"glaringly deficient\"."]}]}}
