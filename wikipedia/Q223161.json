He is best known for his idiosyncratic work in electronic styles such as techno, ambient, and jungle. Music journalists from publications including Mixmag, The New York Times, NME, Fact, Clash and The Guardian have called James one of the most influential or important contemporary electronic musicians.Raised in Cornwall, James began DJing at free parties and clubs in the area in the late 1980s, and later at venues around the West Country. His debut EP, Analogue Bubblebath, was released in 1991 on Mighty Force Records. It brought James acclaim and a cult following; he began to perform at techno clubs and raves across the UK and continental Europe. James co-founded the independent label Rephlex Records the same year.\nJames's 1992 debut album Selected Ambient Works 85\u201392, released by Belgian label Apollo, garnered wider critical and popular appreciation. That year, he also appeared on the influential Warp Records compilation Artificial Intelligence. He signed to Warp the following year and subsequently released charting albums such as ...I Care Because You Do (1995) and Richard D James Album (1996), as well as Top 40 singles \"On\" (1993), \"Come to Daddy\" (1997), and \"Windowlicker\" (1999). With music videos directed by Chris Cunningham, \"Come to Daddy\" and \"Windowlicker\" brought James significantly wider international attention.\nAfter releasing Drukqs in 2001, James spent several years releasing music on his own Rephlex label, including the 2005 Analord EP series, and a pair of 2007 releases under the alias the Tuss. In 2014, he made available a previously unreleased 1994 LP as Caustic Window. He returned later that year with the album Syro, which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album. He has since released charting EPs including Cheetah (2016) and Collapse (2018).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "AphexTwin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Aphex Twin"]}, {"page": "The Beach Boys", "response": ["Discussing Smiley Smile, Daniel Harrison argues that the album could \"almost\" be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that the group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, \"The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable ... as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces.\" However, such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically minded at the time. Harrison concludes: \"What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, Friends, and 20/20 sound like few other rock albums; they are sui generis. ... It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation.\" Musicologist David Toop, who included the Smiley Smile track \"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\" on a companion CD for his book Ocean of Sound, placed the Beach Boys' effect on sound pioneering in league with Les Baxter, Aphex Twin, Herbie Hancock, King Tubby, and My Bloody Valentine."]}, {"page": "Cornwall", "response": ["Contemporary musician Richard D.

The Godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 1990s rave scene. After initially hosting small nights in Cambridge and Northampton, the associated events scaled up at the Sanctuary Music Arena in Milton Keynes, in Birmingham and in Leeds. A new indie dance scene also emerged in the 1990s. In New York, bands such as Deee-Lite furthered house's international influence.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz).Nicholson, Stuart (January 3, 2003), \"Jazztronica: A Brief History of the Future of Jazz\", JazzTimes.

Techno was created by three musicians from Detroit, often referred to as the 'Belleville three' (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson & Derrick May), who fused the repetitive melodies of Kraftwerk with funk rhythms. The Belleville three were heavily influenced by Kraftwerk and their sounds because Kraftwerk's sounds appealed to the middle-class blacks residing in Detroit at this time.

While on the one hand it does seem the most convenient catch-all phrase, under any sort of scrutiny it begins to implode. In its original 1992-93 sense it was largely coterminous with the more explicitly elitist 'intelligent techno', a term used to establish distance from and imply distaste for, all other more dancefloor-oriented types of techno, ignoring the fact that many of its practitioners such as Richard James (Aphex Twin) were as adept at brutal dancefloor tracks as what its detractors present as self-indulgent ambient 'noodling'\".

At the same time, the UK market was saturated with increasingly frenetic breakbeat and sample-laden hardcore techno records that quickly became formulaic. Rave had become a \"dirty word,\" so as an alternative, it was common for London nightclubs to advertise that they were playing \"intelligent\" or \"pure\" techno, appealing to a \"discerning\" crowd that considered the hardcore sound to be too commercial.", "Wider public use of such terms on the Internet came in August 1993, when Alan Parry announced the existence of a new electronic mailing list for discussion of \"intelligent\" dance music: the \"Intelligent Dance Music list\", or \"IDM List\" for short.[Intelligent Dance Music] \"is a forum for the discussion of what has been termed 'intelligent' music \u2013 that is, music that moves the mind, not just the body.

Jenkinson said of Plug's track \"Military Jazz,\" \"This track came on and, amongst the road noise and chatter, I heard what I thought was some sort of hip-hop track being played by a band.

Jesse Saunders, known as The Originator of House Music, was the first producer to change the art of remixing by creating his own original music, entirely replacing the earlier track, then mixing back in the artist's original lyrics to make his remix. He introduced this technique for the first time with the Club Nouveau song \"It's a Cold, Cold World\", in May 1988.  Another clear example of this approach is Roberta Flack's 1989 ballad \"Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)\", which Chicago House great Steve \"Silk\" Hurley dramatically reworked into a boisterous floor-filler by stripping away all the instrumental tracks and substituting a minimalist, sequenced \"track\" to underpin her vocal delivery, remixed for the UK release which reached No1 pop by Simon Harris.  The art of the remix gradually evolved, and soon more avant-garde artists such as Aphex Twin were creating more experimental remixes of songs (relying on the groundwork of Cabaret Voltaire and the others), which varied radically from their original sound and were not guided by pragmatic considerations such as sales or \"danceability\", but were created for \"art's sake\"."]}, {"page": "NME", "response": ["In 2000, Steve Sutherland left to become brand director of the NME, and was replaced as editor by 26-year-old Melody Maker writer Ben Knowles.
