This decision was widely perceived by the public as a deliberate attempt by the mine owners and Inspectorate to cover up any evidence of their culpability in the cause of the explosion.

It is probable that resentment at the dominance of the North Wales industry by Yorkshire, represented by Smith and Hall, played a part in their decision."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Miners' Association", "response": [":1938: Joe Hall"]}, {"page": "Joseph Arthur Hall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Hall (trade unionist)"]}]}}
