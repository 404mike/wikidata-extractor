Renowned for his storytelling musical style in his DJ sets as well as for his energy and enthusiasm in the DJ booth, his style encompasses the deeper and groovier end of house and techno. Equally suited to night time as they are for sunrise or sunset events.  Burridge was a member of England's Tyrant Soundsystem (along with DJs Craig Richards and Sasha) and has mixed albums for labels such as Balance, Fabric, Global Underground and Hooj Choons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Homelands (festival)", "response": [":Lee Burridge"]}, {"page": "Global Underground", "response": ["* Nubreed 005 (2001) by Lee Burridge", "* GU247002 Lee Burridge, release date: 15 September 2003"]}, {"page": "V Festival", "response": ["* Shockwaves Club Tent: Pete Bromley, Sander Kleinenberg, Guy Ornadel, Sasha, Seb Fontaine, Hybrid, Junkie XL, Lee Burridge, Dean Wilson, Craig Richards"]}, {"page": "Sander Kleinenberg", "response": ["In 2005, Kleinenberg began a monthly residency at Crobar, New York City, using it to push the \"Everybody\" brand.
