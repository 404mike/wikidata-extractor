Replacing Cardiff team mate George Avery Young, Bland was chosen to face England in the opening match of the tournament, under the captaincy of Newport's Charlie Newman. Although the match was to be played at Stradey Park in Llanelli, the game was moved to a nearby cricket ground as the English felt the original pitch was still frozen-over. The game ended in a nil-nil draw, the best the Welsh had so far achieved over the English. Bland kept his place for the next two games of the Championship, a loss away to Scotland; where Wales unsuccessfully trialed the four three-quarter system for the first time, and a win over Ireland, played at the neutral ground of Birkenhead Park in England."]}, {"page": "George Avery", "response": ["* George Avery Young (1866\u20131900), English sportsman who played rugby and cricket"]}]}}
