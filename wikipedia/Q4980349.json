Turner, argue in their article, \"Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn,\" that cultural studies, particularly the flavor championed by Stuart Hall, lacks a stable research agenda, and privileges the contemporary reading of texts, thus producing an ahistorical theoretical focus.  Many, however, would argue, following Hall, that cultural studies have always sought to avoid the establishment of a fixed research agenda; this follows from its critique of disciplinarity.  Moreover, Hall and many others have long argued against the misunderstanding that textual analysis is the sole methodology of cultural studies, and have practiced numerous other approaches, as noted above.  Rojek and Turner also level the accusation that there is \"a sense of moral superiority about the correctness of the political views articulated\" in cultural studies.Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner. 2000. \"Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn.\" The Sociological Review 48(4):629\u201348."]}, {"page": "Social construction of the body", "response": ["The social construction of the body is a hypothesis that affirms that the relationship between the body and the socio-cultural context occurs in both senses, and that society and culture influence the formation of its members to some extent.Guerra Carrasco, Ren\u00e9 (2005). \"Donaci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos: compresi\u00f3n y significado.\".

Thus, medicine and religion can be mentioned as the agents that have traditionally influenced, together with the rules of urbanity and educational institutions. These four agents have been building a model, which every individual has as reference. According to Bryan S. Turner, the social construction of the body is: \"The nearest and immediate feature of my social self, a necessary feature of my social situation and my personal identity, and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in the natural environment\""]}, {"page": "Nicholas Abercrombie", "response": ["* (Co-authored with Stephen Hill and Bryan S.
