Taylor's first game after signing for the club on a permanent basis came in the opening game of the season, in a 3\u20132 loss against Leeds United. He started in the next four matches, playing once in the left\u2013back position and three times in the left\u2013midfield position. However, Taylor suffered a calf injury that kept him out for weeks. He then made his return from injury, starting a match in the centre\u2013back position against West Ham United on 19 September 2017 in the third round of the League Cup, losing 3\u20130. However, Taylor suffered a back injury during a 1\u20131 draw against Fulham on 28 October 2017 and was sidelined for a month as a result. It wasn't until on 23 December 2017 when he returned to the starting line\u2013up, in a 2\u20130 win against Cardiff City. However, his return was short\u2013lived when Taylor suffered an injury during a 2\u20130 loss against his former club, Middlesbrough on 26 December 2017. Upon returning to the first team from injury, he lost his first team place to Antonee Robinson and was placed on the substitute bench. Taylor had to wait for two months to make his first team return, playing in the left\u2013midfield position, in a 2\u20130 win against Sunderland on 20 February 2018. Following this, he and Robinson competed in the left\u2013back position for the rest of the 2017\u201318 season. At times, Taylor appeared in the starting line\u2013up, where he captained the side on two occasions, which were against Leeds United and Birmingham City on 30 March 2018 and 3 April 2018 respectively. At the end of the 2017\u201318 season, Taylor made twenty\u2013one appearances in all competitions. He was also named the season's PFA Community Champion."]}, {"page": "List of United States men's international soccer players", "response": ["| Antonee Robinson || 19 || 1 || 2018\u2013", "| Antonee Robinson || 1 || 19", "| Antonee Robinson || 3 || 19 || 2018\u2013"]}, {"page": "List of Fulham F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["* Antonee Robinson"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Premier League players", "response": ["*Antonee Robinson \u2013 Fulham \u2013 2020\u201321"]}, {"page": "List of foreign EFL Championship players", "response": ["*Antonee Robinson \u2013 Bolton Wanderers, Wigan Athletic, Fulham 2017\u201320, 2021\u2013"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|15||Antonee Robinson||LB||||Milton Keynes||||34||0||Everton||6 August 2017||Loan||2018", "|15||||LB||Antonee Robinson                                     ||5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0||0", "| 4 August 2017 || LB ||  || Antonee Robinson || Everton || 30 June 2018 || "]}]}}
