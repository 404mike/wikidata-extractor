As a social reformer who was called the \"Poor Man's Earl\", he campaigned for better working conditions, reform to lunacy laws, education and the limitation of child labour. He was also an early supporter of the Zionist movement and the YMCA and a leading figure in the evangelical movement in the Church of England.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Labour law", "response": ["As England was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to face the often appalling consequences of the industrial revolution in a less regulated economic framework. Over the course of the late 18th and early to the mid-19th century the foundation for modern labour law was slowly laid, as some of the more egregious aspects of working conditions were steadily ameliorated through legislation.

Williams' idea grew out of meetings he held for prayer and Bible-reading among his fellow workers in a business in the city of London, and on 6 June 1844, he held the first meeting that led to the founding of YMCA with the purpose of \"the improving of the spiritual condition of young men engaged in the drapery, embroidery, and other trades.\"Report of the Thirteenth International Conference: xix Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury served as YMCA's first president from 1851 until his death in 1885."]}, {"page": "Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston", "response": ["In 1839, Palmerston married his mistress of many years, the noted Whig hostess Emily Lamb, widow of Peter Leopold Louis Francis Nassau Clavering-Cowper, 5th Earl Cowper (1778\u20131837) and sister of William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, prime minister (1834 and 1835\u20131841).

Although Britain forced Muhammad Ali to withdraw to Egypt, the Levant was left for a brief time without a government. The ongoing weakness of the Ottoman Empire made some in the west consider the potential of a Jewish state in the Holy Land. A number of important figures within the British government advocated such a plan, including Charles Henry Churchill.The Question of Palestine: British-Jewish-Arab Relations, 1914\u20131918, Isaiah.
