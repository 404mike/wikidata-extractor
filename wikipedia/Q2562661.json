Harvey was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions at the height of the Battle of Jutland. A long-serving Royal Marine officer descended of a military family, during his career Harvey became a specialist in naval artillery, serving on many large warships as gunnery training officer and gun commander. Specially requested for HMS Lion, the flagship of the British battlecruiser fleet, Harvey fought at the battles of Heligoland Bight, Dogger Bank and Jutland.\nAt Jutland, Harvey, although mortally wounded by German shellfire, ordered the magazine of Q turret on the battlecruiser Lion to be flooded. This action prevented the tons of cordite stored there from catastrophically detonating in an explosion that would have destroyed the vessel and all aboard her. Although he succumbed to his injuries seconds later, his dying act may have saved over a thousand lives and prompted Winston Churchill to later comment: \"In the long, rough, glorious history of the Royal Marines there is no name and no deed which in its character and consequences ranks above this\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Jutland", "response": ["The first near-kill of the Run to the South occurred at 16:00, when a  shell from L\u00fctzow wrecked the \"Q\" turret amidships on Beatty's flagship Lion.

Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, Von der Tann put another  shell on Indefatigables \"A\" turret forward. The plunging shells probably pierced the thin upper armour, and seconds later Indefatigable was ripped apart by another magazine explosion, sinking immediately with her crew of 1,019 officers and men, leaving only two survivors.

Eight minutes later, Lion scored the first hit on L\u00fctzow; a salvo from the British ship struck the battlecruiser on her forecastle, but no major damage was done. These two hits would prove to be very important, however, as L\u00fctzow took on more water due to damage sustained later in the battle, since they allowed water to enter the ship above the armored deck. Nearly simultaneously, L\u00fctzow dealt a tremendous blow to Lion; one of her 30.5\u00a0cm shells penetrated the roof of Lions center \"Q\" turret and detonated the munitions that were stored inside. Only by the resolute actions of the turret commander\u2014Major Francis Harvey, who ordered the magazine be flooded\u2014did the ship avoid a catastrophic magazine explosion. Indeed, approximately 30 minutes after the turret was destroyed, the fire in the turret spread to the working chamber that was directly above the magazine; there it detonated propellant charges that had been stored there. The resulting explosion would have likely destroyed the ship if the ammunition magazine had not been flooded."]}, {"page": "HMS Lion (1910)", "response": ["Lion served as the flagship of the Grand Fleet's battlecruisers throughout World War I, except when she was being refitted or under repair.Campbell, p. 29 She sank the German light cruiser  during the Battle of Heligoland Bight and served as Vice-Admiral David Beatty's flagship at the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland. She was so badly damaged at the first of these battles that she had to be towed back to port and was under repair for more than two months. During the Battle of Jutland she suffered a serious propellant fire that could have destroyed the ship had it not been for the bravery of Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey, the gun turret commander, who posthumously received the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded. The fire destroyed one gun turret which had to be removed for rebuilding while she was under repair for several months. She spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although she did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917. She was put into reserve in 1920 and sold for scrap in 1924 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.", "This began what was to be called the 'Run to the South' as Beatty changed course to steer east-south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed almost immediately afterwards by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, Lion and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. Lion, as the leading British ship, engaged , her opposite number in the German formation. L\u00fctzows fire was very accurate, and Lion was hit twice within three minutes of the Germans' opening fire. By 15:54 the range was down to , and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57.Tarrant, pp. 80\u201383 Lion scored her first hit on L\u00fctzow two minutes later, but L\u00fctzow returned the favour at 16:00 when one of her 305\u00a0mm shells hit 'Q' turret at a range of .Massie, p. 592 The shell penetrated the joint between the nine-inch turret faceplate and the 3.5-inch roof and detonated over the centre of the left-hand gun. It blew the front roof plate and the centre faceplate off the turret, killed or wounded everyone in the turret, and started a fire that smouldered, despite efforts to put it out that had been thought to have been successful. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the eight full propellant charges in the turret working room at 16:28. They burned violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and the magazine would probably have exploded if it had not already been flooded.Roberts, p. 116 Royal Marine Major Francis Harvey, the mortally wounded turret commander, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for having ordered the magazine flooded."]}, {"page": "Francis John William Harvey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Harvey"]}]}}
