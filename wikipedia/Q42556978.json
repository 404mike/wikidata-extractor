In 1979, he briefly returned to his earlier jazz roots recording the \"straight ahead jazz\" 2-CD offering, Nexus \u2013 For Duo & Trio, now considered by many a classic, at personal request of Clive Davis for former Arista/Bluebird/RCA Records, followed by occasional special recording projects such as duo recordings with Joe Sample and Oscar Castro-Neves. Following another of his sabbaticals he then, upon personal urging of legendary pop and rock music mogul Joe Smith, moved to Elektra Records, recording five albums. After another brief sabbatical he then returned to Verve/GRP for Universal Records where his primary vast catalog of recordings reside. Klemmer then took his longest and most controversial sabbatical, causing numerous false rumors of personal and health problems as he continued writing, recording and working with new digital technologies, plus returning to vocal studies with noted Macy Gray and Brandi vocal teacher, Roger Burnley. He then returned to recording as guest soloist with such New Age artists as 3rd Force, David Arkenstone, and Craig Chaquico, while also returning to his performing, touring and recording career."]}, {"page": "Burnley (surname)", "response": ["* Roger Burnley (born 1966), British businessman, CEO of Asda"]}, {"page": "Sean Clarke", "response": ["On 30 October 2017, it was announced that Roger Burnley would succeed him as CEO of Asda on 1 January 2018."]}, {"page": "2022 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Roger Burnley, Chief Executive, Asda Stores Ltd.
