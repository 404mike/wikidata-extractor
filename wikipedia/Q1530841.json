She again used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), an RNA virus. Her meeting with Aaron Klug in early 1954 led to a longstanding and successful collaboration. Klug had just then earned his PhD from Trinity College, Cambridge, and joined Birkbeck in late 1953. In 1955 Franklin published her first major works on TMV in Nature, in which she described that all TMV virus particles were of the same length. This was in direct contradiction to the ideas of the eminent virologist Norman Pirie, though her observation ultimately proved correct.Maddox, p. 252."]}, {"page": "Rothamsted Research", "response": ["*Norman Pirie"]}, {"page": "1907 in science", "response": ["* July 1 \u2013 Norman Pirie (died 1997), British virologist."]}, {"page": "1997 in science", "response": ["* March 29 \u2013 Norman Pirie (b. 1907), British virologist."]}, {"page": "Leaf protein concentrate", "response": ["LPC was first suggested as a human food in the 1960s, but it has not achieved much success, despite early promise. Norman Pirie (1971, 1975), the Copley Medal winner from the UK, reviewed and emphasized the importance of its benefits, which brought the subject forward. The increasing reliance on feedlot based animal rearing to satisfy human appetites for meat has increased demand for cheaper vegetable protein sources. This has recently led to renewed interest in LPC to reduce the use of human-edible vegetable protein sources in animal feed."]}]}}
