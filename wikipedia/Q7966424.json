The first board of arbitration was formed in connection with the iron trade of the north of England in March 1869, and Dale was its first president. The experiment was successful, serving to stabilise the industry's previously disorganised and volatile industrial relations. In recognition of Dale's services to the Iron Trades Conciliation Board he was publicly presented in 1881 with an address and a portrait painted by Walter William Ouless. Dale's important position within industry led to his appointment on several royal commissions, among which were those on trade depression (1885\u201386); on mining royalties (1889\u201393); and on labour (1891\u201394). At the Berlin labour conference of 1890, convened by the German emperor, he was one of the representatives of Great Britain, and during the sittings he received marked attention from the emperor and Bismarck. He helped to found the Iron and Steel Institute in 1869, and acted as honorary treasurer from that date until 1895, when he was elected president."]}, {"page": "List of Royal Academicians", "response": ["| Walter William Ouless   ||align=\"center\" |  1881  || "]}]}}
