He first played for Oxford University Cricket Club in 1897; in addition to cricket, he also represented Oxford at football, racquets and golf. However, although he did fairly well, it was not until 1899 that his beautiful and immaculate driving to the off-side made him into one of the finest batsmen of his time. He had played for Worcestershire while they were still a minor county but in 1899, their inaugural season as a first-class county, he and his brother Wilfrid Foster both scored two hundreds in a match (against Hampshire), a feat which remains unique in county cricket. In 1900, as captain of Oxford, he scored 171 to set the record for the highest individual score in the Varsity Match, and he scored 102 not out and 136 for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, the first man to score two centuries in a match in the Gentleman v Players series. In total, Foster scored 930 runs at an average of 77.5 for Oxford in the 1900 season, a record in University cricket."]}, {"page": "Fostershire", "response": ["| Wilfrid Foster"]}, {"page": "Frederick Bowley (cricketer, born 1873)", "response": ["Having appeared for Worcestershire on a number of occasions before its elevation to the County Championship, Bowley made his first-class debut in Worcestershire's second match at that level, against Sussex at Hove in mid-May 1899.
