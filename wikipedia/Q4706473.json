However, her agent notified Myles of the role and Myles' was keen to audition for the series due to its reputation and Eccleston being \"one of my favourite actors of all time\". After inadvertently attending the audition in a T-shirt emblazoned with an image of two naked women kissing under the slogan \"I support Nudist Colonies\", Myles was convinced she had not got the part; her appearance contrasted grossly with Gwyneth's personality. After being notified of her success Myles did not want to prioritise between her theatre commitments and Doctor Who; her agent decided that she would appear in the episode. Russell T Davies was enamoured by her performance, which he felt confirmed that the actress was \"one of Wales's best-kept secrets\", and subsequently wrote her a lead role in the Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood. Myles' Torchwood character Gwen Cooper is intimated to be related to Gwyneth in \"Journey's End\"  after the Doctor asks Gwen about her family history.Burk and Smith? p. 15 Alan David was cast as Mr Sneed; Gatiss was pleased with the casting, as he had grown up watching David."]}, {"page": "Shoestring (TV series)", "response": ["* Alan David as Dr. Ben Fischer (two episodes)"]}, {"page": "The Green Green Grass", "response": ["| Alan David || Llewellyn Ap Caradog || colspan=\"4\"  || 15", "Llewellyn (Alan David) \u2013 Llewellyn is Boycie's next-door neighbour.
