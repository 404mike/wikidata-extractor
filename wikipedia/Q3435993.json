These protestations reflected Markham's protective attitude towards Scott; according to Bruce, \"Scott was Markham's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and Markham thought it necessary, in order to uphold Scott, that I should be obliterated\". He added that \"Scott and I were always good friends, in spite of Markham.\" Markham's writings on naval history have been criticised by modern scholars due to his nationalistic exaggeration of English sailors' achievements in the Age of Discoveries."]}, {"page": "Laurie Island", "response": ["In January 1904, Bruce offered control of Omond House to the government of Argentina; the house would later be renamed Orcadas Base. The British Government had previously refused to carry on the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition's scientific studies, as they considered Laurie Island itself worthless. The expedition lacked the necessary mandate to claim the island for either Britain or Scotland.  Nevertheless, Bruce's offer was accepted, and the Argentines would continue operating the meteorological station at Omond House, sending a ship each year to replenish supplies. Laurie Island would prove politically valuable to Argentina. To justify its claim to a sector of Antarctica, Argentina argued that its permanent settlement on the island demonstrated sovereignty, a key to securing a claim over a mostly desolate area. Robert Rudmose-Brown, who participated in Bruce's expedition, expressed a different view. He argued in a 1947 article that no country had the capability to govern a region as vast as Antarctica and thus no country had the standing to claim Antarctica as its own."]}, {"page": "Scottish National Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["The expedition's scientific staff consisted of six persons, including Bruce. The zoologist was David Wilton who, like Bruce, had been a member of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition. He had acquired skiing and sledging skills during several years living in northern Russia. Robert Rudmose-Brown, of University College, Dundee, and formerly an assistant in the Botany Department at the British Museum, was the party's botanist. Dr James Harvie Pirie, who had worked in the Challenger office under John Murray, was geologist, bacteriologist, and the expedition's medical officer. Robert Mossman directed meteorological and magnetic work, and Alastair Ross, a medical student, was taxidermist."]}, {"page": "Robert Neal Rudmose-Brown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rudmose-Brown"]}, {"page": "R.N.R.Br.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rudmose-Brown"]}, {"page": "Robert Rudmose Brown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rudmose-Brown"]}, {"page": "Robert Neal Rudmose Brown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rudmose-Brown"]}, {"page": "Rudmose-Brown, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Rudmose-Brown"]}]}}
