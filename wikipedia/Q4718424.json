He was Henry Duncan prize lecturer in Scottish Studies, Royal Society of Edinburgh (1990\u20131993), and has been a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh since 1991.

Since demitting his professorship of logic and rhetoric at Glasgow University (held from 1994 to 2009) he has been honorary professorial research fellow there, mainly researching 17th-century Scottish philosophy.\nIn 2007 Broadie was awarded the degree of DUniv honoris causa by Blaise Pascal University at Clermont-Ferrand in recognition of his contribution to Franco-Scottish collaboration in the field of the history of philosophy.\nBroadie's A History of Scottish Philosophy (2009) was named Saltire Society Scottish History Book of the Year. In July 2018 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Eighteenth-Century Scottish Studies Society, and in 2020 was appointed honorary vice-president of the Saltire Society in recognition of his contribution to Scottish philosophy.\nDuring the past decade Broadie has been active in several international networks. His roles have included: Principal Investigator, International Network: 'Scottish philosophy and philosophers in seventeenth-century Scotland and France' (2010-2014), funded by the Leverhulme Trust; and Co-Investigator (with Dr Ramona Fotiade), International Research Network: 'Existential Philosophy and Literature: The Franco-Scottish Connection - Past and Present' (2017-2019), funded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

H. Burns, by 1506 Cranston was \"a prominent member of the circle around Mair\", who together played a large part in reviving scholastic philosophy in the early 16th century. As Alexander Broadie put it, \"Cranston was in many ways close to Mair, particularly in respect to their deep commitment to the scholastic tradition in logic and theology.\" Cranston was a diligent defender of scholastic philosophy against the criticism of humanist philosophers. In 1510, Mair published (and wrote down) a dialogue between Cranston and the young aristocrat and poet Gavin Douglas, in which Cranston gives a potent defense of Mair's scholasticism against the humanist scepticism of Douglas. But, like his teacher, Cranston maintained an open mind around humanism. Both were happy to attend humanist scholar Girolamo Aleandro's lectures on Ancient Greek at the University, which introduced the language to the Paris; Aleandro later credited Cranston among his \"most faithful auditors\" and \"illustrious friends\" in France."]}]}}
