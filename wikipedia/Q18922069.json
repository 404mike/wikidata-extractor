Calling for a negotiated peace, the group attempted to march on the Cenotaph in 1942 but the demonstration was banned by the authorities and the group came under suspicion. The BNP, which emphasised anti-Semitism, initially gained some support and not long after its foundation claimed to have 50 branches across the country.D. Renton, Fascism, Anti-Fascism and Britain in the 1940s, Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000, p.25 It also enjoyed the support of a number of right-wing journals, such as those of Captain Bernard Acworth and Joseph Ball, as well as the backing of the British League of Ex-Servicemen and Women, a group that had been associated with the BUF and which was later taken over by Jeffrey Hamm. William Craven, a farm worker from Gloucester who was sentenced to life imprisonment for twice writing to government agencies of Nazi Germany to offer his services, was also a BNP member following his expulsion from the BUF for extremism.Sean Murphy, Letting the Side Down: British Traitors of the Second World War, Stroud, 2006, pp. 32-3"]}, {"page": "Henry Drummond Wolff (Basingstoke MP)", "response": ["Such was the notoriety of Drummond Wolff with regards to his support for Nazism that he was used as an unofficial intermediary with Nazi Germany during the late 1930s. He was one of a number of leading British figures who regularly visited Germany in 1939 to hold talks with representatives of the Nazi government in an effort to avert war. Officially, such talks were not sanctioned by the government but in fact they were generally arranged with the support of Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, his Undersecretary R.A. Butler, or even Neville Chamberlain himself.Pugh, p. 282 In 1939, Conservative Central Office operative and former MI5 spy, Sir Joseph Ball, acting on behalf of Chamberlain, facilitated four lengthy visits to Germany by Drummond Wolff, who undertook negotiations with Helmuth Wohlthat and Walther Hewel, political advisers to Hermann G\u00f6ring and Adolf Hitler respectively, amongst others.Pugh, p. 283 In the last of those trips, Drummond Wolff even held talks with G\u00f6ring himself. However, the meeting accomplished little because, by that point, Drummond Wolff was so pro-Nazi that he would agree with the Nazi view and simply present it to the government, rather than suggesting compromises. A leading industrialist, his visits to Germany were excused as being on behalf of the Council of Empire Industries Association, of which Drummond Wolff was a leading member.Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: The Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938-1939, Random House, 1989, p. 396 In 1934, he had become a member of the committee of the group which sought to promote trade between the countries within the British Commonwealth and the British Empire, .Newton, p. 151"]}, {"page": "Sir George Joseph Ball", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Ball (British public servant)"]}, {"page": "Joseph Ball (barrister)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Ball (British public servant)"]}, {"page": "George Joseph Ball", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Ball (British public servant)"]}, {"page": "Antisemitism in the UK Conservative Party", "response": ["Conservative leader and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain had a dislike for the Jews.Klaus P.

Both Truth and Chamberlain accused people who questioned Chamberlain's attempts at appeasement with Nazi Germany of being 'unEnglish', 'Jewish/Communist traitor[s] of the true English cause', or having been misled by 'Jewish-Communist propaganda'.
