From the 1940s the view of Hearst and Morgan's most important joint creation as the phantasmagorical Xanadu of Orson Welles's imagination has been commonplace. Although some literary depictions were gently mocking; P. G. Wodehouse's novel of 1953, The Return of Jeeves has a character describe her stay, \"I remember visiting San Simeon once, and there was a whole French Abbey lying on the grass\"; others were not. John Steinbeck's unnamed description was certainly of Hearst; \"They's a fella, newspaper fella near the coast, got a million acres. Fat, sof' fella with little mean eyes an' a mouth like a ass-hole\". The writer John Dos Passos went further, explicitly referencing Hearst in the third volume of his 1938 U.S.A trilogy. \"The emperor of newsprint retired to his fief of San Simeon where he built an Andalusian palace and there spends his last years amid the relaxing adulations of screenstars, admen, screenwriters, publicity-men, columnists, Until he dies, a spent Caesar grown old with spending.\" The English architectural writer Clive Aslet was little more complimentary about the castle. Disliking its \"unsympathetic texture (of) poured concrete\", he described it as \"best seen from a distance\". The unfinished, and unresolved, rear fa\u00e7ade of Casa Grande has been the subject of particular negative comment; Carleton Winslow and Nicola Frye, in their history from 1980, suggest the flanking North and South wings \"compete rather disastrously\" with the central doge's suite block. Others questioned the castle's very existence; the architect Witold Rybczynski asking, \"what is this Italian villa doing on the Californian Coastal Range? ... a costly piece of theatrical d\u00e9cor that ignores its context (and) lacks meaning\". Hearst's collections were similarly disparaged, the art historian William George Constable echoed Joseph Duveen when he assessed Hearst as \"not a collector but a gigantic and voracious magpie\"."]}, {"page": "Reculver", "response": ["A byname for the towers is the \"Twin Sisters\", and an account of how this first arose was current about a hundred years after its supposed happening in the late 15th century, but in its usual form, for example in a 19th-century travel guide, it is mostly an invention created around \"pseudo-historical detail\".; . The Ingoldsby Legends includes a re-invention of the story in which two brothers, Robert and Richard de Birchington, are substituted for the two sisters.

Its chief fault is the lack of harmony between Humbert's original building and Edis's extensions, \"a contrast between the northern and southern halves of the house (that) has been much criticised ever since\". The architectural historian John Martin Robinson wrote in 1982, \"Sandringham, the latest in date of the houses of the British monarchy, is the least distinguished architecturally\". In his biography of Queen Mary, James Pope-Hennessy compared the house unfavourably to \"a golf-hotel at St Andrews or a station-hotel at Strathpeffer\". Simon Jenkins considered Sandringham \"unattractive\", with a \"grim, institutional appearance\". Pevsner described the architectural style as \"frenetic\"; Girouard expressed himself perplexed as to the preference shown by the royal family for A. J. Humbert, a patronage the writer Adrian Tinniswood described as \"the Victorian Royal Family's knack for choosing second-rate architects\". An article on the house in the June 1902 edition of Country Life opined, \"of mere splendour there is not much, but of substantial comfort a good deal\".

He spent around \u00a3250,000 on repairs, reconstruction, refurbishment, and furnishings between 1925 and 1937, renovating the castle with architectural trophies from across the United Kingdom and abroad; at the peak of his buying, Hearst's expenditure reportedly accounted for a quarter of the world's entire art market. Alice Head, manager of Hearst's London operations and the actual purchaser of St Donat's, recorded her exhilaration: \"We were on top of the wave \u2013 out of (one) year's profits, we bought The Connoisseur, we bought St Donat's and we bought vast quantities of antiques.\" The writer Clive Aslet described Hearst's passion for antiquities as \"naked obsession... romance gave way to rape\", and his mania for collecting was satirised in Orson Welles's 1941 film Citizen Kane. Kane's palace Xanadu, modelled on San Simeon, is described as containing \"A collection of everything, so big that it can never be catalogued or appraised. Enough for ten museums, the loot of the world.\" Hearst's actions were vigorously opposed, particularly in relation to the destruction of the Augustinian foundation Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire. Built in 1142, by the 20th century the priory was in poor repair. Hearst purchased the site in 1929, under conditions of secrecy, and had workmen take down the cloister, tithe barn, prior's lodging and refectory. Parts were shipped to California; major elements were incorporated into St Donat's as part of the newly created Bradenstoke Hall; while other pieces, including the tithe barn, were lost. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings ran a poster campaign on the London Underground, using text that was considered libellous and which had to be pasted over. The campaign also saw questions on the issue being raised in Parliament. Hearst was unconcerned, Miss Head responding to the SPAB secretary: \"Mr Hearst and I are well aware of your views.

This can be seen in older upscale neighbourhoods where the lots are sufficiently large to allow the house to have an individual presence, despite variations in the style of neighboring houses. Whether of older or recent origin, the appearance of solid beams and half timbered exterior walls is only superficial. Artificially aged and blackened beams are constructed from light wood, bear no loads, and are attached to ceilings and walls purely for decoration, while artificial flames leap from wrought iron fire-dogs in an inglenook often a third of the size of the room in which they are situated. Occasionally, owners sought to replicate more closely the conditions of Tudor living; an example were the Moynes at Baliffscourt in West Sussex, a house which Clive Aslet describes as \"the most extreme - and most successful - of all Tudor taste country houses\". Lord Moyne's wife, Evelyn, a society hostess, employed the amateur architect Amyas Philips to create a house inspired by the medieval Baliffscourt Chapel which stood on the site. The cloister-like design required visitors to leave the house and access their bedrooms via external staircases. Chips Channon, the diarist and politician described the bedrooms themselves as \"decorated to resemble the cell of a rather 'pansy' monk\". The novelist E. F. Benson satirised the style in his book Queen Lucia; \"the famous smoking-parlour, with rushes on the floor, a dresser ranged with pewter tankards, and leaded lattice-windows of glass so antique that it was practically impossible to see out of them...sconces on the walls held dim iron lamps, so that only those of the most acute vision were able to read\"."]}, {"page": "Peak Literary Festival", "response": ["Previous festival authors included Clare Short, Tariq Ali, Matthew Parris, Gervase Phinn, Brian Turner, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, Clive Aslet (Country Life editor), James Geary (editor of Time Magazine), Roger Protz (editor of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), Jane Fearnley Whittingstall, Colin Tudge, David Rothenberg, David and Ben Crystal, Martin Gurdon, Mark Gwynne Jones, E.

A note by Simpson claimed exclusive credit, suggesting that Burnet and Tait merely approved the final design; but Burnet and Tait exhibited the design as a joint work with Simpson at the Royal Academy; and drawings held at London Metropolitan Archives are signed by Burnet and Tait alone. Burnet was on the point of retiring owing to ill health; while Tait was a leading proponent of modern architecture, little of which is evident in the final design. The conclusion of Clive Aslet is that Lomax-Simpson was responsible for the overall concept (an early drawing by him dated October 1929 depicts the frontage very much as built); while Burnet and Tait were invited to become involved because of the prestige of their practice's name, but contributed only details.Aslet 1981."]}, {"page": "Giles Worsley", "response": ["Worsley joined Country Life weekly magazine in 1985 as an architectural writer, working for Clive Aslet and Marcus Binney, becoming architectural editor in 1989.
