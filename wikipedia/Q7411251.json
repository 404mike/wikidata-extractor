He was the leading painter of actors and actresses between 1770 and 1820. He lived in Clarendon Square, Somers Town.De Wilde was baptised in London on 28 July 1751, the son of a Dutch joiner who had settled there by 1748. He was apprenticed to his godfather, Samuel Haworth, a joiner in London, but left after five years and enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools from 1769. He exhibited small portraits at the Society of Artists (1776\u20131778) and at the Royal Academy (from 1778). His career in theatrical portraiture began when he was employed by John Bell as portraitist for his publication British Theatre, a series that ran from 1791 until 1795. He became well known for his theatrical portraiture, which he exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1792 until 1821.  At his studio in Drury Lane many actors and actresses came to sit for him and his theatrical portraits appeared in numerous publications, including the Monthly Mirror, John Cawthorn's Minor British Theatre and William Oxberry's New English Drama. The bulk of his work is in pencil or watercolour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somers Town, London", "response": ["* Samuel De Wilde (1751\u20131832), portrait painter and etcher, lived in Clarendon Square"]}, {"page": "Miser", "response": ["The popularity of these theatrical misers is evident from the number of paintings and drawings based on them, many of which were then adapted as prints. In 18th-century England, it was Fielding's \"The Miser\" that attracted most attention. Samuel Wale's drawing of the second act was also made into a print. But it was principally depictions of various actors in the character of Lovegold, the play's anti-hero, which attracted artists.  Samuel De Wilde pictured William Farren in the role at the Theatre Royal, Bath. Several other works became plates in one or another book dedicated to English drama. James Roberts II  (1753 \u2013 c. 1810) executed a pen and ink watercolour of Edward Shuter in character which was adapted as a print for the six-volume play collection, Bell's British Theatre. Charles Reuben Ryley made a print of Thomas Ryder in the role for Lowndes' British Theatre (1788), while  Thomas Parkinson's painting of Richard Yates as Lovegold was adapted for the 1776 edition of that work. In the following century, Thomas Charles Wageman's dramatic head and shoulders drawing of William Farren as Lovegold illustrated William Oxberry's collection of texts, The New English Drama (1820). From this time too dates the coloured print of Samuel Vale acting the part of Goliah Spiderlimb, the comic servant in Jerrold's The Smoked Miser."]}, {"page": "Garrick Club", "response": ["The collection originated with the actor Charles Mathews, one of the original members of the club who had a passion for collecting theatrical portraits; they were once displayed by him in a gallery at his home, Ivy Cottage, in Highgate, north London. Mathews managed to secure a large number of pictures from the collection of Thomas Harris, who had been manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and which included paintings by the likes of Johann Zoffany, Francis Hayman and Gainsborough Dupont. He also actively commissioned artists such as Samuel De Wilde to paint all the popular stars of the stage at that time (there are 196 works by De Wilde in the collection).
