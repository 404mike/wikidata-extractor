Her works include Guardians of the Tall Stones and The Egyptian Sequence.\nShe was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and moved to London in 1951. She married Oliver Caldecott and raised three children. She had degrees in English and Philosophy and an M.A. in English Literature.\nIn 2000, she became one of the earliest proponents of commercial e-books when she contracted with Mushroom eBooks to re-publish most of her titles in electronic formats.\nShe had a reputation as a novelist who wrote as vividly about the adventures and experiences to be encountered in the inner realms of the human consciousness as she did about those in the outer physical world. To Moyra, reality was multidimensional.\nIn her later years she suffered from progressive aphasia. She died peacefully on 23 May 2015, aged 87.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bath, Somerset", "response": ["Taking the waters is described in Charles Dickens' novel The Pickwick Papers in which Pickwick's servant, Sam Weller, comments that the water has \"a very strong flavour o' warm flat irons\".
