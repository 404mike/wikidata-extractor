Bedser, Compton, Edrich, Hutton, Wright and Yardley from the 1947 series all declined the tour before the squad was selected, as did Trevor Bailey who was in contention for a place. With Yardley missing, MCC reappointed pre-war captain Gubby Allen to lead the party but he was the first in a spate of injuries when he damaged a leg muscle on the outward voyage. Following further injuries to Dennis Brookes and Joe Hardstaff junior, Allen asked MCC to send reinforcements and Hutton then changed his mind, flying out just in time to play against British Guiana.", "Of the players who went to the West Indies, the only ones who had played against South Africa in the summer were Hutton, Evans, Cranston, Robertson, Howorth and Butler. Hardstaff and Ikin had been to Australia and New Zealand the previous winter. The other eight were Allen and seven newcomers: Dennis Brookes, Billy Griffith, Jim Laker, Winston Place, Gerald Smithson, Maurice Tremlett and Johnny Wardle. Playfair was disappointed with the situation in the West Indies, especially as England were well beaten in the Test series. The team, it said, \"could not be called great by any standards\" as it was too \"experimental\" but it at least seemed \"workmanlike\" and in Laker a new star had been discovered.Playfair, p. 11. Playfair ominously concluded its review by reference to the 1948 Australian team being \"about to descend upon us well armed in all key departments (and) we shall have to do better than this\".Playfair, p. 13.", "Northamptonshire slipped from sixteenth to bottom and were captained by Arthur Childs-Clarke. Dennis Brookes was the pick of the batsmen and earned a trip to the West Indies in the winter. Bill Barron, Percy Davis and John Timms also topped 1,000 runs but with low averages. Vince Broderick put in a sound all-round effort with 860 runs and 87 wickets while the best bowler was West Indian Test player Bertie Clarke with 89 wickets. The attack was hampered by injuries to Nobby Clark who did not play often. Wicketkeeper Kenneth Fiddling claimed 40 victims.

MCC won by 163 runs. The MCC team in batting order was Dennis Brookes (Northamptonshire), Jack Robertson (Middlesex), Bob Wyatt (Worcestershire), Denis Compton (Middlesex), Bryan Valentine (Kent, captain), Leslie Compton (Middlesex, wicketkeeper), Wilf Wooller (Glamorgan), Haydn Davies (Glamorgan), Jack Young (Middlesex), Rowland Shaddick (Middlesex) and Jack Martin (Kent). MCC won the toss and chose to bat first but were bowled out in 57 overs for 134, Denis Compton making 73. Yorkshire got off to a very bad start when Len Hutton was dismissed by Jack Martin for nought. This began an outstanding spell for Martin who finished with six for 23 from 12.1 overs as Yorkshire collapsed to 81 all out. At close of play on the Saturday, MCC were 67 for one with Jack Robertson 36 not out. On the Monday, Robertson built a big innings and scored 164 of a declared total of 343 for 9. Yorkshire's hopes slumped when Hutton was again dismissed cheaply and at close of play they were 69 for two. Vic Wilson tried his best and scored 74, which was his highest career score to date, but Jack Young was in fine form and took six for 85 to win the match for MCC.CricketArchive \u2013 MCC v Yorkshire 1947.

In May 1947 he was picked for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team to play the touring South African team and scored 80 and 25, sharing in a first-innings first-wicket partnership of 121 with Dennis Brookes which accounted for more than half of the MCC total. Less than two weeks later, he made 157, which remained his highest ever individual score, in the match against Leicestershire at Leicester. And when the first-class averages were published early in June, Dodds stood fourth in the national batting lists with 816 runs at an average of 51 runs per innings, headed only by the Test players Martin Donnelly, Denis Compton and Len Hutton. These averages were published while the first Test match against the South Africans was being played: Dodds was not picked for that, nor for any Test cricket. He maintained form to the end of the 1947 season, and his aggregate of 2147 runs at an average of 38.33 was his highest total for a single season. The 1948 season was another success for Dodds: he scored 1876 runs at an average of 39.08, his best season's average, though on both aggregate and average he was outshone by his opening partner, Avery.", "Dodds' first-class cricket career never achieved these heights again, and though he continued to contribute more than 1000 runs each season for the next 10 years, his batting average drifted downwards \u2013 to the low 30s up to 1952, and then the mid 20s thereafter. His cavalier batting style rarely led to long innings and he never scored more than three centuries in any single season; after 1954, he made only one further century in four-and-a-half years of regular county cricket. He was, according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002, \"like a fiery Viking, smiting and walloping in the Essex cause\". In the wet 1958 season his aggregate was just 1075 runs and his average had declined to 21.93; he was, with Dennis Brookes and Jack Robertson, by this stage one of only three cricketers to have achieved 1000 runs in each postwar season. In the 1959 season, the young opening batsman Les Savill enjoyed a highly successful start to the season and Dodds dropped out of the Essex first team in mid-season. After a few second eleven games, he did not regain his place and he retired from regular cricket at the end of the season. He reappeared in single matches for MCC in both 1960 and 1961, in the first of these scoring 75 and 41 against Cambridge University and sharing a fast opening partnership of 100 with Tom Pugh that lasted just an hour."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Dennis Brookes (1947\u20131947/48) : D.
