He succeeded his father as MP for Newcastle in 1798, holding the seat until 1812. From 1820 until his death he was the MP for Northumberland.He became a lieutenant of the Northumberland militia in 1790, being promoted captain in 1793, and in 1819 he was made Lieutenant-Colonel of the Northumberland & Newcastle volunteer cavalry.  \nHis father installed him at Middleton Lodge, about 4 miles south of Leeds, in 1802. The family had come into ownership of land here through marriage of Ralph Brandling, Charles John's great great uncle, to the Middleton heiress in 1697. Charles John commissioned a survey of the estate and its potential and appointed John Blenkinsop as his manager. This young mining engineer was responsible for making a success of the next era of the mining business by inventing a rack and pinion system for the wagonway (a horse-drawn route of the mid-18th century) and commissioning what turned out to be the first commercially successful steam locomotive, designed and built by Matthew Murray, to transport the coals into Leeds on The Middleton Railway.\nHe married Frances Elizabeth Hawksworth, daughter of Walter Fawkes (formerly Hawksworth) of Hawksworth, Yorks.  His friend Earl Grey described him and his wife as \"cordial in their manner, unaffected and extremely good-natured\".  They had no children.\nIn 1817 he chaired the committee which established the reward to be paid to George Stephenson for the invention of the Geordie lamp.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Middleton, Leeds", "response": ["The Middleton Railway, founded in 1758, is the oldest continuously working railway in Britain to be established by an Act of Parliament; the first such act in England. The railway, owned by Charles Brandling, (1733\u20131802) was a horse drawn wooden waggonway linking the collieries at Middleton to Cassons Close near Leeds Bridge in the centre of Leeds. In 1810 John Blenkinsop, Brandling's agent at Middleton, was looking for cheaper ways of moving coal to Leeds. He designed the rack railway and Matthew Murray built the first Middleton Railway locomotive, \"Salamanca\", at his Round Foundry in Holbeck. The locomotive's first run, reported in The Leeds Mercury on 27 June 1812, was \"witnessed by thousands of spectators and crowned a complete success....\". Three more locomotives were built. The Middleton Railway locomotives had a toothed cog wheel which meshed into a rack on the side of the rail, as it was felt this would provide the engines with a better grip when hauling coal wagons."]}, {"page": "Brandling of Newcastle", "response": ["Charles Brandling (1733\u20131802) was High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1781 and was Member of Parliament for Newcastle 1784\u20131798.
