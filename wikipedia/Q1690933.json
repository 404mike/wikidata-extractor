He wrote a treatise on medicine titled Rosa Medicinae (The Rose of Medicine), also called Rosa Anglica (\"The English Rose\"), between 1304 and 1317, considered to be the first English textbook of medicine. John of Gaddesden was also a Roman Catholic theologian, a fellow at Merton College, Oxford, a physician for members of the British royal family, and one of the most celebrated medical authorities of his time. His medical works, alongside those of Gilbertus Anglicus, \"formed part of the core curriculum that underpinned the practice of medicine for the next 400 years\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Berkhamsted", "response": ["In 1400, Henry IV lived in the castle after he deposed Richard, and he used the castle to imprison others attempting to obtain the throne. During this time, Geoffrey Chaucer \u2013 later famous for writing The Canterbury Tales \u2013 oversaw renovation work on the castle in his role as Clerk of the Works at Berkhamsted. It is unknown how much time he spent at Berkhamsted, but he knew John of Gaddesden, who lived in nearby Little Gaddesden and was the model for the Doctor of Phisick in The Canterbury Tales. Henry V and Henry VI owned the castle, the latter making use of it until he was overthrown in 1461. In 1469, Edward IV gave the castle to his mother, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York. The arrival of Neville and her household  at Berkhamsted had a significant social and financial impact on the town. Men and women from the town joined her service, such as Robert Incent who became her secretary and whose memorial brass can still be seen in St Peter\u2019s Church in Berkhamsted.  Mother to both Edward IV and Richard III, grandmother to Edward V, and mother in law to Henry VII, she was the last person to live in the castle.", "Geoffrey Chaucer was clerk of works at Berkhamsted Castle from 1389 and based his Doctor of Phisick in The Canterbury Tales on John of Gaddesden, who lived in nearby Little Gaddesden. William Cowper was born in Berkhamsted Rectory in 1731. Although he moved away when still a boy, there are frequent references to the town in his poems and letters. In the Victorian era, Cowper became a cult figure and Berkhamsted was a place of pilgrimage for his devotees. Maria Edgeworth, a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults' and children's literature who was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe, lived in Berkhamsted as a child in the 18th century. Between 1904 and 1907, the Llewelyn Davies boys were the inspiration for the author and playwright J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. A little later, novelist Graham Greene was born in Berkhamsted and educated at Berkhamsted School, alongside literary contemporaries Claud Cockburn, Peter Quennell, Humphrey Trevelyan and Cecil Parrott. Children's authors H. E. Todd and Hilda van Stockum both lived in Berkhamsted. The comic character Ed Reardon from Radio 4's semi-naturalistic radio drama Ed Reardon's Week resides in Berkhamsted."]}, {"page": "14th century in literature", "response": ["**John of Gaddesden \u2013 Rosa Medicin\u00e6"]}, {"page": "15th century in literature", "response": ["**John of Gaddesden \u2013 Rosa Medicin\u00e6 (first printing; written 1307)"]}, {"page": "Star jelly", "response": ["There have been reports of 'star-jelly' for centuries.Fort, C. \"The Book of the Damned\" pp41-50, 1919 John of Gaddesden (1280\u20131361)Gordon, p. 467 mentions stella terrae (Latin for 'star of the earth' or 'earth-star') in his medical writings, describing it as \"a certain mucilaginous substance lying upon the earth\" and suggesting that it might be used to treat abscesses.\"stella terre, que est quedam mucillago jacens super terram, prohibet apostemata calida in principio\", from John of Gaddesden, \"Rosa Medicinae\" or \"Rosa Anglica\", Venice edition of 1502, folio 28.
