The Redcliffe-Maud Report proposed the creation of eight provinces in England, which would see power devolved from central government.

In England, the majority of the Commission \"suggested regional coordinating and advisory councils for England, consisting largely of indirectly elected representatives of local authorities and operating along the lines of the Welsh advisory council\". One-fifth of the advisory councils would be nominees from central government.

It bases taxes to pay for public-goods expenditures on a politically-revealed willingness to pay for benefits received. The principle is sometimes likened to the function of prices in allocating private goods.Fritz Neumark and Charles E. McLure, Jr., 2013. \"Taxation,\" The Benefit Principle, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica,  preview.
