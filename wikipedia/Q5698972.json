Three girls on the edge of womanhood, a world on the brink of change.\" Despite high ratings of 4.5\u20135 million viewers and being The Sunday Times Pick of the Week for eight weeks in a row, Lilies was not recommissioned for a second series.", "Heidi Thomas first developed the idea for Lilies from listening to her grandmother's stories about growing up in post-World War I Liverpool. The Moss sisters are loosely based on her grandmother and her three sisters. Some aspects of the series, such as the grave fund that the girls save for, are taken directly from their lives. Thomas wrote the first complete draft of the script in 1996, but it was almost ten years before it was optioned by the BBC. During that time she lost the script, and had to recreate it from an old copy she found in her attic. Thomas elected to insert certain elements into the script to give the series a sense of realism, such as the slaughter of animals in the Moss home. A variety of actors were cast in Lilies, including native Liverpudlian Kerrie Hayes in her acting debut."]}]}}
