In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater\u2014Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did you put it in a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?\u2014Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian\u2014I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did\u2014There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing."]}, {"page": "William Morris", "response": ["Wightwick Manor in the West Midlands, England, is a notable example of the Morris & Co. style, with lots of original Morris wallpapers, fabrics, carpets, and furniture, May Morris art and embroidery, De Morgan tiles, and Pre-Raphaelite works of art, managed by the National Trust.

Edward Linley Sambourne's Man is But a Worm, drawn for Punch's Almanack, mocked the idea of any evolutionary link between humans and animals, with a sequence from chaos to earthworm to apes, primitive men, a Victorian beau, and Darwin in a pose that according to Tucker recalls Michelangelo's figure of Adam in his fresco adorning the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This was followed by a flood of variations on the evolution-as-progress theme, including The New Yorker's 1925 \"The Rise and Fall of Man\", the sequence running from a chimpanzee to Neanderthal man, Socrates, and finally the lawyer William Jennings Bryan who argued for the anti-evolutionist prosecution in the Scopes Trial on the State of Tennessee law limiting the teaching of evolution.  Tucker noted that Rudolph Franz Zallinger's 1965 \"The Road to Homo Sapiens\" fold-out illustration in F. Clark Howell's Early Man, showing a sequence of 14 walking figures ending with modern man, fitted the palaeoanthropological discoveries \"not into a branching Darwinian scheme, but into the framework of the original Huxley diagram.\" Howell ruefully commented that the \"powerful and emotional\" graphic had overwhelmed his Darwinian text."]}, {"page": "List of museums in London", "response": ["| 125px || Holland Park ||Kensington and Chelsea || West || Historic house || Also known as Linley Sambourne House, home of the Victorian Punch cartoonist Edward Linley Sambourne, features much of his work"]}, {"page": "Bernard Partridge", "response": ["In 1891 Partridge joined the staff of Punch  and, in 1910, became its chief cartoonist, replacing Edward Linley Sambourne.
