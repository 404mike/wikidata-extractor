The division was deployed to Palestine on internal security duties as part of a build-up of 18,500 men in the region. This force then began to suppress the revolt. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerrillas had overrun the Old City of Jerusalem. O'Connor's men proceeded to sweep the area, declaring the Old City free of militants on 19 October. The same day, the division seized Acre and by the end of the month were clearing Jaffa of rebels. Many Palestinians were detained and rebel activity significantly dropped off in the area. In the north, the 8th Infantry Division, under Major-General Bernard Montgomery, and Special Night Squads engaged in counter-terror operations, with O'Connor writing that one brigadier \"always encouraged his men to be brutal\". General Officer Commanding British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan Robert Haining wrote in late 1938 that \"unnecessary violence, vindictiveness ..., [and] killing in cold blood\" had to be curbed. O'Connor was likewise opposed to the measures in the north, and wrote \"harshness and unnecessary violence on the part of our soldiers\" had to be curbed. During the operation in Jerusalem, only four to nineteen guerrillas were killed.
