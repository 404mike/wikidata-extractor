From 1813 to 1819 he was the agent for his brother-in-law's estates and lived at T\u0177 Gwyn, Llanbeblig. Around 1821, under the pseudonym of \"Nimrod\", Apperley began to contribute a series of articles to The Sporting Magazine that covered horse races, hunt meets and other sporting events. His references to the personalities of the people he knew or met at such events helped to double the circulation of the magazine within a few years. Mr. Pittman, the proprietor of The Sporting Magazine, gave Nimrod a handsome salary and defrayed all the expenses of his tours. He also gave Nimrod a stud of hunters. After Pittman's death, the proprietors of the magazine sued Apperley for the money that had been advanced. To avoid imprisonment, Apperley moved to Calais in 1830, where he supported himself by writing.Welsh Biography Online Apperley is best known for the two books, The Life of a Sportsman, and Memoirs of the Life of John Mytton, both of which were illustrated with coloured engravings by Henry Thomas Alken.http://www.bartleby.com/224/0615.html Bartleby: Nimrod"]}, {"page": "1785 in art", "response": ["*October 12 \u2013 Henry Thomas Alken, English engraver, illustrator and sporting artist (died 1851)"]}, {"page": "1851 in art", "response": ["* April 7 \u2013 Henry Thomas Alken, English engraver, illustrator and sporting artist (born 1785)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Alken", "response": ["*Henry Thomas Alken"]}, {"page": "Henry Alken", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Thomas Alken"]}, {"page": "1851 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 April \u2013 Henry Thomas Alken, engraver, illustrator and sporting artist (born 1785)"]}, {"page": "Horses in art", "response": ["Equine sporting art was popular in the 19th century, notable artists of the period being Benjamin Marshall, James Ward, Henry Thomas Alken, James Pollard, John Frederick Herring Sr. and Heywood Hardy.
