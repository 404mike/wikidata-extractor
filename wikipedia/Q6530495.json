He released 13 players at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. His first summer signing was former two-time Player of the Year Tom Pope on a free transfer after he managed to secure his release from Bury.

However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\".
