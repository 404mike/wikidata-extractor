When Mongol rule was imposed on Tibet in the mid-13th century, Phagmodru became an appanage under H\u00fcleg\u00fc Khan (d. 1266), forming one of the thirteen myriarchies(divisions) of Central Tibet. Towards the end of the 13th century the myriarchy fell on hard times and lost territory. Its fortunes were revived by Changchub Gyaltsen, who became lord of the fief in 1322. He managed to defeat various local opponents at a time when the Yuan dynasty, overlord of Tibet, was on the decline. The Sakya regime, centered in Tsang (West Central Tibet) had hitherto wielded power over Tibet on behalf of the Mongols.Luciano Petech (1990) Central Tibet and the Mongols, Rome: ISMEO.

Possibly, the 1616 intervention is a duplicate of the similar Tsangpa invasion in 1618. His triumph was confirmed by a new successful Tsangpa invasion in 1618. Lhasa was taken, and the Gelugpa lost their most important monasteries in \u00dc and Tsang.Laurent Deshayes, Histoire du Tibet. Paris 1997, p. 142. Karma Phuntsok Namgyal now moved to eliminate the last possible obstacle to hegemony in \u00dc, namely the Phagmodrupa of N\u00eadong.
