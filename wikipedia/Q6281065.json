A Freemason, he was a member of the Zetland Lodge in Leeds. A keen sportsman, he was a follower of the Bramham Moor Hounds, and ran horses at the Wetherby Steeplechase.\nAndrews was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Barkston Ash at a by-election in October 1905 following the death of Sir Robert Gunter, defeating the Conservative candidate George Lane-Fox by 228 votes. The seat had never been won by the Liberals before.However, as Parliament was not sitting at the time, Andrews was unable to take his seat.\nAndrews lost the seat only three months later at the 1906 general election to the Conservative Party candidate, again George Lane-Fox (later 1st Baron Bingley), losing by 548 votes. His defeat was one of the few Liberal losses at an election which saw the party win a landslide majority in the House of Commons.  Andrews thus became one of the shortest-serving Members of Parliament, and one of only a handful never to take their seats.\nAndrews died, in 1909, at Boston Spa, Leeds. after two operations for appendicitis. He was 36 years old and left a widow and two children.", "link_mentions": {}}}
