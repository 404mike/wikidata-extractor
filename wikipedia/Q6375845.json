Sixteen candidates were eventually selected to form the final line-up for the fifth series, but before production could begin on the first episode, one member, Adam Freeman, was forced to drop out due to family reasons. As a result of his sudden departure, production staff were left with no time to find a replacement, leading to the decision that filming go ahead with the remaining fifteen participants, with Alan Sugar required to not hold any multiple firings outside of the Interviews stage. As such, it is the only series in the show's history to feature an unbalanced mix of male and female candidates. The first task that was filmed saw the men name their team Empire, while the women named their team Ignite. Apart from the dropout at the beginning of production, filming of the boardroom scenes for the tenth episode was delayed until the day before work on the Interviews stage was to begin, due to Kate Walsh, one of the remaining candidates by that stage of the process, requiring time off to attend a family funeral.", "| Kate Walsh"]}, {"page": "Yasmina Siadatan", "response": ["Yasmina entered The Apprentice in 2009 as one of sixteen contestants.
