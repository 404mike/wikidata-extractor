In 1827, he was commissioned to build a mansion for Sir David Scott, 2nd Baronet, on the south side of Western Road\u2014the main route from Brighton to the Brunswick Town estate and Hove.  Sillwood House, named after Scott's Berkshire residence of Silwood Park , was ready in 1828.  At the same time, on land next to the mansion, Wilds developed a small terrace of five houses called Western Terrace and for a time resided in the central house (now No.6). These five houses are in the Neoclassical style with stucco and columns; beyond these, the terrace incorporated the mansion's coach house; and at its north end Wilds built his own house in a different style again."]}, {"page": "Montagu Scott", "response": ["Scott was the son of Sir David Scott, 2nd Baronet and his wife Caroline Grindall daughter of Benjamin Grindall.

Brighton was dominated by radical Whig views at this time, and the Herald was accordingly influential.  It was \"implacably hostile\" to the long-time Vicar of Brighton Henry Michell Wagner, a strong-willed High Tory who was \"very unpopular in zealous Whig circles\".  For a man of such political views to be a vicar was \"to this paper a contradiction in terms\"; in his obituary the Herald that he should have entered the military instead.  Its criticism of Wagner was especially strong in the 1840s during a lengthy controversy over Church rates in the town.  The paper also stoked anti-Tory public feeling in its reporting of an incident involving Sir David Scott, 2nd Baronet, a magistrate and \"uncompromising Tory\", who had been made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order and granted a large pension by King George IV in questionable circumstances.  The Herald \"maintained that [his] motives were of the most mercenary and base character\", and its reporting contributed to the \"large amount of vituperation and abuse\" he received."]}]}}
