He did a Doctor of Philosophy degree at the University of London in 1967, on the subject of the 14th-century Earl of Pembroke, Aymer de Valence. Later he published a book on the same subject. Phillips was head of the department of medieval history, at the University College Dublin. Today he is professor emeritus at that school. In 2010, Phillips contributed a volume on King Edward II to the Yale English Monarchs series.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke", "response": ["T. F. Tout in 1914, one of the first historians to make a thorough academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception in an age of small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a \"middle party\", led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between the extremes of Edward and Lancaster. This \"middle party\" supposedly took control of royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J. R. S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the King's favourites, Pembroke was consistently loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a \"middle party\", but simply a restoration of royal power."]}, {"page": "Laudabiliter", "response": ["Writing about the 1317 Remonstrance (see below), the historian J. R. S. Phillips has said that \"it demonstrates that in the early fourteenth century Pope Adrian IV\u2019s bull Laudabiliter, in which he had urged Henry II of England to conquer Ireland, was regarded even by enemies of the English as a key element in the English monarchy\u2019s claims to the lordship of Ireland\"."]}, {"page": "John Roland Seymour Phillips", "response": ["#REDIRECT J.

John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.", "Dugdale both transcribed the Boulogne agreement and made a reference to it, in a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, but it was not until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when No\u00ebl Denholm-Young quoted a few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 1254\u20131310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 1307\u20131324."]}, {"page": "Scott L.
