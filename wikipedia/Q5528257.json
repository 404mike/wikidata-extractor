After their initial semi-final against Dundee United was called off, it was re-arranged a week before the final itself in a game which had everything. Dundee United took the lead when Ryan Gauld latched onto a through ball before clinically slotting past the on-coming Queen's goalkeeper. Patrick Slattery equalised scoring direct from a corner, however Gauld regained United's lead with a brilliant curling finish from the edge of the box. Just after half-time Lewis Todd drew Queen's level with a fine drive from the edge of the box, before a double from Robert Thompson saw United take a 4\u20132 lead. However, two goals in the last ten minutes meant that the game would go into extra-time. First, Slattery grabbed his second of the game, before captain Scott Hooper converted a penalty with five minutes to go.
