He also briefly managed Macclesfield Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["Lee released Freddie Goodwin, and sold Sammy Morgan to Aston Villa for \u00a322,222. He built for the 1973\u201374 campaign by drafting in tall young players David Harris and John Ridley from the youth set-up, as well as versatile Keith Chadwick from Crewe Alexandra. After a spate of injuries, he signed Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. Seemingly taking the club as far as he could, he left Burslem in January 1974 for a club with a much bigger potential. Vale finished the campaign one place and seven points above the relegation zone under the management of Roy Sproson."]}, {"page": "Debenhams Cup", "response": ["The games were played at the end of the campaign, shortly after a league meeting between the sides at Vale Park, which was to host the first leg. Goals from Neil Griffiths and Ken Beamish gave Vale a 2\u20130 victory that left them as firm favourites to win the trophy. But on a memorable night at Sealand Road, Stuart Mason, David Burns, Neil Griffiths (own goal) and Ian Howat found the net for Chester to give them a 4\u20131 victory on then night and a 4\u20133 success on aggregate. It was their first national trophy."]}, {"page": "Mark Chamberlain", "response": ["Chamberlain was born in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, to Banny and Anastasia, who emigrated to England from Jamaica in the 1960s. Chamberlain started his career with local side Port Vale, making his debut under Dennis Butler as a substitute in a 2\u20132 home draw with Scunthorpe United on 19 August 1978, aged 16. His full debut came on 14 April 1979 in a 3\u20132 win over Barnsley at Vale Park, and his first goal came two days later in a 3\u20132 defeat at Huddersfield Town. Chamberlain said: \"It was a bonus too, to find the net. Neil Griffiths encouraged me to 'hit it', after I had nipped in before the full back, and the ball flew in.\" He turned professional the following month, having made eight appearances in 1978\u201379. Chamberlain then made eleven goalless appearances in 1979\u201380, whilst his brother was the club's top-scorer in what was Vale's worst season in the Fourth Division. He became a first team regular from October 1980 under John McGrath and scored 10 goals in 36 games in the 1980\u201381 campaign. He was an ever-present in the 55 game 1981\u201382 season, also being selected in the PFA Fourth Division team and chosen as The Star's best player of the division. He scored eight goals during the campaign, most memorably when he stood off the pitch at Field Mill to avoid being caught offside, then returned to tackle a startled Rod Arnold and tap the ball into an empty net."]}, {"page": "Tony Loska", "response": ["Loska joined Port Vale in July 1971. In August, after just one game he broke his collarbone, but recovered to post 30 Third Division and five cup appearances in the 1971\u201372 season. He scored his first goal in the Football League on 6 November, in a 4\u20134 draw with fallen giants Aston Villa at Vale Park. He scored three goals in 44 games in the 1972\u201373 campaign, as manager Gordon Lee led the \"Valiants\" to a sixth-place finish. He played ten games at the start of the 1973\u201374 season, but switched to Chester in December 1973 as part of an exchange deal that saw Neil Griffiths move in the opposite direction."]}, {"page": "Martyn Smith (footballer)", "response": ["Smith played for Alsager College before joining Nantwich Town in September 1980. Moved to North West Counties League side Leek Town in November 1981 before signing for John Rudge's Port Vale in August 1984. He played 13 Fourth Division games and one FA Cup game in the 1984\u201385 season. His one and only goal in the Football League came on 28 December, in a 3\u20132 defeat to Colchester United at Layer Road. He was handed a free transfer away from Vale Park in May 1985. He moved on to Macclesfield Town of the Northern Premier League, becoming a first team regular until losing his place when manager Neil Griffiths left in February 1986. He moved on to Eastwood, before moving back to old club Leek Town, later being appointed as Leek's assistant manager.  Also served as Assistant Manager of Newcastle Town and Manager of Rocester."]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with four games unbeaten, though Tommy McLaren soon damaged his ligaments, and the team suffered in his absence. On 1 October, Vale beat Wrexham 1\u20130 in an 'ugly' game that saw five players booked and Colin Tartt and opposition player Arfon Griffiths separated by police following a scrap in the tunnel. Later in the month Roy Cross badly injured his knee, and would later have to leave the professional game due to the injury. Vale slipped down the league, and by Christmas they were sixth from bottom, with only John Woodward in good form. Lee then took out striker Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. He also changed the formation from 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133, hoping to give Brian Horton more room in the centre of the park. After an upturn in form in the new year, Bill Summerscales broke his neck, and Lee departed for the management position at Blackburn Rovers. Lee had been seen to have done an excellent job with little money. In his place club legend Roy Sproson was appointed as caretaker manager, who advocated an 'entertaining' style of play as opposed to battling for every point. Winning his first match 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town, he cracked his head on the concrete trainer's box after leaping up to celebrate McLaren's goal. On 17 February, 8,505 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 3\u20131 win over high-flying Bristol Rovers in an experimental Sunday game. Later Leonard returned to Villa Park at the end of his loan deal, and \u00a35,000 was not enough to tempt Villa to part with his services permanently. From mid-March Vale went eleven games without a win, and on 25 March they could have ended this run, but 'a shocking mistake' from Alan Boswell handed Walsall an equalizer as he palmed a header into his own net. The team continued to rack up yellow cards, and following a warning from The Football Association, Sproson arranged for local referee Roy Capey to lecture the players on sportsmanship. In the middle of April, Sproson was given the management job on a permanent basis, despite his team falling to fifth from bottom. Sproson stated that he was 'calculated' and 'controlled', compared to Lee who 'fizzes like a bottle of pop'. By the time they broke their poor run with a 2\u20131 home win over managerless Charlton Athletic, other results had already ensured their safety from the drop.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Neil Griffiths", "| December 1973 || DF ||  || Neil Griffiths || Chester || Exchange || "]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Neil Griffiths"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Neil Griffiths", "|\u2013||DF||||Neil Griffiths||1||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Neil Griffiths", "|\u2013||DF||||Neil Griffiths||0||1||0||1||2"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Neil Griffiths", "|4||DF||||Neil Griffiths||4||0||0||4"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Neil Griffiths", "|\u2013||DF||||Neil Griffiths||1||0||0||1", "| May 1978 || DF ||  || Neil Griffiths ||  Cleveland Cobras || August 1978 || "]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Neil Griffiths", "|5||DF||||Neil Griffiths||4||0||0||4"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On the financial side, a \u00a312,496 loss was announced.
