New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights. The rise of rave culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ Pete Tong amongst others. There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show. This quickly gave birth to the Essential Mix where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot. Dance and urban music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as Judge Jules, Danny Rampling,  Trevor Nelson, and the Dreem Teem all moving from London's Kiss 100 to the station.", "On 7 December 2011, Ben Cooper's first major changes to the station were announced.

Instead of discouraging people to attend, this policy only made the event more popular as gaining admittance to the club only added to the sense of excitement. The door policy also ensured that only dedicated and enthusiastic clubbers gained access. This resulted in a clientele and atmosphere that was rare at that time in any club in the UK. The door policy, and fashion at the end of the 1990s, encouraged people to dress in a flamboyant style to ensure entry to the night. The club developed a cult following (Gatecrasher Kids) who in turn developed their own style of fashion, identifiable by fluorescent clothes, dummies, and spiky hair.
