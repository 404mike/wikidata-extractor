It went through various rebuilding campaigns. About half of the shops here have Victorian or Edwardian fa\u00e7ades, although storefronts are almost exclusively modern. The corner of Green's End with the south side of Powis Street (nrs 1\u20137) was redeveloped in 1958\u201360, after a design by British-American architect Hector Hamilton. It features glass curtain walls with artificial-stone mullions, a pavement canopy and a set-back corner with diamond-patterned ornament. The next two buildings on the south side (nrs 9-21) are of the same proportions and from the same period but were both refronted in the first decade of the 21st century. This is followed by what was originally a uniform row of seven shops by H.H. Church, built in 1899\u20131900, of which three have survived (nrs 23\u201327). Further west are a three-bay shop from 1925 (nrs 33\u201335), some unassuming brick buildings of 1956-58 (nrs 37\u201345), another brick building of 2013-14 that replaced a shop by H.H. Church destroyed in the 2011 London riots (nrs 47\u201349), and two shops by local builder W. Harris of 1866-68 (nrs 51\u201353). The Marks & Spencer building on the corner of Calderwood Street (nrs 55\u201369) was started in the 1930s and extended in a similar style in the 1960s. Its fa\u00e7ade is clad with artificial-stone tiles, which was the company's uniform style at the time.Saint & Guillery (2012), pp. 200-202."]}]}}
