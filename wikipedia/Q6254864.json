This was to prove an important influence on Bion's interest in group behavior. Having qualified in medicine by means of the Conjoint Diploma (MRCS England, LRCP London) in 1930The Medical Directory, 125th edition, 1969 Bion spent seven years in psychotherapeutic training at the Tavistock Clinic, an experience he regarded, in retrospect, as having had some limitations. It did, however, bring him into fruitful contact with Samuel Beckett. He wanted to train in Psychoanalysis and in 1938 he began a training analysis with John Rickman, but this was brought to an end by the advent of the Second World War.", "Category:Analysands of John Rickman"]}, {"page": "British Psychoanalytical Society", "response": ["In 1919, Ernest Jones refounded the society as the British Psychoanalytical Society, and served as its President.

In April 1942 it became a military psychiatric hospital and became known as Northfield Military Hospital. In 1942, while Northfield was serving as a military hospital, psychoanalysts Wilfred Bion and John Rickman set up the first Northfield experiment. Bion and Rickman were in charge of the training and rehabilitation wing of Northfield, and ran the unit along the principles of group dynamics. Their aim was to improve morale by creating a \"good group spirit\" (esprit de corps). Though he sounded like a traditional army officer Bion's means were very unconventional. He was in charge of around one hundred men. He told them that they had to do an hour's exercise every day and that each had to join a group: \"handicrafts, Army courses, carpentry, map-reading, sand-tabling etc.... or form a fresh group if he wanted to do so\". While this may have looked like traditional occupational therapy, the real therapy was the struggle to manage the interpersonal strain of organising things together, rather than simply weaving baskets. Those unable to join a group would have to go to the rest-room, where a nursing orderly would supervise a quiet regime of \"reading, writing or games such as draughts... any men who felt unfit for any activity whatever could lie down\". The focus of every day was a meeting of all the men, referred to as a parade."]}, {"page": "Rickman", "response": ["*John Rickman (parliamentary official) (1771\u20131840), English statistician and government official", "*John Rickman (psychoanalyst) (1891\u20131951), English psychoanalyst"]}, {"page": "Helton Godwin Baynes", "response": ["Baynes was educated at Leighton Park School (along with two other leading members of the British Psychoanalytical Society: John Rickman and Lionel Penrose) and then at Trinity College, Cambridge where he read medicine and where he won Blues for Rowing and Swimming two years running.

This scheme was announced in the House of Lords in July 1944. In November 1944, a pilot unit called No. 10 Special Reception and Training Unit (SRTU) was set up in Derby. Wilson was selected to head this Unit as opposed to Bion, who expressed his dismay in a letter to fellow psychiatrist John Rickman. Bion believed that the psychological principles underpinning the CRUs, which built on his earlier work at Northfield, were underdeveloped and needed further refinement. However, the first group of POWs were imminently due to return to Britain from Germany, which is likely why Wilson was selected to lead the SRTU."]}, {"page": "John Rickman", "response": ["John Rickman may refer to:", "*John Rickman (activist) (1910\u20131937), British communist activist ", "*John Rickman (broadcaster) (1913\u20131997), British broadcaster and journalist", "*John Rickman (parliamentary official)  (1771\u20131840), British statistician and parliamentary official", "*John Rickman (psychoanalyst) (1891\u20131951), British psychoanalyst"]}]}}
