In the less than exacting context of a game against Cambridge University in 1961, he batted at No 11 and scored 37 in a last-wicket partnership with Gordon Marshall, and this was his highest first-class score. But it was the penultimate match of his first-class career and he left the Warwickshire staff at the end of the season."]}]}}
