His sponsor for entry into England as an alien was Frances Margesson, wife of Captain (later Viscount) Margesson; the Neuraths stayed with the Margessons at Boddington, near Rugby, for some five years and their son Thomas was born there. Neurath was offered work by a company called Adprint, run by a fellow refugee, Wolfgang Foges. He soon became the production manager designing and producing the successful King Penguin series, effectively Penguin's first hardcover books. Neurath went on to develop a more ambitious series called Britain in Pictures, edited by Walter J. Turner in which the illustrations were an integral part of a book, prominently placed together with the words to which they were related, rather than banishing them to the plates section elsewhere the book. The series combined skilful picture research with fine design and printing including significant texts from George Orwell (The English People), Rose Macaulay (Life among the English), John Piper (British Romantic Artists), Michael Ayrton (British Drawings), and Jacquetta Hawkes (Early Britain); the series eventually comprised more than 100 volumes."]}, {"page": "Sarah Truax", "response": ["Aside for a brief two-night special engagement at the Garden Theatre with E.

The frequent changes of players meant that only \"a few celebrated batons, except Beecham's, and possibly Wood's were a regular match for prevailing conditions in the orchestra.\" Arthur Schnabel was so unhappy about a performance of Mozart's A Major concerto K488 which he had given at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert with Basil Cameron that he wrote to The Times on 18 Jan 1930 to explain that the concert had been inadequately rehearsed. Walter J. Turner, the music critic of the New Statesman (25 January 1930) commented that the orchestra were \"tired and apathetic\", and that Schnabel's gesture to pay for an extra 30 minutes' rehearsal had to be refused since the extensive use of deputies reduced it to a meaningless gesture."]}]}}
