FAW secretary Ted Robbins' side, playing on a Saturday when the English leagues had a full programme, had no choice but to play 10 players from either the lower divisions, Welsh League sides, or from the non-leagues. The Welsh featured just seven players from Football League sides, with only Keenor and Cardiff teammates Len Evans and Walter Robbins playing in the top two divisions. The rest of the side contained three players from Welsh league sides Cardiff Corinthians, Llanelli and Colwyn Bay and one player from non-league side Oswestry Town. The side featured nine debutants in the line-up, with Keenor and Cardiff teammate Len Evans being the only two with previous experience at international level. Wales had been forced into a similar situation eight months earlier, in February 1930, when Keenor had played in a severely weakened side that lost 7\u20130 to Ireland. Joe Bambrick scored six of Ireland's seven goals in the game.

The club's first home match of the season was against Burnley on 1 September and was preceded by an opening ceremony for the newly constructed roof above the Grange End Stand which was led by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Arthur John Howell. Ferguson continued his strong start to the season by scoring five times, with Len Davies adding a brace, during a 7\u20130 victory. As of August 2020, the result remains the team's largest win in the top tier while Ferguson's tally of five is the most scored by a Cardiff player in a league match, tied with Walter Robbins and Jim Henderson.

Albert Miles scored the only goal of the game to give Cardiff their first win in 11 matches to move them out of the relegation zone. Teenager Walter Robbins, who made his professional debut against Portsmouth, scored his first senior goal to earn his side a 1\u20131 draw with Bolton Wanderers on 15 December but two further defeats on 22 and 25 December against Blackburn Rovers and Leeds United left Cardiff in the relegation zone again.

With Ferguson gone and Len Davies dropped from the side, Cardiff began the season with new signing Valentine and highly-rated teenager Walter Robbins leading their attack. The latter started the campaign well, scoring his side's goal in the opening day defeat to Charlton before adding a brace in a 2\u20130 win over Preston North End two days later at Ninian Park. Valentine played only one further game for the club, a 1\u20130 defeat to Hull City on 7 September, before being replaced by Davies. The club's fans, already disenchanted by their side's relegation, grew increasingly frustrated with Cardiff's poor form.
