Cardiff's Hardy later noted how nervous he and his teammates were at the start of the match, describing the side as \"shaking like kittens\". United's forward pairing of Gillespie and Tunstall proved testing to the Cardiff defence early on and the majority of the opening period was spent in the Welsh side's half. Johnson nearly gave United the lead when he received David Mercer's cross unmarked in the opposition area but he was unable to immediately control the ball, which allowed Blair to close in and block his effort. Cardiff's best chance of the first half fell to Nicholson, who received the ball near the edge of the opposition penalty area. Despite having space to run into, Nicholson chose to shoot early but his effort went well over the bar. Nicholson caused issues for the United defence on the edge of their area that drew a foul from Ernest Milton on Willie Davies, but the resulting effort was wasted. Cardiff had few further opportunities in the first half; the Devon and Exeter Gazette described how Cardiff \"placed the ball too square, so that speed was lost\".", "|FW || David Mercer"]}, {"page": "David Mercer", "response": ["David Mercer may refer to:", "* Sir David Mercer (Royal Marines officer)  (1864\u20131920), British Royal Marines officer", "* David Mercer (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u20131950), England international footballer", "* David Mercer (footballer, born 1918) (1918\u20131986), English footballer", "* David Mercer (playwright) (1928\u20131980), English dramatist", "* David Mercer (broadcaster) (1950\u20132020), British sports presenter", "* David Mercer (weightlifter) (born 1961), British Olympic weightlifter", "* David Mercer (cricketer) (born 1962), English cricketer", "* David Mercer (writer) (born 1976), technical writer", "* David Mercer (alpine skier) (born 1960), British former alpine skier", "* David Mercer (racing driver) (born 1949), British former racing driver", "* David Mercer MacDougall (1904\u20131991), colonial secretary of Hong Kong, 1945\u20131949"]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["Needing a replacement for Percy Mackrill, who had left the club before the end of the previous season, Torquay United appointed former Birmingham City full back Frank Womack as their new manager.Edwards, Leigh; Gibbes, Jon; Lovis, John (1999). Torquay United, The Official Centenary History, 1899-1999. Yore Publications.   Womack soon set about putting a together a new squad in an effort to improve upon the lowly finishes of Torquay's first two seasons in the League.  Debutants on the opening day of the season included centre half Harry Bruce, inside forward Harry Keeling and the ex-Sheffield United FA Cup winner David Mercer.  However, the Magpies made a slow start to the campaign, losing their opening four games, and it was not until the introduction of forwards Joe Pointon and Les Robinson that results slowly began to improve.  Effectively displacing Keeling and United mainstay Dan Kelly from the team, Pointon and Robinson ended up scoring a total of 34 goals between them by the end of the season.  Robinson became the first Torquay player to score four goals in a League match in the 5\u20132 win over Walsall in November and, not to be outdone, Pointon repeated the feat in a famous 7\u20130 victory over Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic the following March.  Indeed, it was Pointon and Robinson who scored the goals at Gillingham to secure Torquay's first and only away win of the season.Edwards, Leigh (1997). The Definitive Torquay United F.C..
