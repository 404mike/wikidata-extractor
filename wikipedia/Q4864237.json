He made his first-team debut for the Stags shortly before his 19th birthday, on 4 September 1971 against Plymouth Argyle. Incidentally, his unrelated namesake Colin Foster made his debut in the same game.At first, Foster had to bide his time in a reserve role, but when first-choice left-back Clive Walker went down with an injury, Foster took advantage of the opportunity, and secured a regular place in the side. He was a member of the Mansfield side that finished top of Division Four in 1975, and also won Division Three two years later. However, Foster broke his leg against Portsmouth on the day promotion was confirmed, causing him to miss most of the club's Division Two campaign the following season.In total, Foster played 343 matches for Mansfield in all competitions, without ever scoring a single goal for the club. He was released at the end of the 1981-82 season, and finished his career with a season at non-league Boston United. After retiring from the game, he joined his family's market-trading business.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Foster (footballer, born 1952)", "response": ["Foster came through the ranks at Mansfield, and made his debut on 4 September 1971 against Plymouth Argyle, in the same game that his unrelated namesake Barry Foster also made his debut.
