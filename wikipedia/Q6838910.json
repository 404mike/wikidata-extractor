Vale played numerous friendlies, as well as taking part in the regional war leagues. They finished eighth in the West League in 1939\u201340. Unable to raise sufficient finances from 1940 onwards, they only put forward an amateur side filled with young players in the North Staffordshire League, also entering cup competitions such as The Sentinel Cup. They recorded some very one-sided victories over local amateur teams such as Shelton Labour, Hanley Deep Pit, and Northwood Mission. Some of Vale's top professionals signed to sides such as Stoke City, Crewe Alexandra, and Manchester United. Players that guested for the club included names such as Peter Doherty, Micky Fenton, Frank Soo and Dennis Wilshaw.
