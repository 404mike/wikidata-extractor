Meanwhile, Bloomfield's reputation was increased by the appearance of his Rural Tales (1802), several poems of which were set to music by his brother Isaac. Another of them, \"The Miller's Maid\", was turned into an opera in 1804 by John Davy (1763\u20131824) and formed the basis for a two-act melodrama by John Faucit Saville in 1821.Open Library Other publications by Bloomfield included Good Tidings (in praise of inoculation at the instigation of Edward Jenner, 1804); Wild Flowers or Pastoral and Local Poetry (1806); and The Banks of the Wye (a poetic journal of a walking tour taken in the footsteps of Wordsworth, 1811)."]}, {"page": "Saville", "response": ["*John Faucit Saville or Savill, (1783?\u20131853), English actor and theatre manager, husband of Harriet"]}, {"page": "Faucit", "response": ["*John Faucit Saville (1783?\u20131853), English actor, known as Mr Faucit"]}, {"page": "Thomas Cooke (actor)", "response": ["On 9 August 1820, Cooke had major success at the Lyceum as Lord Ruthven, the hero of The Vampyre, and in the following year strengthened his reputation as Dirk Hatteraick in the Witch of Derncleugh, a version of Guy Mannering, George in The Miller's Maid (a melodrama of John Faucit Saville from Robert Bloomfield), and Frankenstein's monster in Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein, Richard Brinsley Peake's 1823 adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein.

At the close of the season he visited Paris, and presented Le Monstre et le Magicien (again playing Frankenstein's monster) 80 successive nights at the Porte-Saint-Martin.
