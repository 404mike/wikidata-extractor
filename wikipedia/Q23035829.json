The government later passed the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act\u00a01913 (more commonly known as the \"Cat and Mouse Act\"), which allowed the release of suffragettes who were close to death due to malnourishment. Officers, however, could re-imprison them again once they were healthy. This was an attempt to avoid force-feeding. In response, the WSPU organised an all-women security team known as the Bodyguard, trained in ju-jitsu by Edith Margaret Garrud and led by Gertrude Harding, whose role was to protect fugitive suffragettes from re-imprisonment.Rouse, Wendy Her Own Hero: The Origins of the Women's Self-Defense Movement.
