The sport of cricket had acquired most of its modern features by this time and roundarm bowling was firmly established.\nMore county cricket clubs began to become established during this period, following the establishment of Sussex County Cricket Club in 1839. Clubs were formally established in Nottinghamshire, Kent and Surrey, all of which remain first-class counties today. These teams competed against each other and other teams, although the County Championship was not formally established until 1890.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1841 and 1850 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hadden", "response": ["Hadden is the place name of:", "* Hadden, Roxburghshire, Scotland", "Hadden is the surname of:", "*Al Hadden (1899-1969), American professional football player", "*Alf Hadden (1877-1936), Australian cricketer", "*Briton Hadden (1898\u20131929), co-founder of Time magazine with Henry Luce and its first editor", "*Charles Hadden (1854\u20131924), British Army major-general and Master-General of the Ordnance", "*Dianne Hadden (born 1951), Australian politician", "*Frank Hadden (born 1954), Scottish rugby union coach", "*H.
