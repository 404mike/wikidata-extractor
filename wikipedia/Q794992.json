The first time this occurred was in November 2001 when Leicester City came to Old Trafford. As Muzzy Izzet prepared to take a penalty, Barthez stood aside from the goal, with his hands behind him on the post. Izzet, tired of waiting, slotted the ball in the bottom corner, but referee Andy D'Urso made him retake the penalty, this time with Barthez in goal. Izzet went the same way, but Barthez denied him with a fine save to his right. An almost identical incident happened less than a year later in October 2002, when Barthez was unhappy about the awarding of a penalty to Fulham, and so went from post to post banging his boots, and refused to be in goal for the penalty. This time he was booked for his antics by referee Mike Dean, and so he then took his place between the posts and made it work again by saving Steed Malbranque's spot kick."]}, {"page": "Swansea City A.F.C.", "response": ["Swansea have won 36 of the 106 competitive meetings, compared to Cardiff's 43, who also have the biggest result between the two sides with Swansea losing 5\u20130 in 1965, with a further 27 drawn; to this day, neither team has done the double.

He stated that Stoke's team spirit was the main reason for his move to the club. He made his debut on 15 August 2009 in a 2\u20130 win over Burnley.

Whitehead scored his first goal for Stoke when he converted winger Matthew Etherington's cross in the 86th-minute in a 3\u20131 FA Cup fourth-round win over Arsenal at the Britannia Stadium on 24 January 2010.
