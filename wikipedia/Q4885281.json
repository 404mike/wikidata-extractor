This was what creative fidelity is meant to look like\". He added that, \"Pete Travis\u2019s roving camerawork revealed the gilded paradise of Brandon Hall [sic - Brandham Hall] in impressionistic glances and lush screen grabs of floating pollen and wafting corn. As for the protagonists, he shot Joanna Vanderham\u2019s Marian as a radiant extension of the sun, while Ben Batt\u2019s Ted suggested a gritty compound of gnarled oak and loamy earth\". Rees singled out Jack Hollington for especial praise, \"as smitten young Leo, whose trusting eyes caught brief confused glimpses of his coming expulsion from Eden. This was a superbly intuitive performance from a child actor bearing a heavy burden. Hollington held his ground throughout, with Vanderham\u2019s manipulative Marian and Batt\u2019s taciturn Ted (both excellent), and even when Lesley Manville as Marian\u2019s tightly wound mother tried to worm the shattering truth out of him. In the key scenes he sang like Ernest Lough and took his cricket catch like Ben Stokes\". He concluded that, \"Intensified by Christian Henson\u2019s swooning soundtrack, this was a deeply moving reverie about a life sacrificed not in the mud of Flanders but on the sun-baked lawns of Norfolk\".", "Writing in The Guardian, Sam Wollaston preferred the BBC\u2019s adaptation over Downton Abbey, broadcast at the same time on a rival channel, calling it \"a more edifying experience\". He added, \"Sensitively adapted (as all these Sunday-night BBC dramas have been so far) from LP Hartley by Adrian Hodges, it has a/the novel\u2019s intensity, subtlety and complexity of character and theme (innocence, betrayal, the past and what it does to someone). And its direction and satisfactory arc \u2013 it knows where it\u2019s going and it\u2019s a bloody good story\". Wollaston also noticed Hollington\u2019s portrayal, giving him a \"a special shout-out [\u2026] not just for his convincing performance as young Leo but also for being a totally convincing young Jim Broadbent (old Leo)\", which he also extended \"to Ben Batt (Ted Burgess) for the best topless scything since Poldark. Not too Downton (Abbey \u2013 shabby) from Joanna Vanderham as Marian either\".
