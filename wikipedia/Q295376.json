He has also compiled 12 competitive maximum breaks, placing him second behind O'Sullivan (15). He has been ranked world number 1 on four occasions.In 2010, the News of the World tabloid newspaper carried out a sting operation in a hotel room in Ukraine, which claimed to show Higgins and his then-manager arranging to lose specific frames in future matches for money. Although an investigation cleared Higgins of match-fixing allegations, it was found that he had brought the sport into disrepute by failing to report, and giving the impression of agreeing with, an invitation to breach the sport's betting rules. The WPBSA banned Higgins from professional competition for six months and fined him \u00a375,000. He returned to the tour midway through the 2010\u201311 season.\nAfter winning his fourth world title in 2011, Higgins experienced a slump in form, and between 2012 and 2014 only won the 2012 Shanghai Masters.

Former world champion Stuart Bingham also takes a statistical view of the question, stating that O'Sullivan is the \"best player to pick up a cue\" but Hendry's record of seven world titles settles the debate as to who the greatest player is.
