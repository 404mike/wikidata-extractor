Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of language. Prague school linguist Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd writes that Saussure's \"discovery of the internal structure of the linguistic sign differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic 'things'... and from mental processes\", and that in this development \"new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature\".Mukarovsky, J. 1977.

It has become a target precisely  of its scope, its claims to authority, its British-centredness and relative neglect of World Englishes, its implied but not acknowledged focus on literary language and, above all, its influence. The OED, as a commercial product, has always had to manoeuvre a thin line between PR, marketing and scholarship and one can argue that its biggest problem is the critical uptake of the work by the interested public. In his review of the 1982 supplement, University of Oxford linguist Roy Harris writes that criticizing the OED is extremely difficult because \"one is dealing not just with a dictionary but with a national institution\", one that \"has become, like the English monarchy, virtually immune from criticism in principle\". He further notes that neologisms from respected \"literary\" authors such as Samuel Beckett and Virginia Woolf are included, whereas usage of words in newspapers or other less \"respectable\" sources hold less sway, even though they may be commonly used. He writes that the OEDs \"[b]lack-and-white lexicography is also black-and-white in that it takes upon itself to pronounce authoritatively on the rights and wrongs of usage\", faulting the dictionary's prescriptive rather than descriptive usage. To Harris, this prescriptive classification of certain usages as \"erroneous\" and the complete omission of various forms and usages cumulatively represent the \"social bias[es]\" of the (presumably well-educated and wealthy) compilers. However, the identification of \"erroneous and catachrestic\" usages is being removed from third edition entries, sometimes in favour of usage notes describing the attitudes to language which have previously led to these classifications."]}, {"page": "Course in General Linguistics", "response": ["Course in General Linguistics () is a book compiled by Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye from notes on lectures given by Ferdinand de Saussure at the University of Geneva between 1906 and 1911.
