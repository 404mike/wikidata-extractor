He signed his first professional contract with the club in November 1959, but it was not until 4 November 1961 that he made his first team debut. The game ended up as a 3\u20131 defeat by Sheffield Wednesday, but McMillan was not disheartened and went on to score six goals that season, in which he played in 11 matches.\nMcMillan's first season at Old Trafford led to him being picked for the Northern Ireland national team in the autumn of 1962. He played in two matches, against England and Scotland in the 1963 British Home Championship, but failed to get on the scoresheet and only played for his country on one further occasion \u2013 an Under-23 international in 1964.\nWith Manchester United, a similar story to his international career followed for McMillan in 1962\u201363. He only made four appearances during the entire season, all of which came before Christmas, and he was unable to add to the six goals he had scored in his first season. The same happened at the start of the 1963\u201364 season, and although United manager Matt Busby offered to extend McMillan's contract by a year, the Ulsterman was desperate for first team football and he was sold to Wrexham for \u00a38,000 on Christmas Eve 1963.\nMcMillan scored a commendable seven goals from 20 appearances in his first season with Wrexham, but it was not enough to prevent the Welsh side from being relegated to the Fourth Division. In five seasons with Wrexham, McMillan scored a total of 52 goals, including a season's best of 18 in 1966\u201367, and was just one appearance short of 150 for the Red Dragons before being sold to Southend United for \u00a36,000 in 1967. At Southend, McMillan was deployed in a more withdrawn midfield role than he had been with Manchester United and Wrexham, and so he scored just five goals in nearly 80 appearances for the Shrimpers.\nAfter just over two seasons with Southend, a \u00a32,000 move to Wrexham's local rivals Chester followed, but he was released to sign for Stockport County at the end of the 1969\u201370 season. At Stockport, McMillan reverted to his old position in the forward line and amassed a total of 29 league goals in 74 appearances before a back injury forced his retirement in 1972.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 20", "response": ["*  1941   \u2013 Sammy McMillan, Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "Wrexham A.F.C.", "response": ["* Sammy McMillan"]}, {"page": "Southend United F.C.", "response": ["*Most Goals (League Cup): Sammy McMillan (15\u00a0\u2013 1967\u201369) and David Martin (15\u00a0\u2013 1986\u20131993)"]}, {"page": "Manchester United F.C.

The following week saw Ipswich travel to Molineux where they faced Wolverhampton Wanderers.  The visitors were down to ten men after just six minutes as Roy Stephenson was forced to withdraw following a thigh injury.  Two late goals from Wolves, from Terry Wharton and Alan Hinton, resulted in a 2\u20130 defeat for Ipswich.  Matt Busby's Manchester United were Ipswich's opponents at Portman Road on 18 November, with the home side winning 4\u20131 with goals from Phillips (2), Crawford and Elsworthy, and United's late consolation goal coming from Sammy McMillan.  Both Busby and Ramsey acclaimed Phillips, the former suggesting that he had the \"hardest and most accurate shot in the game at present\" while the latter agreed: \"Ted is the best shot of my time.\"  The final game of November saw Ipswich visit Ninian Park where they faced Cardiff City.  With a performance described in the East Anglian Daily Times as \"deadly\", \"efficient\" and \"polished and planned\", the home team won 3\u20130 with goals from Moran and Phillips (2).  They finished the month in second place in the league, three points behind Burnley who had a game in hand, and a point ahead of West Ham United and Everton.
