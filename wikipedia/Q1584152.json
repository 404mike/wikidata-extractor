In 1947, while serving in the British Army of the Rhine, he started Operation Fantast, a network of science fiction fans which had 800 members around the world by 1950 though it folded a few years later. Through Operation Fantast, he was the major importer of American science fiction books and magazines into Britain - an activity which he continued, after its collapse, through his company Fantast (Medway) up to the time of his death. He was a founder member of the British Science Fiction Association in 1958.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Science fiction fandom", "response": ["* Ken Slater"]}, {"page": "List of Worldcons", "response": ["| Doris Lessing (UK)Alfred Bester (US)Boris and Arkady Strugatsky (USSR)Jim Burns (artist)Ray Harryhausen (film)Joyce Slater and Ken Slater (fan)David Langford (special fan)"]}, {"page": "British Science Fiction Association", "response": ["The third attempt was in 1948, when Captain Ken Slater proposed the founding of a new national fan organisation.

William F. Temple was involved as an editorial consultant and also assisted with editing the manuscripts.Philip Harbottle, \"Introduction\", in Bounds, Best of Sydney J. Bounds, Vol. 1, p.\u00a012. Hamilton provided all the financing, but he had to wait for the money to come in from each issue before he could afford to produce the next. In addition, Crownpoint only intermittently had enough spare capacity to print Nebula, so the first few issues appeared on an erratic schedule.  After a dozen issues, the conflicts led to Hamilton moving Nebula to a printing firm based in Dublin, and breaking the connection with Crownpoint.  He was then able to publish on a slightly more regular schedule, although the planned bi-monthly issues were still sometimes delayed. Hamilton paid 21 shillings (\u00a31.05) per thousand words, the equivalent of three-tenths of a cent per word; this was a low rate compared to the American market, but was marginally better than the contemporary British magazine Authentic Science Fiction, which paid \u00a31 per thousand words.Ashley, History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 3, pp.\u00a068\u201371 Hamilton offered a bonus of \u00a32 or \u00a35 to the story that turned out to be the readers' favourite in each issue, which helped attract writers; and he later increased the rates, paying as much as 2d (0.8p, or 2.3 cents) per word for well-known authors.  This was higher than the best UK markets, such as New Worlds, and was close to the rates paid by the top magazines in the US at that time. Both the high rates of pay and Hamilton's willingness to work with new authors were designed to encourage writers to submit their work to Nebula before trying the other magazines.Philip Harbottle, \"Remembering Phil High\", in Fantasy Adventures 13, p.\u00a0122.", "* Jim Linwood's Nebula site \u2013 information on fan contributions, letters, artwork, scans of all the covers, and a complete archive of Ken Slater's book review columns"]}, {"page": "Ken Slater", "response": ["Ken Slater may refer to:", "*Ken Slater (science fiction) (1917\u20132008), British science fiction fan and bookseller", "*Ken Slater (sportsman) (1924\u20131963), Australian rules footballer and tennis player", "*Ken Slater (herpetologist) (1923\u20131999), Australian engineer and herpetologist"]}]}}
