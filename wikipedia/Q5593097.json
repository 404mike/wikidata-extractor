Lee quickly earned the respect of the Vale fans despite his team lying bottom of the table in mid-September. A new club mascot was unveiled at this time \u2013 'Prince Val'. Some good home performances lifted the club off the bottom of the table, including a 4\u20131 thumping of Scunthorpe United and a stylish back-heeled goal from Roy Sproson in a 1\u20131 draw with Lincoln City.

In November, goalkeeper Keith Ball was signed from Walsall for 'a small fee' and Graham Newton joined on trial after leaving the Atlanta Chiefs.
