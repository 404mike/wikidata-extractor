In front of each set of benches a red line is drawn, which members are traditionally not allowed to cross during debates. The Prime Minister and the government ministers, as well as the leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Cabinet sit on the front rows, and are known as frontbenchers. Other members of parliament, in contrast, are known as backbenchers. Not all Members of Parliament can fit into the chamber at the same time, as it only has space to seat approximately two thirds of the Members. According to Robert Rogers, former Clerk of the House of Commons and Chief Executive, a figure of 427 seats is an average or a finger-in-the-wind estimate. Members who arrive late must stand near the entrance of the house if they wish to listen to debates. Sittings in the chamber are held each day from Monday to Thursday, and also on some Fridays. During times of national emergency, the house may also sit at weekends."]}, {"page": "Palace of Westminster", "response": ["Speeches may not be read out during debate in the House of Commons, although notes may be referred to. Similarly, the reading of newspapers is not allowed. Visual aids are discouraged in the chamber. Applause is also not normally allowed in the Commons, but it has since been tolerated in certain cases. Some notable exceptions to this were when Robin Cook gave his resignation speech in 2003; when Prime Minister Tony Blair appeared for the last time at Prime Minister's Questions; when Speaker Michael Martin gave his leaving speech on 17 June 2009; and after the resignation statement of Sir Robert Rogers, Clerk of the House. At the start of the new parliament in May 2015, the large influx of new Scottish National Party MPs flouted the convention and repeatedly applauded their party leader, to the displeasure of the Speaker."]}, {"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane"]}, {"page": "Robert Rogers", "response": ["Robert Rogers may refer to:", "*Robert Rogers (Irish politician) (died 1719), Irish politician, MP for Cork City 1692\u20131699", "*Robert Rogers (Manitoba politician) (1864\u20131936), Canadian politician", "*Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane (born 1950), Chief Executive and Clerk of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom", "*Robert Rogers (British Army officer) (1731\u20131795), American colonial officer, explorer, and playwright", "*Robert Rogers (novelist), American writer under the pen names of Lee Rogers, Jean Barrett, and Jean Thomas"]}, {"page": "Lisvane", "response": ["*Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane, Clerk of the House of Commons, 2011\u201314."]}, {"page": "Clerk of the House of Commons", "response": ["*2011 \u2013 Sir Robert Rogers KCB"]}, {"page": "Welsh peers and baronets", "response": ["|Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane||of Blakemere in the County of Herefordshireand of Lisvane in the City and County of Cardiff||2014||Current"]}, {"page": "List of Old Tonbridgians", "response": ["* Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane, Clerk of the House of Commons"]}, {"page": "Malcolm Jack", "response": ["He was succeeded by Robert Rogers on 1 October 2011.House of Commons Debates 4 June 2011 c 677."]}, {"page": "Robert Rogers (Clerk)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane"]}, {"page": "Robert James Rogers", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of Lincoln College, Oxford", "response": ["* Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane"]}, {"page": "2014 Special Honours", "response": ["* Sir Robert Rogers,  to be Baron Lisvane, of Blakemere in the County of Herefordshire and of Lisvane in the City and County of Cardiff - 15 December 2014"]}, {"page": "Robert Rogers (parliamentary official)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Rogers, Baron Lisvane"]}, {"page": "David Natzler", "response": ["Sir David Lionel Natzler  (born 16 August 1952) is a former Clerk of the House of Commons, the principal constitutional adviser to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, and adviser on all its procedure and business.
