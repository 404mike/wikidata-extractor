Meadows won more races than Webster\u00a0\u2013 Meadows with nine overall wins plus a further two class wins, while Webster took five overall wins with a further class win\u00a0\u2013 but Webster's greater consistency allowed him to take the overall championship by nine points, ahead of the two-time defending champion Meadows. Webster finished each race as one of the best three finishers in class, including the overseas round at Le Mans, where he was seventh overall. Third place in the championship went to Paul Rees, who took a race victory at Rockingham, and three further podium finishes. The only other drivers to take race victories were Ben Barker, who achieved an overall victory at Le Mans\u00a0\u2013 as well as two victories in the guest car in the opening Brands Hatch round\u00a0\u2013 and Daniel Cammish, who took a win in the guest car at the final round. Redline Racing were comfortable winners of the teams' championship, finishing almost 200 points clear of In2Racing, the next best team."]}, {"page": "2017 Porsche Supercup", "response": ["| align=left |  Daniel Cammish"]}]}}
