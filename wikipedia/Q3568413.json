This decision met with disapproval from Cotton's father who said \"You are not missionary material\". Cotton did have some of the practical skills which would be valuable; he could use various tools, including a lathe, ride a horse, and row and sail boats. The Tomatin sailed from London for Plymouth Sound without its clerical cargo who went overland to Plymouth before eventually boarding the ship there. Cotton had loaded some hives of bees aboard but had not packed them securely within a hogshead as planned in My Bee Book. Delayed in the English Channel by contrary winds the bee hives were so thrown about aboard the Tomatin that they were jettisoned overboard in Plymouth Sound in Cotton's absence. The missionary party of 23 members set sail from Plymouth late on 26 December 1841 on board the barque Tomatin.  On the ship, in addition to their luggage, were various animals and possibly, an unknown number of hives of bees.  Cotton's letter dated 30 December 1841, passed to a homeward bound brig on 21 January, stated the bees were safe. However, given the short time available from the Tomatin's arrival in Plymouth Sound on 19 December, the daily hope that contrary winds would abate so they could sail \"on the morrow,\" and the party boarding on 23 December, there's little likelihood he had the time to organize a replacement lot of bees.Barrett, Peter (2013) The Immigrant Bees, Volume V (pp.423-429) Either way, the fate of the bees is unknown, they did not survive the trip to Sydney. Also on board was a M\u0101ori boy who taught many of the passengers, including Cotton, to speak the M\u0101ori language. In April 1842 the Tomatin arrived in Sydney.  The boat was damaged by a rock on entering their landing place and, rather than wait for its repair, some of the party, including Selwyn and Cotton, set sail for New Zealand on the brig Bristolian on 19 May. They arrived in Auckland on 30 May.  After spending some time as guests of Captain William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand, Selwyn and Cotton set sail for the Bay of Islands on the schooner Wave on 12 June, arriving on 20 June.
