The nickname given to him then was Willie Feet due to his unusually large feet.After finishing his secondary education, Will went to work for 'Marple Cyclesport'. Having gained some success whilst racing, Wright was selected to represent Wales at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada in 1994. It was there at the Games that Wright rode his first track competition, having never before ridden the track. He competed in the Games once more, closer to home in Manchester in 2002, but unfortunately fell during the men's points race final after hitting a fallen rider; footage of which can be seen on the BBC Motion Gallery.Will took over 'Bardsley Cycles' at 482 Manchester Road, Stockport, Greater Manchester in the 1990s, which was subsequently renamed 'Will's Wheels' which also sponsors it's eponymous cycling club, 'Will's Wheels Cycling Club'. As well the cycling club, Will's Wheels supports local cycle races by providing prizes which Wright himself has been known to present\nWill retired from competitive cycling to spend time with daughters Emily and Megan, and wife Sarah.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Wright", "response": ["*Will Wright (actor) (1894\u20131962), American character actor in film and TV", "*Will Wright (game designer) (born 1960), co-founder of Maxis, designer of SimCity", "*Will Wright (cyclist) (born 1973), Welsh cyclist"]}, {"page": "Huw Pritchard", "response": [":4th Team Pursuit, 4m25.029, Commonwealth Games (with Paul Sheppard, Will Wright & Joby Ingram-Dodd)"]}, {"page": "Paul Sheppard", "response": [":4th Team Pursuit, 4m25.029, Commonwealth Games (with Huw Pritchard, Will Wright & Joby Ingram-Dodd)"]}, {"page": "Joby Ingram-Dodd", "response": [":4th Team Pursuit, 4m25.029, Commonwealth Games (with Huw Pritchard, Will Wright & Paul Sheppard)"]}, {"page": "Welsh National Road Race Championships", "response": ["| 1993 || Tim Davies || Daniel Wedley || Will Wright ", "| 2002 || Andrew Windsor || Chris Anelay || Will Wright", "| 2005 || Geraint Thomas || Will Wright || Chris Anelay"]}]}}
