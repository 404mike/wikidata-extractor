Watts wrote a book about Pell titled The Fleet Street Sewer Rat, published in 2005. He has been prosecuted himself and was only fined \u00a320,  due to his claim that he lived off a weekly \u00a310 payment from his father despite the estimated \u00a3100,000 a year he was earning from selling documents to newspapers.

Exaro's then-editor-in-chief, Mark Watts, stood by the website's coverage and said they \"never asserted\" that Beech's claims were true, but also called Beech's conviction 'wholly unsafe' because he did not think Beech got a fair trial after the judge had allowed jurors to hear that he had pleaded guilty to child pornography offences in a separate trial."]}, {"page": "Cultural impact of Madonna", "response": ["Stan Hawkins from University of Leeds said that Madonna was the first female solo artist to gain superstar status in the 1980s. Historian Gil Troy confirmed Madonna as \"the 1980's dominant female star\". However, in a point of contrast some American outlets felt that her popularity declined in the next decade, during the 1990s, according to academic Lynn Spigel while Andrew Ferguson argued that her \"real crime\" had been longevity. Overseas, British author Mark Watts writing for academic journal New Theatre Quarterly in 1996, felt that the rise and (perceived) decline of Madonna has gone, so to say, hand-in-hand with that of postmodern theory \u2014 \"but none the less pervasively influential for that\". Before having a career of 10-years, some of those outlet defined Madonna's career as \"veteran\" or as the \"equivalent to five lifetimes in rock-star years\". "]}]}}
