The LCL councillors tried to have the bill watered down to allow merely for government control of AESC for a brief period.Cockburn, p. 121. In the Council, where suffrage was reliant upon wage and property requirements, the ALP only held four seats out of twenty, and only five LCL members supported the nationalisation. Thus, on 7 November, the bill failed to pass and it was not put to the Parliament again until 1946.Cockburn, pp. 119\u2013121. On 6 April, after months of campaigning on Playford's part, he managed to change the mind of MLC Jack Bice, and the bill passed.Cockburn, pp. 123\u2013126.
