However, promotion to the Southern League was denied, as their ground did not meet the criteria set by the league. The following season saw the club have more cup success by winning the Hampshire Senior Cup.Hampshire Senior Cup at the Football Club history Database After a further title win in 2005\u201306 the club were admitted to the Southern League's new Division One South & West.  In the 2008\u201309 season the team finished 20th after a last day win at Windsor & Eton, but after the game were deducted three points for fielding an ineligible player and as a result finished bottom of the table, leaving them facing relegation to the Wessex League.  The club appealed against the decision with The Football Association but lost their case and were relegated for the 2009\u201310 season.

A few days later, Elphick was awarded a two\u2013year contract extension at the club. The day after signing a contract with the club, Elphick made his first league appearance of the season, in a 2\u20131 win over Northampton Town. Elphick's impact in the first team and form earned him praise by Manager Dean Wilkins and formed a partnership throughout the season with Guy Butters and Joel Lynch. From 29 September 2007 to 13 October 2007, Elphick helped the club keep four successive clean sheet in four league matches. In a match against Hartlepool United on 27 October 2007, Elphick was involved in a clash with opposition striker Richie Barker and Barker accused Elphick of \"besmirching the memory of\" Michael Maidens, who died in a car crash weeks ago and following a conclusion to the investigation, he was cleared. However, Elphick suffered a hernia that required a surgery and was sidelined for three weeks, which was soon delayed for another week. Elphick made his return to the first team since returning from injury, in a 3\u20132 win over AFC Bournemouth, in which he stated the game left him bruised and battered. Two weeks later on 19 January 2008, Elphick scored his first professional goal (and his first for the club), in a 1\u20131 draw against Huddersfield Town. Elphick then scored his second goal of the season on 4 March 2008, in a 4\u20132 win over Gillingham. In a match against Nottingham Forest on 24 March 2008, Elphick was given a captaincy armband after their captain Nicky Forster was substituted, which resulted a 0\u20130 draw, in which he said it was honour to wear the captain armband. Then on 11 April 2008, Elphick signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2010.
