Hope Bagenal and his colleagues from the Building Research Station formed an integral part of the design team. The acoustic behaviour of the seats was measured and tested in a laboratory to enable more exacting design. Careful consideration of external noise problems was undertaken."]}, {"page": "English Folk Dance and Song Society", "response": ["The building\u2019s most striking feature is Kennedy Hall, a large concert and performance space with a sprung ballroom floor for dancing.
