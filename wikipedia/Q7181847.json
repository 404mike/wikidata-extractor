He held talks with a number of different consortia and reportedly turned down one offer of a full take over as the bidding consortium wanted to relocate the club to Darlington. Furthermore, he said the speculation had led to instability in the club which was unsettling players and fans alike. On the pitch the Falcons reached another European Challenge Cup quarter-final going down to Saracens away from home and finished 10th in the Premiership.  This season marked the end of an era as legendary fly-half Jonny Wilkinson left the club for RC Toulonnais.  England under-20s fly-half Rory Clegg also left for Harlequins as Jimmy Gopperth was signed as replacement fly-half.  The loss of Wilkinson was compounded by the departure of future British and Irish Lions star Geoff Parling who continued the outflow of talent, leaving for Leicester Tigers.  Another trio who would go on to achieve England honours in Phil Dowson, Dave Wilson and Tom May also left for Northampton Saints, Bath Rugby and RC Toulonnais respectively."]}, {"page": "Northampton Saints", "response": ["*Phil Dowson \u2013 forwards coach"]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*Phil Dowson England rugby union player"]}, {"page": "James Simpson-Daniel", "response": ["He attended Red House School & Sedbergh School in the Yorkshire Dales, which has produced a number of professional rugby union players including Will Greenwood, Will Carling and Phil Dowson, with whom he played alongside in the same XV.
