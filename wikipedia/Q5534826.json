Although ostensibly independent of the British Government, a key member of the Mission was Frank Ashton-Gwatkin, technically on secondment from his official duties at the London Foreign Office.Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 128\u201330. Separate negotiations were held with the Czechoslovak Government and the SdP with a view to achieving a mediated settlement of the dispute. During meetings with the Czechoslovak President, Edvard Bene\u0161, and other government officials, Runciman repeatedly pressed for significant concessions be made to the SdP. Runciman also met Henlein on several occasions but did not subject him to the same pressure for an agreement.Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 243\u201360.
