Blackburn Olympic never played League Football and majored on the FA Cup. Their two successful seasons (and Costley was involved) were 1882\u20131883 and 1883\u20131884. In 1882\u20131883 Blackburn Olympic reached the Final. The date was 31 March 1883 and the venue was Kennington Oval.

The following season, 1883\u20131884, Olympic, as holders, took the defence of the Cup to the Semi\u2013Final. The match was played at Trent Bridge on 1 March 1884 against Queen's Park (Glasgow). Olympic were hoping to win and play their local rivals, Blackburn Rovers who played in, and won, the other Semi\u2013Final. However, Olympic were outclassed by their Scottish opponents and lost 4\u20130. James Costley was signed, by Everton, from Blackburn Olympic in 1886 and was described as a skillful winger and superb dribbler. He did very well in his first two seasons scoring 22 goals from 59 appearances.
