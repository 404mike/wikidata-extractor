He may have been the brother of the composer Antonio Draghi.\nDraghi was brought to London in the 1660s by King Charles II who was trying, unsuccessfully, to establish Italian opera in England.  He remained in England for the rest of his life.\nIn 1673 Draghi was made first organist of the queen's Catholic chapel in Somerset House.  In 1684 he took part in what became known as the Battle of the Organs.  He was hired by master organ maker Renatus Harris to demonstrate the superiority of his organ when Harris was trying to gain the contract to build the new organ for the Temple Church.  Harris' rival \"Father\" Bernard Smith hired organists and composers John Blow and Henry Purcell to demonstrate his organ and won the contest.\nDraghi was awarded a pension by King William III in 1698.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Italian composers", "response": ["*Giovanni Battista Draghi (c. 1640\u20131708), not the later namesake known as Pergolesi", "*Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710\u20131736), born Giovanni Battista Draghi"]}, {"page": "Renatus Harris", "response": ["The rivalry between the two men led to the famous Battle of the Organs in 1684, when both were bidding for the contract to build the new organ for the Temple Church, London.

Harris lost out to Smith, but in 1697, after Smith reneged on a contract for a new organ at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, Harris appositely installed the instrument which had lost there instead. Harris's organ, which was installed and maintained by John Baptist Cuvillie, and later Philip Hollister, was replaced by an organ by John Byfield in 1752. However, the Harris-Cuvillie organ which survived the 'Battle of the Organs' today survives in St John's Church, Wolverhampton."]}, {"page": "Giovanni Battista Draghi", "response": ["*Giovanni Battista Draghi (composer) (c. 1640\u20131708), Italian composer and keyboard player"]}, {"page": "List of Baroque composers", "response": ["* Giovanni Battista Draghi (c. 1640\u20131708)"]}, {"page": "1708 in music", "response": ["*May 13 \u2013 Giovanni Battista Draghi, composer and keyboardist (born c.1640)"]}, {"page": "1707 in music", "response": ["* Giovanni Battista Draghi \u2013 6 Harpsichord Suites"]}, {"page": "Unmeasured prelude", "response": ["The unmeasured harpsichord prelude became a typical French genre, used by many famous composers including Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jean-Henri d'Anglebert, Louis Marchand and \u00c9lisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre.
