He was a left back in the Leeds United team of the 1960s and 1970s, and featured for England at the 1970 Mexico World Cup.

The Brazilian winger sped past left-back Terry Cooper and crossed the ball into the six-yard box, where Pel\u00e9 connected with a powerful header to send the ball low towards the right-hand corner of the goal.

In 1970, Chelsea again reached the FA Cup final and this time faced reigning league champions Leeds United. Over the two fiercely contested matches, Bonetti had what was perhaps the finest moment of his playing career. Chelsea were outplayed for large spells in the first final at Wembley Stadium and he made a series of crucial saves to help them emerge with a 2\u20132 draw. Shortly into the replay at Old Trafford, his left knee was badly injured after a challenge from Leeds' Mick Jones. He returned to the field after treatment, but was effectively playing on one leg for the rest of the match and was powerless to stop Jones scoring the opener a few minutes later. In spite of the injury, and being targeted by the Leeds forwards, he made crucial saves throughout the match, denying both Peter Lorimer and Terry Cooper, and resisted more pressure from Leeds after Chelsea had taken the lead in extra time to help secure a 2\u20131 win. Such were Bonetti's performances that season, he was voted runner-up in the FWA Footballer of the Year awards."]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Charlton developed a new ploy for the 1967\u201368 season by standing next to the goalkeeper during corners to prevent him from coming out to collect the ball; this created havoc for opposition defences and is still a frequently used tactic in the modern era. However, for the second successive season Leeds finished fourth and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals, this time losing 1\u20130 to Everton at Old Trafford. They finally won major honours by beating Arsenal 1\u20130 in the final of the League Cup; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of the game despite allegations that Charlton pushed goalkeeper Jim Furnell in the build-up to the goal. Leeds then went on to lift the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup after beating CA Spora Luxembourg, FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland) and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final with Hungarian club Ferencv\u00e1rosi. They won 1\u20130 at Elland Road and drew 0\u20130 in Budapest to claim their first European trophy.", "He continued to manage and change every aspect of the club, and took the decision to disassemble the club's scouting network to instead focus on local talent in Northumberland and Durham. His only major new signing of the 1974\u201375 season was Terry Cooper, a former Leeds United teammate. They adapted well to the First Division, finishing in seventh place, but would have finished fourth and qualified for Europe had Derby County not scored a last second goal against them on the last day of the season."]}, {"page": "Birmingham City F.C.", "response": ["In April 1989 the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain, bought the club. A rapid turnover of managers, the absence of promised investment, and a threatened mass refusal of players to renew contracts was relieved only by a victorious trip to Wembley in the Associate Members' Cup. Terry Cooper delivered promotion, but the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars' businesses into receivership; in November 1992 BCCI's liquidator put up for sale their 84% holding in the football club."]}, {"page": "Terry", "response": ["* Terry Cooper (footballer, born 1944), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Exeter City F.C.", "response": ["Exeter won their first league title in the 1989\u201390 season, gaining promotion as Fourth Division champions under the stewardship of Terry Cooper. Relegated in 1994, they lost their Football League status at the end of the 2002\u201303 season. They spent five seasons in the Conference, and recovered from defeat in the 2007 play-off final to win promotion out of the play-offs the next year. Manager Paul Tisdale built on this success by winning promotion out of League Two in 2008\u201309 and Exeter survived for three seasons in League One. Returning to League Two in 2012, they have lost in the play-off finals in 2017, 2018 and most recently in 2020, under Matt Taylor.", "Following that promotion, City rarely shone at the higher level. The departure of manager Terry Cooper and key players such as Shaun Taylor, Richard Dryden, Clive Whitehead, Brian McDermott and Steve Neville left new boss Alan Ball to pick up the pieces. There were some successes under the former World Cup winner\u2014including winning both games against local rivals Plymouth in the clubs' first derbies for a decade in the 1992/93 season\u2014but Ball left for Southampton in January 1994 and the returning Cooper was unable to save Exeter from relegation.", "| Terry Cooper", "| Terry Cooper"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Johnstone", "response": ["Johnstone had a morbid fear of flying, which Jock Stein used to great effect on one occasion. Ahead of the first leg of a European tie against Red Star Belgrade at Parkhead in November 1968, Stein told Johnstone that, if Celtic won by four goals, he wouldn't have to travel to Yugoslavia for the second leg. Johnstone went on to produce an outstanding performance, scoring twice and providing assists for the other three goals in a 5\u20131 win. He helped Celtic reach a further European Cup Final in season 1969\u201370. His performance in the second leg of the semi-final against Leeds United at Hampden Park was particularly outstanding, and his mazy run in the second half set up Bobby Murdoch to score with a powerful shot for Celtic's winning goal in a 2\u20131 victory on the night. Leeds' defender Terry Cooper later quipped \"I would love to have kicked Jinky, but I couldn't get near him!\" Billy Bremner described Johnstone's performance as \"one of the greatest exhibitions I have ever seen\", adding that \"Jimmy had one of these games where he was unstoppable.\" Celtic played Feyenoord in the final but, with Johnstone double-marked at all times, Celtic were unable to perform as they had in the 1967 final. Feyenoord dominated the match and defeated Celtic 2\u20131 after extra-time."]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["With his team coming close but failing to land a trophy he brought in a gypsy to lift a curse he believed had been placed on Elland Road so that there would be no bad luck for the 1967\u201368 season. A more practical measure he took to increase United's fortunes was to nearly double the club's record transfer to buy Sheffield United centre-forward Mick Jones for \u00a3100,000, who would replace the frequently injured Peacock as the main striker. Soon after the purchase Leeds recorded a 7\u20130 victory over Chelsea, though ironically Jones was not on the score-sheet. Revie's first trophy would be the League Cup, as they eliminated Luton Town, Bury, Sunderland, Stoke City and Derby County to reach the final against Arsenal; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of what was a dour and tense final as Revie told his players to \"shut up shop\" and defend their 1\u20130 lead. This success did not immediately translate into league and FA Cup success however, as they finished in fourth place and were beaten in the FA Cup semi-finals by Everton. They instead reached a second successive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final, beating CA Spora Luxembourg (Luxembourg), FK Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland), and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final against Hungarian club Ferencv\u00e1rosi. Leeds won the first leg 1\u20130, and a month later defended their lead with a 0\u20130 draw in Budapest, by which time Jimmy Greenhoff, a substitute in the first leg, had been sold to Birmingham City."]}, {"page": "Emlyn Hughes", "response": ["Along with Nobby Stiles, Hughes was one of only two outfield players who did not feature in any game. England progressed to the quarter finals, where they were defeated by West Germany. Questions were raised about Ramsey's decisions during the game. He controversially withdrew Bobby Charlton and Martin Peters in the second half, but retained a clearly exhausted Terry Cooper, who played at left back the entire 120 minutes although Hughes was available to replace him. Hughes would ultimately never play in a World Cup."]}, {"page": "Trevor Cherry", "response": ["Cherry \u2013 along with teammate Roy Ellam \u2013 moved along the M62 in 1972 when Leeds paid \u00a3100,000 to Huddersfield for his services. He ended up playing both alongside and instead of Charlton in his first season but predominantly at left back, replacing broken leg victim Terry Cooper. By the end of the season Cherry had amassed 38 League appearances and was selected by Revie for the 1973 FA Cup final, which Leeds lost to Sunderland."]}, {"page": "Gary Sprake", "response": ["The first of Sprake's two notorious errors came in 1967 when Leeds played Liverpool in a League game at Anfield. Sprake was holding the ball and was set to throw it to the Leeds left back Terry Cooper, only to curtail his throw when he spotted Liverpool winger Ian Callaghan running towards the area he planned to throw the ball. Unfortunately for Sprake, the ball slipped out of his hands behind him and ended up in the net. At half-time, the Liverpool tannoy-announcer played \"Careless Hands\", a record by Des O'Connor, apparently in reference to Sprake's mistake, and during the second half Liverpool supporters on the Kop sang the song repeatedly to Sprake. During his time at Leeds, fans of rival clubs gave Sprake the nickname \"Careless Hands\" as a result."]}, {"page": "Ray Wilson (English footballer)", "response": ["A serious knee injury suffered in the summer of 1968, coupled with the emergence of young Leeds United full-back Terry Cooper (who would be as impressive in the 1970 World Cup as Wilson was in 1966, despite England's elimination in the last eight), ended Wilson's England career."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Greenhoff", "response": ["Once again, they finished fourth in the First Division in 1967\u201368, five points behind champions Manchester City.

He went on to appear in the League Cup final in 1968 after recovering from a knee injury; United beat Arsenal 1\u20130 thanks to a twenty-yard strike from Terry Cooper. Greenhoff went on to score four of Leeds' nineteen goals past minnows CA Spora Luxembourg in the 1967\u201368 instalment of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. He also appeared as a half-time substitute in the first leg of the final, a 1\u20130 home win over Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC, which was enough to secure Leeds the trophy after a goalless draw in Budapest. Greenhoff played a total of 136 games for Leeds in league and cup, scoring 36 goals."]}]}}
