He found that Fletcher's locomotives, although good, did not use standardised components. McDonnell decided that in future, locomotives would use shared standard parts where possible, and that locomotive design and construction would utilise the practices which he had used at Inchicore. His first locomotive design for the NER, the '38' class 4-4-0, incorporated a number of unpopular features; and some popular features of Fletcher's engines were omitted. Worse, although the new locomotives were larger than Fletcher's most recent designs, they were no more capable. His only other design for the NER, the '59' class 0-6-0, were also unpopular; in this case, the engines were of similar size to Fletcher's most recent 0-6-0, but were less powerful. As a consequence, McDonnell resigned from the NER in September 1884, receiving a year's salary as severance pay. McDonnell was not replaced immediately, the NER's locomotive department then being managed by a committee chaired by Henry Tennant."]}, {"page": "NER 38 Class", "response": ["McDonnell set about designing a new class of express passenger locomotives, which incorporated a number of departures from established NER practice. Some of these were significant, such as the use of a leading bogie on an express locomotive; others were purely cosmetic, such as the shape of the chimney. The biggest change was that the driving position was placed on the left-hand side of the cab, instead of the right \u2013 the drivers did not like this change at all, and found fault with most of the other unfamiliar features. So much pressure was put on McDonnell that he resigned in September 1884. Despite this, uncompleted orders were allowed to stand, apart from the last batch of eight which were cancelled; components which had already been manufactured for these were incorporated into some 0-6-0T locomotives which Henry Tennant's locomotive committee designed; these became the '8' class (LNER J74)."]}, {"page": "George Gibb", "response": ["In 1882, Gibb joined the North Eastern Railway (NER) as a solicitor and was soon acting as assistant to general manager Henry Tennant.
