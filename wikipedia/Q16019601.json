Weston recalled that he filmed one sequence without air-holes in his suit, risking asphyxiation. \"Even when the tank was feeding air into the suit, there was no place for the carbon dioxide Weston exhaled to go. So it simply built up inside, incrementally causing a heightened heart rate, rapid breathing, fatigue, clumsiness, and eventually, unconsciousness.\" Weston said Kubrick was warned \"we've got to get him back\" but reportedly replied, \"Damn it, we just started. Leave him up there! Leave him up there!\" When Weston lost consciousness, filming ceased, and he was brought down. \"They brought the tower in, and I went looking for Stanley,... I was going to shove MGM right up his... And the thing is, Stanley had left the studio and sent Victor [Lyndon, the associate producer] to talk to me.\" Weston claimed Kubrick fled the studio for \"two or three days.\u00a0...
