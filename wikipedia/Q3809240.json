In the same publication, he maintained P. neohibernicus as another variety of P. melanopogon, as it was initially described in 1876. Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen wrote in 1912 that P. neohibernicus was not a variety of P. melanopogon. He also said that he believed that Peters had the wrong type locality for the specimen he used to describe P. degener. The locality was given as the Aru Islands, but Andersen believed the specimen came from the Bismarck Archipelago. In 1889, British zoologist Oldfield Thomas described Pteropus coronatus from a specimen collected on Mioko Island. However, Andersen noted that it was an immature great flying fox with an unusually pronounced and well-defined \"T\"-shaped dark patch of fur on its head, and thus P. coronatus was a synonym of P. neohibernicus. Pteropus papuanus, described in 1881 by Peters and Italian naturalist Giacomo Doria, was maintained as a separate species by Andersen, though he noted that the only real difference between the two taxa was that P. neohibernicus had paler fur on its back. American biologist Colin Campbell Sanborn described P. sepikensis in 1931 from a specimen collected near the Sepik River in northeastern New Guinea. In 1954, British mammalogists Eleanor Mary Ord Laurie and John Edwards Hill published that they considered Pteropus papuanus a subspecies of the great flying fox, Pteropus neohibernicus papuanus, and that P. sepikensis should be tentatively regarded as a subspecies of P. melanopogon. In 1979, American zoologist Karl Koopman published that he found no differences between P. n. papuanus or P. m. sepikensis and P. n. neohibernicus, and thus, both should be regarded as synonyms of P. n. neohibernicus."]}, {"page": "Hills' horseshoe bat", "response": ["Hills' horseshoe bat was first described as a new subspecies of Geoffroy's horseshoe bat with a trinomen of Rhinolophus clivosus hillorum in 1989.

In 1994, Karl Koopman considered rufus itself to be part of the Middle Eastern and mainland African species Triaenops persicus, a possibility Hill had discussed,Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, p.\u00a047; Benda and Vallo, 2009, table\u00a01 but most authors regarded the two as distinct species.Benda and Vallo, 2009, p.\u00a07 In 2006, Julie Ranivo and Steven Goodman revised Madagascan Triaenops and found little variation among specimens of T.\u00a0rufus from throughout the dry parts of the island.Ranivo and Goodman, 2007, pp.\u00a0963, 975 Three years later, they published another paper which showed that the original material of T.\u00a0rufus and T.\u00a0humbloti was distinct from Madagascan specimens identified as \"Triaenops rufus\" and more similar to T.\u00a0persicus.Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, p.\u00a052 On his journey to Madagascar, Humblot had stayed in Somalia and Yemen, and Goodman and Ranivo concluded that he had probably collected the Triaenops there, after which their provenance was incorrectly recorded.Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, pp.\u00a052\u201353 Thus, rufus and humbloti cannot be used for the Madagascan species, and Goodman and Ranivo proposed the new name Triaenops menamena for the species formerly known as T.\u00a0rufus. The specific name menamena is Malagasy for \"reddish\", referring to the animal's coloration.Goodman and Ranivo, 2009, p.\u00a054 \"Rufous trident bat\" has been used as a common name for Triaenops rufus."]}, {"page": "Shortridge's long-fingered bat", "response": ["Shortridge's long-fingered bat (Miniopterus shortridgei) is a bat in the genus Miniopterus which occurs throughout Indonesia.Page 522, Mammal species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference, Volume 1 By Don E.
