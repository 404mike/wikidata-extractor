(12 April 1914 \u2013 23 August 2013) was a British cinematographer, best known for his work on films such as Dr. Strangelove, A Hard Day's Night (both 1964), Repulsion (1965), The Omen (1976), and Star Wars (1977). In the course of his career, he collaborated with directors like Roman Polanski, Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, and Mike Hodges. He was nominated for two BAFTA Awards, and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Society of Cinematographers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dr. Strangelove", "response": ["Dr. Strangelove was filmed at Shepperton Studios, near London, as Sellers was in the middle of a divorce at the time and unable to leave England. The sets occupied three main sound stages: the Pentagon War Room, the B-52 Stratofortress bomber and the last one containing both the motel room and General Ripper's office and outside corridor.  The studio's buildings were also used as the Air Force base exterior. The film's set design was done by Ken Adam, the production designer of several James Bond films (at the time he had already worked on Dr. No). The black and white cinematography was by Gilbert Taylor, and the film was edited by Anthony Harvey and an uncredited Kubrick. The original musical score for the film was composed by Laurie Johnson and the special effects were by Wally Veevers. The opening theme is an instrumental version of \"Try a Little Tenderness\". The theme of the chorus from the bomb run scene is a modification of \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\". Sellers and Kubrick got along well during the film's production and shared a love of photography."]}, {"page": "Star Wars (film)", "response": ["Lucas tried \"to get a cohesive reality\" for his feature. Since the film is a fairy tale, as he had described, \"I still wanted it to have an ethereal quality, yet be well composed and, also, have an alien look.\" He designed the film to have an \"extremely bizarre, Gregg Toland-like surreal look with strange over-exposed colors, a lot of shadows, a lot of hot areas.\" Lucas wanted Star Wars to embrace the combination of \"strange graphics of fantasy\" and \"the feel of a documentary\" to impress a distinct look. To achieve this, he hired the British cinematographer Gilbert Taylor. Originally, Lucas's first choice for the position was Geoffrey Unsworth, who also provided the cinematography for 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unsworth was interested in working with the director, and initially accepted the job when it was offered to him by Lucas and Kurtz. He eventually withdrew to work on the Vincente Minnelli-directed A Matter of Time (1976) instead, which \"really annoy[ed]\" Kurtz. Lucas called up for other cinematographers, and eventually chose Taylor, basing his choice on Taylor's cinematography for Dr. Strangelove and A Hard Day's Night (both 1964). On his decision, Lucas said: \"I thought they were good, eccentrically photographed pictures with a strong documentary flavor.\"", "The Elstree sets designed by John Barry, according to Gilbert Taylor, \"were like a coal mine.\" He said that \"they were all black and gray, with really no opportunities for lighting at all.\" To resolve the problem, he worked the lighting into the sets by chopping in its walls, ceiling and floors. This would result in \"a 'cut-out' system of panel lighting\", with quartz lamps that could be placed in the holes in the walls, ceiling and floors. His idea was supported by the Fox studio, which agreed that \"we couldn't have this 'black hole of Calcutta. The lighting approach Taylor devised \"allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting, which gave him more freedom.\" In total, the filming in Britain took 14-and-a-half weeks.", "The Death Star assault scene was modeled after the World War II film The Dam Busters (1955), in which Royal Air Force Lancaster bombers fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim bouncing bombs at dams, to cripple the heavy industry of Germany's Ruhr region. Some of the dialogue in The Dam Busters is repeated in the Star Wars climax; Gilbert Taylor also filmed the special effects sequences in The Dam Busters. In addition, the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film 633 Squadron (1964), directed by Walter Grauman, in which RAF de Havilland Mosquitos attack a German heavy water plant by flying down a narrow fjord to drop special bombs at a precise point, while avoiding anti-aircraft guns and German fighters. Clips from both films were included in Lucas's temporary dogfight footage version of the sequence.Zito, Stephen (April 1977). \"George Lucas Goes Far Out\". American Film.

Boyd worked to incorporate lighting into the show's recurring sets, much like Gilbert Taylor's work on Star Wars twenty years prior.
