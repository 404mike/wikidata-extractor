William Digby was a friend of the Bihar barrister-politician Syed Hasan Imam once the leader of the Indian National Congress. His father was Kenelm George Digby, a judge of the Indian High Court, and his mother was Violet M. Kidd, an accomplished painter. As his father was a friend of J. F. Roxburgh, the first headmaster of Stowe School, Digby was sent to that school (1946\u20131951) after attending a preparatory school in North Wales. In 1951 he went with his mother on a painting expedition to Delhi, Rajasthan and Kashmir. On his return to Britain he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, (Major and Senior Scholar, Earl of Derby Student),1951\u20131956; History Tripos, University of Cambridge (1st Class Honours with Distinction) 1956; B.A. (Cantab.) 1956, proceeded M.A. 1962; .'Simon Digby: scholar, writer, linguist and collector' Obituary in The Times 27 January 2010"]}, {"page": "Violet M. Digby", "response": ["Kenelm George Digby became friendly with the Kidd family in the south of France while on furlough from India where his family had served for several generations. He proposed many times to Violet who finally accepted him in 1926 while on the rebound from a long and turbulent relationship that ended badly. Violet Digby returned to the lifestyle of a senior Memsahib of the Raj and went back to painting as her leisure pursuit. About a dozen paintings of Central Provinces and the South of France survive from this period, many paintings were lost on her return from India after the World War Two. She gave birth to a daughter Venetia in 1930 who died in her first year. Her son Simon was born in 1932. Her interest in art and painting continued to develop. In 1939 she studied with Andr\u00e9 Strauss at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts summer school in Fontainebleau.  She spent much of the Second World War in India, concerned with the 'Hospitality League' organising holidays for British soldiers and sailors based in the east.Women in India (quarterly), Vol 1, No.4 pp 38-40.
