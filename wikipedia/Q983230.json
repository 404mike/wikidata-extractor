In Breaking and Entering, Binoche played a Bosnian refugee living in London, while Jude Law co-starred as a well-to-do businessman drawn into her life via an act of deception. In preparation for her role, Binoche traveled to Sarajevo where she met women who had survived the war of the 1990s. Lushly photographed by Beno\u00eet Delhomme, Breaking and Entering portrays intersecting lives amongst the flux of urban renewal in inner-city London. Despite the fact that Binoche was praised for her performance, the film did not ring true for critics and failed to find an audience.Breaking and Entering Movie Reviews, Pictures. Rotten Tomatoes.
