She performed in the former city's first professional season.She had much of her training in France where she studied with Marco Bordogni, Giovanni Tadolini and Claude Thomas Thillon, conductor of the Havre Philharmonic Society, whom she married. After appearances in the provinces, she made her debut at the Paris Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance in 1838 in the title role of Albert Grisar's Lady Melvil. In 1840 she moved to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique where she created the roles of Catarina in Les diamants de la couronne (1841) and Casilda in La part du diable (1843) by Daniel Auber, who had a passion for her. She made her English debut in 1844 at the London Princess's Theatre, repeating the role of Catarina. She later sang at the Drury Lane creating Stella in Balfe's The Enchantress. Her American career began in 1851 but she retired four years later.\nAround 1840\u20131855, the artist Henry Willard painted an oil portrait of her.After her relatively early retirement she lived in the English seaside town of Torquay (census records) and died there as a widow at 84. There is no record of any children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "La fille du r\u00e9giment", "response": ["La fille du r\u00e9giment received its first performance in America on 7 March 1843 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orl\u00e9ans in New Orleans.Loewenberg 1978, column 805; Warrack & West 1992, p. 243.

The Spirit of the Times (22 July) counted it a great success, and, although the score was \"thin\" and not up to the level of Anna Bolena or L'elisir d'amore, some of Donizetti's \"gems\" were to be found in it.Lawrence, 1988, p. 215. The Herald (21 July) was highly enthusiastic, especially in its praise of Calv\u00e9: \"Applause is an inadequate term, ... vehement cheering rewarded this talented prima donna.\"Quoted in Lawrence, 1988, p. 215. Subsequently the opera was performed frequently in New York, the role of Marie being a favorite with Jenny Lind, Henriette Sontag, Pauline Lucca, Anna Thillon and Adelina Patti.Kobb\u00e9 1919, p. 355; Lawrence 1995, p. 226 (Anna Thillon)."]}, {"page": "Les diamants de la couronne", "response": ["|Anna Thillon"]}, {"page": "John Orlando Parry", "response": ["In 1842 he forsook the stage for the concert-room, and was singing, with Anna Thillon and Josef Staudigl, in pieces written expressly for him by Albert Smith.Athen\u00e6um, 10 June 1843, p. 556 Parry afterwards accompanied Camillo Sivori, Franz Liszt, Sigismund Thalberg, and others in a concert tour through the United Kingdom, and his powers as a pianist and his originality as a buffo vocalist were widely recognised. In 1849 Albert Smith wrote an entertainment entitled Notes Vocal and Instrumental, which Parry produced on 25 June 1850 at the Store Street Music Hall, Bedford Square, London, and illustrated with large water-colour paintings executed by himself. In it he indulged in monologue, sang in different voices, played the piano, and made rapid changes of his dress. The entertainment proved more acceptable to the audience than any single-handed performance since the time of Charles Mathews the elder. He was afterwards seen at Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate Street, at Willis's Rooms, King Street, St. James's, and in the provinces. On 17 August 1852 he brought out a new solo entertainment at Store Street, called The Portfolio for Children of all Ages,Sunday Times, 23 May 1852, p. 3 which he continued with much success until August 1853.Athen\u00e6um, 13 August 1853, p. 970 The strain of this engagement, however, proved excessive, and for a time he suffered from mental derangement.

At the Op\u00e9ra she became the leading lady in Rossini's French productions Mo\u00efse et Pharaon, Le Si\u00e8ge de Corinthe, Le Comte Ory, Guillaume Tell, and she also took part in the creation of, notably, Auber's La Muette de Portici and Meyerbeer's Robert le diable. In 1836, when she felt that the rising star of Cornelie Falcon might undermine her leading position at the Op\u00e9ra, she moved to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique where she appeared in new operas by Auber (L'Ambassadrice and Le Domino noir). She left the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1841 when Auber broke his promise to entrust her with the leading role in his new opera Les Diamants de la couronne, giving it instead to Anna Thillon, for whom he had a passion.Jean Gourret: Histoire de l'op\u00e9ra-comique (Paris: Publications universitaires, 1978), pp. 111 and 116.
