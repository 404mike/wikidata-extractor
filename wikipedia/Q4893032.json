O'Flanagan was sent to Cliffoney at the end of July 1914, shortly before the start of WW1. O'Flanagan, a widely travelled curate with strong nationalist, socialist and republican ideals, may have been moved by Bishop Bernard Coyne for his support of the Sligo Dock Strike in May 1913. One of O'Flanagan's first initiatives was to write to Colonel Ashley of Classiebawn Castle, and he secured the old school house as a community hall for the villagers.", "The Roman Catholic church is dedicated to Saint Molaise from Inishmurray island. The church was opened in 1828, replacing an older structure called Teampeall Bui down the hill and close to Saint Briget's well. Cliffoney church was closed for an extensive period in 1915 when the whole village united in protest against the Bishop of Elphin, Dr. Bernard Coyne, who had removed Fr. Michael O'Flanagan. The protest which was widely reported in the newspapers, continued for ten weeks until Christmas Eve 1915.In October Fr O'Flanagan was transferred by his Bishop to the parish of Crossna, County Roscommom. His parishioners saw this as punishment for his involvement with the bog dispute and did not take kindly to the move. They locked up the church at Cliffony and refused to hand over the key to the new curate, Fr McHugh. This dispute continued until Christmas Day 1915. On that morning the key to Cliffony church was handed to the Parish Priest. The people meanwhile were presumably enjoying the warmth of the C.D.B. turf.

On 19 October Bishop Clancy died, and his successor, Dr. Bernard Coyne was a conservative who seems to have resented O'Flanagan's perceived modernism and independence, and their relationship was to be a poor one.", "In late July 1914 the Bishop Bernard Coyne transferred O'Flanagan to Cliffoney, a small village in the parish of Ahamlish in north county Sligo. He had instructions from the bishop to assist the ailing priest, help the faltering lace industry in Cliffoney, and to look for land or a building for a village hall. Initially he rented a Lodge in Mullaghmore before eventually moving up to Cliffoney where he rented a cottage from Mrs. Hannan.", "O'Flanagan's fiery speech was recorded by the RIC and widely reported in the national press. Upon his return to Crossna he was sanctioned by Bishop Coyne, who sent O\"Flanagan a letter on 14 January 1916 stating:I regret exceedingly that I find it necessary - in the interests of religion, ecclesiastical discipline and good order - to withdraw from you as I do hereby and until further notice, permission to preach anywhere in this diocese: - as also to celebrate mass outside the parish of Ardcarne without my permission in writing......Letter from Bishop Bernard Coyne to Fr.

Dear Father O'Flanagan, I regret exceedingly that I find it necessary - in the interests of religion, ecclesiastical discipline and good order - to withdraw from you as I do hereby and until further notice, permission to preach anywhere in this diocese: - as also to celebrate mass outside the parish of Ardcarne without my permission in writing. I also forbid you \"sub poena suspensiouis\" - to harangue the congregation, on any subject, inside or in the vicinity of the church or station house; or to speak publicly and disparagingly of your brother priests or ecclesiastical superiors. In this connection and in view of the recent grave public scandals with which your name has been so painfully and notoriously associated, I desire to direct your most serious attention to the Eccommunicto speciali modo R. P. reservata (No. 4. Appendix II. P. 50 aeta et deciu Con. Prov. Tuam.) Finally I must forbid you to deliver any public lecture or address, or to remain a night outside the parish of Ardcarne without my special permission in writing. Praying to God to grant you the grace to apply your energies and talents - after the noble example of so many of your brother priests - to the practical and edifying work of the mission. I remain your grieved and afflicted Bishop, Signed Bernard Coyne. The letter concluded, \"I remain your grieved and afflicted Bishop, signed Bernard Coyne.\"", "Noting these preparations Bishop Coyne issued a warning by letter to O'Flanagan on 21 January 1917, beginning \"In view of the present political unrest in part of the country, and to prevent any misunderstanding in the future, I would like to call your attention to the following statute on the national Synod of Maynooth (Page 121, No. 379).\" Citing four statutes in Latin the Bishop's letter concludes: \"Non-compliance with the terms of these statutes will mean, in your case, an \"ipso facto\" suspension, and deprivation of the ordinary faculties of the diocese.
