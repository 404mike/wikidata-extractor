His opponent was Chapman, who received a start of 50,000 and scored 926 before Reece commenced his break. Reece managed to get the balls in position for cradle cannons after scoring 825 points, and was in play for 85 hours and 49 minutes for his break, averaging 97 points a minute. As billiards is a turn-based sport, Chapman did not get to play any shots during this time. During the match, at Burroughes Hall, Reece made 249,552 cradle cannons during his break. The Billiards Association decided at a meeting on 2 September 1907 to ban the cradle cannon, although as no consensus on the definition of a cradle cannon was reached, the responsibility to determine whether a player was playing cradle cannons was passed to match referees. The president of the Association, Sydenham Dixon, said during the meeting that \"the stroke had been mastered by certain professionals and persisted in to an extent that made it farcical\". The world record break under the current rules is 1,346 by Peter Gilchrist."]}, {"page": "Singapore at the 2006 Asian Games", "response": ["|  || Peter Gilchrist || Cue sports || Men's English billiards singles||5", "*Peter Gilchrist", "*Peter Gilchrist, Puan Teik Chong Alan", "*E Boon Aun Keith, Peter Gilchrist", "*E Boon Aun Keith, Peter Gilchrist"]}, {"page": "IBSF World Billiards Championship", "response": ["| 2019 || Mandalay (Long-Up) ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Praprut Chaithanasakun || 1000\u2013732", "| 2016 || India (150-Up) ||  Pankaj Advani ||  Peter Gilchrist || 6\u20133", "| 2016 || India (Long-Up) ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Sourav Kothari || 1500\u2013617", "| 2015 || Adelaide (timed) ||  Pankaj Advani ||  Peter Gilchrist ||2408\u20131240", "| 2015 || Adelaide (150-Up) ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  Pankaj Advani || 6\u20134", "| 2014 || England (150-up) ||  Pankaj Advani ||  Peter Gilchrist || 6\u20132", "| 2013 || England (Long-Up) ||  Peter Gilchrist ||  David Causier || 1500\u20131085", "| 2010 || Maharashtra (timed) ||  Mike Russell ||  Peter Gilchrist || 4120\u2013784"]}, {"page": "World Billiards Championship (English billiards)", "response": ["David Causier (with six titles), Pankaj Advani (three titles), and Peter Gilchrist are other multiple title winners in the modern game.", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|bgcolor=\"FFFFFF\"| Peter Gilchrist"]}, {"page": "Billiards and snooker at the 2007 Southeast Asian Games", "response": ["|Keith E Boon AunPeter GilchristLim Chun Kiat"]}, {"page": "2008 World Professional Billiards Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|style=\"text-align:left\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|style=\"text-align:left\"| Peter Gilchrist", "|style=\"text-align:left; background:#aaffaa\"| Peter Gilchrist"]}, {"page": "Subhash Agarwal", "response": ["Subhash Agarwal is an Indian professional player and coach of English billiards and snooker.
