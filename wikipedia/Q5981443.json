On 27 October 2009, Leeds recalled him, with current number one goalkeeper Shane Higgs out with a thigh injury and loanee goalkeeper Frank Fielding having returned to his parent club. Martin expected to be the back-up keeper for Casper Ankergren. Martin was regularly on the bench whilst Higgs was out injured, but he was displaced versus Oldham Athletic with David Martin having arrived on loan from Liverpool. However, Martin returned as a Leeds substitute versus Huddersfield Town, as Leeds already had five loan players in the squad and David Martin was therefore unable to be included."]}, {"page": "Tom Bender (footballer)", "response": ["On 4 October 2011, Bender was involved in a three-way collision in a match in the 39th minute between Ian Dunbavin of Accrington Stanley and Lucas Akins of Tranmere Rovers in a Football League Trophy match between the two teams.
