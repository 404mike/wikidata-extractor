Scottish goalkeeper George Wilcock, who had joined the club just a year earlier, was sold to struggling First Division side Preston North End in May 1920, where he made seven appearances in the top flight before dropping out of league football at the end of the season. He was replaced by former Sunderland goalkeeper Tommy Allen, who was brought to The Dell for free after his former club \"had forgotten to include [him] on their end-of-season retained list\". Centre-forward George Jones, another recent signing who had scored five goals in seven appearances in the club's last Southern League campaign, joined Yorkshire non-league side Goole Town. Arthur Andrews, who had established his place at right-half the previous year, was forced to retire from professional football following a broken leg in January, with Southampton releasing him at the end of the season.", "!scope=\"row\"|Arthur Andrews"]}]}}
