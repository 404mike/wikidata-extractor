A creative midfielder, he made over 500 appearances in a 17 year playing career in the Premier League, Football League and Football Conference. He is currently assistant head coach at West Bromwich Albion.\nAn England U20 international, he turned professional at Derby County, making his Premier League debut in April 1999. He played 62 games in six seasons at Derby, including 32 Premier League matches, but struggled with alcoholism and spent four weeks in recovery at the Priory Hospital. He spent time on loan at Mansfield Town (winning promotion out of the Third Division in 2001\u201302) and Kidderminster Harriers, before leaving Derby in November 2003. He had brief non-contract spells at Notts County and Burton Albion, before seeing out the 2003\u201304 season with Kidderminster Harriers. He signed with Mansfield Town in June 2004, moving on to Carlisle United in March 2005. He helped Carlisle to win promotion back into the Football League through the Conference National play-offs in 2005 and then to win the League Two title in 2005\u201306, whilst also reaching the 2006 Football League Trophy final. He joined Torquay United for a \u00a310,000 fee in August 2006 and was sold on to Macclesfield Town for \u00a317,500 in January 2007. He returned to the Conference Premier upon joining Oxford United in January 2008.\nHe spent two-and-a-half seasons at Oxford, and was club captain for much of his 97 appearances, though missed the second half of the 2009\u201310 campaign and the subsequent 2010 play-off final victory due to injury. He remained in the Conference Premier, signing with Luton Town in July 2010. Three months later he was loaned out to Mansfield Town in a deal which was made permanent in January 2011. He would spend four-and-a-half seasons with Mansfield, taking his final tally with the club over his four different spells to 211 games and 24 goals. He featured on the losing side in the 2011 FA Trophy Final and was named as the club's Player of the Season as Mansfield won promotion into the Football League as champions of the Conference Premier in 2012\u201313. He had short loan spells at Rainworth Miners Welfare and Worksop Town after falling out of favour in 2013. He retired from playing at the end of the 2014\u201315 season, though briefly came out of retirement to play for Sutton Coldfield in 2018.\nHe was appointed as Mansfield Town's assistant manager whilst still a player and became caretaker-manager in November 2014. He got the job permanently the following month, aged just 33, and went on to keep the club in League Two with a 21st-place finish. A 12th-place finish followed in the 2015\u201316 season, before he quit the club in November 2016. He was appointed Boston United manager the next month, taking the club to a 15th-place finish in the National League North at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. He resigned in October 2017 and was named as assistant manager at Guiseley the following month.
