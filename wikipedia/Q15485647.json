He then turned to film journalism, and has written for such publications as Daily Mail, Empire, Total Film, The Independent, SFX and Cinema Retro. Sellers has conducted interviews with such notable persons as Roger Moore, Christopher Lee, Michael Palin, Richard Dreyfuss and Ray Harryhausen.\nApart from biographies, Sellers had also written books on the entertainment industry. His book Very Naughty Boys: The Amazing True Story of HandMade Films, the inside story of the British film company HandMade Films, was described by Film Review magazine as \"fascinating\" and \"impossible to put down\".\nCult TV is the official history of ITC, Lew Grade's television company that made hit TV shows throughout the 1960s and 70s.\nSellers has contributed to a number of television documentaries including Channel 4's The 100 Best Family Films.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons", "response": ["Commentators have drawn parallels with the state of international relations at the time the series was made. Robert Sellers writes that Captain Scarlet arose from \"1960s sci-fi obsession with alien forces infiltrating society\", which he suggests were derived from fears about the Cold War and communism.Sellers, p.\u00a0101. For Nicholas J. Cull, the \"war of nerves\" between Earth and Mars is a reflection of contemporary geopolitical conflict, while the \"enemy within\" scenario of Martians taking over human beings is comparabe to plots of films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956). Mark Bould argues that the series \"seemed in tune with a decade of civil disobedience and anti-imperialist guerrilla wars\" \u2013 a view echoed by Rebecca Feasey of the University of Edinburgh, who regards it as one of several series that \"exploited the fears of 1960s America\" in its portrayal of \"civil disobedience and the potentially negative impact of new technologies\". Since 2001, comparisons have also been made to the September 11 attacks and the ensuing War on Terror.Sellers, p.\u00a0102. Sangster and Condon argue that for a 1960s series, Captain Scarlet was \"incredibly perceptive\" in its conception of the Mysterons, whose tactics they liken to terrorism."]}, {"page": "Stingray (1964 TV series)", "response": ["Writing in 2006, Robert Sellers described Stingray as the \"first truly classic Anderson show\", whose special effects \"have stood the test of time remarkably well.\"Sellers, p.\u00a092. Daniel O'Brien, author of SF:UK: How British Science Fiction Changed the World, considers it to be \"perhaps the archetypal Gerry Anderson series\".O'Brien, p.\u00a081. Ranking the Anderson productions, Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy places Stingray fourth, calling it \"a kids' adventure serial of the highest order\". Andrew Blair of Den of Geek believes that when grouped with Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Stingray is \"the lesser of the Holy Triumvirate of Supermarionation [...] It's shorter than the former, and lighter than the latter, giving it a comparatively breezy feel.\" He also describes it as \"inherently a matinee adventure, an inspiring rush of mild peril and jaunty escapades\"."]}, {"page": "Passport to Pimlico", "response": ["According to the film historian Robert Sellers, Passport to Pimlico \"captures the most quintessential English traits of individualism, tolerance and compromise\"; Duguid sees the examination of the English character as being \"at the heart\" of the film. This was one of the aspects that appealed to Margaret Rutherford, who liked the way the British were portrayed \"accentuating their individuality and decency, while acknowledging some parochial idiosyncracies\"."]}, {"page": "Oliver Reed", "response": ["Reed often described himself as a British patriot and preferred to live in the United Kingdom over relocating to Hollywood.

Starburst magazine calls Penelope one of the series' \"best-loved characters\". According to Angus Allan, Penelope and Parker \"became a cult in themselves.\" Commenting on the Thunderbirds cast, writer John Peel singles out Penelope for particular praise, referring to her as the \"one character in the show who positively shone\". He approves of her characterisation as a secret agent obliged to play the role of a \"bored aristocrat\", identifying parallels with male literary characters such as James Bond, Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel. Commentator Bill Osgerby argues that Penelope and Parker were added to the series to \"play up to American perceptions of the British class system\", noting Penelope's status as an \"aristocratic amateur\" in contrast with the \"meritocratic professionals\" embodied by the Tracy men. He also describes the character as a \"pop feminist\" and  an \"emblem of Swinging Sixties femininity\", comparing her to Emma Peel and Modesty Blaise. Considering Penelope and Parker to be \"amongst the most popular and recognisable TV characters ever created\", Robert Sellers comments that they \"[stole] the show\", with Penelope in particular \"following in the liberated footsteps of Cathy Gale and Emma Peel.\""]}, {"page": "Aloysius Parker", "response": ["The puppet character is known for his Cockney speech, which he would often hypercorrect by adding non-standard aitches in an attempt to imitate prestigious English. He is also remembered for his frequent use of the expression \"Yes, M'Lady\" in acknowledging Penelope's instructions. Commentators Jim Sangster and Paul Condon write that the character's \"adenoidal\" delivery of this line \"became synonymous with the show.\" They also describe Penelope and Parker as the \"best characters in the Anderson collection\", stating that the duo \"managed to steal every episode they appeared in.\" Robert Sellers describes Parker and Penelope together as \"amongst the most popular and recognisable TV characters ever created\"."]}, {"page": "The Battle for Bond", "response": ["The Battle for Bond (2007), by Robert Sellers, is a cinema history book of how the literary character James Bond metamorphosed to the cinema James Bond.

In 2007, Thunderbirds came 19th in a Radio Times poll for the best science fiction TV programme of all time, and in 2013, it was ranked fourth in the Channel 5 list show 50 Greatest Kids' TV Shows.

According to Reed's biographer Robert Sellers, Reed only bought the house because he wanted a field to keep his horse in, but then spent a fortune renovating it. The naked wrestling scene with Reed and Alan Bates in Ken Russell's 1969 film Women in Love is said to have been filmed there. Reed was banned from his local pub there for descending a chimney naked and shouting out: \"Ho! Ho! Ho!
