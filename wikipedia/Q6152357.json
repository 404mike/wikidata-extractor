The beleaguered but spirited protagonist's emotions are suppressed, hinted at, and beautifully described in a series of stories within stories built on shifting realities as deception is met with counter-deception.

", "*Daisy Goodwin in The Sunday Times has described it as, \"Like a Hitchcock film, every detail is there for a reason ... It is rare to read a literary novel where the storytelling is as skilful as the writing is fine, but in Gillespie and I, Harris has pulled off the only too rare double whammy \u2013 a Booker-worthy novel that I want to read again.\"Gillespie and I by Jane Harris | The Sunday Times Retrieved 2019-01-27.", "*Kirkus Reviews concludes \"Harris writes sensitively and in rich detail, whether conjuring up a Glaswegian streetscape or the elements of one of Ned\u2019s compositions. The imbroglio that she conjures up for the Gillespies is something of a potboiler, involving white slavery, unlawful carnal knowledge and Satanism. Or perhaps not: as Harriet complains, \u201cIt is incredible what the newspapers are able to get away with printing.\u201d The narrative holds up well to the very end, though the reader will have to have the ability to wend his or her way through the leisurely sentences appropriate to the time and place. A fine evocation of a lost era, and without a false note.\"GILLESPIE AND I by Jane Harris | Kirkus Reviews Retrieved 2019-01-27.", "*Clare Clark in The Guardian compares it with Harris' debut novel: \"Gillespie and I, while less strikingly original than The Observations, has much of its pace and verve. Harris is a fine storyteller and controls the twists and turns of her plot well. Like Bessy Buckley, Harriet Baxter is an arch manipulator, and while she has none of Buckley's reckless exuberance, she shares her predecessor's acuity and has a sly and waspish wit\". And continues, \"Like The Observations, Gillespie and I is, at heart, a book about loneliness and obsessive love. If The Observations drew on Gothic romance and sensation fiction for its inspiration, Gillespie and I follows the tradition of Henry James, using the first-person narrator to explore questions of consciousness and perception. Harriet Baxter is an uncomfortable mixture of superiority and neediness and, while the intensity of her friendship with the Gillespies is oppressive, it is, at least at the start, impossible to fault. Harriet is not a likeable narrator but she is a compelling one.Gillespie and I by Jane Harris \u2013 review | Books | The Guardian Retrieved 2019-01-27.", "*Carol Birch in The Independent writes, \"Harris plays with the reader's expectations and perspectives brilliantly...Multi-layered, dotted with dry black humour and underpinned by a haunting sense of loneliness, this skilfully plotted psychological mystery leaves a few threads dangling, all of them leading back to an old woman living in London in 1933 with two greenfinches in a cage and a mysterious servant/companion called Sarah Whittle, of whom she is afraid. Equally filled with shifting perspectives, this parallel drama draws the book to its quietly nightmarish end.Gillespie and I, By Jane Harris | The Independent Retrieved 2019-01-27.", "*Peggy Hughes in Scotland on Sunday also praises the novel, \"It's tempting to marshal clich\u00e9s, for this book is a tour de force: taut, unsettling, funny, a story that holds you in its grip and makes you skip ahead but circle back again for more of the same - literary crack cocaine - but Gillespie And I transcends clich\u00e9. It has all the tension and documentary detail of Kate Summerscale's The Suspicions Of Mr Whicher; the scathing irony of Jane Austen and in Harriet Baxter a memorable heroine: part Marple, part Barbara from Notes On A Scandal, part something entirely unique, whose personality and story will continue to inhabit the mind of the reader long after all is said and done.\"Book review: Gillespie and I by Jane Harris - Scotsman.com Living Retrieved 2019-01-27.", "*Anthony Cummins in The Daily Telegraph is less enamoured though: \"in order to succeed, Gillespie and I must eke suspense from the nagging accumulation of discrepancies that slowly oblige you to view the narrator not as a good Samaritan but as a needy busybody. But \u2013 for this reader at least \u2013 these discrepancies provoke incredulity rather than curiosity. The phrase \u201cas it happened\u201d (or its variants, \u201cas it transpired\u201d and \u201cit so happened\u201d) is made to gloss over one coincidence too many. I rarely believed Ned would let Harriet into his life\"...\"The ending, as with any mystery, solves a few of these difficulties. All the same, one hesitates to recommend a 500-page book that can be appreciated only in retrospect.\"Gillespie and I by Jane Harris: review - Telegraph Retrieved 2019-01-27.", "Gillespie and I was adapted into a ten-part radio play in BBC Radio 4's 15 Minute Drama series.BBC Radio 4 - 15 Minute Drama, Jane Harris - Gillespie and I, Episode 1 Retrieved 2019-01-27.", "*Jane Harris talks to Jane Garvey on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour about her second novel: Gillespie and I", "*Gillespie and I / Jane Harris interview / Before I Go To Sleep | Scottish Book Trust", "*Savidge Reads Grills\u2026 Jane Harris | Savidge Reads", "*Gillespie and I by Jane Harris | Gutter", "*The Woman Behind the Curtain: Gillespie and I by Jane Harris | HuffPost"]}, {"page": "Sugar Money (novel)", "response": ["Sugar Money, the third novel by British author Jane Harris, was first published by Faber and Faber in 2017 and shortlisted for several literary prizes including the Walter Scott Prize.
