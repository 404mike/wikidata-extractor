Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham, K.P. (9 August 1799 \u2013 20 August 1868), was an Irish peer and Member of Parliament.\nLord Farnham was the son of The 6th Baron Farnham and Lady Anne Butler. He was elected to the House of Commons for County Cavan in 1824, a seat he continued to represent until 1838. The latter year he succeeded his father to become The 7th Baron Farnham, inheriting the huge Farnham Estate in County Cavan, and subsequently served as an Irish Representative Peer from 1839 to 1868. He was made a Knight of St. Patrick in 1845.\nLord Farnham married Anna Stapleton, daughter of Thomas Stapleton, 16th Baron le Despencer, on 3 December 1828. The couple had no children. Lord and Lady Farnham were killed in the Abergele train disaster in August 1868. After his death, a statue in his honour was erected in Cavan, allegedly 'by his tenants'. The statue now sits in front of the relatively new Johnston Central Library on Farnham Street in the town.\nThe Farnham family crest reads Je suis pret (I am ready).\nHe was succeeded by his younger brother Somerset Richard Maxwell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baron Farnham", "response": ["*Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham (1799\u20131868)"]}, {"page": "List of Irish representative peers", "response": ["|Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham||2 July 1839||Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon||20 August 1868", "|Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse||22 December 1868||Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham||29 August 1908"]}, {"page": "1868 in Ireland", "response": ["*20 August \u2013 Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham, politician and peer (born 1799)."]}, {"page": "1799 in Ireland", "response": ["*9 August \u2013 Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham, politician and peer (died 1868)."]}, {"page": "Henry Maxwell, 6th Baron Farnham", "response": ["# Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham (b. 9 August 1799 - d. 20 August 1868)."]}, {"page": "Maxwell (surname)", "response": ["*Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham (1799\u20131868), Irish politician"]}, {"page": "Henry Maxwell", "response": ["* Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham (1799\u20131868), Irish peer and Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Baron Farnham (1799-1868)", "response": ["#redirectHenry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| 24 February 1824 ||County Cavan||John Maxwell-Barry||Tory||Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham||Tory||Barry succeeded to Irish peerage"]}, {"page": "Coolnashinny", "response": ["The Cavan Archives Service has a conveyance dated 4 October 1842 (reference number P017/0052) of the \"Coolnashinny\" in County Cavan \u2013 rented from Henry Maxwell, 7th Baron Farnham \u2013 from James Berry to his son John.
