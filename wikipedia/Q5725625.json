The latter year he succeeded his father to become The 7th Baron Farnham, inheriting the huge Farnham Estate in County Cavan, and subsequently served as an Irish Representative Peer from 1839 to 1868. He was made a Knight of St. Patrick in 1845.\nLord Farnham married Anna Stapleton, daughter of Thomas Stapleton, 16th Baron le Despencer, on 3 December 1828. The couple had no children.
