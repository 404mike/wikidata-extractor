They used 4 metres long fiberglass slalom-style kayaks specially designed by Pyranha Canoes with extra buyonancy and reinforcement. The expedition is notable for taking place in September to avoid ice and when the water was high to set new altitude record. They paddled at approximately 5300 mamsl on one of the lakes at the Khumbu Glacier. But the high water flow had its downside \u2014 many parts were too dangerous and had to be omitted; the result was that just two boats out of eleven survived to the end at the confluence with Sun Kosi. It is unclear which parts of the river were skipped, but the descent is generally considered incomplete. The next year, HTV documentary movie \"Dudh Kosi: Relentless River of Everest\" has been released which is a source of common misconception that this was the first trip on the river."]}, {"page": "Mike Jones, Canoeist", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Jones (canoeist)"]}, {"page": "Michael Jones", "response": ["Michael or Mike Jones may refer to:", "*Mike Jones (jazz musician) (born 1962), performs with Penn and Teller", "*Mike Jones (screenwriter) (born 1971), American screenwriter and journalist", "*Mike Jones (rapper) (born 1981), American rapper", "*Mike Jones (wide receiver, born 1960), American football player", "*Mike Jones (tight end) (born 1966), American football tight end", "*Mike Jones (defensive lineman) (born 1969), American football player", "*Mike Jones (linebacker) (born 1969), American football player most famous for the tackle that ended Super Bowl XXXIV", "*Mike Jones (offensive lineman) (born 1985), American football player", "*Mike Jones (wide receiver, born 1992), Canadian football wide receiver", "*Mike Jones (defensive back) (born 1995), Canadian football defensive back", "*Mike Jones (footballer) (born 1987), English footballer", "*Mike Jones (soccer) (born 1988), American soccer player", "*Mike Jones (referee) (born 1968), English football referee", "*Mike Jones (1890s pitcher) (1865\u20131894), Canadian baseball pitcher", "*Mike Jones (1980s pitcher) (born 1959), American baseball pitcher", "*Mike Jones (basketball, born 1965), American basketball head coach at Radford University", "*Mike Jones (basketball, born 1967), American basketball player, formerly for Auburn University", "*Mike Jones (basketball, born 1984), American basketball player, formerly for the University of Maryland", "*Mike Jones (wrestler) (born 1962), professional wrestler primarily known as \"Virgil\" in the WWF", "*Mike Jones (motocross rider) (born 1966), American freestyle motocross rider also known as \"Mad Mike Jones\"", "*Mike Jones (canoeist) (died 1978), English expedition canoeist", "*Mike Jones (boxer) (born 1983), American boxer of the 2000s and 2010s", "*Mike Jones (motorcyclist) (born 1994), Australian motorcycle racer", "*Mike Jones (athletic director) (born 1954), athletic director and men's basketball head coach", "*Mike Jones (personal trainer) (born 1957), alleged to have had an affair with evangelical preacher Ted Arthur Haggard", "*Mike Jones (politician), American politician from Pennsylvania", "*Mike Jones, pseudonym of Sywald Skeid (born 1971)", "*Mike Jones, security guard who shot Clay Duke during the 2010 Panama City school board shootings", "*Mike Jones, a character in the film Babel", "*Mike Jones, the protagonist of the 1990 Nintendo game StarTropics", "*Who Is Mike Jones?, a 2005 album by the rapper Mike Jones"]}, {"page": "Utley, West Yorkshire", "response": ["* Mike Jones (canoeist), died whilst trying to rescue a companion on the Braldu River for which he was posthumously awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal (QGM)"]}, {"page": "Dave Manby", "response": ["In 1976, at the age of 21, Dave was asked to join five other kayakers in a team of ten on the famous first descent of the Dudh Kosi, the river running off Mount Everest the trip leader was Mike Jones.
