From 1936 onwards he had been a frequent contributor to the Architectural Review and from 1943 to 1945 he stood in as its acting editor while the regular editor J. M. Richards was on active service. Under the ARs influence, Pevsner's approach to modern architecture became more complex and more moderate. Early signs of a lifelong interest in Victorian architecture, also influenced by the Architectural Review, appeared in a series written under the pseudonym of \"Peter F. R. Donner\": Pevsner's \"Treasure Hunts\"  guided readers down selected London streets, pointing out architectural treasures of the 19th century. He was also closely involved with the Reviews proprietor, H. de C. Hastings, in evolving the magazine's theories on picturesque planning."]}, {"page": "Hubert de Cronin Hastings", "response": ["#REDIRECT H. de C. Hastings"]}]}}
