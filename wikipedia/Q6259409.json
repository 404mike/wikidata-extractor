General Claude Auchinleck distributed a directive to his commanders seeking to dispel the notion that Rommel was a \"superman\". The Battle of Kasserine Pass during the Tunisian Campaign intensified the GIs' admiration towards Rommel. The cult of personality was so strong that, according to Peter Schrijvers, \"for the remainder of the war, German POWs would part with pictures of Rommel as reluctantly as GIs were eager to get them\". While Allied troops respected Rommel, civilians held the \"widely accepted\" negative image of Rommel's origin and his connection with the Nazis. As described by Rosie Goldschmidt Waldeck (who debunked the invented story) and The New York Times in 1943, \"It has been said that Rommel started his career as a Hitler hoodlum and owes his quick rise to his early collaboration with Himmler.\" This line of propaganda perpetuated until the war ended. According to Atkinson, to counter the \"perverse chivalry\" (\"war without hate\", in Rommel's words) that Rommel promoted, the British and American authorities instituted hate training and tried to raise the eagerness to kill the enemies by stressing enemy brutality, as well as spattering slaughterhouse blood in assault training courses. General John Strawson notes the same difference in attitudes to war between the leaderships of the two sides."]}, {"page": "The Horse (poem)", "response": ["John Strawson, the British soldier and author wrote in his memoires entitled Hussars, Horses and History, \"Those fortunate to have owned, ridden and loved horses will be in no doubt when we emphatically endorse the answer to Ronald Duncan's question.\""]}]}}
