Connell Rawlinson left Vale for National League side Notts County on a free transfer on 5 August, having been transfer-listed by Askey in pre-season. The first game at Vale Park of the Shanahan era came against Northampton Town, and Amoo opened his account for the club with a header before \"Cobblers\" midfielder Ryan Watson levelled the score at 1\u20131 just before half-time; Askey said the players performed well but needed to show more belief. On 17 August, Vale travelled to Moor Lane for their first ever game against Salford City and came close to recording their first win of the season after Bennett put them ahead with nine minutes to go, only for Jake Beesley to level the game at 1\u20131 in the third minute of stoppage-time. Four days later Vale recorded their first ever victory over Forest Green Rovers; James Gibbons went from hero to villain within the opening six minutes as he crossed for Bennett to score only to give away the ball soon after the restart to gift Joseph Mills the equalising goal, and then Cristian Monta\u00f1o crossed the ball to Amoo for the game's winning goal on 34 minutes. However they ended the week with a their first league loss of the season, a heavy 5\u20132 defeat at Grimsby Town that Askey described as a \"reality check\". Askey boosted his squad with a triple signing, bringing in 29-year-old former Notts County defender Shaun Brisley, 25-year-old former Bury striker Jordan McFarlane-Archer, and 20-year-old midfielder Jake Taylor on loan from Nottingham Forest. Vale ended the month with a dour 1\u20130 victory over Cambridge United, Amoo's 84th-minute cross having been bungled over the goalline by a United defender."]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Salford City F.C. season", "response": ["| 3 January 2020 || CF ||  || Jake Beesley ||  Solihull Moors || Undisclosed || ", "| 7 October 2019 || CF ||  || Jake Beesley ||  Solihull Moors || 3 January 2020 || "]}]}}
