The squad was joined by five players who were signed during the off season, former Bristol City and Scotland international full-back Jamie McAllister, released Oldham Athletic duo Keanu Marsh-Brown and Reuben Reid, former Doncaster Rovers forward James Hayter and attacking midfielder Sam Foley after he rejected a new contract with Conference side Newport County. Midfielder Michael Woods was invited back for pre-season training after a non-contract spell at the end of last season, but did not return and Oxford City full-back James Clarke was also invited for a pre-season trial. The first day of pre-season saw the signing of versatile left sided player Nathan Ralph following his release from Peterborough United and former Northampton Town winger Lewis Young. These two new players were supplemented by trialists including Clarke, Canadian goalkeeper Lucas Birnstingl, former Kilmarnock midfielder Ross Lindsay and former Southampton trainee Aarran Racine. On 4 July 2012, despite being half way through his two-year contract defender Bondz N'Gala left the club for fellow League One side Stevenage. Central defender Byron Webster, who had been released by Northampton Town earlier in the day, was signed on a two-year contract and the following day the club sign former loan goalkeeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch on a two-year contract.

The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw with Ed Upson scoring for Yeovil. The subsequent friendly away against Southern League side Poole Town saw a cull of trialists with only Ciss\u00e9 and Racine remaining in the side, although Clarke's absence was due to injury, they were joined by former Chesterfield defender Aaron Downes. The game ended in a 2\u20130 for Yeovil thanks to a brace from Marsh\u2013Brown. On 19 July, young forward Gozie Ugwu arrived on a six-month loan from Reading making him Yeovil's eleventh signing of the summer. The same day the club confirmed that Racine and Ciss\u00e9's trials had been terminated, the club also revealed that previous shirt sponsors Jones Building Contractors had chosen not to take up the option to extend their deal and so the club were in negotiations with businesses to become the club's main sponsor for the 2012\u201313 season. Midfielder Dominic Blizzard missed the first six pre-season friendlies having suffered a broken hand in training. On 21 July, Yeovil faced League Two side Plymouth Argyle at the home of Dorchester Town The Avenue Stadium due to problems with the Huish Park pitch, Yeovil strolled to a 5\u20130 win with a hat-trick from Reuben Reid and goals from Hayter and Marsh-Brown.

The following day Yeovil played their first home friendly against Bristol Rovers and despite taking the lead through Rohan Ince the game ended in a 1\u20131 draw.", "Yeovil's dismal run of form continued into October, and despite a Reuben Reid penalty the club suffered a 2\u20131 home defeat against Portsmouth, their sixth consecutive defeat as the club slid to 16th in the League One table. The game proved more costly for Yeovil than merely a defeat with injuries to both Lewis Young, ankle ligament damage and Gozie Ugwu, recurrence of a hamstring injury, ruling them both out for the month of October, in an attempt to arrest this run of form and as cover for those injuries, on 4 October, Gary Johnson completed the loan signing of Republic of Ireland U21 striker Paddy Madden from Carlisle United. The move worked with immediate effect with Madden scoring a brace on his debut and Hayter adding a third in a 3\u20131 victory over Colchester United. The poor run of form though was reflected by the Colchester United match being the club's lowest ever Football League attendance of just 3,002. This improved performance led to a double nomination in the Football League's Team of the Week with Irish duo Madden and winger Sam Foley both represented. On 9 October, Yeovil's away Football League Trophy tie against Torquay United was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Plainmoor, with the match rescheduled for the following week on the following Saturday the winner of the tie was given the reward of a home Area Quarter-final tie against Wycombe Wanderers in the next round. Another encouraging performance away at league leaders Tranmere Rovers saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead after half an hour thanks to goals from Madden and Foley, but another second half collapse saw Tranmere comeback to win the game 3\u20132 with Yeovil's plight not aided by having Joe Edwards sent off for two yellow cards. In their rearranged tie on 16 October, Yeovil salvaged a 2\u20132 draw against Torquay United with a stoppage time equaliser from James Hayter, to add to his earlier goal, with Yeovil winning the tie 5\u20134 on penalties, having scored all five of their spot kicks and keeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch having saved Torquay's Thomas Cruise's effort. The victory confirming Yeovil's progress to the Area Quarter-final stage of the Football League Trophy, for the first time in five years, with a home tie against Wycombe Wanderers. An unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over a ten-man Bury followed courtesy of goals from Byron Webster and Foley, the performance of midfielder Korey Smith earned him recognition in the League One Team of the Week. That weekend in the draw for the FA Cup First Round Proper Yeovil were given an away tie against fellow League One side Preston North End, to be played on 3 November. On 23 October, with injuries continuing to hamper the squad young Jamaican-born midfielder Daniel Johnson joined the club on a month-long youth loan deal from Aston Villa. That evening Yeovil strolled to a 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden and a goal from top scorer Hayter who took his tally for the season to seven, Daniel Johnson made his debut as a second-half substitute but had the ignominy of giving away a penalty. Yeovil ended the month with a third consecutive victory this time a 1\u20130 away win against Crewe Alexandra thanks to a second goal in a week for defender Byron Webster, the result was also only Yeovil's second clean sheet in the League that season. After a two-month loan spell at AFC Wimbledon, defender Curtis Haynes-Brown returned to the club having made six appearances for the Dons. Webster's winning goal and the club's second league clean sheet of the season led to his inclusion in the Football League's Team of the Week.", "Prior to the club's first season in the Football League Championship, Yeovil released Dominic Blizzard, Richard Hinds and Gavin Williams. Manager Gary Johnson and his backroom staff of Terry Skiverton and Darren Way signed new two-year deals to confirm they would lead Yeovil in the Championship.

The following day the club played an unofficial friendly match against Portuguese Segunda Liga side SC Farense, taking place at the Browns Leisure Complex in Quarteira where the Glovers had been training. Yeovil lost the friendly 2\u20130 and had to play part of the second half with 10-men following the sending off of Chelsea loanee Billy Clifford for a second bookable offence. Yeovil returned home to play Torquay United in a friendly, on 16 July, where their squad included former Southampton defender Danny Seaborne. Despite dominating the game in terms of possession and chances two late Torquay goals condemned the Glovers to a second consecutive 2\u20130 defeat. A third consecutive defeat without scoring followed with a 5\u20130 defeat against Premier League side Swansea City in the club's first home friendly. After the game the club confirmed the signing of former Southampton defender Seaborne on a two-year contract. On 23 July, Yeovil confirmed the signing of Swansea City defender Alan Tate on loan until 2 January 2014, the club made the announcement of the signing by producing a mocked-up picture of an easel outside Huish Park following the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son the day before. Tate made his debut that evening in a 2\u20131 friendly victory over Exeter City courtesy of goals from Ed Upson and Paddy Madden. The players who didn't feature prominently in the club's final home friendly played a Bristol City U21 side, on 25 July. The Yeovil XI won the match 3\u20131 thanks to a brace from Sam Hoskins and a goal from Liverpool loanee Michael Ngoo. Yeovil then travelled to Home Park to play Plymouth Argyle on 27 July, Yeovil's side featured a new trialist in the shape of former Port Vale midfielder Ryan Burge. The Glovers won the match 2\u20131 with first half goals from Madden and Hayter. Yeovil's final game of pre-season was a trip to The New Lawn to play Forest Green Rovers.

With Birmingham leading 2\u20131 going into injury time at the end of normal time, Byron Webster made it 2\u20132 to send the tie into extra-time when he controversially chipped into an empty net after Birmingham goalkeeper Colin Doyle had kicked the ball out following an injury to Dan Burn. Yeovil initially refused to allow Birmingham to walk-in an equaliser, with the game in extra time defender Luke Ayling scored his first goal for Yeovil after 145 appearances to make it 3\u20132 to Yeovil in extra time with a left-footed drive. Then at the start of the second period of extra-time Lee Novak was allowed to score an unopposed equaliser after manager Gary Johnson decided Webster's goal had been \"ungentlemanly\". Yeovil eventually lost the game 3\u20132 on penalties. Prior to Yeovil's match with Reading it was confirmed that Irish striker Paddy Madden had suffered a knee injury and would be out for four weeks, and midfielder Lewis Young would be released from his short-term contract. Yeovil's first League meeting with Reading resulted in a fourth consecutive league defeat after a controversial penalty from Reading striker Adam Le Fondre handed Yeovil a 1\u20130 defeat to leave the Glovers in the relegation zone of the Championship."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Lewis Young", "|14 July 2014||MF||Lewis Young||Bury||Free||"]}, {"page": "Charles Banya", "response": ["On 7 August 2014, Banya joined Crawley Town on a short-term deal after his release from Fulham.
