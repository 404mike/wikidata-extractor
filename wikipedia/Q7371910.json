Most European and foreign countries that aired the show broadcast it in daytime. Ratings for the show would be very high for the first three years, but following the departure of Rowena Wallace in early 1985 to pursue other acting opportunities, ratings quickly began to decline, and a clever idea was put in play for Wallace's character Patricia Hamilton to return to the soap played by another actress. In mid-1985, new actress to the show Belinda Giblin arrived as Alison Carr, the new identity of Patricia, who had plastic surgery in Rio de Janeiro to escape from authorities who were looking for her in Australia for supposedly murdering a wealthy millionaire's son named Luke Carlyle, who had embezzled his father's and Patricia's firm. Patricia used this new identity to regain entry into Australia and with an instant boost to viewership figures watching the storyline the show was deemed to be saved from cancellation. However, when Wallace returned to the show in its final season, as Patricia's/Alison's twin, Pamela, ratings began to slide and after six successful years the show ended in 1987 and would be replaced with new half-hour soap Home and Away, created by Alan Bateman, and featuring former Sons and Daughters screenwriter Bevan Lee. Sons and Daughters is best remembered for its over-the-top storylines and dramatic, and often hilarious, cliffhangers. One such cliffhanger featured character Alison Carr (Belinda Giblin) being bitten by a venomous snake, which had been hidden in a wall safe that Alison broke into to steal documents from villain Wayne Hamilton, played by Ian Rawlings. Though the snake used, a python, would have a non-lethal bite, that storyline featuring the infamous snake cliffhanger was often credited as a way to try and increase ratings for the show. Another rather spurious storyline featured a bomb being hidden in the bottom of wheelchair that killed off Barney Adams, a love interest of Fiona Thompson, when it exploded. The show gained a cult following and has been repeated more than once in both Australian and international territories.", "Sons and Daughters won the 1983 Logie Award for Most Popular Australian Drama. Rowena Wallace was the most nominated actress of the soap and was nominated for a Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television at the 26th Annual TV Week Logie Awards in 1984, and went on to win the award the following year in 1985. She was the first woman to win the award since it was opened up to Most Popular Australian Personality.", "The initial premise for the show was a Romeo and Juliet-style romance storyline which revolved around two families, the wealthy Hamilton family who lived in Sydney, and the Palmers, a working-class family from Melbourne. The characters of John Palmer (Peter Phelps) and spoilt rich girl Angela Hamilton (Ally Fowler) meet by chance whilst John is on the run from the police for a murder he did not commit. The two fall in love, not realising that they are actually twins, separated at birth 20 years earlier following an affair between their parents, David Palmer (Tom Richards) and Patricia (Rowena Wallace). Early episodes saw the pair discover the truth about their heritage and showed the problems and strains this put on their own relationship and those of their immediate families. While on the run John is protected in Sydney by Fiona Thompson (Pat McDonald), a former madame and prostitute and now boarding house owner who had raised John when he was a young boy. With a new identity and now going by the name of Scott Edwards, John attempts to build a new life, with the help of Fiona and her friend Jill Taylor (Kim Lewis), another former prostitute.", "Season 4 features a major turning point with the departure of its most popular cast member, Patricia. When Rowena Wallace chose to leave, the producers attempted to replace Patricia with several strong female antagonists in the form of Karen Fox, Leigh Palmer (Lisa Crittenden) and Caroline Morrell (Abigail) but none of these proved as successful, leading the producers to bring the character of Patricia back, albeit played by former The Box star Belinda Giblin, having undergone plastic surgery in Rio de Janeiro and now calling herself Alison Carr.", "Departing characters included original member David Palmer and recent additions Ginny Doyle, Tick McCarthy and Glen Young. New additions include Nick Benson, Greg Hudson and Sarah Hudson, and in an attempt to boost flagging ratings, producers lured back Rowena Wallace, who had previously played Patricia, to play her own twin sister Pamela\u2014a storyline which, ultimately failed to save the series.", "| Rowena Wallace || \"Pat the Rat\" Patricia Hamilton/Morrell/Palmer || First appeared episode 2 ~ 1982\u20131985, 1987", "# \"Bosom Buddies\" (Pat McDonald and Rowena Wallace)", "# \"Friends\" (Rowena Wallace)"]}, {"page": "Beauty and the Beast (talk show)", "response": ["| Rowena Wallace"]}, {"page": "Logie Awards of 1989", "response": ["*\"The Golden Girls\" (Lorrae Desmond, Hazel Phillips, Pat McDonald, Jeanne Little, Denise Drysdale, Rowena Wallace)"]}, {"page": "Kedron State High School", "response": ["* Rowena Wallace \u2013 actress"]}, {"page": "Logie Awards of 1985", "response": ["::Rowena Wallace in Sons and Daughters (Seven Network)", ":Winner: Rowena Wallace in Sons and Daughters (Seven Network)"]}, {"page": "Cop Shop", "response": ["*Rowena Wallace as Pamela Taylor"]}, {"page": "Logie Awards of 1983", "response": [":Winner: Rowena Wallace in Sons and Daughters (Seven Network)"]}, {"page": "Logie Awards of 1984", "response": ["::Rowena Wallace in Sons and Daughters (Seven Network)", "::Rowena Wallace in Sons and Daughters (Seven Network)"]}, {"page": "Twelfth Night Theatre", "response": ["The Twelfth Night Theatre continues as a contemporary theatre and has attracted over a number of years various British comedies starring such well-known actors as John Inman from the long-running television series, Are You Being Served, Gorden Kaye and Sue Hodge from Allo Allo.
