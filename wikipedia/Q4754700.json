Having made only three appearances, Brodie's contract with Boston was terminated on 15 February 2017, because of what manager Adam Murray described as an \"internal matter\".

He made his debut a week later, starting in Southport's 1\u20130 home win over Boreham Wood, in which he was substituted for Andrai Jones on 61 minutes.
