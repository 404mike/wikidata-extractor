The book is an analysis of the Hollywood blockbuster phenomenon driven chiefly by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in the 1970s, based on interviews with these and other filmmakers. Shone's first novel, In the Rooms was published in the U.K. by Hutchinson on July 2, 2009 and in the U.S. by St Martin's Press in 2011. He also wrote the books Martin Scorsese: A Retrospective and Woody Allen: A retrospective, published in 2014 and 2015.Shone collaborated with Christopher Nolan for an in-depth look at the filmmaker's work, called The Nolan Variations: The Movies, Mysteries, and Marvels of Christopher Nolan (2020). Library Journal wrote in their review that \"this is the definitive word on Nolan and a must for film buffs.\" Neal Gabler called the book \"intelligent, illuminating, rigorous, and highly readable.

It was only because Alan Ladd, Jr., at 20th Century Fox liked American Graffiti that he forced through a production and distribution deal for the film, which ended up restoring Fox to financial stability after a number of flops.Tom Shone: Blockbuster: How Hollywood Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Summer (2004).

Film historian Tom Shone commented on the film's innovation and influence, saying that, \"In its way, Jurassic Park heralded a revolution in movies as profound as the coming of sound in 1927.\" Many filmmakers saw Jurassic Parks effects as a realization that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible. ILM owner George Lucas, realizing the success of creating realistic live dinosaurs by his own company, started to make the Star Wars prequels; Stanley Kubrick decided to invest in pet project A.I. Artificial Intelligence, to which he would later bring Spielberg to direct; and Peter Jackson began to re-explore his childhood love of fantasy films, a path that led him to The Lord of the Rings and King Kong. Jurassic Park has also inspired films and documentaries with dinosaurs such as the American adaptation of Godzilla, Dinosaur from the Deep, Carnosaur (in which Laura Dern's mother Diane Ladd starred), Dinosaur Island and Walking with Dinosaurs.

Two years later, Star Wars expanded on the success of Jaws, setting box office records and enjoying a theatrical run that lasted more than a year. After the success of Jaws and Star Wars, many Hollywood producers attempted to create similar \"event\" films with wide commercial appeal, and film companies began green-lighting increasingly large-budget films, and relying extensively on massive advertising blitzes leading up to their theatrical release. These two films were the prototypes for the \"summer blockbuster\" trend, in which major film studios and distributors planned their annual marketing strategy around a big release by July 4.Shone (2004), Chapter 1."]}, {"page": "Anne Tyler", "response": ["Just as Tyler is difficult to categorize as a novelist, it is also challenging to label her style. Novelist Cathleen Schine describes how her \"style without a style\" manages to pull the reader into the story: \"So rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural -- even inevitable.\"  The San Francisco Chronicle made a similar point: \"One does not so much read a Tyler novel as visit it. Her ability to conduct several conversations at once while getting the food to the table turns the act of reading into a kind of transport.\"  Reviewer Tom Shone put it this way: \"You're involved before you ever notice you were paying attention.\" Joyce Carol Oates, in her review of The Amateur Marriage, perhaps described the phenomenon best: \"When the realistic novel works its magic, you won't simply have read about the experiences of fictitious characters, you will have seemed to have lived them; your knowledge of their lives transcends their own, for they can only live in chronological time.

In the next month, she guest starred as Amanda Barrington in the animated sitcom Family Guy, in the episode \"No Country Club for Old Men\". Roberts then starred in the comedy film We're the Millers, alongside Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. It was released on August 3, 2013. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a financial success, grossing over $269 million against a budget of $37 million. Roberts played the lead role in Gia Coppola's directorial debut, Palo Alto, based on James Franco's short story collection of the same name. The film was released on August 29, 2013. It received generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Roberts' performance.

Many reviewers directed their criticism at Diana Ross, who they believed was too old to play Dorothy. Most agreed that what had worked so successfully on stage simply did not translate well to the screen. Hischak's Through the Screen Door: What Happened to the Broadway Musical When It Went to Hollywood criticized \"Joel Schumacher's cockamamy screenplay\", and called \"Believe in Yourself\" the score's weakest song. He described Diana Ross's portrayal of Dorothy as: \"cold, neurotic and oddly unattractive\"; and noted that the film was \"a critical and box office bust\". In his work History of the American Cinema, Harpole characterized the film as \"one of the decade's biggest failures\", and, \"the year's biggest musical flop\". The Grove Book of Hollywood noted that \"the picture finished off Diana Ross's screen career\", as the film was Ross's final theatrical feature. In his 2004 book Blockbuster, Tom Shone referred to The Wiz as \"expensive crud\". In the book Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood, the author criticized the script, noting, \"The Wiz was too scary for children, and too silly for adults.\" Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 The Wizard of Oz film, did not think highly of The Wiz, stating \"The Wiz is overblown and will never have the universal appeal that the classic MGM musical has obtained.\""]}, {"page": "Jessica Chastain", "response": ["The journalist Tom Shone describes Chastain as being \"excessively luscious [with] pale Botticelli features wrapped around a bone structure that has a touch of the masculine, right down to the cleft in her chin.\" She was named the sexiest vegetarian actress in a poll conducted by PETA in 2012.

He writes, \"the future does not provide the promise of desire's realization but rather a repeated failure to attain its object. By scrambling chronology, atemporal films make evident this failure for the spectator and thus encourage the spectator to embrace the repetition of the drive rather than put their faith in a different future.\" In 2020, Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Nolan's concept of \"balancing scales\" has become less focused on the individual and \"more innately aware of the communal and global.\" He noted that the filmmaker is concerned with the notions of legacy and justice, as well as \"the preservation of the future, ensuring that there is one for the next generations, even if that means sacrifice in the here and now.\""]}]}}
