He was the first editor of the Toronto Leader and published a biography on his father-in-law William Lyon Mackenzie, The Life and Times of Wm. Lyon Mackenzie (1962).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Lyon Mackenzie", "response": ["In 1861 his health deteriorated and he refused to take medication. At the end of August, he went into a coma and died on August28. His funeral procession stretched a half-mile (0.8 km) and included Reformers and Family Compact members. He was buried at Toronto Necropolis. A twelve-foot Celtic cross made of grey granite serves as a grave marker. He is buried with his wife, four of his children, his son-in-law Charles Lindsey, and his descendants.", "Mackenzie wrote about current events and topics he was thinking about at a particular moment. His writing format often lacked structure and used obscure references difficult for today's readers to understand. Historian Lillian F. Gates struggled to comprehend The Life and Times of Martin Van Buren because Mackenzie did not describe events chronologically and in her opinion used too many footnotes and large lists. Frederick Armstrong, another historian, said Mackenzie used long examples and had \"excursions into trivia\". William Kilbourn critiqued Sketches of Canada and the United States as unconcerned with conventional storytelling techniques or \"a sense of order\", and Charles Lindsey described the book as disregarding the order of the stories."]}, {"page": "Canada First", "response": ["Although the party counted among its early supporters former Ontario Premier and prominent Liberal Edward Blake, Blake's decision to accept a position in Alexander Mackenzie's government in 1875 led to the party's quick collapse. By 1876 their weekly newspaper organ The Nation, edited by Charles Lindsey, had closed."]}, {"page": "Nahnebahwequa", "response": ["Catherine and William were devastated. By 1861 the Indian Department began negotiating the Manatoulin Treaty for white settlers.  Manitoulin Island had been promised in 1836 to remain forever in the hands of the Native people.  Catherine again stood up for Native Rights and opposed very strongly this purchase. Charles Lindsey, who was the editor of the Toronto Leader, wrote an unfavorable racist article in his newspaper. Catherine responded with her own very powerful letter that criticized Lindsey and the government for their attempt to purchase Manitoulin Island for white settlers.  She had seen this happen again and again with the Mississauga, Saugeen and Nawash."]}, {"page": "John Rolph (politician)", "response": ["As a politician, Rolph's contemporaries had conflicting views on his actions. James Lesslie and Jesse Ketchum wanted to commission a portrait of Rolph in 1837 as a reward for his service, while Jonas Jones said he possessed a \"vile and democratic heart\". He could contemplate multiple perspectives on an issue and easily persuaded others to agree with his perspective. In his book on the Upper Canada Rebellion, John Charles Dent praised Rolph's actions and criticised William Lyon Mackenzie's leadership. Mackenzie's sons-in-law Charles Lindsey and John King published critiques of Dent's book that disputed Rolph's influence in the rebellion. Historians have struggled to write about Rolph because he rarely described his personal feelings to others and wrote few documents expressing his political opinions."]}, {"page": "Toronto Necropolis", "response": ["* Charles Lindsey\u00a0\u2013 editor-in-chief of the Toronto Daily Leader and son-in-law of William Lyon Mackenzie (1908)"]}, {"page": "Charles Lindsey", "response": ["Charles Lindsey may refer to:", "*Charles Lindsey (editor) (1820\u20131909), English-born Canadian journalist and editor"]}]}}
