Aitchison, KCSI, late Lieut-Governor of the Punjab, he produced The Late Dr Rev. Norman McLeod, LLD, etc, the Queen's chaplain and another one of several works commissioned by Queen Victoria and now in Windsor Castle. In 1887 he completed a bust of Her Majesty the Queen and of her consort Prince Albert, presented to the Victoria Art Galleries, Dundee by ex-Provost Ballingall, in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year. In 1889 he was commissioned by the Queen to create a memorial to the Royal Stewarts in Paisley Abbey: \"a recumbent sculptured cross of Peterhead granite, on which will rest a Gothic cross of Sicilian marble.\" It was to be installed in September 1889.Aberdeen Free Press, Monday 25 February 1889 p5 col3: The Queen and the Royal StewartsDundee Advertiser, Tuesday 16 July 1889 p6 col4: The Queen's gift to Paisley AbbeyGraphic, Saturday 1 February 1890 p15 col1: The Royal Stewart memorial in Paisley Abbey The same year, he exhibited A Torch Racer which had been the model for the 1887 Figure of Youth.A Torch Racer, sculptor John Hutchison", "By 1890 he was 68 years old, and producing as much as ever. That year, he exhibited The late Dr Andrew Combe, The late Hon. Lord Fraser, The late John Grigor, MD, Nairn, and the head of Dante in marble. At the RSA Exhibition in 1890 his Grigor was the most conspicuous piece: \"an entirely realistic figure in bronze, with pilot-jacket overcoat, with wide-awake hat, as in life.\"Illustrated London News, Saturday 1 March 1890 p22 col3: Royal Scottish Academy Exhibition of Fine Arts 1891 brought Bust of a Lady, William Tod, Esq., and The Late William Wright, LLD, Professor of Arabic, Cambridge University. In 1892 he produced Henry Irving in the role of Hamlet, Baillie Harris and Miss Harris in the High School of Dundee, Sir Douglas Maclagan, MD, etc., and Study of a Girl's Head. 1893 brought more memorials, besides portraits to be presented with testaments. These were The Late J. F. MacLennan, LLD, Advocate, La Penserosa in reference to a poem by Louise Colet, The Late Mrs Barbour of Bonskied, The Late Alexander Kilgour, MD, Aberdeen, and Bust of a lady. The private commissions continued throughout 1894, with James Carmichael, Engineer, Dundee, Miss Ethel Campbell Smith, Bust of a Lady and The Regent Murray. His life must have become more interesting in 1895, because some projects had scope for invention: Agriculture, Engineering, and Study for a Head of a Colossal Statue. Perhaps now he could afford not to accept so many private commissions by 1896. In that year he made or exhibited The late Charles Jenner, Esq., and Pasquccia, Roman study, and Study of a Girl's Head. In 1897 he showed William McEwan, Esq., MP, George Buchanan, humanist and reformer, and The late Charles U. Aitchison, KCSI, Lieut-Governor of the Punjab, for the Aitchison College, Lahore. In 1898 he created Dante, Ravenna. His portrait of Professor George James Allman is undated, but Allman died in 1898."]}]}}
