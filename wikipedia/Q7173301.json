From October 1968 until his death in August 1991, Clayton presented jazz recordings, interviews, studio performances, and live performances on BBC Radio 1, 2, and 3, as well as the BBC World Service.  He co-authored several books about music and jazz with Peter Gammond and was a frequent contributor to jazz magazines.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shirley Bassey", "response": ["The \"Goldfinger\" theme song, however, had a lasting impact on her career. In the sleeve notes for Bassey's 25th Anniversary Album (1978), Peter Clayton noted that: \"Acceptance in America was considerably helped by the enormous popularity of (\"Goldfinger\")...But she had actually established herself there as early as 1961, in cabaret in New York. She was also a success in Las Vegas...'I suppose I should feel hurt that I've never been really big in America on record since \"Goldfinger\"...But, concertwise, I always sell out.'...\" This was reflected in the fact that Bassey had only one solo LP reach the top 20 in a US chart (R&B, Live at Carnegie Hall), and she was technically a one-hit wonder. In the aftermath of \"Goldfinger\" her UK sales started to falter as well: only two of her singles would enter the UK top 40 from 1966 to 1970. She had signed to United Artists, and her first album on that label, I've Got a Song for You (1966), spent one week on the chart; from 1966 to 1970, only two albums would chart, one of those a compilation. One of her best-known singles, \"Big Spender\" was released in 1967, charting just short of the UK top 20."]}, {"page": "Patricia Highsmith", "response": ["* Patricia Highsmith interview (The Black House) with Peter Clayton, Meridian, BBC World Service, August 8, 1980."]}, {"page": "Sgt.

Schaffner said that the consensus was aptly summed up by Tom Phillips in The Village Voice, when he called the LP \"the most ambitious and most successful record album ever issued\". Among Britain's pop press, Peter Jones of Record Mirror said the album was \"clever and brilliant, from raucous to poignant and back again\", while Disc and Music Echo reviewer called it \"a beautiful and potent record, unique, clever, and stunning\". In The Times, William Mann described Sgt. Pepper as a \"pop music master-class\" and commented that, so considerable were its musical advances, \"the only track that would have been conceivable in pop songs five years ago\" was \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Having been among the first British critics to fully appreciate Revolver, Peter Clayton of Gramophone magazine said that the new album was \"like nearly everything the Beatles do, bizarre, wonderful, perverse, beautiful, exciting, provocative, exasperating, compassionate and mocking\". He found \"plenty of electronic gimmickry on the record\" before concluding: \"but that isn't the heart of the thing. It's the combination of imagination, cheek and skill that make this such a rewarding LP.\" Wilfrid Mellers, in his review for New Statesman, praised the album's elevation of pop music to the level of fine art, while Kenneth Tynan, The Times theatre critic, said it represented \"a decisive moment in the history of Western civilisation\"."]}, {"page": "Revolver (Beatles album)", "response": ["In Britain, the reception to Revolver was highly favourable.

The reviewer highlighted its \"electronic effects\", McCartney's \"penchant for the classics\" and Harrison's \"stunning use of the sitar\" as diverse elements that distinguished the LP as a group effort, such that the four band members' \"individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear\". The writer concluded: \"this is a brilliant album which underlines once and for all that the Beatles have definitely broken the bounds of what we used to call pop.\" Peter Clayton, a jazz critic for Gramophone magazine, described it as \"an astonishing collection\" that defied easy categorisation since much of the LP had no precedent in the context of pop music. Clayton concluded: \"if there's anything wrong with the record at all it is that such a diet of newness might give the ordinary pop-picker indigestion.\""]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 3", "response": ["Jazz Record Requests was the first weekly jazz programme on the Third Programme.
