He was a huge signing for the cash strapped and relegation hit club, as well as the addition of winger Andy Parkinson who had joined the club a few days previously. Reddy's first season was somewhat disappointing as the player was still recovering from a medial ligament injury and struggled to regain full fitness. Despite this Reddy was utilised as Town's favoured striker, mainly playing alongside Martin Gritton, Matt Harrold or Colin Cramb throughout this season. Notably though he did finish the season on a high scoring a hat trick against already doomed Kidderminster Harriers.

A week later on 13 August 2006, Hackett scored his first goal of the season, as well as setting up a goal for Danny Morgan, in a 2\u20132 draw against Wycombe Wanderers.

He signed for Grimsby Town in 2001 on youth scholarship deal. He was part of the youth setup managed by former Grimsby and Middlesbrough forward Paul Wilkinson that featured the likes of Cameron Jerome. Hegarty progressed at youth level until towards the end of the 2003\u20132004 season when he was added to the first team squad soon after the sacking of manager Paul Groves. However, he would have to wait until over a year later until he would make his first team debut, coming on as a late substitute for Andy Parkinson in a 4\u20131 away victory against Kidderminster Harriers on the final away game of the 2004\u201305 season. Hegarty continued to be a regular for the reserves in that season and scored a hat-trick in the home match against Lincoln City. Despite a good pre-season for Russell Slade's Town side, he spent most of the 2005\u201306 season as a fringe player, and was loaned out to Non-League clubs Whitby Town and Willenhall Town. Hegarty was to play a number of games in the 2006\u201307 season and became more involved in the first team under the tenure of Alan Buckley and his performances would eventually see him awarded a new two-year deal in the summer of 2007. Despite featuring more often in the first team Buckley placed Hegarty on the loan list and he went on to briefly join York City on a month's loan in September 2007, however he was to suffer a muscle strain which limited him to making two appearances during this spell. In the 2008\u20132009 season, Hegarty went on to feature heavily under Mike Newell and was Newell's preferred left winger, except for a two-month period when the club succeeded in loaning Stuart Elliott from Doncaster Rovers. His performances by the end of the 08\u201309 season had generally improved and his good form drew praise from several opposition managers which coincided with the Mariners' late surge to safety. In 09\u201310 season under Neil Woods Hegarty struggled to break into the first team, and suffered from several injuries. On 12 May 2010, Hegarty was one of seven players placed on the transfer list by Woods after their relegation from the Football League."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Andy Parkinson||||MF||2004\u20132006||88||12"]}, {"page": "2000 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|RM ||14|| Andy Parkinson || || "]}, {"page": "Clint Marcelle", "response": ["In a reward for his consistency in the previous season, Slade contacted Marcelle again and was invited for a pre-season trial with his new club Grimsby Town.

Grimsby was to be his first professional football club in two years. Despite being offered a contract, Marcelle found it extremely hard to break into the team and was often looked past in favour for Michael Reddy, Andy Parkinson and Darren Mansaram, and would often find it very difficult on winning a place on the substitute bench. Marcelle made his only start for the Mariners against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, and following only four other sub appearances, Marcelle would not play again for Grimsby.
