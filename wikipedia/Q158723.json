He made more than 100 appearances for Gillingham and became a target for a number of larger clubs, eventually signing for Wolverhampton Wanderers in June 2007. He became a first-team regular for the club, helping them win promotion to the top flight in 2009. In August 2012, he joined West Ham United for an undisclosed club record fee. In September 2015, he joined Norwich City on loan until the end of the season, and made that move permanent in January 2016. Jarvis spent three more years at the Canaries, including a brief loan spell with Walsall in 2019 before joining Woking and retiring in May 2021.\nHe received his first call-up to the England squad in 2011 and made his debut as a substitute against Ghana in a friendly at Wembley Stadium.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 22", "response": ["*  1986   \u2013 Matt Jarvis, English footballer"]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["West Ham, on their return to the Premier League, signed former players James Colllins and George McCartney on permanent deals, as well as record signing Matt Jarvis and Andy Carroll on loan.

The highlight of the first half of the season was a 3\u20131 home win against reigning European champions Chelsea on 1 December 2012 which saw them in eighth position and 12th at the end of the year. On 22 March 2013, West Ham secured a 99-year lease deal on the Olympic Stadium, with it planned to be used as their home ground from the 2016\u201317 season.

Houllier chose to rest a number of key first-team players, a move that was criticised by fans and the media alike. The club's league form also failed to improve. During a team-bonding exercise at a health spa in Leicestershire, Villa defenders James Collins and Richard Dunne were involved in a confrontation with club staff. The players were each fined two weeks' wages. However, Houllier said the incident did not affect team morale. On 19 March, Villa faced local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League at Villa Park. Prior to the match, a banner reading, \"Had enough, Houllier out\" was unveiled by some supporters in the stadium's Holte End stand. However, this was quickly removed by the club's stewarding staff. The away side won 1\u20130 thanks to a goal from Matt Jarvis, claiming their first win against Aston Villa in 31 years. Towards the end of the match, the home fans once again verbally attacked Houllier with chants of \"we want Houllier out\" and \"you don't know what you're doing\", before giving a chorus of boos at the final whistle."]}, {"page": "Professional Footballers' Association", "response": ["*Matt Jarvis (Norwich City, Championship)"]}, {"page": "Jonathan Woodgate", "response": ["Despite a decent enough start to his Stoke career, Woodgate went on to have poor performances against Sunderland, Newcastle and Bolton. He was dropped by Pulis and admitted that he needed to up his game. He failed to improve much, and in a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers Woodgate started the match at right back. He struggled against Matt Jarvis and gave away a penalty, then was substituted after twenty minutes by Pulis. He continued to play at right back though and admitted that his performances at Stoke had been 'up and down'.

I signed him on the back of that and he was different class for me. He's a great bloke, he'd fit in fabulously with the lads, if he's all right, if he's fully fit, but he looks it. He's trained with us and he looks the part at the moment, so hopefully he'll get through the game today. He was out playing in Denmark [with FC Copenhagen], he hurt his shoulder and he had to have an operation in the summer. That doesn't bother me too much. If it was his legs it might be bothering me, but it was his shoulder. He's a gentleman, he's a lovely fella, he'd fit in perfectly with the rest of the lads. I hope he proves that he's worth it.\""]}]}}
