The book has been described as \u2018mind-shifting\u2019 and '[addressing] the questions we ought to be facing\u2019. \nA renowned thinker and innovator on the reform of the welfare state, Cottam has designed and led large scale systemic innovation projects focusing on: employment, the prevention and management of chronic conditions, elder care, prison reform and family services. Working with communities across Britain and in Europe Cottam has worked to collaboratively design approaches that have changed thousands of lives. Transformation is achieved through a model that emphasises human relationships supported by technology.\nCottam argues that we need a social revolution: deep socio-economic change driven by technology combined with the demand to address climate change, requires us to think, work and organise in radical new ways. Her writing and practical collaborations around the theme of a fifth Social Revolution are at the core of her current work.\nCottam is credited as the pioneer of social design and was named UK Designer of the Year in 2005 for her ground-breaking methodology which fuses anthropology, psychoanalysis, business tools and a design process.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Bartlett", "response": ["The UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP) was established in October 2017 by founding Director Mariana Mazzucato (Professor in the Economics of Innovation and Public Value).
