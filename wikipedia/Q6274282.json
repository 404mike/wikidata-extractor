He briefly moved to Kidderminster Harriers before going on to join Kettering Town and Gainsborough Trinity. In 2006, he signed for Boston Town where his goal scoring rate earned him a move across town to Boston United. Rowan spent two seasons with United before returning to Boston Town in 2009. He retired from playing competitive football at the end of the 2009\u201310 season to concentrate on coaching within the sport.\nHe currently runs his own sports development firm called JR Sports which specialises in working with schools to improve sports access for children", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|2001|| Danny Coyne || Jonathan Rowan"]}, {"page": "Phil Jevons", "response": ["In July 2001, he was sold to Grimsby Town for \u00a3250,000. Grimsby were playing in the Football League First Division, and Jevons was one of the first signings of the new campaign for manager Lennie Lawrence. He became an instant hit at Blundell Park and helped fire Grimsby to the top of the league within the first five games of the season, notably his partnership with young striker Jonathan Rowan had shown early promise. On 9 October 2001, he scored a long-range goal in extra time of a League Cup fixture against Liverpool to send Grimsby through to the next round knocking Liverpool out. Jevons finished the 2001\u201302 season having played 37 games scoring eight goals in all competitions. After three substitute appearances for Grimsby in the 2002\u201303 season, Jevons was placed on the transfer list due to financial reasons, but was later removed and was sent out on a season-long loan to Humber derby rivals Hull City. He scored three goals in 26 games for Hull, before returning to the Mariners in the summer of 2003 following Grimsby's relegation from the second tier of English football. Following the sacking of Paul Groves and the appointment of Nicky Law, Jevons struck up a good partnership with Isaiah Rankin, he scored four goals in a 6\u20131 victory over Barnsley on 28 February 2004. Despite this the club suffered a second successive relegation, Jevons finished that season with twelve goals and left the club at the end of the season. In total Jevons scored 24 times as a Grimsby Town player."]}, {"page": "Clint Marcelle", "response": ["After training with several non-League clubs in the summer of 2005, Marcelle was given a short-term contract by Gainsborough Trinity, but after a few games at The Northolme he was unable to dislodge Dave Reeves and Jonathan Rowan as the first choice attacking force available to manager Paul Mitchell. It was not long before Trinity would release him."]}, {"page": "Tony Crane", "response": ["In June 2007 he joined former Football League side Boston United on trial, along with fellow former Grimsby players Jonathan Rowan, Matthew Bloomer and Adam Buckley. A month later Crane made the move to Boston a permanent one. Tony slotted in at centre back for the club, and his never say die attitude, that made him popular at Grimsby, saw him become increasingly popular with United fans. His aerial presence had seen him score several headed goals, and Boston boss Tommy Taylor was able to mould his first team defence around Crane. Despite his performances he became increasingly over weight, even more so than when the problem occurred at Grimsby, and once again he became under fire again by his own club manager. Taylor stated that Tony would find it a huge possibility to return to the professional game. but only if he was able to knuckle down and lose the required weight he had gained. Taylor, also commented that his weight was the reason that Crane received at least a yellow card in nearly every game he played in, mentioning that he was slow on challenging and his big frame would often be used against him when in a tussle with an opponent. Crane continued to play week in week out for The Pilgrims, but continued to struggle to budge any weight, and carried on to put on more bulk as the season ran along.HighBeam Following the close of the 2007\u20132008 season, Crane and Boston parted company. He would remain without a club for the entire 2008\u20132009 season and had turned down an offer to join up with Ilkeston Town to concentrate on his new-found fatherhood. In December following the sacking of Tommy Taylor, Boston's new manager Steve Welsh confirmed the club would like to resign Crane, if he was in a fit enough state to play.http://www.sportsecho.co.uk/football/boston_united/news/displayarticle.php?ID=5871 Crane was present in the club's league game at Frickley Athletic and commented a return to United could be on the cards.http://www.bostonstandard.co.uk/boston-united-news/United-reach-for-Crane-lift.4827927.jp However a deal was never struck and Crane would play no part in the entire season."]}, {"page": "Jon Rowan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonathan Rowan "]}, {"page": "Liam Nimmo", "response": ["On 12 September 2003, Nimmo made his Grimsby debut, as a 61st-minute substitute for Jonathan Rowan in an 8\u20131 defeat at Hartlepool United in League One.
