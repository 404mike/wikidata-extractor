Holiness movement theologians Henry Orton Wiley, Carl O. Bangs and J. Kenneth Grider can also be mentioned among recent proponents of Arminianism. Various other theologians or Bible scholars as B. J. Oropeza, Keith D. Stanglin, Craig S. Keener, Thomas H. McCall, and Grant R. Osborne can be mentioned as well.", "Some have alleged that Arminianism is Pelagian or Semi-Pelagian, (denying original sin and total depravity). No system of Arminianism founded on Arminius or Wesley denies original sin or total depravity; both Arminius and Wesley strongly affirmed that man's basic condition is one in which he cannot be righteous, understand God, or seek God. Many Calvinist critics of Arminianism, both historically and currently, claim that Arminianism condones, accepts, or even explicitly supports Pelagianism or semi-Pelagianism. Arminius referred to Pelagianism as \"the grand falsehood\" and stated that he \"must confess that I detest, from my heart, the consequences [of that theology].\" David Pawson, a British pastor, decries this association as \"libelous\" when attributed to Arminius' or Wesley's doctrine. Indeed, most Arminians reject all accusations of Pelagianism; nonetheless, primarily due to Calvinist opponents, the two terms remain intertwined in popular usage."]}, {"page": "Christian Zionism", "response": ["In Defending Christian Zionism, David Pawson, a Christian Zionist in the United Kingdom, puts forward the case that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land is a fulfilment of scriptural prophecy, and that Christians should support the existence of the Jewish State (although not unconditionally its actions) on theological grounds. He also argues that prophecies spoken about Israel relate specifically to Israel (not to the church, as in \"replacement theology\"). However, he criticises Dispensationalism, which he says is a largely American movement holding similar views.

Arminians find the Scriptures describing both the initial act of faith in Christ, \"whereby the relationship is effected\", and the persevering faith in him \"whereby the relationship is sustained.\"Shank, Life in the Son, 92; cf. Arrington, Unconditional Eternal Security: Myth or Truth? 182. Marshall writes: \"The Christian life is a life which is continually sustained by the power of God. It does not merely depend upon a once-for-all gift of God received in the moment of conversion, but is a continual relationship to God in which His gracious gifts are received by faith\" (Kept by the Power, 22). The relationship of \"the believer to Christ is never a static relationship existing as the irrevocable consequence of a past decision, act, or experience.\"Shank, Life in the Son, 116. cf. Williams, Renewal Theology 2:127, 134\u2013135. Brenda Colijn writes: \"Salvation is not a transaction but an ongoing relationship between the Rescuer and the rescued, between the Healer and the healed. The best way to ensure faithfulness is to nurture that relationship. Final salvation, like initial salvation, is appropriated by grace through faith(fulness) (; )... Salvation is not a one-time event completed at conversion. It involves a growth in relationship ... that is not optional or secondary but is essential to what salvation means\" (Images of Salvation in the New Testament, 140\u2013141). Rather, it is a living union \"proceeding upon a living faith in a living Savior.\"Shank, Life in the Son, 116. In another place Shank writes: \"The faith on which our union with Christ depends is not the act of some past moment. It is a present living faith in a living Savior\" (Life in the Son, 66). This living union is captured in the simple command by Christ, \"Remain in me, and I in you\" ().Shank, Life in the Son, 43, 116.", "* David Pawson (1996). Once Saved, Always Saved?
