At this time, the young archaeologist George Bass was working on his PhD at the University and was sent to co-direct the archaeological excavation of the site.  Neither co-director had completed a diving qualification before they arrived but Bass had some practice in a YMCA pool and knew how to swim.  He was also much younger than Taylor, who was well-known and respected within the archaeological community.  The group of divers arrived in 1960 and began to complete the first archaeological excavation of an underwater shipwreck in its entirety, though divers still find missed artefacts on occasion.
