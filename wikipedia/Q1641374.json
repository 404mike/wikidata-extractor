There he built structures, raised livestock, and harvested the meat and eggs of mutton birds.Munro was appointed local constable in 1825, and opposed George Augustus Robinson's attempts to prevent relationships between sealers and Aboriginal women. It is still disputed as to the consensuality of these relationships, with some arguing that the relationships were often voluntary and mutually beneficial, but Munro was also accused of leading sealers in raiding parties to capture Aboriginal women in 1830.", "link_mentions": {}}}
