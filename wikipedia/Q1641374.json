There he built structures, raised livestock, and harvested the meat and eggs of mutton birds.Munro was appointed local constable in 1825, and opposed George Augustus Robinson's attempts to prevent relationships between sealers and Aboriginal women. It is still disputed as to the consensuality of these relationships, with some arguing that the relationships were often voluntary and mutually beneficial, but Munro was also accused of leading sealers in raiding parties to capture Aboriginal women in 1830.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aboriginal Tasmanians", "response": ["There are numerous stories of the sealers' brutality towards the Aboriginal women; with some of these reports originating from Robinson. In 1830, Robinson seized 14 Aboriginal women from the sealers, planning for them to marry Aboriginal men at the Flinders Island settlement. Josephine Flood, an archaeologist specialising in Australian mainland Aboriginal peoples, notes: \"he encountered strong resistance from the women as well as sealers\". The sealers sent a representative, James Munro, to appeal to Governor George Arthur and argue for the women's return, on the basis that they wanted to stay with their sealer husbands and children rather than marry Aboriginal men unknown to them. Arthur ordered the return of some of the women. Shortly thereafter, Robinson began to disseminate stories, told to him by James Munro, of atrocities allegedly committed by the sealers against Aboriginal people, and against Aboriginal women in particular. Brian Plomley, who edited Robinson's papers, expressed scepticism about these atrocities and notes that they were not reported to Archdeacon William Broughton's 1830 committee of inquiry into violence towards Tasmanians. Abduction and ill-treatment of Aboriginal Tasmanians certainly occurred, but the extent is debated."]}, {"page": "Cape Barren Island", "response": ["Cape Barren Island (Palawa kani: truwana), part of the Furneaux Group, is a  island in the Bass Strait, off the north east coast of Tasmania, Australia.
