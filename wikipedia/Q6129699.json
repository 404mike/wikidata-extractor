Rovers' first league game took place on 15 September 1888 at Leamington Road, then home of Blackburn Rovers, when Rovers shared ten goals in an exciting encounter with Accrington. Southworth converted a cross from Harry Fecitt to score Blackburn's first goal in the league. The other scorers for Blackburn were James Beresford, Billy Townley (2) and Fecitt. Southworth scored his first hat-trick (he scored 2 in 1888-1889) for Blackburn at Burnley in November. He also scored two-League-goals-in-a-match twice. In the FA Cup match against Aston Villa Southworth scored four goals as Blackburn registered an 8\u20131 victory, before going out in the semi-final to Wolves. Blackburn ended the inaugural League season in fourth place; Southworth missed only one of the 22 league games and was Blackburn's top scorer with seventeen league goals, plus four in the cup. As a forward he played in a forward-line that scored three-League-goals-or-more-in-a-match on 11 separate occasions.
