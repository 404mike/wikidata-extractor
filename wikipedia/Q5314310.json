An idea becoming realised, Stuart's brother and keyboard player, Struan Eaglesham, was offered a place in the line-up, as was piper Allan Wilson from Bonar Bridge. Roger Niven from the Black Isle played guitar, but was soon replaced by Andy Murray. In 1989, Wolfstone performed their opening show at the first Highland Traditional Music Festival in Dingwall, supplemented by sequenced bass and drums. Following this, the band ran the usual Highlands and Islands village dance hall circuit, gaining live experience. It was clear that this was a worthwhile venture, the gigs earning them more than their day jobs. During this period, Wolfstone recorded two albums - Wolfstone and Wolfstone II respectively - on Rowan Records, utilising sequencing machines over a standard rhythm section. These albums were produced by David Foster, who also contributed vocals to some of the tracks. However, he parted ways with Wolfstone in 1990 over disagreement on the band's direction. Also in 1990, Orcadian Ivan Drever joined the band on vocals, guitars, and songwriting duties. Soon, Wolfstone were offered a recording contract with Iona Records in Glasgow, and in 1991, began work on Unleashed, allowing them to guest drummer John Henderson and bassist Neil Hay for a decidedly more authentic sound. Mid-process, they were offered a support slot at Runrig's major Loch Lomond Midsummer event,Morton, Tom: Going Home, page 200. Mainstream, 1991.  alongside such acts as CapercaillieMorton, Tom: Going Home, page 201, 202. Mainstream, 1991. and Hothouse Flowers.Morton, Tom: Going Home, page 197, 201. Mainstream, 1991. This exposure brought the band larger gigs and shows, playing to new audiences. Ultimately, Unleashed was a success, achieving silver status in the UK.", "1992 saw Wolfstone enter the studio once again to record their follow-up album, The Chase. By this time, piper Allan Wilson had left the band, and his position was filled for several years by a string of different session musicians, including Roddy McCourt, Dougie Pincock, Gordon Duncan and Martyn Bennett. The Chase proved a success, achieving gold status. The band were once again made busy touring, with the addition of TV appearances, for example the 1993 edition of Children in Need. An EP entitled Burning Horizons was released in 1993, consolidating bassist Wayne Mackenzie and drummer Mop Youngson as full-time members. In 1994, Wolfstone signed to Green Linnet Records, which consequently saw the release of Year of the Dog. About this time, the Celtic Records label reissued the band's early albums, Wolfstone and Wolfstone II.  Duncan Chisholm says: \"We disown those two albums. The band we are in does not reflect what was going on then; a different line up with different ideas and objectives; anyone buying those two albums is not buying a Wolfstone recording. We would never promote them and we certainly wouldn't sell them to anyone.\" Despite this, the first of these albums received a positive reception from AllMusic. In late 1994, the position of piper was finally consolidated when Stevie Saint joined the band full-time. He has remained in the line-up ever since. In 1996, Wolfstone released their fourth album, The Half Tail.", "Wolfstone perform pieces from the traditional folk and Celtic repertoire permeated with rock and roll sensibilities. This was perhaps most obvious on the early Wolfstone and Wolfstone II albums which featured prominent walking bass-lines. As well as this, the band is also a source of both original tunes and songs. Previous material stemmed, though not exclusively, from collaborations between Ivan Drever and Duncan Chisholm, as well as Drever's own compositions. Only more recently have Duncan Chisholm and Stuart Eaglesham written songs together. Wolfstone's songs vary greatly in subject matter. They explore emigration and displacement (\"Burning Horizons\", \"Braes of Sutherland\"), social injustice (\"Close It Down\", \"Brave Foot Soldiers\") and conflict (\"White Gown\", \"Brave Boys\"), amongst other things.

Furthermore, the band could not \"really plan any future work as Wolfstone\" whilst still under the contract of their record label Green Linnet Records.
