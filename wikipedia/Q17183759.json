He then became a founder member of the National Democratic Party (NDP).Caraher became a teacher of English and politics, working in a Belfast grammar school. The NDP became part of the new Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and Caraher immediately became one of its main political theorists.  He was part of the team which drafted the party's constitution, organised the Belfast section of the party, and was elected as its first vice-chairman.Caraher stood unsuccessfully for the SDLP on numerous occasions: in South Belfast at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election; in Belfast Area A at the 1973 Northern Ireland local elections; in the South Belfast Parliament constituency at the February and October 1974 general elections; in the 1975 Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention election in the equivalent Assembly seat; in Belfast Area C at the 1981 Northern Ireland local elections; and finally at the 1982 Northern Ireland Assembly election. It was in 1982 that he came closest to winning a seat, taking fourth place, but narrowly missing out on transfers.At the 1985 Northern Ireland local elections, Caraher acted as election agent for Dorita Field, who stood unsuccessfully in the Balmoral area.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Democratic Party (Northern Ireland)", "response": ["The next few years saw the start of The Troubles, and great radicalisation among Irish nationalists.  Brennan lost his seat in 1969.  Hume founded the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), bringing together independent nationalist politicians elected in 1969 and some representatives of existing parties.  A large number of NDP members left to join the SDLP - making up 80% of its first 400 members.  Facing a massive drop in membership, the NDP dissolved itself in October 1970, passing a resolution that all members should join the SDLP.  These members included political strategist Ben Caraher, who was to greatly influence the approach of the early SDLP.Jorg Neuheiser and Stefan Wolff, Peace at Last?"]}, {"page": "1981 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Ben Caraher"]}, {"page": "Belfast Area A", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Ben Caraher"]}, {"page": "Belfast Area C", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Ben Caraher"]}, {"page": "John Caraher", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Caraher"]}, {"page": "John Bernard Caraher", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Caraher"]}]}}
