Rieu", "response": ["Rieu was born in London, the youngest child of the Swiss Orientalist Charles Pierre Henri Rieu (1820\u20131902), and his wife Agnes, daughter of Julius Heinrich Hisgen of Hamburg.  He was a scholar of St Paul's School and Balliol College, Oxford, gaining a first in Classical Honours Moderations in 1908. In 1914 he married Nelly Lewis, daughter of a Pembrokeshire businessman. They had two sons (one of them was D. C. H. Rieu) and two daughters. Rieu died in London in 1972.", "Rieu became best known for his lucid translations of Homer and for a modern translation of the four Gospels which evolved from his role as editor of a projected (but aborted) Penguin translation of the Bible. Though he had been a lifelong agnostic, his experience translating the Gospels brought him to change and join the Church of England.Blaiklock, E. M. \"More and more, Scripture lives\". Christianity Today, 1973, pp. 1293\u20131297. His translation of the Odyssey, 1946, was the opener of the Penguin Classics, a series that he founded with Sir Allen Lane and edited from 1944 to 1964. According to his son, \"[h]is vision was to make available to the ordinary reader, in good modern English, the great classics of every language.\"D. C. H. Rieu's preface to The Odyssey (Penguin, 2003), p. vii.", "Often, though, he embroidered Homer's verse, following the principle that has since become known as dynamic equivalence or thought-for-thought translation.

Some of his renderings seem anachronistic or in the wrong linguistic register: \"the meeting adjourned,\" \"I could fancy him,\" and, \"It's the kind of thing that gives a girl a good name in town.\" He sometimes discarded Homer's anonymous immortals: \"A god put this into my mind\" became \"It occurred to me.\" Rieu also tended to make the characters more courteous by preceding orders with \"Kindly...\" or \"Be good enough to...\" Some of these foibles were amended in a revision made by his son D. C. H. Rieu, who also translated The Acts of the Apostles by Saint Luke (1957) for the Penguin series. The sole contemporary rival to his prose translation of the Iliad was a verse translation by Richmond Lattimore.For more on this see English translations of Homer#Rieu."]}, {"page": "D.C.H.
