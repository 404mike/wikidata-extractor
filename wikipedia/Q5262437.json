After graduating from RADA in 1957, his earliest television work was on the BBC's cycle of Shakespeare's history plays, An Age of Kings (1960), as both actor and stunt arranger. For the director Peter Watkins, Ware was involved in the production of the docudramas, Culloden (1964) and The War Game (1966), both for the BBC.Ware was a stuntman and fight arranger for the early seasons of Doctor Who on which his company Havoc, founded in 1966, was involved as well as many other television shows into the 1970s, for both the BBC and ITV. The company entirely dominating the stunt work field for a time, but had been dissolved by the end of the 1970s. He worked on Z-Cars, the original The Italian Job (1969), in which he also played the role of Rozzer, and later, on EastEnders.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Inferno (Doctor Who)", "response": ["Stuntman Derek Ware did not actually perform the stunt in which his character, the mutated RSF Trooper Wyatt, having been shot, falls to his death from the top of one of the chemical tanks, in case he was injured (since he was also needed for the subsequent studio recording). His place was taken by Roy Scammell, who (ironically) also played the soldier who fired the fatal shot. Ware stated in an interview that Scammell had already signed the contract to do the fall before Ware had been cast as Wyatt.
