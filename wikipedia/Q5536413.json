She told a reporter at the time, \"I don't want to wait myself out of this business, but working for Hitch and Charlie has been very special to me, and now I'm going to wait for something special to come along\". In 1968, she signed on to do the American Civil War drama Five Against Kansas with Farley Granger and Jeffrey Hunter, but the project was never realized.Green, Paul. Jeffrey Hunter: The Film, Television, Radio and Stage Performances, McFarland & Co Inc, 2014; , p. 124. In 1968, Hedren returned to film as a socialite who helps her boyfriend (played by George Armstrong) catch a killer, in Tiger by the Tail. From 1970 to 1971, she guest-starred twice on The Courtship of Eddie's Father. She agreed to take part in Satan's Harvest (1970) and Mister Kingstreet's War (1973)\u2014which were shot back-to-back despite the discrepancy in their release dates\u2014for the sole reason that they were being filmed in Africa. In 1973, Hedren played a teacher of an experimental sex school in The Harrad Experiment, which starred James Whitmore and Don Johnson\u2014the latter who later became the husband of her daughter, Melanie Griffith. Hedren felt that the film \"deals with vital themes\u2014themes like the decline in importance of ideas like possession and jealousy and, by inference, marriage. I have four teenaged children and I think this picture says some valuable things to them.\" She confessed at the time she was occasionally depressed because she was not doing any major films and told a magazine, \"My husband just cancelled all the trade magazines because he felt I should cut off the source of my discontent. He's the type who won't stand for sustained down feelings\"."]}, {"page": "George Armstrong", "response": ["George Armstrong may refer to:", "* George Armstrong (New Zealand politician) (1822\u20131905), Member of Parliament in Canterbury, New Zealand", "* George Armstrong (Manitoba politician) (1870\u20131956), Canadian politician and labour activist", "* George Armstrong (cricketer) (1882\u20131956), Australian cricketer", "* George Armstrong (baseball) (1924\u20131993), American baseball player", "* George Armstrong (ice hockey) (1930\u20132021), Canadian ice hockey player", "* George Armstrong (footballer) (1944\u20132000), English football player", "* George Armstrong (physician) (c. 1720\u20131789), English physician", "* George Armstrong (engineer) (1822\u20131901), English railway engineer", "* George Armstrong (actor) (born 1962), English actor", "* George Armstrong Custer (1839\u20131876), United States Army officer and cavalry commander in the American Civil War and the Indian Wars"]}, {"page": "Tucker's Luck", "response": ["Tucker's Luck followed the exploits of Tucker and his friends, Alan Humphries (George Armstrong) and Tommy Watson (Paul McCarthy), after they had left school and their attempts to find employment and cope out there in the \"real world\".
