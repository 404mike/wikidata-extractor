Born at Ballylough, in County Antrim, William Atcheson Traill was educated in private schools and graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a degree in Engineering in 1865 and a Master's in 1873. In 1868 he joined the Geological Survey of Ireland, becoming an expert on water supply. In 1881 he left, and with his brother Anthony he founded the Portrush, Bushmills, and Giant's Causeway Railway and Tramway Company. This operated the world's first electrical railway, and was funded by capital raised from friends and investors including Sir Walter Siemens and Lord Kelvin. Traill devised and patented a conduit system of burying the live rail in a pipe with electrical contact. The expected goods trade never took off, and the line remained until its closure 1949 as a summer tourist railway. In February 1887 he ran in a by-election in North Antrim as an Independent Unionist, coming in third. He married three times, and met his third wife, Nora Westwood, in 1895 when he rescued her from drowning.In 1990, the Northern Bank issued a banknote bearing a portrait of Traill.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Giant's Causeway Tramway", "response": ["The Giant's Causeway Tramway came about through the enthusiasm of William Atcheson Traill, M.A.Ing., of Ballylough (1844\u20131934), together with his brother Dr Anthony Traill, who between them undertook most of the promotion and fundraising for the line. W.A. Traill was a man with not only an interest in railways but also a keen interest in technological developments in engineering. The Act of Parliament incorporating 'The Giant's Causeway, Portrush, and Bush Valley Railway and Tramway Company' was passed on 26 August 1880. It authorised a tramway from Portrush to Bushmills and a railway from there to join the Ballycastle Railway (also 3\u00a0ft. gauge) at Dervock. The only section of the railway ever built was a short spur at Dervock. The Dervock section was abandoned by an 1885 Act, which authorised extension from Bushmills to the Causeway."]}, {"page": "Traill (surname)", "response": ["William Atcheson Traill (1844\u20131933) was an Irish engineer and co-founder of the Giant's Causeway Railway and Tramway Company, opened in 1887.", "* William Atcheson Traill (1844\u20131933), Irish engineer"]}, {"page": "William Acheson Traill", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Atcheson Traill"]}, {"page": "Northern Bank \u00a35 note", "response": ["| series 1988\u20131990|| 1988 || Green || 136 \u00d7 70 mm || William Atcheson Traill ||"]}, {"page": "Atcheson", "response": ["*William Atcheson Traill (1844\u20131933), a politician in Ontario, Canada"]}]}}
