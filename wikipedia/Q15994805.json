Due to their relatively microscopic size ranging between 4-12 microns, they are further distinguished as heterotrophic nanoflagellates. This small size ratio limits them as bacterivores that swim around feeding on bacteria attached to surfaces or in aggregates.", "The order Neobodonida was proposed by a researcher, Keith Vickerman, based on significant characteristics that differed from the original bodonid species. Differing characteristics included: being phagotrophic, Polykinetoplastic/eukinetoplastic, biflagellate with usually both flagella lacking hairs, having a posterior flagellum attached to the body or free of it, and having an apical cytostome. Many Neobodo species derived from Bodo species, and by recognizing these differences, they were tentatively assigned to the new genus Neobodo by adding the \u2018neo\u2019 prefix. Through studies on the ultrastructure of Bodo designis, researchers discovered the possession of a \u2018microtubular prism\u2019 supporting the cytostome\u2013cytopharynx, as well as a significantly different feeding apparatus from other bodonids, thus proposing the new species as Neobodo designis. Through this discovery, they were proposed as the type species of the new genus Neobodo. Neobodo have very close connections with Kinetoplastid protists. Kinetoplastid protists belong together with euglenids and diplonemids, to the phylum Euglenozoa, and are grouped in the class Kinetoplastea. The name of kinetoplastid is derived from the presence of a characteristic structure called the kinetoplast which is a mass of concentrated extranuclear DNA within a mitochondrion. In the past, kinetoplastids were classified into two major suborder groups via morphology-based taxonomic criteria: either as parasitic uniflagellate trypanosomatids, or biflagellate bodonids. Originally, Vickerman proposed two families, Bodonidae and Cryptobiidae, but later on re-unified all bodonids within the single family, Bodonidae. Based on comparisons of RNA sequences and molecular phylogenetic analyses, it was suggested that the trypanosomatids also emerged from within the bodonids. Moreover, recent research of deep-sea hydrothermal vent samples at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and analysis via PCR amplification reported several new kinetoplastid-like sequences. Researchers David Moreira, Purificacion Lopez-Garc\u0131a, and Keith Vickerman analyzed the phylogeny of these kinetoplastids and found a much more stable phylogeny that supported the monophyly of groups that typically emerged as polyphyletic in the trees rooted using the traditional, distant outgroup sequences. As a result, the classification of the class Kinetoplastea was divided as two new subclasses: "]}]}}
