He was born in Dublin on 11 December 1872 to a French mother and an English father. He went to Paris to study engineering, but embarked on an artistic career after meeting and taking drawing lessons from the French satirist and political cartoonist Caran d'Ache (Emmanuel Poir\u00e9). Bull returned to Ireland to contribute sketches and political cartoons to various publications, including the 'Weekly Freeman'.\nMoving to London in 1892, Bull drew for \"Illustrated Brits\" and created cartoons in the style of Caran d'Ache for 'Pick-Me-Up' from 1893. In 1896 Bull joined Black and White illustrated newspaper as a special artist and photographer. In 1898, he covered the Tirah Campaign in India and went on to Sudan for the campaign culminating in the Battle of Omdurman. He went to South Africa to record the Boer War until the relief of Ladysmith in March 1900. As he was wounded in 1900, Bull was invalided out.\nHe settled in England and drew cartoons for such magazines as Bystander, Chums, London Opinion, Lika Joko. In The Sketch Bull created cartoons of humorous inventions, predating those of William Heath Robinson. From 1905 he illustrated books, starting with an edition of Fontaine's 'Fables'. Other major titles he illustrated included The Arabian Nights (1912), Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m (1913), The Russian Ballet (1913), Carmen (1915), Andersen's Fairy Tales.

Much of this was continued research from his work with \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey. Bull's work as an assistant with Marey, particularly in regards to developing Marey's camera gun into the higher speed spark-drum camera, was instrumental in the development of the technique of chronophotography, and was key to his appointment as head of the Marey Institute. Chronophotography itself acted as a stepping stone to the development of cinematography and silent film. The lasting effects of the technique are observable to this day, as it provided a foundation for modern cinema. Some of Bull's work has been preserved to this day.
