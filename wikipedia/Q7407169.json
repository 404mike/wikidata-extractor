The album included several interesting collaborations including the title track \"Buying Time\" which had been written by the Nottingham-based singer-songwriter Sam Beeton. Duets with Maxi Priest and former RCA Records artist Sonna Rele worked well, as did a track called \"Is This Love\" which featured a sample from the soundtrack to the 1977 film Il Gatto by film composer Ennio Morricone. The sample had also been cleared and approved by the composer with kind permission of his publishers Kassner Music. In May 2011, promotional work had begun on Miss 600's debut single entitled \"Twist\". The single quickly found support from many regional radio stations and newspapers including the Derby Telegraph, Nottingham Post, and Bliss magazine. They also received support from a growing number of producers at BBC Radio 2. That support culminated in \"Twist\" being placed on the BBC Radio 2 B playlist on 15 June. They then went on to Radio 2 A playlist where it remained for seven weeks."]}, {"page": "Carlton le Willows Academy", "response": ["The school and its forerunner institutions have educated notable figures in a wide range of fields.
