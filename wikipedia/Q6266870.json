He made 27 full appearances and two as substitute in that season, including City's 2\u20131 defeat in the League Cup final against Wolves.Manchester; The Greatest City. James, Gary. Polar Publishing, 1997. p222. In City's last game of the 1973\u201374 season against Manchester United at Old Trafford, Law's 81st-minute back-heeled goal gave City a 1\u20130 lead but, thinking his goal might relegate United, Law did not celebrate the goal. Results of the day's other matches meant that United were relegated whatever their result, but Law did not know that at the time. A number of pitch invasions by United fans followed, and Law walked off the pitch with his head down as he was substituted. The pitch invasions forced the referee to abandon the game in the 85th minute. After a review, the Football League decided that the result should stand."]}, {"page": "Paul Hart", "response": ["The son of Johnny Hart, a football inside forward and manager, Hart had five-year spells with both Blackpool and Leeds United, and also played for Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday, amongst others."]}, {"page": "Uwe R\u00f6sler", "response": ["After an ignominious start to the 1994\u201395 campaign, when he was sent off in a 3\u20130 opening day defeat at Arsenal, R\u00f6sler formed a productive partnership with Paul Walsh, and scored 22 league and cup goals despite missing several games through injury. In an FA cup match against Notts County he scored four goals, becoming the first Manchester City player to score four in an FA Cup tie since Johnny Hart in 1953. His performances that season meant he was the club's leading goalscorer, and he won the club's Player of the Year award."]}, {"page": "Rodney Marsh", "response": ["Marsh became City's top-scorer, scoring 19 goals in 1972\u201373. However the club entered into a decline when Allison resigned in March 1973; over the next year Johnny Hart, Tony Book and Ron Saunders all had spells as City manager. The \"Sky Blues\" finished 11th in 1972\u201373 and 14th in 1973\u201374. They did though reach the final of the League Cup in 1974, losing 2\u20131 to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Wembley.

As other teams pulled out, Manchester City agreed to take part in the 1972 FA Charity Shield, and they took the shield back to Maine Road with a 1\u20130 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park. However, he was restricted to just 15 appearances in 1972\u201373, as City ended the campaign in 11th place under the management of Johnny Hart. Oakes returned to post 33 appearances in 1973\u201374, the season in which Denis Law famously sent Manchester United out of the top-flight. New boss Tony Book failed to bring back the glory years for Manchester City though, despite Oakes making 43 appearances in 1974\u201375. Playing 50 games in 1975\u201376, his final honour with the club was the League Cup medal he picked up in 1976, with a 2\u20131 victory over Newcastle United."]}, {"page": "Tony Book", "response": ["In November 1973, Manchester City manager Johnny Hart resigned due to ill health, and Book took temporary responsibility for first-team affairs, and was named assistant manager when Ron Saunders became the next permanent manager. At this point Book retired from playing to concentrate on management. Saunders was sacked after less than six months, and Book again took on the caretaker role, and was appointed permanent manager one game later. The first notable victory of Book's management was a 1\u20130 Manchester derby win, best known for the back-heel scored by Denis Law.The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p37 Book's first full season as manager resulted in an eighth-place finish, an improvement upon the previous season, when the team finished 14th. In 1976, Book's City side won the League Cup, making him the first person to win the competition as both player and manager. City continued their run of form into the following season, enjoying an impressive league campaign where they finished in second place, only a point behind winners Liverpool. City were playing entertaining football in the late 1970s and regularly drawing crowds at Maine Road in excess of 40,000. Book remained manager until 1979, when he was replaced by his former mentor Malcolm Allison. He then became a loyal stalwart to the club in several other roles until 1997, including as caretaker manager again in 1993.Soccerbase: Tony Book's managerial career He joined Huddersfield Town in 1997 as Chief Scout under Brian Horton."]}, {"page": "Golborne", "response": ["* Johnny Hart (1928-2018), professional football player and manager", "* Paul Hart (born 1953), professional footballer and son of Johnny Hart"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. managers", "response": ["During Peter Swales' time as Manchester City chairman the tenure of managers was frequently brief, as between 1973 and 1994 eleven managers were appointed.  The first of these was Ron Saunders, after ill health had forced Johnny Hart to leave the post. Saunders was sacked after only six months, and club stalwart Tony Book took over. Book managed the club for five years, winning the League Cup in 1976. Malcolm Allison, who had rejoined the coaching staff in January 1979, made an ill-fated return to the manager's role later that year, a spell noted more for financial excess than on-pitch success. A further six managers (John Bond, John Benson, Billy McNeill, Jimmy Frizzell, Mel Machin and Howard Kendall) were appointed in the 1980s, with none lasting more than three years amid a series of promotions and relegations. An upturn in results occurred during Peter Reid's management, the club achieving consecutive fifth-place finishes, but a deterioration in Reid's relationship with the board signalled the end of his spell at the club.Everything Under the Blue Moon, p172 Brian Horton arrived from Oxford to sceptical newspaper headlines of \"Brian Who?\", but developed a reputation for attractive football.Blue Moon Rising, p90 Swales was replaced as chairman by former City striker Francis Lee.

Tommy Docherty, the 44-year-old Scottish national coach and former Aston Villa manager, was appointed as his successor, and steered them to survival. Neighbours Manchester City had a similarly poor campaign and were nearly relegated only a year after narrowly missing out on the title, but recovered well to finish safely in mid-table after manager Malcolm Allison was replaced by Johnny Hart late in the season."]}]}}
