Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, he is a resident of Morocco. His last name is sometimes published as McCarthy.\nIn 1992, having presented falsified documentation regarding his ancestry for official perusal, MacCarthy gained Chief of the Name recognition as the MacCarthy M\u00f3r. He worked to organise an affiliation of clan associations in Ireland and North America, building on heritage tourism. He also became active in the International Commission on Orders of Chivalry (ICOC), in which position he promoted an order known as the Niadh Nask. His claims were challenged in 1999 by The Sunday Times, which had conducted an investigation of his ancestry and found that his father was an ordinary working man in Belfast. Later that year, recognition of MacCarthy was withdrawn and he resigned the title; in 2003 the government discontinued the practice of granting courtesy honours to Chiefs of the Name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of impostors", "response": ["* Terence Francis MacCarthy (born 1957), styled himself MacCarthy M\u00f3r and \"Prince of Desmond\""]}, {"page": "Chief of the Name", "response": ["After genealogical errors in the 1990s saw Terence Francis MacCarthy and other impostors receive recognition, the Irish government decided in July 2003 to abandon this practice.

On 28 January 1992, the Irish Genealogical Office conferred courtesy Chief of the Name recognition to Terence MacCarthy as the MacCarthy M\u00f3r, the title of the chief of the MacCarthy sept or clan.The title literally means \"the great MacCarthy.\" The MacCarthys had been princes of Desmond, and earlier, through the Eoghanacht of Cashel, the kings of Munster. Terence MacCarthy claimed the title based on tanistry rather than primogeniture, and said that his father renounced the title in his favour in 1980. He led an affiliation of MacCarthy clan associations in Ireland, Canada, and the United States, which appealed to heritage tourism trends of the time. This recognition by the prestigious Irish Genealogical Office allowed him to gain credibility in nobiliary circles in the world, so it was easy for him to be the founder of the self-styled Irish chivalric Order the Niadh Nask, and to fraudulently claim to be \"Prince of Desmond\" the MacCarthy M\u00f2r. ", "Since the Niadh Nask was heretofore unknown within the world of chivalric orders, Robert Gayre and the ICOC expanded the original focus of the group to include a new category, called \"Dynastic Nobiliary Fraternities\". Hundreds of people, taken in by these claims, joined the Niadh Nask or donated to their \"cause\", totaling about $1 million. Among those convinced by the hoax were former Irish Prime Ministers Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds, and John Brooke-Little. After Gayre's death in 1996, Terence Francis MacCarthy assumed the position of President and continued using the ICOC as a vehicle to advance his fraudulent nobiliary claims. In July 1999, the falsity of Terence Francis MacCarthy's claims was discovered and reported in the media, and he resigned from the ICOC.Sean J.
