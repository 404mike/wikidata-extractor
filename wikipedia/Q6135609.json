His real interests lay in being a sportsman, and he was known for his meticulous records of what game he had killed and of the local and national British weather. He built up an extensive collection of stuffed game, which was donated to various museums.\nHe was Member of Parliament (MP) for Helston 1802\u20131804, Horsham 1804\u20131806, Heytesbury 1807\u20131812 and Wilton 1816\u20131820.", "link_mentions": {}}}
