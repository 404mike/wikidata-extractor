He currently works as a coach with the  England U21s. \nLescott is a graduate of the Wolverhampton Wanderers youth academy. He made his first-team debut with Wolves in 2000 and he was named the supporters' Young Player of the Year two years running. He was a regular player as the club won promotion to Premier League in 2003, but missed the whole season through injury and they were relegated. He was named in the Championship team of the year for the 2005\u201306 season, and subsequently moved to Premier League club Everton for a total of \u00a35 million in August 2006. He was voted Player's Player of the Season by his teammates in the following two seasons. Lescott moved to Manchester City in August 2009 for a reported \u00a322 million and spent five seasons at the club, winning two league titles, an FA Cup and a League Cup.

Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen. Then, in August 2008, the club was purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for \u00a332.5\u00a0million. There wasn't a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over \u00a3100\u00a0million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Tour\u00e9, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott.
