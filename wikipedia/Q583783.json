In the 1990s she became known as a writer of chick lit novels under her maiden name Louise Bagshawe. She was elected Conservative MP for Corby at the 2010 UK general election.Mensch resigned as an MP in August 2012 to move to New York City to live with her second husband, American music manager Peter Mensch. She began working for News Corp in 2014, and co-launched its Heat Street website in February 2016. Since leaving Heat Street in December 2016, she has published primarily on her blog Patribotics, which she launched in January 2017, and her Twitter account. She left News Corp entirely in March 2017.\nMensch and Heat Street have since courted controversy by promoting unverified claims, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories about the Trump administration and its ties to the Russian Federation.Among other allegations she has posted online, Mensch claimed that she had obtained evidence that Russian president Vladimir Putin had American conservative commentator Andrew Breitbart, the founder of Breitbart News who died of a heart attack in 2012, murdered so his job would go to his deputy, Steve Bannon. She has stated that the 2017 Istanbul nightclub shooting, which was perpetrated by Abdulkadir Masharipov on behalf of the terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, was a Russian false flag operation with Russia posing as ISIL.She has stated that \"Bannon and his team\" were behind the 2017 Jewish Community Center bomb threats that were committed by two people, American Juan M. Thompson and Israeli-American Michael David Kadar, with no ties to Bannon. She has claimed Russian intelligence planted inflammatory emails implicating former U.S. Senator and 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on disgraced former U.S. House member Anthony Weiner's computer. Mensch has also, without evidence, accused numerous people, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, of being Russian \"shills\", \"moles\" and \"agents of influence\".Buzzfeed called Mensch an \"anti\u2013Russian influence crusader\" and one of a number of \"anti-Trump public figures [who] share unreliable information\". Zack Beauchamp, a reporter for Vox who has written at length about Mensch, has said she was the equivalent of an Alex Jones of the right: \"I would say the closest analog would be Infowars\", he said.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court", "response": ["In November 2016, Louise Mensch reported on the news website Heat Street that, after an initial June 2016 FBI request was denied, the FISA court had granted a more narrowly-focused October request from the FBI \"to examine the activities of 'U.S. persons' in Donald Trump's campaign with ties to Russia\".  On 12 January 2017, BBC journalist Paul Wood reported that, in response to an April 2016 tip from a foreign intelligence agency to the CIA about \"money from the Kremlin going into the US presidential campaign\", a joint taskforce had been established including representatives of the FBI, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Agency. In June 2016, lawyers from the Department of Justice applied to the FISA court for \"permission to intercept the electronic records from two Russian banks\". According to Wood, this application was rejected, as was a more narrowly focused request in July, and the order was finally granted by a different FISA judge on 15 October, three weeks before the presidential election.

Since creation it has been a marginal seat alternating between Labour and the Conservative representatives with marginal majorities relative to national averages on all but two occasions, the 1997 Labour landslide and the 2012 by-election.  The first Member of Parliament elected for the constituency in 1983 was William Powell, who represented the Conservatives for three sessions of Parliament until 1997.  Labour then held the seat until 2010.

Labour's Andy Sawford won, becoming the first Labour MP for the seat since Phil Hope was defeated in 2010, and only the second in the seat's history. This was  Labour's first by-election win from a Conservative since the 1997 Wirral South by-election.  At the 2015 general election Tom Pursglove standing for the Conservatives won with a small majority.

Reporting on accusations that Hunt had been taken out of context, conflicting recollections of the phrase \"now seriously\" became a focal point for many commentators.
