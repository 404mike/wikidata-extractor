Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no.. Reed told Brown that there was no one in the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address \"George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.\", but it was again declined.. The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, \"Those who have committed no fault want no pardon.\" Patterson departed soon after.
