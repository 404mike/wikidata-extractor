He was also an orchid enthusiast.Born the second son of William Smee, accountant-general to the Bank of England, Alfred Smee entered in November 1829 St Paul's School, London and in October 1834 became a medical student at King's College, London. During most of his student life, he lived at his father's official residence within the Bank of England and there did research on chemistry and electro-metallurgy which made him famous a few years later. After King's College, he entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, became a surgical assistant to Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet, and received in April 1840 his diploma as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Smee became a consulting surgeon at the London Institution and specialised in diseases of the eye. During this time as a consulting surgeon he also continued his chemical and electro-metallurgical research and developed the Smee's battery (zinc plate and silver plate, coated with platinum black, in sulphuric acid), for which he was awarded the gold Isis medal from the Society of Arts. In 1840 he published a valuable treatise on electro-metallury dealing with the principles of reduction of metals in different states.\nHe was appointed surgeon to the Bank of England in January 1841, a post which had been especially created for him by the directors, upon the recommendation of Sir Astley Cooper, who thought that the bank could turn his scientific genius to good account. He invented a durable writing-ink in 1842, and in 1854, with Mr. Hensman, the engineer, and Mr. Coe, the superintendent of printing at the bank, perfected the present system of printing the cheques and notes. Certain modifications were introduced into the manufacture of the notes to prevent or render it impossible any longer to split them. His paper on \u2018New Bank of England Note and the Substitution of Surface Printing from Electrotypes for Copperplate Printing\u2019 was read before the Society of Arts in 1854. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 10 June 1841, and in February 1842 he became surgeon to the Royal General Dispensary in Aldersgate Street.\nHis 1849 treatise Elements of Electro-Biology was a pioneering effort in electrical physiology and in 1850 a popular version was published with the title Instinct and Reason. At the London Institution he helped to establish in 1854 a long-lived system of educational lectures.Smee is credited with the first sighting (29 June 1861) of the Great Comet of 1861 in the northern hemisphere (previously discovered on 13 May 1861 in the southern hemisphere by John Tebbutt).\nIn the later part of his life Smee maintained an experimental garden at Wallington Bridge, in the hamlet of Wallington, in the parish of Beddington, in the county of Surrey; the garden covered 7.925 acres of land and water.He married Elizabeth Hutchison on 2 June 1840 in London. They had a son and two daughters. Elizabeth Mary Smee (1843-1919) married William Odling and published a memoir of her father in 1878. Alfred Hutchison Smee (1841\u20131901) became a physician who was elected a Fellow of the Chemical Society and a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. Alfred Hutchison Smee cultivated orchids and created experimental hybrids; the orchid Saccolabium smeeanum Rchb. f. is named for him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lemon battery", "response": ["From 1840 to the late 19th century, large, voltaic cells using a zinc electrode and a sulfuric acid electrolyte were widely used in the printing industry. While copper electrodes like those in lemon batteries were sometimes used, in 1840 Alfred Smee invented a refined version of this cell that used silver with a rough platinum coating instead of a copper electrode. Hydrogen gas clinging to the surface of a silver or copper electrode reduces the electric current that can be drawn from a cell; the phenomenon is called \"polarization\". The roughened, \"platinized\" surface speeds up the bubbling of the hydrogen gas, and increases the current from the cell. Unlike the zinc electrode, the copper or platinized silver electrodes are not consumed by using the battery, and the details of this electrode do not affect the cell's voltage. The Smee cell was convenient for electrotyping, which produced copper plates for letterpress printing of newspapers and books, and also statues and other metallic objects."]}, {"page": "Andrew Crosse", "response": ["Other scientists tried to repeat the experiment. W. H. Weeks took extensive measures to assure a sealed environment by placing his experiment inside a bell jar. He obtained the same results as Crosse, but due to the controversy that Crosse's experiment had sparked his work was never published. In February 1837 many newspapers reported that Michael Faraday had also replicated Crosse's results. However, this was not true. Faraday had not even attempted the experiment. Later researchers, such as fellow members of the London Electrical Society Henry Noad and Alfred Smee, were unable to replicate Crosse's results."]}, {"page": "St Peter, Westcheap", "response": ["In 1834\u201335 Leigh Hunt wrote of it, \"there is a tree occupying the space of a house in that most civic and populous thoroughfare\" (i.e. Cheapside). \"It stands at the corner of Wood Street\":Leigh Hunt, 'Introduction' to 'The Streets of the Metropolis', in London Journal Volumes 1 and 2 (1834\u20131835), Supplement for Part I, p. iv, col. 3 (Google). the point of his words was that it was highly conspicuous. By 1848 he added that it was \"ostentatiously visible\". In 1850 Alfred Smee commented that there were then four rooks' nests in it, and that having walked past that tree every day for twenty years he could remember when the first nest appeared.A. Smee, Instinct and Reason: Deduced from Electro-Biology (Reeve and Benham, London 1850), p. 142 (Internet Archive). In 1870 the Revd. Sparrow Simpson (a respected antiquary, father of the librettist of that name) stated that the rooks had gone, though one of their nests remained \"tenanted by a colony of audacious sparrows\". He added that the rooks were said to have been shot with an air-gun from the windows of a neighbouring warehouse by some idle apprentice.Simpson, 'Antiquities' at p. 376. The tree remains, its roots once nourished by the bones of Nicholas de Farndon (junior) and the rest, and its huge leaves still whispering their requiems."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|Alfred Smee||10/06/1841||18 June 1818 \u2013 11 January 1877 Surgeon"]}, {"page": "Murders at Stanfield Hall", "response": ["Rush's plan called for Sandford to provide an alibi by stating that he was at the farm during the hour or so that the crime was committed.
