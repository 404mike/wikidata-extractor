As a tennis player he participated in two Wimbledon Championships and also played first-class cricket.\nWhile studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1870, Myers played a first-class cricket match for Cambridge University against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He batted in the middle order and scored seven in the first innings, then six in the second. He was a Cambridge Apostle.\nIn 1878 he competed in his first Wimbledon and made it into the quarter-finals, before being defeated in straight sets by eventual champion Frank Hadow. The following year he won his first two matches and was eliminated in the third round, by Irishman C. D. Barry.Myers suffered from epilepsy and is believed to have taken his own life in 1894.  John Hughlings Jackson published a study of his case.He was the brother of scholar Frederic William Henry Myers and poet Ernest Myers.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederic W. H.

At the inquest Arthur Thomas Myers, the brother of F.W.H. Myers, testified to having prescribed chloroform for neuralgia,Oppenheim (1985) p.144 and a verdict of accidental death was recorded.  It was widely thought at the time that Gurney might have committed suicide, and Alice James recorded this in her diary.  Trevor Hall in his study The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney has argued the case that Gurney's death was suicide, resulting from disillusionment after discovering the frauds of Blackburn and Smith.  Gordon Epperson argues against this hypothesis and Janet Oppenheim concludes that \"the mystery is not likely to be resolved\".Oppenheim (1985) p.145"]}, {"page": "Frederic Myers", "response": ["He married Fanny Lucas in 1839 and after her death in 1840 he married Susan Harriet Marshall (1811\u20131896), daughter of the wealthy industrialist John Marshall (1765\u20131845).
