Timothy Priestley, brother of Joseph Priestley, 14 August 1785, as the minister of a congregational church in Cannon Street. He was not very successful in his ministry, which was disturbed by controversy, especially with some Scottish members, who were anxious to import the fashion of 'ruling elders,' and who eventually seceded and erected in Mosley Street what was then the largest dissenting chapel in Lancashire (according to Robert Halley). He resigned his position in 1794 and left the neighbourhood. He is buried in Bunhill Fields, where his gravestone states that he 'died 13 Jan. 1803, aged 67 years; having been a preacher of the gospel forty-two years.'"]}, {"page": "List of places of worship in London, 1804", "response": ["|Timothy Priestley"]}, {"page": "Old Jewry Meeting-house", "response": ["In 1808 the meeting-house was rebuilt in Jewin Street, on a site almost opposite the one it had occupied between 1692 and 1701, for Abraham Rees as minister.
