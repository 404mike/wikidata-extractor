He had a successful trial with Stockport County, but the move fell through when he failed the medical. He was then introduced to agent Willie McKay who persuaded Agathe to try finding a club in Scotland. McKay took him to Kirkcaldy, where local club Raith Rovers were looking for a striker having lost their first four games of the season. Although he had never played a competitive game as a forward, Agathe told Raith Rovers manager John McVeigh that he had, and he scored twice in a bounce game against the first team. He then played days later against Airdrie as a trialist, and scored a hat-trick. He went on to play over 30 games for Raith that season, scoring seven times."]}, {"page": "Brisbane City FC", "response": ["* John McVeigh"]}, {"page": "A Shot at Glory", "response": ["Filming took place at several locations across Scotland, including Boghead Park (the former ground of Dumbarton), Dumfries club Queen of the South's Palmerston Park ground, Kilmarnock's Rugby Park ground and Hampden Park. The majority of scenes representing the town of Kilnockie were filmed in Crail, Fife. Several extras in the film were then players of Raith Rovers, including future Celtic player Didier Agathe. Duvall regularly went to see Raith Rovers to learn from John McVeigh, the manager, on whom his character was based. The movie is loosely based on the cup exploits of Airdrieonians who as a small town team reached two Scottish Cup Finals, several League Cup semi finals and qualified for the European Cup Winners Cup in the 1990s. John McVeigh was Assistant Manager at Airdrie when they enjoyed this success. The cast featured several past and current Airdrie players in both speaking and non speaking roles. Robert Duvall was impressed with Ally McCoist acting."]}]}}
