He is best known as the writer and director of autobiographical films like Distant Voices, Still Lives (1988), The Long Day Closes (1992) and collage film Of Time and the City (2008), as well as literature adaptions like The House of Mirth (2000).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cinema of the United Kingdom", "response": ["With the involvement of Channel 4 in film production, talents from television moved into feature films with Stephen Frears (My Beautiful Laundrette) and Mike Newell with Dance with a Stranger (1985). John Boorman, who had been working in the US, was encouraged back to the UK to make Hope and Glory (1987). Channel Four also became a major sponsor of the British Film Institute's Production Board, which backed three of Britain's most critically acclaimed filmmakers: Derek Jarman (The Last of England, 1987), Terence Davies (Distant Voices, Still Lives, 1988), and Peter Greenaway; the latter of whom gained surprising commercial success with The Draughtsman's Contract (1982) and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989). Stephen Woolley's company Palace Pictures also produced some successful films, including Neil Jordan's The Company of Wolves (1984) and Mona Lisa (1986), before collapsing amid a series of unsuccessful films. Amongst the other British films of the decade were Bill Forsyth's Gregory's Girl (1981) and Local Hero (1983), Lewis Gilbert's Educating Rita (1983), Peter Yates' The Dresser (1983) and Kenneth Branagh's directorial debut, Henry V (1989).", "Although it had been funding British experimental films as early as 1952, the British Film Institute's foundation of a production board in 1964\u2014and a substantial increase in public funding from 1971 onwards\u2014enabled it to become a dominant force in developing British art cinema in the 1970s and 80s: from the first of Bill Douglas's Trilogy My Childhood (1972), and of Terence Davies' Trilogy Childhood (1978), via Peter Greenaway's earliest films (including the surprising commercial success of The Draughtsman's Contract (1982)) and Derek Jarman's championing of the New Queer Cinema. The first full-length feature produced under the BFI's new scheme was Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's Winstanley (1975), while others included Moon Over the Alley (1975), Requiem for a Village (1975), the openly avant-garde Central Bazaar (1973), Pressure (1975) and A Private Enterprise (1974) \u2013 the last two being, respectively, the first British Black and Asian features."]}, {"page": "November 10", "response": ["*1945 \u2013 Terence Davies, English actor, director, and screenwriter "]}, {"page": "Gillian Anderson", "response": ["Gillian Leigh Anderson, (; )  (born August 9, 1968 ) is an American actress.
