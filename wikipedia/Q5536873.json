He took pupils in to teach them architectural drawing. These pupils included William Eden Nesfield and the future American architect John Hubbard Sturgis.Joan Marter The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art Vol. 1, 602 It is as a pioneer of chromolithographic printing that Colling must be particularly remembered. The technique of chromolithography, or using lithography for colour printing, had spread to Britain from Europe in the mid-1840s. This provided Colling an opportunity to illustrate the painted Medieval screens or encaustic floor tiles that he had recorded in East Anglian churches. His first volume of Gothic Ornaments: Being a Series of Examples of Enriched Details and Accessories of the Architecture of Great Britain appeared in 1838 and was an early venture of the publisher George Bell. Like Ruskin, he despised whitewash, proclaiming in Chapter II of his second volume: \"That love of white wash, to which the Church Wardens of the last century were so pertinaciously addicted, was a puritanical notion, which was, probably, handed down to them from the time of the Reformation; and the sooner it is altogether got rid of along with the white ceilings of our dwelling houses, the better\". He then went on until 1865 publishing a series of books on Medieval detailing and decoration using many coloured prints. In the introduction to the first volume of Gothic Ornament, Colling mentions the support he has been given by Ewan Christian and it is likely that Christian used Colling's design for the Commissioners' churches. Later, when Christian in 1895 designed the west front of the National Portrait Gallery, Colling provided drawings for the detailing. In later life Colling devoted more time to producing watercolours of London buildings and street scenes."]}, {"page": "Charles Whittingham (1795\u20131876)", "response": ["In 1854 Whittingham lost his wife and his friend Pickering, and in 1860 took his manager John Wilkins (died 1869), into partnership, and retired from active work.

Kichereno is not a place name, but a tribe name, the name of a kind of people.In 1846, scholar Horatio Hale used the term Kizh in a United States government report on \u201cEthnography and Philology.\u201d Lieutenant Amiel Weeks Whipple, Thomas Ewbank, and William Turner used Kizh when publishing a \u201cReport upon the Indian Tribes\u201d in 1855 for the U.S. War Department.
