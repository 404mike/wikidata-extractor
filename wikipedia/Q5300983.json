After years of getting nowhere with his musical career, his planned self-released debut single, \"The Mystery\", was played by BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles after Walker turned up outside the Radio 1 studio on 28 August 2007 at 5.30 am. He gave a copy of the recording to Moyles as he arrived for work.  It was played at 7.20 am, and the radio station was inundated with emails and SMS texts, resulting in Moyles playing the song seven more times that week.

Records on 12 October 2007.Walker's debut album was produced by Danton Supple who was responsible for X&Y by Coldplay and Silence Is Easy by Starsailor.
