In the game against Scotland, Brook was part of an England forward line which included Sammy Crooks, Bobby Barclay, George Camsell and Cliff Bastin. The result was a 1\u20131 draw, which meant that Scotland won the championship that season. In the same year, Brook scored in the 6\u20132 demolition of Hungary. Brook replaced Stoke City's Joe Johnson in the team when he withdrew from the squad due to an injury. One Scottish journalist stated that the 'Hungarians played the prettiest football' and that the score-line was a 'crying injustice'. Another journalist stated that England's wingers, Sammy Crooks and Brook, contributed powerfully to the victory, that Brook constantly did the right thing and that his goal was a gem. A different journalist stated that 'on the extreme left Brook was the opportunist that he always is, and, like Drake, ever a potential matchwinner'. A journalist for the Nottingham Journal stated that Brook and Carter were the best forwards in the second half and that 'they had some splendid passing bouts'. Ted Drake scored a hat-trick in the game and Cliff Britton and Raich Carter scored England's other goals. Drake's second goal was scored from a corner taken by Brook."]}, {"page": "Dartmouth A.F.C.", "response": ["One of their most famous former players is Ralph Birkett, who left Dartmouth to play for Torquay United and went on to play for the England national football team."]}, {"page": "Billy Bell (footballer)", "response": ["In 1925 he joined Leicester City, playing 41 times (5 goals) over the next five years before joining Torquay United in 1930.

The match marked the debut of a 17-year-old winger from Dartmouth named Ralph Birkett.

Ironically, the match also saw the final appearance of another local hero Sid Cann.

Born in Babbacombe, Sid Cann had joined the Magpies the previous season at the age of 16 and quickly developed into an extremely effective full back, eventually displacing the more experienced Willie Brown from the team.  In his second season, he had proved his versatility by being able to fill in at centre half, a role he fulfilled in this game.  Unfortunately, this was to be Cann's last match for the Magpies before leaving for Manchester City.  Ironically, the same game saw the debut of another local lad with Ralph Birkett, a 17-year-old amateur from Dartmouth United, appearing on the right wing.  Birkett had a storming debut for Torquay setting up four of United's goals and the youngster signed a professional contract with the club shortly afterwards.  While Cann's move to a First Division side was a major accomplishment for a Torquay player, Birkett would go on to eclipse his achievements when, after three full seasons for United, he would sign for Arsenal and then Middlesbrough before eventually appearing for England in 1935.", "|align=\"left\"|Ralph Birkett", "|Ralph Birkett"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["However, despite their blistering start to the season, Torquay then hit upon a run of bad form towards the end of the year in which they lost six out of seven games and saw them drop to 12th position by Christmas Day.
