She also appeared in several films and TV productions.\nA devotee of Bernard Shaw, she was president of the Shaw Society from 1949. In their obituary, the Independent wrote \"Pollock is believed to have played, in a career spanning 72 years, more Shavian heroines than anyone else. She directed London seasons of his plays; and it was during the London premiere of one of his lesser-known works \u2013 Farfetched Fables (Watergate, 1950) \u2013 that she announced Shaw's death from the stage.\"Pollock's dedication to acting began as a seven-year-old, when she saw Sarah Bernhardt on stage; she knew then that she wanted to be an actress herself. Pollock was also a theatre director and a teacher of drama at RADA and Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art; and her varied television work included several appearances in The Forsyte Saga for the BBC.She outlived both husbands, Captain Leslie Hancock and the artist James Proudfoot. She had one child with Captain Hancock. Pollock was the subject of TV's This Is Your Life in 1992.Ellen Pollock's mother, Hedwig Kahn, was the sister of Otto Hermann Kahn (wealthy investment banker, collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts) and composer Robert Kahn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1902", "response": ["* June 29 \u2013 Ellen Pollock, British actress (d. 1997)"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 29 || Ellen Pollock || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 94 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actress || "]}, {"page": "The Provoked Wife", "response": ["One of the first radio adaptations was broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 15 June 1948.http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/5e472ce7ee774f7da4bcdbc64c198fed The production was adapted by Ronald Simpson, and the cast included Norman Shelley as Sir John Brute, Lydia Sherwood as Lady Brute, Ellen Pollock as Lady Fanciful."]}, {"page": "Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width", "response": ["Notable guest artistes included film actors Dennis Price as a Savile Row tailor and Rupert Davies as a Roman Catholic bishop, Fred Emney, Harold Bennett, David Kossoff (playing himself), Jack Smethurst, Dad's Army stars Frank Williams (playing another clergyman) and Bill Pertwee, comedian Dick Bentley, Roy Marsden, Victor Maddern, future Coronation Street stars Barbara Knox (as Barbara Mullaney) and Roy Barraclough, George A.
