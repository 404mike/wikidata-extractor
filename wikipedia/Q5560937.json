Born in Derby, he began his career at Ashford United. In January 1900, he became Newton Heath's first signing for which they paid a fee, joining the club for \u00a340 on the recommendation of forward Bob Donaldson. Half of the fee was paid on signing, with the remainder due if Godsmark were kept on after an initial trial period. He made his debut on 3 February 1900, playing at inside right in a 1\u20130 home win over Sheffield Wednesday; his performance was well received, with the Athletic News reporting that \"Godsmark proved a great success, he has any amount of dash and ability\". However, his stay at Newton Heath was curtailed three months later by a call-up to be a reservist with the British Army in the Second Boer War, after just nine league appearances and four goals. After just nine months in South Africa, Godsmark died from an unknown disease. Because his death meant he was unable to return to Newton Heath after the war, despite them retaining his registration after he was enlisted, they withheld the remaining \u00a320 of his fee, for which Ashford served them with a writ.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ashford United F.C.", "response": ["In early 1900 two Ashford players, Gilbert Godsmark and George Foley were transferred to Second Division club Newton Heath. The former of these players is notable as the first signed for a transfer fee by the club that was shortly to become Manchester United. The fee of \u00a340 was payable in two instalments with half paid immediately and the remainder after satisfactory completion of a trial period. However, after scoring four goals in nine matches sadly, early the following year, Godsmark died of disease on army service at the Second Boer War \u2013 with Ashford reportedly serving a writ for the remaining \u00a320."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["The first transfer for which Manchester United (then Newton Heath) had to pay a fee was the transfer of Gilbert Godsmark from Ashford in January 1900, paying \u00a340 for the forward. The club's first \u00a31,000 transfer came in 1910, when they signed Leslie Hofton from Glossop. When the club signed Tommy Taylor from Barnsley in 1953, the fee was intended to be \u00a330,000. However, Matt Busby did not want to burden the young player with the \"\u00a330,000-man\" tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by \u00a31 to \u00a329,999.
