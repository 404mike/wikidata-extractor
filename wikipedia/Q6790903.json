Unable to secure the support of the English bishops, Luscombe was consecrated a missionary bishop (i.e. without a See) by the Scottish bishops in 1825, and functioned as a sort of proto-Bishop of Fulham."]}, {"page": "Luscombe", "response": ["*Matthew Luscombe (1776\u20131846), English missionary bishop of the Anglican Communion"]}, {"page": "William Palmer (theologian and ecumenist)", "response": ["Bent on renewing his application for admission to communion in the Greek church, Palmer early in 1842 visited Paris, and laid the whole case before Bishop Matthew Luscombe, in whose chapel the Princess Galitzin, then resident in Paris, was in the habit of communicating.
