This was followed by a fracas at the Portadown F.C. Social Club on 27 December 1999 where LVF members were commemorating the second anniversary of Billy Wright's fatal shooting inside the Maze Prison by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). When Jameson entered the club several LVF men began to push and jostle him and challenged him to a fight; telling Jameson to hit them instead of women. Deeply offended, Jameson left and soon returned with a UVF gang armed with pickaxe handles and baseball bats. In the violent brawl that ensued, 12 people, including three LVF prisoners out on Christmas parole, received severe injuries. The LVF leaders subsequently made the decision that Jameson would pay for the attack with his life."]}, {"page": "Muriel Gibson (loyalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Muriel Gibson"]}]}}
