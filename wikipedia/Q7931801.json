The show notably casts the first transgender actor in a transgender role in a UK television series, with comedian Bethany Black portraying Helen, a transgender woman. Davies insisted that a transgender actor be cast as Helen, going so far as to alter the script until Black was cast at the eleventh hour; Black was vocal in her praise for this, contrasting the decision with the casting of Jared Leto as a trans woman in the recent film Dallas Buyers Club, which she described as \"a cisgender guy trying to play what he thought a trans woman would be like\", and compared cisgender actors playing transgender roles to blackface portrayals in shows such as It Ain't Half Hot Mum.

He also says that he wants to push people to think about what happened on the night of Vicky's murder by publishing more photos of her in the media. He also expresses concerns that someone on the investigation team may have committed the murder, with a particular concern about John because he had Vicky's phone number stored on his phone and because of his marital breakdown. Following a news broadcast about Vicky, Neil Ackroyd (Con O'Neill) tells Catherine about how Vicky blackmailed him and eventually ruined his life. Catherine passes on Neil's details to a distant John. After an investigation meeting, John tries to make his escape. Graham Tattersall (Steve Edge) arrives at the police station, believing that he has some useful information with regards to the Vicky Fleming case. He is interviewed by Catherine, and he explains that he was having an affair with a married woman when her husband returned from work on the night of Vicky's murder. Baffled, Catherine asks for the name of her husband, and he reveals it to be John. Catherine goes to report this information to Andy, but sees John in the corridor, who sees Graham behind her.
