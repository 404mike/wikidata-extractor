Stone Collins. The first substantial commission they applied for was for offices for the London County Council. Despite many very well known names entering, Knott won at the age of 29. Designs for the construction were brought to life by the architect and perspectivist Alick Horsnell. His design was altered significantly before construction began, including the familiar semicircular terrace being moved from the land to the river-side of the building. Construction was held up by the First World War, during which Knott worked on designs for Royal Air Force bases, and partially completed in 1922 (except for the northern third). In June 1921 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects."]}, {"page": "Horsnell", "response": ["*Alick Horsnell (1882\u20131916), English architect, draughtsman, and artist "]}, {"page": "Alick", "response": ["*Alick Horsnell (1881\u20131916), English architect"]}]}}
