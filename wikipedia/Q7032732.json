This angered the Church of England. In 1912, D. J. Scannell O'Neill wrote in The Fortnightly Review that London \"seems to have more than her due share of bishops\" and enumerates what he refers to as \"these hireling shepherds\". He also announces that one of them, Mathew, revived the OCR and published The Torch, a monthly review, advocating the reconstruction of Western Christianity and reunion with Eastern Christianity. The Torch stated \"that the ordinations of the Church of England are not recognized by any church claiming to be Catholic\" so the promoters involved Mathew to conditionally ordain group members who are \"clergy of the Established Church\" and \"sign a profession of the Catholic Faith\". It stipulated Mathew's services were not a system of simony and given without simoniac expectations. The group sought to enroll \"earnest-minded Catholics who sincerely desire to help forward the work of [c]orporate [r]eunion with the Holy See\". Nigel Yates, in Anglican Ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910, described it as \"an even more bizarre scheme to promote a Catholic Uniate Church in Britain\" than Lee and Ambrose Lisle March Phillipps de Lisle's Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom."]}, {"page": "University of Wales, Lampeter", "response": ["*Professor Emeritus Nigel Yates (Theology)"]}, {"page": "Richard Wendene", "response": ["At Sandford's death, in spring 1235, the monks of Rochester elected Wendene bishop.
