Massie considers him to be one of the five favourites, including the lovers she had as Grand Duchess, whom she loved.Massie, p. 323. Massie expands that \"his devotion to Catherine was based on her role as his teacher as much as her position as empress.\" Catriona Kelly has described Catherine as \"nudging her lover...into cultivated pursuits.\" As with most of her favorites, Lanskoy was beneficiary of her \"strongly pedagogical streak in seeking to cultivate promising young noblemen of mediocre background,\" which Lanskoy responded wholeheartedly to.\" Sebag Montefiore called him \"Catherine's ideal pupil and companion [even though he] was not highly educated but [was] keen to learn.\" However, Marie Daniel Bourr\u00e9e, Baron de Corberon, the French charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Russia, wrote in September 1780, \"\u2018[h]e has just been bought [by Catherine] a library for 10,000 roubles, which he certainly will not read.\u2019\"Dixon, p. 265"]}, {"page": "Pavlik Morozov", "response": ["In her 2005 book Comrade Pavlik: The Rise and Fall of a Soviet Boy Hero, Catriona Kelly agrees with Druzhnikov that the official version of the account is almost wholly fictional, that the evidence is sketchy, based mostly on second-hand reports by alleged witnesses, and that Pavlik did not inform on his parents but was murdered after a mundane squabble. Kelly also shows how the official version's emphasis shifted to suit the changing times and propaganda lines. In some accounts, Pavlik's father's crime was not forging the documents, but hoarding grain; in others, he was denounced not to the secret police, but to the schoolteacher. In some accounts, the method of Pavlik's death was decapitation by saw. The one surviving photograph of him shows a malnourished child, who bears almost no resemblance to the statues and images in children's books. It has also been said that he was nearly illiterate and was coerced to inform on his father by his mother, after Pavlik's father deserted the family. Kelly, who had access to the official archives of the case, states that Druzhnikov's theory that Pavlik was killed by the GPU is unlikely.
