The album received critical acclaim, combining the \"new\" Overkill with their raw early style as presented on the debut album Feel the Fire. Touring for the album included a number of European festivals during the summer, and a full European tour followed in November with Seven Witches and After All.

In an interview with Metal Exhumator in October 2019, Ellsworth said, \"We just sat down and talked about starting to write in the spring. Maybe late spring, early summer, just say maybe we should just schedule some time to do it. But there's been no ideas with regard to where it's going to go.\" Bittner revealed in an April 2020 interview with Metal Pilgrim that Verni had written nine songs for their new album, but added that plans to enter the studio were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic: \"So our plan was to start working on new material, but considering the fact that we have to stay in our spaces right now, we're just kind of doing things electronically and it's just given D.D. some more time to write.

The problem is that we really can't do our regular pre-production right now, because we all don't live in the same state.\" On September 5, 2020, Bitter announced on his Facebook profile that Overkill would enter the studio on September 14 to begin recording their new album. Drum tracks had been finished by October, and mixing was handled by Colin Richardson, who had previously worked with Overkill in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In an interview on That Metal Interview in October 2020, Bittner said its release could be pushed back to the fall of 2021 due to the COVID pandemic, explaining, \"Lord knows what's gonna happen. God forbid it gets worse. It might even be pushed back even longer. But the point is at least we're gonna get it done.\" Verni reiterated Bittner's comments about a possible release date, saying, \"I don't know. We're trying to coordinate it maybe with some touring. We don't really have any touring till next July, I think, our first shows. We have shows [booked] in July, August, September, October. Whether any of them are gonna happen, I don't know, but probably something like that for the new Overkill release. So I'll be working on that between now and then.\" Bittner later stated that the release of the new album was pushed back to February 2022. In an August 2021 interview on Trunk Nation With Eddie Trunk, Verni revealed that Overkill was still recording their new album and planning to mix it in the fall for a March 2022 release coincided with a tour.
