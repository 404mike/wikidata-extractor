Chao was a favorite candidate, while Denise Crosby was described as \"the only possibility\" for the character of Deanna Troi. The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors, and so the team took account of the casting of the two roles together.Nemecek (2003): p. 18 The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type, and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts. After Crosby and Marina Sirtis had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively, Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar. He felt that Sirtis' appearance was better suited to the \"exotic\" Troi."]}, {"page": "1987 in film", "response": ["* Dolls, directed by Stuart Gordon, starring Stephen Lee, Guy Rolfe, Hilary Mason, and Bunty Bailey"]}, {"page": "Hot Gossip", "response": ["*Bunty Bailey"]}, {"page": "Wraysbury", "response": ["* Bunty Bailey \u2013 the girl in the rotoscoped music video \"Take On Me\" by A-ha; also the video for another a-ha song, \"The Sun Always Shines On T.V.\", and also a past member of Hot Gossip"]}, {"page": "The Big Fat Quiz of the Year", "response": ["In-studio guest questions were provided by Kriss Akabusi and Samantha Fox, who presented the final bonus question.
