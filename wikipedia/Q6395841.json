He then moved to Mansfield Town, on the recommendation of Mansfield assistant manager Frank Marshall who had previously been on Doncaster's coaching staff. Bird initially joined Mansfield on a trial basis, and played well enough to earn himself a contract, and became a mainstay in the Stags' central defence for the next eleven seasons. He made his Mansfield debut in a Division Four match against Chester City on 21 October 1972.In his eleven seasons at Field Mill, Bird played 450 first-team games, placing him fourth on Mansfield's all-time appearance list, and scored 63 goals. He was a member of the Mansfield teams that won the Division Four title in 1974-75, and the Division Three title two years later.\nHis final match in the Mansfield shirt came in the 3\u20132 defeat against Peterborough United on 7 May 1983. Bird scored one of Mansfield's goals in that game. Two days later, he got his testimonial against Aston Villa on Field Mill in front of a 2,903 crowd.In the summer of 1983, Bird signed for Huddersfield Town. However, he only played once for Huddersfield, and retired from professional football at the end of the season, and moved back to the Mansfield area, where he played for several local non-league teams before hanging up his boots for good. He now lives in Mansfield Woodhouse and is retired. He suffers from dementia which they believe is a custom to heading of footballs for so many years.\nIn May 2009 it was announced that the executive suite at Mansfield Town would be renamed after Kevin and from 27 May 2009 it will be known as 'The Kevin Bird Suite'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983\u201384 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Kevin Bird||||DF||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Kevin Bird||||1983||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "List of Mansfield Town F.C. players", "response": ["Goalkeeper Rod Arnold owns the club record for most games played for Mansfield Town.
