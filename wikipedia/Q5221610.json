Educated at Oxford and at Harvard, she held a personal Chair in \"Post-Christian Thought\" at the University of St Andrews. Hampson's distinctive theological position has both gained her notoriety and been widely influential. Holding that Christianity is neither true nor moral (in not being gender inclusive), she believes the overcoming of patriarchal religion to be fundamental to human emancipation. As a theologian Hampson has always held to a \"realist\" position, in which the understanding of \"that which is God\" is based in human religious experience.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of St Andrews", "response": ["*Daphne Hampson"]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1940\u20131999||data-sort-value=\"Hampson, Daphne\"|Daphne Hampson||United Kingdom||1944||\u2013||||"]}, {"page": "History of rape", "response": ["Medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas argued that rape, though sinful, was less sinful than masturbation or coitus interruptus, because it fulfilled the procreative function of sex, while the other acts violated the purpose of sex.Alan Soble, Sexual Investigations, NYU Press, 1998, p.10-11.Vern L.

She stressed that all models are partial, and are thought-experiments with shortcomings: many are needed, and need to function together.Article The World as God\u2019s Body at website of The Christian Century magazine  Her work on God as mother, for example, stressed that God is beyond male and female, recognizing twin dangers: exaggeration of the maternal qualities of the mother so as to unhelpfully essentialize God (and by transference, women as well) as caring and self-sacrificing; or juxtaposition of this image to that of father, unhelpfully emphasizing the gender-based nature of both male and female images for God. Nonetheless, she saw in it other connotations, which she maintained are helpful in re-imaging God in terms of the mother metaphor.", "McFague's panentheistic theology stressed God as highly involved in the world (though distinct from it), and concerned (as seen in the life of the paradigmatic Jesus, for example) to see all of it brought to full enjoyment of the richness of life as originally intended in creation.  This is not the omnipotent, omniscient and immutable God of classical theism and neo-orthodoxy: for McFague, God is not transcendent in any sense that we can know.  This has led some critics to ask whether McFague's theology leaves us with anything that may properly be called God at all.
