He played the parts of Mortimer the Elder and Matrevis in a production of Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, which also featured his son, the actor Samuel Collings. He also appeared as the King of France in Henry V, and most recently Giles Corey in The Crucible at the same venue."]}, {"page": "Chris New", "response": ["In September 2011, New played the title role in Edward II by Christopher Marlowe at the Royal Exchange Theatre. Alfred Hickling had high praise for New's performance as Edward II, a decidedly non-sympathetic role. \"Chris New's Edward earns pity, if not respect. His incessant vacillation is perfectly illustrated in the childish manner with which he folds his abdication papers into a crown, as if the realm of England were something that fell out of a cracker.\" David Chadderton, writing for The British Theatre Guide, found New equally praiseworthy: \"The production is held together by a superb pairing of Chris New as Edward and Samuel Collings as Gaveston and later as the sinister murderer Lightborn. There is never any doubt about the sexual nature of their relationship and the bond feels genuine, and, while neither character is particularly attractive, they both have great charisma.\""]}, {"page": "The Bible (miniseries)", "response": ["* Samuel Collings \u2013 Zedekiah"]}, {"page": "Collings (surname)", "response": ["* Samuel Collings, British artist of 18th century", "* Samuel Collings (actor), British actor"]}, {"page": "Samuel Collings", "response": ["thumb|Self-portrait by Samuel Collings, circa 1789", "Samuel Collings (fl. 1780\u20131790?) was a British painter and caricaturist of 18th century.", "William Blake Samuel Collings, May-Day in London, 1784.jpg|May-Day in London", "William Blake Samuel Collings, The Discomfited Duellists, 1784.jpg|The Discomfited Duellists"]}, {"page": "List of dramatic television series with LGBT characters: 1960s\u20132000s", "response": ["| Tom Wright || Samuel Collings || Tom is secretly gay and in love with Leon."]}, {"page": "The Lost Pirate Kingdom", "response": ["*Samuel Collings as Paulsgrave Williams"]}, {"page": "List of horror television series with LGBT characters", "response": ["| Tom Wright || Samuel Collings || Tom is secretly gay and in love with Leon."]}]}}
