After training at the Westminster Hotel School, she worked as nanny for a rich family in Paris, where she gained a diploma from the Cordon Bleu school, and then spent two years working in the test kitchens of the Nestl\u00e9 company in White Plains, New York. There she learned how to record recipes accurately and how to prepare food to be photographed.\nOn return to England in 1959 she joined the magazine company Fleetway Publications as a junior cookery writer, and in 1966 became cookery editor on the Woman's Journal, a post she held for 32 years. In 1966 she also began to contribute to The Times, where until 1978 she had a column every Saturday and a whole page of recipes once a month. In 1972 she published The Times Cookery Book, a classic of which her obituary in The Telegraph said:\n\n\"Unlike some recipe books from the early 1970s, Katie Stewart's book remains timelessly useful. Alongside the glossily pristine productions of Gordon Ramsay, Sophie Dahl, Ottolenghi et al, The Times Cookery Book is almost always recognizable from its broken spine and pages dog-eared and stained with the oil and gravy of many years' service. Clean replacements are hard to find.\"\nShe published a number of other books, including The Pooh Cook Book (1971) and The Sociable Cook (2001), and in the early 1970s made three series of Cooking with Katie programmes for Grampian Television.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grampian Television", "response": ["With encouragement from the IBA, Grampian and other small ITV companies were encouraged to produce more network output following the 1980 franchise round.

Amongst her recruitments to the paper were Katie Stewart and Suzy Menkes. She left The Times in 1969, after nearly four years at the paper, and became involved with the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham. In 1970, she was published in Richard Boston's journalism critique The Press We Deserve."]}]}}
