Eastleigh had a fine run of form under Todd and rose to third place in the league table by Christmas. Meanwhile, the club was gaining national coverage for its FA Cup exploits. Eastleigh travelled to Crewe in the 1st round and achieved their first ever giant killing, courtesy of a 1\u20130 win with a Ben Strevens penalty. In the second round, Eastleigh won 2\u20130 at minnows Stourbridge to record their first ever appearance in the Third round. On 9 January, Eastleigh drew 1\u20131 with Bolton.
