Herodotus 1.16, 1.25, 1.86 gave reign lengths for Gyges' successors, but there is uncertainty about these as the total exceeds the timespan between 652 (probable death of Gyges, fighting the Cimmerians) and 547/546 (fall of Sardis to Cyrus the Great). Bury and Meiggs concluded that Ardys and Sadyattes reigned through an unspecified period in the second half of the 7th century BC, but they did not propose dates for Alyattes except their assertion that his son Croesus succeeded him in 560 BC. The timespan 560\u2013546 BC for the reign of Croesus is almost certainly accurate."]}, {"page": "Alcibiades", "response": ["Even today, Alcibiades divides scholars. For Malcolm F. McGregor, former head of the Department of Classics in the University of British Columbia, Alcibiades was rather a shrewd gambler than a mere opportunist.M.F. McGregor, The Genius of Alkibiades, 27\u201350. Evangelos P. Fotiadis, a prominent Greek philologist, asserts that Alcibiades was \"a first class diplomat\" and had \"huge skills\". Nevertheless, his spiritual powers were not counterbalanced with his magnificent mind and he had the hard luck to lead a people susceptible to demagoguery. K. Paparrigopoulos, a major modern Greek historian, underlines his \"spiritual virtues\" and compares him with Themistocles, but he then asserts that all these gifts created a \"traitor, an audacious and impious man\".\u039a. Paparrigopoulos, History of the Greek Nation, \u0391\u03b2, 264\u201368. Walter Ellis believes that his actions were outrageous, but they were performed with panache.W. Ellis, Alcibiades, 18. For his part, David Gribble argues that Alcibiades's actions against his city were misunderstood and believes that \"the tension which led to Alcibiades's split with the city was between purely personal and civic values\".D. Gribble, Alcibiades and Athens, 55 &c. Russell Meiggs, a British ancient historian, asserts that the Athenian statesman was absolutely unscrupulous despite his great charm and brilliant abilities. According to Meiggs his actions were dictated by selfish motives and his feud with Cleon and his successors undermined Athens. The same scholar underscores the fact that \"his example of restless and undisciplined ambition strengthened the charge brought against Socrates\". Even more critically, Athanasios G. Platias and Constantinos Koliopoulos, professors of strategic studies and international politics, state that Alcibiades's own arguments \"should be sufficient to do away with the notion that Alcibiades was a great statesman, as some people still believe\".A.G. Platias and C. Koliopoulos, Thucydides on Strategy, 240. Writing from a different perspective, psychologist Anna C. Salter cites Alcibiades as exhibiting \"all the classic features of psychopathy.\"Anna C. Salter, Predators: Pedophiles, Rapists, And Other Sex Offenders, Basic Books, 2005, p. 128.

J. B. Bury and Russell Meiggs (1975) say that Candaules is a Maeonian name meaning \"hound-choker\". More recently, however, it has been suggested that the name or title Kandaules is cognate with the Luwian hantawatt(i)\u2013 (\"king\") and probably has Carian origin.Szemer\u00e9nyi, Oswald, \u201cEtyma Latina II (7-18)\u201d, Studi Linguistici in onore di Vittore Pisani.
