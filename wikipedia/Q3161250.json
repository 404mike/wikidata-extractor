Along with his partner James Wilson, he founded a very successful \"hydropathy\" (as it was then called) clinic in Malvern, Worcestershire, which had many notable Victorians, including such figures as Charles Darwin and Alfred, Lord Tennyson, as clients.\nGully's clinic using Malvern water in  Great Malvern, and those that followed, were largely  responsible for Malvern's rapid development  from a village to  a large town. He is also remembered as a suspect in the Charles Bravo poisoning case.", "link_mentions": {}}}
