Along with his partner James Wilson, he founded a very successful \"hydropathy\" (as it was then called) clinic in Malvern, Worcestershire, which had many notable Victorians, including such figures as Charles Darwin and Alfred, Lord Tennyson, as clients.\nGully's clinic using Malvern water in  Great Malvern, and those that followed, were largely  responsible for Malvern's rapid development  from a village to  a large town.

After reading a pamphlet by Doctor James Wilson, who operated a hydropathic establishment with James Manby Gully at Malvern, he stayed there for \"some nine or ten weeks\", after which he \"continued the system some seven weeks longer under Doctor Weiss, at Petersham\", then again at \"Doctor Schmidt's magnificent hydropathic establishment at Boppart\" (at the former Marienberg Convent at Boppard), after developing a cold and fever upon his return home."]}, {"page": "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd", "response": ["In March 1924 Christie also received an unsolicited letter from Lord Mountbatten.

By 1855 there were already 95\u00a0hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town's 800\u00a0houses were hospitality venues.

By the middle of the 19th century, with the arrival of the railway, bath houses and other establishments catering for the health tourists flourished.
