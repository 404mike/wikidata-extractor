Historically, it was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s, when it helped to coin the term \"cartoon\" in its modern sense as a humorous illustration. ", "Punch was founded on 17 July 1841 by Henry Mayhew and wood-engraver Ebenezer Landells, on an initial investment of \u00a325. It was jointly edited by Mayhew and Mark Lemon. It was subtitled The London Charivari in homage to Charles Philipon's French satirical humour magazine Le Charivari. Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove puppet, Mr. Punch, of Punch and Judy; the name also referred to a joke made early on about one of the magazine's first editors, Lemon, that \"punch is nothing without lemon\". Mayhew ceased to be joint editor in 1842 and became \"suggestor in chief\" until he severed his connection in 1845. The magazine initially struggled for readers, except for an 1842 \"Almanack\" issue which shocked its creators by selling 90,000 copies.  In December 1842 due to financial difficulties, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans, both printers and publishers. Bradbury and Evans capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies and also were the publishers for Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray."]}, {"page": "Kate Greenaway", "response": ["Kate Greenaway was born in Hoxton, London, the second of four children, to a working-class family. Her mother, Elizabeth, was a dress maker and her father, John, an engraver who gave up steady employment with Ebenezer Landells' engraving firm to strike out on his own. When Greenaway was very young, he accepted a commission to provide the engraved illustrations to a new edition of Charles Dickens's The Pickwick Papers, sending his young family away to relatives in the countryside to give himself solitude while producing the engravings. Kate's earliest memories are of Rolleston, Nottinghamshire, which affected her deeply. It was a place she returned to frequently in her childhood.Devereux, 49-50 Children's literature scholar Humphrey Carpenter explains the period was to Greenway \"crucial ... she felt it to be her real home, a country of the mind that she could always reimagine\". After returning to grimy London streets Rolleston became a place to visit in her mind and constantly embellish.Carpenter, 225"]}, {"page": "Political cartoon", "response": ["The art of the editorial cartoon was further developed with the publication of the British periodical Punch in 1841, founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells (an earlier magazine that published cartoons was Monthly Sheet of Caricatures, printed from 1830 and an important influence on Punch). It was bought by Bradbury and Evans in 1842, who capitalised on newly evolving mass printing technologies to turn the magazine into a preeminent national institution. The term \"cartoon\" to refer to comic drawings was coined by the magazine in 1843; the Houses of Parliament were to be decorated with murals, and \"carttons\" for the mural were displayed for the public; the term \"cartoon\" then meant a finished preliminary sketch on a large piece of cardboard, or  in Italian.  Punch humorously appropriated the term to refer to its political cartoons, and the popularity of the Punch cartoons led to the term's widespread use."]}, {"page": "1841 in literature", "response": ["*July 17 \u2013 Punch magazine, founded in London by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells, is edited by Mayhew and Mark Lemon."]}, {"page": "Myles Birket Foster", "response": ["Foster was born in North Shields, England of a primarily Quaker family, but his family moved south to London in 1830, where his father founded M.
