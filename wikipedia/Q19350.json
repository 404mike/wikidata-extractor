He joined his hometown club Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2006, and went on to become captain of the side in the Premier League. Henry spent seven seasons at Wolves, making 272 appearances in all competitions.\nHe joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 and helped them to victory in the 2014 Championship play-off Final.

The day after, Zamora broke his leg during a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers following a challenge from Karl Henry that drew criticism. Zamora made his return from injury as a substitute in the FA-Cup encounter against Bolton Wanderers on 21 February 2011. He marked his Premier League return, again as a substitute, with a match-deciding goal from the penalty spot against Blackburn Rovers on 5 March 2011."]}, {"page": "Roger Johnson (footballer)", "response": ["Johnson was almost immediately handed the captaincy of Wolves by Mick McCarthy shortly before the start of the new season, relieving former captain Karl Henry of his duties. The season proved problematic for Johnson and his new team though and McCarthy was sacked in February 2012, following which Johnson said the players had let the manager down. After assistant manager Terry Connor was promoted to fill the vacancy, Johnson featured in only two further matches that season. During March 2012 he was disciplined by the club after turning up for training \"unfit to train properly\", widely reported as being due to alcohol; the player apologised for his conduct, and retained the captaincy. Later that same month, he had an on-field dispute with teammate Wayne Hennessey."]}, {"page": "Joey Barton", "response": ["On 26 August 2011, Barton moved to Queens Park Rangers, signing a four-year contract on a free transfer. He was handed the captain's armband by manager Neil Warnock on his debut with the club, which was a 0\u20130 draw with former club Newcastle. On 17 September, he scored his first goal for QPR during a 3\u20130 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Following his goal, Barton was involved in a physical confrontation with Wolves player Karl Henry. Henry and Barton had a previous physical confrontation in August 2010 when Barton was still at Newcastle. Barton accused Henry of \"trying to hurt people\". Henry responded by calling Barton's behaviour \"embarrassing\"."]}, {"page": "The Panel (Irish TV series)", "response": ["| 8 January 2009 || Craig Doyle || Murphy, Delamere, Alan Shortt, Maxwell || Karl Henry and Shane O'Donoghue || Details"]}, {"page": "David Edwards (footballer, born 1986)", "response": ["On 14 January 2008, Edwards signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Wolverhampton Wanderers.

However, injuries kept him from playing a regular role in the remainder of the season.

He was ever-present over nine league matches and also played twice in the Football League Trophy, a cup competition open to teams from the third and fourth tiers of the Football League; a 3\u20131 aggregate win against Oldham Athletic in the Northern Final earned Chesterfield a place in the final itself. On 6 March, he was recalled by Wolves' new manager, Terry Connor, after an injury to Karl Henry left Wolves in need of midfield cover. Davis himself felt that the possibility of playing Premier League football for Wolves far outweighed the prospect of a Wembley final.", "Dean Saunders, appointed in January 2013 as Wolves' fourth manager in twelve months, brought Davis into the starting eleven as a holding midfielder alongside Karl Henry for two matches. Those were his last starts until 16 March, when he returned against Bristol City, only to give the opposition the lead when his backpass went through the legs of goalkeeper Carl Ikeme. Wolves finished as 2\u20131 winners, but Ikeme was unable to play the second half after punching the tactics board in the dressing-room at half-time and breaking his hand. Two weeks later, he \"produced arguably his best display yet in a Wolves shirt\" when involved in all three goals in a 3\u20132 win away to Birmingham City that took his side out of the relegation positions. His season was cut short when he suffered an ankle injury against Bolton Wanderers on 6 April which ruled him out for the rest of the campaign, which ended in the club being relegated to League One."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|37||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Karl Henry"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Karl Henry"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Karl Henry"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Karl Henry"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Karl Henry"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|23||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Karl Henry"]}]}}
