The Birmingham lamps were exported around the world, with the Lucas company later becoming famous for manufacturing components related to the motor industry and aerospace industry. Richard Bissell Prosser(1838\u20131918) writes 58 lives for the Dictionary of National Biography, and supplies much material for the New English Dictionary. Prosser also writes Birmingham Inventors and Inventions, 1881 and is a pioneer of the study of technical history, his published biographies and manuscript records are an incomparable source for present-day researchers. His father Richard Prosser (1804\u20131854), engineer and inventor, was heavily involved with the introduction of the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1852, and his 700-volume library, combined with that of Bennet Woodcroft forms the basis of the Patent Office Library."]}, {"page": "Lucas Industries", "response": ["In the 1850s, Joseph Lucas, a jobless father of six, sold paraffin oil from a barrow cart around the streets of Hockley.

The company started its main growth in 1914 with a contract to supply Morris Motors Limited with electrical equipment. During World War I Lucas made shells and fuses, as well as electrical equipment for military vehicles. Up until the early 1970s, Lucas was the principal supplier to British manufacturers (such as BSA, Norton and Triumph) of magnetos, dynamos, alternators, switches and other electrical components.", "Harry Lucas designed a hub lamp for use in a high bicycle in 1879 and named the oil lamp \"King of the Road\". This name would come to be associated with the manufactured products of Lucas Companies, into the present day. However, Lucas did not use the \"King of the Road\" epithet for every lamp manufactured. They used this name on only their most prestigious and usually highest priced lamps and goods. This naming format would last until the 1920s when the \"King of the Road\" wording was pressed into the outer edge of the small \"lion and torch\" button motifs that frequently decorated the tops of both bicycles and motor-car lamps. The public was encouraged by Lucas to refer to every Lucas lamp as a \"King of the Road\", but strictly speaking, this is quite wrong, as most lamps throughout the 20th century possessed either a name, a number or both.A selection of Joseph Lucas lamps.
