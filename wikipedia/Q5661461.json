S. Eliot's The Cocktail Party, directed by Harold Lang.  This tour, and his meeting Harold Lang, would change his life and career profoundly.", "Back in London and out of work again, Harold Lang asked Amer, along with fellow actor from the India tour, Greville Hallam,  to join him teaching drama students at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. They spent almost a year writing a play together, based on their teaching of the techniques that an actor needs to bring Shakespeare's printed text to life, calling it Macbeth In Camera.  At its first performance, at the Webber Douglas School, they invited representatives of the British Council to see it. In April 1963, the Council, who had liked the play, offered them a tour of South America. They called their company 'Voyage Theatre'.", "On 1 July 1963, the then four members of Voyage Theatre, Harold Lang, Greville Hallam, Ralph Gruskin and Nicholas Amer, arrived in Jamaica.  A packed audience, including Sir Alexander Morley, the British High Commissioner and his wife, saw their performance of Macbeth in Camera. \"No question about its success,\" wrote Norman Rae, theatre critic of The Daily Gleaner,  while The Star ran \"A refreshing and at times an exciting experience\". Performances followed in Trinidad, Dominica, Antigua, Barbados, Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina.  In Buenos Aires, their final venue, they were put into the Teatro Ode\u00f3n, so heavy was the booking to see them. La Prensa's review next day said, \"Very seldom can the word 'brilliant' be more appropriately applied than to this production\". Later that year the four actors won a collective Best Foreign Actor Award at the Argentine Awards Ceremony in Buenos Aires.", "Back home in London, Harold Lang wrote a new piece for Amer, Hallam and himself, Man Speaking, an examination of English poetry.  Amer would do the poems of John Donne, Hallam those of William Blake and Lang would do the poems of John Milton. Meanwhile Voyage Theatre played the City of London Festival and the King's Lynn Literature Festival,  before flying off again to Australia, this time to play Sydney and Melbourne but also, at the Australian Arts Council's request, to tour extensively all over New South Wales and Victoria.  In December 1964, they performed at the Hong Kong Arts Festival then returned to Kathmandu in Nepal (this time at the King's request), India (Bombay), Turkey (Ankara and Istanbul) and Egypt (Cairo), then back to London. In May 1965 they travelled to Switzerland (Basle, Lausanne, Geneva and Vevey) and then back to the UK for performances in Hemel Hempstead and the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre in London. In December of that year they toured to Turkey (Istanbul and Ankara) with Man Speaking and also to Thailand (Bangkok) en route to yet another return visit to New Zealand and Australia.", "Nicholas Amer was the last surviving member of the original four actors who made up Voyage Theatre. Harold Lang had died of a heart attack in Cairo in 1970,  Greville Hallam had \"died tragically, aged 48\" in London in 1982,  and Ralph Gruskin was killed in a street accident in Rome.
