Carden lead the team to a tenth place finish in their first season in the division. In the 2017\u201318 Northern Premier League season Warrington improved on the previous campaign and ended up with a highest ever finish of third in the NPL Premier Division qualifying them for the play-offs, where they lost in a home semi-final against Grantham Town.  They followed this up in 2018-19 with another third placed finish, in a season made more complicated by the expulsion of North Ferriby United who went out of business partway through the campaign. In the play-offs Warrington beat Nantwich Town 4-1 in a home semi-final, and then won 2-1 against South Shields in the final. Normally this would have resulted in promotion to National League North. However, as a one-off for the 2018-19 season, Town had to play a \"super playoff\" game against the playoff winners of the newly-formed Southern League Premier Central Division.  In this game Warrington lost 3-2 to King's Lynn Town after extra time, and they remained in the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2019\u201320 season.
