A midfielder, he made 478 league appearances in a 13-year career in the Football League.\nA qualified teacher, he began his career with Port Vale in 1972. He spent five years at the club, before being sold on to Chesterfield for \u00a315,000 in March 1977. He helped the club to lift the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1981, before he returned to Port Vale for a \u00a315,000 fee in November of that year. He spent four years with the \"Valiants\", helping the club to achieve promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1982\u201383.

Lee made some key signings however, bringing in Stafford Rangers goal-machine Ray Williams for \u00a33,000, midfielder Freddie Goodwin (Southport), 'controversial' goalkeeper Alan Boswell (Bolton Wanderers), young midfielder Colin Tartt, and trialist goalkeeper Reg Edwards (Nuneaton Borough). Six wins were gained from the opening eight league games, though low attendances caused Lee to remark that \"the people here are not genuinely interested in league football\". Offered the management position at Shrewsbury Town, he rejected the offer as he believed the club \"lacked potential\" and that he had a \"feeling of loyalty towards the [Vale] players\". In mid-season he sold John James to Chester for \u00a35,000, Ray Harford to Colchester United for \u00a31,750, and Keith Lindsey to Gillingham for \u00a3750, whilst spending \u00a32,250 to bring 'pacey' striker John Woodward in from Walsall. Lee's team was criticized for foul play, particularly on 10 March, when Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy branded them \"a brutal and physical side\". In the FA Cup, West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood claimed that the Vale players attempted \"the most blatant calculated intimidation I have ever seen anywhere in the world\". Vale finished in sixth spot with 53 points, four short of promoted Notts County.

His team struggled with poor discipline \u2013 Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Midway through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of \u00a38,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for \u00a330,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy.

McGrath pointed out that 'forwards are much more important now' as the Football League changed the system so that wins were rewarded with three points instead of two. For the first time in a decade, the club made it into the second round of the League Cup. Colin Tartt was re-signed from Chesterfield for \u00a315,000 as the club made a push for promotion. Injury problems eventually made promotion unattainable, though 70 points and a 7th-place finish gave cause for optimism, despite a club record low attendance for a league game of 1,924 in a goalless draw with York City on 1 May. Twelve home draws resulted in McGrath's observation that 'we blew it at Burslem'.

On 1 October, Vale beat Wrexham 1\u20130 in an 'ugly' game that saw five players booked and Colin Tartt and opposition player Arfon Griffiths separated by police following a scrap in the tunnel. Later in the month Roy Cross badly injured his knee, and would later have to leave the professional game due to the injury. Vale slipped down the league, and by Christmas they were sixth from bottom, with only John Woodward in good form. Lee then took out striker Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. He also changed the formation from 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133, hoping to give Brian Horton more room in the centre of the park. After an upturn in form in the new year, Bill Summerscales broke his neck, and Lee departed for the management position at Blackburn Rovers. Lee had been seen to have done an excellent job with little money. In his place club legend Roy Sproson was appointed as caretaker manager, who advocated an 'entertaining' style of play as opposed to battling for every point. Winning his first match 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town, he cracked his head on the concrete trainer's box after leaping up to celebrate McLaren's goal. On 17 February, 8,505 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 3\u20131 win over high-flying Bristol Rovers in an experimental Sunday game. Later Leonard returned to Villa Park at the end of his loan deal, and \u00a35,000 was not enough to tempt Villa to part with his services permanently. From mid-March Vale went eleven games without a win, and on 25 March they could have ended this run, but 'a shocking mistake' from Alan Boswell handed Walsall an equalizer as he palmed a header into his own net. The team continued to rack up yellow cards, and following a warning from The Football Association, Sproson arranged for local referee Roy Capey to lecture the players on sportsmanship. In the middle of April, Sproson was given the management job on a permanent basis, despite his team falling to fifth from bottom. Sproson stated that he was 'calculated' and 'controlled', compared to Lee who 'fizzes like a bottle of pop'. By the time they broke their poor run with a 2\u20131 home win over managerless Charlton Athletic, other results had already ensured their safety from the drop.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Colin Tartt"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Colin Tartt"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Colin Tartt", "|4||MF||||Colin Tartt||4||1||0||5"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Vale's form tailed off, though Terry Alcock returned briefly to play a handful of games.

In their places were new signings Alan Lamb (\u00a35,000 from Preston North End) and Peter Sutcliffe (\u00a33,000 from Stockport County), whilst a fit again Cullerton was like a new signing. The club had drifted into the bottom four, but a six match unbeaten run with a prolific Cullerton took them to safety. In the background was an ongoing power struggle in the boardroom. In late-March they then received a 6\u20132 beating at Wrexham and then a 4\u20130 beating from Chesterfield at Saltergate. The club suffered an injury crisis in April, with both Keith Chadwick and John Brodie having been forced to retire through injury. Relegation was avoided however with six points from the final five games. The final game of the season was against Rotherham United, who needed a six-goal win margin to gain promotion.

Instead Tony Sealy arrived on loan, this time from Queens Park Rangers. On 6 February Mark Chamberlain scored a memorable goal at Field Mill when he stood off the pitch to avoid being caught offside, then returned to tackle a startled Rod Arnold and tap the ball into an empty net. Mansfield Town manager Stuart Boam was so enraged that the goal stood that he raced onto the pitch to verbally abuse the linesman. In March, Johnny Miller had to retire with a knee injury. On 20 March, Mark Harrison conceded 'a crazy goal' from Hull City left-back Dennis Booth at Boothferry Park, whose fifty yard free kick hit the back of the net after several bounces.
