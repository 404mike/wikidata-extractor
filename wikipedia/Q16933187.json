His family moved to London in 1835, and he was educated at University College School and University College, London, where he began a lifelong friendship with Walter Bagehot, whose works he later edited. He took his degree in 1845, and was awarded the gold medal for philosophy. Meanwhile, he had also studied for short periods at Heidelberg and Berlin, and in 1847 he entered Manchester New College with the idea of becoming a minister like his father, and studied there under James Martineau. He was not, however, called on by any church, and for some time his future was unsettled. In 1851, he married his cousin, Anne Roscoe, and became joint-editor with John Langton Sanford of the Inquirer, the main Unitarian periodical. His innovations and unconventional views about stereotyped Unitarian doctrines caused alarm, and in 1853 he resigned. His health had broken down, and he visited the West Indies, where his wife died of yellow fever."]}, {"page": "Nathaniel Bacon (politician)", "response": ["* John Langton Sanford, Studies and Illustrations of the Great Rebellion (1858) p.\u00a0278"]}, {"page": "Meredith Townsend", "response": ["Towsend published Asia and Europe in 1901, the studies presenting the conclusions formed by him in a long life devoted to the subject of the relations between Asia and Europe.
