The Scots had a goal disallowed in the first half after the umpires decided that the ball had cleared the tape that was used to represent the crossbar.Tape was used before crossbars were introduced in Scotland, although crossbars were being used under the Sheffield Rules at this time. See: The term \"crossbar\" used by Sheffield as early as March 1872: Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle (London, England), Saturday, 9 March 1872; Issue 2,697. The latter part of the match saw the Scots defence under pressure by the heavier English forwards. The Scots played two full backs, two half backs and six forwards. The English played only one full back, one half back and eight forwards. Since three defenders were required for a ball played to be onside, the English system was virtually a ready-made offside trap. Scotland came closest to winning the match when, in the closing stages, a Robert Leckie shot landed on top of the tape.", "|FW ||||Robert Leckie"]}, {"page": "Leckie", "response": ["* Robert Leckie (author)", "* Robert Leckie (aviator)", "* Robert Leckie (footballer)"]}, {"page": "1873\u201374 Scottish Cup", "response": ["Both goals came in the second half courtesy of Scotland internationals Billy MacKinnon and Robert Leckie.
