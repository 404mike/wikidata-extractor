Hollway (1841 \u2013 1907) was an English metallurgist and chemist who, in the 1870s, unsuccessfully tried out smelting and refining of copper using a converter based on the Bessemer process.\nAlthough his attempts failed, conceding to the French engineers Pierre Manh\u00e8s and Paul David, the honor of the invention of the Manh\u00e8s-David process in 1880, the abundant communication he made on his failures constitute a significant contribution to the development and perfecting their process.", "link_mentions": {}}}
