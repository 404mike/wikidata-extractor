He came to prominence in the mid-1960s as the bass guitarist and occasional lead vocalist of the English rock band The Zombies. White is one of the main composers of the Zombies' music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019 as a member of the Zombies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees", "response": ["| Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson, Colin Blunstone, Hugh Grundy, and Chris White"]}, {"page": "The Zombies", "response": ["Arnold lost interest in the band and chose to leave to become a physician; he was replaced by Chris White. After winning a beat-group competition sponsored by the London Evening News, they signed a recording contract with Decca and recorded their first hit, \"She's Not There\". It was released in mid-1964 and peaked at number 12 in the UK, becoming their only UK Top 40 hit. The tune began to catch on in the United States and eventually climbed to number 2 in early December.

L-R: Chris White, Colin Blunstone, Hugh Grundy,  Paul Atkinson and Rod Argent.Like many other British groups, the Zombies travelled to the United States to tour on the momentum of their hit single. Among their early US gigs were Murray the K's Christmas shows at the Brooklyn Fox Theatre, where the band played seven performances a day. On 12 January 1965 the band made their first in-person appearance on US television on the first episode of NBC's Hullabaloo and played \"She's Not There\" and their new single \"Tell Her No\" to a screaming, hysterical audience full of teenage girls.", "In the UK, the Zombies' follow-up single to \"She's Not There\" was written by Chris White.  \"Leave Me Be\" was unsuccessful in the UK and as a result was not issued as an A-side in the US.  It did appear as the B side of their second US single, \"Tell Her No\". Penned by Rod Argent, \"Tell Her No\" became another big seller in 1965, peaking at No.6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March. As the band's third UK single, \"Tell Her No\" failed to make the Top 40, peaking at number 42. Subsequent recordings such as \"She's Coming Home\", \"Whenever You're Ready\", \"Is This the Dream\", \"Indication\" and \"Gotta Get a Hold of Myself\" failed to achieve the success of the previous two singles (although the Zombies had continued success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, which led to a series of concerts in 1967). A song by the Zombies released only as a B-side (to \"Whenever You're Ready\") in both the US and UK in 1965, \"I Love You\" subsequently became a sizeable hit for the group People! in the United States in 1968.", "The Zombies' first UK album, Begin Here (1965) was an interesting mixture of original songs and rhythm and blues cover versions. Of the eight original tracks, Rod Argent supplied the album's biggest hit, \"She's Not There\", and the songs \"Woman\", \"I Remember When I Loved Her\", plus \"The Way I Feel Inside\" which was the shortest track on the album at 1:28. It might have been shorter, had not their recording manager and producer Ken Jones added the sounds of footsteps and a coin dropping, which contributed to the feeling of alienation that the song projected. Bassist Chris White provided \"I Can't Make Up My Mind\", the quirky \"I Don't Want to Know\", plus the beaty \"What More Can I Do\" which, at 1:38, is the second-shortest cut on the album and contains a simple but distinctive drum riff.  The final original was an instrumental written by Ken Jones, \"Work 'n' Play\".", "In 2017, the four surviving original members (Colin Blunstone, Rod Argent, Chris White and Hugh Grundy) re-united for a North American tour marking the 50th anniversary of the recording of Odessey and Oracle.

Record producer Ken Jones had dubbed live horn parts directly onto the mono mix.
