He turned his attention to Theseus' speech about \"the lunatic, the lover, and the poet\" and to Hippolyta's response to it. He regarded Theseus as the voice of Shakespeare himself and the speech as a call for imaginative audiences. He also viewed Bottom as a lucky man on whom Fortune showered favours beyond measure. He was particularly amused by the way Bottom reacts to the love of the fairy queen: completely unfazed. Maginn argued that \"Theseus would have bent in reverent awe before Titania. Bottom treats her as carelessly as if she were the wench of the next-door tapster.\" Finally, Maginn thought that Oberon should not be blamed for Titania's humiliation, which is the result of an accident. He viewed Oberon as angry with the \"caprices\" of his queen, but unable to anticipate that her charmed affections would be reserved for a weaver with a donkey's head."]}, {"page": "William Harrison Ainsworth", "response": ["Ainsworth hoped to start publishing Windsor Castle in his magazine by April, but he was delayed when his mother died on 15 March 1842.

Humphreys, a Quaker, was a companion during Croker's excursions into the south 1812\u20131815.

Disraeli travelled to Chiefswood (near Melrose) to persuade John Gibson Lockhart (Sir Walter Scott's son-in-law) to edit the paper; Lockhart declined, but agreed to serve as editor of Murray's Quarterly Review and consult on the management of the paper.

Compared to the rather staid tone of The Quarterly Review, the other main Tory work, Maga was ferocious and combative.

Never trusted with the editorship, he nevertheless wrote much of the magazine along with the other major contributors John Gibson Lockhart and William Maginn.

The Irish periodical writer and journalist William Maginn mentions the wine amongst other spirits in his poem \"Inishowen\" c. 1822. In the late work of the German novelist Theodor Fontane \"Der Stechlin\" (1898) the wine is mentioned to be served after lunch in a convent and is characterized to be of higher grade than a Montefiascone. Hart Crane wrote a poem titled \"Lachrymae Christi\" included in his 1926 debut collection White Buildings. The Dutch novelist Harry Mulisch mentions the wine together with the island of Capri in his 1987 novel The Pupil.
