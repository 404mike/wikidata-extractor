His father was a farmer and shopkeeper.Flaherty, Matthew James. \"John & Michael Banim.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 25 July 2021 At age four, his parents sent him to a local dame schools where he learned the basics of reading and grammar. At age five, Banim was sent to the English Academy at Kilkenny where his older brother Michael (1796\u20131874) was a student. This school is described in Michael Banim's novel Father Connell. It is believed to have been situated in Rothe House. After five years at the English Academy, John Banim was sent to a seminary run by a Reverent Magrath, considered to be the finest Roman Catholic school in Ireland. After a year at the seminary, Banim transferred to another academy run by a teacher named Terence Doyle.", "Banim published a volume of miscellaneous essays anonymously in 1824, called Revelations of the Dead Alive. He met the American author Washington Irving the same year, finding him to be a good hearted and genuine man, while other literary celebrities he had met had disappointed him. The first series of Tales of the O'Hara Family appeared in April 1825, achieving immediate and decided success. One of the most powerful of them, Crohoore of the Bill Hook, was by Michael Banim. The two had worked on the Tales through correspondence during 1823\u201324, periodically sending each other their completed work to be read and criticised. Banim and Gerald Griffin were still close friends, despite a misunderstanding that had temporarily parted them, and Griffin was often called upon to offer criticism on the Tales.", "Upon visiting John in London, in the summer of 1826, Michael found that his brother's illness had aged him and made him appear much older than his 28 years. The next effort of the \"O'Hara family\" was almost entirely the production of Michael. The Croppy, a Tale of 1798 (1828), a novel of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, is hardly equal to the earlier tales, though it contains some wonderfully vigorous passages. The Mayor of Windgap, and The Ghost Hunter (both by Michael Banim), The Denounced (1830) and The Smuggler (1831) followed in quick succession, and were received with considerable favour. Most of these deal with the darker and more painful phases of life, but the feeling shown in his last, Father Connell, is brighter and more tender.", "While in France, Banim suffered a stroke; in 1835 he returned to Kilkenny by slow stages. He returned to Ireland in July 1835, taking up residence in Dublin. On meeting him again in August, Michael Banim found his condition to be that of a complete invalid. He was often in pain and had to use opiates to sleep, but during the short intervals between the attacks of his illness, he was able to enjoy conversation and the company of his brother and friends. In September he returned to Kilkenny and was received with an address from the citizens of Kilkenny showing their appreciation of him, and a subscription from them of \u00a385. After a short stay in his childhood home, he settled in Windgap Cottage, then a short distance from Kilkenny. He passed the remainder of his life there, dying on 13 August 1842 at the age of forty-four.", "thumb|right|160px|1865 cover of The Bit o' Writin by John and Michael Banim.", "*John and Michael Banim bibliography"]}, {"page": "1825 in literature", "response": ["*John and Michael Banim \u2013 Tales of the O'Hara Family"]}, {"page": "Irish prose fiction", "response": ["William Carleton (1794\u20131869) and John Banim (1798\u20131842) wrote novels that depicted with some realism the lives of Irish peasantry.
