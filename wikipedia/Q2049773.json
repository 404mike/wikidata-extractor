Their background differed from Massive Attack in many ways: one of Portishead's primary influences was 1960s and 1970s film soundtrack LPs. Nevertheless, Portishead shared the scratchy, jazz-sample-based aesthetic of early Massive Attack (whom Barrow had briefly worked with during the recording of Blue Lines), and the sullen, fragile vocals of Gibbons also brought them wide acclaim. In 1995, Dummy was awarded the Mercury Music Prize as the best British album of the year, giving trip-hop as a genre its greatest exposure yet. Portishead's music, seen as cutting edge in its film-noir feel and stylish, yet emotional appropriations of past sounds, was also widely imitated, causing the band to recoil from the trip-hop label they had inadvertently helped popularize."]}, {"page": "Theremin", "response": ["Although credited with a \"Thereman\"  on the track \"Mysterons\" from the album Dummy, Portishead actually used a monophonic synthesizer to achieve theremin-like effects, as confirmed by Adrian Utley, who is credited as playing the instrument; on the songs \"Half Day Closing\", \"Humming\", \"The Rip\", and \"Machine Gun\" he has actually used a custom made theremin."]}, {"page": "Portishead (band)", "response": ["Portishead is an English band formed in 1991 in Bristol.

That year they recorded their first song for the album, \"It Could Be Sweet\". They then met Adrian Utley while they were recording at the Coach House Studios in Bristol, and Utley heard the first song Barrow and Gibbons had recorded, and began to exchange ideas on music. The resulting first album by Portishead, Dummy, was released in 1994. The cover features a still from the band's own short film To Kill a Dead Man.

Portishead's Adrian Utley explained that they found the music to Get Carter inspiring as \"it was done quickly and cheaply with only a few instruments, and it had to be intensely creative to disguise its limitations\". The Human League album Dare contains a track covering the Get Carter theme, although it was only a version of the sparse leitmotif that opens and closes the film as opposed to the full-blooded jazz piece that accompanies the train journey. Stereolab also covers Roy Budd's theme on their album Aluminum Tunes, although they call their version \"Get Carter\", as opposed to its proper title, \"Main Theme (Carter Takes A Train)\". This Stereolab version was subsequently used as a sample in the song \"Got Carter\" by 76. The Finnish rock band Laika & the Cosmonauts cover the film's theme on their 1995 album The Amazing Colossal Band. BB Davis & the Red Orchidstra released a version of the film's title theme in 1999. Jah Wobble produced a dub cover version of the theme tune in 2009.
