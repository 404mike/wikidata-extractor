Beginning his working life as a mathematically trained civilian instructor for the Royal Navy, he later became Professor of Modern History at King's College London and a co-founder of the Navy Records Society.  A prolific writer of lives, he penned the biographies of more than 900 naval personalities for the Dictionary of National Biography.", "link_mentions": {}}}
