A Catholic convert from Presbyterianism, she bought a house to form a community after being convinced wider action was necessary to help the infirm, after visiting a semi-blind elderly woman caring for two people. As her work began to steadily increase, Garson purchased a second house which allowed her to expand and began to provide sheltered accommodation. The community was later recognised as a pious union in 1959, and she became known as \"Sister Mary Garson\". Her group later expanded overseas and adopted the Rule of St Benedict in 1978.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Garson (surname)", "response": ["*Mary Garson, Australian biochemist and academic", "*Mary Garson (nun) (1921\u20132007), Scottish nun"]}]}}
