It was reduced in size and converted for use as a tenanted farmhouse. Due to neglect, the house gradually fell into a dilapidated state. By the end of the 20th century, practically only the East Wing survived. However, the neglect resulted in a rare example of Tudor royal state apartments being preserved virtually intact. The house was purchased at auction in 1984 by Eva Dorothy Brown on behalf of the Bristol Visual and Environmental Group (BVEG). An extensive restoration was completed only recently."]}]}}
