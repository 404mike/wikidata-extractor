He is professor of journalism at Kingston University London and in 2011 was a founder of Hacked Off, which campaigns for a free and accountable press. His books include Were You Still Up for Portillo?

Twigg was forced to give up his role as general secretary of the Fabian Society following this unexpected victory in what had been regarded as a safe Conservative seat.

He also identified The Jewish Chronicles owner Robbie Gibb as an obstacle to an IPSO investigation into standards at the paper.

Dacre claimed legislation passed in the last 20 years already helped stop necessary journalistic enquiry, and meant that the press was \"already on the very cusp of being over regulated\".
