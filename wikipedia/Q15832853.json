Brooks-Baker preferred to be known as \"Brookie\" (to the extent that the record of his death in 2005 was made under both his real name and 'Brookie Brooks-Baker'). He adopted the \"Brooks-\" part of his surname when the French authorities refused him permission to add the family name \"Brooks\" as a middle name for his daughters. He was often credited as 'H. B. Brooks-Baker'. In later years, Brooks-Baker was confined to a wheelchair, owing to lifelong ramifications from his childhood polio.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2005-2008, second supplementary volume, ed.
