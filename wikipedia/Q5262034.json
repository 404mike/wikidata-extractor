Mrs Abbey encouraged her husband to secure more ambitious commissions, although with their marriage commencing when both were in their forties, the couple remained childless. After her husband's death, Gertrude was active in preserving her husband's legacy, writing about his work and giving her substantial collection and archive to Yale. Edwin had been a keen supporter of the newly founded British School at Rome (BSR), so, in his memory, she donated \u00a36000 to assist in building the artists' studio block and, in 1926, founded the Incorporated Edwin Austin Abbey Memorial Scholarships. The scholarships were established to enable British and American painters to pursue their practice. Recipients of Abbey funding \u2013 Scholars and, more recently, Fellows \u2013 devote their scholarship to working in the studios at the BSR, where there has, ever since, been at least one Abbey-funded artist in residence. Previous award holders include Stephen Farthing, Chantal Joffe and Spartacus Chetwynd. The Abbey Fellowships (formerly 'Awards') were established in their present form in 1990, and the Abbey studios also host the BSR's other fine art residencies, such as the Derek Hill Foundation Scholarship and the Sainsbury Scholarship in Painting and Drawing. A bust of Edwin Abbey, by Sir Thomas Brock, stands in the courtyard of the BSR. Edwin also left bequests of his works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and to the National Gallery in London."]}, {"page": "List of museums in the Republic of Ireland", "response": ["| Glebe House and Gallery ||  || Letterkenny || Donegal  || Ulster || Border ||Art || website, early-19th-century Regency House decorated with William Morris textiles, Islamic and Japanese art, features the Derek Hill collection of works by leading 20th-century artists"]}, {"page": "List of Irish artists", "response": ["*Derek Hill (1916\u20132000) \u2013 English-born portrait and landscape painter in Ireland"]}, {"page": "1999 in Ireland", "response": ["* 13 January \u2013 Derek Hill becomes the eleventh honorary citizen of Ireland"]}, {"page": "1981 in Ireland", "response": ["*English-born painter Derek Hill donated St. Columb's Rectory, near Churchill, County Donegal (his home since 1954), along with a considerable collection including work by Pablo Picasso, Edgar Degas, Georges Braque, Graham Sutherland and Jack Butler Yeats, to the Irish State."]}, {"page": "1954 in Ireland", "response": ["* English-born painter Derek Hill settles at St Columb's Rectory, near Churchill, County Donegal."]}, {"page": "Tory Island", "response": ["Since the 1950s, the island has been home to a small community of artists, and has its own art gallery.
