According to The Guardian, \"Few books have been more intensely discussed by professional medieval historians. Largely as a consequence of this work, the word \u201cfeudalism\u201d, or the \u201cF-word\u201d, as it came to be called by historians, began to lose currency among British medievalists.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Feudalism", "response": ["A broader definition of feudalism, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), includes not only the obligations of the warrior nobility but the obligations of all three estates of the realm: the nobility, the clergy, and the peasantry, all of whom were bound by a system of manorialism; this is sometimes referred to as a \"feudal society\". Since the publication of Elizabeth A. R. Brown's \"The Tyranny of a Construct\" (1974) and Susan Reynolds's Fiefs and Vassals (1994), there has been ongoing inconclusive discussion among medieval historians as to whether feudalism is a useful construct for understanding medieval society.\"The Problem of Feudalism: An Historiographical Essay\", by Robert Harbison, 1996, Western Kentucky University.Charles West, Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation Between Marne and Moselle, c. 800\u2013c. 1100 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013).", "In 1939, the Austrian historian  subordinated the feudal state as secondary to his concept of a Personenverbandsstaat (personal interdependency state), understanding it in contrast to the territorial state. This form of statehood, identified with the Holy Roman Empire, is described as the most complete form of medieval rule, completing conventional feudal structure of lordship and vassalage with the personal association between the nobility.\u00a0But the applicability of this concept to cases outside of the Holy Roman Empire has been questioned, as by Susan Reynolds. The concept has also been questioned and superseded in German histography because of its bias and reductionism towards legitimating the F\u00fchrerprinzip.", "In 1974, the American historian Elizabeth A. R. Brown rejected the label feudalism as an anachronism that imparts a false sense of uniformity to the concept. Having noted the current use of many, often contradictory, definitions of feudalism, she argued that the word is only a construct with no basis in medieval reality, an invention of modern historians read back \"tyrannically\" into the historical record. Supporters of Brown have suggested that the term should be expunged from history textbooks and lectures on medieval history entirely. In Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted (1994),Reynolds, Susan, Fiefs and Vassals: The Medieval Evidence Reinterpreted.

Adrian Hastings has claimed that England's Anglo-Saxon kings mobilized mass nationalism in their struggle to repel Norse invasions.

Hastings argues for a strong renewal of English nationalism (following a hiatus after the Norman conquest) beginning with the translation of the complete bible into English by the Wycliffe circle in the 1380s, positing that English nationalism and the English nation have been continuous since that time.Adrian Hastings, The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism.
