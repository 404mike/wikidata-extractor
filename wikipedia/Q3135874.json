Born in Ireland, he was educated at St Peter's College, Wexford, and at the Franciscan College of St Isidore, Rome, Sheil was sent to the British Colony of New South Wales in Australia after being ordained a priest.  There, he served as an educator and administrator, before poor health saw him move to Ballarat as archdeacon.\nIn 1866, Sheil became the third Bishop of Adelaide.  His reign was characterised by poor administration, with his extensive absence from the diocese contributing to severe factionalism within the clergy.  Sheil's mismanagement culminated in his excommunication of Mary MacKillop, who later became Australia's first saint. He died in March 1872, rescinding his excommunication of MacKillop on his deathbed.", "link_mentions": {}}}
