He raced in Formula One from 1959 to 1962, participating in six World Championship Grands Prix and numerous non-Championship races.Prior to Formula One, Greene had a successful career in sportscars. In 1956 using a Cooper T39 he competed in 11 national level races finishing outside the top six on only one occasion, with two wins and three other podium finishes.After retiring from driving, Greene became a team manager in Formula 5000 and sports car racing. He worked for Hexagon of Highgate in London running their newly formed motorcycle business in the mid 1970s. At that time he also managed Alain de Cadenet's Le Mans racing team. He died from cardiac arrest on 8 March 2021 at the age of 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1959 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Keith Greene", "|  Keith Greene"]}, {"page": "1960 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Keith Greene", "|  Keith Greene"]}, {"page": "1961 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Keith Greene", "|  Keith Greene"]}, {"page": "1962 British Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Keith Greene", "|  Keith Greene"]}, {"page": "1962 German Grand Prix", "response": ["Three new cars appeared - the new BRM V8-engined Gilby, driven by Keith Greene, retired after about half the race with gearbox problems.

This was its only appearance, and a hard worked Lucien Bianchi was only allowed to start thanks to the fact that several faster racers had not finished the minimum-required five laps. Gurney's fastest qualifying lap was 8:47.2; the ENB's fastest lap was 10:40.7, nearly two minutes slower. Most importantly, Jack Brabham's new BT3 finally appeared after a marathon effort by his mechanics. He spun the main bearings on the first day practice, and qualified with an engine built using parts from Trevor Taylor's car (his engine bent a valve). He started the race from the rear of the field, with the Climax engine from his Lotus 24. He climbed to ninth place by the end of the first lap, but then his throttle broke and he had to retire after nine laps.

Qualifying resulted in pole position for Jack Brabham, a second faster than Graham Hill's BRM with Bruce McLaren's Cooper and Jo Bonnier's BRM making it a balanced front row. The start saw three cars stall: Graham Hill (his second race running) and the two BRP Coopers of Brooks and Henry Taylor. McLaren was second on the first lap but soon dropped behind Bonnier and the factory Lotus of Innes Ireland. Ireland then passed Bonnier to take second place. Graham Hill drove a storming race from the back of the field and worked his way back, passing Ireland for second after 37 laps and setting off after Brabham. To the delight of the crowd, he caught him and on lap 55 took the lead. Further back Surtees displaced Ireland in third place.

Greene had lost an arm in a bicycle accident at 16 but went on to compete in many UK speed trials very successfully in the early 1950s.

The team competed in 12 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, including 6 with cars of their own construction, but scored no World Championship points. The Gilby cars were constructed by Syd Greene for his son Keith to drive, having previously entered a Maserati 250F for Roy Salvadori and Ivor Bueb and also a Cooper for Greene Jr. Keith Greene later became better known as a team manager in Formula One and sports car racing. Gilby made its debut in the 1954 French Grand Prix with the Maserati, for Salvadori, who also drove for the team in  and , and the team's last event was the 1962 Italian Grand Prix.
