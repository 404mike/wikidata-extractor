It may be labouring the obvious to say so but it is too little recognised in art journalism now that a picture is a unique and private event in the life of the painter: an object made alone with a man and a blank canvas... A real painting is something which happens to the painter once in a given minute; it is unique in that it will never happen again and in this sense is an impossible object. It is judged by the painter simply as a success or failure without qualification. And it is something which happens in life not in art: a picture which was merely the product of art would not be very interesting and could tell us nothing we were not already aware of.\" \u2014  \"The Painter in the Press\", X, October 1960. It could be added that Swift did not subscribe to the \"idea of progress in the arts\" (\u201cOfficial Art and the Modern Painter\u201d, X magazine, November 1959), believing that \"the mass of modern art theory that developed around the fantastic changes of this century's painting can be largely ignored.\"(\"Nano Reid\", Envoy, March 1950) (In 1952 The Irish Times noted that Swift's work was \u201cintensely personal and strangely disturbing\u201d.\"...an atmosphere of heightened realism which\u2026 is intensely personal and strangely disturbing.\" \u2014 G.H.G. (usual signature for Tony Gray), The Irish Times, 3 October 1952)", "\"Irish critics got a look at the work of a tousled young (25) man named Paddy Swift and tossed their caps in the air. Paddy's 30 canvases are as grey and gloomy as Dublin itself \u2014 harshly realistic paintings of dead birds and rabbits, frightened-looking girls and twisted potted plants. Their fascination is in the merciless, sharply etched details, as oppressive and inquiring as a back-room third degree. Dublin Understands. Wrote Critic Tony Gray in the Irish Times: Swift 'unearths [from his subjects] not a story, nor a decorative pattern, nor even a mood, but some sort of tension which is a property of their existence.' Said the Irish Press: 'An almost embarrassing candor... Here is a painter who seems to have gone back to the older tradition and to have given the most searching consideration to the composition of his painting.' Dublin, which likes authors who write with a shillelagh, understood an artist who painted with one. The Word Is Tension. By 1950, Paddy was in Paris... Nights, he went to the galleries, and there he found what he wanted to do. He liked such old French masters as the 17th century's Nicolas Poussin, the 19th century's Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, such moderns as Switzerland's Alberto Giacometti and Britain's Francis Bacon. The much-admired decorative style of the Matisses is not for Paddy Swift. 'Art,' he thinks, 'is obviously capable of expressing something more closely related to life than these elegant designs.' His main idea is to suggest the tensions he finds in life. 'I believe when you bring, say, a plant into a room, everything in that room changes in relation to it. This tension \u2014 tension is the only word for it \u2014 can be painted.'\" This may have been Swift's only interview. A motif of his work at this time was his bird imagery, which appear to have symbolic overtones, and may have even been a subtle form of self-portraiture.\"A motif of Swift's work at this time was his bird imagery, which appeared to him to have symbolic overtones, and may even have been a subtle form of self-portraiture. Certainly Seamus Kelly, in his 'Quidnunc' column a few days after the Waddington opening, noted that the artist himself resembled one of his own birds \u2014 beaknosed, sharp-eyed, wiry, with a kind of nervous, intense presence. The self-portrait mentioned bears this out, with its questioning, almost withdrawn look. This is the typical Irish artist-intellectual of the post-war years...\" \u2014 Brian Fallon (critic), \"Patrick Swift and Irish Art\" (1993), Patrick Swift: An Irish Painter in Portugal, Gandon Editions, 2001 From early on he was involved with literary magazines,\"From early on Swift was associated with literary magazines...\" \u2014 Brian Fallon, \"The fall and rise of Patrick Swift\", The Irish Times, 11 June 1992 such as The Bell and Envoy, contributing the occasional critical piece on art and artists he admired (e.g.Nano Reid,\"Nano Reid\", by Patrick Swift, Envoy, March 1950;article who painted Swift's portrait in 1950).
