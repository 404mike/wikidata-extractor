He scored his first goal in the Football League seven days later, in a 3\u20130 win over Reading at Elm Park. However, after breaking an ankle on 26 January 1931, in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Everton, he lost his place to Dennis Izon and failed to win it back upon his recovery. He played just four games the next season and was given a free transfer in May 1932. He moved on to Norwich City, Barrow and Carlisle United."]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Dennis Izon"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Dennis Izon"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Dennis Izon"]}, {"page": "Izon", "response": ["* Dennis Izon (1907\u20131967), English football player"]}]}}
