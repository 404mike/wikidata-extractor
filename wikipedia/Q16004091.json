Born in Glasgow, he lived in Manchester from an early age and played football in the Manchester amateur leagues before being signed by Manchester United, initially as an amateur. He turned professional in November 1919, although it was not until 2 April 1920 that he made his debut, starting at outside left in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Bradford Park Avenue. That turned out to be his only appearance for Manchester United, as he rejected the terms of their contract offer ahead of the 1920\u201321 season and signed instead for Swansea Town. Again, he found first-team football difficult to come by, playing just three times in Swansea's Third Division campaign, and he joined Tranmere Rovers for the 1921\u201322 season. There, he made 23 appearances and scored three goals in the Third Division, adding a further two goals in the FA Cup. He was released at the end of the season and replaced by another former Manchester United outside left, James Robinson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Prentice", "response": ["John Prentice may refer to:", "*John Prentice (businessman), chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council", "*John Prentice (cartoonist)", "*John Prentice (footballer, born 1898)", "*John Prentice (footballer, born 1926) ", "*John Prentice, fictional character played by Sidney Poitier in the 1967 film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"]}, {"page": "John Prentice (1920s footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Prentice (footballer, born 1898)"]}, {"page": "John Prentice (footballer born 1898)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Prentice (footballer, born 1898)"]}]}}
