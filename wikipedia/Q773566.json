He was the son of a British army surgeon.\nWenham's trailblazing report, \"Aerial Locomotion,\" was published in the Society's journal and reprinted in widely distributed aeronautical publications in the 1890s, including Octave Chanute's \"Progress In Flying Machines\". The paper introduced the idea of superposed wings in a flying machine, a concept that Wenham had tested in 1858 with a multiwing glider, although it did not actually fly. In 1866 he patented the design, which became the basis for biplanes, triplanes and multiplanes that took to the air as gliders in the 1890s, and as airplanes in the early decades of the 20th century. Superposed wings increased the lifting area and avoided the structural problems of excessive wing length. According to some sources John Stringfellow was influenced by Wenham's works or possibly even by his personal communication when creating his steam engine triplane model aircraft, which was demonstrated publicly at the international exhibition in the Crystal Palace in 1868.Wenham first tested superposed wings in 1866 with a model that resembled a Venetian blind. He tried several variants with some success, then decided to build a machine which could support a man. He tested it in the evening in a strong breeze. He was taken by surprise when, as he wrote, \"A sudden gust caught up the experimenter, who was carried some distance from the ground\". A monoplane attempt that same year was inconsequential (Flying Machines, 1911).In 1871 Wenham and colleague John Browning designed and constructed what was probably the world's first wind tunnel. Their experiments showed that high aspect ratio wings\u2014long and narrow\u2014had a better lift-to-drag ratio than short stubby wings with the same lifting area. Writing about his work, Wenham may have been the first scientist to use the word \"aeroplane\".Aviation writer Carroll Gray says Wenham's work may have been an important influence on the Wright brothers:\n\nIt is striking to note that at least four significant aerial vehicle design elements suggested by Wenham in 1866 can be seen on the series of successful Wright gliders and on the 1903 Wright Flyer: 1) superimposed wings, 2) vertical upright supports between the superimposed wings, 3) the prone position of the operator, as in Wenham's design with superimposed wings, and 4) that turning in flight ought be accomplished by means of generating more lift on one side of the aerial vehicle than on the other, rather than through the use of a simple rudder. It is also important to restate that Wenham's paper \"Aerial Locomotion\" was readily available to Wilbur Wright (as well as to Orville) in the 1895 \"Aeronautical Annual\" which the Smithsonian Institution recommended to Wilbur Wright in June 1899 (along with other aeronautical reading material), and which he soon thereafter obtained and read.\nAeronautics was Wenham's \"spare time\" pursuit. In his regular career he designed marine engines, ship's propellers, gas and hot air engines, and high pressure boilers. As an inventor of hot air engines, Wenham followed the principles of George Cayley. He also invented the Wenham gas lamp, which enjoyed a decade or two of popularity before being displaced by electric incandescent lighting. Wenham was highly skilled in the use of microscopes. He published many papers on the subject and designed stands, objective lenses and prisms, fabricating some of the latter himself. He was important in the history of photography, having given Francis Frith invaluable assistance in producing his 1856 photographs in Egypt.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aerodynamics", "response": ["In 1799, Sir George Cayley became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight (weight, lift, drag, and thrust), as well as the relationships between them,Cayley, George. \"On Aerial Navigation\" Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3  Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy, 1809\u20131810.

In 1871, Francis Herbert Wenham constructed the first wind tunnel, allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces.  Drag theories were developed by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Lord Rayleigh. In 1889, Charles Renard, a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight. Otto Lilienthal, the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag.  Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the Wright brothers flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903."]}, {"page": "Wind tunnel", "response": ["However, the whirling arm does not produce a reliable flow of air impacting the test shape at a normal incidence.

Employing two contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt was more successful, the machine leaving a guidewire to fly freely, achieving thirty yards of straight and level powered flight.First to Fly By Thomas C Parramore, p.46 Francis Herbert Wenham presented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the Royal Aeronautical Society), On Aerial Locomotion.
