His books include Operation Compass 1940 (Osprey, 2000), Tobruk 1941 (Osprey, 2001),  Deception in War (John Murray, 2001), Alamein (John Murray, 2002), Burma: The Forgotten War (John Murray, 2004) and 1812: War with America (Harvard University Press, 2007) which won a Distinguished Book Award from the Society for Military History and was shortlisted for the George Washington Book Prize.Born in Prestatyn, Wales, Latimer was educated at Christleton County High School, Chester. He studied for a geography degree at University College, Swansea but switched course to graduate in oceanography. He worked as an oceanographer until becoming a full-time writer in 1997.In 2003, he became an honorary research fellow at his alma mater (by this time Swansea University) and was appointed as a part-time lecturer in history on the BA (Hons) degree scheme 'War and Society'.  He was also a guest lecturer at the Joint Services Command and Staff College at Shrivenham.Latimer was an enthusiastic part-time soldier. Originally enlisting as a sapper in the Royal Monmouthshire (Militia), he was commissioned in 1986 into the 3rd Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers, Territorial Army. He spent periods attached to regular battalions in Northern Ireland (1989), Australia (1991\u20132) and as an intelligence officer (1992\u20133).Latimer died following a heart attack in January 2009. His book, Buccaneers of the Caribbean: How Piracy Forged an Empire was published posthumously in April 2009.\n\nAccording to Donald R. Hickey:The late Jon Latimer's award-winning 1812: War with America (2007) professed to present the British side of the story, but it does no such thing, and it is so riddled with factual errors and fi lled with so much deceptive, if not fraudulent research, that it should not be used.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Double-Cross System", "response": ["* Jon Latimer, Deception in War, London: John Murray, 2001."]}, {"page": "Joseph Stilwell", "response": ["*Jon Latimer, Burma: The Forgotten War, London: John Murray, 2004.

Latimer identifies other factors, including Hitler's distrust of the Italians, and his unwillingness to risk German troops alongside Italian troops who may have been on the point of a general surrender. The military historian Michael Howard, while describing Mincemeat as \"perhaps the most successful single deception operation of the entire war\", considered Mincemeat and Barclay to have less impact on the course of the Sicily campaign than Hitler's \"congenital obsession with the Balkans\". Macintyre writes that the exact impact of Mincemeat is impossible to calculate. Although the British had expected 10,000 killed or wounded in the first week of fighting, only a seventh of that number became casualties; the navy expected 300 ships would be sunk in the action, but they lost 12. The predicted 90-day campaign was over in 38."]}, {"page": "South-East Asian theatre of World War II", "response": ["* Jon Latimer, Burma: The Forgotten War, London: John Murray, 2004.  * William Slim, Defeat into Victory, London: Cassell, 1956."]}]}}
