A best-selling author in the field of sexual biology his books have been translated into 27 different languages. These include the international bestseller Sperm Wars which was based on his own lab's original research on human sexuality. His work and ideas on the evolution of human behaviour have been featured in many radio and television programmes around the world.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "H. E. Hinton", "response": ["Hinton published 309 scientific papers, many of which were concerned with insect morphology and taxonomy. He founded and edited the Journal of Insect Physiology. He introduced an extra stage in the metamorphosis of insects, the pharate stage, in which the insect has produced a new exoskeleton in preparation for ecdysis but is still enclosed in the remnants of the old one. He was an early proponent of continental drift, based on the close relationship between non-migratory water beetles of the family Elmidae in rivers in New Guinea and northern Australia. He worked extensively on insect eggs, particularly the way in which they respire.  He worked for many years on cryptobiosis, experimenting with a species of African fly that could withstand long periods of dehydration, positing that this might also be the key to space voyaging. In an article in New Scientist, October 1965 he suggested that contrary to the idea that life had evolved from the sea, complex molecules from the earth's atmosphere might have survived long periods of desiccation before being washed down to the sea. His graduate students include Robin Baker and Geoff Parker.  His papers are stored at the University of Bristol, where he worked. Most of his insect collection is housed at the Natural History Museum, London."]}, {"page": "Anisogamy", "response": ["Geoff Parker, Robin Baker and Vic Smith were the first to provide a mathematical model for its evolution that was consistent with modern evolutionary theory.
