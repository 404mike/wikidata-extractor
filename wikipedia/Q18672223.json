Callander had made his fortune in India, and had already purchased the nearby estates of Crichton and Elphinstone. He found the house to be in poor condition, and it was demolished shortly after. Callander hired London-based architect Robert Mitchell to design a replacement house, and the foundation stone was laid on 18 March 1791. Alexander Callander died the following year, and the house was completed by his brother John (later Sir John Callander, Bt.) in 1800.", "The house is considered to be Robert Mitchell's most important architectural work. Mitchell was born in Aberdeen but practised in London from 1782.

The remainder of the estate buildings were designed by Robert Mitchell and built in the 1790s. At the end of a tree-lined vista to the north of the house is the octagonal-plan Temple, originally intended as Alexander Callander's mausoleum. The south entrance to the grounds is known as the Lion Gate, as the gate piers are topped by lion statues made from Coade stone.
