He was a repeat member of the team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics.Tscherniawsky was born in Boston, Lincolnshire in England in 1992. Tscherniawsky, who has cerebral palsy, took up wheelchair basketball at the age of eleven. After visiting Stoke Mandeville at the age of 16, he became part of the GB development squad, focusing on power lifting. He eventually gravitated towards the throwing events, specialising in the shot put and discus. He began competing at the age of 17.\nIn 2009, he competed in both shot put and discus, but by 2010 he dropped the shot to concentrate of discus alone. His personal best in the discus in 2009 was a throw of 21.34m at a meet in Nottingham in September. A year later, back at Nottingham, Tscherniawsky recorded a throw of 27.65 in the discus, his seventh personal best of the year.

His performance in the meets leading up to the 2012 Summer Paralympics saw him qualify for the Great Britain team at the Games in London, competing in the F32-34 discus category. At the Paralympic Games, his best throw of 29.05m equated to 925 points, which saw him finish in 10th place.\nThe next year, Tscherniawsky improved on his personal best in the discus with a distance of 31.51 at the Cheshire & Manchester County Championships in May.
