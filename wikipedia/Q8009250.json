The salve consisted of the patient's blood and human fat, the wound itself being wrapped in wet lint. This doctrine was supported by Wilhelm Fabry, Robert Fludd, and Jan Baptist van Helmont, who attributed the cure to animal magnetism. The clergy held that the weapon cure was wrought by magic and the devil, and their view was set forth by William Foster in Hoplocrisma Spongus, or a Sponge to Wipe away the Weapon-Salve (1631)."]}]}}
