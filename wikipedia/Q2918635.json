He made over 300 Football League appearances, and was capped by the England national football team.Blockley was born in Leicester but began his career with Coventry City, making his debut for them in 1968\u201369. A central defender, he played nearly 150 league matches for Coventry and was capped by the England U23 side. In October 1972 he was snapped up by Arsenal for a fee of \u00a3200,000, as the intended replacement for former captain Frank McLintock. He made his debut for Arsenal in a 1\u20130 loss to Sheffield United on 7 October 1972, and four days later made his full England debut, against Yugoslavia, which finished 1-1.Towards the end of his first season, and playing despite an injury, Blockley's uncertainty in the FA Cup semi-final against Sunderland contributed to Arsenal's defeat, and his relationship with the supporters never really recovered. However, with Frank McLintock leaving Arsenal in the summer of 1973 Blockley became first choice centre back, and early in the 1973-74 season he scored his only league goal for the Gunners, versus Leeds United. However the season was to turn out to be a difficult one for both Blockley and Arsenal, with defeats in both domestic cup competitions to lower-level sides.Many of the club's fans laid the blame at Blockley's feet (Nick Hornby recounts in his memoir Fever Pitch that Blockley was \"an incompetent to rival Ian Ure\"); Bertie Mee would later reflect that signing Blockley was the worst mistake he ever made as Arsenal manager. Blockley's days at Arsenal were numbered \u2013 though he was still at Arsenal at the start of the 1974\u201375 season, he was dropped, and placed on the transfer list. In January 1975 Blockley was sold to Leicester City for \u00a3100,000. In all he played 62 matches for the Gunners, scoring one goal. His England cap against Yugoslavia proved to be his only one.At Leicester, Blockley had somewhat of a mini-renaissance, helping rescue the side from relegation that season, helping them finish seventh in 1975\u201376, and eventually becoming club captain. Blockley struggled with injuries throughout the 1977-78 season, which contributed significantly to Leicester's ultimate relegation. After 76 league matches in three and a half seasons and a brief loan to Derby County where he played one game, he left in 1978 for Notts County. Blockley made 59 league appearances for the Nottingham-based club, before leaving the club at the end of the 1979-80 season to join Enderby Town. He went on to join Gloucester City for the 1981-82 season, playing 15 times.After retiring, Blockley did not opt for a career in coaching or management and instead became a salesman for a power transmission company. He now owns his own business, Transmech.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  Jeff Blockley 52"]}, {"page": "Liam Brady", "response": ["Brady started his career at Arsenal, moving to London to join the side on schoolboy forms in 1971, at the age of 15. He turned professional on his 17th birthday in 1973, and made his debut on 6 October 1973 against Birmingham City as a substitute for Jeff Blockley, and put in an assured performance. However his next match, in a North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, Brady had a poor match, and Arsenal manager Bertie Mee decided from then on to use the young Irishman sparingly for the time being. Brady ended the 1973\u201374 season with 13 appearances (four of them as substitute) to his name. While at Arsenal, and particularly early in his career, Brady was nicknamed \"Chippy\", not for his ability to chip the ball but for his fondness for fish and chips."]}, {"page": "Shepshed Dynamo F.C.", "response": ["* Jeff Blockley"]}, {"page": "Gloucester City A.F.C.", "response": ["* Jeff Blockley \u2013 One cap for England."]}, {"page": "Frank McLintock", "response": ["He was dropped midway through the 1972\u201373 campaign, and reacted badly to the news by exploding with anger towards Mee. He returned to the first team in February following an injury to Jeff Blockley, but was told by Mee his return was only temporary. He made a formal transfer request in March 1973, and in doing so gave up the chance to be granted a testimonial game for ten years' service to the club."]}, {"page": "Geoff Strong", "response": ["He spent a single season at Highfield Road and his experience was helpful in Noel Cantwell's young team. He formed an excellent partnership with a young Jeff Blockley and the Sky Blues set a club record by conceding only 38 league goals. He retired from playing in 1972."]}, {"page": "Romeo Challenger", "response": ["Challenger played in the Leicester Boys' football team with Peter Shilton and Jeff Blockley, who both went on to enjoy professional careers. He is also the Showaddywaddy bandmate of Trevor Oakes \u2013 father of professional footballers Scott and Stefan Oakes.

He scored eight goals in ten matches, including a hat-trick in a 3\u20132 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Filbert Street on 22 March, to help the \"Foxes\" to finish three points above the First Division relegation zone at the end of the 1974\u201375 season. He was one of three regular rotated forwards in the 1975\u201376 campaign, alongside Frank Worthington and Bob Lee, and City went on to finish seventh; he claimed another hat-trick in a 3\u20130 FA Cup victory over Sheffield United on 3 January. He scored three goals at the start of the 1976\u201377 season, but broke Jeff Blockley's cheekbone after punching him during training for what Garland believed was Blockley's rough treatment of the club's apprentices. Garland placed four transfer requests, and was eventually sold back to his hometown club."]}, {"page": "History of Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["Three months after Cantwell's departure, Joe Mercer and Gordon Milne were appointed as joint managers of the club. City had offered the job to Brian Clough, who said that he had been very tempted to take it, but he instead opted to remain at Derby. They started out the 1972\u201373 season with the existing squad, seeking to play in what Mercer called \"the attractive way\". But after failing to win any of the first six games, they began a series of transfers to reshape the team. Notable incoming players included Colin Stein and Tommy Hutchison, both of whom would go on to become highly popular with the supporters, while Jeff Blockley was sold to Arsenal for a club-record \u00a3200,000. The changes worked, as City went eight games unbeaten, including a 2\u20130 win at Arsenal featuring a much-lauded Hutchison goal. They also progressed to the FA Cup quarter final for the third time, but a poor performance at Wolverhampton Wanderers ended that run. League form also suffered and the club finished 19th. The following season started brightly, and wins at home to Liverpool, Manchester City and Derby put City in the top five after ten games. They progressed to the quarter-final of the League Cup and the fifth round of the FA Cup, but suffered narrow defeats in both. The league ended disappointingly again with a 16th-place finish. The club were plunged into financial difficulties in 1974. They purchased Larry Lloyd from Tottenham for \u00a3240,000, with Mick McGuire and Jimmy Holmes due to be sold in the other direction for \u00a3200,000, but the latter deal fell through after the former was already completed and Coventry faced a huge deficit. Derrick Robins left the club in April 1975 due a relocation to South Africa, ending a fifteen-year career at the helm which had transformed the club's history. Joe Mercer left his management position to become a club director at the same time, leaving Milne in sole charge of the team. On the field it was an indifferent season, with patchy league form and an early exit from both cups."]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Blockley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jeff Blockley"]}, {"page": "Blockley (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Jeff Blockley (born 1949), English footballer "]}]}}
