He envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health.  In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.  In 1905 Cabot created one of the first positions of  professional social worker in the world, given to Garnet Pelton, and then to Ida Maud Cannon.Beder, J.

Pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire.  Cannon stayed in the position for forty years and became Head of Social Work at the hospital.  Cabot and Cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients, including art classes for psychiatric patients, low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person's likelihood of developing tuberculosis."]}]}}
