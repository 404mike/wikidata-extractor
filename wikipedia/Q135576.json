The establishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline, in particular, is among Durkheim's largest and most lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism, or structural functionalism. Scholars inspired by Durkheim include Marcel Mauss, Maurice Halbwachs, C\u00e9lestin Bougl\u00e9, Gustave Belot, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Jean Piaget, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Michel Foucault, Clifford Geertz, Peter Berger, social reformer Patrick Hunout, and others."]}, {"page": "Magic (supernatural)", "response": ["Scholars have criticized the idea that magic and religion can be differentiated into two distinct, separate categories. The social anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown suggested that \"a simple dichotomy between magic and religion\" was unhelpful and thus both should be subsumed under the broader category of ritual. Many later anthropologists followed his example."]}, {"page": "Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology", "response": ["In 1926 a British anthropologist specialising in Australian Aboriginal ethnology and ethnography, Professor Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, noted many Aboriginal groups widely distributed across the Australian continent all appeared to share variations of a single (common) myth telling of an unusually powerful, often creative, often dangerous snake or serpent of sometimes enormous size closely associated with the rainbows, rain, rivers, and deep waterholes."]}, {"page": "Erving Goffman", "response": ["Goffman was influenced by Herbert Blumer, \u00c9mile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud, Everett Hughes, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Sch\u00fctz, Georg Simmel and W. Lloyd Warner. Hughes was the \"most influential of his teachers\", according to Tom Burns. Gary Alan Fine and Philip Manning have said that Goffman never engaged in serious dialogue with other theorists, but his work has influenced and been discussed by numerous contemporary sociologists, including Anthony Giddens, J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Pierre Bourdieu."]}, {"page": "Diyari", "response": ["Their kinship system was first studied by Howitt, who took it as exemplifying a form of one of the most socially backward of Australian tribes. Alfred Radcliffe-Brown analysed the Diyari kinship structure as a variant of the Arrernte system. Their moieties were  Matharri and Kararrhu, in accordance with the general  divisions among speakers of Thura-Yura languages in South Australia."]}, {"page": "Totem", "response": ["Early anthropologists sometimes attributed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander totemism to ignorance about procreation, with the entrance of an ancestral spirit individual (the \"totem\") into the woman believed to be the cause of pregnancy (rather than insemination). James George Frazer in Totemism and Exogamy wrote that Aboriginal people \"have no idea of procreation as being directly associated with sexual intercourse, and firmly believe that children can be born without this taking place\". Frazer's thesis has been criticised by other anthropologists, including Alfred Radcliffe-Brown in Nature in 1938."]}, {"page": "Anthropologist", "response": ["Some notable anthropologists include: Edward Burnett Tylor (1832-1917), James George Frazer, Franz Boas, Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski, Elsie Clews Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Margaret Mead, Zora Neale Hurston, Ruth Benedict, Ella Deloria, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Clifford Geertz, Marshall Sahlins, Edward C. Green, Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Paul Rabinow."]}, {"page": "Religious studies", "response": ["Functionalism, in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to teleological explanations.  An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the Pentateuch as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (i.e. a sense of belonging though common practice)."]}, {"page": "Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown", "response": ["#REDIRECTAlfred Radcliffe-Brown"]}, {"page": "Radcliffe", "response": ["* Alfred Radcliffe-Brown (1881\u20131955), English social anthropologist"]}, {"page": "E.

During this visit, to relatives in Tasmania, his father also died. In rather more impoverished circumstances, Grant Watson was educated at Bedales School and Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1909, with first-class honours in natural sciences) after which, at 24, he joined social anthropologist Alfred Brown (later Alfred Radcliffe-Brown) and Daisy Bates on an ethnological expedition in Western Australia. His experiences in the desert country at Southern Cross (near Kalgoorlie) and at Sandstone in the Murchison region, and later at the Aboriginal lock hospitals of Shark Bay, determined him to become a writer.Grant Watson, E.L.
