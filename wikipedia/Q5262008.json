The game against Wrexham finished 4\u20133 to the Welsh club, conceding an 89th-minute winner from Steve Watkin on 8 May 1993. His next appearance for the club came in bizarre circumstances as Colchester became the first club to have two goalkeepers sent off in the same fixture. The game against Hereford United on 16 October 1993 saw John Keeley sent off in the 43rd minute, the U's already 1\u20130 down from a Chris Pike goal. Roy McDonough covered in goal until half time, where he conceded another goal to Pike. Munson was brought on at half time but was sent off in the 68th minute after conceding to Chris Fry and Pike once again, giving him a hat-trick, scoring against three different goalkeepers in the same game. McDonough returned to goal following Munson's dismissal and conceded again, this time to Derek Hall in the 88th minute to result in a disastrous 5\u20130 loss."]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Derek Hall"]}]}}
