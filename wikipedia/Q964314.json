Later that year he moved to his home-town club, Derry City, where he won the League of Ireland Cup three times in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and the FAI Cup in 2006. At Derry, he gained the nickname \"The Derry Pel\u00e9\" for his skilful play. In 2008 he signed for Scottish Premier League club Celtic; the club he supported as a boy. In a five-season spell with Celtic, McCourt won the Scottish Cup in 2011 and 2013 and the SPL title in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313. Despite being a fan favourite at the club, he failed to gain a regular first-team place and was released in June 2013. McCourt then signed a one-year contract at Championship club Barnsley, though the club was relegated during the 2013\u201314 season and McCourt was released. He signed a one-year deal with Brighton & Hove Albion for the 2014\u201315 campaign, but featured little and joined League One club Notts County on loan for the final third of the season. He left Brighton and in July 2015 signed for League Two club Luton Town on a two-year contract. He was released by mutual consent one year into his contract to enable him to return to Northern Ireland and subsequently signed a one-year contract with NIFL Premiership club Glenavon. He left Glenavon in December 2016 after a mutual agreement to terminate his contract. In March 2017, McCourt was announced as having signed for League of Ireland side Finn Harps F.C..\nMcCourt made his Northern Ireland international debut in 2002, but did not play again until 2009. He scored his first two goals against the Faroe Islands in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "SuperCupNI", "response": ["* Paddy McCourt (County Londonderry) 2000 (U16), (Northern Ireland) 2002 (U19) "]}, {"page": "Derry City F.C.", "response": ["| Technical Director || Paddy McCourt"]}, {"page": "Glenavon F.C.", "response": ["Glenavon did not enjoy similar success in the 2016\u201317 season. Despite having signed former Celtic and Northern Ireland winger Paddy McCourt, the club struggled for form and could only achieve a disappointing 6th-placed finish in the league. Although the club reached the semi-finals of the Mid-Ulster Cup, League Cup and Irish Cup, they were defeated in all by Warrenpoint Town, Carrick Rangers and Coleraine respectively.

Three days later, he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu as Luton took Premier League club Stoke City to a penalty shoot-out in a League Cup second round fixture, only to lose 8\u20137 on penalties after the match ended 1\u20131 after extra-time. During a 2\u20131 home defeat to Plymouth Argyle on 24 October 2015, Hall received two yellow cards within a couple of minutes of each other and was subsequently sent off. However, this caused some confusion because it wasn't made clear in the aftermath of the first incident that Hall had been a shown a yellow card, thus he wasn't expecting a subsequent red card following the second incident. This led to an apology from the Football Association after Luton sought clarification from both them and the referee which determined that the referee did not make it clear who received the yellow card in the first incident, but Hall would still be suspended for the next fixture against Dagenham & Redbridge. Hall's next appearance was during a 4\u20133 home defeat to Northampton Town, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute for Sean Long, a result which led to the sacking of manager John Still. He featured twice under caretaker manager Andy Awford, in a 0\u20130 draw with Portsmouth on 28 December 2015, followed by a 2\u20130 away defeat to Bristol Rovers five days later. Hall also featured in the first match under new Luton manager Nathan Jones, a 0\u20130 draw with Cambridge United two weeks later, but went off with a foot injury after 65 minutes and was replaced by Paddy McCourt. He returned to the matchday squad for a home fixture against Hartlepool United on 20 February 2016, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Alex Lawless during a 2\u20131 win. However, a succession of injuries ruled him out for the rest of the season, after which Luton announced he would be released upon the expiry of his contract, a decision manager Nathan Jones described as 'logical' as a result of missing a significant amount of training and a lack of game time."]}, {"page": "Nathan Doyle", "response": ["Doyle played in the first four matches of 2015\u201316, but sustained a muscle injury in the latter, a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Bristol Rovers on 18 August 2015.

Doyle signed a further contract extension with Luton on 10 November to keep him at the club until the summer of 2018. He struggled with injuries in November and December, firstly sustaining an ankle injury in early November, followed by a knee injury in early December. The latter required a visit to a specialist and a subsequent operation, ruling him out for six weeks. Doyle returned to training in March 2016, but made no further appearances during the season. Doyle suffered an Achilles tendon rupture in his first pre-season training session prior to the 2016\u201317 season, resulting in a long spell on the sidelines.

On 24 January 2010, McGowan made an impressive display when he provided assists for both Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9 and Paddy McCourt, as Celtic made a comeback from 1\u20130 down to win 4\u20131 against St Johnstone."]}, {"page": "2007 League of Ireland Premier Division", "response": ["On 8 June 2007, it was announced that the FAI had teamed up with Electronic Arts and that the League of Ireland would feature in the FIFA 08 computer game; the first time for the league to feature in the FIFA series.\"Eircom League of Ireland to feature in FIFA 08\", eircomLOI.ie, 8 June 2007.
