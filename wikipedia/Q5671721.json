He made 25 Third Division North appearances in the 1937\u201338 season, as goalkeeping duties were split between himself and James Nicholls. However, he played just three Third Division South games in the 1938\u201339 season, as new signing Arthur Jepson became the club's first choice goalkeeper. Heppell was enlisted into the Army in February 1940. Despite this he managed to guest for Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough during World War II, before returning to Port Vale following his demobilization in January 1946. He was an ever-present during the 1946\u201347 season, as his form convinced the club to sell Jepson to rivals Stoke City. He remained Gordon Hodgson's first choice goalkeeper, playing 40 games in the 1947\u201348 campaign. He played 38 games in the 1948\u201349 season, ahead of reserves Ray Hancock and Harry Prince. However, he then lost his place, and played just three games in the 1949\u201350 season as new signing Ray King proved to be in impressive form. He featured 17 and 28 times in the 1950\u201351 and 1951\u201352 seasons, before being handed a free transfer away from Vale Park by new boss Freddie Steele in May 1952. He later played non-league football for Witton Albion."]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Over the Christmas period talk was dominated by 'The Wembley of the North', which had been projected as an 80,000 capacity stadium, now it was planned as a 40,000 capacity ground with room for future expansion. Finding just fifty members for the '100 club', the financing was helped by a \u00a38,000 grant from The Football Association. In January the club initiated a fire-sale of players: Bill Pointon went to Queens Park Rangers for a then-club record five-figure fee, whilst Harry Hubbick was sold to Rochdale for around \u00a31,000. Meanwhile, the club transfer listed Palk, Aveyard, and Eric Eastwood (who all lived outside North Staffordshire); whilst Hulligan returned from injury. A two-month run without a win followed, in which Hodgson again experimented with the first eleven. This run finally ended with a 1\u20130 win over Notts County on 9 April. Nine days later at Ashton Gate, keeper Harry Prince was given a chance in place of regular George Heppell, who embarrassed himself by attempting to punch a forty-yard punt from Stone, only to miss the ball entirely and thereby concede the equalizer. Later in the month, Hodgson signed George King from Hull City for a four-figure fee. King scored twice in his debut against Torquay United.", "They finished a disappointing thirteenth, boasting just 39 points. They had scored twelve fewer goals than the previous campaign, though their defensive record was identical. Harry Prince's move to Stafford Rangers was the only significant departure of the summer.", "|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Harry Prince", "| May 1949 || GK ||  || Harry Prince || Stafford Rangers || Released || "]}, {"page": "List of people from Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["*Harry Prince (born 1921), played for Port Vale."]}, {"page": "1944\u201345 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Harry Prince", "| August 1944 || GK ||  || Harry Prince || Wolverhampton Wanderers || Free transfer ||"]}, {"page": "1945\u201346 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Harry Prince"]}]}}
