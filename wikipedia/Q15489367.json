In such modern adaptations, Morgause is often conflated with (and into) the character of Morgan le Fay, who may be Mordred's mother or alternatively his lover or wife. A few works of the Middle Ages and today, however, portray Mordred as less a traitor and more a conflicted opportunist, or even a victim of fate.The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 394.

He was modeled in part on William Munny, the protagonist of Clint Eastwood's 1992 Western film, Unforgiven. The developers set out to craft an antihero to suit \"a game where the player is put in the position where everyone believes you are evil\", feeling that the industry required a story addressing issues of moral ambiguity and wondering how players would react when \"everyone in the world was your enemy (including yourself) [...] where you had to kill innocents to survive [and] you are the ultimate pawn\". Other influences which helped to define Kain's character arc included The Wheel of Time, Necroscope, and cover art from The Pillars of the Earth. In comparison to Count Dracula, Dyack commented in an interview that he believed Kain would \"kick his ass\" in a fight. He and writer Ken McCulloch considered Simon Templeman's voiceover for the character superlative, despite initial apprehensions that the actors they had hired might not be able to convey the game's complicated dialogue.", "Opinion on Kain's character has been largely positive in critical reviews of the Legacy of Kain games. Praise has frequently been directed towards Simon Templeman's voice acting, with IGN, Game Revolution and Adrenaline Vault citing Kain's soliloquies as \"both gruesome and entertaining\", \"the best part [of the game's audio]\" and \"one of the best stints of voice acting ever recorded\" respectively in their assessments of his debut in the original Blood Omen. For Blood Omen 2, although critics expressed disappointment with the game itself, they praised Kain's character nevertheless; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin branded him \"a very intriguing protagonist\" and \"as memorable of a main character as they come\", while IGN's Douglass C. Perry felt he was \"incredibly likeable\", and \"in a very true sense [...] a great videogame character\". GameZone's Michael Knutson opined that he was a \"wicked cool character\", and Game Revolution's Johnny Liu named him a \"great anti-hero\". Kasavin again praised him in a review for Defiance, writing that \"it's rare enough to find a truly memorable main character in a game, let alone two\", and that the game's ensemble cast \"[to some extent superseded] the problems in the gameplay\".

However, after the mysterious figure demonstrates his flying skills by taking the controls of the Sea Duck and evading an air pirate attack, Baloo becomes inclined to believe that the man really is Rick Sky. Baloo's belief, however, is later extinguished when Sky steals the Sea Duck in order to search for the missing silver so he can finish his squadron's mission to deliver it and restore the honor of his squadron.

Afterwards, they fly to some ice cliffs in search of the silver, but end up finding the rest of Sky's squadron frozen in ice. It is then made clear to Sky that he and his squadron froze into the cliffs during a snowstorm, preserving them alive in suspended animation so that they did not age, and preserving their planes in perfect working order. Two decades later, Sky thawed out and drifted out to sea, where he was rescued by Baloo at the beginning of the episode.
