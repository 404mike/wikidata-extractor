He was supported by the Courteeners and Plan B respectively. Terry Kirkbride and Gem Archer joined him on-stage, as did Jay Darlington, all of whom Gallagher had previously worked with while he was still a member of Oasis. He played a mostly acoustic set, and played a variety of Oasis album tracks and B-sides. It was almost the same set he played at the Royal Albert Hall in 2007. Gallagher also joined friend Paul Weller onstage in London on 21 April 2010, and played the Oasis song \"Mucky Fingers\" and a song he co-wrote with Weller, \"Echoes Round the Sun\"."]}, {"page": "Don't Believe the Truth", "response": ["* Terry Kirkbride\u00a0\u2013 drums and percussion (track 2)"]}, {"page": "Stop the Clocks (song)", "response": ["On 3 May 2003, Noel played the song in public for the first time at the Zanzibar club in Liverpool. Noel, fellow Oasis guitarist Gem Archer and part-time Oasis percussionist Terry Kirkbride played a five-song semi-acoustic set as a favour to The Bandits, who were headlining at the time.   A review passed on to NME said that the song was as a cross between \"The Hindu Times\" and \"Wonderwall\", similar to late George Harrison-penned Beatles. It features the lyric 'Stop the clocks and leave it all behind / On the backseat of my mind'. Another review, published at AngryApe, said that the song left the crowd \"divided and unsure\", adding that it was \"a fairly melancholic affair crossing \"Fade In-Out\" with \"Who Feels Love?\". It's classic Oasis but with more soul, fairly mature and well structured as opposed to 3 chord catchy pop songs.\" "]}, {"page": "The Sandkings (band)", "response": ["* Terry Kirkbride: drums, tambourine, backing vocals (1988-1992)"]}, {"page": "The Same Old Blues", "response": ["*Terry Kirkbride \u2013 drums, vocals, percussion"]}, {"page": "The Dreams We Have as Children \u2013 Live at the Royal Albert Hall", "response": ["*Terry Kirkbride \u2013 percussion"]}, {"page": "NaoKo TakaHashi", "response": ["Her film, Good Morning At Night (2005), has been shown at Nikolaj Copenhagen Contemporary Art Centre and 24th Uppsala International Short Film Festival.
