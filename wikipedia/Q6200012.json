There appear to be no records about this club. In 1879 Jimmy Douglas was signed by Renfrew Football Club. This Renfrew existed from 1875 until 1891. Douglas left Renfrew in 1880 and headed south to England. There he joined Barrow Rangers (not today's Barrow Rangers) but after a short stay joined Blackburn Rovers. Before leaving Renfrew, he got a call\u2013up from Scotland. Douglas played in an international friendly against Wales which Scotland won 5\u20131. However, as Douglas played in England he was never called\u2013up again.Jimmy Douglas was one of a triumvirate of Scottish professionals who provided the backbone of Blackburn Rovers' FA Cup success of the 1880s. To circumvent the rules on professionalism Douglas was found employment at Yate's Iron Foundry in the town and he quickly became a popular member of the club.\nHis enthusiastic approach to the game was noted by the correspondent of the Blackburn Times, in April 1882, when he wrote that Douglas 'is a bold player, and when fortune seems against the team becomes reckless of danger, dashing forward against any odds. He is an excellent wing player, and he and his partner understand each other perfectly. He divides with McIntyre the kicks from the right corner flag, and is frequently exceedingly successful in making them. In shooting at goal he is rather too apt to send the leather over the bar, but is, nevertheless, dangerous in front of goal, and is very valuable in a scrimmage'. His success was all the more remarkable because of his small build, but, in an era when brute force often triumphed over finesse, his Scot had sufficient skill to be able to make his mark on the game. When Douglas first joined Blackburn he operated on the right wing of a six\u2013man attack, but when the club adopted the five\u2013man front line he dropped back to right\u2013half. Indeed, his versatility was such that he was drafted into the pivotal centre\u2013half position on more than one occasion and was able to operate with supreme ease in this more demanding role.Jimmy Douglas played in the first of four FA Cup Finals at Kennington Oval on 25 March 1882, 1882 FA Cup Final, Blackburn Rovers became the first team to play in the FA Cup Final who were not based in the Home Counties or London. Blackburn Rovers lost 1\u20130 to Old Etonians and Douglas played as a forward. Jimmy Douglas played in the 1884 FA Cup Final when the opponents were Queen's Park Glasgow. Rovers won 2\u20131 and Douglas played on the wing. Douglas' third Final was on 4 April 1885 when again Blackburn Rovers faced Queen's Park Glasgow. Rovers won 2\u20130 and Douglas played as a forward. The 1886 FA Cup Final was an all\u2013English affair when on 3 April 1886 Blackburn Rovers drew 0\u20130 with West Bromwich Albion. Douglas played as a forward. The replay was the following week and Rovers won 2\u20130 with Douglas as a forward again.\nDouglas made his League debut on 15 September 1888, playing as a wing-half against Accrington at Leamington Road, then home of Blackburn Rovers. The match ended in a 5\u20135 draw. Douglas only missed one of the 21 League games played in season 1888\u201389, as Blackburn finished fourth. As a wing-half he played in a midfield that achieved big (three-League-goals-or-more) wins on seven separate occasions. Douglas appeared in the two 1888\u201389 FA Cup semi-final matches Blackburn played against Wolverhampton Wanderers, which Blackburn lost after a replay.At the end of his career, in 1892, Douglas had played 76 first\u2013class matches for Blackburn Rovers scoring eight goals. He played in 34 League matches and 42 FA Cup ties. All his goals were scored in FA Cup ties.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Douglas (surname)", "response": ["* Jimmy Douglass, American record producer", "* Jimmy Douglas (American soccer)", "* Jimmy Douglas (Canadian soccer) (born 1948)", "* Jimmy Douglas (Scottish footballer) (born 1859)"]}, {"page": "James Douglas", "response": ["* Jimmy Douglas (American soccer) (1898\u20131972), goalkeeper ", "* Jimmy Douglas (Canadian soccer) (born 1948), midfielder and coach", "* Jimmy Douglas (Scottish footballer) (1859\u20131919), Scottish international footballer"]}, {"page": "1882 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|FW || || Jimmy Douglas "]}, {"page": "1885 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|FW || Jimmy Douglas ||"]}, {"page": "1886 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|FW || Jimmy Douglas ||", "|FW || Jimmy Douglas ||"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["|Alex Latta, Jimmy Douglas own goal"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Douglas (footballer born 1859)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Douglas (Scottish footballer)"]}]}}
