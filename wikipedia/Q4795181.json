Morley wrote his report to Parliament by 31 July. Morley also summarised his findings under six headings, but admitted that only the first dealt with the causes of the explosion. His key findings were: the compulsory use of safety lamps in place of candles, the provision by the owners of the best type of safety lamps, banning smoking in the pit, greater care in the selection of underviewer and firemen, replacing direct furnace ventilation with dumb-drift ventilation of fans, and the \"taking of the ventilation on more frequent occasions with measurements of each of the main splits\". The fifth point expressed his concern that potentially explosive gases were drawn directly through the furnace. Using an induced draught or fans meant that there should be nothing to ignite escaping gases. The last point referred to measuring (\"taking\") the quantity of air both at the main downcast shaft and also at those points where the air current split to go to different districts. Morley drew attention to the question the coroner put and the jury's finding of \"no person is either criminally or censurably to blame\". Morley pointed out that this did not mean that there had been no management faults, merely that they did not meet the higher levels of culpability."]}, {"page": "Edward Tyas Cook", "response": ["In December 1895, Cook was approached by Arnold Morley about editing the Daily News.
