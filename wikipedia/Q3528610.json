He is known largely for his feats during the 1986/87 Ashes series where he hit three centuries in consecutive Tests, and for his fiery demeanour at the crease.\nBroad's children are both involved in cricket. His son Stuart is a fast bowler who, like his father, represents both England and  Nottinghamshire, while his daughter Gemma worked as a performance analyst with England's One-Day squad. Cricket correspondent Colin Bateman noted, \"Chris Broad pressed the self-destruct button on a career that promised so much.

Subsequent biomechanical tests conducted at the University of Western Australia in Perth showed that Muralitharan was straightening his arm by angles of up to 10 degrees prior to delivering doosras, well outside the International Cricket Council (ICC) acceptable guideline of 5 degrees for spin bowlers. (Straightening the bent arm at the moment of delivery imparts added ball speed due to the action of the triceps muscle: this is one of the ways baseball pitchers generate ball velocity.) Muralitharan was subsequently instructed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to bowl the doosra in international cricket. In November 2004, the International Cricket Council conducted more research into illegal bowling actions and found that many great bowlers like Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Shaun Pollock, whose actions were considered legitimate were actually transgressing the rules. A rule change was proposed and accepted at a meeting of ICC chief executives in early 2005, stating that any bowler may straighten the arm up to 15\u00b0 (which was earlier 9\u00b0 for spinners and 12\u00b0 for seamers) and Muralitharan's doosra once again became a legal delivery.", "The doosra of Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad, on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Mark Benson, and TV umpire Mahbubur Rahman after the second Test between India and Bangladesh at Chittagong in December 2004.
