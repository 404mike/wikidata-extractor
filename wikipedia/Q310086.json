In the film, the four Pevensie children return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in his struggle with the \"secret\" help of Aslan for the throne against his corrupt uncle, King Miraz.", "* Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian. Adamson said \"Caspian is a coming-of-age and, to some degree, a loss of innocence story, with Caspian starting out quite na\u00efve, then craving revenge and finally letting go of the vengeance.\" Andrew Garfield auditioned for the role but was turned down as he wasn't handsome enough. Nicholas Hoult also auditioned. While many readers interpret Caspian as a child, a passage in the novel mentions his age to be near that of Peter's, so an older actor was sought to match Moseley. Barnes had read the novel as a child, and was cast in two-and-a-half weeks after meeting with the filmmakers. He spent two months in New Zealand horse riding and stunt training to prepare for shooting. Barnes modelled his Spanish accent on Mandy Patinkin's performance as Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, though he also had a dialect coach aiding him. Adamson did not expect to cast a British actor as Caspian, and said Barnes fitted well into the surrogate family of Adamson and the four actors playing the Pevensies. When cast, Barnes was set to tour with the Royal National Theatre's production of The History Boys: producer Mark Johnson joked Barnes \"probably isn't the Nation's favourite actor right now\". Barnes left England without telling the Theatre. They were furious when they found out that he had left them without permission, so they considered suing him for breach of contract, but decided against it.", "On April 1, 2007, the crew began filming at Barrandov Studios in Prague. There, sets such as Miraz's castle, Aslan's How and the underground hiding places of the Narnians were created. The  castle was built to scale because Adamson felt he overused digital sets on the last film. The castle was built in the open air during winter, where the temperature would drop to . Miraz's courtyard is the largest set in production designer Roger Ford's career, including the previous Narnia film. Aslan's How was modified into the hideout after filming for those scenes was finished. To create Trufflehunter's den, Ford's crew put a camera inside a badger's den to study what it should look like. The den's roof had to be raised by three inches because Ben Barnes was too tall.Audio commentary with Andrew Adamson, Ben Barnes, William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley, 2008 DVD by Walt Disney Home Entertainment", "|Choice Movie: Male Breakout Star (Ben Barnes)", "|Best Performance \u2013 Male (Ben Barnes)", "|Breakthrough Male Performance (Ben Barnes)"]}, {"page": "Anna Popplewell", "response": ["Her first major role was in the film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) where she played Susan Pevensie at the age of 15.
