He previously became well known as Bill Boazman on the folk club circuit and at college gigs during the 1970s as a singer, songwriter and acoustic guitarist. He has been credited with accompanying J. J. Cale, but this is a fallacy arising from a typographic error involving an American musician with a similar name, Bob Brozman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yateley", "response": ["*Sonny Black a leading UK acoustic guitarist also lives in Yateley."]}, {"page": "Sonny", "response": ["* Sonny Black, English singer/songwriter born William Boazman", "* Dominick Napolitano, also known as Sonny Black (1930\u20131981), Capo in the Bonanno crime family"]}, {"page": "Bill Boazman", "response": ["#redirectSonny Black"]}, {"page": "Bill Bozeman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sonny Black"]}, {"page": "Free Spirit Records", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sonny Black"]}, {"page": "The Filth (album)", "response": ["The Filth is the first album by the noted British blues band, Sonny Black's Blues Band, fronted by songwriter, guitarist and singer Bill Boazman.
