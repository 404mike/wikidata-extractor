He passed the exam and became an advocate. He practised for over a decade, during which time he spent no more than a month every year with Johnson. Nevertheless, he returned to London annually to mingle with Johnson and the rest of the London literary crowd, and to escape his mundane existence in Scotland. He found enjoyment in playing the intellectual rhyming game crambo with his peers.", "Some of his journal entries and letters from this period describe his amatory exploits. Thus, in 1767, in a letter to William Johnson Temple, he wrote, \"I got myself quite intoxicated, went to a Bawdy-house and past a whole night in the arms of a Whore. She indeed was a fine strong spirited Girl, a Whore worthy of Boswell if Boswell must have a whore.\" A few years earlier, he wrote that during a night with an actress named Louisa, \"five times was I fairly lost in supreme rapture. Louisa was madly fond of me; she declared I was a prodigy and asked me if this was not extraordinary for human nature.\" Though he sometimes used a condom for protection, he contracted venereal disease at least seventeen times."]}, {"page": "Frederick Temple", "response": ["Temple's grandfather was William Johnson Temple, Rector of Mamhead in Devon, who is mentioned several times in James Boswell's Life of Johnson."]}, {"page": "William Temple", "response": ["* William Johnson Temple (1739\u20131796), English cleric and essayist, a correspondent of James Boswell"]}, {"page": "Christopher Wyvill", "response": ["A committee under Wyvill was appointed to continue the pressure by correspondence, and the example of Yorkshire was followed by other counties, 25 in all.

Temple and Boswell had been undergraduates together at the University of Edinburgh, and Boswell visited Mamhead just after Easter, 1775. Temple was a water-drinker, and under his influence Boswell made a vow (not kept) under the branches of the great churchyard yew at Mamhead (which can still be seen) never to get drunk again.Naylor, Robert, From John O'Groats to Land's End, page 34 of 42 at ebooksread.com, accessed 19 July 2008"]}, {"page": "William Johnstone Temple", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Johnson Temple"]}, {"page": "William Johnston Temple", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Johnson Temple"]}]}}
