Each chapter of the book has a main poetic title, and then a subtitle which refers to the aspect of scattering theory highlighted in that chapter.

There are 110 currently known interstellar molecules. These molecules have large numbers of observable transitions. Lines may also be observed in absorption\u2014for example the highly redshifted lines seen against the gravitationally lensed quasar PKS1830-211. High energy radiation, such as ultraviolet light, can break the molecular bonds which hold atoms in molecules. In general then, molecules are found in cool astrophysical environments. The most massive objects in our galaxy are giant clouds of molecules and dust known as giant molecular clouds. In these clouds, and smaller versions of them, stars and planets are formed. One of the primary fields of study of molecular astrophysics is star and planet formation. Molecules may be found in many environments, however, from stellar atmospheres to those of planetary satellites. Most of these locations are relatively cool, and molecular emission is most easily studied via photons emitted when the molecules make transitions between low rotational energy states. One molecule, composed of the abundant carbon and oxygen atoms, and very stable against dissociation into atoms, is carbon monoxide (CO). The wavelength of the photon emitted when the CO molecule falls from its lowest excited state to its zero energy, or ground, state is 2.6mm, or 115 gigahertz. This frequency is a thousand times higher than typical FM radio frequencies. At these high frequencies, molecules in the Earth's atmosphere can block transmissions from space, and telescopes must be located in dry (water is an important atmospheric blocker), high sites. Radio telescopes must have very accurate surfaces to produce high fidelity images.", "* Alexander Dalgarno (physicist)", "*Molecular Astrophysics: A volume honouring Alexander Dalgarno"]}, {"page": "Southgate School", "response": ["* Alexander Dalgarno, Phillips Professor of Astronomy at Harvard University since 1977 "]}, {"page": "Davisson\u2013Germer Prize in Atomic or Surface Physics", "response": ["* 1980: Alexander Dalgarno"]}, {"page": "Alex Dalgarno", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Dalgarno"]}, {"page": "Dalgarno", "response": ["*Alexander Dalgarno (1928\u20132015), physicist and astronomer"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Alexander Dalgarno||16/03/1972||"]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (A)", "response": ["*Alexander Dalgarno"]}, {"page": "John T.
