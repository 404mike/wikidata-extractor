Hillgruber claimed that irrational anti-German prejudices said to be rampant within the British elite drove British policy, and that what happened to Germany in 1945 was merely the culmination of a long-term British policy to destroy Germany as a nation, which every British government had pursued since 1907.

Hillgruber accused the British of holding to \"a negative image of Prussia, exaggerated to the point of becoming a myth\", which led them to seek the utter destruction of the Prussian-German state in World War II, and blinded them to the fact that a strong Central European state led by Prussia was the only thing that prevented the \"flooding\" of Central Europe by the Red Army. In this way, Hillgruber argued \"that the amputation of the Reich in favor of a greater Poland was a war aim of the Allies long before Auschwitz\", and asserted that the loss of the German eastern territories was due to anti-German prejudices.Rabinbach, Anson, \"The Jewish Question in the German Question\", pp. 45-73 in Baldwin, Peter (ed.), Reworking the Past, Boston: Beacon Press, 1990, p. 64.

The decision reached was that when a Greek witness and Turkish witness disagreed, a European witness would be used to provide the conclusions for the report. This system was dismissed by Venizelos because he claimed that the Europeans living in Smyrna benefited from privileges given to them under the Ottoman rule and were thus opposed to Greek rule. The report was released to negotiators in October and generally found Greeks responsible for the bloodshed related to the landing and the violence throughout the Smyrna zone after the landing. In addition, the conclusions questioned the fundamental justification for the Greek occupation and suggested Greek troops be replaced by an allied force.
