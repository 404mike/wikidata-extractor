P. Scott, but two names came to the fore: J. Batty Langley and Charles Hobson.  Hobson, the leader of the Sheffield Federated Trades Council, was a President of the Labour Electoral Association and would have stood as a Liberal-Labour candidate.  Local Liberal leaders hoped that, if he were selected, it would discourage more radical labour movement activists from standing their own candidate.  Langley ran a large saw mill in the city, and was an alderman on Sheffield Town Council.
