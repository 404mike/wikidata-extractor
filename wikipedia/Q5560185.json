He was the nephew of Aaron Arrowsmith, the English cartographer.\nIn 1810 he joined his uncle in the cartography business. After his uncle died in 1823, the family firm was carried on by his sons Aaron and Samuel Arrowsmith, and John began working on his own. The Arrowsmiths were founding members of the Geographical Society of London in 1830. The junior Aaron left the family firm in 1832, and upon the death of Samuel in 1839, John merged it into his own successful business. In 1863 he received the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, which was what the Geographical Society of London was known after gaining the patronage of King William IV.\nArrowsmith spent the years after his uncle's death preparing maps for his iconic London Atlas of Universal Geography, the first edition of which was published in 1834 with 50 maps. He published subsequent editions, adding and removing maps until there were 72 plates in one late edition.  The atlas continued to be published after his death, the rights to publish the maps being acquired by Edward Stanford in 1874.\nMount Arrowsmith, situated east of Port Alberni on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, is named for John Arrowsmith and his uncle Aaron Arrowsmith. The Arrowsmith River in Western Australia was named by Sir George Grey after Arrowsmith, who later produced the maps for the published journals of Grey's two Western Australian expeditions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of cartographers", "response": ["*John Arrowsmith (England, 1790\u20131873), member of the Arrowsmith family of geographers"]}, {"page": "Cape of Good Hope", "response": ["* Cape of Good Hope is a map by John Arrowsmith in 1842"]}, {"page": "Ludwig Leichhardt", "response": ["A detailed map of Ludwig Leichhardt's route in Australia from Moreton Bay to Port Essington (1844 & 1845), from his Original Map, adjusted and drawn... by John Arrowsmith was ranked #8  in the \u2018Top 150: Documenting Queensland\u2019 exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010.
