A quote by the show organizers stated, \"Through the use of associative thinking, non-scientific causal reasoning, symbolic expression, metaphor, metonym, and synchronicity the goal of artist and magician are the same seeking to affect change in the world. With this show we seek a synchronicity that will dissolve distinctions and help us to shed light on the dark and dark on the light. By looking at the production of art through much older means, we may discover new ways of experiencing and understanding its role.\" In 2014 Simonsen exhibited drawings for the Bellevue Arts Museum: BAM Biennial: Knock on Wood. These works responded to a large collection of his family's turn-of-the-century photographs of the Pacific Northwest's logging and railroad industries.
