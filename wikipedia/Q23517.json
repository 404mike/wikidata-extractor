This \"sharp-eyed\" satire continued in his mature work, commenting on the cult of celebrity, the machinery of 'fame', and \"the dilemma of being true to oneself while also fitting into polite society\". Stephen Dalton in The Hollywood Reporter wrote, Lewis had \"an agreeably bitter streak, offering self-lacerating insights into celebrity culture which now look strikingly modern.
