Wild had just returned from Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition. To captain Endurance Shackleton had wanted John King Davis, who had commanded Aurora during the Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Davis refused, thinking the enterprise was \"foredoomed\", so the appointment went to Frank Worsley, who claimed to have applied to the expedition after learning of it in a dream.Huntford 1975, pp.\u00a0364\u2013365.

Two Nimrod veterans were assigned to the Ross Sea party: Mackintosh, who commanded it, and Ernest Joyce. Shackleton had hoped that Aurora would be staffed by a naval crew, and had asked the Admiralty for officers and men, but was turned down.Huntford 1975, pp.\u00a0370\u2013371.

Vincent was originally taken on as the bosun, but after a row with Thomas Orde-Lees and complaints of bullying from members of the fo'c'sle crew, he was called to Shackleton's cabin and demoted to Able Seaman. He did not cause any further trouble, but Shackleton kept a watchful eye on him: after the Endurance was crushed by the ice and the men were forced to use the three small lifeboats to reach Elephant Island, Shackleton made sure that Vincent was among the men in his boat. He also chose him as part of the six-man crew of the James Caird who were to sail to South Georgia to fetch help. Though some sources say Shackleton didn't want to leave him on the island where he could spread dissent, this contradicts Shackleton's own feelings about needing a strong crew to navigate to South Georgia, and Vincent was noted as the fittest man on arriving at Elephant Island.  Vincent and Harry McNish were pitched into the water as the boat was launched, and Vincent's refusal to exchange his jersey led to unkind comments among the beach party that he had some of their possessions concealed about his person, though this also has conflicting reports.   Although Vincent was the strongest man in the crew, he fared badly during the voyage to South Georgia: he was almost washed overboard, when chipping ice that had accumulated on the Caird,  only just grabbing the main mast in time. Shackleton recorded that two of the crew, Vincent and McNish, were very close to death, and although McNish showed \"grit and spirit\", Vincent ceased to be an active member of the crew, because he had become so ill."]}]}}
