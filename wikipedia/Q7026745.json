Brooks sold-out venues such as Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre and London's Wembley Arena, a feat never accomplished by an American country music artist. He also began the London radio station, Country 1035. Despite the disdain of the British media, Brooks' overall popularity in the country was evident, with a top disc jockey, Nick Barraclough, referring to Brooks as Garth Vader (a play on Darth Vader) for his \"invasion\" of the charts and his success in the country genre. Unlike Alan Jackson, who refused to return to the UK after being treated in a similar negative manner by the press, Brooks would later return in 1996 for more performances.

Their music has roots in bluegrass, jazz and swing, plus original numbers with a style reminiscent of the \"lazy swing\" of Dan Hicks, and has been described as \"sort of Americana, swingy, bluesy stuff with bags of harmony and whizzy playing\"; their theme song, \"Telephone Bill\", being a re-write/extension of the Peter Rowan song \"Panama Red\" (originally written for the band New Riders of the Purple Sage). In their initial incarnation they toured widely, performed on UK television and BBC radio, and recorded 3 albums on the Swamp, Smooth and Dingle's record labels. In 2001 they re-formed to play at that year's Cambridge Folk Festival and meanwhile, also played gigs and released one album as \"Nick Barraclough and the Burglars\" (alias the \"Burglars of Barcelona\").
