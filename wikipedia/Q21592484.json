Arriving in Hong Kong in 1842 it formed part of the 1st Brigade,  commanded by Major General Lord Saltoun, along with the 26th Foot, the Bengal Volunteer Battalion and the grenadier and light companies of the 41st Madras Native Infantry. The brigade advanced on Chinkiang and after an ineffective pursuit of retreating Chinese forces took part in the final advance on Nanking. During this war very few battle casualties were taken but over 50 died from cholera with another over 200 unfit for duty. As a result of its participation in the war, the regiment was awarded its first battle honour \"The DRAGON superscribed CHINA\". A move to Hong Kong followed where the appalling death rate from disease continued with over 500 dying and sick. This loss of life affected the 98th's commander, Sir Colin Campbell; his biographer, Adrian Greenwood, argues that Campbell was suffering from manic depression at the time."]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people with PPE degrees", "response": ["* Adrian Greenwood, historian and art dealer"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Murder victims", "response": [":Category:Murdered scholars and academics: Ismail al-Faruqi, John Holmes Jenkins, Adrian Greenwood, David Rattray, Nicolae Iorga. \u2014 \u00a0Ark25\u00a0 (talk) 20:24, 10 December 2016 (UTC)"]}, {"page": "The Hawthorns School", "response": ["* Adrian Greenwood, historian"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Adrian Greenwood, 42, art dealer and author."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2016", "response": ["*Adrian Greenwood, 42, British art dealer and author, stabbed.Historian Adrian Greenwood found murdered at his home"]}]}}
