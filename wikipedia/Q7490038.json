The theme music did not play over the end credits of episode 4, and was replaced with the song Amazing Grace, performed by Sharon Duncan-Brewster (Crystal Gordon). In 2000, Kath Gotts became the credited composer for the remaining duration of the series, resulting in a major revamp of the incidental music score, the recap music and newly established theme music, introduced for the second series. As with the first series, the theme music played over the end credits in Series 2 as the 5-second opening title contained only short instrumental music. For the third series a new 20-second opening sequence was introduced which contained various shots of G-wing, and a second version of the theme music was created by Gotts so that the series could be recognized as having official opening titles. Towards the end of the third series, a third and final version of the theme music was placed over the opening sequence, which slightly differed from the previous music, and remained as such for the show's duration. In 2002, a soundtrack CD was released as part of the original Series 3 DVD, featuring the music score from the third series and including both opening and closing theme music, recap music, and \"next time\" music, as well as the incidental music. The soundtrack is currently unavailable as the DVD set is now out-of-print.
