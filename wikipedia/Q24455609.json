They had finished top of a group that, like Bristol's, had contained three second division teams. At the time of the match, Aston Villa were 11th in the WSL having taken six points from eight games, four points ahead of Bristol. Despite missing three key first-team players; goalkeeper Sophie Baggaley and midfielder Carla Humphrey who were positive for COVID-19 and defender Jemma Purfield who was deemed a close contact, Bristol put in one of their most resilient performances of the season. After a goalless first half, Ebony Salmon broke the deadlock against her former club with two breakaway goals before the hour mark. Aston Villa's persistence eventually paid off as substitute Stine Larsen found a way past Benedicte H\u00e5land, the stand-in goalkeeper making her first appearance for the club, in the 86th-minute but it was too little too late as the hosts hung on for a 2\u20131 win. In the semi-final, Bristol faced Championship leaders Leicester City who had turned professional during the offseason and were in the knockout stage of the League Cup for the first time. Bristol City, in their third week of interim management under Matt Beard after Tanya Oxtoby had stepped down to take maternity leave, came into the game off the back of their first WSL win of the season, a convincing 3\u20130 victory over fellow strugglers Brighton & Hove Albion. A tightly-contested match, Bristol edged past their lower league opposition 1\u20130 courtesy of a first senior career goal for Kiera Skeels who had joined the club on loan from Reading six days earlier.", "|MF ||8|| Carla Humphrey   ||            || "]}]}}
