Tolkien, evaluates the paintings of Minas Tirith made by the major Tolkien illustrators Alan Lee, John Howe (both of whom worked as conceptual designers for Peter Jackson's film trilogy), Jef Murray, and Ted Nasmith. Tuthill writes that it has become \"hard to imagine\" Middle-earth \"without the many sub-creators who have worked within it\", noting that the \"dreaded effects\" of what Tolkien called \"silliness and morbidity\" of much fantasy art in his time \"are nowhere in evidence\" in these artists' work. In Tuthill's view, the most \"fully rendered and realistic-looking\" painting is Nasmith's Gandalf Rides to Minas Tirith, with a \"wholly convincing city\" in the background, majestic as the Wizard gallops towards it in the dawn light. He notes that Nasmith uses his architectural rendering skill to provide a detailed view of the whole city. He quotes Nasmith as writing that he studied what Tolkien said, such as likening Gondor to the culture of ancient Egypt. Tuthill compares Howe's and Murray's versions of the same scene; Howe shows only a corner of the city, but vividly captures the movement of the horse and the rider's flying robes, with a strong interplay of light and dark, the white horse against the dusky rocks. Howe similarly uses strong contrast, with the white city against dark clouds overhead, but using \"flat bold lines and a deep blue hue\", while Howe's city more closely resembles a traditional castle of fairytales with pennants on every pinnacle, in Fauvist style. Lee chooses instead to look Within Minas Tirith, showing \"the same glimmering spires and white stone\", a guard standing in the foreground in place of Gandalf and his horse; his painting gives a feeling of \"how massive the city is\", with close attention to the late Romanesque or early Gothic architectural detail and perspective."]}, {"page": "Works inspired by J.
