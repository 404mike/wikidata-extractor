He was a member of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1912 to 1918, representing the United Labor Party (1912-1917) and the National Party (1917-1918). He served as the Attorney-General of South Australia from 1915 to 1917.In the 1917 Labor split, Vaughan was expelled along with his brother, Premier Crawford Vaughan, and joined the new National Party. Upon the defeat of the Vaughan ministry in July 1917, Vaughan did not nominate for a position in the new coalition ministry of Archibald Peake, and enlisted to serve in World War I. He was controversially opposed at the 1918 election while away on active service, and being unable to campaign was defeated by Labor candidate Tom Gluyas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crawford Vaughan", "response": ["Vaughan and Labor defeated the Liberal Union government led by Archibald Peake at the 1915 election, with 26 of 46 seats in the House of Assembly. At the time, he was the youngest Premier in Australia at the age of 40. His brother, John Vaughan, became his Attorney-General. His government improved the education system by restructuring the department's senior bureaucracy, by extending the years of compulsory school attendance and by providing better facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled. The government legislated to allow women to serve in the police force and as justices of the peace, while it also improved workers' access to the arbitration system and diminished the court's punitive powers against trade unions. A wheat pool was created, as were land and housing schemes for war veterans. However, the government also passed a law designed to close Lutheran primary schools."]}, {"page": "John Vaughan", "response": ["John Vaughan may refer to:", "*John Vaughan, 1st Earl of Carbery (1574/75\u20131634), Welsh courtier and MP for Carmarthenshire 1601, 1621", "*John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Carbery (1639\u20131713), Governor of Jamaica and President of the Royal Society, MP for Carmarthen 1661 and Carmarthenshire 1679\u201386", "*John Vaughan, 1st Viscount Lisburne (1667\u20131721)", "*John Vaughan, 2nd Viscount Lisburne (1695\u20131741), MP for Cardiganshire 1727\u201334", "*John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Lisburne (1769\u20131831), MP for Cardigan 1796\u20131818", "*Sir John Vaughan (puisne judge) (1768\u20131839), baron of the Exchequer and justice of the Common Pleas", "*John Vaughan, 8th Earl of Lisburne (1918\u20132014)", "*Sir John Vaughan (d.1643), army officer and military governor of Derry 1611\u20131643, and MP for County Donegal in 1613 and 1634", "*John Vaughan (British Army officer, born 1871) (1871\u20131956), British cavalry officer commanded the 3rd Cavalry Division in the First World War", "*Sir John Vaughan (British Army officer, died 1795) (c. 1731\u20131795), British army officer and Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed 1774\u201395", "*John Vaughan (East India Company officer) (1778\u20131830), British East India Company army officer", "*John Vaughan (died 1577), MP for Herefordshire, Horsham, Surrey, Petersfield, Bletchingley, Hedon, Northumberland, Dartmouth and Grantham", "*John Vaughan (died 1574), MP for Carmarthen Boroughs, 1558 and Carmarthenshire, 1572 ", "*John Vaughan (by 1553-97 or later), MP for Pembroke 1594, 1586", "*Sir John Vaughan (chief justice) (1603\u20131674), MP for Cardigan 1628\u201345 and Cardiganshire 1661\u201368, Chief Justice of Common Pleas", "*John Vaughan (MP for Montgomery) (c. 1654\u2013c. 1713), MP for Montgomery 1701\u201305", "*John Vaughan (1693\u20131765), MP for Carmarthenshire 1745\u201354", "*John Vaughan (died 1804) (c. 1752\u20131804) of Golden Grove, Carmarthenshire, MP for Carmarthenshire, 1779\u20131804", "*John Vaughan (Australian politician) (1879\u20131955), Attorney-General of South Australia", "*John Vaughan (ironmaster) (1799\u20131868), 19th century British ironmaster and mayor of Middlesbrough", "* John Vaughan (MP for Merioneth), Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1654", "*John Vaughan (footballer, born 1856) (1856\u20131935), Welsh international footballer", "*John Vaughan (cricketer) (born 1945), Canadian cricketer", "*John Vaughan (footballer, born 1964), English football goalkeeper with Fulham, Cambridge United, Preston North End, Lincoln City and others", "*John Vaughan (wine merchant) (1756\u20131841), treasurer and librarian of the American Philosophical Society", "*John Vaughan (architect), American architect active in 1891 in Salt Lake City, Utah", "*John Vaughan (plant scientist) (1926\u20132005), British food scientist", "*John Vaughan (bishop) (1853\u20131925), English Catholic bishop", "*John Vaughan (Canon of Windsor) (died 1499), Canon of Windsor", "*John Vaughan (naturalist) (1855\u20131922), Canon of Winchester, Rector of Droxford and naturalist"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1906 Australian federal election", "response": ["|Wakefield || Independent || || || John Vaughan || |Sir Frederick Holder"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1910 Australian federal election", "response": ["|Wakefield || Liberal || John Vaughan || |Richard Foster || Charles Horne (YANP)"]}, {"page": "Attorney-General of South Australia", "response": ["| 32 || data-sort-value=\"Vaughan\" | John Vaughan || United Labor/Nationals || 3 April 1915 || 14 July 1917 ||"]}, {"page": "John Howard Vaughan", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Vaughan (Australian politician)"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1912\u20131915", "response": ["|| John Vaughan || Central || Labor || 1912\u20131918"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian Legislative Council, 1915\u20131918", "response": ["|| John Vaughan || Central No. 1 || Labor/National  || 1918 || 1912\u20131918", ": In the February 1917 Labor split, the official Labor Party expelled Premier Crawford Vaughan and his supporters, including three of their MLCs, William Humphrey Harvey, Alfred William Styles and John Vaughan, over their support for conscription in World War I.
