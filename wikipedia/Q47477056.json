He was a board director of construction and services business Carillion from April 2007 to December 2016. After the company went into liquidation in January 2018, Adam was criticised by a Parliamentary select committees report, and the Financial Reporting Council and other regulators started investigations into his conduct.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carillion", "response": ["The report said Carillion's collapse had significant consequences, citing: over 2,000 job losses; a pension liability of around \u00a32.6 billion reducing payments to 27,000 pension scheme members; debts owed to 30,000 suppliers, sub-contractors and other creditors; and \u00a3150m in UK Government expenditure to keep essential public services running. Former directors Philip Green, Richard Adam and Richard Howson were singled out for particular criticism. The select committee chairs (Frank Field and Rachel Reeves) called for a complete overhaul of Britain's corporate governance regime, saying the government had \"lacked the decisiveness or bravery\" to do so, and accused the big four accounting firms of operating as a \"cosy club\", with KPMG singled out for its \"complicity\" in signing off Carillion's \"increasingly fantastical figures\" and internal auditor Deloitte accused of failing to identify, or ignoring, \"terminal failings\". The report recommended the Government refer the statutory audit market to the Competition and Markets Authority, urging consideration of breaking up the Big Four, while two regulators, the Financial Reporting Council and The Pensions Regulator, were branded as \"chronically passive\".", "On 29 January 2018, it was reported that Carillion's auditor KPMG would have its role examined by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). In March 2018, the FRC's conduct committee announced an additional investigation into the conduct of former Carillion finance directors Richard Adam and Zafar Khan (both members of the ICAEW), focusing on the preparation and approval of Carillion's financial reports for 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the six months to 30 June 2017, as well as provision of other financial information from 2014 to 2017. Initial interviews had been undertaken by May 2018, with more to follow; tens of thousands of documents were to be reviewed as part of the FRC's investigation looking at 'contract accounting', 'reverse factoring', 'pensions', and 'good and going concern'. The FRC investigation was later extended to review earlier Carillion reporting in 2013. In November 2019, the FRC gave an update on the progress of four investigations (two concerning auditing, two relating to possible director misconduct). A decision on enforcement action on auditing matters would be made before the end of 2019, it said, while a decision on directors' conduct would be taken by March 2020. In January 2020, the FRC said the scale and complexity of the investigations meant publication of its first report would be delayed to summer 2020. The FRC's first report, which found a number of breaches, was delivered to KPMG in September 2020; the FRC was awaiting a KPMG response before deciding whether to take enforcement action. In March 2021, KPMG was reported to be \"inching towards a financial settlement with regulators\" over its auditing of Carillion, with the FRC expected to impose a record fine, possibly around \u00a325m, on KPMG for its failings.", "In June 2018, it was reported that KPMG and Carillion bosses had maintained a \u00a3329m valuation of goodwill relating to the former Eaga business (later Carillion Energy Services), despite huge losses. Ignoring the impairment meant they could continue to pay dividends and directors' bonuses, including \u00a31.8m each paid to Richard Howson and Richard Adam.", "In addition to its initial investigation into the timeliness and content of Carillion's financial announcements, the Financial Conduct Authority said its investigation would extend to allegations of insider trading in Carillion shares prior to its trading update on 10 July 2017. In November 2020, the FCA said some Carillion directors had \"acted recklessly\" and released \"misleadingly positive\" market updates before it collapsed, singling out updates issued on 7 December 2016, 1 March 2017 and 3 May 2017. As a result, the FCA said it had sent notices to some (unnamed) former Carillion directors warning of possible enforcement action (possible sanctions include public censure, fines and suspensions from holding certain positions). In January 2021, the Insolvency Service said it would seek to ban eight former Carillion directors from holding senior boardroom positions, namely: Philip Green, Richard Howson, Keith Cochrane, Richard Adam and Zafar Khan, and non-executive directors Andrew Dougal, Alison Horner and Ceri Powell.", "*Richard Adam (finance director, appointed April 2007, resigned 31 December 2016)*"]}, {"page": "Financial Reporting Council", "response": ["Following the January 2018 collapse of construction and services business Carillion, it was reported that Carillion's auditor KPMG would have its role examined by the FRC.
