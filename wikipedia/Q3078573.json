During this period, he wrote most of the poetry that would become D\u00e0in do Eimhir, including the epic An Cuilthionn. MacLean cultivated friendships with Scottish Renaissance poets, including MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, Norman MacCaig, Douglas Young, and George Campbell Hay. MacLean, also a noted historian, published two influential papers on nineteenth-century Gaelic poetry in Transactions of the  in 1938 and 1939, which challenged the Celtic Twilight view of Gaelic literature. MacLean accused the \"Celtic Twilightists\" with \"attributing to Gaelic poetry the very opposite of every quality which it actually has\", at which they only succeeded because they catered to a credulous English-speaking audience. He pointed out that the apparent sentimentality or impotence of the corpus of Clearance poetry may have been an artefact of the fact that landlords would not have preserved poetry critical of them. His use of Gaelic poetry as a potential source material for historical studies was extremely innovative at the time.", "From the early 1970s, MacLean was in demand internationally as a reader of his own poetry. He would start a reading of a poem by describing the images, then read the poem first in Gaelic and again in English, emphasizing that the translations were not to be read as poems in themselves. His readings were described as deeply moving even by listeners who did not speak Gaelic; according to Seamus Heaney, \"MacLean's voice had a certain bardic weirdness that sounded both stricken and enraptured\". Gaelic poet George Campbell Hay wrote in a review that MacLean \"is gifted with what the Welsh call Hwyl, the power of elevated declamation, and his declamation is full of feeling.\" These readings helped establish his international reputation as a poet. MacLean's poetry was also translated into German, and he was invited to poetry readings in Germany and Austria."]}, {"page": "Elderslie", "response": ["*George Campbell Hay (1915\u20131984) \u2013 Writer"]}, {"page": "Modern Scottish Poetry", "response": ["Margot Robert Adamson - Marion Angus - George Bruce - Helen B.
