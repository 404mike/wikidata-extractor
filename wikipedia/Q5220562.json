It was a closely fought match in which Carlisle United matched Everton for much of the match. James Vaughan scored the opening tally against the run of play in the twelfth minute, but Carlisle's Kevan Hurst equalised only six minutes later. Carlisle nearly took the lead in the seventieth minute, but the Danny Livesey attempt was partially saved by Tim Howard and rang the crossbar. Everton were finally able to take hold of the match in the eight-second minute when Phil Neville knocked in the winner. Leighton Baines sealed the match with a penalty shot that had been earned by substitute Kieran Agard in the fifth minute of extra time. For the Fourth Round, Everton were drawn to face Birmingham City, who won their third round replay with Nottingham Forest. Everton were unable to duplicate the FA Cup run of the previous season as they were eliminated by Birmingham City, 2\u20131, in front of their home crowd at Goodison Park. Christian Ben\u00edtez opened the scoring for Birmingham in the seventh minute, and Barry Ferguson doubled the lead in the 40th minute. Leon Osman added a goal for Everton, but for the Toffees, it was too little too late."]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["*  Danny Livesey -  Carlisle United, month loan, 25 December", "*  Danny Livesey -  Carlisle United, free, 25 January"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Danny Livesey"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| Danny Livesey"]}, {"page": "2006 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|CB ||5||Danny Livesey"]}, {"page": "2011 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|DF ||5 || Danny Livesey"]}, {"page": "List of Bolton Wanderers F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["Danny Livesey.png|Danny Livesey"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["|rowspan=\"5\"|10||DF || ||5 ||Danny Livesey || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|5 || ||DF ||Danny Livesey || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 4 || 0"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["||DF || ||5 ||Danny Livesey || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3", "|5 || ||DF ||Danny Livesey || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 0"]}]}}
