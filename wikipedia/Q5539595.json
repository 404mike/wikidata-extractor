This is contradicted by multiple dialogue references throughout the programme (particularly in The Three Doctors, Mawdryn Undead and The Five Doctors) as well as the fact that the Doctor has regenerated nine times since then (as confirmed in \"The Time of the Doctor\"). Producer Philip Hinchcliffe has said, \"We tried to get famous actors for the faces of the Doctor. But because no one would volunteer, we had to use backroom boys. And it is true to say that I attempted to imply that William Hartnell was not the first Doctor.\" The Doctor's previous incarnations are represented by images of production unit manager George Gallaccio, script editor Robert Holmes, production assistant Graeme Harper, director Douglas Camfield, producer Philip Hinchcliffe, production assistant Christopher Baker, writer Robert Banks Stewart and director Christopher Barry.. This inconsistency was later explained in the episode \"The Timeless Children\", with the Doctor having had many previous incarnations before Hartnell's, however, the Doctor's memories of these had been erased by the secret Time Lord organization known as the Division.
