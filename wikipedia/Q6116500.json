He played as a right back.Marsh began his career with his local club Stoke City making his debut in 1967. He soon became a member of Tony Waddington's first team in the 1970s as Stoke enjoyed their most successful period in their history. March played in the 1972 Football League Cup Final as Stoke beat Chelsea 2\u20131 to claim their first major honour. He also played for the club the UEFA Cup. In total Marsh made 440 appearances for Stoke in 12 seasons he spent at the Victoria Ground.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["Smith established himself in the Stoke defence in 1969\u201370, forming a centre-back partnership with Alan Bloor in between full backs Jackie Marsh and Mike Pejic. Smith was the aggressive and highly physical defender, complimented by Bloor who tended to stay further back and use his intelligence to read the game and clean up any mistakes Smith made. Smith claimed his first goal for the club on 17 September 1969, in a 3\u20131 win over West Bromwich Albion (West Brom) at the Hawthorns. Stoke reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1970\u201371, and Smith played in the fourth round victory over Huddersfield Town despite suffering from a fractured ankle. He scored the only goal of the match in the fifth-round replay away to Ipswich. He also scored a \"freak goal\" from a deflected Peter Storey clearance in the semi-final against Arsenal on 27 March 1971, but Stoke lost the replay four days later."]}, {"page": "Los Angeles Aztecs", "response": ["* Jackie Marsh"]}, {"page": "Tony Waddington", "response": ["Promotion was achieved in a thrilling 1962\u201363 season which saw Stoke take the Second Division title. With the euphoria of winning promotion over, Waddington knew that his side had to be strengthened to have any hope of surviving in the First Division and he broke the club's record transfer for Peter Dobing. He also brought in John Ritchie from non-league Kettering Town he would go on to become the club's record goalscorer. Stoke stayed up easily in 1963\u201364 and also reached the 1964 Football League Cup Final losing a 2 legged affair to Leicester City. Stoke then had several mid-table seasons before Waddington brought in World Cup winners George Eastham and Gordon Banks to the club in 1966\u201367. However two poor seasons followed 1967\u201368 and 1968\u201369 which saw Stoke narrowly avoid relegation. But another raid in the transfer market saw Stoke fortunes turn around dramatically, as Waddington brought in Jimmy Greenhoff and re-signed John Ritchie this combined with local players Alan Bloor, Denis Smith, Alan Dodd, Mike Pejic and Jackie Marsh plus the emergence of Terry Conroy, John Mahoney saw Stoke enjoy their best period in their history."]}, {"page": "1972 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||2 || Jackie Marsh"]}, {"page": "1967\u201368 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Jackie Marsh"]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Jackie Marsh"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["After two poor seasons, Tony Waddington recognised the goalscoring shortcomings and won over some of the worried supporters by bringing in former Leeds United forward Jimmy Greenhoff for a club record \u00a3100,000 and also brought back John Ritchie from Sheffield Wednesday.
