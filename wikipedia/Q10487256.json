He had moved from Junior football in Dundee to play for Burnley but his major triumphs were with Fulham, then a Southern League club, which he joined in 1904.  He played ninety eight games, mainly at right back, for Fulham between 1904 and 1908 and scored a total of nine goals.\nFulham had appointed Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1904 and \"Bradshaw's teams were built around a wonderful defence in which the consistent and highly regarded Fryer was supported by two Harrys at full back, Ross and Thorpe.\" He was described in 1905 as \"one of those players who can play equally well at right or left back. Physically he is the man for the place. Twenty four years of age, he weighs over thirteen stone and stands a trifle more than five feet ten.  He is a vigorous tackler and a powerful kick, and possesses all the attributes of mind and temper that go to make a first class player.\".Ross played for the 'Anglo-Scots' in an international trial in 1906 Fulham entered the Football League in 1907 and Ross captained them in 1907-08; In that season he had been carried shoulder high from the field, the hero of the hour, after Fulham had defeated Manchester United in a cup tie. From Fulham he moved back to Scotland with St Mirren and then signed for Brechin City, playing his first game on 29 October 1910 against Aberdeen A. Ross played seven games for Brechin City in season 1910-11.", "link_mentions": {}}}
