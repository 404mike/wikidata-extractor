Roache disliked this version, as he believed Ken's response lacked realism. Partly fuelled by his previous frustration with Ken's \"lame\" characterisation, Roache approached the episode's director, Brian Mills, and requested that Ken be allowed to hit Mike. Though the filming set-up planned for the scene did not allow for this, it was agreed that Ken would attempt to hit Mike, and that Deirdre would intervene.Roache 2010, pp.22\u201324"]}, {"page": "Mills (surname)", "response": ["*Brian Mills (born 1971), English footballer", "*Brian Mills, British television director"]}, {"page": "Brian Mills", "response": ["Brian Mills may refer to:", "*Brian Mills (footballer) (born 1971), English former footballer", "*Brian Mills (television director) (1933\u20132006), British television director"]}, {"page": "Brian Mills (film director)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Mills (television director)"]}]}}
