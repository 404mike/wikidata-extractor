He was born in London, England, but has lived most of his life in Edinburgh. He is Jewish. He is edited Contemporary Scottish Fiction, reprinted by Picador and Faber, and brought new Scottish writers to a wider audience.\nFrom 1980 to 1990 during Kravitz\u2019s term as editor, Polygon, the former University of Edinburgh student imprint, came to lead the field in publishing new Scottish fiction. His editorship of the Edinburgh Review from 1984 to 1990 supplied fresh talent. He was influential in developing discussion between people in literature, politics and the visual arts, in Scotland and beyond.\nWhile at Polygon, he tried to publish James Kelman's second novel, and requested a grant from the Scottish Arts Council. They refused on the basis of a complaint from Alick Buchanan-Smith, a Conservative MP, who complained about the \"foul language\" in Kelman's first novel. In the late 1990s, he worked for Napier University, and he is now a psychotherapist and counsellor in Edinburgh. He still writes occasionally on Scottish literature.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Scotland", "response": ["Some writers that emerged after the Second World War followed Hugh MacDiarmid by writing in Scots, including Robert Garioch and Sydney Goodsir Smith. Others demonstrated a greater interest in English language poetry, among them Norman MacCaig, George Bruce and Maurice Lindsay. George Mackay Brown from Orkney, and Iain Crichton Smith from Lewis, wrote both poetry and prose fiction shaped by their distinctive island backgrounds. The Glaswegian poet Edwin Morgan became known for translations of works from a wide range of European languages. He was also the first Scots Makar (the official national poet), appointed by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Muriel Spark, with The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961) spent much or most of their lives outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean, and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett. A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, this time led by a group of Glasgow writers associated with critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum and editor Peter Kravitz. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels, often overtly political, that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth, particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Carol Ann Duffy, who was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post."]}, {"page": "Scottish literature", "response": ["From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum.
