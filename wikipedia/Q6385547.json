Shortly following this, \"original\" style garage had made a return in a big way, with producers such as Moony, DJD and Tuff Culture paving the way. One of the genre's pioneering labels, Ice Cream Records, responsible for anthems such as \"RipGroove\", True Steppers' \"Out of Your Mind\", Kele Le Roc's \"My Love\" and more, opened up their permanent roster for the first time to include DJs outside of the legendary trio that launched the label."]}]}}
