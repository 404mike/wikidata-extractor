Two narrow away defeats followed, in what would be a season long pattern of success at home and defeat away. Terry Miles replaced Terry Lowe in a 2\u20130 win over Stockport County on 4 September to become Vale's first ever playing substitute. John Nicholson's club record run of 208 consecutive appearances, which began on 2 September 1961, ended on 8 September. Nicholson was unhappy with this and was consequently sold to Doncaster Rovers for \u00a35,000 \u2013 much to the distress of supporters. Attendances fell away to only 4,605 on 18 September, when Vale 'disgraced themselves' by only beating Lincoln City 3\u20130, who provided 'abysmal opposition'. Keeper Jimmy O'Neill was 'in vintage form', but twelve forwards were tried up front in the first ten games. On 2 October Jackie Mudie's 'extra craft' helped the Vale to thrash high-flying Chester 5\u20132, and two days later Vale beat Crewe Alexandra. However the club then played a friendly with SC Tasmania 1900 Berlin in Berlin (losing 2\u20130), and proceeded to lose their next six league games. The club then signed Jimmy Hill from Everton for \u00a35,000, however Hill seemed to be a replica of Mudie, rather than an addition to the firepower.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Terry Lowe", "| May 1966 || DF ||  || Terry Lowe ||  || Released || "]}]}}
