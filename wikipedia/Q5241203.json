Professor David Wilson, a criminologist who studied the police's initial response to the boys' disappearance, concluded that David and Patrick's working-class background affected how their case was handled:  \"If it had been two boys from [middle class] Solihull that went missing, that case would've been treated initially very differently. And it's about that word we're never allowed to use, class - this was about a class judgement that was made which was prepared to see them as runaways, as opposed to vulnerable.\"Their disappearance received little media attention beyond the local press, and this has been cited as an example of 'missing white girl syndrome'. However, the boys' faces were among the first to appear on milk cartons in a groundbreaking campaign launched by the National Missing Persons Helpline in April 1997. Just days after the boys disappeared, 17-year-old Nicola Dixon was found raped and murdered in a graveyard 8 miles away in Sutton Coldfield. Though her killer was found and convicted, the police say that police resources and media attention between New Years Day and Christmas 1996 was dominated by the Dixon case.", "It has since been ascertained by West Midlands Police that Field was driving round the area of the boys' last sighting in a van on the night of their disappearance, and that he was also under the influence of alcohol. This was notable as Field was known to have turned violent when drunk and that he committed most of his crimes under the influence of alcohol. Field himself said after confessing to Tutill's murder that alcohol was a trigger for him wanting to have sex and commit his crimes. Evidence also existed which indicated that Field had been seen speaking to the boys days before their disappearance, suggesting that Field may have groomed the children in the lead-up to their last sighting. This could explain why no one heard screams or a struggle on the night of the boys' disappearance, as the boys may have already known Field and got into his vehicle willingly. In 2021, criminologist David Wilson released a documentary as part of his Footsteps of Killers series on the subject of Warren and Spencer's disappearance, in which he spoke to Graham Hill, the detective that got Field to admit to him to the murder of Tutill in 2001. He interviewed Field a number of times about the boys' disappearance for West Midlands Police, and said that he believed Field was responsible for their murder.", "After the release of David Wilson's Footsteps of Killers documentary in 2021, locals organised a dig of a field off Damson Wood Lane in Solihull after a tip-off was received from a man who said he had seen a man digging there at the time of the boys' disappearance.
