With the follow-up single \"You Keep It All In\" reaching number 8 and \"I'll Sail This Ship Alone\" reaching number 31, the band were soon set to equal or surpass the success of The Housemartins, while the songwriting built on and expanded the trenchant social critiques which the previous band had been known for (topics included nationalism, domestic violence, football hooliganism and the self-serving industry of love songs, and the album's disturbing cover art also drew attention). Northern Irish singer Briana Corrigan was featured as a background vocalist on the album.

The initial lineup consisted of Heaton, Dave Rotheray on lead guitar, former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass, David Stead on drums and Housemartins former drummer Dave Hemingway, now in the role of joint lead singer and frontman. The writing partnership of Heaton and Rotheray proved very successful. The Beautiful South released two top ten singles, \"Song for Whoever\" and \"You Keep It All In\"; the latter featured Irish singer Briana Corrigan on vocals. In 1989, the band released an album, Welcome to the Beautiful South.

The detailed A House and Dave Couse discography at ZOP states that Couse and Bunbury worked on a project together in 2000, under the name Lokomotiv, recording an unreleased album titled the eighteenth Sunday in ordinary time, and that Couse also produced an album's worth of material with Briana Corrigan, formerly of the Beautiful South. However, almost none of Couse's work from this period has ever seen the light of day.

Featuring Paul Heaton's witty lyrics and vocals from him, Dave Hemingway and Briana Corrigan, it was a critical success too, being widely hailed for \"reinserting cynicism, doubt, and biting sarcasm into pop music.\" The album was a transformation for lead singer and lyricist Paul Heaton after his previous band The Housemartins; according to Robert Christgau, he turned \"his talents to the interpersonal. The surprise was that he didn't then cop out.\" The third single from the album, \"I'll Sail This Ship Alone\", reached number 31.", "According to Roch Pairisen of Allmusic, \"there are no big poses or walls of crunchy guitars on [the album]. Instead, the group \u2013 which includes three lead vocalists -deals in fragile melodies and harmonies, soulful but low-key instrumentation, and lyrics full of subtle social commentary and humour.\" He noted that \"at times, the group even couches itself in the guise of a smooth lounge act, rebelling against current trends by having something to say while not making a racket about it,\" and noted that producer Jon Kelly has \"contributed an incisive and full-bodied production\" to the album, \"a great improvement over the rather thin sound\" of Choke. According to Craig Tomashoff and David Hiltbrand of Picks and Pans, the album contains \"sweet pop music with insidious lyrics. It starts with the best pop melodies you can hum\u2014sort of like Elton John Does Detroit. Harmonious piano arrangements blend with songwriter Paul Heaton's soulful vocals and occasional backing horns to create 12 songs that work like aural lithium.\" They noted the contrast between the happy music and dark lyrics, saying \"one hit and you're happy for hours. Until you actually listen to what Heaton and his two co-lead vocalists, Dave Hemingway and Briana Corrigan, are saying. The tunes suggest light, happy odes to love. The words are dark, sardonic musings on human nature.\"", "Ted Kessler of Select said the first two songs \"Old Red Eyes Is Back\" and \"We are Each Other\" \"set the tone\" for the album. \"Pianos, strings and percussion are right down in the mix, the lead instruments are the gorgeous voices of Heaton, Hemingway and Briana Corrigan. There isn't a wailing guitar in sight\". \"Old Red Eyes Is Back\", described as the band's \"best song ever\" by Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler, is the tale of an \"old drunken waster looking back on his life, battling to overcome his alcohol dependency . Every time he falls off the wagon and succumbs to drink again....well, old red eyes is back.\" The song ends sadly, \"Old Red he died, and every single landlord in the district cried/An empty bottle of whiskey lying by his side...\" \"We Are Each Other\" is \"typical of the band from this period. Although a guitar is the first sound you hear on the song, it's restrained, and quickly gives way to the melody, harmony, and biting vocals that drive the song.\" It is more guitar-led than most of their output, and deals with \"a couple so close that their relationship can no longer function properly.\" Butler commented that \"the structure of the song is brilliant (this sort of attention to detail is just one of the many things that elevate The Beautiful South far beyond the vast majority of pop bands) \u2013 observe how the chorus is split into 2 halves, effectively making 2 brilliant hooks for the price of one.\" Robert Christgau considers the song to contain Heaton's \"meanest\" line, \"Closer than a sister to her baby brother/Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother.\"", "Vocal duties on \"Bell Bottomed Tear\" are handled mainly by Briana Corrigan, though Heaton does appear at points. It has been noted that \"the strengths of her voice is exploited very well here \u2013 sugary, with a slight hiccup, but always fragile and vaguely damaged.\" One reviewer said \"her character here is never made explicitly clear \u2013 she's  a man who has got her pregnant, though whether she and the man are still together isn't made clear. Either way, he's ruined her life. Quietly devastating.\" \"Here it is Again\" is a \"brooding\" song, whilst \"You Play Glockenspiel, I'll Play Drums\" is \"odd\". Closing song \"When I'm 84\" encapsulates the album's \"dizzily wayward feel\" and is a song of \"innante funkiness,\" \"blessed with a groovy electronic piano and a bassline worth suing for. It contains Heaton's hedonistic and bold plans for retirement. 'Exercise your muscles?', he spits. 'I'd rather jack.'\"", "The album was released to positive reviews. Ted Kessler of Select gave the album a perfect five out of five score, saying \"under a veneer of polished pop production The Beautiful South are contrary, twisted mavericks, and 0898 is the bright, acceptable face of the foul beast AOR \u2013 and their best work to date\". Robert Christgau rated the album \"A\u2013\", saying \"even more obscure stateside since he got lusher conventions, songsmith Paul Heaton does his endangered species proud. The tunes stick, and the lyrics transcend their sarcastic shtick\u2014predictably idiosyncratic though 'You do English/Ill do sums/You break fingers/Ill break thumbs' may be, it brings you up short anyway. Peter Gabriel/Kate Bush hand Jon Kelly adds musical authenticity, and third vocalist Briana Corrigan sings lines like 'This is the woman you laid' with just the right edge of icy remorse.
