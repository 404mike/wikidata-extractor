In a fifteen-year professional career in the English Football League he scored 114 goals in 474 league appearances.\nAfter failing to make an impression at Birmingham City and Walsall, he made his name at Port Vale between 1968 and 1974, making a total of 229 appearances for the \"Valiants\". During this time he helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in the 1969\u201370 season. Following a loan spell at Stockport County, he transferred to Southport in 1974, before arriving at Colchester United two years later. He helped Colchester out of the Fourth Division in 1976\u201377, and scored a total of 80 goals in 232 games, before he departed for non-league Hendon in 1981. He later turned out for Chelmsford City, before he left football for the building trade.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["The club were a poor outfit Fourth Division when he took charge, and to boost the squad he signed 'tenacious' wing-half John King and Wales international winger Graham Williams from Tranmere Rovers, as well as Walsall's teenage Bobby Gough. With goalkeeper Stuart Sharratt out injured, he brought in Geoff Hickson on loan from Crewe Alexandra. Despite inconsistent results, fans threw their support behind Lee after witnessing consistent improvements in the Vale's performances. He solved his goalkeeping problems by signing Keith Ball from Walsall for 'a small fee', and his side put together a five-game unbeaten run in November. He adopted a more 'hit and run' style in March, and his side ended the campaign in 13th place with 46 points from their 46 games, scoring 46 and conceding 46 goals."]}, {"page": "List of Port Vale F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Bobby Gough"]}, {"page": "Robert George Gough", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bobby Gough"]}, {"page": "Robert Gough", "response": ["* Bobby Gough, English footballer"]}, {"page": "John Froggatt", "response": ["Svarc and Smith left the club in summer 1975, leaving Froggatt behind at Colchester.

New manager Gordon Lee thus began work on rebuilding his squad, announcing a team approach with an additional 'individual coaching plan' for players to improve their personal weaknesses. Lee was big on coaching, and replaced cross country running exercises with realistic match-day situations. Stanley Matthews would become more of a scout and would only visit Burslem on a weekly basis, he also agreed to allow the \u00a39,000 owed to him in payments delayed until the club were on a sounder financial footing. His name removed from his office door, he 'gradually drifted out of the picture'.

Tommy McLaren then returned from injury to lead Vale on a four match winning streak that included a 2\u20130 win over fallen-giants Aston Villa in front of a Burslem crowd of 11,224 fans. Four straight defeats soon came after this sequence however, as Vale's form was patchy. In December, Ron Wilson left the club as he emigrated to South Africa due to his son's ill health. A 1\u20130 defeat at Villa Park on 16 January was the first of a nine match streak without a victory. At the end of the month Lee signed John Brodie from Northern Premier League side Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a3250.
