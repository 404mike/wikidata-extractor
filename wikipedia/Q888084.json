The intro features a counterpoint bass melody and a chugging guitar riff that resolves into a standard down-picked riff. \"Escape\" is Hetfield's most disliked Metallica song, due to it being the result of the record company forcing Metallica to write something more radio friendly. Book authors Mick Wall and Malcolm Dome said the song was influenced by the album-oriented rock of 1970s bands such as Journey and Foreigner, but fans perceived it as an attempt for airplay on rock radio. Metallica has so far performed \"Escape\" live only once, at the 2012 Orion Music\u00a0+ More festival, while performing Ride the Lightning in its entirety."]}, {"page": "The Band", "response": ["The Band has influenced numerous bands, songwriters and performers, including the Grateful Dead; Eric Clapton; George Harrison; Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young;Gray, 36\u201337.

In Q in 1987, David Hepworth wrote: \"Marillion may represent the inelegant, unglamorous, public bar end of the current Rock Renaissance but they are no less part of it for that. Clutching at Straws suggests that they may be finally coming in from the cold.\"David Hepworth (July 1987) Review of Clutching at Straws, Q Magazine (archived at Official Fish Site) In the same magazine in 1995, Dave Henderson wrote: \"It's not yet possible to be sacked for showing an affinity for Marillion, but has there ever been a band with a larger stigma attached?\" He also argued that if the album Afraid of Sunlight \"had been made by a new, no baggage-of-the-past combo, it would be greeted with open arms, hailed as virtual genius.\"Dave Henderson Q, August 1995.

What are Radiohead if not a progressive band?\" and said Marillion were \"making strong, singular music with the courage of their convictions, and we should treasure them more than we do.\" In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, an article on Marillion written by Mick Wall described them as \"probably the most misunderstood band in the world\".Mick Wall Q Classic: Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, 2005."]}, {"page": "...And Justice for All (album)", "response": ["In a retrospective review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that ...And Justice for All was both the band's \"most ambitious\" and ultimately \"flattest-sounding\" album. AllMusic's Steve Huey noted that Metallica followed the blueprint of the previous two albums, with more sophisticated songs and \"apocalyptic\" lyrics that envisioned a society in decay. Music journalist Mick Wall was critical of the progressive elements on the album and believed that, apart from \"One\" and \"Dyers Eve\", most of the album sounded clumsy. Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), wrote that, apart from the praiseworthy \"One\", the album diminished the band's creativity by concentrating the songs with too many riffs. Ulrich said in retrospect that the album has improved with time and it is well-liked among their contemporaries."]}, {"page": "Dr. Feelgood (album)", "response": ["Canadian journalist Martin Popoff wrote that Dr. Feelgood is an album \"made by a dumb band trying really hard\" while a BBC Music reviewer declared it \"a glitzy flashy experience... ultimately shallow and narcissistic\".

Dr. Feelgood, wrote Mick Wall in a review of 2009's reissue, \"was the first time M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce actually became well-known for music. Until then, their unthinking mash-up of glam and metal had made them a hoot onstage but a disappointment on record\u2026 Though pushed close by last year's shock return with the weighty Saints of Los Angeles, [the album is] the best M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce have ever released.\""]}, {"page": "Kill 'Em All", "response": ["\"(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth\" is a bass solo by Burton, accompanied on drums by Ulrich. A staple of Burton's live performances since his high school days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive \"lead-bass\" style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as \"Bass solo, take one\", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. \"(Anesthesia)-Pulling Teeth\" was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: \"We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was up there on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was looking down at his bass, playing.\" \"Whiplash\" was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that \"Whiplash\" signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: \"If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it.\""]}, {"page": "Status Quo (band)", "response": ["*Francis Rossi, Rick Parfitt, Mick Wall: Status Quo.

He also noted that while the album sold well, \"the partnership didn't last and we should probably be grateful for that\".

He argued that, because it plays like an authentic blues song and \"has the grandeur of a symphonic crescendo\", their version both transcends and dignifies \"the quasi-parodic overstatement and oddly cerebral mood of\" their past blues songs. Mick Wall called it a \"hypnotic, blues rock mantra\".  AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in a retrospective review, commented that the song was the only piece on their fourth album on par with \"Stairway to Heaven\" and called it \"an apocalyptic slice of urban blues\u00a0... as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them.\""]}, {"page": "Gary Moore", "response": ["During the early hours of 6 February 2011, Moore died of a heart attack in his sleep at the age of 58.

According to Dickinson on the Death on the Road live album, it is about \"the whole process of writing and being a musician\", although Mick Wall describes it as \"a wistful tale of carpe diem\". The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, \"after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music it just seemed right to play out with something totally unexpected and left field.\" The original version appears on the No More Lies EP."]}, {"page": "Peter Grant (music manager)", "response": ["Grant was soon attracted to the entertainment industry, and worked as a stagehand for the Croydon Empire Theatre until 1953, when he was called up for national service in the RAOC, reaching the rank of corporal.Led Zeppelin In Their Own Words compiled by Paul Kendall (1981), London: Omnibus Press. , pp. 17\u201318.

According to Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, the band began accepting contributions from other artists as \"We wanted to upgrade Eddie for the 90s.
