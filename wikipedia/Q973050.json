Originally presented as a precognitive in the pages of Captain Britain and then as a telepath, the character eventually had her mind placed in the body of the Japanese female ninja Kwannon, gaining many of Kwannon's martial arts skills and elements of her personality, as Lady Mandarin. Betsy's codename, coined by the villains Mojo and Spiral, debuted during her introduction to the X-Men stories post\u2013Captain Britain. Later, Betsy acquired the power of telekinesis. After finally regaining her own body and relinquishing the Psylocke identity to Kwannon, Betsy permanently took up the mantle of Captain Britain in 2019.\nMany alternative versions of the character have also appeared in several comics series of Marvel Multiverse, as well as in various other media and merchandise, notably in numerous video games.
