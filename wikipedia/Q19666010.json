In the first of the two matches, he appeared for I Zingari, a wandering amateur cricket club, playing as a specialist batsman, albeit low in the batting order. He scored four runs in the match, although he was not out without scoring in the second innings. In his following match, he batted as number eleven for the Marylebone Cricket Club, and made a duck in the first innings, before once again remaining not out without scoring in the second innings. He continued to play for I Zingari on a number of occasions between 1866 and 1878. He made his highest score for the club in an 1871 match against Huntingdonshire, when he remained 27 not out. He served in Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service. He died in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 20 November 1884.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Langley", "response": ["Henry Langley may refer to:", "* Henry Langley (architect) (1836\u20131907), Canadian architect", "* Henry Langley (bishop) (1840\u20131906), first Anglican bishop of Bendigo", "* Henry Langley (Dean of Melbourne) (1877\u20131968), Anglican priest in Australia", "* Henry Langley (Master of Pembroke) (1611\u20131679), English academic, priest and Master of Pembroke College, Oxford", "* Henry Langley (cricketer) (1846\u20131884), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Henry Langley (1866) : H.
