Rollason is an English historian and medievalist. He is a Professor in history at Durham University. He specialises in the cult of saints in Anglo-Saxon England, the history of Northumbria and in the historical writings of Durham, most notably producing a modern edition and translation of the Libellus de exordio and co-operating on an edition of the Durham Liber Vitae.\nOutside of his academic interests, David Rollason is a keen cyclist, cycling 175 miles from Edinburgh to Seaton Delaval to raise money to assist the National Trust in their purchase of Seaton Delaval Hall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward the Martyr", "response": ["The rise of Edward's cult has been interpreted in various ways. It is sometimes portrayed as a popular movement, or as the product of a political attack on King \u00c6thelred by former supporters of Edward. Alternatively, \u00c6thelred has been seen as one of the key forces in the promotion of Edward's cult and that of their sister Eadgifu (Edith of Wilton). He was thought to make the charter in 1001 granting land to Shaftesbury at the elevation of Edward's relics, and some accounts suggest that \u00c6thelred legislated the observation of Edward's feast days across England in a law code of 1008. It is unclear whether this innovation, seemingly drafted by Archbishop Wulfstan II, dates from \u00c6thelred's reign.  It may instead have been promulgated by King Cnut. David Rollason has drawn attention to the increased importance of the cults of other murdered royal saints in this period. Among these are the cults of King Ecgberht of Kent's nephews, whose lives form part of the Mildrith Legend, and those of the Mercian Saints Kenelm and Wigstan.Williams, \u00c6thelred the Unready, pp. 14\u201317; Rollason, Mildrith Legend, pp. 53\u201357; Hart, \"Edward\", p. 785; Miller, \"Edward the Martyr\"; Ridyard, Royal Saints, pp. 154\u2013175."]}, {"page": "Minster-in-Thanet", "response": ["The third known abbess was Sigeburh, who was activeWilliam George Searle, onomasticon (Cambridge University Press Archive, 1879) page 418. around 762 AD and is known from the Secgan hagiography and from Royal charters.David Rollason, \u2018Mildrith (fl. 716\u2013c. 733)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (Oxford University Press,2004 ).

In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where Rollason states that he was accepted as king by the local Vikings. However, David Dumville points out that in the next year \u00c6thelwold persuaded the Danes in East Anglia to wage war against Edward, and Dumville argues that it is unlikely that there was an unknown separate Viking army in Essex. In his view \u00c6thelwold was aiming to secure recognition in part of the kingdom of Wessex in order to strengthen his claim to the throne, and he succeeded in gaining the submission of the English rulers of Essex."]}, {"page": "Eadwulf II of Northumbria", "response": ["The only thing which can be said with reasonable certainty of Eadwulf is that he died in 913 in Northumbria, an event recorded by the chronicle of \u00c6thelweard and by the Irish Annals of Ulster and Annals of Clonmacnoise. The Irish sources call him \"king of the Saxons of the north\" while \u00c6thelweard says Eadwulf \"ruled as reeve of the town called Bamburgh\". The Historia de Sancto Cuthberto states that Eadwulf had been a favourite () of King Alfred the Great. Historians have traditionally followed \u00c6thelweard and portrayed Eadwulf as ruler of only the northern part of Northumbria, perhaps corresponding to the former kingdom of Bernicia, with Scandinavian or Norse-Gael kings ruling the southern part, the former kingdom of Deira, an area broadly similar to Yorkshire. Some historians now question this. For example, Benjamin Hudson writes that Eadwulf \"might have ruled just the northern part of Northumbria, the old Kingdom of Bernicia, although it is not impossible that he ruled all of Northumbria\"Hudson, p. 21 and Clare Downham notes that the death of Eadwulf \"is so widely reported in 913 that it seems hard to envisage that his fame derived from a three-year reign\".Downham, p. 88. Some interpretations make Eadwulf ruler in Bernicia after Ecgberht II, that is to say from the 870s approximately. David Rollason described Eadwulf as an earl who flourished between about 890 and 912, and ruled an area north of the River Tyne and extending into what is now southern Scotland from the old Northumbrian royal centre at Bamburgh.Rollason, p. 213. According to Benjamin Hudson, in 913 Eadred son of Rixinc invaded Eadwulf's territory and killed him, then seized his wife and went to the sanctuary of the lands of St Cuthbert south of the River Tyne.Hudson, \u2032Ealdred (d. 933?), leader of the Northumbrians\u2032."]}, {"page": "Osulf I of Bamburgh", "response": ["Osulf's origins are unclear.
