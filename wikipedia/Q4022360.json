The band drew its name from her 1968 composition \"Fotheringay\" about Fotheringhay Castle, in which Mary, Queen of Scots had been imprisoned. The song originally appeared on the 1969 Fairport Convention album, What We Did on Our Holidays, Denny's first album with that group.  The original Fotheringay released one self-titled album but disbanded at the start of 1971 as Denny embarked on a solo career.
