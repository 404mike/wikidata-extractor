From that, he moved into property and other transactions, making large sums of money in major deals. He became a racehorse owner and theatre proprietor.\nWhite finally overreached himself financially, and being unable to meet his huge liabilities, committed suicide at the age of 50.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wembley Stadium (1923)", "response": ["At the end of the exhibition, which proved to be a financial disappointment, the site at Wembley was considered by many to be a vast 'white elephant'.
