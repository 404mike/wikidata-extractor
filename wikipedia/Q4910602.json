After the break Southampton had a chance to draw level when Harry Pantling fouled Bill Rawlings in the penalty area. The resulting penalty was taken by Tom Parker but his shot was saved by Charles Sutcliffe.

In 1920 Southampton, along with most Southern League clubs, joined the inaugural Football League Third Division.
