Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s, including new turnstiles, refurbished dressing rooms, new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room being readied, hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened. The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991, and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier. It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End, and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United.

The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 as part of a sponsorship deal with Nestl\u00e9.

The Shipton Street Roof Appeal was launched in the spring of 1988 to raise money for a stand, and fundraising schemes were put into place. On 8 September 1990, York player David Longhurst collapsed and died from heart failure during a match against Lincoln City at Bootham Crescent. With the approval of his family, the David Longhurst Memorial Fund was launched, and all donations were added to the monies already raised for the roof appeal. The Football Trust contributed half of the \u00a3150,000 cost of the stand, and it was constructed in the summer of 1991.

In May 1995, a new drainage system was installed for \u00a311,000, to improve the quality of the pitch during winter. New floodlights were installed in June 1995 at a cost of \u00a3122,000, and despite being shorter in height were twice as powerful as the original floodlights.

Douglas Craig, who had been on the board since 1978, succeeded Michael Sinclair as chairman in June 1991. York had won 2 of 11 matches by mid October 1991; Bird was dismissed and was replaced in November by Aston Villa assistant manager John Ward. York continued to be placed in lower midtable, and finished fourth from bottom for the second year running in 1991\u201392. They started 1992\u201393 with a club-record start of four wins, and led the table until late December 1992. Ward left for Bristol Rovers in March 1993, shortly after a midseason slump in which York won only 1 of 13 matches. Ward's assistant Alan Little took over and York finished the season in fourth place.
