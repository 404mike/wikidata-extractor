The following year, she released her comeback single, \"Spinning Around\", which garnered critical and commercial success in Australasia and Europe, and led to her releasing a follow-up single from Light Years. \"On a Night Like This\" was originally written for Swedish recording artist Pandora by Steve Torch, Brian Rawling, Graham Stack, and Mark Taylor, with production being handled by the latter two. Pandora recorded it for her 1999 album, No Regrets, but its composers reportedly believed the result to not gain as much success as they had hoped. As a result, they handed the recording to Parlophone and suggested Minogue to record her vocals over the backing track, which she did.

Minogue recorded the track at Dreamhouse Studios in London, United Kingdom during early 2000, and it was mixed by Mark Taylor and Graham Stack. A staff member of Pandora Radio commented the recording's instrumentation as consisting of string sections, acoustic guitars, keyboards and synthesisers managed by Taylor and Stack; the pre-chorus and chorus sections feature background vocals. According to the sheet music published by Universal Music, the song is written in the key of C minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 130 beats per minute. Minogue's vocals span from B\u266d3 to C5, whilst the recording has a sequence of Cm-B\u266d-Fm7-B\u266d-Cm-B\u266d-FM7-B\u266d-Cm-B\u266d/C-Fm7/C-B\u266d/C in the verses, and Cm-B\u266d/C-A\u266d-B\u266d in the chorus as its chord progression.
