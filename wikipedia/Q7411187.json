He was born at Bradfield Monachorum, now known as Bradfield St George, Suffolk, England.\nCrossman earned a Bachelor of Divinity at Pembroke College, University of Cambridge, and was Prebendary of Bristol. After graduation, he ministered to both an Anglican congregation at All Saints, Sudbury, and to a Puritan congregation simultaneously. Crossman sympathised with the Puritan cause, and attended the 1661 Savoy Conference, which attempted to update the Book of Common Prayer so that both Puritans and Anglicans could use it. The conference failed, and the 1662 Act of Uniformity expelled Crossman along with some 2,000 other Puritan-leaning ministers from the Church of England. He renounced his Puritan affiliations shortly afterwards, and was ordained in 1665, becoming a royal chaplain. He received a post at Bristol in 1667, and became Dean of Bristol Cathedral in 1683. He died on 4 February 1683 (O.S.; 1684 N.S. \u2013 see Old Style and New Style dates), at Bristol, and lies buried in the south aisle of the cathedral at Bristol.\nSeveral of Crossman's hymns are preserved in the Sacred Harp.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sacred Harp hymnwriters and composers", "response": ["*Samuel Crossman (1623\u20131683)"]}, {"page": "My Song Is Love Unknown", "response": ["\"My Song Is Love Unknown\" is a hymn by Samuel Crossman, written in 1664.

During his exile from the Church of England, he wrote \"My Song Is Love Unknown\" as a poem in 1664. It was first published in The Young Man\u2019s Meditation and then became published as an Anglican hymn in 1684, after Crossman had rejoined the Church of England in 1665 and two years after his death. The last verse of the hymn was written as an imitation of George Herbert's The Temple poem as a tribute by Crossman to Herbert. In the 21st century, the language of the hymn is sometimes updated by hymnal editors, a move which is often lamented by traditional hymnologists who feel that the newer language loses the original meaning and nuance."]}, {"page": "Jerusalem On High", "response": ["Jerusalem On High is a hymn written by minister Samuel Crossman and music composed by Charles Steggall."]}, {"page": "Sweet Place", "response": ["Sweet Place is a hymn by Samuel Crossman and music composed by John Darwall and Aaron Williams."]}, {"page": "Crossman", "response": ["* Samuel Crossman (1623\u20131683), English churchman and hymnwriter"]}, {"page": "Dean of Bristol", "response": ["*1683\u20131684 Samuel Crossman"]}, {"page": "Theophilus Dorrington", "response": ["* Reform'd Devotions  London, 1687 (fourth edition, reviewed, London, 1696; sixth edition, London, 1704; ninth edition, London, 1727).
