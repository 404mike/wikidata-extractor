The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas, and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, henceforth giving Bond both a dry sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007, gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921."]}, {"page": "Dr. No (novel)", "response": ["The reviewer for Time acknowledged the critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No, but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while \"not all readers will agree that Dr. No\u00a0... is magnificent writing,\u00a0... pages of it, at least, qualify for Ezra Pound's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer: 'At last, an unprintable book that is readable'.\" In The New York Times, Anthony Boucher\u2014described by Fleming's biographer John Pearson as \"throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man\"\u2014was again damning of Fleming's work, saying \"it's harder than ever to see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales\".

Boucher further wrote that the novel contained \"as usual, sex-cum-sadism with a veneer of literacy but without the occasional brilliant setpieces\". The critic for the New York Herald Tribune, conversely, wrote that \"Mr Fleming is intensely observant, acutely literate and can turn a clich\u00e9 into a silk purse with astute alchemy\". Robert R Kirsch, writing in the Los Angeles Times, also disagreed with Boucher, saying that \"the espionage novel has been brought up to date by a superb practitioner of that nearly lost art: Ian Fleming.\" In Kirsch's opinion, From Russia, with Love \"has everything of the traditional plus the most modern refinements in the sinister arts of spying\"."]}, {"page": "J.

There he worked with Ian Fleming, who was the Foreign Manager of the department, and the two men became friends. In a letter to John Pearson in 1965 when he was researching his biography on Ian Fleming, The Life of Ian Fleming, Jenkins revealed that in the late 1950s he had discussed the idea of a James Bond novel set in South Africa with Fleming, and even written a synopsis of it, which Fleming had very much liked. Fleming had said he would come to South Africa to research the book, but he died before this happened. Pearson was understandably excited by this revelation, and even more so when he found Jenkins' Bond synopsis in Fleming's papers.", "Not much is known of the plot for Per Fine Ounce. The reference work The Bond Files by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson indicates that it was based upon a story Jenkins claimed he and Fleming had worked on around 1957, and that the storyline was set in South Africa and dealt with diamond smugglers and a spy ring and bore some resemblance to Fleming's Bond novel Diamonds Are Forever as well as his non-Bond work, The Diamond Smugglers. However, in an interview with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang magazine published in 2005, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming's former literary agent and former chairman of Glidrose, claimed that he believed the story may have been about gold. This makes more sense, as the title derives from the line \"per fine Troy ounce\" or a variation of. A fine ounce is a Troy ounce of not quite pure gold. Jenkins' synopsis found by John Pearson in Fleming's papers featured gold bicycle chains, baobab tree coffins and the magical Lake Fundudzi\u2014presumably, Jenkins used some or all of these elements in the book itself. Four draft pages of the manuscript were discovered in 2005, in which we learn that the Double-O Section has been closed down and James Bond defies M on a matter of principle, resigning from MI6 to pursue his mission in South Africa alone."]}, {"page": "James Bond uncollected and other miscellaneous short stories", "response": ["The name of Bond's son, James Suzuki, is taken from the John Pearson faux biography, James Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007."]}]}}
