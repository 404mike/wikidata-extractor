They slipped a little in 1930 but then came good and were fourth, second, second and second from 1931 to 1934. They were very close to their first official title in both the latter two seasons when one more win might have swung the balance. Sussex fell away in 1935 and were in mid-table from then to 1939. Noted batsmen were Ted Bowley, Tom Cook, Duleepsinhji, and the two pairs of brothers James and John Langridge, Harry and Jim Parks Sr. Sussex had the future South African Test captain Alan Melville in their team during the mid-1930s. Sussex had one of the all-time great bowlers in Maurice Tate. Vallance Jupp played for them in the early 1920s and other good or useful bowlers were Bowley, Jim Cornford, George Cox Jr, James Langridge, Jim Parks and Albert Wensley. Sussex keeper George Street was killed in a road accident at the beginning of the 1924 season and Tich Cornford succeeded him.", "There were 45 instances of 75 dismissals in a season. 44 of these were by wicket-keepers, as would be expected, and one by a fielder. In 1928, Wally Hammond played in 35 matches and took 79 catches, all as a fielder. In the same season, Les Ames (122) and George Duckworth (107) both achieved the rare milestone of 100 dismissals in a season. Ames did even better in 1929, completing 128 dismissals, and in 1932 he completed 104. Ted Brooks achieved 75 dismissals six times. He was followed by Ames, Duckworth and Fred Price (five each); Harry Elliott and Arthur Wood (four each); Tich Cornford and Ben Lilley (three each); George Street (twice) and seven others at one apiece."]}]}}
