She made her Bristol debut on 22 April 2014 as a 60th-minute substitute for Molly Clarke in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Lincoln Ladies. On 26 May 2013, James appeared as a halftime substite for Alex Windell during the 2013 FA Women's Cup Final. Bristol lost 3\u20130 to Arsenal. James played in 13 of Bristol's 14 league games during the 2013 FA WSL season as the team earned their highest ever finish, runners-up behind Liverpool. The two met on the final day of the season separated by two points with Liverpool winning 2\u20130 to clinch the title. During the 2015 FA WSL season, James played in all 14 games as the Vixens were relegated. She left following the team's relegation having made 83 appearances in all competitions, scoring six goals. On her departure, Bristol manager Willie Kirk said, \"You never want to lose top players, but following relegation it was inevitable that we would lose a few. Angharad played a big part in the club's successes over the past few seasons and at only 21 has bags of potential and can achieve a lot in the game... Angharad made her intentions to stay in WSL1 known to me very quickly so we have been planning for this for a while now.\""]}, {"page": "2015 FA WSL", "response": ["|  Alex Windell || MF || Bristol Academy || ", "|  Alex Windell || MF || Birmingham City || "]}, {"page": "Alexandra Windell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alex Windell"]}, {"page": "2017 Birmingham City L.F.C. season", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Alex Windell"]}]}}
