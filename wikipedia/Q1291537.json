Fox, Henderson & Co. and designed by Edward Alfred Cowper of that firm, who had previously worked on the design of the Crystal Palace. When completed, New Street had the largest arched single-span iron and glass roof in the world, spanning a width of  and being  long. It held this title for 14 years until St Pancras station opened in 1868. It was originally intended to have three spans, supported by columns, however,  it was soon realised that the supporting columns would severely restrict the workings of the railway. Cowper's single-span design, was therefore adopted, even though it was some 62 feet (19 metres) wider than the widest roof span at that time.  George Gilbert Scott praised Cowper's roof at New Street, stating \"An iron roof in its most normal condition is too spider-like a structure to be handsome, but with a very little attention this defect is obviated. The most wonderful specimen, probably, is that at the great Birmingham Station\u2026\" When first opened, New Street was described as the \"Grand Central Station at Birmingham\" by Richard Foster."]}, {"page": "Second Industrial Revolution", "response": ["The early technique of hot blast used iron for the regenerative heating medium.  Iron caused problems with expansion and contraction, which stressed the iron and caused failure. Edward Alfred Cowper developed the Cowper stove in 1857. This stove used firebrick as a storage medium, solving the expansion and cracking problem.  The Cowper stove was also capable of producing high heat, which resulted in very high throughput of blast furnaces.  The Cowper stove is still used in today's blast furnaces."]}, {"page": "Institution of Mechanical Engineers", "response": ["|Edward Alfred Cowper"]}, {"page": "Detonator (railway)", "response": ["A railway detonator (torpedo in North America) is a coin-sized device that is used as a loud warning signal to train drivers. It is placed on the top of the rail, usually secured with two lead straps, one on each side. When the wheel of the train passes over, it explodes, emitting a loud bang. It was invented in 1841 by English inventor Edward Alfred Cowper."]}, {"page": "Regenerative heat exchanger", "response": ["Edward Alfred Cowper applied the regeneration principle to blast furnaces, in the form of the \"Cowper stove\", patented in 1857.Bennet Woodcroft, 'Chronological Index of Patents Applied for and Patents Granted, for the Year 1857', Patent No.1404, 19 May 1857 https://books.google.com/books?id=zXMyAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=index+of+patents&hl=en&sa=X&ei=A6cpU7vGKM3xhQef5ICIAg&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=edward%20alfred%20cowper&f=false This is almost invariably used with blast furnaces to this day.C.
