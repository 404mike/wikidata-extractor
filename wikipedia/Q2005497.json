Hooker was the youngest of the 128-man crew. He sailed on the Erebus and was assistant to Robert McCormick, who in addition to being the ship's Surgeon was instructed to collect zoological and geological specimens. The ships sailed on 30 September 1839. Before journeying to Antarctica they visited Madeira, Tenerife, Santiago and Quail Island in the Cape Verde archipelago, St Paul Rocks, Trinidade east of Brazil, St Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope.

This elite disdained research done for money and felt that natural philosophy was for gentlemen, not tradesmen. The officer class of the Army and Navy provided a way to ascend this hierarchy; it was commonly the ship's surgeon who collected specimens on voyages, and Robert McCormick had secured the official position of surgeon on Beagle after taking part in earlier expeditions and studying natural history. A sizeable collection had considerable social value, attracting wide public interest, and McCormick aspired to fame as an exploring naturalist. Collections made by the ship's surgeon and other officers were government property, though the Admiralty was not consistent on this, and went to important London establishments, usually the British Museum. The Admiralty instructions for the first voyage had required officers \"to use their best diligence in increasing the Collections in each ship: the whole of which must be understood to belong to the Public\", but on the second voyage this requirement was omitted, and the officers were free to keep all the specimens for themselves.", "Customarily, the ship's surgeon took the position of a naturalist, and Beagle surgeon Robert McCormick sought fame and fortune as an explorer. When they first met at the start of the voyage, Darwin had commented that \"My friend [McCormick] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably\". They walked into the countryside of St. Jago together, and Darwin, influenced by Lyell, found the surgeon's approach old-fashioned. They found a remarkable baobab tree, which FitzRoy measured and sketched. Darwin went on subsequent \"riding expeditions\" with Benjamin Bynoe and Rowlett to visit Ribeira Grande and St Domingo. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days to complete his measurements of magnetism. Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included \"several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, & evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.\u2014yellowish green, dark brown & red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, as far as I can find out.\" Henslow replied that \"The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly important.\"", "On 4 April, they entered the harbour of Rio de Janeiro to make observations of longitude from Villegagnon Island. Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then, Robert McCormick had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon Benjamin Bynoe was made acting surgeon in his place. McCormick felt \"very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed in the way of my getting on shore and making collections\" while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections. On 26 April, Darwin moved into a house he had rented at Botafogo and stayed there with three others when Beagle left on 10 May to recheck observations at Bahia. FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of  in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of Albin Roussin, and decided to go back. A seaman, a ship's boy and a young midshipman had caught a fever after visiting the Macacu River and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and the Abrolhos reefs were correct, after which he sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July."]}, {"page": "1800 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 22 July \u2013 Robert McCormick, Royal Navy surgeon and explorer (died 1890)"]}, {"page": "McCormick (surname)", "response": ["* Robert McCormick (explorer) (1800\u20131890), British Royal Navy surgeon, explorer and naturalist"]}, {"page": "Adare Peninsula", "response": ["Fenwick Ice Piedmont is an ice piedmont on the east side of Adare Peninsula, formed by numerous glaciers draining the east side of the peninsula between the Downshire Cliffs and Cape McCormick.
