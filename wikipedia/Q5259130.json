The first lacked sufficient power to fly, but the second, a canard biplane, made the first powered flight in Scotland, piloted by Harold in July 1909.Flying in ScotlandFlight 31 July 1909 but was wrecked on the second attempt to fly it.  The third, a mid-wing monoplane, was built during 1910 and flown by to win a prize for the first flight of over a mile in Scotland on 30 January 1911 at Causewayhead under the Wallace Monument.  In late 1911 Barnwell was hired to work as a designer for a secret department set up by the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company to work on an unconventional seaplane project for the Admiralty in collaboration with Dennistoun Burney, resulting in the unsuccessful Bristol-Burney seaplanes.  He then co-designed the Bristol Scout with Harry Busteed.  When war broke out in 1914 Barnwell enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps and after qualifying as a pilot at the Central Flying School, Upavon, he joined 12 Squadron RFC but in August 1915 was released from service to become chief designer at Bristol.  Here he put his experience of service conditions to use by designing the Bristol Fighter, one of the outstanding aircraft of the war.

At the same time, there was a freelance research by the U.S. Army's Infantry Section of a man-portable recoilless 57 mm cannon by two engineers, named Kroger and Musser. Instead of a blowout plug, the infantry section's recoilless cannon used a British development, Ordnance, RCL, 3.45 in developed by Dennistoun Burney, from in which the cartridge case had hundreds of small holes in the side walls with a lining of plastic on the inside of the cartridge case walls to keep water and other elements out until the round was fired. Another unique innovation was the use of pre-engraving bands on the 57 mm projectile that engaged the barrel's rifling.While many sources claim the pre-engraving on the M18 projectiles drive band in 1943 was a first, the Germans in World War I had this feature on projectiles for their famous Paris Gun. Later it was discovered that pre-engraving the band gave no advantage and future rounds were produced without this feature. The belief was this feature would reduce friction on firing, allowing more of the propellant gases to be used to force the shell towards the target and less being used to achieve the recoilless effect and therefore giving their design a much higher muzzle velocity than most recoilless cannon at that time period had achieved.Ian Hogg The Guns 1939-45 page 151 Ballantine Books 1970.With most recoilless cannon, there is a 1-to-9 ratio\u2014meaning that when the weapon is fired, one part of the propellant gases is used to force the shell forward and the other 9 parts of the propellant gases are expelled to the back to counter act that forward force, achieving a recoilless effect."]}, {"page": "Sir Dennistoun Burney, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dennistoun Burney"]}, {"page": "Dennis Burney", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dennistoun Burney"]}, {"page": "Charles Burney (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Dennistoun Burney (Sir Charles Dennistoun Burney, 2nd Baronet, 1888\u20131968), English aeronautical engineer, private inventor and Conservative Party politician"]}, {"page": "Burney (surname)", "response": ["*Dennistoun Burney (1888\u20131968), British engineer and inventor"]}, {"page": "Bristol-Burney seaplanes", "response": ["The Bristol-Burney seaplanes were a pair of experimental seaplanes produced by a collaboration between Lt.
