Under FA Rule 'F', the Football League and Wimbledon were informed of these appointments; neither objected. Acknowledging Koppel's request that the matter be resolved by the end of the month because of Wimbledon's financial problems, the FA set a deadline of 31 May 2002 for the commission's \"final and binding\" verdict, and released a press statement on 10 May inviting anyone interested to send written submissions care of the FA. By this time, the fans' matchday publication Yellow and Blue was outselling the official Wimbledon F.C. programme by three to one."]}, {"page": "Stride, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve Stride"]}]}}
