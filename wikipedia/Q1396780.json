She was born and grew up in Somerset, and spent half of her childhood in Glastonbury, and the other half in a small farming village on the edge of the Somerset Levels. She had a mixed education, and ended up attending art college for a year before moving to London. A first career culminated in working as a Production Assistant then Producer in TV commercials for directors including Ridley and Tony Scott. She gave it up to spend a year in Spain with her boyfriend Dominic, who remains her partner. She returned pregnant. She attended the University of Southampton as a mature student. Only after the birth of her second son in 1995 she started to write seriously.Having taught adult students wanting to return to education when her children where young, she later decided to use her teaching skills to work with marginalised communities, including recovering addicts, mental health service users, gypsies and, in Labrador, aboriginal peoples. She taught and mentored creative writing and performance, focusing on developing skills and self-esteem, and, always, the writer's own original voice. In 2018 she founded The Outsiders Project a company giving voice to the unheard.\nShe spent 3 years on the Management Committee for the Society of Authors, and is on the Advisory Board of the Alpine Fellowship. In 2018 she became a trustee of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, and is now Deputy Chair underneath Margaret Caseley-Hayford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "River Parrett", "response": ["From January until May, the Parrett provides a source of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as this is the only legal means of catching them.

The 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale contains a small homage where James Bond pursues a female character through Venice, catching glimpses of her through the crowds wearing a red dress. The Belgium set thriller, In Bruges, starring Colin Farrell, includes a number of explicit references; director Martin McDonagh said that the \"Venice of Don't Look Now\" was the template for the depiction of Bruges in his film, and the film includes numerous thematic similarities, including one character stating that the film she is working on is a \"pastiche of Don't Look Now\". Flatliners, a 1990 supernatural thriller directed by Joel Schumacher, also draws explicitly on the red-coated childlike figure by having a character terrorised by a child wearing a red coat; coincidentally, the character who is being tormented is played by Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland's son.  In the 2007 stage play of Don't Look Now, written by Nell Leyshon and directed by Lucy Bailey, the play made a conscious effort to bypass the film and be a faithful adaptation of du Maurier's short story, but it did however retain the iconic red mac from the film as worn by the elusive childlike figure."]}, {"page": "Leyshon", "response": ["* Nell Leyshon, British playwright and novelist"]}, {"page": "Not After Midnight, and Other Stories", "response": ["The story \"Don't Look Now\" has been adapted in several media: a 1973 film directed by Nicolas Roeg; a 2001 BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial by Ronald Frame; and a 2007 stage play by Nell Leyshon."]}, {"page": "Stephen McAnena", "response": ["He wrote the short film The Good Son (1998), nominated for the Critics' Week Award at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.
