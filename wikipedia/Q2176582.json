However, in 2003, George was granted, by Warrant of Precedence from Queen Elizabeth II, the style and precedence that would have been his, had his father survived to inherit the barony, becoming The Honourable George Ponsonby. Precedence in such circumstances is usually granted but is not automatic."]}, {"page": "Rupert (name)", "response": ["* Rupert Ponsonby, 7th Baron de Mauley (born 1957), British hereditary peer, Member of the House of Lords"]}, {"page": "List of barons in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["#*Rupert Ponsonby, 7th Baron de Mauley"]}, {"page": "Earl of Bessborough", "response": ["The baronies Ponsonby of Shulbrede and de Mauley are in the remainder for the earldom of Bessborough.
