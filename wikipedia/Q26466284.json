They performed with this line-up until December that year, when Frith, Hodgkinson and Powell split off from the rest of the group and became a trio. Powell at the time was studying music at King's College under Roger Smalley, the resident composer. Smalley was influential in Henry Cow's early development. He exposed them to a variety of new music from bands and musicians like Soft Machine, Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa. Smalley also introduced them to the idea of writing long and complex musical pieces for rock groups. It was at this time that Henry Cow began writing music to challenge their collective ability to play, then using it to improve on themselves.", "*David Attwooll \u2013 drums (1968)", "  bar:Attwooll     text:David Attwooll"]}, {"page": "1949 in jazz", "response": ["* 22 \u2013 David Attwooll, British drummer, poet, and publisher, Henry Cow (died 2016)."]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**David Attwooll, 67, poet and publisher."]}, {"page": "2016 in jazz", "response": ["* 5 \u2013 David Attwooll, British drummer, poet, and publisher, Henry Cow (born 1949)."]}, {"page": "List of years in jazz", "response": ["* 2016 in jazz, deaths of Al Caiola, Alan Haven, Alfredo \"Chocolate\" Armenteros, Alonzo Levister, Alphonse Mouzon, Bernie Worrell, Betty Loo Taylor, Bhumibol Adulyadej, Bill Henderson, Billy Paul, Bob Cranshaw, Bobby Hutcherson, Bobby Wellins, Buckwheat Zydeco, Buster Cooper, Candye Kane, Charles Davis, Charles Thompson, Carlos Averhoff, Carlton Kitto, Chuck Flores, Claude Williamson, Connie Crothers, Dave Shepherd, David Attwooll, David Baker, Dennis Davis, Derek Smith, Dominic Duval, Don Francks, Don Friedman, Doug Raney, Ernestine Anderson, Frank Sinatra Jr., Fred N\u00f8ddelund, Fredrik Nor\u00e9n, Gato Barbieri, Getatchew Mekurya, Greg Lake, Guilherme Franco, Harald Devold, Hod O'Brien, Horacio Salg\u00e1n, Hubert Giraud, Irving Fields, Ivar Thomassen, Janusz Muniak, Jeremy Steig, Joe Ascione, Joe Temperley, Johannes Bauer, John Chilton, John Fischer, Jon Klette, Karel R\u016f\u017ei\u010dka, Kay Starr, Keith Emerson, Knut Kiesewetter, L\u00e9o Marjane, Leon Russell, Long John Hunter, Louis Smith, Louis Stewart, Mariano Mores, Maurice White, Michael Di Pasqua, Michael White, Mike Daniels, Mike Pedicin, Mose Allison, Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos, Papa Wemba, Pat Friday, Paul Bley, Pete Fountain, Pete Yellin, Peter Appleyard, Pocho La Pantera, Prince Rogers Nelson, Randy Jones, Roger Cicero, Roland Prince, Rudy Van Gelder, Ryo Fukui, Sel\u00e7uk Sun, Shelley Moore, Shirley Bunnie Foy, Steve Byrd, Terje Fj\u00e6rn, Toots Thielemans, Victor Bailey, Willy Andresen, and Zena Latto.", "* 1949 in jazz, deaths of Albert Ammons, Bud Scott, Bunk Johnson, Buster Wilson, Danny Polo, George Baquet, Herbie Haymer, Irving Fazola, Ivie Anderson, Kid Rena, Louis Nelson Delisle, Paul Mares, Seymour Simons, and Snoozer Quinn; births of Allan C.
