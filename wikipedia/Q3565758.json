The senior Speche is believed to have become the feudal Baron of Old Wardon by 1086.In the years up to 1120, Espec controlled northern England, alongside Eustace Fitz John. He was the builder of Helmsley Castle; he built also Wark Castle. As an old man, when High Sheriff of Yorkshire, he fought against the Scots at the Battle of the Standard in 1138. He was the founder of Kirkham Priory (Augustinians) and later Rievaulx Abbey (Cistercians). Kirkham Priory was founded around 1130. He then donated 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) to Rievaulx, where building started in 1132, and is largely credited for the arrival of the Cistercians in England. By 1135 he also founded Warden Abbey (Wardon) in Bedfordshire, a daughter house of Rievaulx. Walter Espec later became a Cistercian monk himself.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1153", "response": ["* Walter Espec, Norman nobleman and High Sheriff"]}, {"page": "Cistercians", "response": ["In Yorkshire, Rievaulx Abbey was founded from Clairvaux in 1131, on a small, isolated property donated by Walter Espec, with the support of Thurstan, Archbishop of York.

It was from Rievaulx that a foundation was made at  Melrose, which became the earliest Cistercian monastery in Scotland.

Monastic chroniclers often deplore depredations made by foreign armies and sometimes even those of their own rulers(two contemporary examples are Orderic Vitalis on the Harrying of the North by William the Conqueror and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle on the Anarchy ) but some Scots forces were going beyond normal Norman 'harrying' by systematically carrying off women and children as slaves. \"Remember what they did in the lands across the Tyne, and hope for nothing gentler if the Scots conquer. I am silent about the slaughter, the rapine, the fires that the enemy employed in something like a human way.  I would tell such acts as no stories tell and no histories relate of the fiercest tyrants.  I would tell them, I say, if words did not fail before such horror, or the listener flee.

They advanced to Thirsk, from where they sent Robert de Brus and Bernard de Balliol (recently arrived with a few mercenaries sent by King Stephen) on an embassy to David, whose army was now approaching the River Tees and North Yorkshire.", "Both Ailred and Henry of Huntingdon report a speech made to the Anglo-Normans before battle was joined.   The speech may well be a literary device of the chroniclers, to present the reasons why it was fit and proper that the Normans should win, rather than accurate reportage of an actual speech.  Ailred of Rievaulx says the speech was made by Walter Espec, Sheriff of York (and founder of Rievaulx).  Henry of Huntingdon and after him Roger of Hoveden say the speech was made by Radulf Novell Bishop of Orkney as the representative of Thurstan.The underlying themes are essentially the same, but are handled somewhat differently. Ailred's version of the speech is substantially longer, and the extracts given below are therefore from Roger of Hoveden's version.", "The speaker first reminds the Normans of the military prowess of their race (especially when compared to the Scots): \"Most illustrious nobles of England, Normans by birth, ... consider who you are, and against whom, and where it is, you are waging war; for then no one shall with impunity resist your prowess. Bold France, taught by experience, has quailed beneath your valour, fierce England, led captive, has submitted to you; rich Apulia, on having you for her masters, has flourished once again; Jerusalem so famed, and illustrious Antioch, have bowed themselves before you; and now Scotland, which of right is subject to you,The Normans held that in William the Conqueror's time the King of Scotland had done homage to him, and subsequent Kings of Scotland had served on the campaigns of the King England when summoned.  Aelred has Walter Espec be slightly more specific: Who then would not laugh, rather than fear, when to fight against such men runs the worthless Scot with half-bare buttocks ? They are those, they are only those who of yore thought not to oppose us, but to yield, when William conqueror of England penetrated Lothian, Calatria and Scotland as far as Abernethy, where the warlike Malcolm was made ours by his surrender   attempts to show resistance, displaying a temerity not warranted by her arms, more fitted indeed for rioting than for battle. These are people, in fact, who have no knowledge of military matters, no skill in fighting, no moderation in ruling. There is no room then left for fear, but rather for shame, that those whom we have always sought on their own soil and overcome ..have ...come flocking into our country.\"", "On 26 September Cardinal Alberic, bishop of Ostia, arrived at Carlisle where David had called together his kingdom's nobles, abbots and bishops. Alberic was there as a papal legate to resolve a long-running dispute as to whether the bishop of Glasgow was subordinate to the archbishop of York. However, Alberic also addressed more temporal matters: he persuaded David to refrain from further offensive action until Martinmas (11 November) whilst continuing to blockade Wark to starve it into submission, and the 'Picts' to (also by Martinmas) return their captives to Carlisle and free them there.Richard of Hexham, Anderson Scottish Annals (1908) p 211-212.  Richard also reports that, The king also spoke with the prior of Hexham, who had come thither with the legate, before [the prior] had appealed to him, concerning the loss sustained by him and by his brethren; and deplored it much, and promised that he would cause the whole to be restored : and moreover that he would compel his men to compensate them for the wrong which had been done to them and to their church, and for the slaying of their vassals. And this in great part he did. For both their money and that of their vassals was almost wholly returned.   At Martinmas, the garrison of Wark surrendered on the orders of the castle's owner (Walter Espec), conveyed by the abbot of Rievaulx.  The garrison had eaten all but two of their horses; King David rehorsed them and allowed them to depart with their arms.A beau geste in recognition of their stout defence of Wark, presumably.  The chroniclers say he provided 24 horses, and the usual deduction from this is that there were 24 mounted men in the garrison. (Richard of Hexham, Anderson Scottish Annals (1908)p 213) Norham the neighbouring castle and whose garrison \u2013 provided by the Bishop of Durham \u2013 included only nine knights was felt to have been both under-garrisonned, and too readily surrendered (Richard of Hexham, Anderson Scottish Annals (1908) p 188) \"Under Henry II a standard price [of horses] appears to have been \u00a32\" Prestwich, Michael, Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages, page 34", "* Baker, D., Aelred of Rievaulx and Walter Espec p 91-98 in Haskins Society Journal 1989, 1"]}, {"page": "Helmsley", "response": ["The ancient settlement, whose Old English name was Elmeslac, pre-dates the Domesday Book.
