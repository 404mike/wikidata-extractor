In January 2005, he moved to Liverpool for a \u00a3750,000 fee and was called up for the England senior team later that year. He made nine appearances for Liverpool, including the UEFA Champions League quarter-final victory over Juventus in April 2005, before going on loan to Sheffield Wednesday, Charlton Athletic and Aston Villa in successive seasons to gain experience. After his return to Liverpool from his loan spell at Aston Villa at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, he joined West Bromwich Albion for a \u00a33.25 million fee in July 2008. In 2011, he moved to Bursaspor of Turkey. After two years in Turkey, he moved back to England with Wigan Athletic, where he remained until 2015 when he signed for Derby County. Carson joined reigning Premier League champions Manchester City on loan in August 2019 to provide cover for Ederson and Claudio Bravo. He signed permanently for Manchester City in 2021.\nCarson made his first appearance for the England under-21 team in the same month and later set a record of 29 caps for the under-21 team.

However, Scott Carson was chosen ahead of both James and Robinson for the decisive Euro 2008 qualifier against Croatia on 21 November 2007. England lost the match 2-3, partly due to a fumble by Carson, which gifted Croatia the game's opening goal. Following England's failure to qualify for Euro 2008 McClaren was sacked as England manager and replaced by Fabio Capello.

He was substituted at half-time and replaced by David James, although then England manager Steve McClaren said he planned to make this substitution before the match. Despite this error, Robinson was still the number one goalkeeper, featuring in four further European Championship qualifiers, and keeping a clean sheet in three of them. He made another mistake, however, in a 2\u20131 defeat against Russia: Robinson palmed a shot into the path of Russian forward Roman Pavlyuchenko, resulting in the striker scoring Russia's winning goal. As a result, McClaren dropped Robinson for the final qualifying match against Croatia in November, replacing him with Scott Carson.
