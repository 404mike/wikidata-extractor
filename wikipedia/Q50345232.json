She was previously political director and south-east England regional secretary for Unite the Union.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeremy Corbyn", "response": ["An internal Labour Party report, entitled The work of the Labour Party's Governance and Legal Unit in relation to antisemitism, 2014\u20132019, which was leaked to the media in April 2020, stated that Corbyn's team inherited a lack of \"robust processes, systems, training, education and effective line management\" as well as factional hostility towards Corbyn amongst former senior officials. This contributed to \"a litany of mistakes\" which \"affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints\". The investigation, which was completed in March 2020, concluded there was \"no evidence\" of antisemitism complaints being treated differently to other forms of complaint, or of current or former staff being \"motivated by antisemitic intent\". It was later reported in the Guardian that the Labour Party's most senior lawyer had said that the report was deliberately misleading. The report also stated that Corbyn's office was not made aware of the scale of the antisemitism problem in the party because former General Secretary Iain McNicol, and other senior figures provided \"false and misleading information\" to his office. It found that McNicol and staff in the Governance and Legal Unit \"provided timetables for the resolution of cases that were never met; falsely claimed to have processed all antisemitism complaints; falsely claimed that most complaints received were not about Labour members and provided highly inaccurate statistics of antisemitism complaints\". The report also stated Sam Matthews, who was Head of Disputes and acting Head of the Governance and Legal Unit, \"rarely replied or took any action\" in relation to antisemitism complaints. It said the process for tackling antisemitism complaints improved when Jennie Formby became general secretary in 2018."]}, {"page": "Tom Watson (Labour politician)", "response": ["In July 2019, Watson was criticised by Labour's General Secretary Jennie Formby for being irresponsible in criticising Labour's handling of antisemitism claims. Formby said he risked exacerbating fears in the Jewish community and that, while antisemitism was a real problem, steps had been taken to tackle it. Watson had asked for a copy of the party response to a request by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to be released to the Shadow Cabinet and the NEC, which Formby said she had already offered sight of to Watson (she did not address the subject of releasing it to the rest of the Shadow Cabinet and NEC), and had previously asked to be copied in on individual complaints, which had data protection issues. In response to Watson's claim that the party's response to the Panorama programme Is Labour Anti-Semitic had \"smeared\" the former Labour staff members and \"breached all common standards of decency\", Formby stated that all current Labour staff members had access to an \"Employee Assistance Programme\" but said the party was not made aware of the distress suffered by staff members at the time and she was \"very concerned\" to hear about it for the first time in the Panorama documentary. Watson was also criticised for attacking Formby when she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer."]}]}}
