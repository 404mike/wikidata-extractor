He was to become not only the first Gibraltarian Manager but the youngest at 33. During his 23 years at the helm of the Rock Hotel, James Bossino saw the expansion of the hotel with an extra wing built to the north of the property along with two extra floors, two penthouse suites and a conference room.  He then led the hotel through the very difficult economic and social siege that was the closed frontier period between 1969 and 1982/84 by successfully steering the institution that was the Rock Hotel. He also recruited, at the time, the very loyal Moroccan workforce. Some of his team continue to work there to this day.  He later went on to launch a second major refurbishment in 1987. James Bossino retired from the Rock Hotel in 1994.
