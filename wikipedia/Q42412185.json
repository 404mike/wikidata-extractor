She was jailed for demonstrating for women's rights. She followed Emmeline Pankhurst's lead as she became more militant (and lost former colleagues). Her home was known as \"Mouse Castle\" because it looked after recovering hunger strikers. The house now has a plaque which remembers the trio of her sister, her mother and Maria. She was the younger sister of Georgina Brackenbury, also a painter and militant suffragette.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Georgina Brackenbury", "response": ["Brackenbury was born at Royal Military Academy in Woolwich where her father Major General Charles Booth Brackenbury who had been a Times correspondent before he was wounded was Director of the artillery college.Lloyd, E.

A year after the Women's Parliament she was involved with the audacious \"pantechnicon raid\". This was where a furniture van (pantechnicon) was used as a \"Trojan Horse\" to get twenty suffragettes to the House of Commons. When they were close, Haig, Maria Brackenbury, Georgina Brackenbury joined the rest who tried to rush their way into the lobby. Haig was arrested together with the Brackenburys. They received six-week sentences. Haig said on her release that it was'wonderful how each woman who acts influences their own circle. Friends who before may have been but mildly in favour, are converted into active and eager workers for the cause. Coming out is so delightful that the stupidity of the time in Holloway is forgotten'."]}]}}
