Marches of the unemployed, generally termed \"hunger marches\", had been taking place since the early 1920s, often under the auspices of the communist-led National Unemployed Workers' Movement. This political dimension had associated such marches in the public mind with far-left propaganda.Bartley, p. 88. The Jarrow council determined to organise its march free of political connotations, and with the backing of every section of the town. This did not prevent Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham, from denouncing it as \"revolutionary mob pressure\"  and condemning the action of James Gordon, the Bishop of Jarrow, who gave the march his blessing.Bartley, p. 89.
