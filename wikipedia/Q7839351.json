The sport suffered a split with the BDO's top players forming a new governing body called the World Darts Council (later known as the Professional Darts Corporation). With the big names gone, Sharp was one of those who took advantage. After beating Trevor Nurse in the first round, he defeated Roland Scholten, the only seed to progress through round one in the second round. He then beat Denmark's Troels Rusel in the quarter finals before losing to Canada's John Part 5\u20131 in sets. Sharp was the only player to win a set against eventual champion Part in the entire tournament. Sharp did not progress further in his career, reaching only the second round in the 1995 World Championship and then quietly disappeared from the scene.  He did appear on TV's Bullseye (UK game show) series 13 where he achieved a score of 328. Due to it being 301 or more, the programme doubled this amount to \u00a3656 which was given to the contestants' chosen charity, the Kent Air Ambulance Air Appeal."]}, {"page": "Nurse (surname)", "response": ["*Trevor Nurse (1965\u20132016), Scottish darts player"]}]}}
