In 1913 he,\u00a0Sidney Ball\u00a0and\u00a0A. L.

Barnett House was formally opened on 6 June 1914, when Horace Plunkett, who was visiting Adams,\u00a0spoke on the need for research into rural matters.Letter, Adams to Plunkett, 2 December 1913, Sir Horace Plunkett Papers (Correspondence),\u00a0National Library of Ireland, MS49,803/2. The original idea for Barnett House came from Rev. (later Bishop)\u00a0George Bell,\u00a0Adams taking it up enthusiastically and involving Sidney Ball and others in progressing it: Helena Deneke,\u00a0Grace Hadow\u00a0(OUP, 1946), pp. 88-89. Besides\u00a0becoming an important resource for the University, the House provided a range of services to Oxfordshire\u2019s rural communities, including circulating books to schools and village halls in outlying districts."]}]}}
