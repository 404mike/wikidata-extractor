Leighton started his career with Aberdeen, where he won seven domestic trophies and the 1982-83 European Cup Winners' Cup under the management of Alex Ferguson. Ferguson then signed Leighton for Manchester United in 1988, but dropped him after he conceded three goals in the 1990 FA Cup Final. Leighton then had spells with Arsenal, Reading, Dundee and Sheffield United, and rebuilt his career after joining Hibernian in 1993. He returned to Aberdeen in 1997, leading to a career total of over 600 appearances in the league alone.\nLeighton played in 91 international matches for Scotland. He was chosen for Scotland's World Cup squads in 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1998, playing in the latter three of those tournaments.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 24", "response": ["*1958 \u2013 Jim Leighton, Scottish footballer and coach"]}, {"page": "Alex Ferguson", "response": ["In the 1987\u201388 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including Steve Bruce, Viv Anderson, Brian McClair and Jim Leighton. The new players made a positive contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly still some way to go before United could be a match for their north western rivals.", "Following a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup. Forest were performing well that season and were in the process of winning the League Cup for the second season running, and it was expected that United would lose the match and Ferguson would consequently be sacked, but United won the game 1\u20130 due to a Mark Robins goal and eventually reached the final. This cup win is often cited as the match that saved Ferguson's Old Trafford career, even though it has since been stated that his job was never at risk. United went on to win the FA Cup, beating Crystal Palace 1\u20130 in the final replay after a 3\u20133 draw in the first match, giving Ferguson his first major trophy as Manchester United manager. United's defensive frailties in the first match were blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton. Ferguson dropped Leighton for the replay, bringing in Les Sealey."]}, {"page": "1998 FIFA World Cup", "response": ["The average age of all teams was 27 years, 8 months \u2013 five months older than the previous tournament.

Players such as Jim Leighton, Willie Miller, Alex McLeish and Gordon Strachan became the backbone of the team.

When Ferguson left in 1986 to go to Manchester United, he tried to get McLeish to sign, but it did not work out; he also had talks with Tottenham Hotspur. A testimonial match was arranged for McLeish in December 1988, with the club's 'Gothenburg' (Cup Winners' Cup) squad taking on an 'International legends' team.

Goram made his debut in that game on 16 October 1985, coming on in the second half as a substitute for Jim Leighton. In the run up to the 1986 FIFA World Cup Goram played the full 90 minutes in friendly matches against Romania and the Netherlands, keeping clean sheets in both games. Goram travelled to Mexico in the summer 1986 as a member of Scotland's World Cup squad, although he was third choice behind Leighton and Alan Rough and did not play in any of Scotland's three games.", "Jim Leighton remained first-choice goalkeeper for Scotland in their qualifying campaigns for Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup, with Goram as his understudy. Goram only played one competitive game during this time; a 1\u20131 home draw against Yugoslavia in October 1988 during the qualifiers for the 1990 World Cup. He did play in several friendly matches, and was in the Scotland squad that took part in the 1990 World Cup in Italy, although once again he did not actually play in games there.", "Scotland failed to build on their showing at Euro 1992 in the qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup. A poor campaign, which included a humiliating 5\u20130 defeat away against Portugal in April 1993, saw Scotland slump to fourth place in their group and fail to qualify. The match against Portugal was Goram's last Scotland appearance for almost a year due to him undergoing knee surgery and a lengthy return to fitness. He returned to the side in March 1994, playing in a friendly against The Netherlands, and played in a 2\u20130 win away against Finland on 7 September 1994 in the opening qualifying tie for Euro 1996. Goram kept his place in the side and played in Scotland's next three qualifying ties. However, in August 1995 days before a qualifying match against Greece, Goram withdrew from the squad stating that he was not \"mentally attuned\" to play. Jim Leighton played against Greece and kept his place in the team for the remaining two qualifying matches, although Goram did play for the last 17 minutes of a friendly match against Sweden in between those final two ties.", "He had a long-running rivalry with Jim Leighton for the goalkeeping position in the Scotland team. Craig Brown controversially selected Goram ahead of Leighton for Scotland's matches in Euro 96, despite the fact that Leighton had played in most of the qualifiers. Goram justified his selection with an excellent showing at the tournament. He was solid throughout in the opening 0\u20130 draw against The Netherlands, including an excellent save to deny Clarence Seedorf. Although Scotland dominated their final game against Switzerland, Goram was left increasingly exposed as his teammates chased forward in search of the second goal needed to progress from the group. As such, he was required to make several important saves, notably when he clawed away a header from Kubilay Turkyilmaz in the final ten minutes. Brown then selected Leighton for France 98, which prompted Goram to walk out of the squad completely, 15 days before Scotland were scheduled to play Brazil in the opening game of the World Cup."]}, {"page": "David Weir (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["On 24 August 2010, Weir was recalled to the Scotland squad at the age of 40 for the Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Lithuania and Liechtenstein in September 2010.
