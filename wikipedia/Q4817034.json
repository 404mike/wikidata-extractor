In the mid-1980s the group adopted Livingstone as something of a figurehead, regarding Arthur Scargill and Tony Benn as spent forces, and according to Atma Singh was \"instrumental\" in getting Livingstone elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee in 1987 and 1988.", "Running as an independent candidate for Mayor in 2000, Livingstone's decision to appoint members of Socialist Action to his administration during his first term drew criticism in the media. When Livingstone re-appointed his administration in 2004, members of Socialist Action were described as his \"stooges\". In a January 2008 article that was subsequently spun as revealing a \"secret Marxist cell\" at the GLA, Atma Singh, a former member of SA who had been Policy Advisor on Asian Affairs to Ken Livingstone from 2001 to 2007, detailed some of the history and activities of Socialist Action, accusing members of planning a \"bourgeois democratic revolution\", trying to accumulate power and manipulating the Mayor.Atma Singh, The Times, 19 January 2008 Atma Singh's full article on Ken Livingstone A subsequent episode of the Channel 4 documentary series Dispatches, \"The Court of Ken\", presented by journalist Martin Bright, featured Singh and others making these same allegations.\"The Court of Ken\" Part 1 of 5, YouTube The advisers named, including chief of staff Simon Fletcher, deputy chief of staff and director of public affairs and transport Redmond O'Neill, economic adviser John Ross, green adviser Mark Watts and culture adviser Jude Woodward, refused to state whether or not they are still active as Socialist Action, and a spokesman for Livingstone responded to the charges by referring to Singh's removal from his job for \"failure to discharge his duties\" and calling Singh \"an embittered ex-employee\". Livingstone referred to the claims in the Dispatches documentary as a hatchet job.", "Following Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour Party leader and Leader of the Opposition in 2015, it was claimed (by former member Atma Singh) that Socialist Action were building \"a real power base\" around Corbyn.

Supporters described him as the \"People's Ken\" and an \"anti-politician politician\", opining that he had the common touch with working-class Londoners that most British politicians lacked. He was widely recognised for having improved the status of minority groups in London. He was also deemed a \"formidable operator\" at City Hall, with an \"intimate knowledge\" of London. He was also criticised during his career. During his Mayorship, he faced repeated accusations of cronyism for favouring his chosen aides over other staff. One of his supporters, Atma Singh, commented that under Livingstone's leadership, a culture of bullying pervaded at City Hall, although this was denied by many other staff there."]}, {"page": "Atma Singh, Pakistan", "response": ["Atma Singh is a village in the Punjab province of Pakistan."]}, {"page": "List of British Sikhs", "response": ["*Atma Singh \u2013 Policy Advisor to the Mayor of London on Asian Affairs in the Greater London Authority, under Mayor of London Ken Livingstone"]}, {"page": "List of British Punjabis", "response": ["*Atma Singh \u2013 policy advisor to the Mayor of London on Asian Affairs in the Greater London Authority, under Ken Livingstone"]}]}}
