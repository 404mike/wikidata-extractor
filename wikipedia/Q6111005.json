M. Andrews, he was educated at Moure Grange Preparatory School, County Down, and Shrewsbury School. Andrews entered Parliament as MP for Mid Down in 1953 (replacing his father), a seat which he represented until his resignation in 1964, when he was elected to the Senate where he sat until the Parliament was prorogued in 1972. His election to the senate was following a cabinet reshuffle, in which Andrews accepted demotion to the politically unimportant position of Government Minister in the Senate.\nHe held several Cabinet positions, including Minister in the Senate from 1964 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 1969. He was a contender for the position of Prime Minister on the retirement of Lord Brookeborough, but when it became clear that Terence O'Neill had a comfortable lead over both Andrews and Brian Faulkner in the parliamentary party, no contest was held. In 1969 he was approached by O'Neill to succeed him, but he refused and James Chichester-Clark was elected\nDuring the 1970 Bannside and South Antrim by-elections, Andrews was at the centre of the UUP's pluralist campaign against Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party, declaring \"What does Protestant Unionism mean? Does it mean that you have to put a sign over the door of the Unionist Party saying Protestants only?\"\nAndrews was knighted in 1973. In retirement, he served as President of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ulster Unionist Party", "response": ["Lord Brookeborough, despite having felt that Craigavon had held on to power for too long, was Prime Minister for one year longer. During this time he was on more than one occasion called to meetings of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland to explain his actions, most notably following the 1947 Education Act which made the government responsible for the payment of National Insurance contributions of teachers in Catholic Church-controlled schools. Ian Paisley called for Brookeborough's resignation in 1953 when he refused to sack Brian Maginess and Clarence Graham, who had given speeches supporting re-admitting Catholics to the UUP. He retired in 1963 and was replaced by Terence O'Neill, who emerged ahead of other candidates, Jack Andrews and Faulkner."]}, {"page": "James Chichester-Clark", "response": ["In April 1970 his predecessor and another Unionist MP resigned their seats in the NI House of Commons. The by-election campaigns were punctuated by major liberal speeches by senior government figures like Brian Faulkner, Jack Andrews and the Prime Minister himself. Ian Paisley's Protestant Unionist Party, however, took both seats in the House of Commons. Later the same month the O'Neill-ite group, the New Ulster Movement, became the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, and his party began passing votes of no confidence in him."]}, {"page": "Irish cabinets since 1919", "response": ["|Jack Andrews", "|Jack Andrews", "|Jack Andrews"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors of Northern Ireland", "response": ["| Jack Andrews"]}, {"page": "Privy Council of Northern Ireland", "response": ["* Jack Andrews"]}, {"page": "John Lawson Ormrod Andrews", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Andrews"]}, {"page": "Andrews (surname)", "response": ["* Jack Andrews (1898\u20131974), English footballer", "* Jack Andrews (1903\u20131986), Northern Ireland politician, son of J.

On O'Neill's resignation following the inconclusive result of the 1969 general election, the division of support within the Parliamentary Party was such that an election was required to choose the new leader.", "It had initially been assumed that Faulkner would win the contest, however many within the Parliamentary Party were determined that a hardliner such as Faulkner should not be leader.  Jack Andrews, leader of the Senate, came under pressure from many including O'Neill, to stand, however he refused.  In His memoirs, Kenneth Bloomfield suggests that Chichester-Clark's resignation from the cabinet which precipitated O'Neill's own resignation, had been a ploy to deprive Faulkner.  In his own memoirs, Faulkner claims that it was a matter of class distinction, where the upper classes had conspired to keep the Premiership out of middle class hands.  Following his headline grabbing resignation, and O'Neill's endorsement in the absence of Andrews candidature, Chichester-Clark was expected to win by a clear margin and the close result came as a great surprise.  O'Neill voted for his distant cousin, and also used his casting vote in his favour. It has been said that he favoured Chichester-Clark not due to their distant family links, but as Faulkner had been stabbing him in the back for longer.Walker, G, A History of the Ulster Unionist Party, 2004)"]}, {"page": "Leader of the Senate of Northern Ireland", "response": ["The Leader of the Senate of Northern Ireland was the Leader of the House in the Senate of Northern Ireland.
