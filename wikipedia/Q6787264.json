My own work, because I\u2019ve written it, touches every one of my hot buttons.\" She currently lives in Brighton and has two children.Her novel The Silver Crown was subjected to legal scrutiny when Pelican Bay State Prison, California withheld a copy from an inmate convicted of attempted murder, Andres Martinez, on grounds that the book was \"obscene and likely to incite violence\" and contained \"descriptions of explicit sexual conduct.\" In May 2013, an appeals court affirmed the prisoner's right to read the book.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Virgin Books", "response": ["* Black Lace specializes in erotica and erotic romance written by female authors specifically for heterosexual female readers.
