The most popular point to commence a direct ascent is Dalnaspidal Lodge () where there is lay-by parking. The flat area around the lodge is quite boggy and is prone to flooding after wet weather due to presence of a sluice dam. The route goes straight up the SE flanks of the hill which are its least steep. The start at Dalnaspidal gives the opportunity to climb The Sow along with the Corbett Meall na Leitreach which lies five km to the south across Loch Garry.\"The Corbett Almanac\", Cameron McNeish,  Page 56 Suggests hill can be climbed with Meall na Leit reach. Another possible starting point is 2.5\u00a0km further north on the A9 at the summit of the Pass of Drumochter although the climb from here is steeper. The Sow can be climbed as part of a round of Coire Dhomhain, taking in the other Munros of  Sgairneach Mh\u00f2r, Beinn Udlamain and A' Mharconaich. The top of the hill is marked by a small cairn made up of a few rocks.

A Highland councillor commented in 2019 that visitors tended to stay in the area for only one night when using the route, in contrast with stays of several nights before it opened. In 2017, writer and broadcaster Cameron McNeish questioned the promotion of the route, given that the Scottish Government had adopted strong positions on climate change and renewable energy: \"Should we really be promoting the idea of people driving petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles for 500 miles around the north of Scotland?\""]}, {"page": "Scottish National Trail", "response": ["Created by walker Cameron McNeish, it is the first walking route to run the length of Scotland.
