After a brief period as a chorus member in an opera company he was appointed organist of a chapel in south London, later moving to more prestigious organ posts at St Luke's Church, Chelsea and finally St Paul's Cathedral, where he struggled to improve musical standards.\nAs a composer, Goss wrote little for the orchestra, but was known for his vocal music, both religious and secular. Among his best-known compositions are his hymn tunes \"Praise, my soul, the King of heaven\" and \"See, Amid the Winter's Snow\". The music critic of The Times described him as the last of the line of English composers who confined themselves almost entirely to ecclesiastical music.\nFrom 1827 to 1874, Goss was a professor at the Royal Academy of Music, teaching harmony. He also taught at St Paul's. Among his pupils at the academy were Arthur Sullivan, Frederic Cowen and Frederick Bridge. His best-known pupil at St Paul's was John Stainer, who succeeded him as organist there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Sullivan", "response": ["In 1856 the Royal Academy of Music awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship to the 14-year-old Sullivan, granting him a year's training at the academy.

He was already an accomplished player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch and a fine treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 he was invited to sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there than he would have done had he been educated at the local elementary school.Dibble, pps. 11\u201312. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. At this time he might have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years. Certainly the two young men later became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays.Dibble, p. 34. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of \u00a330 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.Dibble, p. 36."]}, {"page": "List of Christmas carols", "response": ["|words: Edward Caswall, music: John Goss"]}, {"page": "I was glad", "response": ["*Part of the text commencing \"O pray for the peace of Jerusalem\" has been set by Thomas Tomkins, John Blow, John Goss (1879), Herbert Howells (1933)."]}, {"page": "Sir John Goss", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Goss (composer)"]}, {"page": "List of Anglican church composers", "response": ["*John Goss"]}, {"page": "Glee (music)", "response": ["* John Goss"]}, {"page": "Thomas Attwood (composer)", "response": ["He was himself the teacher of John Goss, Cipriani Potter, his godson Thomas Attwood Walmisley, and child prodigy Elizabeth Jonas.Gatens 2009, p. 84 Through his friendship with Mendelssohn, he greatly encouraged the young William Sterndale BennettSterndale Bennett, JR 1907 pp.18,25,31 The Life of William Sterndale Bennett"]}, {"page": "Frederic Hymen Cowen", "response": ["At the age of four years Frederic was brought to England, where his father became treasurer to the opera at Her Majesty's Opera, now Her Majesty's Theatre, and private secretary to William Humble Ward, 11th Lord Ward (1817\u20131885).

His first public appearance as a pianist was as an accompanist in one of his own early songs sung by Mrs Drayton at a concert in Brighton in the early 1860s. His first genuine public recital was given on 17 December 1863 at the Bijou Theatre of the old Her Majesty's Opera House, and in the following year he performed Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto in D minor at a concert given at Dudley House, Park Lane, the London home of the Earl of Dudley.

By coincidence the second competition for the Mendelssohn Scholarship was due to be held that gave its winner three years of tuition at the Leipzig Conservatorium. Cowen attended the examination and won the prize, but his parents intervened, as they were not prepared to give up control of him, as stipulated by the terms of the prize. Instead, they agreed to send him to the same institution, but as an independent student. Charles Swinnerton Heap was awarded the prize in his place. At Leipzig, overseen by Ernst Friedrich Eduard Richter, Cowen studied under Moritz Hauptmann (harmony and counterpoint), Ignaz Moscheles (piano), Carl Reinecke (composition) and Ferdinand David (ensemble work).Winston James Baltzell, Complete History of Music.
