He served with the Durham Light Infantry in the First World War. He was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield in County Durham at the 1931 general election, defeating the Labour Party MP John Herriotts. Jennings was defeated at the 1935 general election by Labour's John Leslie. He is the last Conservative to serve as Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency until Paul Howell in 2019\nAfter losing the Wandsworth Central seat in a 1937 byelection, Jennings returned to the House of Commons in 1939, when he was elected as MP for Sheffield Hallam at a by-election following the death of Sir Louis William Smith. At this and each subsequent election he fought as a 'Conservative and Liberal' although he took the Conservative whip.In 1955, Jennings was caught up in a minor constitutional difficulty when shortly after the general election a political opponent highlighted the fact that he had been, since 1923, a public auditor approved by the Treasury. He had taken the post solely in order to audit the books of the Cotherstone British Legion and Village Club, but there were circumstances in which he might have been paid by the Treasury: this would make it an \"office of profit under the Crown\" and therefore a disqualification from being elected.The matter was referred by the House of Commons to a Select Committee which reported that Jennings was indeed disqualified under the law as it stood. The government rushed through Parliament a Bill changing the law, and another bill indemnifying Jennings from the consequences of acting as an MP while disqualified and validating his election. Several other MPs were similarly found to have been unknowingly disqualified in an ensuing investigation.\nJennings retired from Parliament at the 1959 general election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Roland Jennings "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Roland Jennings"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Roland Jennings"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Roland Jennings"]}, {"page": "Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Roland Jennings"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Roland Jennings"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Roland Jennings"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|Roland Jennings"]}, {"page": "John Leslie (politician)", "response": ["He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sedgefield in County Durham at the 1935 general election, defeating the Conservative Party MP Roland Jennings, who had been elected in 1931.
