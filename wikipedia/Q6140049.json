Born in Glasgow, James \"Jim\u201d Morrison studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1950 - 1954. \nIn 1957, along with Anda Paterson and James Spence, he founded the Glasgow Group of artists.Morrison was an Academician of the Royal Scottish Academy and a member of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour.\nIn 1965, Morrison joined the staff at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art, Dundee and settled in Montrose. He left the college in 1987 to paint full-time.\nWhilst in Glasgow he painted several striking canvases of Glasgow tenements. Best known as a landscape painter, his main working areas were the lush farmland around his home in Angus and the rugged landscape of Assynt in Sutherland. He also undertook a number of painting expeditions outside Scotland to southern France, to the Arctic Circle, and the Limpopo region of Botswana.\nThe Royal family own several Morrison paintings, as does J. K. Rowling.\nThe hour-long documentary film, Eye of the Storm, directed Anthony W. J. Baxter (director of You\u2019ve Been Trumped), was scheduled to be premiered at the 2021 Glasgow Film Festival. The film examines Morrison\u2019s documentation of the impact climate change has on the Arctic, to where he travelled many times, and recounts his personal deep interest in the changing landscapes of his native Scotland, in the context of his progressive sight loss. On 4 April 2021 the film was broadcast by BBC Two.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Montrose, Angus", "response": ["* James Morrison RSA, RSW (1932 \u2013 ), artist."]}, {"page": "James Morrison", "response": ["James Morrison or Morison may refer to:", "* James Morrison (Geordie songwriter) (1800\u20131830), Newcastle songwriter", "* James Morrison (fiddler) (1891\u20131947), Irish fiddler", "* James Morrison (artist) (1932\u20132020), Scottish artist, co-founded the Glasgow Group of artists", "* James Morrison (actor) (born 1954), American actor", "* James Morrison (jazz musician) (born 1962), Australian jazz musician", "* James Morrison (singer) (born 1984), English singer and songwriter", "* James Morrison (businessman) (1789\u20131857), British businessman and politician", "* James Morrison (Western Australia) (1846\u20131927), Australian businessman and politician", "* James Morrison (British politician) (1873\u20131934), British landowner and MP for Nottingham East", "* James Morrison, 2nd Baron Margadale (1930\u20132003), British peer", "* James Morrison (Kansas politician) (1942\u20132010), American politician from Kansas", "* James Morrison (bishop) (1861\u20131950), Canadian Roman Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Antigonish, Nova Scotia", "* James Morrison (American football) (1871\u20131939), American college football player and coach at TCU and VPI", "* James Morrison (cricketer) (born 1936), New Zealand cricketer", "* James J.
