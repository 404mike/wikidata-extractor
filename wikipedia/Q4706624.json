Shachtman had also wound up his political organisation, although Dix remained close to Hal Draper, a former supporter of Shachtman in the U.S.  He himself left Labour in 1961, disappointed with Hugh Gaitskell's leadership, and developed an interest in anarchism, but he rejoined Labour in 1963, and also began working as the publicity and research officer of the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE).  Although he was able to reinvent the union's newspaper, he had a poor working relationship with Sydney Hill, the union's general secretary, and only remained in the post after Vic Feather personally persuaded him that he would find Dix a more senior position once Hill retired.  With this backing, and that of Alan Fisher, who succeeded Hill, Dix was able to create a shop steward system in the union, and developing a novel strategy of rolling industrial action."]}]}}
