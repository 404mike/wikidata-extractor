A French version of Vincent's great work on ancient navigation was made under the sanction of Napoleon by M. Billecoq; and in Germany, where his works were well known, his scholarship was recognised by a degree from G\u00f6ttingen in 1814. \"Next to Rennell, and beyond him in some respects,\" says Sir Clements Markham, \"Vincent was the greatest comparative geographer of his time.\""]}, {"page": "Thomas Rennell", "response": ["At Cambridge, he made the acquaintance of Thomas James Mathias and contributed to the notes of his Pursuits of Literature (1794-7). Mathias mentions him in the poem, in conjunction with Bishops Horsley and Douglas. Rennell left Cambridge on taking holy orders and became curate to his father at Barnack. His ample leisure he devoted to theology. His father soon resigned his prebendal stall at Winchester in his favor. In 1787 he undertook the charge of the populous parish of Alton. Subsequently, perhaps through the influence of the Marquis of Buckingham, he was presented to the rectory of St. Magnus, London Bridge. When he proceeded with D.D. at Cambridge in 1794, he preached a commencement sermon on the French Revolution which impressed Pitt, who called him 'the Demosthenes of the pulpit.' In 1797 Pitt urged him to accept the mastership of the Temple. He resigned from his prebendal stall the next year and devoted himself to his new office. He made friends with the great lawyers of the day, such as Eldon, Stowell, Kenyon, and Erskine, and cultivated the society of the junior members of the bar and the law students. Again, via Pitt's influence, he was appointed in 1805 dean of Winchester, and extensive repairs took place in the cathedral's fabric under his direction."]}, {"page": "Jacobin novel", "response": ["In Thomas James Mathias's The Pursuits of Literature (1794), he states, \u201cGovernment and Literature are now more than ever intimately connected.\u201d What Matias goes on to clarify is that in order to defeat the radicals, conservative writers must change their approach in order to capture the audience. To defend King and country, conservatives decided the best way to attack the radicals was through the same medium. The conservatives\u2019 goal became, paradoxically, to take up the fiction that they had denounced and write their own fictional satires of the Jacobin novels, for the same audience.

Favourable, even enthusiastic, reviews appeared in the Critical Review, Monthly Review and Literary Magazine, and their voices were soon echoed by many others.  John Brown, a then fashionable social commentator, reportedly called The Bard and The Progress of Poesy the best odes in the language; David Garrick thought them the best in any language; Thomas James Mathias compared The Bard favourably to Pindar, Horace, Dante and Petrarch; and by 1807 even Percival Stockdale had changed his mind, and could write of its \"poetical excellence\".  One exception to this trend was Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who in 1799 wrote that \"The Bard once intoxicated me, & now I read it without pleasure\", and more than thirty years later could still remark that he found it \"frigid and artificial\".  On the whole, however, as Edmund Gosse noted, The Bard \"for at least a century remained almost without a rival among poems cherished by strictly poetical persons for the qualities of sublimity and pomp of vision.\""]}, {"page": "James Caulfield", "response": ["* Calcographiana, Guide to the Knowledge and Value of Engraved British Portraits, by J.
