As a cricketer, he was a left-handed middle-order batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler. With county cricket resuming after the First World War in a fairly ad hoc manner in the 1919 season, Oxford University's first-class fixtures that year were largely against scratch teams of amateur cricketers, and Waldock was a regular player for the university side throughout. In the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Oxford, he made 85, and this would remain the highest score of his first-class career. The game just before the 1919 University Match was against a side raised by H. D. G. Leveson Gower at Eastbourne; Waldock took seven first-innings wickets for 46 runs and then scored 80 of a first-wicket partnership of 166 with Miles Howell. Waldock was awarded his cricket blue and was also elected secretary for the 1920 Oxford season; in its notes on the 1919 Oxford season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said that \"Waldock did so well... that people began to talk about him as the coming left-hand bat\"."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Miles Howell (1928)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Miles Howell (1921\u20131922) : M.
