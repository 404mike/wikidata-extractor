Swan also suffered, as he played the game with Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park despite suffering from a painful heel injury, only to require stitches to his eye socket following a kick to the face from Simon Coleman; despite all of this Ternent still insisted that Swan got back on the field for the final fifteen minutes of a 3\u20130 defeat. Swan went public with his desire to leave the club in November 1990, and handed in a transfer request after Ternent refused to use him as a defender rather than an attacker. Following Ternent's dismissal new boss Terry Dolan agreed to let Swan go for a reasonable price, as he was aware that Swan was liable to \"kick off a bit\" if his requests were not granted, and Dolan was also in need of money to build a new team. Whilst waiting for an offer he played Swan as a target man alongside strike partner Andy Payton; Swan scored thirteen goals and Payton scored twelve, though this was not enough to prevent the club from suffering relegation."]}, {"page": "Leo Roget", "response": ["Entering the final year of his contract, Roget was a regular during the first half of the 1999\u201300 season alongside Simon Coleman in central defence.
