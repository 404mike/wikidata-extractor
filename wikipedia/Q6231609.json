The Life Guards now made their charge, most gallantly headed by Colonel Sir John Elley, Deputy Adjutant General, who, at the moment of contact with the French, began by cutting down two men right and left. It was truly a splendid charge; its rapid rush down into the mass of French cavalry, was as terrific in appearance as it was destructive in its effect; for although the French met the attack with firmness, they were utterly unable to hold their ground a single moment, were overthrown with great slaughter, and literally ridden down in such a manner that the road was instantaneously covered with men and horses, scattered in all directions. The Life Guards, pursuing their victorious course, dashed into Genappe, and drove all before them as far as the opposite outlet of the town."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["|Major-General Sir John Elley"]}, {"page": "Governor of Galway", "response": ["* 1826\u20131839: Sir John Elley"]}, {"page": "Elley, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Elley"]}]}}
