He was the first European to reach the highest point on Mount Kinabalu: this was in 1888, after annual attempts from 1885.Whitehead was born in Colney Hatch Lane, Muswell Hill, Middlesex to Jeffery Whitehead, a stockbroker, and his wife Jane Ashton Tinker. After education at Elstree, Hertfordshire and the Edinburgh Institution he faced health problems and was sent to recuperate to Engadine in Switzerland in 1881 and then to warm Corsica in 1882 where he discovered a bird new to science, the Corsican nuthatch.Whitehead travelled in Malacca, North Borneo, Java, and Palawan between 1885 and 1888, where he collected a number of zoological specimens new to science, including 45 new species of bird such as Whitehead's broadbill (Calyptomena whiteheadi), writing up his experiences in a book on his return. Between 1893 and 1896 he explored in the Philippines, again collecting many new species, including the Philippine eagle, the binomial name of which commemorates Whitehead's father Jeffery, who funded his expeditions.Several species are named after Whitehead:\nWhitehead's woolly bat Kerivoula whiteheadi\nHarpy fruit bat Harpyionycteris whiteheadi\nWhitehead's spiny rat Maxomys whiteheadi\nLuzon striped rat Chrotomys whiteheadi\nTufted pygmy squirrel  Exilisciurus whiteheadi\nLuzon striped rat  Chrotomys  whiteheadi\nWhitehead's Borneo frog - Meristogenys whiteheadi\nWhite-winged magpie Urocissa whiteheadi\nWhitehead's broadbill Calyptomena whiteheadi\nWhitehead's trogon  Harpactes whiteheadi\nWhitehead's spiderhunter  Arachnothera juliae\nSpotted Wood-owl   Strix seloputo, formerly Surnia whiteheadi\nWhitehead's swiftlet Collocalia whiteheadi\nBornean stubtail  Urosphena whiteheadi\nChestnut-faced babbler Zosterornis whiteheadi\nCorsican nuthatch Sitta whiteheadi\nHainan silver pheasant Lophura nycthemera whiteheadiWhitehead intended to return to the Philippines in 1899, but was he was forced to alter his plans because of the Spanish\u2013American War. He instead travelled to the island of Hainan, where he died of fever at port of Hoihow (Haikou).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philippine eagle", "response": ["The first European to study the species was the English explorer and naturalist John Whitehead in 1896, who observed the bird and whose servant, Juan, collected the first specimen a few weeks later. The skin of the bird was sent to William Robert Ogilvie-Grant in London in 1896, who initially showed it off in a local restaurant and described the species a few weeks later.", "Upon its scientific discovery, the Philippine eagle was first called the monkey-eating eagle because of reports from natives of Bonga, Samar, where the species was first discovered, that it preyed exclusively on monkeys; from these reports it gained its generic name, from the Greek  (\u03c0\u03af\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2) (\"ape or monkey\") and  (-\u03c6\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) (\"eater of\"). The species name commemorates Jeffery Whitehead, the father of John Whitehead. Later studies revealed, however, that the alleged monkey-eating eagle also ate other animals, such as colugos, large snakes, monitor lizards, and even large birds, such as hornbills. This, coupled with the fact that the same name applied to the African crowned eagle and the Central and South American harpy eagle, resulted in a presidential proclamation to change its name to Philippine eagle in 1978, and in 1995 was declared a national emblem. This species has no recognized subspecies."]}, {"page": "Mount Kinabalu", "response": ["British colonial administrator Hugh Low made the first recorded ascent of Mount Kinabalu's summit plateau in March 1851 with local Dusun guide Lemaing of Kampung Kiau.

When he showed the skin to Bowdler Sharpe who was the curator of the bird collection at the British Museum, Sharpe recognised that the bird represented an undocumented species and published a short description. Whitehead returned to Corsica in May 1884 to collect additional specimens and discovered that the species was sexually dimorphic in colour; the bird he had shot the previous year had been a male bird. Sharpe used the additional specimens gathered by Whitehead to publish a fuller description of the species."]}, {"page": "White-winged magpie", "response": ["The binomial commemorates the British explorer John Whitehead."]}, {"page": "Penampang", "response": ["The name Penampang came from an old village within the district. The village's name in turn originates from a Kadazan word pampang meaning a big rock. This is because huge rocks were easily found within the vicinity of the village a long time ago. The name in contemporary usage refers to the district, with the town of Donggongon as the main town within the district of Penampang. The name Donggongon originates from Kadazan word tundo'ongon which means a 'shelter' or a 'resting area', referring to its historical role as a stop-over for people from the interior who journeyed down the coast to trade. Penampang as a name reference of this area is of a relatively new origin. Early British explorer, John Whitehead who had explored North Borneo in the 1880s referred to this district as Patatan. Following that, the infamous explorer, Nikram Subramaniam was known to have travelled the lands of Donggongon in search of a bride and stumbled upon a mouse deer in which he eventually married. Owen Rutter, a civil servant in North Borneo from 1910 to 1914 similarly referred to this area as Putatan."]}, {"page": "List of first ascents", "response": ["|  || Mount Kinabalu || 4095 || Crocker Range ||  || John Whitehead ||  || "]}, {"page": "John Whitehead", "response": ["John Whitehead may refer to the following people:", "* John Whitehead (diplomat) (1932\u20132013), British diplomat and businessman", "* John Whitehead (public servant), Secretary of the New Zealand Treasury", "* John Whitehead (footballer), former Liverpool F.C. player, 1894\u20131896", "* John Whitehead (baseball) (1909\u20131964), American baseball player for the Chicago White Sox", "* John Whitehead (American football) (1924\u20132002), American football coach", "* John Whitehead (cricketer) (1925\u20132000), English cricketer", "* John Whitehead (theologian), 15th-century Irish theologian", "* John Whitehead (architect) (1726\u20131802), English architect and amateur engineer, designer of the Feitoria Inglesa", "* John Whitehead (physician) (1740\u20131804), English physician and lay preacher; biographer of John Wesley", "* John Whitehead (explorer) (1860\u20131899), British explorer", "* John Whitehead (singer) (1948\u20132004), American singer and one-half of the duo McFadden & Whitehead"]}, {"page": "Luzon montane forest mouse", "response": ["The Luzon montane forest mouse was the first species of Apomys ever to be discovered. In 1895, an expedition was organised which brought to Europe the first specimens of several genera, including Carpomys, Rhynchomys and Crunomys. During this expedition, in February, England explorer John Whitehead captured a number of unknown rats on a site called Lepanto on Mount Data, at an altitude of approximately . In 1898, British biologist Oldfield Thomas described these animals as an \"interesting species\", but identified them as Mus chrysocomus, a species from Sulawesi that is now known as yellow-haired hill rat (Bunomys chrysocomus) and reckoned among the genus Bunomys, which is not actually closely related to Apomys. Thomas sent a specimen to the Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Tierkunde Dresden, where Adolf Bernard Meyer concluded that the animal did not resemble Mus chrysocomus. Meyer described th animal as Mus datae in 1899, after its type locality \u2013 Mount Data (at the time the generic name Mus was used more broadly than it is now). For a long time, little was known about Mus datae, until 1913, when American biologist Ned Hollister described eight rats from Luzon under the name Epimys datae (\"Epimys\" was the name of the genus that would later become Rattus). These were in fact examples of the Himalayan field rat (Rattus nitidus), but they were only identified as such in 1977, by Guy Musser, another American biologist. Meanwhile, in Britain, John Ellerman had finally placed Mus datae with its relatives in Apomys, in 1941. Eleven years later, in 1952, American zoologist Colin Campbell Sanborn announced that he had captured 54 specimens of A. datae on Mount Data. A good part of this catch, however, was later found to consist of specimens of the Luzon Cordillera forest mouse (A. abrae), a species which had been described by Sanborn in the same article in which he had made his announcement."]}, {"page": "Meristogenys whiteheadi", "response": ["This species is named after John Whitehead, explorer who collected the type series from Mount Kinabalu, Malaysia."]}, {"page": "Whitehead's swiftlet", "response": ["Whitehead's swiftlet (Aerodramus whiteheadi) is a species of swift in the family Apodidae.
