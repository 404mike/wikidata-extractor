The squad was boosted by the arrivals of Ted Collins and Jack Needham, who signed after their club Wolverhampton Wanderers shut down operations. The pair \"showed their true regard for the game\" by turning up to play Stockport County on 16 September despite working until 6 am earlier that day; however former Valeite Bob Suart inspired County to a 5\u20133 win. Two more draws followed, including a 0\u20130 draw at Stoke, though this was then followed by five defeats in six games. The 13th game of the campaign proved unlucky for visitors Blackpool, as Vale recorded their first victory by a remarkable 11\u20131 scoreline, with Jack Needham, Holford, James Wootton, Albert Broadhurst and George Shelton all claiming two goals each, supplemented by a single strike for Albert Groves. They then beat Oldham Athletic 4\u20130, before dropping into a losing streak of seven defeats in nine games to prove the Blackpool result as an anomaly as the club dropped to last place. They recovered to lose only three of their final eight games, though the final day victory over Manchester United proved \"a farce\" as the visitors only turned up with four players and had to loan the other seven to make up a full team. Vale finished in 15th-place with 21 points from 30 games, whilst Needham finished as top-scorer with ten goals.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| George Shelton", "|2||MF||||George Shelton||7||0||7", "| August 1916 || MF ||  || George Shelton || Wellington Town || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1917\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| George Shelton"]}]}}
