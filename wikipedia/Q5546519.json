These figures brought him for the first time into leading positions in the seasonal first-class statistics. He was the fifth highest runscorer behind Harry Jupp, Tom Hearne, Charles Buller and Russell Walker; and second in the batting averages behind Robert Carpenter. He was a creditable 15th in the list of wicket-takers, having bowled many less deliveries than all of those above him except James Southerton.

Towards the end of the month, Grace represented the South in the North v. South match at Bramall Lane, his team winning by 66 runs. He scored 122 out of 173 in the first innings and then took 6\u201357. His batting against the formidable bowling of George Freeman, Tom Emmett and George Wootton was so good that the laconic Emmett afterwards declared Grace to be a \"nonsuch\" (i.e., a nonpareil) and then famously said: \"He ought to be made to play with a littler bat\".Darwin, p.40."]}, {"page": "Edward Austin (cricketer)", "response": ["While studying at Trinity College, Oxford, Austin made a single first-class appearance for Oxford University against the Marylebone Cricket Club at the Magdalen Ground, Oxford in 1869.
