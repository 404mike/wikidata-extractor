Olive made fundamental contributions to string theory and duality theory, he is particularly known for his work on the GSO projection and Montonen\u2013Olive duality.\nHe was professor of physics at Imperial College, London, from 1984 to 1992. In 1992 he moved to Swansea University to help set up the new theoretical physics group.He was awarded the Dirac Prize and Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in 1997.  He was a Founding Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales. He was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1987, and appointed CBE in 2002.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "M-theory", "response": ["In the late 1970s, Claus Montonen and David Olive had conjectured a special property of certain physical theories.Montonen and Olive 1977 A sharpened version of their conjecture concerns a theory called  supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory, which describes theoretical particles formally similar to the quarks and gluons that make up atomic nuclei. The strength with which the particles of this theory interact is measured by a number called the coupling constant. The result of Montonen and Olive, now known as Montonen\u2013Olive duality, states that  supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory with coupling constant  is equivalent to the same theory with coupling constant . In other words, a system of strongly interacting particles (large coupling constant) has an equivalent description as a system of weakly interacting particles (small coupling constant) and vice versa Duff 1998, p. 66 by spin-moment."]}, {"page": "List of physicists", "response": ["*David Olive \u2013 U.K. (1937\u20132012)"]}, {"page": "String theory", "response": ["String theory eventually made it out of the dustbin, but for the following decade, all work on the theory was completely ignored. Still, the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks to the work of a handful of devotees. Ferdinando Gliozzi, Jo\u00ebl Scherk, and David Olive realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-strings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined. The resulting theory did not have a tachyon and was proven to have space-time supersymmetry by John Schwarz and Michael Green in 1984. The same year, Alexander Polyakov gave the theory a modern path integral formulation, and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively. In 1979, Daniel Friedan showed that the equations of motions of string theory, which are generalizations of the Einstein equations of general relativity, emerge from the renormalization group equations for the two-dimensional field theory. Schwarz and Green discovered T-duality, and constructed two superstring theories\u2014IIA and IIB related by T-duality, and type I theories with open strings. The consistency conditions had been so strong, that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined, with only a few discrete choices."]}, {"page": "Churchill College, Cambridge", "response": ["* David Olive - Physicist"]}, {"page": "Dirac Medal", "response": ["* 1997: David Olive, Peter Goddard"]}, {"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["* David Olive, physicist"]}, {"page": "Virasoro algebra", "response": ["Daniel Friedan, Zongan Qiu, and Stephen Shenker (1984) showed that these conditions are necessary, and Peter Goddard, Adrian Kent, and David Olive (1986) used the coset construction or GKO construction (identifying unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra within tensor products of unitary representations of affine Kac\u2013Moody algebras) to show that they are sufficient."]}, {"page": "S-duality", "response": ["It is natural to ask whether there is an analog in gauge theory of the symmetry interchanging the electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations. The answer was given in the late 1970s by Claus Montonen and David Olive,Montonen and Olive 1977 building on earlier work of Peter Goddard, Jean Nuyts, and Olive.Goddard, Nuyts, and Olive 1977 Their work provides an example of S-duality now known as Montonen\u2013Olive duality. Montonen\u2013Olive duality applies to a very special type of gauge theory called N = 4 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory, and it says that two such  theories may be equivalent in a certain precise sense.
