Hence, the full standardization of a language is impractical, because a standardized dialect cannot fully function as a real entity, but does function as set of linguistic norms observed to varying degrees in the course of usus \u2013 of how people actually speak and write the language. In practice, the language varieties identified as standard are neither uniform nor fully stabilized, especially in their spoken forms. From that perspective, the linguist Suzanne Romaine says that standard languages can be conceptually compared to the imagined communities of nation and nationalism, as described by the political scientist Benedict Anderson, which indicates that linguistic standardization is the result of a society's history and sociology, and thus is not a universal phenomenon; of the approximately 7,000 contemporary spoken languages, most do not have a codified standard dialect."]}, {"page": "California English", "response": ["* Language in Society: An Introduction to Sociolinguistics.

In early 1914, he had been surveying a portion of the international boundary in the Upper Waria River between the German and British protectorates.  By late September, he had passed into a different portion of the highlands, where the clay-slate mountains changed into limestone highlands.  In this geologic transition, he said, he also found a change in the ethnographic character of the population, whom he described as a \"new\" people.  They were stocky, powerfully built, and long\u2013limbed; they wore their hair in knots on the centre of their heads, which were otherwise shaven, and painted yellow and black lines across their chests. They also wore grass skirts, so he called them the skirted ones. They used bows and arrows, slings and stone axes. As he pushed west to Mount Joseph, Detzner claimed, he had found the southern hills of the central watershed cut by numerous rivers flowing north to south. He had surmised that there were no insurmountable obstacles between him and the Sepik river.Biskup, pp. 16\u201319; Spinks, p. 228. In 1917, he had travelled through the Ramu valley into the Bismarck range, northwest of the Kratke Mountains, and had continued on that route for .Biskup, pp. 14\u201318; Spinks, p. 228 He also described the presence of an indigenous variation of German, called Unserdeutsch (our German), in several New Guinean dialects.K\u00fcttelwesch, 2006; Suzanne Romaine, \"Grammaticalization of the Proximative in Tok Pisin\".
