He started playing golf with his father at the age of ten. Having played in the Faldo Junior Series, he went on to a successful amateur career, highlighted by winning the English Amateur and Lytham Trophy, where he broke the previous scoring record by 10 strokes, in 2004. He turned professional at the end of that year.Having played in three tournaments on the European tour as an amateur in 2004, Heath joined the second tier Challenge Tour in 2005, and was moderately successful in his first season, finishing 23rd on the end of season rankings. Having failed to come through qualifying school at the end of the year, he was again playing on the second tier in 2006. He enjoyed even more success, winning his first professional title at the ECCO Tour Championship in Denmark on his way to 14th in the Challenge Tour Rankings and graduation to the European Tour for 2007.\nHeath's rookie season on the European Tour was largely unsuccessful, although he did manage two top ten finishes in minor events, and he was back on the Challenge Tour in 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 17", "response": ["*1983 \u2013 James Heath, English golfer"]}, {"page": "Richard McEvoy", "response": ["| James Heath"]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["*2001 Clancy Bowe, Stephen Buckley, Chris Cousins, James Heath, Scott Jackson, Farren Keenan, David Porter, Niall Turner, Daniel Wardrop"]}, {"page": "Belgian Open (golf)", "response": ["The first edition of the Belgian Knockout, which is the 53rd edition of the Belgian Open, took place from 17 to 20 May 2018 at Rinkven International Golf Club, Schilde, Antwerp.
