He helped Portsmouth to the 1992 FA Cup semi final which they lost on a penalty shootout to Liverpool.\nIn addition to his goalkeeping record, he is the second-longest serving Portsmouth player of all time behind Jimmy Dickinson.

However, with both Salmon and Ammann injured towards the end of the 1995\u201396 season, Petterson played well enough in the final nine games, conceding only five goals and helping the club to the play off Semi Finals, to earn a new contract. He began the following season as Salmon's deputy, but after his return to the side in January 1997 became first choice, winning the club's player of the year award at the end of the season. The start of the 1997\u201398 season saw Petterson as Charlton's first choice keeper, but after 26 appearances lost his place to first Salmon and then Sasa Ilic as Charlton Athletic gained promotion to the Premier League via a Wembley play-off final win over Sunderland. Petterson started the 1998-99 Premier League season for Charlton Athletic as deputy to Ilic and made his first appearance as a substitute in a 2\u20131 loss to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He then started the next game as the Addicks defeated West Ham United 4\u20132 at the Valley. Petterson again returned to the substitute's bench after Ilic was declared fit before he was allowed to join Portsmouth on loan in November 1998 as cover for Alan Knight. Petterson stayed until February, helping Pompey survive relegation in 1999 before returning to an unsuccessful relegation battle for Charlton Athletic as the South London club returned to the Championship after just one season in the top flight."]}, {"page": "Timeline of English football", "response": ["*Alan Knight, 39-year-old goalkeeper, retires after playing 801 games for Portsmouth since 1978."]}, {"page": "Aaron Flahavan", "response": ["Flahavan played for the Southampton youth team, before turning professional with Portsmouth at age 18 in 1994.
