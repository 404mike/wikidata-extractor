He was an all-rounder and a good slip fielder, whose long first-class career with Surrey linked the days of Jack Hobbs with those of Peter May.\nA tall man, he might have achieved even more than he did but for back trouble. Even so, he was an essential member of the Surrey side for many years. As a batsman, he preferred to attack, and was an especially fine driver of the ball. He was often at his best in a crisis. He reached a thousand runs in a season nine times in succession (1938\u20131939 and 1946\u20131952 \u2013 this excludes 1945, in which season he played in only one match). His medium-paced bowling was generally steady rather than particularly penetrative. He took 50 or more wickets in a season 5 times, but never managed more than 67.\nHe never played Test cricket, although he was picked as a member of the party to India in 1939\u201340, for a tour which never took place because of the outbreak of World War II. The War also deprived him of six of what, judging by his age, might have been expected to be amongst his best seasons. \nMost of his best years were after the war, for it was not until 1937 that he became a really valuable member of the side. He had his best season with the ball, in terms of his average, in 1946, taking 56 wickets at only 15.58 each. He made his highest score of 255 in 1949 against the touring New Zealanders, the innings taking only six and a half hours. That season was his best with the bat, both in terms of aggregate (1789) and average (40.65). He finished on a high note, retiring after the 1952 season in which Surrey won the County Championship outright for the first time since 1914, having shared the title in 1950.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Jack Parker"]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["Australia won the toss and sent Surrey in to bat. They made 221, and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort in which there were six single-figure scores. As the match started the day after the Second Test, Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers, and Ring took three wickets, while the Test players only took two in total. Hamence opened the batting for Australia\u2014Brown injured a finger while fielding\u2014but he was out for a duck. Hassett (139) and Bradman (128) then put on 231, Bradman making his sixth century of the tour. However, the Australians lost wickets steadily thereafter to be all out for 389. Surrey made 289 in their second innings, with McCool taking 6/113 after bowling more than 40% of the overs. The hosts batted steadily with three fifties, but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised. The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final. Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs.
