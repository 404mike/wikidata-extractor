Harry Flashman appears in a series of 12 of Fraser's books, collectively known as The Flashman Papers, with covers illustrated by Arthur Barbosa. Flashman was played by Malcolm McDowell in the Richard Lester 1975 film Royal Flash.In Tom Brown's School Days (1857), Flashman is portrayed as a notorious Rugby School bully who persecutes Tom Brown and is finally expelled for drunkenness, at which point he simply disappears. Fraser decided to write the story of Flashman's later life, in which the school bully would be identified as an \"illustrious Victorian soldier\", experiencing many of the 19th-century wars and adventures of the Empire and rising to high rank in the British Army, to be acclaimed as a great warrior, while still remaining \"a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward\u2014and, oh yes, a toady.\" Fraser's Flashman is an antihero who often runs away from danger. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ashby-de-la-Zouch", "response": ["*Harry Flashman, Sir Harry Paget Flashman VC, KCB, KCIE is a fictional character created by Thomas Hughes (1822\u20131896) in the semi-autobiographical Tom Brown's School Days (1857) and later developed by George MacDonald Fraser (1925\u20132008).

The book begins with a fictional note explaining that the Flashman Papers were discovered in 1965 during a sale of household furniture in Ashby, Leicestershire. The papers are attributed to Harry Paget Flashman, the bully featured in Thomas Hughes' novel, who becomes a well-known Victorian military hero (in Fraser's fictional England). The papers were supposedly written between 1900 and 1905. The subsequent publishing of these papers, of which Flashman is the first instalment, contrasts the public image of a (fictional) hero with his own more scandalous account of his life as an amoral and cowardly bully. Flashman begins with the eponymous hero's own account of his expulsion from Rugby and ends with his fame as \"the Hector of Afghanistan\". It details his life from 1839 to 1842 and his travels to Scotland, India, and Afghanistan. It also contains a number of notes by the author, in the guise of a fictional editor, providing additional historical glosses on the events described.
