Harry Flashman appears in a series of 12 of Fraser's books, collectively known as The Flashman Papers, with covers illustrated by Arthur Barbosa. Flashman was played by Malcolm McDowell in the Richard Lester 1975 film Royal Flash.In Tom Brown's School Days (1857), Flashman is portrayed as a notorious Rugby School bully who persecutes Tom Brown and is finally expelled for drunkenness, at which point he simply disappears. Fraser decided to write the story of Flashman's later life, in which the school bully would be identified as an \"illustrious Victorian soldier\", experiencing many of the 19th-century wars and adventures of the Empire and rising to high rank in the British Army, to be acclaimed as a great warrior, while still remaining \"a scoundrel, a liar, a cheat, a thief, a coward\u2014and, oh yes, a toady.\" Fraser's Flashman is an antihero who often runs away from danger. Nevertheless, through a combination of luck and cunning, he usually ends each volume acclaimed as a hero.", "link_mentions": {}}}
