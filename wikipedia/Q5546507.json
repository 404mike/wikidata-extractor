He was a member of the West Bromwich team that reached the 1886 and 1887 cup finals, going out 2\u20130 to Blackburn Rovers (in a replay) and Aston Villa respectively.\nIn 1888, West Bromwich reached the final for the third consecutive year, when they met favourites, Preston North End at the Kennington Oval on 24 March 1888. Woodhall scored the winning goal with thirteen minutes remaining, when the West Bromwich forwards outjumped Preston's defence and Woodhall pounced on the rebound, turning sharply to steer the ball between the posts, thus enabling his team to claim the first of their five FA Cup victories.\nSpry Woodhall made his League debut on 8 September 1888, as a forward for West Bromwich Albion in a 2\u20130 win against Stoke at the Victoria Ground. He also scored the second goal in the match. He played ten of the \"Throstles\" 22 Football League matches and scored three goals in season 1888-89 and was part of a forward-line that scored three goals or more in a League match on one occasion.Described by one source as well-nicknamed, for he was indeed a sprightly player, figuring prominently at outside-right for Albion in the early days. He could centre with great accuracy and combined well in team work, especially with Billy Bassett as his partner.Woodhall represented England twice, making his debut against Wales on 4 February 1888, when he scored the third goal in a 5\u20131 victory. Woodhall's goal was England's 100th international goal. He also played in the next match against Scotland which was won 5\u20130; the following month, England defeated Ireland 5\u20131 (although Woodhall was not selected, his place on the right wing going to his West Bromwich team-mate Billy Bassett) to claim the 1888 British Home Championship convincingly.", "link_mentions": {}}}
