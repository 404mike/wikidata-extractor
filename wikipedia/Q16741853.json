His younger brother was Henry St Paul, MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed from 1812 to 1820. It would be hard to describe St. Paul's background more clearly than R.G. Thorne does: 'St. Paul's father, a Northumbrian gentleman driven into exile after killing a man in a duel, was a soldier of fortune in the Seven Years' War, who returned to England with an Austrian title and a royal pardon, subsequently distinguishing himself in diplomacy, before retiring to his ancestral home.'\nSt Paul was educated at Houghton le Spring and Eton College (1783). He succeeded his father in 1812 as a count of the Austrian Empire.\nHe joined the British Army  as an ensign in the 1st Foot regiment in 1793, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1794. He transferred to the 1st Dragoon Guards as a cornet in March 1794, became a lieutenant in July 1794 and a captain in 1798. He was then a major in the 5th Foot in 1802, rising to brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1811, and to colonel (on half-pay) in 1820.\nHe was elected MP for Bridport in 1812, sitting until 1820, when he was beaten by Christopher Spurrier. However he regained the seat on petition and sat again until 1832. He was created a baronet on 17 November 1813.\nIn 1832, he attempted to win the newly created seat of Dudley but was defeated by the Whig, Sir John Campbell.He married, 14 May 1803, Anna Maria, the natural daughter and heiress of John Ward, 2nd Viscount Dudley and Ward and had a son and 5 daughters. He was succeeded by his son Horace (1812\u201391), MP for Worcestershire East, who succeeded him as count and baronet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick Berkeley, 5th Earl of Berkeley", "response": ["*Craven FitzHardinge Berkeley (28 July 1805 \u2013 1 July 1855), married first, Augusta St Paul in 1839 daughter of Sir Horace St Paul, 1st Baronet, and had issue:"]}]}}
