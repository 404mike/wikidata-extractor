The book suggests using stated preference techniques to determine the value of non-market goods and environmental effects for cost\u2013benefit analysis. Within the book, the chapters are divided into several focuses including: economic values, measurement and techniques of economic values, stages of stated preference work and organizing the results. The authors outline the steps necessary to conduct a stated preference study by using two alternate methods: choice modelling and contingent valuation. These surveying methods concentrates on the willingness to pay by consumers and with the collected sample data to be analyzed through various statistical tests. The manual is recommended for assessing data values in policy decision making."]}, {"page": "List of Fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2020s", "response": ["* Ian Bateman, University of Exeter"]}]}}
