From the outset of its work in 1977 there have been two Secretariat pioneers in developing the case law of the Committee when it considers petitions from individuals claiming violations of their rights: Jakob M\u00f6ller (Iceland) and Alfred de Zayas (USA). M\u00f6ller was the first Chief of the Petitions branch of what is today the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and de Zayas was his colleague, who eventually succeeded him as Chief.\"", "*International Human Rights Monitoring Mechanisms (with Gudmundur Alfredsson and Bertrand Ramcharan).
