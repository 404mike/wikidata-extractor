However, in 1923 he won the seat, but was Member of Parliament (MP) for Gateshead for less than a year, losing the seat at the general election in October 1924. He did not contest Gateshead again, but stood unsuccessfully in the Darlington by-election in 1926 and at Consett in 1929.\nWhen the Liberal Party split over participation in the Conservative-dominated National Government, Dickie joined the breakaway National Liberals, and was elected at the 1931 general election as National Liberal MP for Consett.  He was defeated at the 1935 general election, and did not stand again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbert Dunnico", "response": ["At the 1931 general election, he was defeated in Consett by the Liberal National candidate John Dickie.
