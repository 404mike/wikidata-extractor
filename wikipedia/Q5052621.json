In the same paper, Tim Walker lauded Richard McCabe's performance as Ben Jonson but referred to the play itself as \"very boring\". Walker said Stewart \"makes the best of what is a rather unappealing part [and] little more than a vehicle for a rather minor writer to attempt to score points against an incomparably greater one.\" According to Belinda Liversedge of Londonist, \"the ideas somehow don't translate into magic on stage.
