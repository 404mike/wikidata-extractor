Moreover, spices have always been comparatively expensive: in 15th century Oxford, a whole pig cost about the same as a pound of the cheapest spice, pepper. There is also no evidence of such use from contemporary cookbooks: \"Old cookbooks make it clear that spices weren't used as a preservative. They typically suggest adding spices toward the end of the cooking process, where they could have no preservative effect whatsoever.\"Michael Krondl, The Taste of Conquest: The Rise and Fall of the Three Great Cities of Spice, 2007, , p. 6 Indeed, Cristoforo di Messisbugo suggested in the 16th century that pepper may speed up spoilage."]}, {"page": "Breakfast", "response": ["In the post-Homeric classical period of Greece, a meal called  was typically consumed immediately after rising in the morning.

They also claim pastirma as one of their specialities. In spite of such Byzantine precursors as apokti, it is true that the pastirma tradition has deep roots in the nomadic culture of the medieval Turks. It is highly probable that they transmitted the idea to the Cappadocians alongtime before Constantinople was conquered, and, although Constantinople knew all about pastirma from the seventeenth century onwards, it is certain that after the population exchanges of 1923 modern Greece acquired its knowledge of pastirma from the Capadocians.

The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink, though, writes that past\u0131rma is the word the Ottomans used for a type of Byzantine cured beef that was called paston (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd). The Oxford Companion for Food says that a Byzantine dried meat delicacy was \"a forerunner of the pastirma of modern Turkey\".  According to Johannes Koder, an expert in Byzantine studies,  paston could mean either salted meat or salted fish, while akropaston (\u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd) means salted meat. Andrew Dalby gives the definition of paston as \"salted fish\" and akropaston apakin as \"well-salted fillet steak\". Gregory Nagy gives the definition of akropaston as \"smoked\", describing apakin as \"a kind of salami sausage, probably similar to pastourma\"."]}, {"page": "Mediterranean cuisine", "response": ["Greek cookery makes wide use of vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, wine and meat (white and red, including lamb, poultry, rabbit and pork). Other important ingredients include olives, cheese, aubergine, courgette, lemon juice, vegetables, herbs, bread and yoghurt. Some more dishes that can be traced back to Ancient Greece are: lentil soup, fasolada, retsina (white or ros\u00e9 wine flavoured with pine resin) and pasteli (sesame seeds baked with honey); some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods include: loukaniko (dried pork sausage); and Byzantium: feta cheese, avgotaraho (bottarga) and paximadhia (rusk). Lakerda (pickled fish), mizithra cheese and desserts like diples, koulourakia, moustokouloura and melomakarono also date back to the Byzantine period, while the variety of different pitas probably dates back to ancient times. Much of Greek cuisine is part of the larger tradition of Ottoman cuisine, the names of the dishes revealing Arabic, Persian or Turkish roots: moussaka, tzatziki, yuvarlakia, keftes and so on. Many dishes' names probably entered the Greek vocabulary during Ottoman times, or earlier in contact with the Persians and the Arabs. However, some dishes may be pre-Ottoman, only taking Turkish names later; the historians of food John Ash and Andrew Dalby, for example, speculate that grape-leaf dolmadhes were made by the early Byzantine period, while Alan Davidson traces trahana to the ancient Greek tragos and skordalia to the ancient Athenian skorothalmi."]}, {"page": "Category talk:English historians", "response": ["List of all pages in category English historians retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.
