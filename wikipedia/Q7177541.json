A 2013 paper suggested that models commonly underestimate the solar radiation absorption characteristics of wildfire soot.  In 2007, Professor Wieslaw Maslowski from the Naval Postgraduate School, California, predicted removal of summer ice by 2013; subsequently, in 2013, Maslowski predicted 2016 \u00b13 years.   A 2006 paper predicted \"near ice-free September conditions by 2040\". Overland and Wang (2013) investigated three different ways of predicting future sea ice levels. The IPCC AR5 (for at least one scenario) estimates an ice-free summer might occur around 2050.  The Third U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), released May 6, 2014, reports that the Arctic Ocean is expected to be ice free in summer before mid-century. Models that best match historical trends project a nearly ice-free Arctic in the summer by the 2030s. However, these models do tend to underestimate the rate of sea ice loss since 2007. Based on the outcomes of several different models, Overland and Wang (2013) put the early limit for a sea ice free summer Arctic near 2040.  Professor James Anderson of Harvard University envisions the Arctic Ice gone by the early 2020s. \"The chance that there will be any permanent ice left in the Arctic after 2022 is essentially zero,\" he said in June 2019.", "Dark, open water left behind as sea ice melts absorbs more heat than ice-covered water, leading to physical implications that include the ice\u2013albedo feedback or warmer sea surface temperatures which increase ocean heat content. This also increases pressure and decreases wind speeds. These feedback effects are  stronger in the lower atmosphere. As Peter Wadhams, a polar researcher writes \"once summer ice yields to open water, the albedo\u00a0... drops from 0.6 to 0.1, which will further accelerate warming of the Arctic and of the whole planet.\" The Arctic is heating approximately twice as fast as the global average, according to Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis. Economic implications of ice-free summers and the decline in Arctic ice volumes include a greater number of journeys across the Arctic Ocean Shipping lanes during the year. This number has grown from 0, in 1979 to 400\u2013500 along the Bering strait and >40 along the Northern Sea Route, in 2013. "]}, {"page": "List of recipients of the W. S.
