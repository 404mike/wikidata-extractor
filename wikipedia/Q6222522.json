Galen (AD 129\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009200/c.\u2009216) mentioned that oxygala was consumed with honey, similar to the way thickened Greek yogurt is eaten today. The oldest writings mentioning yogurt are attributed to Pliny the Elder, who remarked that certain \"barbarous nations\" knew how \"to thicken the milk into a substance with an agreeable acidity\".The Natural History of Pliny, tr. John Bostock, Henry Thomas Riley, London: Bell, 1856\u201393, Volume 3, p. 84: \"It is a remarkable circumstance, that the barbarous nations which subsist on milk have been for so many ages either ignorant of the merits of cheese, or else have totally disregarded it; and yet they understand how to thicken milk and form therefrom an acrid kind of milk with a pleasant flavor\". The use of yogurt by medieval Turks is recorded in the books D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk by Mahmud Kashgari and Kutadgu Bilig by Yusuf Has Hajib written in the 11th century. Both texts mention the word \"yogurt\" in different sections and describe its use by nomadic Turks. The earliest yogurts were probably spontaneously fermented by wild bacteria in goat skin bags."]}, {"page": "1819 in science", "response": ["* English physician John Bostock publishes the first account of allergic rhinitis (in himself).Bostock, John. \"Case of a Periodical Affection of the Eyes and Chest\", presented to Medical and Chirurgical Society of London."]}, {"page": "1773 in science", "response": ["* June 29 (bapt.) \u2013 John Bostock, English physician and geologist (died 1846)"]}, {"page": "1846 in science", "response": ["* August 6 \u2013 John Bostock (born 1773), English physician and geologist (died of cholera)."]}, {"page": "Carboxyhemoglobin", "response": ["After the discovery of carbon monoxide by William Cruickshank in 1800, Johann D\u00f6mling (1803) and John Bostock (1804) developed hypotheses suggesting blood returned to the heart loaded with carbon monoxide to subsequently be oxidized to carbon dioxide in the lung prior to exhalation. Later in 1854, Adrien Chenot similarly suggested carbon monoxide could remove oxygen from blood and be oxidized within the body to carbon dioxide. The mechanism for carbon monoxide poisoning in the context of carboxyhemoglobin formation is widely credited to Claude Bernard whose memoirs beginning in 1846 and published in 1857 notably phrased, \"prevents arterials blood from becoming venous\". Felix Hoppe-Seyler independently published similar conclusions in the following year."]}]}}
