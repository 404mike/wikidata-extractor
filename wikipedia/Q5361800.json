He played non first-class cricket for Durham in 1884 and 1885.\nBorn in Yeadon, near Leeds, Yorkshire, England, Rawlinson was a right-handed batsman, standing nearly five foot nine inches, who scored 1,120 runs at 15.34, with a best of 55 for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire.  He took 8 wickets at an average of 9.87, bowling right arm round arm fast, with a best analysis of 4 for 41 for Yorkshire against Gloucestershire. He took 23 catches, mainly at cover point.\nHe emigrated to Australia, officiating  one match between Australia and England in Sydney on 28 January to 31 January 1887; won by England by 13 runs after scoring a paltry 45 runs in their first innings.  His colleague was Charles Bannerman, the scorer of the first Test century in 1877, standing in the first of his 12 matches as umpire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Bannerman", "response": ["Between 1887 and 1902, Bannerman stood as umpire in 12 Test matches in Australia. His first match was between Australia and England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from 28 to 31 January 1887. England won by 13 runs after scoring only 45 runs in their first innings.

Bannerman's last match, at Melbourne in the 1901\u201302 season, was also a close low-scoring affair with Australia winning by 32 runs. On this occasion his colleague was Bob Crockett standing in his first season as a Test umpire. In two of the matches in which Charles Bannerman officiated, his brother Alick was a player, but no accusations of bias could be made as Alick scored only 23 runs in four innings."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Elisha Rawlinson||||1||1887||1887"]}, {"page": "Henry Rawlinson (umpire)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Elisha Rawlinson"]}, {"page": "Burnley Cricket Club", "response": ["*Elisha Rawlinson."]}, {"page": "United North of England Eleven", "response": ["In the next match at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, the UNEE won by an innings and 5 runs.CricketArchive \u2013 match scorecard.
