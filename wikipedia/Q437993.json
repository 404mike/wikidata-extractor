He was most recently the manager of Scottish Premiership club Celtic.\nDuring his playing career he represented English clubs Manchester City, Crewe Alexandra and Leicester City. Lennon moved to Celtic in 2000, where he made over 200 appearances and was appointed captain in 2005. Before retiring as a player, he returned to England and played for Nottingham Forest and Wycombe Wanderers. Lennon made 40 appearances for Northern Ireland in nine years, scoring two goals.\nLennon was appointed manager of Celtic in March 2010, initially in a caretaker capacity, after the departure of Tony Mowbray. Lennon enjoyed significant success as Celtic manager, winning three Scottish league championships, two Scottish Cups, qualifying for the group stage of the Champions League twice and the knockout stages once, before leaving the club in May 2014. After an unsuccessful spell with Bolton Wanderers, where the club suffered financial problems, Lennon returned to Scottish football in 2016 with Hibernian. He led them to a promotion in his first season as head coach, and European qualification in his second season, before leaving Hibernian in January 2019.\nLennon returned to Celtic in February 2019, initially on an interim basis for the rest of the 2018\u201319 season, and guided them to the league and Scottish Cup titles. His contract was renewed and he led Celtic to the Scottish league title again in 2019\u201320. He also led the team to a fourth consecutive domestic treble by also winning the League Cup and the Scottish Cup that season.
