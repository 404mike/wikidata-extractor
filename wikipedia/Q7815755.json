He played in all six of Cardiff's fixtures leading up to the final. In his career, Farquharson had developed a reputation as a penalty specialist, even being dubbed \"the penalty king\". His method of saving spot kicks by rushing forward as the penalty was being taken proved so effective that in the quarterfinal of the FA Cup, his save to deny Chelsea forward Andrew Wilson's penalty prompted the sport's governing bodies to change the rules of the game. Goalkeepers were subsequently banned from rushing from their goal line when facing penalty kicks. Wilson later described the incident, remarking \"I thought I was seeing things when I looked at Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. As I placed the ball, he was standing with his back against the net [...] I shot and he dashed forward and made a wonder save.\" Farquharson explained the reasoning behind his technique, stating \"By advancing forward I can leap to either side far more quickly than from a standing position.\""]}, {"page": "Daniel Cox", "response": ["| Tom Farquharson"]}, {"page": "List of Grand Slam boys' doubles champions", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"FFF5EE\"|2010||  Justin Eleveld  Jannick Lupescu || bgcolor=\"FFF5EE\"| Duilio Beretta Roberto Quiroz  ||  Liam Broady Tom Farquharson || bgcolor=\"FFF5EE\"| Duilio Beretta Roberto Quiroz"]}, {"page": "2010 Wimbledon Championships", "response": [" Liam Broady /  Tom Farquharson def.
