During the summer break, Ainsworth rebuilt his squad, with the addition of Paul Hayes for a second spell at the club. The 2014\u201315 season saw the club spend the majority of the season in the automatic promotion places. However, two costly home defeats to Morecambe and local rivals Oxford United led to a finishing position of 4th, setting up a play-off fixture against Plymouth Argyle. The play-off final took place on 23 May and within five seconds of kick-off Wycombe midfielder Sam Saunders pulled his calf muscle and had to be substituted for Matt Bloomfield in the fourth minute. During the regular 90 minutes both teams had a goal disallowed, but neither managed to score. Four minutes into extra time Wycombe were awarded a free kick just outside the Southend penalty area. Joe Jacobson took the free kick and the ball rebounded off keeper Daniel Bentley and into the net. Southend continued to put pressure on Wycombe until Joe Pigott scored in the 122nd minute to tie the game at 1\u20131 and send it to a penalty shoot out. Southend won the shoot out 7\u20136 when Sam Wood's effort was saved by Bentley."]}, {"page": "Luke Oliver", "response": ["He signed for Wycombe in January 2009 from Stevenage Borough. Either a centre back or centre forward, Oliver is an imposing player in the air and makes good use of his size in both positions, he also shows good skill on the ball and a decent turn of pace. At the beginning of the 2009\u201310 season Oliver started as first choice centre back alongside captain Michael Duberry after an impressive pre-season, replacing Leon Johnson. Oliver joined Bradford City on a month's loan in March 2010, joining up with manager Peter Taylor once more\u00a0\u2013 who had managed Oliver at both Stevenage Borough and Wycombe.
