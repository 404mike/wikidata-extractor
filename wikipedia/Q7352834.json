An England youth international, he began his career at Ipswich Town. After being part of the FA Youth Cup winning squad of 1973, he made his first-team debut in October 1975. Despite failing to become a first-team regular, he remained at the club until 1985 when he signed for Swansea City. He scored twice on his home debut for his new club, equalling the number of league goals that he had scored in nine seasons at Ipswich, but left later in the year to return to East Anglia when he signed for Colchester United. At the end of the 1985\u201386 season he dropped into non-League football with Bury Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ipswich Town F.C.", "response": ["A number of Ipswich players appeared alongside Sylvester Stallone and Pel\u00e9 in the 1981 prisoner of war film Escape to Victory, including John Wark, Russell Osman, Robin Turner, Laurie Sivell, and Kevin O'Callaghan.

Further investigation revealed he had damaged cartilage in his knee, which required an operation.Finch, p. 86. Having had three weeks' recuperation and a cortisone injection, he was restored to the Ipswich squad in time to play in the third round UEFA Cup home leg against FC Barcelona. Ipswich won the fixture 3\u20130, and even though he suffered a reaction in his knee, he insisted he was able to play in the away leg. Robson disagreed, and Beattie was left out of the side for the game; Ipswich were knocked out on penalties.Finch, p. 87. Cortisone injections became commonplace for Beattie, who returned to the team in time for the FA Cup fourth-round victory against Hartlepool.Finch, p. 89. Although Ipswich's form in the league was poor, they were safe from relegation by the time they faced West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup semi-final at Highbury, a game for which Beattie was given the all-clear. A 3\u20131 victory saw Ipswich into the final, yet the next day his knee was once again swollen and his participation in the final was in jeopardy.Finch, p. 90. According to Beattie, \"the boss secretly told me that if I felt fit enough to play then I was in\".Finch, p. 92. Robson did not announce the Cup final team until the last minute: it included a formation change to include five midfielders and Paul Mariner as a lone striker \u2013 and Beattie in defence.Finch, pp. 93\u201394. Roger Osborne's late goal for Ipswich was the only score of the game, and they won the trophy. Beattie had three cortisone injections to get through the final.Finch, p. 100. Following the cup final success, he and teammates Robin Turner and David Geddis were awarded the freedom of Carlisle.Finch, pp. 97\u201398.

As Ipswich were in a poor run of form both domestically and in European competition, manager Bobby Robson had declared the FA Cup contest against Cardiff as \"the most important match the club is going to play this season\". Ipswich won the match 2\u20130 with both goals coming from Paul Mariner, the England international centre forward.  The match also saw captain Mick Mills making his 494th appearance for Ipswich, a club record.  Ipswich were drawn against Fourth Division Hartlepool United in the fourth round.  A controversial penalty awarded to Ipswich in the sixth minute was converted by Colin Viljoen after Derrick Downing was adjudged to have fouled Mariner.  Ipswich extended their lead with a second from Mariner before Downing pulled one back for Hartlepool.  Second half goals from Brian Talbot and Viljoen ended the tie 4\u20131 in favour of the East Anglian team who progressed to the fifth round where they faced Bristol Rovers.  The game was played on a frozen Eastville Stadium pitch and the lower league team came into the match against Ipswich having lost just two of their previous fourteen matches.  A Talbot throw-in was collected by Clive Woods whose cross was converted by Robin Turner.  Rovers' equaliser came early in the second half as Ipswich goalkeeper Paul Cooper failed to clear a corner which was subsequently headed in by midfielder David Williams.  Fifteen minutes later, the Bristol club took the lead, Williams scoring after a Russell Osman clearance.  Bobby Gould then scored for Rovers but the goal was disallowed and with four minutes to go, Mariner secured an equaliser to send the game to a replay at Portman Road.  Ipswich pressed early on but with no reward for their domination and had to wait until the 26th minute to capitalise.  A corner from Woods was converted by Mick Mills at the far post.  As Rovers went in search of an equaliser, Mariner scored following good passing work from Allan Hunter and Mills.  Woods scored a third with ten minutes remaining to end the match 3\u20130 and send Ipswich into the sixth round to face Millwall."]}, {"page": "Ronan Murray (footballer)", "response": ["Murray started playing for the Erris United youth system at the age of 12.

O'Neill was then immediately substituted by Forest manager Brian Clough for David Needham before he could complete his hat-trick.  Just three minutes before full-time, Robertson scored Forest's fifth and final goal. Ipswich's George Burley waited too long for a pass from Osman to reach him and let Robertson steal in to take the ball and strike it past Cooper from the edge of the area.

Ipswich were missing five regular players in the first leg, including Frans Thijssen and Alan Brazil, and went 1\u20130 down in the first half before goals from Mills, Robin Turner and Mariner settled the leg 3\u20131.
