He made his d\u00e9but as a replacement against the All Blacks on 5 November at the Millennium Stadium. Wales lost 3\u201341. He also played in the win over Fiji, and the defeat by South Africa. He has since played during the 2006 Six Nations Championship, and earned a further two caps in a mid-year series against Argentina. His sole appearance in the 2006 Autumn internationals was on the wing against the Pacific Islands. Byrne was a revelation in the 2008 Six Nations Championship tournament at full back and a key component of Wales' Grand Slam.\nWhile playing against Connacht in 2007, Byrne demonstrated his abilities as a stand-in kicker when he kicked two penalties and two conversions after fly-half Shaun Connor went off injured. He scored tries against England and Italy in the 2008 Six Nations Championship. Following his superb performances for Wales in the 2008 Autumn Internationals against South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia (which included a try against the latter), Byrne had been tipped not only for a place in the British & Irish Lions squad, but also a place in the starting 15. This was confirmed on 21 April 2009, when Byrne, along with Ireland's Rob Kearney, were selected as one of the British & Irish Lions' fullbacks for the tour. After the fourth tour match he was one of five players to be picked for three of them.He caused controversy again in February 2010 during the Scotland match when Scotland's coach Andy Robinson accused Byrne of diving to get substitute fly-half Phil Godman sent off and give Wales a penalty, from which they scored and went on to win the match.Given permission to seek a new club for the 2011\u201312 season, Byrne signed a three-year deal to play for French club ASM Clermont Auvergne, where he will play his club rugby post the 2011 Rugby World Cup.On 8 January 2014, it was reported that Byrne had agreed to join Newport Gwent Dragons from the end of the 2013\u201314 season.On 23 April 2015, it was announced Byrne was to retire from all rugby with immediate effect, after failing to recover from a shoulder injury.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bridgend", "response": ["* Lee Byrne (rugby player)"]}, {"page": "Ospreys (rugby union)", "response": ["On 21 April 2009, the Ospreys had six players included in the British & Irish Lions' squad for the 2009 South African tour: Lee Byrne (fullback), Tommy Bowe and Shane Williams (wings), Mike Phillips (scrum-half), Alun Wyn Jones (lock) and Adam Jones (prop).
