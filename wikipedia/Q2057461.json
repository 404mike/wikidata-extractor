It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another, and Gaskell's approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject's achievements, she concentrated on private details of Bront\u00eb's life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of \"coarseness\" that had been levelled at her writing. The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Bront\u00eb's love for H\u00e9ger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Bront\u00eb's father, widower, and friends. Mrs Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Bront\u00eb, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Bront\u00eb's diary papers, in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage.Juliet Barker, The Bront\u00ebs It has been argued that Gaskell's approach transferred the focus of attention away from the 'difficult' novels, not just Bront\u00eb's, but all the sisters', and began a process of sanctification of their private lives."]}, {"page": "Emily Bront\u00eb", "response": ["Emily Bront\u00eb was born on 30 July 1818 to Maria Branwell and an Irish father, Patrick Bront\u00eb.

Attending Cambridge may have made him think his name was too Irish, and he changed its spelling to Bront\u00eb (and its pronunciation accordingly), perhaps in honour of Horatio Nelson, whom Patrick admired. However, a more likely reason may have been that his brother, William, was 'on the run' from the authorities for his involvement with the radical United Irishmen, and he wanted to distance himself from the name Prunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806. He is the author of Cottage Poems (1811), The Rural Minstrel (1814), numerous pamphlets and newspaper articles, and various rural poems.", "thumb|Haworth parsonage soon after Patrick Bront\u00eb's death", "Patrick Bront\u00eb faced a challenge in arranging for the education of the girls of his family, which was barely middle class. They had no significant connections and he could not afford the fees for them to attend an established school for young ladies. One solution was the schools where the fees were reduced to a minimum \u2013 so called \"charity schools\" \u2013 with a mission to assist families such as those of the lower clergy. One cannot accuse Mr. Bront\u00eb of not having done everything possible to find a solution that he thought would be best for his daughters. As Barker comments, he had read in the Leeds Intelligencer of 6 November 1823 the reports of cases in the Court of Commons in Bowes, and he later read other cases decided on 24 November 1824 near Richmond, two towns in the county of Yorkshire, where pupils had been discovered gnawed by rats and suffering from malnutrition to the extent that some of them had lost their sight. There was nothing to suggest that the Reverend Carus Wilson's Clergy Daughters' School would not provide a good education and good care for his daughters. The school was not expensive, and its patrons (supporters who allowed the school to use their names) were all respected people. Among these was the daughter of Hannah More, a religious author and philanthropist who took a particular interest in education and was a close friend of the poet William Cowper, like her a proponent of a correct education for young girls. The pupils included the offspring of different prelates and even certain acquaintances of Patrick Bront\u00eb including William Wilberforce, young women whose fathers had also been educated at St John's College, Cambridge. Thus Bront\u00eb believed Wilson's school to have a number of the necessary guarantees.", "In 1829\u201330, Patrick Bront\u00eb engaged John Bradley, an artist from neighbouring Keighley, as drawing-master for the children. Bradley was an artist of some local repute, rather than a professional instructor, but he may well have fostered Branwell's enthusiasm for art and architecture.", "The children became interested in writing from an early age, initially as a game. They all displayed a talent for narrative, but for the younger ones it became a pastime to develop them. At the centre of the children's creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Bront\u00eb gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826. These toy soldiers instantly fired their imaginations and they spoke of them as the Young Men, and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form,David W. Harrison, The Brontes of Haworth pp.\u00a075\u201376.. and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence, followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created Gondal, an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831. In the beginning, these stories were written in little books, the size of a matchbox , and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes, and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children's imaginations developed, fed by reading the three weekly or monthly magazines to which their father had subscribed, or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood's local news and stationery store.", "The periodicals that Patrick Bront\u00eb read were a mine of information for his children. The Leeds Intelligencer and Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, conservative and well written, but better than the Quarterly Review that defended the same political ideas whilst addressing a less refined readership (the reason Mr. Bront\u00eb did not read it), were exploited in every detail. Blackwood's Magazine in particular, was not only the source of their knowledge of world affairs, but also provided material for the Bront\u00ebs' early writing.  For instance, an article in the June 1826 number of Blackwood\u2019s, provides commentary on new discoveries from the exploration of central Africa.   The map included with the article highlights geographical features the Bront\u00ebs reference in their tales: the Jibbel Kumera (the Mountains of the Moon), Ashantee, and the rivers Niger and Calabar.  The author also advises the British to expand into Africa from Fernando Po, where, Christine Alexander notes, the Bront\u00eb children locate the Great Glass Town.  Their knowledge of geography was completed by Goldsmith's Grammar of General Geography, which the Bront\u00ebs owned and heavily annotated.", "Conditions at the school at Cowan Bridge, where Maria and Elizabeth may have contracted the tuberculosis from which they died, were probably no worse than those at many other schools of the time. (For example, several decades before the Bront\u00eb sisters' experience at Cowan Bridge, Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra contracted typhus at a similar boarding school, and Jane nearly died. The Austen sisters' education, like that of the Bront\u00eb sisters, was continued at home.) Nevertheless, Charlotte blamed Cowan Bridge for her sisters' deaths, especially its poor medical care \u2013 chiefly, repeated emetics and blood-lettings \u2013 and the negligence of the school's doctor \u2013 who was the director's brother-in-law. Charlotte's vivid memories of the privations at Cowan Bridge were poured into her depiction of Lowood School in Jane Eyre:  the scanty and at times spoiled food, the lack of heating and adequate clothing, the periodic epidemics of illness such as \"low fever\" (probably typhus), the severity and arbitrariness of the punishments, and even the harshness of particular teachers (a Miss Andrews who taught at Cowan Bridge is thought to have been Charlotte's model for Miss Scatcherd in Jane Eyre). While Elizabeth Gaskell, a personal friend and the first biographer of Charlotte, confirmed that Cowan Bridge was Charlotte's model for Lowood and insisted that conditions there in Charlotte's day were egregious, more recent biographers have argued that the food, clothing, heating, medical care, discipline, etc. at Cowan Bridge were not considered sub-standard for religious schools of the time. One scholar has even commended Patrick Bront\u00eb for his perspicacity in removing all his daughters from the school, a few weeks before the deaths of Maria and Elizabeth.", "The Bront\u00eb sisters were highly amused by the behaviour of the curates they met. Arthur Bell Nicholls (1818\u20131906) had been curate of Haworth for seven and a half years, when contrary to all expectations, and to the fury of Patrick Bront\u00eb (their father), he proposed to Charlotte. Although impressed by his dignity and deep voice, as well as by his near complete emotional collapse when she rejected him, she found him rigid, conventional, and rather narrow-minded \"like all the curates\" \u2013 as she wrote to Ellen Nussey. After she declined his proposal, Nicholls, pursued by the anger of Patrick Bront\u00eb, left his functions for several months. However, little by little her feelings evolved and after slowly convincing her father, she finally married Nicholls on 29 June 1854.", "The first biography of Charlotte was written by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell at the request of Patrick Bront\u00eb, and published in 1857, helping to create the myth of a family of condemned genius, living in a painful and romantic solitude. After having stayed at Haworth several times and having accommodated Charlotte in Plymouth Grove, Manchester, and become her friend and confidant, Mrs Gaskell had certainly had the advantage of knowing the family.", "The death toll within the Bront\u00eb family was not unusual and left little impression on the village population, who were confronted with death on a daily basis. When Patrick Bront\u00eb arrived, the parish was suffering from unemployment. The men sought work in the quarries and local handicrafts. The only businesses were the pharmacy which supplied Branwell, and John Greenwood's stationery store in which the Bront\u00ebs were the best customers.", "The line of Patrick Bront\u00eb died out with his children, but Patrick's brother had notable descendants, including James Bront\u00eb Gatenby, whose most important work was studying Golgi bodies in various animals, including humans, and Peter Bront\u00eb Gatenby, the medical director of the UN.", "* In the French film Les S\u0153urs Bront\u00eb (1979) by Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9, Isabelle Adjani plays Emily Bront\u00eb, Marie-France Pisier plays Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Isabelle Huppert plays Anne, Patrick Magee plays Patrick Bront\u00eb, and Pascal Greggory plays Branwell Bront\u00eb."]}, {"page": "William Scoresby", "response": ["From 1839 to 1846 Scoresby was vicar of Bradford, Yorkshire, a \"large, industrial, dissenting parish\", also described as an \"ever-expanding, raucous, restless industrial conurbation\",  across.

By 1895 it was large enough to be displayed in a museum above the Yorkshire Penny Bank in Haworth. The society attracted 260 members, and about 10,000 visitors visited the museum in its first year. Sir James Roberts bought Haworth Parsonage in 1928 for \u00a33,000. He equipped it as a museum and gave it to the Bront\u00eb Society.  Henry Bonnell of Philadelphia bequeathed his collection to the society in 1926 and it was transferred to the parsonage when it opened, making it accessible to Bront\u00eb scholars. The collection has grown and been supplemented by loan materials. The society has about 2,000 members."]}, {"page": "Stella Vine", "response": ["In November 2008, it was announced that Vine had begun painting a series of new work for a large solo show at the Eden Project, Cornwall, England to be held in 2010.\"Stella Vine: Arts Hub UK\"  Arts Hub UK, 19 November 2008.
