According to author and critic Bob Woffinden, writing in 1981, the album was an example of McCartney \"continu[ing] to exasperate his audience\" before he and Wings finally won respect with the late 1973 release of Band on the Run.Woffinden, pp. 66\u201367, 81. John Pidgeon of Let It Rock found the side-two medley typical of McCartney's \"lazy\" attitude to songwriting and said: \"Red Rose Speedway sounds as if it was written after a big tea in front of the fire with carpet-slippered feet up; listening to it takes about as much as going ten rounds with a marshmallow fairy.\" Pidgeon concluded by likening the album to The Emperor's New Clothes, ruing that McCartney appeared to have no one to challenge his judgment or \"kick his arse\". Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Village Voice critic Robert Christgau derided McCartney's reliance on \"aimless whimsy\" and described the work as \"Quite possibly the worst album ever made by a rock and roller of the first rank\". In a 1977 interview, McCartney said that it typically took him a few months to listen to an album as a whole after its release; in the case of Red Rose Speedway, he said he \"couldn't stand\" it.
