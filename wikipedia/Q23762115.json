In 2013, she featured in the tenth series of The X Factor, where was mentored by Nicole Scherzinger, reaching the six-chair challenge.

However, the argument that 'the music industry is meaner' fell apart this week. [...] I refuse to believe that anyone in the music industry has even been given a contract, told they're brilliant and then forced to watch 15 other people sing and have that contract ripped up in front of their faces. And even if they have, I bet they didn't have an audience of 4,000 people chanting at them to be on their way. This was reality TV at its most cruel.\" He wondered if the change was a \"desperate attempt to create interest in a series that has performed solidly in the ratings, but without creating any real talking points or memorable moments\", and said that \"watching Karen Harding, Lydia Lucy and Sheena McHugh get put into the Top 6 and then have the dream of a spot at Judges' Houses snatched away from them felt needlessly mean. Whether the trio deserved to make Judges' Houses or not felt irrelevant. The audience finger-pointing and the chanting of 'Swap! Swap! Swap!' made the whole process terribly ugly.\" He questioned the show's producers' \"need to make it even more vicious\", opined that the new twist \"definitely undermines the credibility of the show's judges\", and said, \"The whole twist felt contrived and unpleasant, and I hope it won't be returning in 2014.\"", "Fans and viewers of the show also criticised the bootcamp format, with some viewers said to be fearing for the contestants' wellbeing, with one calling it \"blood sport\". Singer Lily Allen, who watched the show, said, \"When did become alright to fuck with people's minds. X Factor has got fully mean.\" Contestant Lydia Lucy, who was initially chosen to be in Scherzinger's final six but was replaced by Abi Alton, said, \"It still hasn't sunk in. I've been absolutely devastated. [...] If Simon Cowell was in front of me now I'd tell him to change the format back to how it was. This way is like dangling a carrot in front of someone and then taking it away.\""]}, {"page": "List of The Voice UK contestants", "response": ["| Lydia Lucy"]}]}}
