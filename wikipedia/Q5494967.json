A wing half, he also played for Soho Villa, Birmingham St George's and Nottingham Forest.Davis was born in Smethwick, Staffordshire, and played as a wing half for local clubs including Soho Villa and Birmingham St George's before in 1893 signing for Woolwich Arsenal, who had just become the first club from the south of England to join the Football League. He made his league debut for the side in their second-ever league match, a 3\u20132 defeat away to Notts County on 9 September 1893. He was a near ever-present for the 1893\u201394 season (missing only one more game) and continued to do so for the four seasons after that.With Davis in the side Woolwich Arsenal mainly occupied mid-table of the Second Division, reaching as high as fifth in 1897\u201398. After the end of the 1898\u201399 season Davis left Arsenal to join First Division Nottingham Forest. He had played exactly 150 games for Arsenal in six seasons, scoring ten goals.
