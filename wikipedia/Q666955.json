He was mostly known, both professionally and socially, by his middle-name as Francis Hemming.\nHemming was a British civil servant and amateur lepidopterist. An expert in biological nomenclature, he served from 1937 to 1958 as Secretary to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature and was founder and editor of the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature. Over his lifetime he published more than 1,000 scientific papers on Lepidoptera. His manuscripts and other papers are deposited in the Natural History Museum in London and at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.\nHemming was educated at Rugby School, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. During World War I he was severely wounded in 1916, and in 1918 he joined the British Civil Service. He was private secretary to several ministers and was granted the C.M.G. and C.B.E. for his services, especially in the revision of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (often jokingly referred to as the Hemming Code) that was officially adopted in 1958.\nThe genus Nabokovia (Lycaenidae) was named by Hemming in 1960, in honor of the novelist and entomologist Vladimir Nabokov, whose earlier generic name was found by Hemming to be a junior homonym. Nabokov invited Hemming to provide the substitute name.First married to Vera Montague Murray in 1924 (marriage dissolved in 1932) with whom he had one son, Christopher Francis Hemming. Second marriage to novelist Marjorie McLean Firminger (Jam To-Day, 1930) on 1 June 1933, third marriage in 1947 to Margaret Francis Waley Joseph (b. April 29, 1910), with whom he had two daughters, Rachel Cecilia Waley Hemming (b. 1947) and Judith Frances Waley Hemming (b. 1948).\nHemming won international recognition for his decades of dedicated service to zoological nomenclature and to entomology.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Passenger pigeon", "response": ["In 1827 William John Swainson moved the passenger pigeon from the genus Columba to the new monotypic genus Ectopistes, due in part to the length of the wings and the wedge shape of the tail. In 1906 Outram Bangs suggested that because Linnaeus had wholly copied Catesby's text when coining C.\u00a0macroura, this name should apply to the passenger pigeon, as E.\u00a0macroura. In 1918 Harry C. Oberholser suggested that C.\u00a0canadensis should take precedence over C.\u00a0migratoria (as E.\u00a0canadensis), as it appeared on an earlier page in Linnaeus' book. In 1952 Francis Hemming proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) secure the specific name macroura for the mourning dove, and the name migratorius for the passenger pigeon, since this was the intended use by the authors on whose work Linnaeus had based his description. This was accepted by the ICZN, which used its plenary powers to designate the species for the respective names in 1955."]}, {"page": "Mourning dove", "response": ["To resolve the confusion over the binomial names of the two species, Francis Hemming proposed in 1952 that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) secure the specific name macroura for the mourning dove and migratorius for the passenger pigeon, since this was the intended use by the authors on whose work Linnaeus had based his description.

Its main issue was a second possible solution to the problem, seemingly overlooked by Corbet, that would secure nomenclatural stability. Other than suppressing the name ajax, it would also be possible to select a new type for the name, which would preserve the name for the Nearctic species to which it had been applied for some time.
