Silver is a British physicist whose discoveries have included a new way to change the curvature of lenses, with a significant application for the low-cost manufacture of corrective lenses and adjustable spectacles, especially in low-income countries.\nSilver began his academic career in the Department of Atomic and Laser Physics at the University of Oxford, ultimately leading a research group. Professor Silver is currently the chief executive of the Centre for Vision in the Developing World at the University of Oxford, working to research the scope of and potential solutions to the problems of refractive error and low vision in the developing world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glasses", "response": ["In the early 20th century, Moritz von Rohr and Zeiss (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld) developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, Joshua Silver designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by using a built-in syringe to pump a silicone solution into a flexible lens."]}, {"page": "1985 in science", "response": ["* March\u2013May \u2013 Joshua Silver develops an adjustable corrective lens."]}, {"page": "Joshua silver", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joshua Silver "]}, {"page": "Joshua D Silver", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joshua Silver"]}, {"page": "Adjustable-focus eyeglasses", "response": ["Another type of opto-mechanical lens is the design of Joshua Silver, and uses liquid pressure against a diaphragm to control focus of a lens.US patent is Berreman 4,190,330 These lenses were meant to provide improved vision without prescription by an optometrist, since these professionals are in short supply in many countries.
