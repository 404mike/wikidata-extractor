Francis Dale stepped down as commissioner of the MISL and the Wings' own Bill Kentling took his place. When Kentling went to the new league headquarters in New York City, it was decided that Roy Turner was the logical choice to replace him. Turner stepped down as head coach and was named President of the Wings. The changes continued when Frank Carney decided to step down as managing general partner. William \"Bill\" Oliver Jr. took his place at the top of the Wings' power structure. Replacing Turner as coach was an important and difficult task. The team convinced Scottish legend Charlie Cooke, the \"Bonnie Prince,\" to fill Turner's shoes. Cooke instituted an up-tempo style that emphasized defensive pressure. It wasn't always popular with the older veterans. In 1986-87, the Wings added the young forward Mark Kerlin from Arizona and the Welsh superstar Mickey Thomas of Chelsea and Manchester United fame. A rookie from California named Dale Ervine would have the biggest long-term impact. At the end of his eight years in Wichita, \"The Bruin\" would be second on the all-time goals scored list. The Wings would lose in the division semifinals to Tacoma in 1987 after finishing the season with a 27-25 record.", "In 1987-88, the Wings brought in Nenad \"Ziggy\" Zigante to replace Seamus McDonagh in goal. Former US Olympian Jean Willrich and longtime indoor pro Mike Stankovic also joined the squad in Charlie Cooke's second year. But it was a season that Cooke himself would not finish. On January 30, 1988, Cooke and assistant coach Norman Piper were fired after starting the year 11-16. Former Wing Terry Nicholl would take over as head coach, with Kevin Kewley adding \"assistant coach\" to his duties on the field. Though the Wings would have their worst ever season, finishing 23-33, two Wings would end up leading the MISL.

He made more than 125 league appearances for Hamilton before leaving in 1960 to join Clyde. After playing in over 100 league games for Clyde, McLean was transferred to Dundee for \u00a310,000 in 1965. This move meant him becoming a full-time professional footballer for the first time in his career, aged 27. His debut for Dundee came at Dens Park on 11 September 1965 when Dundee were beaten 5\u20130 by Dundee United, their heaviest ever defeat in a Dundee derby. In his first season with Dundee, McLean scored eight goals, and he became their principal threat in attack after Charlie Cooke was sold to Chelsea in April 1966. McLean scored 17 goals for Dundee during the 1966\u201367 season, which made him the club's leading scorer. He followed this by scoring 18 goals in the 1967\u201368 season, during which Dundee reached the Scottish League Cup final (losing 5\u20133 to Celtic) and the Fairs Cup semi-final (losing 2\u20131 on aggregate to Leeds United)."]}]}}
