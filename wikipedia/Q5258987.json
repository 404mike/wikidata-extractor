Mitcham's sixteen was bolstered by the inclusion of three guest players, one of them Bill Stirling. The other two were Surrey wicketkeeper Dennis Sullivan, who was born in Mitcham, and amateur Burnett Bullock, who was \"mine host\" at the public house opposite the ground that now bears his name. Mitcham batted first and scored 200 all out, their captain Howard Lacey making the top score with 39. Trenerry and Collins shared twelve of the fifteen wickets while Gregory was bowled sparingly. The AIF included a couple of players from their second eleven but they won easily by five wickets, though Stirling took the wickets of Murray and Docker cheaply."]}, {"page": "Percy Evans", "response": ["Evans made a significant contribution, when on debut against Glamorgan he took 3-84, dismissing Dai Davies, Frank Ryan and Dennis Sullivan."]}, {"page": "Dennis Sullivan (disambiguation)", "response": ["Dennis Sullivan is an American mathematician.", "Dennis Sullivan may also refer to:", "*Dennis Sullivan (cricketer) (1883\u20131968), cricketer", "*Dennis Sullivan, producer of Pork, a political talk show on the America's Talking network"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Dennis Sullivan (1922\u20131928) : D.
