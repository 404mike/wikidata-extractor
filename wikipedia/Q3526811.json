In this role he developed his batting to such an extent that for a brief period he became an England regular and even captained them in one match as a deputy for Bob Wyatt. However, he unexpectedly completely gave up cricket soon after that, to the dismay of his country and county.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 28", "response": ["*1905 \u2013 Cyril Walters, Welsh-English cricketer (d. 1992)"]}, {"page": "Neath", "response": ["*Cyril Walters (1905\u20131992), Glamorgan cricketer and Captain of the England cricket team;"]}, {"page": "Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)", "response": ["O'Reilly shook English confidence in the Third Test, played on a placid surface at Old Trafford, by taking three wickets in four balls. Cyril Walters, who up to that point had been untroubled, failed to pick the bosie and thus inside edged the ball to short leg.McHarg, p. 101. Bob Wyatt came in and was clean bowled for a golden duck, bringing Hammond in to face the hat-trick ball. The new batsman inside edged the ball past the stumps and through the legs of wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, but the next delivery clean bowled him. This left England at 3/72, and O'Reilly removed Sutcliffe soon after, but the batsmen settled down and the next wicket did not come until Hendren fell just before the end of the first day's play. England were 5/355 and O'Reilly had taken each wicket.McHarg, pp. 101\u2013102. The next day, the hosts ended on 9/627, despite a relentless 59 overs from O'Reilly, who ended with 7/189 and was the only bowler to challenge the batsmen.McHarg, p. 102. The high-scoring match never looked likely to produce a result,Wisden (1935), pp. 33\u201335. except when Australia were in danger of being forced to follow on. They were 55 runs away from the follow on mark of 478 at the end of the third day with two wickets in hand, and O'Reilly was on one. The next day Arthur Chipperfield fell with 24 runs still needed and O'Reilly and Wall saw them to 491 before the latter fell. O'Reilly ended with 30 not out after an innings in which he was lucky not to be caught off an edge multiple times.McHarg, pp. 102\u2013103."]}, {"page": "1933 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Fred Bakewell, George Headley, Stan Nichols, Leslie Townsend, Cyril Walters"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Cyril Walters"]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Worcestershire were so weak the club could not compete in the Championship in 1919, and their form in 1920 \u2013 when they lost three successive games by an innings and over 200 runs \u2013 was probably the worst of any county side.
