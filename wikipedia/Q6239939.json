The woman, who was 16 in 1978, later testified that during a lesson Pickett told her to take her top off and lie down in a darkened practice room to \"improve her breathing\", on later occasions sexually assaulting and raping her. Police arrested Pickett on 4 December 2013, after which further victims came forward. His arrest was not part of the high-profile sex crime investigation Operation Yewtree.  It was said at his trial that allegations against Pickett dated back to 1984, when a family complained to the school about him attacking their 17-year-old daughter; they were allegedly told by the school that she should have her lessons elsewhere as no one else had complained.  Police discovered evidence within the archives of the school that in 1984 the then principal John Hosier had written to Pickett, asking him to discuss the allegations. Hosier passed police a letter regarding the allegations and his frustrations, but the following year the Guildhall School made Pickett a fellow."]}, {"page": "Biddy Baxter", "response": ["Her final programme in the role of editor aired on 27 June 1988.
