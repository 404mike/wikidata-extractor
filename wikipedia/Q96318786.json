Government documents refer to him at different times as a civil, mechanical and mining engineer, reflecting the breadth of his work. He is mainly known for inventing the Heaton process, a way to convert cast iron into steel, and his subsequent legal battles with fellow Englishman Henry Bessemer, who had developed a different method for the same conversion. He later obtained a patent regarding efficiency improvements in steam boilers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ironsand", "response": ["Ironsand had moderate, localized uses in China during the late Industrial Revolution, but was a rather unimportant commodity throughout the long history of the Chinese iron-industry. Unlike the rest of Eurasia and Africa, there is very little archeological evidence to suggest that bloomery smelting was used in ancient China.Still the Iron Age: Iron and Steel in the Modern World by Vaclav Smil -- Elsevier 2016 Page 6 The Chinese countryside was rich in deposits of both an iron ore containing a high content of phosphorus, and coal, a fuel that burns at a high temperature. Around 1200 BC the Chinese developed a method of smelting the rocky ore into pig iron, which was then remelted and poured into molds (cast) to form cast iron. Although the metal was very brittle, this method was able to produce iron in much greater volumes than bloomery smelting, and with vastly higher yields of metal per ore. By the 1st century BC the Chinese iron-industry was by far the largest and most advanced in the world. By the 1st century AD they had developed puddling for the production of mild steel, crucible steel for the manufacture of things like swords and weapons, and a chemical process of rapidly decarburizing liquid pig-iron to make wrought iron, using the oxidation properties of saltpeter (called the Heaton process, it was independently discovered by John Heaton in the 1860s).Scientific American -- Conversion of cast iron into wrought iron China remained the world's largest producer of iron until the 11th century, manufacturing large quantities of relatively affordable steel and iron.The Traditional Chinese Iron Industry and its Modern Fate by Donald B WagnerScience and Civilisation in China: Volume 5 by Joseph Needham -- Page 345"]}, {"page": "John Heaton", "response": ["John Heaton may refer to:", "* John Heaton (metallurgist) (1818-1897), British metallurgist", "* John Heaton (athlete) (1908\u20131976), American bobsledder and skeleton racer", "* John Heaton (psychotherapist), cofounder of the Philadelphia Association in 1965", "* John Heaton (The Bill), a character on The Bill", "* John Heaton-Armstrong (1888\u20131967), British government administrator"]}, {"page": "Heaton process", "response": ["John Heaton developed this process using nitrates to oxidize the 2-5% carbon in cast iron and convert it to steel.", "In 1869, when John Heaton published 'Heaton's Process for the Treatment of Cast Iron and the Manufacture of Steel', cast iron was a readily available material, but converting it to steel was a slow, expensive, laborious process. At the time, there was an already-known laboratory-scale process of adding \"nitre\" to cast iron in order to produce oxygen and burn off the carbon, producing steel. John Heaton formalized a process (specifying sodium nitrate instead of potassium) and designed equipment which made the comingling of the nitrate and the liquid cast iron reliable and repeatable, something that had until then been impractical. Combined, these improvements became the Heaton process. Another English metallurgist, Henry Bessemer had just created the Bessemer process of blowing air or pure oxygen through liquid cast iron to burn off the carbon."]}, {"page": "John Heaton (Metallurgist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Heaton (metallurgist)"]}]}}
