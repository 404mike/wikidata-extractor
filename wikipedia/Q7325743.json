Cinema 16 held monthly programs of experimental and documentary films and its success inspired smaller film societies in other locations, particularly college towns. For instance, Art in Cinema was presented at the San Francisco Museum of Art which was organised by Richard Foster and Frank Stauffacher. In the 1950s, Perry Miller\u2019s Film Advisory Center sponsored several Art Film Festivals in New York City to present experimental animation created by Mary Ellen Bute, Douglass Crockwell and Francis Lee, as well as documentaries about artists and art."]}]}}
