More usually seen on the left wearing shirt number 11, in 1988 he switched to the right (and shirt number 14) to accommodate Chris Oti: in 1990 on the right opposite Mark Bailey, but on the left when partnering Simon Halliday, continuing on the left in 1991 opposite Nigel Heslop: in the 1991 World Cup he played on the right in partnership with Oti early on, then on the left in partnership with Heslop until the quarter-final and Halliday for the final two rounds, an arrangement that persisted throughout the 1992 Five Nations championship \u2013 which was initially billed as his final season before retirement, Underwood scoring tries in each of the first three matches of the championship, and coming close to scoring against Wales. However, Underwood changed his mind and opted to carry on, initially for the next match against South Africa (their first match since their readmission to international sport), and eventually for several more years \u2013 playing mostly now on the left, to accommodate his younger brother, Tony, on the right wing.  They were the first brothers to represent England at the same time since 1937: and, in the 1993 match against Scotland, the first pair of brothers to score tries in the same match for England. He has been described as one of the greatest wingers to ever play the game."]}, {"page": "Wasps RFC", "response": ["| Rob Andrew, Chris Oti, Jeff Probyn, Paul Rendall", "* 1989: Rob Andrew, Chris Oti"]}, {"page": "England national rugby union team", "response": ["Swing Low, Sweet Chariot is very commonly sung at England fixtures \u2013 especially at Twickenham. In the last match of the 1988 season, against Ireland, three of England's tries were scored by Chris Oti.

In 1991 the RFU marketing director Mike Coley for the team to launch a song leading up to that year's Rugby World Cup.

The Twickenham crowd had only seen one solitary England try in the previous two years, and at half-time, they were 0\u20133 down against the Irish. During the second half, a remarkable transformation took place and England started playing an expansive game many had doubted they were capable of producing. A 0\u20133 deficit was turned into a 35\u20133 win, with England scoring six tries. This day also saw the origins of the adoption of the traditional spiritual \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" as a terrace song. In the 35\u20133 win against Ireland, three of England's tries were scored by Chris Oti, a black player who had made a reputation for himself that season as a speedster on the left wing. A group of boys from the Benedictine school Douai, following a tradition at their school games, sang \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" whenever a try was scored. When Oti scored his second try, amused spectators standing close to the boys joined in, and when Oti scored his hat-trick the song was heard around the ground. Since then \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" has been a song to sing at England home games, in the same way that Fields of Athenry is sung in Dublin and Cwm Rhondda is sung in Cardiff."]}, {"page": "David Campese", "response": ["Campese scored two tries against England and received praise for his defence on his opposite England winger Chris Oti.", "Campese scored his first try in the 29th minute of the Test when Australian captain and scrum-half Nick Farr-Jones executed a \"box kick\" that exposed England's outside backs following a \"22 drop-out.\" Campese out-sprinted his opposite winger Chris Oti, received a favourable bounce to regather the ball, and scored the try near the corner flag."]}, {"page": "1989 British Lions tour to Australia", "response": ["|Chris Oti "]}, {"page": "Nottingham R.F.C.", "response": ["*  Chris Oti"]}, {"page": "Nigeria national rugby union team", "response": ["*Chris Oti - England"]}, {"page": "Nigel Heslop", "response": ["Nigel Heslop represented England on ten occasions between 1990-1992, playing in two of the matches of the 1991 Rugby World Cup, including a very physical encounter with France. He was a member of England's 1991 5 Nations Grand Slam winning side, scoring a try against the Scots at Twickenham in the Calcutta Cup match of that year. He was surprisingly dropped for the first two matches of the World Cup, in favour of Chris Oti: marked his return with a try in the third and final group-stage match against the USA: but emerged from the quarter-final against France considerably battered and bruised. Although he completed the match he was not judged fit to start in either the semi-final or final, and with Oti also injured, Heslop's place on the wing was taken by the squad's utility-back replacement, Simon Halliday - who more usually played centre. Heslop took a place on the bench for both matches but was not called on to play. England kept the World Cup Final back line in place throughout the 1992 season, keeping Heslop on the bench: his final international appearance was in the last match of that season, coming on as a replacement for Carling in the final few minutes. Thus the match, and his career, finished with the brief and incongruous situation of Heslop (a specialist winger) playing in the centre, while Halliday (a specialist centre) played on the wing in Heslop's usual position."]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union team records", "response": ["|align=left| Chris Oti || Wing || 58-3 ||align=left|  ||align=left|  1989 England Tour ||align=left| 13 May 1989"]}]}}
