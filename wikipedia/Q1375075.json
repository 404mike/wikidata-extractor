He then studied under landscape engraver W.B. Cooke along with his nephew William Edward Shuckard. Together they took an interest in insects, especially the ants and bees. In 1841, following the death of William Bainbridge, he became a curator of the collections and the library of the Entomological Society of London. As an engraver he produced copies based on the works of Turner, Constable and David Roberts. He also worked with Gray arranging Hymenoptera in the British Museum. In 1849 he succeeded Edward Doubleday as a member of the zoologicy department. He then gave up his art work but produced the plates for Wollaston's Insecta Maderensia (1854) and for papers in the Transactions of the Entomological Society. In 1875, he was promoted to Assistant Keeper of Zoology. His publications included Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects (7 parts, 1853\u20131859) and parts 5 (1851) and 6 (1852) of the Nomenclature of Coleopterous Insects. In these volumes, he catalogued hundreds of bees. Many of these bees he named including Bombus frigidus, Halictus coriaceus, and Nomia nasalis, which he discovered.Smith was president of the Entomological Society of London, 1862\u20133.\nHe died on 16 February 1879 after undergoing a surgery for gallstones. He was buried at Finchley Cemetery.His son was Edgar Albert Smith (1847\u20131916), zoologist and malacologist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Frederick Smith (1805\u20131879), British entomologistAbbreviation in zoology: F.

Fabricius incorrectly listed the type locality as India, as these ants are only found in Central and South America. In 1804, P.\u00a0clavata was transferred to the genus Ponera by the French zoologist Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille. The genus Paraponera was established by the British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858, and P.\u00a0clavata was designated as the type species by monotypy (the condition of a taxonomic group having only a single taxon described). In his book, Smith would synonymise multiple taxa under Paraponera clavata, including Formica armata, Formica spininoda, Ponera tarsalis and Ponera clavata. Later publications would also synonymise more taxa, including Formica aculeata and Formica clavata. The genus was placed in a monotypic tribe, the Paraponerini, in 1901 by the Italian entomologist Carlo Emery, who stressed the importance of certain morphological characteristics of Paraponera; Emery had also placed the tribe close to the Ectatommini. This classification was accepted by the entomological community until 1958, where the American entomologist William Brown Jr. synonymised Paraponerini and transferred Paraponera to Ectatommini. It was treated as a valid tribe in 1994, but in 2003, the English myrmecologist elevated the rank of the tribe to subfamily level as Paraponerinae, being a part of the Poneromorph subfamilies."]}, {"page": "Formica rufibarbis", "response": ["The name Formica rufibarbis was first given to this ant by Lord Avebury in Britain in his 1881 work Ants, Bees and Wasps although the species had been earlier misidentified as F. cunicularia by Frederick Smith in 1851."]}, {"page": "1866 in science", "response": ["* Frederick Smith first discovers Formica candida in the Bournemouth district of England, describing it as Formica gagates."]}, {"page": "Outline of ants", "response": ["* Frederick Smith (1805 - 1879)"]}, {"page": "Fred Smith", "response": ["Fred, Frederic, or Frederick Smith may refer to:", "*Frederick Smith, 3rd Earl of Birkenhead (1936\u20131985), British peer and author", "*Frederick Smith, 2nd Viscount Hambleden (1868\u20131928), British MP", "*Frederick Smith (Australian politician) (1883\u20131960), Australian politician, government minister in Western Australia", "*Frederick Smith (barrister) (1924\u20132016), Attorney General of Barbados and Chief Justice of Turks and Caicos", "*Frederick Smith (lawyer) (1773\u20131830), Pennsylvania lawyer, state Attorney General, state Supreme Court Justice", "*Sir Frederick Smith (Conservative MP) (1790\u20131874), British general and colonel-commandant of the Royal Engineers, and Conservative MP for Chatham", "*Frederick Smith (footballer), English football player at outside right with Stockport County, Darlington, Exeter City and Gillingham in the 1930s", "*Frederick Smith (Somerset cricketer) (1854\u20131894), English cricketer", "*Frederick Smith (Barbadian cricketer) (1837-1923), Barbadian cricketer", "*Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead (1907\u20131975), British historian", "*Frederick Smith (entomologist) (1805\u20131879), British entomologist", "*Frederick Smith, 1st Baron Colwyn (1859\u20131946), British businessman", "*Frederick Smith, 2nd Baron Colwyn (1914\u20131966), stockbroker and British Army officer"]}, {"page": "Asian giant hornet", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederick Smith (entomologist)"]}, {"page": "Myrmecia (ant)", "response": ["Myrmecia has been classified into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858, British entomologist Frederick Smith placed it in the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae.

This classification was short-lived as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established the Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified them as a subfamily in 1858. He again treated them as a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated the Poneridae as a subfamily and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera but later placed it in the Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in the Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler.

There, Smith described the specimens of a worker, queen, and male. The type specimen is located in the British Museum in London. In 1922, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler established the subgenus Halmamyrmecia characterised by its jumping behaviour, of which the jack jumper ant was designated as the type species. However, John Clark later synonymised Halmamyrmecia under the subgenus Promyrmecia in 1927 and placed the ant in the subgenus in 1943.

Some twelve years later his parents removed to London, where he received most of his education. After attending one or two preparatory schools, in 1853 he entered St. John's Foundation School which was then at Kilburn. At the age of seventeen he commenced to help his father, a leather merchant, and about the same time he began collecting beetles, some of his favourite haunts being Ken Wood and Hammersmith Marshes, as well as the sandy shores about Deal and Dover. Lacking an interest in business life, he choose to pursue a career in medicine. He accordingly, after studying for two years at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, went to the University of Edinburgh, where he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Medicine in 1866. After graduation he assisted a friend with his practice in London for a year or two. He had at first some thought of seeking an appointment in connection with entomology at the British Museum, but abandoned the idea; and about ten years later he went so far as to apply for the post of Curator of the City of Glasgow Industrial Museum, being recommended by H.W. Bates and Frederick Smith amongst others. However, after his short residence in London he was offered a post as medical officer in the Crichton Asylum at Dumfries, which led to his taking charge of a case at Thornhill in the neighbourhood, where he joined the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Scientific, Natural History, and Antiquarian Society upon its reconstruction in 1876. This engagement gave him the leisure he desired for prosecuting the studies on which his heart was set, and it was during this period that he published some of his earlier papers. It was also here that his marriage took place. In 1883, upon the death of a wealthy patient, William Cunninghame Graham Bontine (1825-1883), to whom he served as a special medical attendant, he returned to England. Bontine had been injured on the head by an Irishman during the Irish famine. The injury led to serious mental issues and the patient was declared \"insane\" and admitted to the Crichton Royal Institution. Sharp initially went to live at Southampton, but, finding it too far from London, after about two years he removed to Dartford. In 1885 he was invited to go to Cambridge as Curator of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology. There he spent the next nineteen years of his life, till in 1909, when he retired to Brockenhurst, where he had built a residence, Lawnside, on the very edge of the New Forest, facing the extensive heath of Black Knowl where he resided till his death on 27 August 1922."]}, {"page": "Apis andreniformis", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederick Smith (entomologist)"]}, {"page": "Apis laboriosa", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederick Smith (entomologist)"]}, {"page": "Apis nigrocincta", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederick Smith (entomologist)"]}, {"page": "Bombus fraternus", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Frederick Smith (entomologist)"]}, {"page": "Edgar Albert Smith", "response": ["His father was Frederick Smith, a well-known entomologist, and assistant keeper of zoology in the British Museum, Bloomsbury.
