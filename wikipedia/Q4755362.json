Now the Chef-Patron, and owner, of Simpsons, one of Birmingham's four Michelin starred restaurants, and The Cross in Kenilworth, Warwickshire. Antona was a mentor to several other successful Birmingham chefs early in their careers, including Glynn Purnell, Luke Tipping and Andy Waters, and has been described in The Times as \"the godfather of modern Birmingham food\".Antona was born in Cuckfield, West Sussex to a Greek-Cypriot family, and was brought up in Chiswick, London. He trained initially at Ealing Technical College, after which he spent six years working in hotels in Germany and Switzerland - before working under Anton Mosimann at The Dorchester and at the Ritz Hotel. From 1987 he spent three years as Head Chef at Birmingham's Plough and Harrow Hotel, at a time when its restaurant was among the finest in the Midlands.Antona originally opened Simpsons in Kenilworth, Warwickshire in September 1993, the restaurant's name being taken from that of the chemists shop owned by his father-in-law that used to occupy the property. Simpsons was awarded a Michelin Star in 1999 and moved to a grade II-listed Georgian villa in Edgbaston, Birmingham in 2004, by which time it had built a European-wide reputation.Since then, Antona has opened a second restaurant in Kenilworth, The Cross, which was awarded a Michelin Star in 2014 just shortly after opening. Andreas is now part of the team behind Pure Bar & Kitchen in Birmingham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Food and drink in Birmingham", "response": ["During the late 1980s, the restaurant of The Plough And Harrow Hotel in Hagley Road in Edgbaston was considered to be one of Birmingham's finest dining venues. Andreas Antona was head chef at The Plough And Harrow from 1987 for three years before opening Simpson's in Kenilworth in 1993 (see below). The Plough And Harrow is situated in a building dating back to 1704.", "In 2004, Andreas Antona opened Simpson's Restaurant in Edgbaston Birmingham, within a Grade II-listed building. Antona founded the original Simpson's in Kenilworth in 1993, which was awarded a Michelin star in the Michelin Guide Great Britain and Ireland 2000. Chef Director Luke Tipping had previously been Chef at Simpson's in Kenilworth. Andreas Antona was later to establish a restaurant at The Cross in Kenilworth where the Head Chef is Adam Bennett, who had worked for Antona at Simpson's in Kenilworth and subsequently, has been Head Chef in the Edgbaston restaurant. The name \"Simpson's\" was taken from the chemist's shop, belonging to Antona's father-in-law, which occupied the site in Kenilworth before Antona opened his restaurant there. After the Edgbaston restaurant had been closed for a short period for redecoration towards the end of 2015, Nathan Eades, who previously had had his own restaurant for a short while in nearby Bromsgrove, took over as Head Chef from Matt Cheal who left to open his own restaurant, \"Cheal's of Henley\" in the village of Henley in Arden, between Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. Nathan Eades left Simpson's in December 2017 to work at the 'Wild Rabbit Inn' in Kingham. Previously, Andy Waters, another former Head Chef of Simpsons, had had a restaurant, \"Edmund's\", in Henley in Arden before moving it to Birmingham and then going on to open \"Waters In The Square\" at Five Ways and then the restaurant \"Andy Waters\" at Resorts World at the National Exhibition Centre. In November 2018 Waters announced that he was giving up his role at the Resorts World restaurant and Aaron Darnley became Head Chef there with the restaurant's name being changed to 'Sky By Waters'. Andy Waters became Head Chef at \u2018Pebble Beach\u2019 restaurant in Barton-on-Sea in Hampshire in October 2019. Cheal's of Henley received the Judges Choice Award in the Birmingham Food, Drink And Hospitality Awards in June 2016. Corin Ireland of Simpsons was named Best Sommelier in the same awards. In 2018 PETA (The People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals Foundation) included Simpsons in a list of the 10 best restaurants to serve vegan food in Britain. Luke Tipping was appointed Honorary Professor of Culinary Arts at University College Birmingham in 2010. At one time Simpson's had three winners of the 'British Culinary Federation Chef Of The Year' award - Luke Tipping, Adam Bennett and Matt Cheal - all working there at the same time."]}, {"page": "Glynn Purnell", "response": ["Purnell's career in fine dining started in 1996 when he joined Andreas Antona at Simpsons restaurant \u2013 then based in Kenilworth, Warwickshire \u2013 as chef de partie.
