By now the original band had broken up and a new lineup was in place, consisting of Phil Spalding, Nigel Glocker and Adrian Lee, only Joel Bogen remaining and Toyah. 1981 saw Willcox's strengthened presence in the charts with hits such as Four from Toyah EP (no. 4, February 1981, including \"It's a Mystery\"), the third album Anthem that went to no. 2 in May 1981 to be later certified platinum, \"I Want to Be Free\" (no. 8, June 1981), \"Thunder in the Mountains\" (no. 4, October 1981) and Four More from Toyah EP (no. 14, November 1981). She became one of the first acts to score regularly in the UK Singles Chart with EPs, which were also successful on an international level. At the end of the year Willcox won the Smash Hits' reader's poll in two categories: Best Female Singer and Most Fanciable Female (beating Kim Wilde to the second place).

Despite initial objections by Gouldman, Mirror Mirror included an acoustic version of \"I'm Not in Love\" which became a No.\u00a029 UK hit single, but overall the album did not fare very well. Gouldman has described Mirror Mirror as \"almost like two-halves of an album\", largely a result of the fact that he and Stewart recorded in separate countries. \"I don't like to say we hoodwinked the people, but you could say it's not quite what it appears to be, and anyone with any sense, who reads the credits, could see that,\" he told Goldmine magazine.
