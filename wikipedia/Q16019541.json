He developed an emergency stroke ambulance service with early neuroimaging, allowing for the detection of early reversible brain damage. In 1974, he established what would later be known as the Princess Margaret Migraine Clinic, a specialist clinic for headache at Charing Cross Hospital, where in 1965 he became their first appointed consultant neurologist.\nRose completed early neurological training at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen Square, followed by placements in the United States, Paris, and then at St George's Hospital at Hyde Park Corner and Atkinson Morley Hospital. He subsequently held several consultant posts in London.\nHe was the secretary-treasurer general of the World Federation of Neurology (WFN), the first editor-in-chief of World Neurology, founding editor of the Journal of the History of the Neurosciences, and founding chair of the WFN's Research Group on the History of the Neurosciences.
