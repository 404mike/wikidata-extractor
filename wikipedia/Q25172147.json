After having served as a stoker on several ships, on 6 April 1912, he was hired on board the RMS Titanic as lead stoker. On April 15, 1912, while the ship was sinking, Barrett boarded lifeboat No. 13 and took command of it, thus surviving the disaster. He later testified before commissions of inquiry into the sinking of the ship and continued to work in the navy until the 1920s. In 1923, after losing his wife Mary Anne Jones, he remained in Liverpool and worked ashore as a logger.\nHe died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William McMaster Murdoch", "response": ["Fourth Officer Boxhall testified that Murdoch set the ship's telegraph to \"Full Astern\", but Greaser Frederick Scott and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett testified that the stoking indicators went from \"Full\" to \"Stop\". During or right before the collision, Quartermaster Alfred Olliver (who was walking onto the bridge during the collision) testified that he heard Murdoch give the order \"Hard a'port\" (moving the tiller all the way to the port (left) side turning the ship to starboard (right)) in what may have been an attempt to swing the remainder (aft section) away from the berg in a common manoeuvre called a \"port around\" (this could explain his comment to the captain \"I intended to port around it\"). The fact that such a manoeuvre was executed was supported by other crew members who testified that the stern of the ship never hit the iceberg. The orders that Murdoch gave to avoid the iceberg are debated. According to Oliver, Murdoch ordered the helm \"hard to port\" to ward off the stern of the iceberg. Hichens and Boxhall made no mention of the order. However, since the stern avoided the iceberg, it is likely that the order was given and carried out."]}]}}
