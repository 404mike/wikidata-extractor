Art bienniales are held in Dakar, Senegal, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Many contemporary African artists are represented in museum collections, and their art may sell for high prices at art auctions. Despite this, many contemporary African artists tend to have a difficult time finding a market for their work. Many contemporary African arts borrow heavily from traditional predecessors. Ironically, this emphasis on abstraction is seen by Westerners as an imitation of European and American Cubist and totemic artists, such as Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Matisse, who, in the early twentieth century, were heavily influenced by traditional African art. This period was critical to the evolution of Western modernism in visual arts, symbolized by Picasso's breakthrough painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon."]}, {"page": "Murray Edwards College, Cambridge", "response": ["* Lubaina Himid"]}, {"page": "University of Central Lancashire", "response": ["*Lubaina Himid, Professor of Contemporary Art, 2017 Turner Prize winner"]}, {"page": "Pogus Caesar", "response": ["During the early 1980s Caesar became director of the West Midlands Minority Arts Service.
