United then made it two wins in a row on their travels as they defeated Leyton Orient 1\u20130 thanks to Nick Blackman's fifth goal of the campaign. During the match Mark Howard suffered a thigh injury in the 11th minute, being replaced in goal by George Long, and was later ruled out for up to 12 weeks. The following week, and despite attempts to retain his services, Paul Gallagher's loan period expired and he returned to his parent club. The Blades also announced changes to the Football Club board, with chairman Chris Steer stepping down to be replaced by Dave Green, and Nigerian financier Jacob Esan being added as a director. Despite George Long having made some impressive performances, Danny Wilson still looked to bring in another goalkeeper as cover and confirmed that former Wales international and free agent Danny Coyne had been invited to train with the Blades; but insisted that Long would continue to be first choice for the time being. The Blades then entertained Oldham Athletic at Bramall Lane, a bad tempered match which saw Oldham score in the seventh minute of injury time to snatch a 1\u20131 draw, and Lactics striker Lee Croft subsequently accused of racially abusing a ball boy. Having received a bye for the first round, United began their Football League Trophy campaign with a 4\u20131 victory over Notts County at Meadow Lane. Lecsinel Jean-Fran\u00e7ois played for the first time in over six months after a knee injury, appearing for the last 15 minutes as a substitute, however he injured his other knee and was ruled out for a further two months. Back in the league and a trip to Preston North End culminated in a 1\u20130 win thanks to a Dave Kitson goal, before a Nick Blackman penalty was enough to claim the same result in a home game against Walsall. With the month almost over the Blades beat the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsnenal by handing a three-year deal to 17-year-old Academy player Diego De Girolamo, before another Nick Blackman spot-kick was enough to despatch Portsmouth 1\u20130 at Bramall Lane.", "The opening of the January transfer window allowed Danny Wilson to strengthen his squad by signing experienced defender Danny Higginbotham on a free transfer from Stoke City on New Years Day, and both he and Elliott Whitehouse made their United d\u00e9buts for United that afternoon in the South Yorkshire derby against Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium where the Blades needed late goals from Blackman and Kitson to rescue a 2\u20132 draw. On 3 January Danny Wilson continued to revamp the squad by signing winger Jamie Murphy from Motherwell on a three and a half-year contract for an undisclosed fee, whilst John Cofie's loan deal was terminated and he returned to his parent club Manchester United, despite claiming that he wanted to see out the season with the Blades. Young forward Diego De Girolamo was called up to the Italy national under-18 squad ahead of the Blade's third round FA Cup tie at Oxford United. Murphy made his Blades debut against Oxford United as they booked their place in the fourth round, running out 3\u20130 winners thanks to goals from McMahon, Kitson and Blackman, earning United a trip to the Madejski Stadium against Premier League strugglers Reading. United continued to struggle with injuries as defender Matt Hill was ruled out for six weeks with a fractured cheek bone following the game at Oxford. United's transfer dealings continued with midfielder David McAllister leaving the Blades for former loan club Shrewsbury Town for an undisclosed fee, Alfreton Town decided to extend Matty Harriott's loan for a third month, and youth keeper George Willis signed his first professional contract with the Blades on a two and half-year deal. United's disappointing league form continued as they were beaten 2\u20130 at home by Yeovil Town, and allowed Notts County to score a late equaliser to draw 1\u20131 despite being reduced to ten men for much of the game. With the transfer window close to completion United allowed young striker Danny Philliskirk to leave after cancelling his contract. With the Blades game at Bury postponed due to weather conditions, their next match was the FA Cup fourth round tie at Reading, a match which saw United crash out of the competition following a 4\u20130 defeat. With a day of the transfer window remaining Reading agreed a deal to sign Nick Blackman, only six months after he had arrived at Bramall Lane, and after he had rejected a move to Crystal Palace.
