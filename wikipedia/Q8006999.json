William Collings Lukis MA. FSA (8 April 1817 in Guernsey \u2013 7 December 1892 in Wath, North Riding of Yorkshire) was a British antiquarian, archeologist and polymath.\n\nWilliam Collings Lukis was the third son of Frederick Corbin Lukis, the Colonel of Guernsey Militia. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was married to Lucy Adelaide, daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas Fellowes.Lukis is best remembered in England for his work on Church Bells which was published in 1857.  He was the first person to publish a collection of bell descriptions, chiefly from Wiltshire.  He was a founder member of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society and an authority on perspective drawing. It is his drawings of the Saxon church in Bradford on Avon, where he was curate from 1841 to 1846, that formed the basis for the illustrations for WH Jones's article on the Saxon Church in WAM V, and acknowledged by Jones in WAM XIII.\nLukis is also remembered for his work on the megaliths of Great Britain and France; with his university friend Sir Henry Dryden he surveyed the megalithic monuments of Brittany. He was ordained in Salisbury in 1845, and after holding several livings in Wiltshire he moved to Wath in Yorkshire, where he carried out a number of excavations. He published a treatise on ancient church plate in 1845 and was a regular contributor to the journals of the British Archaeological Association and other learned societies. His collection of artefacts was bought by the British Museum after his death.His sister Louisa was married to William Thomas Collings, Seigneur of Sark, and is the ancestor of the island's ruler until 2016, Michael Beaumont.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antiquarian", "response": ["*William Collings Lukis"]}, {"page": "William Thomas Collings", "response": ["Collings married his cousin Louisa, an amateur lichenologist and collector, on 15 June 1847.

Her parents were the Channel Islands naturalist, collector and antiquarian Frederick Lukis by his wife and first cousin Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Collings). Due to the early 19th-century views on female education, Collings and her sisters probably did not receive any formal schooling. Her interest in lichens was most likely due to the influence of her father, from whom she probably inherited many of the local specimens; her brother, William Collings Lukis, also shared their father's interests. Collings swapped her specimens with other collectors, including the family friend, Charles du Bois Larbalestier of Jersey, eventually amassing a collection of over 1,300 lichens held in a set of 32 folders and small box files. She also took time in 1862 to compile a list of 150 species of lichens that appear on the island of Guernsey, and presented it to the geologist David T. Ansted, who was working on a book about the Channel Islands.", "Louisa Lukis married her cousin, William Thomas Collings, on 15 June 1847.

She died there on 24 March 1887, having suffered from bronchitis for three days, shortly after her daughter. She had outlived all her children except for the Seigneur; her other daughters died respectively in 1851, 1859 and 1871.

It was excavated in 1858 by James Dyce Nicol, Charles Dalrymple, James Nicolson, Captain James Burnett, the Reverend Harry Stuart and Alexander Thomson. The cairn had already been plundered and they discovered some burnt bone fragments and pottery sherds. In the late nineteenth century the circle was visited by among others William Collings Lukis, Christian Maclagan, Robert Angus Smith, William Tomkin and Frederick Coles. Alexander Keiller noted in 1934 that there was an atypical number of stones and that their heights alternated. Alexander Thom surveyed the site in 1955 and Clive Ruggles checked for archaeoastrological alignments in 1981. A geological survey was carried out in 2006."]}]}}
