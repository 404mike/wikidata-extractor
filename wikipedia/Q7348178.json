Thomas Pride's infantry brigade of three infantry regiments was to the north west of the cavalry, ready to cross the Brox Burn further downstream at Broxmouth. George Monck, with a slightly smaller force than Pride, was south of the cavalry, in position to cross the Brox Burn upstream of the road ford at Brand's Mill. Behind all of these, held in reserve, was Cromwell's own Lord General's Regiment, reinforced by two companies of dragoons. A little upstream of Brand's Mill the English field artillery had set up on a prominent spur where it had a good field of fire into the centre of the Scottish army. To the south west of this concentration Robert Overton's three infantry regiments faced the three infantry brigades of the Scottish centre and left.

Canne was in favour with the soldiers as a preacher but he had a rival in John Shawe. Canne's friends obtained a grant for him from the council of state as his chaplain's salary. His stay in Hull was not long, but in 1653, when he published at London A Voice from the Temple to the Higher Powers, he denounced Shawe as 'a most corrupt man and hitherto countenanced by men as corrupt and rotten as himself.'

No charge was brought (as no charge was brought against Lyttelton) but he was imprisoned in the Tower and in September 1656 he petitioned Thurloe for his release. He was in a state of some poverty and, in March 1657, his debt to the warders was paid by the state. Thereafter, he was granted an allowance of 10 shillings per day for his subsistence. While in the Tower, Norwood was able to correspond with William Rumbold, who was one of Ormonde's and Chancellor Hyde's agents in London. At some point, Cromwell ordered him taken to Jersey, and he was imprisoned there until his release was authorised by Richard Cromwell in February 1659 (when Parliament ordered Robert Overton to be brought back from Jersey)..
