In spite of its relative remoteness, it had developed into a private club of noblemen and country gentry, for whom one of cricket's attractions was the opportunity it offered for betting. Although some of these occasionally played in matches, professional players were mainly employed.In 1782 it was decided that those who played for the County XI should receive \"on the practice days, four shillings if winners and three shillings if losers, provided they attended by twelve of the clock\".

Despite being ordained, a Steward of the Hambledon Club and a member of the Laws of Cricket committee, the Reverend Charles Powlett was not above gambling on the outcome of matches or of betting against his own team. At one point in the match against Surrey, the situation was such that a Surrey victory seemed certain. Powlett and his associate Philip Dehaney, another Hambledon member, decided to bet heavily on Surrey to win. Then Small was joined at the wicket by his captain Nyren and the two put on a massive century partnership which turned the game around, for Surrey collapsed and Hampshire won a famous victory. When Nyren was out, he was confronted by Powlett and Dehaney who complained that he and Small had cost them their money. Nyren, disgusted with them, retorted: \"Another time, don't bet your money against such men as we are.\"Underdown, p. 118.alt=Batsman hits out in front of the Bat & Ball public house|thumb|Batsman hits out in front of the Bat & Ball public houseBroadhalfpenny Down continued in regular use by Hambledon/Hampshire teams until 1781. At the end of that season, the Hambledon Club moved to Windmill Down, which is closer to the village. According to John Nyren, Windmill was \"one of the finest places for playing on I ever saw\".Underdown, p. 152. A key difference was that Windmill was under the club's control as they rented it from a farmer at ten guineas a year, whereas Broadhalfpenny was common land in use as sheep pasture, for fairs and other gatherings. It could be said that Broadhalfpenny belonged to the community and Windmill to the club, whose members may not have been happy about the \"raucous, boisterous crowds that gathered (on the Down)\". The move was done at the behest of the Duke of Dorset, chief among club members, and David Underdown saw it as the first step in a process which removed professional cricket from a truly rural setting and ultimately concentrated it in an urban environment, for it was Dorset's successors George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and Colonel Charles Lennox who were the key players in the establishment of the White Conduit Club in Islington and subsequently Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.Underdown, p. 153."]}, {"page": "Billy Beldham", "response": ["Although he was remembered primarily as a fine attacking batsman, Beldham was an all-rounder who took many wickets by operating as a change bowler.

The Hampshire teams promoted by the Hambledon Club were very competitive and so, evidently, were their opponents, among whom Yalden was a prominent member, sometimes as captain. Nyren describes Yalden as \"a thin, dark-looking man\" and as \"not a fine, but a very useful and steady batter\". Nyren revered Hambledon's Tom Sueter and Yalden was Sueter's rival as both a wicketkeeper and a batsman, although they played together for Hampshire in 1772. They are the first two players in cricket history to be recognised as \"wicketkeeper/batsmen\", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone. Nyren chose to denigrate Yalden in comparison with his hero Sueter saying that: \"I must place Sueter above Yalden\" (i.e., as a wicketkeeper) and that Yalden \"was in other respects an inferior man to Sueter\". Nyren says that Yalden's \"word was not always to be depended on when he had put a man out\" as \"he would now and then shuffle (sic) and \"resort to trick\". He goes on to assert that Sueter and the other Hambledon players would not do such things because of \"estimation\", \"honour\", \"trust\" and never questioning the decision of the umpire. Nyren's comments are seriously biased but some balance is provided by the editor's introduction to the modern version of the book when he states that \"Yalden \u2013 the England wicketkeeper and captain, no less \u2013 is dismissed in a few words\" while several other notable players are not mentioned at all.Nyren, p. 36 (editor's comments). Elsewhere the editor discusses Nyren's undoubted plagiarism of an earlier work by William Lambert and it is widely agreed that Nyren's account of Hambledon's players is hagiographic, often at the expense of their opponents, and Yalden is one player who was not given a fair hearing in this book.Nyren, p. 31 (editor's comments)."]}, {"page": "Lamborn (Hambledon cricketer)", "response": ["The pitched delivery was still new, having been introduced in the 1760s, when Lamborn played.
