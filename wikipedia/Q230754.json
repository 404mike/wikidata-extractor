The singer considered it to be a \"small development idea\", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases.

Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A&R department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to \"more mainstream producers and top-line writers\".
