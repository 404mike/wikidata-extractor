He began his career as an engraver, and executed a few plates, including a portrait of Joseph Richardson, M.P., after Martin Archer Shee. Concentrating then on miniature-painting, he became one of the most fashionable artists of his day, and for many years his only real rival was Sir William Ross. In 1831 he was appointed miniature-painter in ordinary to William IV and Queen Adelaide, and from 1837 to 1858 held the same post under Queen Victoria. He was knighted in 1837."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1796 British general election", "response": ["| Joseph Richardson"]}, {"page": "Joseph Richardson (1755-1803)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Richardson (1755\u20131803)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs in the first United Kingdom Parliament", "response": ["| Joseph Richardson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1802 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Joseph Richardson  \u2013 died  Replaced by Edward Morris 1803"]}]}}
