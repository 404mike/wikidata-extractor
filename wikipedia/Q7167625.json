In the 1900s, he had played Minor Counties cricket for Hertfordshire. He was born at Highbury, London and died at Upton Hellions, Crediton, Devon.\nEducated at the Merchant Taylors' School, Vasey became a schoolmaster at King's School, Bruton. Unusually to modern eyes, he was a successful member of the school hockey and cricket teams and a reproduction in 2008 of the 1908 edition of The Dolphin, the King's Bruton school magazine, shows a fair-haired mustachioed man as a member of both the unbeaten football team and as a gown-wearing teacher in the school photograph. Vasey returned to King's Bruton as a master after the First World War and was a housemaster.As a cricketer, Vasey was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler, though he did not bowl in either Minor Counties or first-class cricket. He played twice for Hertfordshire in 1906, making 31 in the innings victory over Oxfordshire. In minor cricket in 1911, he scored 282 for the Old Brutonians team against Sidmouth, sharing a second wicket partnership of 396 with Harold Hippisley, who made 150. His one first-class match came in 1913, and he made 10 and 3 in the match against Yorkshire at Bath, in which Hippisley also played. As late as 1931 he was playing for Old Brutonians in club matches.\nVasey served in the First World War with the Dorset Regiment; he was transferred from active service to the Ministry of National Service in 1917 with the rank of captain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Percy Vasey (1913) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "Vasey", "response": ["*Percy Vasey (1883\u20131952), English cricketer and schoolmaster"]}, {"page": "Harold Hippisley", "response": ["Hippisley was educated at King's School, Bruton where he was captain of cricket, hockey and football. As a cricketer, he was \"a forceful batsman, a cunning bowler and a fine fielder\". He joined his King's Bruton team-mate Leonard Sutton in the Somerset side late in the 1909 season and in his first match, playing against Worcestershire and batting at No 9, he made an unbeaten 40, which proved to be his highest first-class score. He played in all just seven times for Somerset and had only one other successful match: against Northamptonshire in 1913 he made 14 and 36, though Somerset lost the game heavily. He did not bowl in first-class cricket. In minor cricket, he scored 150 for the Old Brutonians team against Sidmouth in 1911, sharing a second wicket partnership of 396 with Percy Vasey, who made 282."]}]}}
