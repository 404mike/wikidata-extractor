The Shield is based on a challenge system, rather than a league or knockout competition as with most football trophies. The holding union must defend the shield in challenge matches, and a successful challenger becomes the new holder of the Shield. It was first awarded to Auckland, which had the best results in the 1903 season. In the first challenge on 6 August 1904, Wellington defeated Auckland 6\u20133 to lift what has become known colloquially as the Log o\u2019 Wood."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Uchter Knox, 5th Earl of Ranfurly (1856\u20131933), Governor of New Zealand (1897\u20131904)"]}]}}
