The car was not very successful, but it did give useful experience for the super touring era to come. For 1991, ARE picked up the works contract to run the Toyota team. The car was a success, challenging for the 1991 title. In 1992 Rouse was joined by Will Hoy, again running the Toyota Carina, before setting up the works Ford Mondeo team for 1993, hiring Paul Radisich to drive alongside himself. The Mondeo was the class of the field in the second half of the 1993 season,  but had to give best in 1994 to Alfa Romeo. He retired from driving at the end of 1994, hiring Kelvin Burt as Paul's teammate for 1995. That year was frustrating, and Ford gave the works contract to West Surrey Racing for the following season. Rouse instead ran a semi-works Nissan team in 1996, running Gary Ayles and Owen McAuley with limited success. Rouse later built a Super Touring specification Toyota Corolla which failed to find a racing team.http://www.btcccrazy.co.uk/btcc/btcc-greats-andy-rouse/"]}, {"page": "1992 World Sportscar Championship", "response": ["|  Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "1991 World Sportscar Championship", "response": ["|  Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "1989 World Sportscar Championship", "response": ["|  Chris Hodgetts", "|align=left|  Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "1988 World Sportscar Championship", "response": ["|  Chris Hodgetts", "|  Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "1987 World Sportscar Championship", "response": ["|  Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "Ferm\u00edn V\u00e9lez", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Tim Harvey Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "1995 BPR Global GT Series", "response": ["|  Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "British GT Championship", "response": ["|  Chris Hodgetts"]}, {"page": "BRDC Sportscar Championship", "response": ["Although only seven cars would attend the opening race at Silverstone Circuit, the series was able to expand to sixteen competitors by the end of its first year.
