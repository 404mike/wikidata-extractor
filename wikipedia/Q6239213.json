He is noted for his prolific scoring for Middlesbrough between 1966 and 1976.\nHickton was born in Brimington, near Chesterfield in Derbyshire. He started his career at Sheffield Wednesday, and made his debut in the Football League First Division on 7 March 1964 in a 2\u20132 draw away to Aston Villa. He went on to score 21 goals from 56 appearances, which caught the eye of Middlesbrough manager Stan Anderson, who took Hickton to Teesside in 1966.\nHickton was a goalscoring legend at Middlesbrough where he scored 192 goals in 10 years at the club, making nearly 500 appearances. As of 2009, he ranked fourth in the club's all-time goalscorers list and third in terms of appearances, behind George Camsell, George Elliott and Brian Clough, and Tim Williamson and Gordon Jones respectively.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Charlton took advice from Celtic manager Jock Stein, who allowed him to sign right-sided midfielder Bobby Murdoch on a free transfer. Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a championship winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton had to work with some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["* John Hickton", "* John Hickton (499)", "* John Hickton (193)"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 in English football", "response": ["*John Hickton (Middlesbrough) \u2013 25 goals"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 in English football", "response": ["*John Hickton (Middlesbrough) \u2013 24 goals"]}, {"page": "1967\u201368 in English football", "response": ["*John Hickton (Middlesbrough) \u2013 24 goals"]}]}}
