If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned. Delaying the process further was Chaplin's rigorous perfectionism. According to his friend Ivor Montagu, \"nothing but perfection would be right\" for the filmmaker. Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished. The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in The Kid. For The Immigrant, a 20-minute short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of filmenough for a feature-length."]}, {"page": "Sergei Eisenstein", "response": ["*1929 \u0428\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043c \u041b\u044f \u0421\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430 (The Storming of La Sarraz, with Ivor Montagu and Hans Richter, lost)"]}, {"page": "Charles Laughton", "response": ["Laughton commenced his film career in Great Britain while still acting on the London stage.

In the 1920s, film societies began advocating the notion that films could be divided into \"entertainment cinema directed towards a mass audience and a serious art cinema aimed at an intellectual audience\".
