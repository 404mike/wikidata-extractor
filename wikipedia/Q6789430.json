Tim Martin thought that the plot lacked direction at times. Although he conceded that the novel's main Henry/Bigend storyline felt lightweight, Matt Thorne writing in The Independent conjectured that it was part of Gibson's conscious design that that thread \"plays out against a backdrop of hidden machinations that have a much darker, wider resonance\". Thorne declared Spook Country a more substantial novel than its predecessor on this basis. John Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald concurred, writing that despite the similarity in the plots of the novels, the narrative foundation of the later novel was firmer, its structure \"more sophisticated\" and its \"seams less visible\".", "Ed Park singled out the author's prose for praise, proclaiming that \"[s]entence for sentence, few authors equal Gibson's gift for the terse yet poetic description, the quotable simile \u2013 people and products are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating the platonic ideal of the catalog\". Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, \"there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing\". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that \"the real news, in Spook Country, is that much of the flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to fit perfectly, now, on all kinds of things.\" In The Seattle Times, Nisi Shawl gushed that \"[e]ven without the high cool quotient of the novel's contents, the pleasure of Gibson's prose would be enough inducement for most of us to immerse ourselves in this book....\" Simon Cooper of The Book Show agreed with the commendations of Gibson's prose, but felt the plot and characterization let the book down:", "In a review for The Providence Journal, Andy Smith remarked that the author was \"a master of atmosphere, if not character\" \u2013 a sentiment echoed by The Post and Couriers Dan Conover, who, although praising the novel's intelligence and contemporary relevance, felt that Gibson's underlying political pre-occupation and detached narration came at the expense of character development. Neil Drumming, of Entertainment Weekly, in awarding the novel a \"B\" rating concurred, complaining that the protagonists \"often just feel like higher-tech automatons with useful features\" whose actions are the product of manipulation by \"external forces and cagey operatives\" rather than conscious decisions. In The Daily Telegraph, Roger Perkins was more blunt, remarking that the \"relentless pace and breathless dislocation\" of the plot hid \"character development that's as deep as dental veneer but equally shiny\". Matt Thorne summed up the issue in opining that \"The problem with a thriller which begins with a technology journalist talking to an experimental artist is that, no matter how exciting the events later become, it's hard to care.\"", "Reviewers were divided as to the merits of the novel's ending. Andy Smith lamented that the finale of the \"mostly intriguing\" novel was \"distinctly anticlimactic\". Tim Martin wrote that it seemed \"somehow less than the sum of its parts\". Clay Evans dismissed it as \"not especially meaningful, but fun\", whereas Matt Thorne found it lacking \"a traditional thriller's excitement\". San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Michael Berry called it \"an ingenious reversal\" which proved that despite its apparent cynicism, the novel was \"oddly optimistic for a ghost story\". Overall, Thorne judged the novel ultimately unsatisfactory on account of the underwhelming ending and because Gibson \"hides the full complications of the plot so successfully that it feels as if everything important is happening offstage\". Roger Perkins judged the novel to be \"a triumph of style over substance \u2013 which is exactly the way you suspect that Gibson wants it.\" His colleague Martin mused that along with the regular Gibsonian tropes, there was \"something new ... a dark and very contemporary surge of suspicion and bad faith\" in the novel which suggested that the author might be approaching the apex of his writing. Dan Conover concluded that while the \"darkly comic satire\" was \"a worthy addition to the Gibson canon and a significant cultural artifact\", it would not rank among the author's best works."]}, {"page": "Omega Minor", "response": ["Matt Thorne reviewed the book for The Independent: \"Among authors of big novels that address science, technology and psychology, Verhaeghen is closer to William T Vollmann, Don DeLillo and the underrated British author James Flint than Thomas Pynchon or David Foster Wallace. He has almost no interest in popular culture and his conspiracy theories tend to focus on historical injustice rather than sinister cabals. Although it is always entertaining, and rarely heavy going, there is nothing whimsical about this book.\" Thorne continued: \"Omega Minor is undoubtedly a curate's egg, but few recent novels rival its richness. And there is something admirable about an author who challenges not just the structural limitations of the novel, but also the limitations of our understanding of the universe. For all its flaws, this is an uncommonly intellectually stretching -- and satisfying -- experience.\""]}, {"page": "8 Minutes Idle", "response": ["8 Minutes Idle is an independent British film released in 2014 based on the book Eight Minutes Idle by Matt Thorne.
