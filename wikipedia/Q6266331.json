His musical career started with two acts working simultaneously, releasing music on London-based label, Wall of Sound.

Initially choosing the name as a reference to the explosion in demand for French house in the United Kingdom during the 1990s, Price even went as far as to conduct interviews with British journalists in French via an interpreter.
