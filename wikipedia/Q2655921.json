The procedure for dealing with human remains in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and Vladimirov's urn was carried to his grave in an ordinary coffin. Between 1925 and the opening of the Donskoye Cemetery crematorium in October 1927, interments in the wall and burials in the ground coexisted together; the former was preferred for foreign dignitaries of the Comintern (Jen\u0151 Landler, Bill Haywood,Half of Haywood's ashes is buried in Moscow, another in Chicago \u2013 Brooke, p. 43 Arthur MacManus, Charles Ruthenberg) while the latter was granted only to top Party executives (Mikhail Frunze, Felix Dzerzhinsky, Nariman Narimanov and Pyotr Voykov). Initially, the bodies of the deceased were laid in state in the Kremlin's halls, but with tightening of security in the late 1920s the official farewell station was relocated to the House of the Unions' \"Pillar Hall\" on Okhotny Ryad (where Lenin lay in state in 1924) and remained there until the end of the Soviet state. Burials initially took place to the north from the Senate tower, switching to the south side in 1934 and returning to the north side in 1977 (with a few exceptions). Interments in the wall were strictly individual; spouses and children of those interred in the wall had to be buried elsewhere. There were only three instances of group burials: the three-man crew of the Osoaviakhim-1 high-altitude balloon in 1934, the crew of a MiG-15UTI crash in 1968 (Gagarin and Seryogin), and the three-man crew of the Soyuz 11 spacecraft in 1971. In total, the wall accommodates the graves of 107 men and 8 women. No remains interred in the wall were ever removed from it, including the deceased who were posthumously accused of \"fascist conspiracy\" (Sergei Kamenev) or political repressions (Andrey Vyshinsky).", "| 1927||2||Arthur MacManus, Charles Ruthenberg"]}, {"page": "William Beardmore and Company", "response": ["*Arthur MacManus and David Kirkwood, notable Scottish socialists and trade unionists active in the Beardmore workforce."]}, {"page": "Campbell Case", "response": ["The new round of prosecutions embroiled not only Campbell but also eleven other members of the Communist Party, including Willie Gallacher, Wal Hannington, Albert Inkpin, Harry Pollitt, William Rust, R.
