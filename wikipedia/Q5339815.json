Born in England, in Nottingham, he moved to the United States at four, settling in Hartford, Connecticut and studying violin with his father; he later studied music in Berlin. There he studied the Joachim bowing technique.  As a composer he wrote mainly orchestral music, as well as many pieces for his instrument, including a concerto; he also wrote three string quartets.  He died in Melrose, Massachusetts. His most famous work is his \"Polish Dance\" for violin and piano, composed in 1918.\nEdmund Severn's work is often reflective of folk, nationalist and neoclassical genres of music. Severn continued composing into the mid-20th century until he died in 1942.\nSevern's pupils included the composer Frances Terry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Severn (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Edmund Severn (1862\u20131942), American violinist and composer"]}, {"page": "Emanuel Wirth", "response": ["Wirth was born in \u017dlutice (German: Luditz) in western Bohemia.

She was active as a piano instructor in New York City and Passaic, New Jersey, later moving to Northampton, Massachusetts. Much of her output consists of works for piano, but she composed a violin sonata and a theme and variations for string quartet as well; the sonata received a prize from the Society for the Publication of American Music in 1931. Stylistically, her work has been described as \"Mildly 20th-century with strong expressive qualities and rich harmonies\"."]}]}}
