Born in England, in Nottingham, he moved to the United States at four, settling in Hartford, Connecticut and studying violin with his father; he later studied music in Berlin. There he studied the Joachim bowing technique.  As a composer he wrote mainly orchestral music, as well as many pieces for his instrument, including a concerto; he also wrote three string quartets.  He died in Melrose, Massachusetts. His most famous work is his \"Polish Dance\" for violin and piano, composed in 1918.\nEdmund Severn's work is often reflective of folk, nationalist and neoclassical genres of music.
