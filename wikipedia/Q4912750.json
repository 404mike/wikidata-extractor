He represented the Barbarians and played county rugby for Surrey and the London Counties. Hullin was capped only once for Wales, being unfortunate to be playing at the same time as Gareth Edwards, one of the greatest scrum-halves in world rugby. Despite his lack of international caps, he was a regular first team club player, and toured overseas, with Cardiff, London Welsh and the Barbarians. He was also a successful Sevens player, finishing in the winning team in both the Snelling Sevens and the Middlesex Sevens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barry John", "response": ["Despite the Wales loss against Australia, the selectors kept faith with John, and he retained his place for the next Wales international. Played away from home, the opener of the 1967 Five Nations Championship against Scotland had him paired at half-back with Cardiff's Billy Hullin. John played badly while carrying a leg injury, and the very next match he was dropped, replaced by the more experienced Watkins.", "| Billy Hullin"]}, {"page": "Mumbles RFC", "response": ["* Billy Hullin (1 cap, while at Cardiff)"]}, {"page": "1942 in Wales", "response": ["*2 January \u2013 Billy Hullin, Wales international rugby union player (died 2012)"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Billy Hullin, 70, rugby union player."]}, {"page": "2012 in Wales", "response": ["*3 October \u2013 Billy Hullin, Welsh rugby player, 70"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2012", "response": ["*Billy Hullin, 70, Welsh rugby union player."]}, {"page": "1967 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Billy Hullin"]}]}}
