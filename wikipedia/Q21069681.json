All four candidates had contested Barossa at the 1933 election. The by-election was held, as with the 1933 election, in the aftermath of the 1932 Labor split, in which the state Labor Party had split into three separate and competing parties. Edwards had been an incumbent at the time of the split, and had followed the Cabinet into the separate Parliamentary Labor Party when they were expelled over their response to the Great Depression, before his defeat by Basedow in 1933. A rumoured candidate from the third Labor splinter, the Lang Labor Party, did not emerge."]}]}}
