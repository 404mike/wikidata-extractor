He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they are showing signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer-generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by AARON as programmed by Harold Cohen which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from The Age of Intelligent Machines and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally he predicts a new Luddite movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although he predicts a net gain of new and better jobs."]}, {"page": "Encinitas, California", "response": ["*Harold Cohen, Pioneer of Computer-Generated Art"]}, {"page": "Abstract impressionism", "response": ["*Harold Cohen (artist)", "* Harold Cohen", "* Harold Cohen: Before the Event"]}, {"page": "Generative art", "response": ["Fran\u00e7ois Morellet has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.
