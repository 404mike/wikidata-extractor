He spent most of his career with Southampton in the Football League First Division, and also for the Welsh national team.\nBorn in Holywell, Flintshire, Wales, he went to the same school as the Spurs defender Mike England, whom he played alongside in internationals for Wales. He was known as a header of the ball and was the top goal scorer in Division 1 for two seasons (1966\u20131968). In his first season at Southampton, he scored 12 goals in 10 consecutive league games.His younger brother Paul was an Arsenal youth player who went on to play for Charlton Athletic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 24", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Ron Davies, Welsh footballer (b. 1942)"]}, {"page": "Southampton F.C.", "response": ["For the following campaign Ron Davies arrived to score 43 goals in his first season.

Facing United in the European Cup Final at Wembley were Benfica; whilst his teammates rested, Best found \"a novel way to relax\" before the big game by sleeping with \"a particular young lady called Sue\". The game went into extra-time, and just three minutes into extra-time Best went on a mazy run and beat goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Henrique with a dummy, before rolling the ball into the net; two further goals from Brian Kidd and Bobby Charlton settled the tie at 4\u20131. The victory was not only the pinnacle of Best's career, but arguably Manchester United's greatest achievement, considering the Munich air disaster had wiped out most of the Busby Babes just ten years previously. Best also won the Ballon d'Or in 1968 after receiving more votes than Bobby Charlton, Dragan D\u017eaji\u0107 and Franz Beckenbauer. This meant that he had won the three major honours in club football at the age of just 22 (the league title, European Cup, and European Player of the Year award).
