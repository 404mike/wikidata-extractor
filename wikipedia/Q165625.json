Later in 2000, Levine was replaced by twins Brianne and Morgan Mullan. Kathryn Newton appeared in the role from 2002 to 2004. Abby Wathen also appeared as a teenage Colby in a dream sequence in 2002. In May 2006, it was reported that Ambyr Childers had been cast in the role of a teenage Colby. Childers first appeared on July 3, 2006. Childers revealed that she auditioned for the role about month before her high school graduation. At time, she was taking finals, so she flew out to New York City for a screen test. She returned home for her graduation and them came returned to New York for several fittings and eventually started work. In the spring of 2008, rumors began to circulate that Childers the role of Colby was about to recast. An audition script for the role of \"Edie\" fed into the rumors. However, a spokesperson initially denied that Childers was departing from the series. In April 2008 it was officially announced that Childers had been released from her contract. Though Childers claimed that she had chosen to leave, other sources hinted that Childers was forced out. Childers made her last appearance on May 6, 2008, and was replaced by Brianne Moncrief on May 7. With the decision to move production of All My Children, several actors chose not to relocate to California. Though initial reports said that all contract cast members were offered a chance to relocate, another source said that ABC had misled the actors. Apparently Moncrief was one of the actors who never got the offer to go to California and she was fired from the role. Just days later, ABC announced that Natalie Hall had been cast in the role of Colby. Meanwhile, Moncrief made her last appearance on November 12, 2009 and Hall made her debut on November 25, 2009. Hall filmed her first scenes in mid October just before the show relocated to Los Angeles. Hall made her last appearance in the final network broadcast of All My Children on September 23, 2011. In April 2013, The Online Network launched a Tumblr page and posted a picture of a call sheet. Viewers could vaguely make out the name Brooke Newton in the role of Colby Chandler, but nothing was confirmed. Newton even attended the series premiere in late April and was photographed with Ryan Bittle who had recast the role of Colby's big brother JR Chandler. On May 6, the network officially confirmed through a mass press release that Newton had been cast in the role of Colby. Newton's first airdate was June 5, 2013."]}, {"page": "List of American film actresses", "response": ["*Kathryn Newton born "]}, {"page": "List of All My Children cast members", "response": ["| Kathryn Newton"]}, {"page": "Newton (surname)", "response": ["* Kathryn Newton (born 1997), American actress"]}, {"page": "Gary Unmarried", "response": ["*Louise Brooks (Laura Marano in the pilot; Kathryn Newton from episode 2 onward): Gary and Allison's sassy daughter; a straight-A student and precocious environmentalist.", "*2010 - Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) Supporting Young Actress-Kathryn Newton-Won"]}]}}
