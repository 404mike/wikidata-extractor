He played for six clubs in a seventeen-year professional career.\nIn the years before, during and after World War II, Blackpool were one of the most powerful teams in England, and the trio of George Farrow, Eric Hayward and Harry Johnston became legendary. Farrow's main assets were accurate long-range passes, penalty taking, strong tackling, and a fierce strike of the ball. He was also one of the earliest exponents of the long throw-in.\nBorn in Whitburn, South Tyneside, Farrow joined Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic from  Wolves in July 1933. Farrow impressed in the struggling third division side. In the 1934/35 season, Farrow was the club's top scorer with 11 league goals and 2 goals in the F.A cup. While at Bournemouth, he was the club's penalty taker.  \nFarrow moved north from Bournemouth in 1936, for a \u00a31,250 fee, and made his debut for the Seasiders in September of that year, in a home win over West Ham United. He went on to make a further 32 league appearances in the 1936\u201337 campaign, scoring five goals. Initially an inside-left, he soon moved to wing-half, where his tackling was of more use. At the end of the season, Blackpool won promotion to Division One for only the second time in their existence. A nine-game win streak between 21 November and 1 January assisted the achievement.\nIn 1937\u201338, Farrow made thirty league appearances and scored another five goals, and the following season appeared in all but four of the club's league games. His only goal of the season was a penalty, Blackpool's second goal in a 2\u20131 victory at Sunderland on 17 September.\nWartime football intervened between August 1939 and May 1945, and when League football resumed in 1945\u201346, Farrow continued where he had left off, making 28 league appearances and scoring six goals.\nFarrow missed the first eleven games of the 1946\u201347 campaign, but he went on to appear in 28 of the remaining 31. His one-goal came in his first appearance of the season, a 3\u20131 victory over Manchester United at Bloomfield Road on 19 October.\n1947\u201348 proved to be Farrow's final season at the seaside. He made sixteen league appearances, scoring three goals, before being transferred to Sheffield United in the new year of 1948. He missed out on Blackpool's FA Cup run, which saw them reach that year's final, only to lose out to Manchester United at Wembley. His final appearance for Blackpool occurred on 3 January, a 5\u20130 home victory over Everton.\nHe finished his career with Bacup Borough and Whitburn St. Mary's.\nFarrow died in 1980, and was survived by his wife and two children \u2013 a daughter, Julie, and a son, Tony.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Farrow (surname)", "response": ["*George Farrow (1913\u20131980), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Whitburn, Tyne and Wear", "response": ["* George Farrow \u2013 footballer, member of Blackpool's 1953 FA Cup-winning side."]}, {"page": "Frank Soo", "response": ["Soo was quick and intelligent, and was noted for his ability to deliver perfectly placed passes.
