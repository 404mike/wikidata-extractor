(1938\u20131940)", "response": ["For the 1939\u201340 season Cork City managed to recruit two former Cork F.C. players, Owen Madden and Billy Millar, as well as two emerging players, Jackie O'Driscoll and Billy O'Neill. However it later emerged that Billy Millar had signed for Cork City while he was still technically contracted to Shelbourne and the club were subsequently fined by the Football Association of Ireland. Like Cork F.C. a few seasons earlier, Cork City began to struggle to raise travel costs for away games in Dublin and the fine received over Millar did not help. Then on 21 January, Cork City played Shelbourne and were unable to pay the visitors their 20% share of the gate money. On Sunday, 28 January 1940 at The Mardyke, Cork City played what transpired to be the last match in its short history. City defeated Bohemians 2\u20131 with O\u2019Neill scoring both goals. Under threat of suspension from the league, Cork City were dissolved on 13 February 1940. However history repeated itself and a new club, Cork United, was immediately formed and they were given permission to complete Cork City's league fixtures.   www.corkpastandpresent.ie  League of Ireland, Rsssf", "*  Billy Millar Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats"]}]}}
