His factory team career in the World Rally Championship lasted from 1993 to 2002. He won 21 rallies with more than one driver.\nGrist's first WRC win was in the Rally Argentina in 1993 with Juha Kankkunen, who at that time was a three times WRC champion. Grist and Kankkunen went on to win the 1993 WRC championship with Toyota. Grist stayed as Kankkunen's co-driver until 1997 when he joined Colin McRae with the 555 Subaru World Rally Team.\nGrist remained Colin McRae's co-driver until the  Rally New Zealand 2002, during which time the pair won 17 rallies, 27 podium finishes and gained overall 183 WRC points. Between 2002 and 2006, Grist and McRae also competed together in a number of one-off rallies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Nicky Grist (born 1961), rally co-driver"]}, {"page": "Monte Carlo Rally", "response": ["|  Juha Kankkunen   Nicky Grist ||  Toyota Castrol Team   Toyota Celica Turbo 4WD", "|  Juha Kankkunen   Nicky Grist ||  Toyota Team Europe   Toyota Celica GT-Four ST205", "|  Colin McRae   Nicky Grist ||  555 Subaru World Rally Team   Subaru Impreza WRC 98", "|  Colin McRae   Nicky Grist ||  Ford Motor Company   Ford Focus WRC"]}, {"page": "Wales Rally GB", "response": ["|  Juha Kankkunen Nicky Grist", "|  Colin McRae Nicky Grist"]}, {"page": "Ebbw Vale", "response": ["*Nicky Grist, rally co-driver"]}, {"page": "Juha Kankkunen", "response": ["After Lancia withdrew from the WRC after the 1992 season, Kankkunen rejoined Toyota to drive the Toyota Celica GT-Four ST185 with which Sainz had defeated him last year. Despite having to fare from mid-season with two substitute co-drivers after Juha Piironen suffered a brain hemorrhage, Kankkunen went on to take a record fourth drivers' title by winning five of his ten WRC events; the Safari Rally with Piironen, the Rally Argentina, the Rally Australia and the RAC Rally with his new co-driver Nicky Grist, and the 1000 Lakes Rally with Denis Giraudet due to Grist's pre-arrangement with Armin Schwarz. Kankkunen's win at the RAC marked his career 20th in the series, breaking compatriot Markku Al\u00e9n's record for most wins. Kankkunen and his third-placed teammate Didier Auriol brought Toyota the manufacturers' crown, the first for a Japanese manufacturer. He also became only the second motorsportsman to be voted the Finnish Sportsman of the Year, after the 1982 F1 world champion Keke Rosberg.", "In 1995, with two more rallies to go, Kankkunen's consistent performances during the season had kept him in the lead of the championship seven points ahead of Subaru's Colin McRae. At the penultimate round, the Rally Catalunya, he was leading by almost a minute over Sainz and McRae and seemed to be heading towards his first WRC victory on tarmac, as well as closing in on his fifth title. However, a pacenote mistake by either him or his co-driver Grist resulted in a crash and a retirement. After the event, Toyota were found guilty of the implementation of illegal turbo restrictor bypasses on their ST205 cars. The team was given a 12-month ban by the FIA. Toyota drivers Kankkunen, Auriol and Armin Schwarz were also stripped of all points in the championships. FIA president Max Mosley stated that \"there is no suggestion the drivers were aware of what was going on.\" In the following year (1996 which also happened to be the end of Nicky Grist's pairing with Kankkunen as a favor to replace Colin McRae's co-driver Derek Ringer from 1997 to 2002), Kankkunen competed for private Toyota teams in three events and finished fourth in Sweden, third in Indonesia and second in Finland.", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist"]}, {"page": "Safari Rally", "response": ["||  Nicky Grist", "||  Nicky Grist", "||  Nicky Grist"]}, {"page": "Rally Sweden", "response": ["|  Colin McRae Nicky Grist ||  Ford Motor Company Ford Focus RS WRC 00"]}, {"page": "Nicky", "response": ["* Nicky Grist (born 1961), Welsh former rally co-driver"]}, {"page": "Colin McRae", "response": ["| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist", "| Nicky Grist"]}, {"page": "Ralph Sheheen", "response": ["Until 2005, Sheheen was the host/narrator of Speed's coverage of the World Rally Championship, and of the network's magazine show, WRC Rally Magazine.
