Between the formation of the SAFA in 1909 and 1926, the SFA turned down requests from the SAFA, the FA and the FFF to stage international matches featuring a Scottish team made up of purely amateur players. One reason was that a Scottish amateur national team featuring no players from wholly amateur Scottish League First Division club Queen's Park would not be in the national interest, due to the prospective Scotland amateur matches clashing with Queen's Park's. In August 1926, the SAFA announced that the first Scotland amateur international match would take place against their English counterparts on 18 December that year at Filbert Street, with the team's selection being determined by the SFA. In front of a 10,000 crowd, Scotland won the match 4\u20131, courtesy of two goals from Laurie McBain and one each from George Jessiman and James Crawford."]}, {"page": "Glasgow Football Association", "response": ["|John Simpson (2), George Brown, James Crawford", "|James Crawford, Alex Venters"]}]}}
