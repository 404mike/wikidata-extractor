Vince Clarke, who established the latter group's electronic direction and later founded Yazoo and Erasure, cites OMD as his inspiration to become an electronic musician. OMD were an important act for Pet Shop Boys, whose singer, Neil Tennant, identified the band as \"pioneers of electronic music\". The group were revered by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Howard Jones, Alphaville, Book of Love and Ricky Wilde (songwriter/producer for Kim Wilde), and were also influential on New Order and Tears for Fears' exploration of electronic instruments. The band have garnered praise from other synth-pop peers including the Human League's Philip Oakey, Thompson Twins' Tom Bailey, Trevor Horn, and Gary Numan, who credited OMD for \"some of the best pop songs ever written\". Within the rock genre, the group influenced then-progressive band Spoons, and were championed by ZZ Top, who drew inspiration from OMD's use of synthesizers and onstage dancing."]}, {"page": "Wilde", "response": ["* Marty Wilde (born 1939), British rock and roll singer and actor; father of Kim and Ricky Wilde", "* Marty Wilde (born 1939), British rock and roll singer and actor; father of Kim and Ricky Wilde", "* Ricky Wilde (born 1961), British songwriter, musician, and record producer"]}, {"page": "List of show business families", "response": ["* Singer-songwriter Marty Wilde and singer/actress Joyce Baker are the parents of composer-performer-producer Ricky Wilde and singer-actress Kim Wilde."]}, {"page": "Jonathan King", "response": ["The label's first hit was \"Seaside Shuffle\" by Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs, followed by King's \"Loop di Love\", which reached number four, released under the pseudonym Shag.\"Shag\", 45cat.com.
