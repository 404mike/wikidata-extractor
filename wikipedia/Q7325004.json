He was a friend of the novelist Joseph Conrad, who was also the subject of several of his critical works. Conrad and Curle became friends in the 1910s, becoming especially close in Conrad's last years, and following Conrad's death in 1924 Curle was an executor of his estate. Curle's first book on Conrad, Joseph Conrad: A Study, was published in 1914; it was followed by Joseph Conrad's Last Day (privately published in 1924) and The Last Twelve Years of Joseph Conrad (1928), as well as a number of reviews and magazine articles. His other works included the travel book Into the East (1923), based on his experiences in Asia, the mystery novels Corruption (1933) and Who Goes Home? (1935), and Characters of Dostoevsky (1950), a study of the work of Fyodor Dostoevsky.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Conrad", "response": ["He wrote oftener about life at sea and in exotic parts than about life on British land because\u2014unlike, for example, his friend John Galsworthy, author of The Forsyte Saga\u2014he knew little about everyday domestic relations in Britain.  When Conrad's The Mirror of the Sea was published in 1906 to critical acclaim, he wrote to his French translator:  \"The critics have been vigorously swinging the censer to me.... Behind the concert of flattery, I can hear something like a whisper:  'Keep to the open sea!  Don't land!'  They want to banish me to the middle of the ocean.\"  Writing to his friend Richard Curle, Conrad remarked that \"the public mind fastens on externals\" such as his \"sea life\", oblivious to how authors transform their material \"from particular to general, and appeal to universal emotions by the temperamental handling of personal experience\".", "Conrad was keenly conscious of tragedy in the world and in his works. In 1898, at the start of his writing career, he had written to his Scottish writer-politician friend Cunninghame Graham: \"What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it. [A]s soon as you know of your slavery the pain, the anger, the strife\u2014the tragedy begins.\"  But in 1922, near the end of his life and career, when another Scottish friend, Richard Curle, sent Conrad proofs of two articles he had written about Conrad, the latter objected to being characterised as a gloomy and tragic writer. \"That reputation... has deprived me of innumerable readers... I absolutely object to being called a tragedian.\"", "Conrad claimed that he \"never kept a diary and never owned a notebook.\" John Galsworthy, who knew him well, described this as \"a statement which surprised no one who knew the resources of his memory and the brooding nature of his creative spirit.\" Nevertheless, after Conrad's death, Richard Curle published a heavily modified version of Conrad's diaries describing his experiences in the Congo;", "According to Conrad's close friend and literary assistant Richard Curle, the fact of Conrad writing in English was \"obviously misleading\" because Conrad \"is no more completely English in his art than he is in his nationality\".  Conrad, according to Curle, \"could never have written in any other language save the English language....for he would have been dumb in any other language but the English.\"", "* Last Essays, edited by Richard Curle, 1926"]}, {"page": "Melrose, Scottish Borders", "response": ["* Richard Curle, author, critic and journalist* "]}, {"page": "Lord Jim", "response": ["* Lord Jim, by Richard Curle, in Joseph Conrad: a study (1914)."]}, {"page": "William Wordsworth Fisher", "response": ["Fisher was the brother of Herbert Fisher, Edmund Fisher, Charles Fisher, Florence Henrietta Darwin and Adeline Vaughan Williams.

In the story, the parting seems very risky; in reality, the disaster took place near shore.  And the boats did not steer for Java, to the east of Sumatra, but toward the port of Muntok on Bangka Island, off the east coast of Sumatra.  Indeed, Richard Curle's 1922 identification of Muntok as the port where the story's hero experienced his first fascinating encounter with the exotic East revealed the story's greatest exaggeration: the boats could reach shore in some dozen hours, with no need to \"knock about in an open boat\" for \"nights and days\".  Conrad had also forgotten, after all those years, that he had three, not two, sailors with him in his boat.  But the most interesting discrepancy between story and reality consisted in Conrad's extolling the crew as \"Liverpool hard cases\", whereas in fact there was not a single Liverpudlian in the crew, and half were non-Britons."]}, {"page": "Edwin Fisher (banker)", "response": ["Fisher was the youngest son of the historian Herbert William Fisher and his wife  Mary Louisa Jackson (he had 10 older siblings).
