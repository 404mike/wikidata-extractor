Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections.\n\nOver the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat.\nIn 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery.\nIn April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election.
