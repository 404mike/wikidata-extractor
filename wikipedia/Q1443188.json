He was supervised by Armitage Robinson, the Dean of Westminster, who insisted that innovation be balanced by tradition. In fact, there was little change from the 1902 coronation, or at least that which had been intended, since the service had been shortened because of Edward's poor health. Randall Davidson, who as the Bishop of Winchester, had largely compiled the 1902 coronation service, was now Archbishop of Canterbury. Davidson sought the advice of Frank Edward Brightman, a liturgist from Magdalen College, Oxford. The main changes were to the words spoken at the actual crowning, which replaced those first used at the Coronation of James II with a translation of the simpler medieval form,Strong, p.480 and the coronation sermon, which had been omitted in 1902, was reintroduced for the last time, but in a shorter form.Strong, Roy, Coronation, p.477 The service was conducted by Davidson, including the crowning of the queen, which in 1902 had been delegated to the Archbishop of York.Strong, p.479"]}, {"page": "List of English translations from medieval sources: C", "response": ["* Coptic ostraca (1902).Crum, W.
