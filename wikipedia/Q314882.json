He is best known for directing three James Bond films, including the first two films in the series, Dr. No (1962) and From Russia with Love (1963), as well as Thunderball (1965). His other films include the Audrey Hepburn thrillers Wait Until Dark (1967) and Bloodline (1979), the historical drama Mayerling (1968), the infamous Korean War epic Inchon (1981), and the Charles Bronson films Cold Sweat (1970), Red Sun (1971), and The Valachi Papers (1972).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Bond", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Terence Young", "| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Terence Young"]}, {"page": "June 20", "response": ["*  1915   \u2013 Terence Young, Chinese-English director and screenwriter (d. 1994)"]}, {"page": "Joseph Conrad", "response": ["* The Rover (1967), adaptation of the novel The Rover (1923), directed by Terence Young, featuring Anthony Quinn"]}, {"page": "Liv Ullmann", "response": ["| Terence Young"]}, {"page": "Sean Connery", "response": ["In early 1957, Connery hired agent Richard Hatton who got him his first film role, as Spike, a minor gangster with a speech impediment in Montgomery Tully's No Road Back alongside Skip Homeier, Paul Carpenter, Patricia Dainton, and Norman Wooland. In April 1957, Rakoffafter being disappointed by Jack Palancedecided to give the young actor his first chance in a leading role, and cast Connery as Mountain McLintock in BBC Television's production of Requiem for a Heavyweight, which also starred Warren Mitchell and Jacqueline Hill. He then played a rogue lorry driver, Johnny Yates, in Cy Endfield's Hell Drivers (1957) alongside Stanley Baker, Herbert Lom, Peggy Cummins, and Patrick McGoohan. Later in 1957, Connery appeared in Terence Young's poorly received MGM action picture Action of the Tiger opposite Van Johnson, Martine Carol, Herbert Lom, and Gustavo Rojo; the film was shot on location in southern Spain. He also had a minor role in Gerald Thomas's thriller Time Lock (1957) as a welder, appearing alongside Robert Beatty, Lee Patterson, Betty McDowall, and Vincent Winter; this commenced filming on 1 December 1956 at Beaconsfield Studios.", "Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, who helped polish him while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that \"Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat\". The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week after Dr. No's opening, and he became a major sex symbol in film."]}, {"page": "September 7", "response": ["*  1994   \u2013 Terence Young, Chinese-English director and screenwriter (b. 1915)"]}, {"page": "Vittorio De Sica", "response": ["* The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders (1965, by Terence Young) as The Count"]}, {"page": "Eddie Chapman", "response": ["The 1966 film Triple Cross was based on the biography The Real Eddie Chapman StoryMacintyre (2007 revised 2010) p318 co-written by Chapman and Frank Owen.

Hepburn played the daughter of a famous art collector, whose collection consists entirely of forgeries which are about to be exposed as fakes. Her character plays the part of a dutiful daughter trying to help her father with the help of a man played by Peter O'Toole. The film was followed by two films in 1967. The first was Two for the Road, a non-linear and innovative British dramedy that traces the course of a couple's troubled marriage. Director Stanley Donen said that Hepburn was freer and happier than he had ever seen her, and he credited that to co-star Albert Finney.Behind Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer's Breakup, Screenland, December 1967 The second, Wait Until Dark, is a suspense thriller in which Hepburn demonstrated her acting range by playing the part of a terrorised blind woman. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. She lost fifteen pounds under the stress, but she found solace in co-star Richard Crenna and director Terence Young. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, \"Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes.\"", "After 1967, Hepburn chose to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally in the following decades. She attempted a comeback playing Maid Marian in the period piece Robin and Marian (1976) with Sean Connery co-starring as Robin Hood, which was moderately successful. Roger Ebert praised Hepburn's chemistry with Connery, writing, \"Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love. And they project as marvelously complex, fond, tender people; the passage of 20 years has given them grace and wisdom.\"Chicago Sun-Times review by Roger Ebert , 21 April 1976, Retrieved on 7 July 2008 Hepburn reunited with director Terence Young in the production of Bloodline (1979), sharing top-billing with Ben Gazzara, James Mason, and Romy Schneider.Canby, Vincent (June 29, 1979). \"Film: Audrey Hepburn in 'Bloodline'\".
