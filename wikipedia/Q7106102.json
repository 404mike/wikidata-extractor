Of his casting, Ogbourne stated: \"I am really excited to be playing the role of Nathan Wylde. He is a bit of a rogue and I'm looking forward to bringing out his darker side. He's definitely not as nice as he seems.\" Asked about if he has settled in Ogbourne said: \"It's been really cool. I'd heard amazing things about the cast and crew before I joined and it's cheesy to say it but it's entirely true - everyone's so warm and welcoming. It's very much been a case of me being thrown in at the deep end with long, all-consuming days.
