Ant later acted in Derek Jarman's seminal \"punk\" film Jubilee in 1977, as Adam and the Ants was beginning to gig around London with manager Jordan from the SEX Boutique on Kings Road. His debut as a recording artist was the song \"Deutscher Girls\", which featured on the film's soundtrack, along with \"Plastic Surgery\" which was performed in the film itself. \"Deutscher Girls\"/\"Plastic Surgery\" was re-released as a single in 1982. The band toured extensively around the UK but proved to be unpopular with much of the British music press who disliked their fetishistic lyrics and imagery.

Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.Kerrang! Issue #21; pp. 76\u201382 He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed. When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked. Therefore, he accentuates the melodically driven technique of players such as Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored. Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like Randy Rhoads and Steve Vai, but represses an urge to emulate their style: \"People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s.\" Believing that focusing only on \"clean tones\" is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a \"grimy\" sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to \"mistreat\" his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing. He also tries to break as many \"stylistic boundaries\" as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal and that many of his contemporaries \"follow the rules with no risk\"."]}, {"page": "Bow Wow Wow", "response": ["In 1980, former Sex Pistols manager McLaren persuaded David Barbarossa (also known as Dave Barbe), guitarist Matthew Ashman and bassist Leigh Gorman to leave Adam Ant and form a new group under McLaren's management.
