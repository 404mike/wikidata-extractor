He played for Partick Thistle for his whole senior career, making over 400 league appearances.After retiring as a player, he took over from Scott Symon as manager at Partick Thistle in 1970. McParland led Thistle to promotion to the top division in his first season as manager, and the following year guided them to arguably their greatest triumph, a 4\u20131 win in the 1971 Scottish League Cup Final against Celtic.  Following mid-table finishes in 1972-73 and 1973\u201374, McParland walked out on Thistle after a disagreement with the board.In June 1974 McParland left Partick Thistle to become head coach at lower league Queens Park.  This was the first time at Queens Park that team selection was handed over totally to the coach.  In his first season, Queens Park could only finish 16th in the old Scottish Second Division, well away from getting into the new First Division as the League structure was altered to three divisions.  The following year saw them finish fourth in the new Scottish Second Division (third tier), still short of winning promotion.McParland joined Celtic for the start of season 1976-77 as assistant manager, working under Jock Stein.  McParland took charge of the 'tracksuit' aspects of coaching at Celtic whilst Stein watched from the touchline, still not fully recovered from the serious car smash he was involved in the year before.  His first season saw Celtic win a league and cup double, however the club finished trophy-less the following season and slumped to a fifth place league finish.  He was released by the club at the end of that season.McParland then became manager of Hamilton Accies, where he spent four seasons before leaving in the autumn of 1982. He had spells as Head of Youth Development at Airdire,  Dunfermline and Motherwell.\nIn October 2001 McParland was appointed Director of Football at Dumbarton but was released from his role in May 2002 amidst rumours that he did not get on with manager Tom Carson.McParland died in July 2018, just days after Thistle had announced their new training ground would be named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Partick Thistle F.C.", "response": ["On 23 October 1971 Davie McParland's team secured the club's most famous result against Jock Stein's Celtic in the League Cup final at Hampden Park, Glasgow. 62,470 fans watched Thistle take a dramatic 4\u20130 lead at half time with goals from Alex Rae, Bobby Lawrie and Jimmy Bone amongst the many emerging talents in the Thistle squad including Alan Rough, Alex Forsyth and Denis McQuade. Kenny Dalglish pulled a goal back for Celtic, however the final result was never in doubt as Thistle eased to a 4\u20131 victory. Ironically before the match, former BBC sport broadcaster Sam Leitch stated that \"In Scotland, it's League Cup final day at Hampden Park, where Celtic meet Partick Thistle, who have no chance.\"", "On 7 May 2016, Thistle secured their Premiership status with a 2\u20130 away victory to Kilmarnock, with goals coming from Steven Lawless and Kris Doolan. This result meant that Archibald overtook former manager Davie McParland as the record holder of top-flight victories. On 8 April 2017, Thistle beat Motherwell 1\u20130 to secure a place in the top six for the first time since the league split was first introduced to the Scottish top flight in 2000\u201301.", "In July 2018, it was announced that the new training facility would be named after Thistle's 1971 Scottish League Cup Final manager Davie McParland, who died just days after the announcement was made. The new facility was to be located near the town Kirkintilloch. Plans for the new facility were abandoned in December 2019 as the investment money was instead used by Colin Weir to purchase the club and to operate a fan-owned business model. A short time after this announcement, Weir died at the age of 71.", "*  Davie McParland", "|Davie McParland", "|align=\"left\"|Davie McParland"]}, {"page": "Hamilton Academical F.C.", "response": ["*  Davie McParland, 1978\u20131982"]}, {"page": "Queen's Park F.C.", "response": ["The 1975\u201376 season saw the reconstruction of the Scottish Leagues and Queen's entered the Second Division (third tier). Coinciding with this, Queen's appointed a head coach for the first time. Davie McParland led Queen's to 4th place but left at the end of the season to join Partick Thistle. Joe Gilroy was his successor and Queen's finished 5th, 7th and 13th under his guidance before his departure at the end of 1978\u201379."]}, {"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["Stein was badly injured in a car crash in 1975; he nearly died but eventually recovered. For most of season 1975\u201376, Sean Fallon assumed control as manager. Stein returned to his position at the start of the 1976\u201377 season. Davie McParland joined Celtic at this time, replacing Sean Fallon as assistant manager and working under Stein. McParland took charge of the 'tracksuit' aspects of coaching at Celtic whilst Stein watched from the touchline, still not fully recovered from the serious car smash he was involved in the year before. Stein signed Hibernian's long-serving captain, defender Pat Stanton. Later on in the season, Stein signed attacking midfielder Alfie Conn from Tottenham Hotspur. It was a transfer that surprised many, given Conn had played for Rangers in the early 70s, winning the European Cup Winners' Cup for them in 1972 and scoring in a 3\u20132 win over Celtic in the 1973 Scottish Cup Final. Conn became the first footballer post-World War II to play for both Rangers and Celtic. Celtic, helped considerably by Stanton's organisation of the defence, went on to win their tenth league and cup double; Celtic finished nine points ahead of Rangers in the league and beat them 1\u20130 in the cup final courtesy of an Andy Lynch penalty."]}]}}
