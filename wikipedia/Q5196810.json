He lost to two lightweight ex-champions, Len Beynon in 1939 and Cuthbert Taylor in 1940, but he also took wins over George Pook, a future South-West featherweight champion and Warren Kendall who would become Welsh lightweight champion in 1948. Worgan made headlines in 1941 when he faced the World number two Ritchie \"Kid\" Tanner of British Guyana, beating him on points. In 1942 Worgan, now under the management of ex-fighter Billy \"Kid\" Hughes, faced his most notable adversary Nel Tarleton. Tarleton was the Commonwealth champion who in 1934 lost on points to Freddie Miller for the NBA title in 1934. The match was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March and was scheduled for eight rounds. The match went the distance with Worgan losing on a points decision. Despite being beaten Worgan later commented that 'Nel was one of the greatest in the game.' Worgan faced Tarleton on another two occasions, losing both on points decisions, in Liverpool in 1942 and Nottingham in 1943."]}, {"page": "Ronnie James", "response": ["After the Crowley contest, James began to face more challenging contests on a regular basis. James fought and lost against Spaniard Baltasar Sangchili, but then knocked out fellow Welshman Phineas John in the eighth round in October 1936. These bouts were followed with another points draw with Corbett. The end of 1936 through to 1937 saw James face a dearth of experienced challengers, before he met Cuthbert Taylor at St Helen's in Swansea. The match was won by James, which was followed by another victory, this time against Douglas Kestrell. The Kestrell fight was followed by a loss to Liverpool fighter Tony Butcher, who came off a twelve-match losing streak to stop James by a technical knockout in the sixth of a twelve-round bout in the Market Hall of Haverfordwest."]}, {"page": "Len Wickwar", "response": ["|align=left|Cuthbert Taylor", "|align=left|Cuthbert Taylor"]}, {"page": "Phineas John", "response": ["1929 started with a loss through disqualification to Billy Clarke, before recording seven straight wins, including a victories over Cuthbert Taylor and Bert Kirby, and a successful defence of his flyweight title to Merthyr fighter Jerry O'Neil. During this period, John and his brother Eddie, who was also fighting at flyweight, were classed as the highest ranked fighters in the Welsh Area and a fight for the title was considered between them. The Welsh Boxing Association wrote to the British Boxing Board of Control who decided the fight should not take place. His winning streak was stopped on 22 April 1929, when he faced Jackie Brown at the National Sporting Club. John lost on points to Brown, who later that year would become British flyweight champion. John faced further disappointment that year when he lost his Welsh flyweight title to Freddy Morgan on 22 July.", "John responded to his title loss by moving up a weight division to bantamweight. His first bout at his new weight saw him take the Welsh Area bantamweight title from Cuthbert Taylor in a contest on 2 September 1929 at Pontypridd. By 1930 John had moved up the weights again, settling at featherweight. He took on-board manager Ted Broadribb, and in 1931 John moved his family to London and centred his boxing career there.Lee (2009), p.136 His time fighting out of London was very successful winning 19 out of 25 fights, with only three losses. Of those three losses two were against Benny Sharkey. In April 1932, John travelled to South Africa, where he undertook three fights at City Hall in Johannesburg. He won all three bouts, including a points win over South African featherweight champion Willie Smith and future South African champion, Len McLoughlin. On his return to Great Britain, John fought another six times that year, with patchy results; winning three but losing against Ginger Jones, Seaman Tommy Watson and another defeat at the hands of Benny Sharkey.", "In 1934, John again travelled abroad to fight, this time to Australia. John was forced to retire from both his Australian fights, suffering a cut eye against Varias Milling, and then a tenth round retirement, again from an open cut above the eye, against Merv 'Darkie' Blandon. On his return from Australia, John's form suffered, finishing 1934 with losses to Johnny King, Dick Corbett and Cuthbert Taylor. His form didn't recover until 1938 when he lost only four of his seventeen bouts, which saw John defeat the likes of George Marsden and Tommy Hyams."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Cuthbert Taylor"]}, {"page": "England Boxing National Amateur Championships Flyweight Champions", "response": ["|1928 || Cuthbert Taylor  || (Cardiff Gabalfa AC)"]}]}}
