In 1978-1989 he played, extensively toured and recorded with ex-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett and his flautist brother, John Hackett.\nHe was a vital member of Steve Hackett's band, appearing, in total, on six Hackett studio albums released on Charisma Records and Lamborghini Records in 1979-1984. Magnus' contribution was especially considerable on the 1981 album Cured, which he co-produced, and on which he co-wrote (with Hackett) one song, \"Funny Feeling\", and also programmed the famous Linn LM-1 drum machine.\nNick Magnus studied piano from years 6-15, cathedral organ from 15-18, self-taught thereafter. He started his professional musical career in early 1976 with the symphonic rock band, The Enid. Then he spent two years with the progressive rock group Autumn. In 1987 he scored the music to the horror film Bloody New Year, which was directed by Norman J. Warren.\nHe has released six solo albums of his own compositions: Straight On Till Morning (1993), Inhaling Green (1999),\nHexameron (2004), Children of Another God (2010),  N'Monix (2014) and the latest Catharsis (2019). Steve Hackett played the guitar on the four latest albums.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Enid", "response": ["*Nick Magnus \u2013 keyboards (1974)", "*Nick Magnus - keyboards"]}, {"page": "Steve Hackett", "response": ["Having released two albums, Hackett was faced with the task of assembling a band to perform the material live. This became a group with John Hackett on flute, bass pedals, and guitar, Dik Cadbury on bass and vocals, Nick Magnus on keyboards, John Shearer on drums, and Pete Hicks on lead vocals. The subsequent European tour was Hackett's first as a solo performer. It began at the Chateau Neuf in Oslo, Norway on 4 October 1978 and ended with six shows across the UK, culminating at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 30 October. Hackett used his band on his next album, Spectral Mornings, recorded in the first two months of 1979 in the Netherlands. The album contains various musical styles, including straightforward and progressive rock, folk, and a wider range of instruments such as a Cantonese koto. It reached No. 22 in the UK and No. 138 in the US. The supporting tour included a spot at the Reading Festival in August 1979.
