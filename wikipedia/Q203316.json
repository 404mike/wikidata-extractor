Although violence may be explored in various other genres as well, death metal may elaborate on the details of extreme acts, including blood and gore, psychopathy, delirium, mutilation, mutation, dissection, exorcism, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris commented this apparent glamorisation of violence may be attributed to a \"fascination\" with the human body that all people share to some degree, a fascination that mixes desire and disgust. Heavy metal author Gavin Baddeley also stated there does seem to be a connection between \"how acquainted one is with their own mortality\" and \"how much they crave images of death and violence\" via the media.Baddeley, Gavin. Raising Hell!: The Book of Satan and Rock 'n' Roll Additionally, contributing artists to the genre often defend death metal as little more than an extreme form of art and entertainment, similar to horror films in the motion picture industry. This explanation has brought such musicians under fire from activists internationally, who claim that this is often lost on a large number of adolescents, who are left with the glamorisation of such violence without social context or awareness of why such imagery is stimulating."]}, {"page": "Temple of Set", "response": ["Aquino has stated that he believed LaVey not to be merely a charismatic leader but to have been actually appointed by Satan himself (referring to this charismatic authority as the \"Infernal Mandate\") to found the Church. After the split of 1975, Aquino believed LaVey had lost the mandate, which the \"Prince of Darkness\" then transferred to Aquino and a new organization, the Temple of Set. According to both the historian of religion Mattias Gardell and journalist Gavin Baddeley, Aquino displayed an \"obsession\" with LaVey after his departure from the Church, for instance by publicly releasing court documents that reflected negatively on his former mentor, among them restraining orders, divorce proceedings, and a bankruptcy filing. In turn, LaVey lampooned the new Temple as \"Laurel and Hardy's Sons of the Desert\". In 1975, the Temple incorporated as a non-profit Church in California, and later that years secured state and federal recognition and tax-exempted status."]}, {"page": "Cradle of Filth", "response": ["Cradle of Filth's particular genre has provoked a great deal of discussion, and their status as a black metal band or otherwise has been in debate since near the time that the group rose to fame. The band have cited acts that were heavily influential to black metal such as Bathory, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate among their influences, but Dani Filth, in a 1998 interview for BBC Radio 5 for example, said \"I use the term 'heavy metal', rather than 'black metal', because I think that's a bit of a fad now. Call it what you like: death metal, black metal, any kind of metal...\". Gavin Baddeley's 2006 Terrorizer interview states that \"few folk, the band included, call Cradle black metal these days.\" In a 2006 interview with Terrorizer, then-guitarist Paul Allender said, \"We were never a black metal band. The only thing that catered to that was the make-up. Even when The Principle of Evil Made Flesh came out\u2014you look at Emperor and Burzum and all that stuff\u2014we didn't sound anything like that.
