After preliminary graduate study at Newcastle University, he was appointed as an Excavations Director for English Heritage, continuing with graduate studies on a part-time basis to eventually be awarded his PhD in 1991. The title of his PhD thesis was The Setting, Development and Function of the Hadrianic Frontier in Britain. From 1985 to 1995, Bennett worked for a New York travel company, guiding for institutions such as the Smithsonian and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and working as Tour Leader and Archaeological Guide Lecturer on boat cruises around Europe and Scandinavia, the Mediterranean World, and South America. \nIn 1995 Bennett became a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara. His areas of expertise are: provincial and military Roman archeology, late Roman and Byzantine architecture in Turkey, the Roman Empire and the Roman army and the study of Late Antique and Medieval architecture. He has published numerous monographs and articles on various aspects of Roman and Medieval Britain and the Roman army, and is the author of two books, Towns in Roman Britain (1980) and Trajan. Optimus Princeps. A Life And Times (1997). The latter has been translated into Romanian and Russian.\nBennett's fieldwork experience extends from rural and urban salvage excavations in Britain, Romania, and Germany to his current research project, studying the architecture of the Moldavian and Ottoman castle of Belgorod-Akkerman, in the Ukraine. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 2002, becoming only the third person in Turkey to receive that distinction. Bennett has appeared in many TV documentaries for the BBC, The History Channel and National Geographic. \nJulian has one daughter, Laura I. H. Bennett (b. 1984) and two sons, Alexander Shah Whitham Bennett(b. 2006), Arthur Kaan Whitham Bennett(b. 2009).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trajan", "response": ["It was exactly this military character of Trajan's reign that attracted his early twentieth-century biographer, the Italian Fascist historian Roberto Paribeni, who in his 1927 two-volume biography Optimus Princeps described Trajan's reign as the acme of the Roman principate, which he saw as Italy's patrimony.A. G. G. Gibson, ed. Robert Graves and the Classical Tradition. Oxford University Press, 2015, , pp. 257/258 Following in Paribeni's footsteps, the German historian Alfred Heuss saw in Trajan \"the accomplished human embodiment of the imperial title\" (die ideale Verk\u00f6rperung des humanen Kaiserbegriffs). Trajan's first English-language biography by Julian Bennett is also a positive one in that it assumes that Trajan was an active policy-maker concerned with the management of the empire as a wholesomething his reviewer Lendon considers an anachronistic outlook that sees in the Roman emperor a kind of modern administrator.J.E.
