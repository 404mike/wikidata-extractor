Due to a self-admitted spendthrift attitude, Smith felt he had nothing to lose when a producer from NBC and Quincy Jones approached him with an idea for a sitcom, with Townes appearing as a recurring character, named \"Jazz\". A popular running gag would have Uncle Phil (James Avery) literally throwing Jazz out of the house; however, this action is not restricted to Uncle Phil, as other characters, including Hilary Banks (Karyn Parsons), Geoffrey Butler (Joseph Marcell), the second Aunt Vivian (Daphne Maxwell Reid) and even Will himself, have thrown him out in the same manner. Another trademark on the show involved Jazz and Will greeting each other by slapping each other's hand, then swinging back in opposite directions while saying \"Pssh!\" The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air boosted his profile and his pocketbook. But Smith ended up squandering almost US$2.8m, while failing to pay any of it to the Internal Revenue Service in income taxation. Soon after And in This Corner... was released, Smith was found guilty of income-tax evasion by the IRS, and sentenced to pay this all back.
