As in several towns and cities, there were discussions within the town as to whether its war memorial should serve a purely monumental purpose or some sort of community function. Suggestions included renovating civic buildings, a new 2,000-seat concert hall, and a classical-style arch on Guildhall road. The Northamptonshire War Memorial Committee, chaired by local landowner John Powys, 5th Baron Lilford, eventually commissioned Lutyens to design a purely commemorative monument, and selected a site in part of the churchyard of All Saints' Church. The memorial was funded by public donations, including a donation of \u00a350 from Lord Lilford.Boorman (1988), p. 122.Sawford, pp. 131\u2013133."]}, {"page": "Robert Vernon Atherton Gwillym", "response": ["* John Powys, 5th Baron Lilford"]}, {"page": "79 Mount Street", "response": ["In the 1930s, it was home to John Powys, 5th Baron Lilford."]}, {"page": "Richard Atherton", "response": ["* John Powys, 5th Baron Lilford"]}, {"page": "George William Culme Soltau Symons", "response": ["In 1854  Soltau Symons married the Hon.
