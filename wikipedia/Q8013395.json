He served as Regius Professor of Greek from 1783 to 1811.\nHe was a popular, convivial and hospitable man with something of a reputation for hard drinking. Spencer Perceval, the Prime Minister, questioned his suitability on that ground; but the Prince Regent, who was a friend of Jackson's replied that he could see no objection to a Bishop eating well and drinking port.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clerk of the Closet", "response": ["* William Jackson, Bishop of Oxford by 1813\u20131815"]}, {"page": "Regius Professor of Greek (Oxford)", "response": ["* William Jackson, 1783\u20131811"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Oxford", "response": ["| 60px William Jackson"]}]}}
