Ritchie would not enjoy the benefits of his decision though, as he was replaced by Joe Baker early in the season, and Baker went to also appoint Slaven as club captain. Slaven went on to be named as both the club's and the division's Player of the Year. During this time as a semi-professional he was working as a gardener, but Rovers chairman Tom Fagan demanded \u00a340,000 to sell Slaven, which was a high price for a non-professional third-tier player. Slaven refused to play for Rovers, and was subsequently contacted by a reporter from The Sunday Post, who wrote to 54 English and Scottish clubs on his behalf. Middlesbrough responded to the letter with the offer of a two-week trial."]}, {"page": "Victor Kasule", "response": ["#REDIRECT Vic Kasule"]}, {"page": "List of Hamilton Academical F.C. players", "response": ["|Vic Kasule||||1989\u20131990||12||0||"]}, {"page": "Black Scottish people", "response": ["*Vic Kasule"]}, {"page": "1965 in Scotland", "response": ["* 28 May \u2013 Vic Kasule, footballer"]}, {"page": "Kasule", "response": ["*Vic Kasule (born 1965), Scottish footballer of Ugandan descent"]}]}}
