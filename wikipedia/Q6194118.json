A Great Britain international representative three-quarter back, he played club level rugby league (RL) for Warrington (with whom he won the 1954 Challenge Cup), and Barrow (who he also captained). Challinor later coached Great Britain as well as Barrow, Liverpool City and St. Helens. Challinor is a Warrington Wolves Hall of Fame inductee, only two men have played in, and coached Rugby League World Cup winning Great Britain sides, they are; Eric Ashton, and Jim Challinor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1972 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["|colspan=\"4\"| Jim Challinor"]}, {"page": "Great Britain national rugby league team", "response": ["Clive Sullivan had risen to the Great Britain captaincy, the first black captain of a home international side, and was in charge for the 1972 World Cup held in France. Jim Challinor was coach. Sullivan and Challinor led the under-rated Lions to victory over Australia (27\u201321), France (13\u20134) and New Zealand (53\u201319), claiming a try in each game. Clive scored a long distance try in the final in Stade Gerland, Lyon as they drew with Australia 10\u201310 after extra time. Great Britain won their third World Cup by virtue of having a better qualifying record. Sullivan was the last British captain to lift the World Cup."]}, {"page": "St Helens R.F.C.", "response": ["The 1970s were also seen as a successful spell for St Helens, as they reached three Challenge Cup finals in the period. Jim Challinor took over from Cliff Evans in 1970, and in his first season, he won the Championship, and reached two finals, the Lancashire Cup and Floodlit Trophy, losing both. In this season, a European Championship\u2014not dissimilar to today's World Club Challenge\u2014was contested between St Helens and French champions St Gaudens. Over a two\u2014legged game, St Helens won 92\u201311 on aggregate. In their first Challenge Cup Final of the 1970s, they defeated Leeds in 1972 16\u201313, in addition to winning their first Floodlit Trophy, after losing out in the final three times before, with an 8\u20132 win over Rochdale. The club reached the Championship final in that season, but were beaten. No success was achieved in seasons 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374, with St Helens finishing third and second in the respective years. This could be a possible reason for Jim Challinor's replacement with Eric Ashton as head coach. In Ashton's first season in charge, St Helens won the Championship, and contested the inaugural Premiership Final, losing 26\u201311 to Leeds. They repeated their first Challenge Cup success of the 1970s three years after the first against Widnes in 1976 where they were victorious by 20\u20135 in the famous 'Dads Army' final. They also won the Premiership against Salford, and the Floodlit Trophy against Dewsbury in a successful season. In the same year, St Helens lost to Eastern Suburbs in an unofficial World Club Challenge Final by 25 points to 2. The club won the Premiership in 1977, but, on 13 December 1977, Saints lost 26\u201311 to Hull Kingston Rovers in the final of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy. In 1978 Leeds avenged their 1972 loss against St Helens, emerging winners by 14\u201312. St Helens lost the Floodlit Trophy in the 1978\u201379 season, going down to Widnes. The 1979\u201380 season was unsuccessful, with St Helens finishing mid\u2014table. Eric Ashton left the club after this disappointing year."]}, {"page": "Barrow Raiders", "response": ["In 1963, Jim Challinor moved to Barrow and became their player-coach."]}, {"page": "Stade du Hameau", "response": ["In November 1972, Great Britain, coached by Jim Challinor  beat New Zealand 43 to 13 in the 1972 Rugby League World Cup  in front of 8,000 spectators."]}, {"page": "Eric Ashton", "response": ["Only two men have played in, and coached Rugby League World Cup winning Great Britain sides, they are; Eric Ashton, and Jim Challinor."]}, {"page": "Rugby League World Cup records", "response": ["| Jim Challinor"]}]}}
