Before he could go out to work, the outbreak of the Second World War led him to join the Worcester Regiment. He was taken prisoner at Dunkirk and spent four and  a half years in German prisoner-of-war camps, but escaped in January 1945 and went through Russia to get back to Britain in March 1945.\nAfter the war he qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1949, and in April 1950 became a Partner in Kendall, Wadley and Company, based in Malvern, Worcestershire. At the 1966 general election, he was the Conservative Party candidate in Dudley against George Wigg.\nWhen Wigg resigned, Williams was selected to fight the seat in the ensuing byelection. This came at a time when Harold Wilson's Labour government was very unpopular and Williams achieved a large swing to win the seat in March 1968. In Parliament, Williams was friendly with neighbouring MP Enoch Powell and allied with the right, voting against the Race Relations Bill in 1968 and opposing House of Lords reform.\nWilliams lost his seat at the 1970 general election, with Labour regaining it, although the Conservatives ousted Labour from government at that election. Three years later he was elected to Hereford and Worcester County Council. He was an unsuccessful Conservative candidate for Dudley East at the 1979 general election. He had left his previous accountancy firms, and became a company director of a food company and an electronic engineering company.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*Donald Williams (Dudley), by-election win"]}, {"page": "Dudley North (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["The earlier Dudley constituency, consisting of central Dudley, Netherton, and Stourbridge, was more prominent before 1974. Colonel George Wigg (later Lord Wigg), Prime Minister Harold Wilson's adviser on security matters and later a Minister of State, held the seat for many years until elevated to the peerage in 1968.  At the Dudley by-election in March of that year, Donald Williams, the Conservative candidate, gained the seat with a swing of 20%. In 1970, however, the seat was regained by Labour with the election of Dr John Gilbert, who subsequently represented Dudley East from February 1974 until its abolition at the 1997 general election. Gilbert served as a Minister of State under both James Callaghan and (as a peer) Tony Blair. Dudley West meanwhile was represented, until his death in 1994, by Conservative MP Dr John Blackburn. At the subsequent Dudley West by election the seat was a Labour gain with Ian Pearson elected. After boundary changes, Pearson became the MP for the newly created Dudley South seat at the 1997 election"]}, {"page": "Donald Williams", "response": ["Donald Williams may refer to:", "*Donald Williams (politician) (1919\u20131990), British Conservative Party politician", "*Donald Williams (basketball) (born 1973), American basketball player", "*Donald Williams (field hockey) (born 1966), British former field hockey player"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Donald Williams"]}, {"page": "William Donald Williams", "response": ["#REDIRECT Donald Williams (politician)"]}, {"page": "Dudley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Donald Williams"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Donald Williams; MP for Dudley (1968\u20131970)"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (D)", "response": ["# Donald Williams (politician)"]}, {"page": "1968 Dudley by-election", "response": ["The Dudley by-election, 1968 was a by-election held for the British House of Commons constituency of Dudley in Worcestershire on 28 March 1968.
