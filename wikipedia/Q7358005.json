He is currently professor of architecture at the Azrieli School of Architecture and Urbanism at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.\nConnah studied architecture at Bristol University and Jesus College, Cambridge. In 1974, he moved to Helsinki, Finland, to study the work of architect Reima Pietil\u00e4, and worked in the office of Reima and Raili Pietil\u00e4 until 1985. Connah has specialised in Finnish architecture and society, and has written numerous books on the subject, in particular on the life and works of architects Reima and Raili Pietil\u00e4 and Alvar Aalto, as well as film director Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki. Among his many publications is the book on Pietil\u00e4, Writing Architecture \u2013 Fantomas, Fragments, Fictions (An Architectural Journey through the Twentieth Century) (1989) which was awarded First Prize in the International Book Award in Architectural Theory and Criticism 1987\u201390 by CICA, the International Committee of Architectural Critics. Connah has also held and curated exhibitions, including 'KHAM' (Delhi, 1986) and 'Seven Famous Raincoats and a Moygashel' (1984). His films include 'Involuntary Architecture' (2005, with John Maruszczak).\nIn October 2008, Connah, together with John Maruszczak (and assisted by Ryan Manning), won first prize in the White House Redux competition; the competition invited people to design a new residence for the President of the USA. In the competition, the best ideas, designs, descriptions, images, and videos for a new White House were selected by some of the world's most distinguished designers and critics and, during October 2008, were on display at the Storefront for Art and Architecture, which, in association with Control Group, sponsored the contest. Connah and Maruszczak beat more than 500 other participants to win the competition. They stated that their submission was \"an architectural folk-tale for the future, a hybrid representation using unusual poetics and a provocatively dislocated new media.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki", "response": ["*Roger Connah K/K: A Couple of Finns and Some Donald Ducks: Cinema and Society.

Their basic question is to what extent Pietil\u00e4 goes against the grain of a Finnish modernist architecture concerned with rationalism and economy. The whole question is problematic, however, because Finland's most famous architect, Alvar Aalto, was also seen as someone who broke the mold of pure modernism, someone who indeed talked about extending the notion of rationalism. Pietil\u00e4 saw his work as organic architecture, but also very much as modern. Pietil\u00e4 intellectualised his position, and was well-read in philosophy and modern literature. He was very much concerned with the issue of a phenomenology of place, epitomised by the Student Union building Dipoli (1961\u20131966) on the Otaniemi campus of Helsinki University of Technology. This concern for place also extended to his concerns about national identity and Finnishness, even exploring the Finnish language to generate architectural form. The same then applied also for his works abroad, in Kuwait and Delhi. Many of Reima Pietil\u00e4's theoretical writings were published in the journal Le Carr\u00e9 Bleu, a journal he jointly founded in Helsinki in 1958, together with fellow Finnish architects Aulis Blomstedt and Keijo Pet\u00e4j\u00e4, Finnish architecture historian Ky\u00f6sti \u00c5lander, and French architect Andr\u00e9 Schimmerling, whom together formed the CIAM Helsinki group, the Finnish group associated with CIAM (Congr\u00e8s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne)."]}, {"page": "Juhani Pallasmaa", "response": ["* Roger Connah, The Piglet Years.

The front facade consists of two large cupolas with a central fold above the entrance. The entrance opens into a courtyard with stone masonry and greenery within.

The ubiquitous red brick construction of the building has been compared to early architectural forms prevalent in Mohenjo-daro and the buddhist architecture in Sanchi and Nalanda. Along with two other embassies, the post-modern architecture of the Belgian embassy in New Delhi has been critiqued by Roger Connah for its confusing appeal to pre-colonial glory of Delhi on one hand and the fading (British) empire on the other.  Some parts of the building near the entrance are open to visitors, while the parts hosting the residence and the administrative blocks are not accessible to the public."]}]}}
