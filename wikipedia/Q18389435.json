The end of the church's prophetical element was underlined by the adoption in 1843 of an elaborate new liturgy. This was mainly the product of Cardale's efforts and it reflected his researches into the Eastern and Catholic offices, as well as the Anglican rites of his upbringing. The church's liturgy was enlarged in 1846 to include the rite of \"sealing\". In 1851 Cardale published the Readings upon the Liturgy in which he extensively describes the various source for the liturgy and how the must be conducted. Around 1860 John Bate Cardale and Edward Wilton Eddis participated in the committee that edited the first Catholic Apostolic Hymnal: Hymns for the Use of the Churches which appeared in 1864 for the first time.Cardale in committee Hymn-book, apostolische-dokumente.de, retrieved 26 October 2014"]}, {"page": "Edmund Hart Turpin", "response": ["* the Hymn Tunes, published in 1872.
