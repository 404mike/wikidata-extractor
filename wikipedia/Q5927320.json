Just two and a half months later at the height of the Race for the Sea, General Hamilton was killed by artillery fire whilst surveying the front line, the first British divisional commander to be killed in action during the conflict. He had received several honours for his service and was popular amongst his men, who nicknamed him \"Hammy\" and expressed sorrow at his death; each regiment in his division despatched representatives to his funeral, despite being involved in heavy fighting less than a mile away.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "3rd (United Kingdom) Division", "response": ["During the First World War the 3rd Division was a permanently established Regular Army division that was amongst the first to be sent to France at the outbreak of the war as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).

Its first commander during the war, Major-General Hubert Hamilton, was killed by shellfire near B\u00e9thune in October 1914.

Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Morant had brought in a group of Boers who surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders received from Kitchener, relayed through Colonel Hubert Hamilton, decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Explaining that \"The gentlemen's war is over\", Hunt orders the prisoners to be shot, as Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners. According to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing white flags. Morant ordered the prisoners disarmed, lined up and shot. One charged Witton, who killed the prisoner with his revolver."]}, {"page": "Court-martial of Breaker Morant", "response": ["When the trial resumed on January 18, 1902, \"the Court allowed the question.\" Lieut.

Peter Handcock, had received the same orders from Captain Hunt.", "In the trial itself, Lieutenant Colonel Hubert Hamilton categorically denied giving Captain Percy Frederic Hunt orders to shoot POWs; he also denied the existence of a coded telegram from him to Lord Roberts. Even so, Thomas still demanded the acquittal of his clients on the grounds that they believed that they acted under orders. In response, the prosecutor argued that, even if Kitchener had ordered the shooting of prisoners, they were \"illegal orders\", and that the defendants had no right to obey them. The judges agreed with the prosecution and found the defendants guilty."]}, {"page": "Cheriton, Kent", "response": ["There were four churches in the Benefice of Cheriton, which comes under the Deanery of Elham.

The churchyard contains the grave of shipping reformer Samuel Plimsoll (whose gravestone bears the Plimsoll line), and, among many military burials, 24 CWGC-registered war graves, with all three armed forces represented, 15 from World War I (Major-General Hubert Hamilton being the first and highest-ranking of the latter) and nine from World War II.
