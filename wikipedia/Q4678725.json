More than 50,000 spectators attended the fixture and Leicester enjoyed the better play of the first half but it was Cardiff who took the lead early in the second half when Beadles headed in from Willie Davies' cross. Leicester quickly equalised when Arthur Chandler's shot was parried by Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Farquharson, allowing Johnny Duncan to lift the ball over the stricken keeper and into the net. In the final moments of the game, Leicester defender Adam Black cleared the ball out for an opposition corner after being pressured in possession. Willie Davies took the corner for Cardiff, sending the ball into the box where it looped over the head of the opposition goalkeeper and into the net. The Times match report described the goal, writing \"As it came across it seemed to hang in the wind and then took a quick swerve, curling into the farther corner of the net.\" The referee immediately blew his whistle for both the goal and the end of the match. As the rule stopping a player to score directly from a corner kick had only been lifted the previous year, there was initially confusion in the ground as to whether the goal stood before some Cardiff fans invaded the pitch and engulfed Willie Davies in celebration. He later recalled his goal and the moments after, remarking \"I took it in a hurry with my right foot. The swerve on the ball beat everybody and it went straight into the net! I had forgotten, in the excitement, that a goal could now be scored direct from the corner-flag, but the next minute I was being mobbed by thousands of spectators.\" Despite some celebrations, there were still large parts of the crowd who were unsure whether the goal stood and the overall outcome of the match. Cardiff captain Jimmy Blair and Willie Davies had to return to the pitch from the dressing room to make an announcement to the waiting crowd that the goal stood and Cardiff had subsequently progressed."]}]}}
