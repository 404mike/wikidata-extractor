Known for his uncompromising defensive style, manager Bill Shankly once said of him: \"Tommy Smith wasn't born, he was quarried\". A central defender for most of his career, Smith's most memorable moment for the club probably came when he scored Liverpool's second goal in the 1977 European Cup Final against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. Smith played once for England in 1971, and also played at club level for Tampa Bay Rowdies, Los Angeles Aztecs and Swansea City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 5", "response": ["*  1945   \u2013 Tommy Smith, English footballer (d. 2019)"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.", "response": ["| Tommy Smith || 1970\u20131973"]}, {"page": "Stan Kelly-Bootle", "response": ["*O Liverpool We Love You, Transatlantic Records XTRA 1076, released 1976.

In 1985, Caernarfon Town were runners-up in the first division and were elected to the Northern Premier League. Despite a poor start, new manager John King turned playing affairs round and the club enjoyed its most successful FA Cup run in 1986\u201387. Caernarfon Town defeated Fourth Division Stockport County at the Oval and then defeated Third Division York City in a replay before losing a third round replay again to Second Division Barnsley by a goal to nil. The Canaries finished third in the NPL and felt that, if not for the FA Cup run, they would probably have gained promotion to the Football Conference. In May 1987, King left to become manager of Tranmere Rovers and former Liverpool wing-half Tommy Smith was appointed manager but left in December 1987 after a series of poor results, giving way to Phil Wilson who had been a player with the club the previous season."]}, {"page": "Bill Shankly", "response": ["Liverpool consolidated in 1962\u201363, finishing eighth in their first top flight season under Shankly's management. Significant signings were wing half Willie Stevenson from Rangers in 1962 and left winger Peter Thompson from Preston in 1963.Kelly, pp. 175\u2013177. Shankly described the Thompson deal as \"daylight robbery\".Kelly, p. 177. Liverpool's youth system produced more future England internationals in Ian Callaghan, Tommy Smith and Chris Lawler.Shankly, pp. 97\u201399. The hard work paid off in 1963\u201364 when Liverpool won their sixth League Championship title, ending the season with a 5\u20130 defeat of Arsenal at Anfield.Shankly, p. 94. According to Roger Hunt, the secret of Liverpool's success was that, under Shankly, they were the fittest team in the country.Kelly, p. 180. In 1964, Jimmy Melia was transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers;Kelly, p. 184. with Shankly buying Arsenal's utility player Geoff Strong for \u00a340,000 and this was Liverpool's last significant transfer activity until 1967.Kelly, p. 188.", "In the 1969\u201370 FA Cup quarter final, Liverpool played against struggling Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost 1\u20130 after a very poor performance. The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled the end for St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, in the case of Heighway, from non-league football.Shankly, pp. 115\u2013117. Adding the new players to Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan, Chris Lawler and Emlyn Hughes, Shankly formed the nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate English and European football in the 1970s.", "Shankly formed a special bond with the Liverpool supporters and, at the end of the 1961\u201362 season when Liverpool won the Second Division championship, he told the Liverpool Echo: \"In all sincerity, I can say that they are the greatest crowd of supporters in the game\".Kelly, p. 171. In Tommy Smith's view, Shankly was completely in tune with the city of Liverpool; he loved the supporters and they loved him, mainly because they knew he understood them.Smith, p. 285.", "Shankly was 60 when Liverpool won the 1974 FA Cup final and said in his autobiography that, on returning to the dressing room at the end of the match, he felt tired from all the years.Shankly, p. 141. His mind was made up and he knew he was going to retire. His wife, Nessie, had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time. Tommy Smith said that Shankly's feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision.Smith, p. 286. In 1974, he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret, which was that he did not win the European Cup.Shankly, p. 142.", "From Liverpool's point of view, the situation was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that, by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley's status as manager. On one visit to Melwood, a player opined to Shankly that Paisley had made a good start in the job. Shankly retorted: \"I could have left a monkey in charge!\" Shankly's visits even went as far as actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. As a visitor at Melwood, he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he did not work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.", "Although some club officials like secretary Peter Robinson wanted bygones to be bygones, Tommy Smith summarised the board's view as one of satisfaction that Shankly had gone at last. There was a perception that Shankly was an overbearing figure, who could use a position on the board to be a \"back-seat driver\", and the board were well aware that Matt Busby's time as a Manchester United director had been disastrous. Busby's successors had complained about being undermined by his continued presence at United, who had been relegated in 1974. While Liverpool's treatment of Shankly may have seemed disrespectful, they were acting in the best interests of the club and its new manager by pursuing the same relentless winning ethic that Shankly himself had instilled. In any event, their perceived ruthlessness was vindicated by the unprecedented haul of League Championship titles and European Cups won over the next decade under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan."]}, {"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["Scunthorpe United could not afford a set of football nets and trained on a rugby pitch at Quibell Park. They also, risking injury, had five-a-side training sessions on the Old Showground concrete car park. Still though, at Scunthorpe Keegan would take his training very seriously. Twice a week, after training, Keegan would train with a teammate named Derek Hemstead and they would train by doing weighted farmers walks up and down the cantilever stand at the Old Showground. A trait Keegan had was his running ability. In running drills at Scunthorpe Keegan liked trying to finish first and Keegan was told by Jack Brownsword that one thing he has going for him is that he is a one hundred percenter and he should never lose that. Though this will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior pros such as Liverpool's Tommy Smith and Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.", "In the 1974 final, Liverpool played Newcastle United. Keegan explained that Shankly's motivation was made easy after the pre-game talking by Supermac (Malcolm Macdonald) and to a lesser extent John Tudor. Tudor and Keegan's friend, Macdonald, gave interviews confidently proclaiming they had more ability whilst also being critical of older Liverpool pros such as Tommy Smith. Keegan also believed Shankly may have got into the heads of the Newcastle players when on the night before the game Shankly and Joe Harvey were being interviewed and Shankly was heard on the microphone, but off-camera, stating, \"Joe looks a bag of nerves...\" Keegan explained, knowing Shankly it would not surprise him if this was not an accident and Shankly knew what he was doing and that this statement was meant to neutralise any of Newcastle's confidence and that this did indeed rub off into the heads of some of the Newcastle players who became anxious. In the final, Keegan scored two as Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3\u20130. It was the first brace in an FA Cup final since Mike Trebilcock scored twice for Everton in 1966. The game against Newcastle was Keegan's first FA Cup Final. To Keegan, with the 100,000 inside the ground, the non-stop chanting of both sets of fans, and then the millions watching on TV, this game was as close to a non drug-induced psychedelic experience as he could ever get. He noted how after this final Shankly, he and the other Liverpool players were sympathetic to the devastated Newcastle players and tried to not rub it in with their victory."]}, {"page": "Tom Hicks", "response": ["\"It\u2019s like a huge cloud has been lifted off us...

A lot has been taken off the club\u2019s shoulders now. Good riddance to Hicks and Gillett.\" Former Liverpool player Tommy Smith expressed his joy at the departure of Hicks and Gillett in his regular newspaper column: \"But today they are out of our club \u2013 and I\u2019m as happy as every one of the Liverpool fans who\u2019ve made it clear they\u2019re so sick of them.

Good riddance.\" After selling the club, Hicks admitted that his relationship with the fans had been strained: \"Something went wrong with my ability to communicate with the fans. I am saddened by it.\""]}]}}
