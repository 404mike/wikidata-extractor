She is also known for her personal diaries, which were edited into two volumes by W.F. Cater for the popular market and published posthumously.\nFountaine was an accomplished natural history illustrator and had a great love and knowledge of butterflies, travelling and collecting extensively through Europe, South Africa, India, Tibet, America, Australia and the West Indies, publishing numerous papers on her work. She raised many of the butterflies from eggs or caterpillars, producing specimens of great quality, 22,000 of which are housed at the Norwich Castle Museum and known as the Fountaine-Neimy Collection. Her four sketch books of butterfly life-cycles are held at the Natural History Museum in London. The butterfly genus Fountainea was named in her honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 16", "response": ["*1862 \u2013 Margaret Fountaine, English lepidopterist and diarist (d.1940)"]}, {"page": "Norfolk", "response": ["* Margaret Fountaine, butterfly collector, was born in Norfolk, and her collection is housed in Norwich Castle Museum"]}, {"page": "Emilie Snethlage", "response": ["She died of heart failure in Porto Velho, Rond\u00f4nia, and was buried at the cemetery of inocentes while on a field trip.

Merian's scientific expedition of Surinam predated Alexander von Humboldt's famous South America expedition by 100 years, and that of Princess Theresa of Bavaria by 200 years.

Rothschild's Tring collection was eventually taken over by the Natural History Museum. Miles-Moss' lepidoptera specimens are still considered a valuable resource today and 25,000 Brazilian lepidoptera are stored in the Natural History Museum at Tring. Due to his accurate artwork and precision, Miles-Moss' collection of lepidoptera drawings and notes are so important they are maintained in a separate collection at the Natural History Museum today.
