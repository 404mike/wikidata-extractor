Paxton had three top-10 finishes in the Open Championship. He took second place in the 1880 Open Championship five shots behind winner Bob Ferguson. Paxton was an expert club and ball maker.  His golf ball inventions included the Bramble and Sirdar models, the former being the ball of choice for Harry Vardon at one time.  Paxton was also the designer of a number of golf courses, with Coventry Golf Club (Coventry, England) and East Berkshire Golf Club (East Berkshire, England) being among those designs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Open Championship", "response": ["|align=center|20th || align=center|1880 ||  Bob Ferguson || align=center|162 || || 5 strokes ||  Peter Paxton || align=center|Not known || align=\"center\" |8 || Musselburgh"]}, {"page": "Bob Ferguson (golfer)", "response": ["| align=center|1880 ||The Open Championship ||1 shot lead || 40-41-42-39=162 ||5 strokes || Peter Paxton"]}, {"page": "1880 Open Championship", "response": ["The 1880 Open Championship was the 20th Open Championship, held 9 April at Musselburgh Links, Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland.

Heavy rain the day before had soaked the course making approach shots and putting difficult. Playing in stiff winds, the first 27 holes were stubbornly contested to a draw, but Tingey pulled away in the end winning 4 and 3."]}, {"page": "Paxton, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Paxton"]}]}}
