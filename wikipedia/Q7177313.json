The character of Nagasaki was a Japanese samurai with a mysterious past and reputed powers of healing and hypnosis. He was one of the biggest draws of all time in British wrestling, especially in the mid-1970s and the turn of the 1980s/1990s.Thornley wore a mask for most of his career, the one significant exception being several months following a December 1977 televised voluntary unmasking ceremony.  He originally retired in 1978 but returned to active competition briefly in 1981 and then again from 1986 to 1993. Thereafter he made sporadic wrestling appearances.Thornley gave occasional interviews as Kendo Nagasaki, usually photographed fully masked or with his face hidden, and often speaking through a representative. The character's voice was never heard in public. His identity as the man behind Kendo Nagasaki was first revealed publicly by a plumber who visited his house in the 1970s and again during a 2002 court case over a land dispute with his neighbour. Thornley never spoke publicly about being Kendo Nagasaki until the publication of his autobiography in 2018 and during interviews to promote the book.Away from the ring, Thornley has been a successful business entrepreneur and also had a career in rock management for around a decade from the late 1970s to the late 1980s, managing Cuddly Toys and Laura Pallas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 19", "response": ["*1941 \u2013 Peter Thornley, English professional wrestler best known for the ring character Kendo NagasakiThe Eighth Wonder of the World: The True Story of Andr\u00e9 the Giant - Bertrand H\u00e9bert, Pat Laprade, Tony Stabile - Google Books"]}, {"page": "1941", "response": ["* October 19 \u2013 Peter Thornley, English professional wrestler best known for the ring character Kendo Nagasaki"]}, {"page": "Stoke-on-Trent", "response": ["Other notable sports people from the area include footballers turned TV pundits Mark Bright, Garth Crooks and Robbie Earle; tennis player Andrew Foster; snooker players Ray Reardon, Dave Harold and Jamie Cope; field hockey player Imran Sherwani; cycling world-record holder Tommy Godwin, wrestler Peter Thornley (better known as Kendo Nagasaki), professional strongman Eddie Hall and European taekwondo champion Charlie Maddock."]}, {"page": "Wrestling mask", "response": ["The most famous masked wrestler in British history, Peter Thornley, the original British version of Kendo Nagasaki made his professional debut - complete with masked Samurai gimmick - in 1964 but did not appear on television until 1971.
