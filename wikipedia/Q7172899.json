Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1996 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107.

This optimism was particularly buoyed by the 1976 election of President Jimmy Carter, who spoke in favor of decriminalization during his presidential campaign (earning him the support of Stroup and NORML).  Carter was urged to speak in support of decriminalization by Peter Bourne, an Atlanta physician who grew close to Carter during his time as Georgia governor.  Upon being elected president, Carter gave Bourne an office in the West Wing and the official title \"Special Assistant to the President for Drug Abuse\".  From this position, Bourne continued to advocate for cannabis decriminalization, while also developing a close relationship with Stroup and NORML.  In August 1977, the White House issued its first official position paper on drug policy, which Stroup helped draft.  Included in the paper was a call for up to one ounce of cannabis to be decriminalized at the federal level.", "The resignation of Peter Bourne was considered a significant blow to decriminalization efforts in a number of ways.  First, there were no advisers pushing Carter to support decriminalization anymore, as Bourne's successor Lee Dogoloff was not particularly sympathetic to the cause.  Also, the embarrassment of the Bourne scandal, along with allegations of drug use that had been made against other members of the administration, made decriminalization a much more politically sensitive topic that Carter thus sought to avoid.  It was not just the Carter administration that had been damaged from the incident, however.  Stroup's role in the scandal proved to be a major embarrassment for NORML, and by December 1978 led to his resignation, due to the anger and distrust that his actions had caused.  The departure of Stroup also caused NORML to lose the support of some of its top donors, including its largest benefactor the Playboy Foundation."]}, {"page": "Bourne (surname)", "response": ["* Peter Bourne (born 1939), anthropologist, writer, and civil servant"]}, {"page": "Presidency of Jimmy Carter", "response": ["Carter took a stance in support of decriminalization of cannabis, citing the legislation passed in Oregon in 1973.
