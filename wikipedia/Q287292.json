The host city also produced the winner of a closely contested female bout at the 60\u00a0kg lightweight category, when Rotunda ABC's Natasha Jonas pipped Hartlepool's Amanda Coulson by one point. Rotunda ABC's Callum Smith, the youngest of the Smith brothers, also boxed his way to a gold medal in the 69\u00a0kg category when he took on fellow Scouser Anthony Fowler of Golden Gloves ABC. Northside ABC's Tommy Stubbs recorded a victory over Wales' Andrew Selby in the 52\u00a0kg Flyweight division. BBC provided coverage of the tournament.", "The 2011 GB Amateur Boxing Championships were staged at York Hall, London on 11 and 12 November 2011. The most hotly anticipated bout going into the second GB Championships was in the flyweight division between Welshman Andrew Selby and Khalid Yafai of England. After both boxers had got past the quarter-final stage of 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Baku one month previous, it meant they would have to box off for a place at the 2012 Summer Olympics if neither boxer took gold in Azerbaijan, and Selby missed that achievement by the narrowest of margins in the final, losing 13:12. The pair met on 11 November for the first of a scheduled three fights to decide which boxer would secure Olympic qualification, with Selby recording a convincing 26:12 victory. On 12 November it was reported that Yafai had pulled out of their next encounter because he couldn't make the weight, thus granting the Welshman Olympic qualification and denying Yafai of a second Olympic Games. In other bouts, Warren Baister claimed gold with an impressive win in the 91\u00a0kg final. Salisbury ABC's Sam Maxwell earned a hard-fought 16:14 win over Wales' Joe Cordina who had beaten tournament favorite Iain Weaver the previous day. Another Liverpool boxer, Anthony Fowler beat Kieran Smith 15:9, and his conqueror of last year's championships, Callum Smith won at the 75\u00a0kg division. In the female contest, Amanda Coulsen beat Chantelle Cameron in a competitive bout, Natasha Jonas who denied Coulson of gold last year did not enter, neither did Olympians Tom Stalker, Anthony Joshua and Luke Campbell. BBC once again broadcast the event on BBC One and betting operator Betfair sponsored Team GB."]}]}}
