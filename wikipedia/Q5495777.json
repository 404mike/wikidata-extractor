It contains all the information obtainable from 1746 to 1878, with a supplement concerning notable players for the next 20 years. The volumes appeared at fairly regular intervals between 1862 and 1879. The first four, bound in purple cloth, were published by Fred Lillywhite, son of William Lillywhite.
