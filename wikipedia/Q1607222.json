He saw big advantages for the transportation of coal to the early industrialised region in and around the Wupper valley.

Charles May had joined the company in 1836, and played a major part in the expansion, as he was a brilliant chemist and scientist. In 1837 William Worby the works manager was asked to find a new location for some of the workforce, as the St Margaret's Ditches site was no longer big enough. He found an old shipyard on the eastern bank of the River Orwell, covering . This became the Orwell Works, and the company embarked on the construction of a dock scheme, to give them over  of quay on the eastern edge of the new wet dock, construction of which had begun in 1837, and continued for some five years.
