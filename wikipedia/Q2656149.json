The project was first revealed in January 2015 at a Focus Home event. For a short time, the developer considered setting the game in 1950s America, but after narrative director St\u00e9phane Beauverger joined the project, it was discarded to inspire a more gothic mood with focus on the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, set in London. The paintings of Phil Hale influenced the art style, also for the purpose of atmosphere. Dontnod researched the setting by visiting London and taking photographs, but since the city had been largely rebuilt, history books and documentaries concerning Whitechapel, the London Docks, and the Isle of Dogs were also consulted. The literary sources Liquid History: The Thames Through Time and The Book of Facial Expressions: Babies to Teens provided geographical and anthropological insight, respectively, while the television series Casualty 1900s and The Knick were turned to for medical information. Anthony Howell was hired to voice Jonathan Reid. The characters and dialogue were scripted by two French writers and translated into English by two native speakers. Dontnod decided on the British accent, though the marketing department wanted more. The period was studied using both factual and fictional reference points to create the visuals, realised with photorealistic lighting, and post-processes running on the Unreal Engine 4. Motion capture was used to track character movement. In August 2016, the major obstacles in developing the Xbox One version had been overcome with the assurance that there would be no downgrades despite its hardware disadvantages.

While the team members had experience in AAA development, No Code had a limited budget, which forced the team to come up with unique solutions to save money without compromising quality. To simulate the lack of gravity in space during motion-capture acting sessions, the team pushed an animator around on a bar stool. No Code's philosophy was to save on development costs by only paying special attention to things the player would notice. For things like dialogue between characters in cutscenes, the development team opted to do things like move them behind closed doors out of sight from the player, so that the conversations did not have to be animated. It was this philosophy that caused No Code to invest a lot of time in pre-production, creating a lot of modular environments that could be repurposed throughout the game."]}]}}
