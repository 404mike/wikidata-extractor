Varma and Dr. William Edward Mcculloch were the only physicians willing to publish their views in favour of controlling the birth rate. Their view was that the extremely high birth rate in Jamaica was a hindrance to economic progress. The doctor's views were refuted by the churches, which though concerned about illegitimacy, felt that birth control was a family matter. Bailey, saw the issue as one that addressed gender and racial inequalities. She organized, with the help of Farquharson and Judith Decordova, a charity worker, a three-month lecture tour throughout Jamaica by Edith How-Martyn, a British feminist and birth control advocate.

The goal of these organizations was to promote birth control among the populace as a means to improve their social condition, provide care and education about health needs to mothers and children, and to enlist government backing of the program. To that end, Farquharson kept a wide correspondence with other reformers, such as Vera Houghton, Edith How-Martyn, and Margaret Sanger, as well as birth control suppliers, such as Holland\u2013Rantos. Reformers, such as Farquharson, saw their clients in Jamaica as a special population, which needed unique contraception methods and education techniques. Much of this attitude came out of the Eugenics movement of the 1930s, which saw the Afro-Jamaican poor as a culturally different and backward segment of society. Though in some ways, the efforts of the FPLJ were opposed by the Catholic Church of Jamaica, clergy and birth control advocates were in agreement that illegitimacy and co-habitation without marriage were social ills. Farquharson and the FPLJ, believed that limiting birth rates would not only reduce immorality, but also would diminish demand on the over-burdened and under-funded health services."]}, {"page": "Mary Morris Knibb", "response": ["Morris Knibb was one of the leaders in the fight for Jamaican suffrage and as it had been a long-practiced method for women to gain a foothold and show their readiness to vote, she was in favor of women running for local offices.
