Their work to reunite the garden with its wider landscape is described in Adam's 2008 book, Sissinghurst: An Unfinished History, which won the Ondaatje Prize, and was the subject of a BBC Four documentary, Sissinghurst, in 2009. Their efforts have generated some controversy, reflecting the tension between the demands of traditional agricultural practices and the requirements of a major tourism destination in the 21st century.", "Sackville-West's planting philosophy is summed up in the advice from one of her gardening columns in the Observer: \"Cram, cram, cram, every chink and cranny\". Gardener Sarah Raven (Adam Nicolson's wife) notes the use of the vertical dimension, as well as horizontal paths, in her planting. Assisted by the number of walls still standing from the Tudor manor, and constructing more of her own, Sackville-West remarked \"I see we are going to have heaps of wall space for climbing things.\"", "In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed \u2013 the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden \u2013 and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \"Mecca\" and a \"place of pilgrimage\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.", "The Rose Garden was constructed on the site of the old kitchen garden from 1937. It terminates the north\u2013south axis running from the White Garden and concludes with a brick wall, designed by A. R. Powys and known as the Powys Wall, constructed in 1935. Old garden roses, those bred before 1867, formed the heart of the garden's planting. Such roses appealed not only for their lavish appearance, but also for their history. The informal and unstructured massing of the plants was Sackville-West's deliberate choice, and has become one of Sissinghurst's defining features. Roses were supplied by, among others, Hilda Murrell of Edwin Murrell Ltd., notable rose growers in Shropshire, and the florist Constance Spry from her home Winkfield Place. In addition to using established suppliers and receiving plants as gifts from friends, Sackville-West sometimes sourced specimens herself. Sarah Raven records Sackville-West digging up the hybrid perpetual rose 'Souvenir du Docteur Jamain' at an old nursery; Anne Scott-James noted that the rose had passed out of commerce and it was Sackville-West who returned it to cultivation. The Rose Garden is divided by the Roundel, constructed of yew hedging by Nicolson and Nigel in 1933. As elsewhere in the garden, the Trust has replaced the original grass paths with stone and brick, to cope with the increases in visitor numbers. Scott-James considered the roses in the Rose Garden \"one of the finest collections in the world\". The writer Jane Brown describes the Rose Garden, more than any other including the White, as expressing \"the essence of Vita's gardening personality, just as her writing-room enshrines her poetic ghost\"."]}, {"page": "Celebrity gardener", "response": ["* Sarah Raven \u2013 BBC2's Gardeners' World"]}, {"page": "Adam Nicolson", "response": ["Nicolson met his first wife, the writer Olivia Fane, when he was a student at Cambridge University.
