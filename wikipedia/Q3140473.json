It was of Smith that Shelley said: \"Is it not odd that the only truly generous person I ever knew who had money enough to be generous with should be a stockbroker?

Shelley and Smith both chose a passage from the writings of the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus  in Bibliotheca historica, which described a massive Egyptian statue and quoted its inscription: \"King of Kings Ozymandias am I.

He spent his year visiting many people, including members of the British nobility. The popularity of his magazine decreased over that year due to a lack of quality works, except for a series by Leigh Hunt, A Jar of Honey from Mount Hybla. Even Ainsworth's own work, St James's, was damaged because it was written in haste. During this time, Ainsworth began one of his best novels, Auriol, but it was never finished. It was published in part between 1844 and 1845 as Revelations of London. Hablot Browne, using the name \"Phiz\", illustrated the work and became the main illustrator for the magazine. The novel was being produced until Ainsworth and Mortimer fought in early 1845 and Ainsworth resigned as editor. Soon afterwards, Ainsworth bought The New Monthly Magazine and started asking contributors to Ainsworth's Magazine to join him at the new periodical. He issued an advertisement saying that there would be contributors of \"high rank\", which caused Thackeray to attack him in Punch for favouring the nobility. However, Thackeray later contributed to the magazine, along with others including Hunt, E V Keanley, G P R James, Horace Smith, and Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Ainsworth reprinted many of his own works in the magazine along with his own portrait, the latter provoking a mock portrait of the back of Ainsworth's head in Punch as the only angle that Ainsworth had not yet published for the public.Ellis 1979 Vol 2 pp. 71\u201378, 110\u201328"]}, {"page": "Chigwell School", "response": ["* Horace Smith, poet"]}, {"page": "Tor", "response": ["* Tor Hill, 1826 novel by Horace Smith"]}, {"page": "Giovanni Battista Belzoni", "response": ["Horace Smith, a poet in the circle of Percy Bysshe Shelley, wrote \" Address to the Mummy in Belzoni's Exhibition.\""]}, {"page": "Oxford period poetry anthologies", "response": ["Miles Peter Andrews \u2013 Joanna Baillie \u2013 Samuel Bamford \u2013 Anna Laetitia Barbauld \u2013 Thomas Beck \u2013 William Blake \u2013 William Lisle Bowles \u2013 Robert Burns \u2013 George Gordon, Lord Byron \u2013 Thomas Campbell \u2013 George Canning \u2013 John Clare \u2013 Samuel Taylor Coleridge \u2013 Hannah Cowley \u2013 William Cowper \u2013 George Crabbe \u2013 George Croly \u2013 William Crowe \u2013 Charlotte Dacre \u2013 George Darley \u2013 Erasmus Darwin \u2013 Ebenezer Elliott \u2013 Catherine Maria Fanshawe \u2013 John Hookham Frere \u2013 William Gifford \u2013 Felicia Dorothea Hemans \u2013 James Hogg \u2013 William Hone \u2013 Thomas Hood \u2013 Leigh Hunt \u2013 Sir William Jones \u2013 John Keats \u2013 Charles Lamb \u2013 Mary Lamb \u2013 Laetitia Elizabeth Landon \u2013 Walter Savage Landor \u2013 Joseph Lees \u2013 Matthew Gregory Lewis \u2013 Charles Lloyd (poet) \u2013 Henry Luttrell \u2013 John Herman Merivale \u2013 Robert Merry \u2013 Mary Russell Mitford \u2013 James Montgomery \u2013 Thomas Moore \u2013 John Moultrie \u2013 Caroline Oliphant \u2013 Amelia Opie \u2013 Sydney Owenson \u2013 William Parsons \u2013 Thomas Love Peacock \u2013 Richard Polwhele \u2013 Winthrop Mackworth Praed \u2013 William Probert \u2013 Bryan Waller Procter \u2013 Edward Quillinan \u2013 Ann Radcliffe \u2013 Mary Robinson \u2013 Samuel Rogers \u2013 William Roscoe \u2013 Thomas Russell \u2013 Walter Scott \u2013 Anna Seward \u2013 Percy Bysshe Shelley \u2013 Charlotte Turner Smith \u2013 Horace Smith \u2013 James Smith \u2013 Robert Southey \u2013 Thomas Tod Stoddart \u2013 Ann Taylor \u2013 Jane Taylor \u2013 William Taylor \u2013 William Tennant \u2013 Alfred Tennyson \u2013 John Thelwall \u2013 Mary Tighe \u2013 Helen Maria Williams \u2013 John Wolcot \u2013 Charles Wolfe \u2013 William Wordsworth \u2013 Ann Yearsley"]}, {"page": "William Stewart Rose", "response": ["Suffering a stroke in 1824, Rose retired on a pension from his House of Lords post.
