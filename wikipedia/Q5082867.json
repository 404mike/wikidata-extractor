It is awarded annually and unlike other Royal Society awards such as the Hughes Medal, it has been presented every year since its inception.  The winner is required to present a lecture as part of the Society's annual programme of public events, which is usually held in January of the following year; during the lecture, the President of the Royal Society awards the medal. Unlike other prizes awarded by the society, the committee has not always publicly provided a rationale. This has occurred five times\u2014in 2004 to Martin Rees, in 2006 to Richard Fortey, in 2007 to Jim Al-Khalili,  in 2008 to John D.
