He played ten internationals for Wales, and was selected for the British Lions playing in all six tests of the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand.Evans was a hard tackling flanker, but his skill was seen in his intelligent defensive positioning. He would often sit behind the three midfield players in offence to ensure that if passing movements broke down the opposition could not counterattack. He specialised in subduing fly-half play and would often disrupt opposing midfield trios into poor positions causing errors in play without even engaging them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Evans (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bob Evans (restaurateur) (1918\u20132007), restaurateur and founder of Bob Evans Restaurants", "*Bob Evans (musician) (born 1977), stagename of Australian musician Kevin Edward Mitchell", "*Bob Evans (coach) (Melbourne C.
