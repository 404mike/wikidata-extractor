He also rode Bultacos, later selling his half-share in a garage to fund his full-time racing using a 350 cc AJS 7R and a 500 cc Matchless G50 for the 'classic' races.His big break came when he was signed for the Honda factory team in July 1966, and later rode for Suzuki.\nHis best season was in 1967 when he won two Grand Prix races and finished the year in third place in both the 50cc and the 125cc world championships.\nIn the early 1970s he began car racing in Saloon classes, retiring in 1980 to concentrate on his business interests including a Honda dealership. Again reviving his racing in 1986, Graham has continued to appear in occasional historic car events.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isle of Man TT", "response": ["| Steve Abbott, Dario Ambrosini, Frank A Applebee, Ivor Arber, Reg Armstrong, Kenny Arthur, Stewart Atkinson, Georg Auerbacher, Mike Aylott, Mark Baldwin, Rob Barber, W.
