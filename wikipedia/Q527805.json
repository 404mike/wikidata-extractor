One common factor was the clockwork universe view.

Oldenburg eventually became the tutor to Boyle's nephew, the politician Richard Jones, and travelled with him through France from 1657 to 1660.

He was home-schooled until the age of eight, began his formal schooling in the sixth grade, and graduated from high school while still only 15. After a gap year auditing classes at Mount Holyoke College (where his father had become a professor) he entered Harvard, intending to major in chemistry and go into medicine, but ended up studying mathematics instead. His first mathematics publication was written as an undergraduate, after he discovered an incorrect proof in another paper. He got his A.B. degree in 1933, received a Sheldon Fellowship for a year of travel, and returned to Harvard for his doctoral studies in 1934. He earned his doctorate there in 1937, under the supervision of David Widder."]}, {"page": "Science in the Renaissance", "response": ["Marie Boas Hall coined the term Scientific Renaissance to designate the early phase of the Scientific Revolution, 1450\u20131630.
