This interpretation is illustrated by the pendant, the companion piece  Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan (1889), which visually complements the Self-Portrait. De Haan's devilish eyes and red hair shaped like horns in his portrait on the left side of the dining room where it was created in situ, corresponds to the snake held in Gauguin's hand in his self-portrait on the right door of the dining room.  Two books appear on the table in de Haan's portrait: Paradise Lost (1667\u201374) by seventeenth-century English poet John Milton, and Sartor Resartus by Thomas Carlyle.  These respective literary allusions, to Milton's Satan and to Carlyle's Diogenes Teufelsdr\u00f6ckh, a character described as both angelic and diabolical, play directly into de Haan's and Gauguin's corresponding self-portraits. Jirat-Wasiuty\u0144ski argues that Gauguin portrays himself as a magus, as  \"both seer and demonic angel\"."]}]}}
