Widely flagged as a means to preserve ARAG's capability, the Defence Academy's Director General, Lieutenant General Andrew Graham, told the staff that he was 'passionate about research' and that the capability was secure under his tenure.  However less than three months later and despite having an annual budget of less than \u00a31 million, ARAG was closed down in February 2010 by General Graham as a cost-saving measure. The move was widely condemned, with letters of protest being sent from government departments, the security services, former senior members of the US government, academia and other organisations.  However ARAG and its new head had already made itself unpopular in Whitehall for pointing out the many failures of government departments and agencies as part of their 'red-teaming' function.   R&AB also made itself unpopular within the Defence Academy itself \u2013 suggesting that whilst over 300 military officers graduated each year from the JSCSC Staff Courses there was no measure of effectiveness of the courses and no way to measure their value for money.  R&AB staff also pointed out inconsistencies and failings of the various contracts and PFIs that existed in the Defence Academy.  For example, despite Kings College London and SERCO receiving millions in public money, no online research papers were available to students - a basic research tool enjoyed by every other university in the UK - and basic administrative functions were hugely and disproportionately expensive.  As a consequence many senior officers were reluctant to make a case for its retention.  The comments from Kings College London Staff were particularly revealing.  The BBC featured its demise, twice, in The World at One on 3 Feb 2010 and a large number of PQs were raised by various MPs.  The answers provided by the then Minister for the Armed Forces, Bill Rammell, were confused and suggested that ARAG's functions would be handed to other organisations - a clear breach of negotiated Union arrangements and as such the basis of an ongoing dispute between the Defence Academy and the Prospect Union.  Since the vast majority of ARAG and R&AB's work was undertaken in organic language analysis, it is unclear how such functions could be fulfilled by Kings College London or Cranfield University.  In discussions with staff after the decision it became apparent that the senior management of the Defence Academy were unaware of much of the work R&AB had undertaken - a failing that many of the staff attributed  to firstly Dr Macintosh, who in 2009 had inexplicably ceased the publication of all R&AB papers for nearly one year, and secondly to Lt General Graham who has taken a far less hands on approach with Defence Academy business than his predecessor Lieutenant General John Kiszely, who had been actively involved in many of ARAGs projects - instead creating a new 1 Star post (Army Brigadier Sean Crane) to help oversee the Academy's multimillion-pound business."]}, {"page": "List of Old Marlburians", "response": ["* John Kiszely, Lieutenant General and Director of the Defence Academy"]}, {"page": "Rognvald Herschell, 3rd Baron Herschell", "response": ["Lord Herschell married Lady Heather, daughter of Humphry Legge, 8th Earl of Dartmouth, in 1948.
