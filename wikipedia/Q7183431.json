He is thought to have been born in London in the 1730s, the son of a city merchant. He died in Kentish Town, London. He was married to Jane and they had six children, three of whom also became artists: George Dawe, Henry Edward Dawe and James Philip Dawe.\nHe was articled to Henry Morland  and godfather to his son George Morland. It is said that Dawe was the only person to maintain a strong friendship with George Morland through both the ups and downs of the latter's life.  Dawe's son, George, wrote a biography of Morland entitled The Life of George Morland with Remarks on His Works which was published in 1807.\nPhilip Dawe also worked for some time under William Hogarth. Although he worked as an artist in his own right, Dawe's output largely comprised engravings of the work of others.\nHe also produced satirical political cartoons leading up to the events of the Boston Tea Party and is referred to in a book entitled The Boston Port Bill as Pictured by a Contemporary London Cartoonist by R.T.H. Halsey. These cartoons include \"The Bostonians in Distress,\" \"The Alternative of Williams-Burg,\" and \"The Butcher\u2019s Wife Dressing for the Pantheon.\" They were of a simple style but made acute observation and comment. In 1774, he produced his most well known work, \"Bostonians Paying the Excise-Man, or Tarring and Feathering.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Miser", "response": ["A sub-theme of this kind of contrast occurred in Hans Holbein the Younger's \"The Miser and his Mistress\".
