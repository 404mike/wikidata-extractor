RELAX NG schemas may be written in either an XML based syntax or a more compact non-XML syntax; the two syntaxes are isomorphic and James Clark's conversion tool\u2014Trang\u2014can convert between them without loss of information. RELAX NG has a simpler definition and validation framework than XML Schema, making it easier to use and implement. It also has the ability to use datatype framework plug-ins; a RELAX NG schema author, for example, can require values in an XML document to conform to definitions in XML Schema Datatypes.", "XML was compiled by a working group of eleven members,The working group was originally called the \"Editorial Review Board.\" The original members and seven who were added before the first edition was complete, are listed at the end of the first edition of the XML Recommendation, at http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210. supported by a (roughly) 150-member Interest Group. Technical debate took place on the Interest Group mailing list and issues were resolved by consensus or, when that failed, majority vote of the Working Group. A record of design decisions and their rationales was compiled by Michael Sperberg-McQueen on December 4, 1997. James Clark served as Technical Lead of the Working Group, notably contributing the empty-element <empty\u00a0/> syntax and the name \"XML\". Other names that had been put forward for consideration included \"MAGMA\" (Minimal Architecture for Generalized Markup Applications), \"SLIM\" (Structured Language for Internet Markup) and \"MGML\" (Minimal Generalized Markup Language). The co-editors of the specification were originally Tim Bray and Michael Sperberg-McQueen. Halfway through the project Bray accepted a consulting engagement with Netscape, provoking vociferous protests from Microsoft. Bray was temporarily asked to resign the editorship. This led to intense dispute in the Working Group, eventually solved by the appointment of Microsoft's Jean Paoli as a third co-editor."]}, {"page": "James Clark", "response": ["* James Clark (lynching victim) (died 1926), accused of rape, lynched by a mob of white men", "* James Clark (criminal) (1902\u20131974), Depression-era bank robber known as \"Oklahoma Jack\"", "* James Clark (artist) (1858\u20131943), English painter", "* James Clark Jr. (1918\u20132006), Maryland State Senate president", "* James Clark (Kentucky politician) (1779\u20131839), Governor of Kentucky, 1836\u20131839", "* James Clark (Pennsylvania politician) (born 1952), Pennsylvania politician", "* James Clark (Minnesota politician) (born 1963), member of the Minnesota House of Representatives", "* James Clark (businessman) (1833\u20131898), mayor of Auckland, New Zealand", "* James Clark (Ontario politician) (1888\u20131952), Speaker of the Ontario Legislature, 1939\u20131943", "* James Clark (British diplomat) (born 1963), Ambassador to Luxembourg", "* James Clark (Dunedin mayor) (1870\u20131936), New Zealand politician", "* James Clark (Australian cricketer) (1871\u20131941), Australian cricketer", "* James Clark (New Zealand cricketer) (1910\u20132003), New Zealand cricketer", "* James Clark (American football) (1909\u2013?), American football player", "* James Clark (footballer, born 2001), English footballer", "* James Clark (sport shooter) (born 1936), American Olympic shooter", "* James Clark (shinty) (born 1973), shinty player from Invergarry, Scotland", "* James Clark (water polo) (born 1991), Australian water polo goalkeeper", "* James Clark (athlete), marathon runner", "* James Clark (physician in Dominica) (1737\u20131819), Scottish doctor and plantation owner", "* Sir James Clark, 1st Baronet (1788\u20131870), royal physician to Queen Victoria", "* James Clark (college president) (1812\u20131892), president of Washington College", "* A.
