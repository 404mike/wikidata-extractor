Creating categories promotes organization instead of chaos.  Jane Feuer has divided ways to categorize genres into three different groups.  The first is aesthetic.  By using this method one can organize according to certain sets of characteristics, and so the overall work of the artist is not disparaged by generalization.  The second classification method is ritual.  Ritual uses its own culture to help classify.  If one performs a ritual associated with a system of ritual, one can be said to be practicing as a member of that system.  The common taxonomic method is ideological.  This occurs most often in the marketing of texts, music, and movies.  The effectiveness of this type of categorization can be measured by how well the public accepts these categories as valid.", "* An Introduction to Genre Theory by Daniel Chandler"]}, {"page": "Commutation test", "response": ["According to Daniel Chandler, the commutation test may involve any of four basic transformations which, to a greater or lesser extent, involve modification of the syntagm:"]}, {"page": "Encoding (semiotics)", "response": ["Early theorists like Saussure (1857\u20131913) proposed the theory that when the addresser wishes to transmit a message to an addressee, the intended meaning must be converted into content so that it can be delivered. Roman Jakobson (1896\u20131982) offered a structuralist theory that the transmission and response would not sustain an efficient discourse unless the parties used the same codes in the appropriate social contexts. But, Barthes shifted the emphasis from the semiotics of language to the exploration of semiotics as language. Now, as Daniel Chandler states, there is no such thing as an uncoded message: all experience is coded. So when the addresser is planning the particular message, both denotative and connotative meanings will already be attached to the range of signifiers relevant to the message. Within the broad framework of syntactic and semantic codes, the addresser will select signifiers that, in the particular context, will best represent his or her values and purposes. But the medium of communication is not necessarily neutral and the ability of the addressee to accurately decode the message may be affected by a number of factors. So the addresser must attempt to compensate for the known problems when constructing the final version of the message and hope that the preferred meanings will be identified when the message is received. One of the techniques is to structure the message so that certain aspects are given salience (sometimes called foregrounding) and predispose the audience to interpret the whole in the light of the particular. This relates to Gestalt psychology, Max Wertheimer (1880\u20131943) examined the factors that determine grouping in cognitive processes:"]}, {"page": "Technological somnambulism", "response": ["* Daniel Chandler's inevitability thesis"]}, {"page": "Docufiction", "response": ["Docufiction (or docu-fiction), often confused with docudrama, is the cinematographic combination of documentary and fiction, this term often meaning narrative film.

The Constructionist View can also be defined as, how you say something determines what the message is.  The Constructionist View assumes that \"truth\" and \"ideas\" are constructed or invented through the social process of communication.  Robert T. Craig saw the Constructionist View or the constitutive view as it's called in his article, as \"\u2026an ongoing process that symbolically forms and re-forms our personal identities.\" (Craig, 125).  The other view of communication, the Transmission Model, sees communication as robotic and computer-like.  The Transmission Model sees communication as a way of sending or receiving messages and the perfection of that.  But, the Constructionist View sees communications as, \"\u2026in human life, info does not behave as simply as bits in an electronic stream.  In human life, information flow is far more like an electric current running from one landmine to another\" (Lanham, 7).  The Constructionist View is a more realistic view of communication  because it involves the interacting of human beings and the free sharing of thoughts and ideas.  Daniel Chandler looks to prove that the Transmission Model is a lesser way of communicating by saying \"The transmission model is not merely a gross over-simplification but a dangerously misleading representation of the nature of human communication\" (Chandler, 2).  Humans do not communicate simply as computers or robots so that's why it's essential to truly understand the Constructionist View of Communication well.  We do not simply send facts and data to one another, but we take facts and data and they acquire meaning through the process of communication, or through interaction with others."]}, {"page": "Semiotics of music videos", "response": ["Invisible editing (a semiotic term) refers to what film editors use to almost decode a song's message for the audience through narrative actions.
