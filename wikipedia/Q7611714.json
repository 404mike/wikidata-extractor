The local Chetnik leaders, Bajo Stani\u0161i\u0107 and Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, had reached arrangements with the Italians and were cooperating with them against the communist-led Partisans. Mihailovi\u0107 later claimed at his trial in 1946 that he was unaware of these arrangements prior to his arrival in Montenegro, and had to accept them once he arrived, as Stani\u0161i\u0107 and \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 acknowledged him as their leader in name only and would only follow Mihailovi\u0107's orders if they supported their interests. Mihailovi\u0107 believed that Italian military intelligence was better informed than he was of the activities of his commanders. He tried to make the best of the situation and accepted the appointment of Bla\u017eo \u0110ukanovi\u0107 as the figurehead commander of \"nationalist forces\" in Montenegro. While Mihailovi\u0107 approved the destruction of communist forces, he aimed to exploit the connections of Chetniks commanders with the Italians to get food, arms and ammunition in the expectation of an Allied landing in the Balkans. On 1 December, \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 organised a Chetnik \"youth conference\" at \u0160ahovi\u0107i. The congress, which historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch writes expressed \"extremism and intolerance\", nationalist claims were made on parts of Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Italy, while its resolutions posited the restoration of a monarchy with a period of transitional Chetnik dictatorship. Mihailovi\u0107 and \u0110ukanovi\u0107 did not attend the event, which was entirely dominated by \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, but they sent representatives. In the same month, Mihailovi\u0107 informed his subordinates that: \"The units of the Partisans are filled with thugs of the most varied kinds, such as Usta\u0161as\u00a0\u2013 the worst butchers of the Serb people\u00a0\u2013 Jews, Croats, Dalmatians, Bulgarians, Turks, Magyars, and all the other nations of the world.\"", "The British were more and more concerned about the fact that the Chetniks were more willing to fight Partisans than Axis troops. At the third Moscow Conference in October 1943, Anthony Eden expressed impatience about Mihailovi\u0107's lack of action. The report of Fitzroy Maclean, liaison officer to the Partisans, convinced Churchill that Tito's forces were the most reliable resistance group. The report of Charles Armstrong, liaison officer to Mihailovi\u0107, arrived too late for Anthony Eden to take it to the Tehran Conference in late November 1943, though Stevan K. Pavlowitch thinks that it would probably been insufficient to change Churchill's mind. At Tehran, Churchill argued in favour of the Partisans, while Joseph Stalin expressed limited interest but agreed that they should receive the greatest possible support."]}, {"page": "Noel Malcolm", "response": ["Malcolm's book Kosovo: A Short History (1998) was the subject of an extended debate in Foreign Affairs. The debate began with a review of the book by Aleksa Djilas, a former Fellow of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, who wrote that the book was \"marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans\". Malcolm responded that Djilas had not produced any evidence to counter the evidence in the book, and had instead resorted to belittling both Malcolm and his work, including the use of personal slurs and patronising language. The debate continued with Serbian-born Professor Stevan K. Pavlowitch of the University of Southampton asserting that Malcolm's book lacked precision, Melanie McDonagh of the Bosnian Institute claiming that Djilas's review took a \"nationalistic approach\", and Norman Cigar of Marine Corps University stating that Djilas was trying to create myths to legitimise Serbian actions in Kosovo.Noel Malcolm, Aleksa Djilas, et al. \"Is Kosovo Real?
