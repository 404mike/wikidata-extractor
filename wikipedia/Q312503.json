Lubbock worked in his family company as a banker but made significant contributions in archaeology, ethnography, and several branches of biology. He coined the terms \"Paleolithic\" and \"Neolithic\" to denote the Old and New Stone Ages, respectively. He helped establish archaeology as a scientific discipline, and was influential in debates concerning evolutionary theory. He introduced the first law for the protection of the UK's archaeological and architectural heritage. He was also a founding member of the X Club.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Three-age system", "response": ["It was to be a full generation before British archaeology caught up with the Danish. When it did, the leading figure was another multi-talented man of independent means: John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. After reviewing the Three-age System from Lucretius to Thomsen, Lubbock improved it and took it to another level, that of cultural anthropology. Thomsen had been concerned with techniques of archaeological classification. Lubbock found correlations with the customs of savages and civilization."]}, {"page": "1913", "response": ["* May 28 \u2013 John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury, British politician and scientist (b. 1839)"]}, {"page": "Metaphysical Society", "response": ["*John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury"]}]}}
