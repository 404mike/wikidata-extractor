Despite this, however, there were occasions when the teams fixtures clashed and this led to some players having to choose which team to play for. In April 1931 both Tom Farquharson and Peter Kavanagh chose to play for the FAI XI against Spain instead of playing for the IFA XI  against Wales. In November 1937 the roles were reversed when Tommy Breen chose to play for the IFA XI in a 1938 British Home Championship game against Scotland on 10 November instead of playing for the FAI XI in a 1938 World Cup qualifier against Norway on 7 November. In 1938 Bill Hayes found himself in a similar position. He was called up by the FAI XI to play against Poland on 13 November.
