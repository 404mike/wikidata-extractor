However despite the \"success\" of 30 March action the INLA was facing internal turmoil. IRSP chairperson Miriam Daly threatened to resign over policy disagreements and perceived failings of the IRSP to raise funds, run in elections, and enact policy. Senior IRSP member Michael Plunkett was arrested after Gardai found bomb-making equipment in his flat in Dublin and later jumped bail and fled to Paris. A series of botched Middle East arms importations attempts precipitated tensions between Belfast and Dublin representatives to the INLA GHQ and Dessie Grew considered assassinating the leader of the Belfast faction opposed to the INLA chief of staff. Before the conflict broke out there were attempts to recruit veteran Provisional IRA leader Se\u00e1n Mac St\u00edof\u00e1in as INLA chief of staff in the hope he would help stabilise the organisation. He was interested and met with INLA Army Council representatives on several occasions between 1978 and 1979 but nothing materialised. The unauthorised kidnapping of a Dublin bank manager from his home in January 1980 led to further internal anger and an operation in England was planned to demonstrate that the INLA was still capable of carrying on its war. An INLA Active service unit planted two 10 lb bombs at Netheravon British Army camp in Salisbury Plain. Although only one bomb detonated & caused damage starting a fire, injuring two soldiers, this action helped bind the organisation together.", "The INLA lost another of its founding leadership in 1980, when Ronnie Bunting was assassinated at his home.Deadly Divisions, p. 160 Noel Little, another Protestant member of the INLA, was killed in the same incident. The Ulster Defence Association, an Ulster loyalist paramilitary, claimed responsibility for both killings. Another leading INLA member, Miriam Daly, was killed by loyalist assassins in the same year. Although no group claimed responsibility, the INLA claimed that the Special Air Service (SAS) was involved in the killings of Bunting and Little."]}, {"page": "Irish Republican Socialist Party", "response": ["Following meetings between the INLA and OIRA leadership in Dublin, a truce was eventually reached, but in one of the first of the INLA's armed operations, Billy McMillen, commanding officer of the OIRA Belfast Battalion, was murdered by Gerard Steenson.

In late 1979, John McMichael, a leading figure in the UDA and also a Lisburn native, set up a commando structure within the UDA and drew up a \"shopping list\" of leading targets for this group to kill.H. McDonald & J. Cusack, UDA \u2013 Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Dublin, Penguin Ireland, 2004, pp. 116\u2013118 Amongst the names on the list killed were Irish Independence Party member John Turnley, Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners' representative Miriam Daly and INLA and Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) activists Ronnie Bunting and Noel Lyttle. On 14 January 1981, Smallwoods, an associate of McMichael, was amongst those in attendance at a meeting above McMichael's pub in which it was decided that the next target would be former Irish republican politician Bernadette McAliskey. According to Sammy Duddy, Smallwoods was one of only nine men that McMichael used for these operations.Ian S. Wood, Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, Edinburgh University Press, 2006, p. 119 Smallwoods and McMichael were close personally as well as professionally and both men and their families holidayed together on the Isle of Man.Gary McMichael, Ulster Voice: In Search of Common Ground in Northern Ireland, Niwot Colorado: Roberts Rinehart, 1999, pp. 56\u201357"]}, {"page": "John McMichael", "response": ["By 1979 he had emerged as the leading figure within the UDA and the organisation's most charismatic senior member. According to the Belfast Telegraph, he drew up a 'shopping list' of targets (mostly members of Sinn F\u00e9in and other republican groups) that he felt the UDA should eliminate. Information about the individuals had been supplied to the UDA by individuals within the security forces who leaked the information.McDonald & Cusack, p. 116 McMichael hand-picked his own squad for this task and throughout 1980 a number of the targets were assassinated.\"The UDA's killer wing: murder goes by any name\". Belfast Telegraph. 12 November 2007 Retrieved 16 March 2011 The new commando unit, which was known internally in the UDA as the Ulster Defence Force, carried out four murders in 1979, three of which were from the \"shopping list\". McMichael then turned his attention to members of the Relatives' Action Committee and on his orders Irish Independence Party leader John Turnley and Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) activist Miriam Daly, both prominent within this republican prisoners' rights group, were killed. Rodney McCormick, a less prominent IRSP member, was killed in Larne soon afterwards before McMichael's team struck again, killing Irish republican Ronnie Bunting and his friend Noel Lyttle at Bunting's Turf Lodge home on 15 October 1980.McDonald & Cusack, p. 117"]}]}}
