From nearly 40 years of observations, White recognised that birds and animals have inner lives. He based his work on accurate (if haphazard) recording of events, classifying, measuring, analysing data, making deductions from observations, and experimenting.Farrington 2019, p.20  He was \u2018one of the first writers to show that it was possible to write of the natural world with a fresh and intensely personal vision without in any way sacrificing precision\u2019.Mabey, Richard, Gilbert White: A Biography of the Author of The Natural History of Selborne. Century Hutchinson, 1986 (Profile Books edn, 2006), p.188 Thus, Richard Mabey quotes White: \u2018during this lovely weather the congregating flocks of house martins on the Church and tower were very beautiful and very amusing!  When they flew off all together from the roof, on any alarm, they quite swarmed in the air.  But they soon settled again in heaps on the shingles; where preening their feathers to admit the rays of the sun, they seemed highly to enjoy the warm situation.\u2019Mabey 2006 edn, p.211, quoting a letter (December 19, 1791) from White to Robert Marsham. White's scientific outlook was coloured by his theology. He did not have grand theories, plan experiments and replicate them as a modern scientist would: he was more freewheeling and, arguably, as a consequence more appealing as a writer.Farrington 2019, p.20", "White's biographer, Richard Mabey, praises White's expressiveness:"]}, {"page": "Berkhamsted School", "response": ["*Richard Mabey (born 1941), nature writer"]}, {"page": "Tomorrow's World", "response": ["*Richard Mabey (1995)"]}, {"page": "Chris Mead", "response": ["To raise funds for the BTO's nightingale research, Mead devised a CD of poetry, and nightingale song (including several historic archive recordings) Nightingales: A Celebration with an accompanying book by Richard Mabey."]}, {"page": "Thomas Pennant", "response": ["The naturalist Richard Mabey wrote that Pennant was \"a doughty and open-minded traveller, and his various Tours were best-sellers in their time\",Mabey, 1986. pp. 106\u2013107 adding Samuel Johnson's comment that Pennant was \"the best traveller I ever read\".
