Her eyes were terror-stricken and she was nervous of my answer.\"Helm 92015), page 489 Despite Salvesen's warning, Lefort and two other English prisoners, Mary O'Shaughnessy and Mary Young went to the camp. Another British inmate nurse, Mary Lindell De Moncy, told Atkins that she had sent recall messages to the three Englishwomen to return to the main camp, but while O'Shaughnessy did so, Lefort refused to leave Young, who was in a very bad condition.Sloan, page 205Escott (2010), page 106 According to O'Shaughnessy, sometime in February 1945, Lefort's name was called out from a selection list during a morning roll, and she was taken away and gassed. After the war, Dr. Lefort, Atkins and civil and legal authorities questioned several witnesses in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a precise date for Lefort's death.Sloan, pages 199\u2013231 Consequently, Lloyd's of London, the official executor of Lefort's will, accepted the date of 1 May 1945 for \"official purposes as the date of her presumed death.\"Sloan, pages 232\u2013233"]}, {"page": "Mary Young", "response": ["Mary Young, Marie Young or Maria Young may refer to:", "*Polly Young (1749\u20131799), also known as Mary Young and Maria Young, English classical soprano", "*Mary Young (politician), member of the Colorado House of Representatives", "*Mary Young Pickersgill (1776\u20131857, born Mary Young), American flagmaker", "*Maria Young Dougall (1849\u20131935, born Mary Young), American suffragist", "*Mary Young (actress) (1879\u20131971), stage and film actress", "*Jenny Diver, n\u00e9e Mary Young, a notorious British pickpocket"]}]}}
