The following season United took the First Division by storm. Led by such players as Tony Currie, Alan Woodward, Eddie Colquhoun, Len Badger, Ted Hemsley, Trevor Hockey, Alan Hodgkinson, Gil Reece and Bill Dearden they played the first ten games without defeat, recording eight victories and two draws. With one League Cup victory during this period, United had an unbeaten run of 22 matches. They finally lost the top spot in Division One in a memorable encounter with Manchester United at Old Trafford on 2 October 1971, The Blades losing out 2\u20130 on that occasion. The memorable goal scored by George Best six minutes from the end is still replayed on television to this day."]}, {"page": "Len Badger", "response": ["Badger made his league debut for the Blades first team against Leyton Orient at Bramall Lane on 26 April 1963.  By the end of the 1963\u201364 season he established himself as first choice at right-back, replacing club stalwart Cec Coldwell and remained a regular there until 1975. He was appointed captain in 1968 by manager John Harris. This made him the youngest league captain in United history, and one of the youngest skippers in the league at the time. He served as captain for two years before relinquishing the role to Eddie Colquhoun. Badger's left-back colleagues of the early and mid-sixties included Graham Shaw and Bernard Shaw, but it was the arrival of Ted Hemsley in 1968 that provided him with his most fruitful partnership which continued through one of United's most successful post war periods from 1969\u20131972."]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Ted Hemsley"]}]}}
