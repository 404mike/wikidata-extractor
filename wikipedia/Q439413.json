Graham Chapman, of Monty Python fame, lived (around 1951/52) in what was then Wigston police station, (the building on the corner of Pullman Road \u2013 opposite the swimming baths) during the time that his father was the inspector there. He attended South Wigston Junior School. Author and journalist John Marquis was born in Wigston and educated at Abington and Guthlaxton schools. The Leicester City footballer Howard Riley was also Wigston born and bred. Composer and piano virtuoso Michael Garrett was educated at Guthlaxton school. The music hall star Gertie Gitana is buried in Wigston cemetery, having been married for many years to local theatrical impresario Don Ross, who was born in the town. She died in the 1950s, having been a showbiz celebrity in the early years of the 20th century. Another Guthlaxton pupil was prominent policeman Geoffrey Barrett, who received a Governor's commendation as a member of the Hong Kong anti-corruption squad in the 1970s and ended his career as head of the Leicester murder squad."]}, {"page": "Austin Healey", "response": ["In the 05/06 season, Healey was handed club vice-captaincy and regularly captained the team from scrum half and fly half during the international period. He looked back to near his best form and pressed both Harry Ellis and Andy Goode out of their respective regular slots of 9 and 10 at different times throughout the season. Leicester made the premiership final again and were beaten by Sale Sharks, Healey claims to have thrown his silver medal away in disgust at the end of the game, claiming that he didn't do 'losers medals'."]}, {"page": "Tim Stimpson", "response": ["A year later, in the 2002 Heineken Cup semi-final against Llanelli. With only a few minutes remaining, the score was 10\u201312 to Llanelli, Stimpson having kicked a penalty and converted Harry Ellis's try, Stephen Jones having kicked four penalties for the Scarlets. In windy conditions, Tigers were awarded a penalty at a scrum inside their own half, and Stimpson elected to go for goal from 60m out. The ball hit one of the posts and the crossbar, before going over to give the Tigers a 13\u201312 lead which they held onto to gain the victory. Tigers went on to win the final against Munster, Stimpson kicking a penalty and a conversion."]}, {"page": "Matt Dawson", "response": ["Dawson returned to the England fold in 2005 but had limited opportunities in a disappointing Six Nations campaign as Harry Ellis started at number nine for four of the five matches."]}, {"page": "Ellis", "response": ["* Harry Ellis (born 1982), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "May 1982", "response": ["**Harry Ellis, English rugby union player; in Wigston, Leicestershire, England"]}, {"page": "Leicester Grammar School", "response": ["* Harry Ellis, a former rugby player for the Leicester Tigers and England."]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Premiership Rugby", "response": ["|SH ||9 || Harry Ellis||"]}, {"page": "2007 Six Nations Championship", "response": ["|SH ||9||Harry Ellis", "|SH ||9||Harry Ellis"]}, {"page": "Loughborough College", "response": ["* Harry Ellis \u2013 rugby union"]}, {"page": "Shaun Perry", "response": ["Perry made another appearance for England on 24 February against Ireland in the 2007 Six Nations match at Croke Park.

However, having lost a stone in preparation for fighting for a World Cup place, his next game for England was a Man-of-the-Match performance against Wales in a World Cup warm-up match at Twickenham on 4 August 2007.
