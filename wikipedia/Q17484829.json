Ady protested her wrongful termination causing all the tutors and several council members to resign, as well as resulting in boycotts by tutors at other Oxford affiliated schools. The ensuing situation was widely reported in the press and an investigation, initially welcomed by Jourdain, was undertaken. When it became evident that she would be asked to resign, Jourdain suffered a heart attack and died on 6 April 1924. She was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford."]}, {"page": "William Cornwallis Cartwright", "response": ["Cartwright married Clementine Gaul from Germany.
