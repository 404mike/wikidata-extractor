In the 1890s she was a leading principal boy in London's most lavishly staged pantomimes. In the 20th century her career changed to playing comic, formidable older women. Her most celebrated role of this kind was in the hit musical The Arcadians (1909), staged by her brother-in-law Robert Courtneidge.\nBeyond musical comedy, Blanche appeared in farces and other comedies in non-singing roles between 1906 and her retirement in 1921. Among her co-stars during her long career were George Grossmith Jr., Dan Leno, Marie Lloyd, Walter Passmore, Kate Santley and Little Tich.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cicely Courtneidge", "response": ["Courtneidge, the elder daughter and second of three children, was born in Sydney to a theatrical family,Green, Stanley. \"Cicely Courtneidge\".
