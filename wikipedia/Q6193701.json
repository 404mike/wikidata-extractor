They made their name with a distinctive style of power pop, fusing samples, sequenced basses and drum machines with rock 'n' roll guitars and off-beat wordplay-loaded lyrics.  They reached the height of their fame in 1992. Over the following years the band took on new members, reaching a six-piece, but struggled to regain their earlier popularity. They initially split up in 1998 after releasing seven albums.", "In 1991 \u2013 having signed to Rough Trade Records \u2013 Carter USM released the album 30 Something which, thanks to non-stop touring, entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight. One of the singles released from the album, \"Bloodsport For All\", an attack on racism and bullying in the army, was released at the start of the Gulf War and consequently banned by the BBC. Spurred on by infamy, Jim Bob and Fruitbat toured Japan, Yugoslavia and the United States (with EMF) and made a second-on-the-bill appearance at the Reading Festival. The band also made its first Top of the Pops appearance with the single \"After the Watershed (Early Learning The Hard Way)\", a song about child abuse that would become more famous for its subsequent legal battle with The Rolling Stones' publisher over the use of the lyrics \"Goodbye Ruby Tuesday\" in the chorus. The band also hit the headlines when Fruitbat rugby tackled the children's TV presenter Phillip Schofield in front of millions of television viewers at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party in 1991.", "Les Carter currently lives in Folkestone and plays with the band Abdoujaparov and was announced on 27 November 2014 as the new guitarist for Ferocious Dog.

James Morrison's projects included the band Jim's Super Stereoworld before moving on to solo albums including Angelstrike! He has also written four books: Goodnight, Jim Bob, detailing his experiences on the road with Carter USM; and three novels \u2013 Storage Stories, Driving Jarvis Ham, The Extra Ordinary Life of Frank Derrick, Age 81, and Frank Derrick's Holiday of a Lifetime.

The pair's two bands, Jim's Super Stereoworld and Abdoujaparov, would play a set each, after which the pair combined to perform a number of Carter USM songs. On 4 March 2007, almost ten years after the band last performed, Carter USM's original two-man line-up played a set of four songs as part of a gig to celebrate the life of Darren 'Wiz' Brown, former frontman of the Mega City Four, who had died in December 2006. The band had been booked to play acoustically but surprised the audience by playing a traditional electric set at the last moment.", "Due to the success of this performance, Carter reunited for two 'farewell' gigs later that year. The first show took place on 2 November 2007 at London's Brixton Academy with support from Sultans of Ping. Another concert was later arranged, which took place at Glasgow Barrowlands on 20 October 2007. This was recorded for the \"Back in Bed With Carter\" DVD that contained the whole concert, along with an interview and rehearsal footage. Support at The Barrowlands came from The Frank and Walters and Chris T-T. The reunion celebrated twenty years since the band's foundation and ten years since their split. The gigs were performed as the original two-piece of Fruitbat and Jim Bob.", "To coincide with the reunion EMI released a two-CD anthology, You Fat Bastard, compiled by Jim Bob and Fruitbat. The songs were digitally remastered at Abbey Road studios. This was released in conjunction with the majority of their back catalogue (albums and promo videos) being made available digitally for the first time by EMI.", "On 6 February 2008, Jim Bob and Fruitbat hinted at the possibility of further Carter USM gigs when they sent an email to members of the band's mailing list. Two dates were then announced for Birmingham Academy and Brixton Academy for 21 and 22 November 2008. Support came from EMF at both gigs. Two further sell out gigs followed in London in November 2009, titled \"The Drum Machine Years\".

There are numerous other musical styles explored on the album besides the band's usual drum machine-based punk rock, and some of Jim Bob's lyrics had started to become more personal, sitting alongside tracks which are more traditionally politically or socially based. The album was a critical success, with critics complimenting the new approaches that the band had undertaken. In their lists of the top 50 albums of the year, NME named it 22nd whilst Select named it 46th. The band played the entire album live for the first time in Kentish Town in November 2009.", "For the follow-up album, which the duo named Post Historic Monsters, the band felt a change in approach was necessary. Although singer Jim Bob felt the negative comments at the time of the release of \"The Impossible Dream\" were \"completely pointless,\" he nonetheless conceded that the duo's output up until that point was \"really easy to parody.\" He felt that \"parts of 1992 could have been made by Bobby Davro. It was up for that kind of a bashing.\" The duo felt it was not only critics but also fans who had grown tired of the duo, and their label who Bob felt lacked the \"over-the-top enthusiasm\" they bore when the duo signed with them. The duo had also grown tired of writing and playing music, and held off releasing any material for almost a year. Bob said: \"We knew we had to come up with a good album or that would have been the end of it.\" Fruitbat of the duo said that, with Post Historic Monsters, \"we knew we had something to prove. We didn't want anybody to be allowed to dismiss us. No fucking way!\"", "Keen to \"prove themselves\" with Post Historic Monsters, the album is a musical and lyrical departure from previous records by the band. According to Deadline magazine, it shows the band \"moving into previously uncharted musical and lyrical territories,\" and made note of the excess of surprises on the album. The album is darker and \"more fed-up\" than the band's previous albums, with a directness and bitterness that contrasts with the \"more overtly tongue in cheek\" style of previous albums such as 101 Damnations or 1992: The Love Album. In an interview with Deadline magazine, Jim Bob said \"the difference between Post Historic Monsters and the records we have put out since 101 Damnations is that you can listen to it without prejudice. There's none of that stuff that usually puts people off. It's like it doesn't matter that it's a Carter record. It could almost be by anyone.\"", "The controversial \"Commercial Fucking Suicide Part 1\" was omitted from UK editions but added to American editions as a bonus track.
