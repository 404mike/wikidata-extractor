But whilst he referred to the earlier school of watercolourists his works are all his own and were created as much as reaction to French Impressionism but with a peculiarly English slant.  As Rich and a number of his contemporaries pointed out (including Roger Fry and Lawrence Binyon) it was arguably the English watercolour tradition of painting quickly En plein air that had inspired much of the Impressionism's original spontaneity and it was an area where the English artistic tradition could claim to have been innovative. Rich was an advocate of a natural approach to painting, trying to capture the emotions which a subject provoked, rather than accurately reproducing a scene. He had little feeling towards what he termed \"exhibition pieces\", which he viewed as being overworked.  He was critical towards even some of the greatest masters who he believed were often guilty of marring their work by polishing over the traces of their original responses to a scene. He also disliked \"pretty pictures\", a term which he used to refer to the quaint works produced by some of his contemporaries and used this term as a thinly veiled criticism of the work of Helen Allingham."]}, {"page": "Birmingham School of Art", "response": ["* Helen Allingham, watercolour painter"]}, {"page": "Craigenputtock", "response": ["File:Rear view of Craigenputtock in 1891.png|Watercolor by Helen Allingham of the rear view of Craigenputtock in 1891"]}, {"page": "1902 in art", "response": ["* Helen Allingham \u2013 View of Blackdown"]}, {"page": "1848 in art", "response": ["*September 26 \u2013 Helen Allingham, English painter and illustrator (died 1926)"]}, {"page": "Blackdown, West Sussex", "response": ["thumbnail|right|100px|Aldworth, painted by Helen AllinghamAside from its elevation and beauty, Blackdown is best known as the site of the poet Tennyson houses, Aldworth and Foxholes.
