Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe on 3 September 1939 Burbridge registered himself as a conscientious objector but changed his mind in 1940 and enlisted in the RAF.\nBurbridge completed his training within a year and was posted to No. 85 Squadron RAF and claimed only one probable claim against enemy aircraft with a further aircraft damaged by the end of 1942. Burbridge was then posted to an Operational Training Unit (OTU) as an instructor before spending a year as a staff officer. In July 1943 he had reached the rank of flight lieutenant.\nBurbridge returned to operations in late 1943 with No. 85 Squadron, now equipped with the de Havilland Mosquito. The unit performed night defence operations over the British Isles. Burbridge was assigned radar operator Bill Skelton who flew with him. Burbridge achieved success in a relatively short time period. By the end of the German air offensive Steinbock in May 1944 he had shot down five enemy aircraft making him a night fighter ace. Both men were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) in May 1944.\nIn June 1944 Operation Overlord and the Allied invasion of German-occupied Europe began reopening the Western Front. Burbridge flew a number of sorties as an intruder pilot with No. 100 Group RAF over the front. He achieved a further two aerial victories with one probable and another damaged in combat in these operations. Burbridge also destroyed three V-1 flying bombs over southern England.\nIn September 1944 No. 85 Squadron returned to intruding over Germany and supporting RAF Bomber Command. Burbridge was awarded a bar to his DFC in October 1944 and a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) the following month. From September 1944 to January 1945, Burbridge claimed 13 enemy night fighter aircraft destroyed\u2014including four in one night. In February 1945 both men were awarded a bar to their DSO.\nAfter the end of hostilities in May 1945, Burbridge stayed in the RAF for a further seven months before resigning his commission. After the war he studied at Oxford University and then Cambridge University before entering the Christian ministry. He remained in its service until his retirement. Burbridge resided in Chorleywood up until his death in November 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "De Havilland Mosquito", "response": ["The Mosquito also proved a very capable night fighter.

In the case of Cunningham and Burbridge, this may have stemmed from deeper religious convictions about combat and killing. Burbridge became a priest during the war and neither he nor Cunningham cooperated with biographers when approached to have their exploits described in print after the war. During the war, Braham also shunned the lime-light. The Daily Express, asked to interview him but he declined. Much to Braham's embarrassment, his father gave interviews about his famous son in 1943. When no stories were forthcoming, the newspapers soon lost interest. Braham and Cunningham were certainly aware of each other as a result of the press attention and a competitive rivalry developed. In his book Scramble, Braham mentioned with pride the night he surpassed Cunningham's score permanently."]}, {"page": "John Braham (RAF officer)", "response": ["Braham was the most highly decorated airman in RAF Fighter Command.

A notable success was recorded by Wing Commander Edward Crew who accounted for a Me 410 of 1 Staffel KG 51. Branse Burbridge of 85 Squadron also brought down an enemy aircraft.", "By April 1944 the preparations for Overlord were well underway. The Luftwaffe had not been able to observe and counter the Allied buildup. RAF Fighter Command masked the invasion ports from the German reconnaissance units by day. The Germans resorted to using 1./Aufklarungsgruppe 121 (Long Range Reconnaissance Group 121), equipped with Me 410s, to fly from bases near Paris and observe the results of raids by night. These operations failed. Nevertheless, 1./Aufklarungsgruppe 122 (Long Range Reconnaissance Group 121) was ordered to support and record the damage of four consecutive night raids on Portsmouth which began on 25/26 April. The raids also failed, even against a coastal target which was easier to find. The reconnaissance groups lost two Me 410s\u2014one of which fell to Branse Burbridge from 85 Squadron. Other losses were an Fw 190G-3 from 3./SKG 10, two Ju 88s from KG 2, a Ju 88 from the pathfinder I./KG 66 unit, a He 177 from 3./KG 100 plus two Me 410s from 1(F)/121.
