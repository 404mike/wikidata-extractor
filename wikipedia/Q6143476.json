Stafford's batting and bowling styles are unknown. He was born at Godalming, Surrey.\nStafford made a single first-class appearance for Surrey against Yorkshire in 1864 at Brammall Lane, Sheffield. Surrey won the toss and elected to bat first, making 195 all out, with Stafford the last man out in the innings, dismissed for a duck by Luke Greenwood. Yorkshire were then dismissed for 236 in their first-innings, during which Stafford bowled twelve wicketless overs, which conceded 31 runs. In response, Surrey made 247 all out in their second-innings, with Stafford once again the last man out when he was dismissed for a duck by Roger Iddison.

His father was the owner of a furniture store, which had been opened by his grandfather (an Irish immigrant) in 1902. He was raised in Irvington, a Catholic community in Southwest Baltimore, and graduated from Loyola High School in 1950. He then entered Loyola College in Baltimore with the intent of pursuing a career in medicine. However, in 1952, the death of a close friend in a car crash caused him to rethink his future and to enter St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore."]}]}}
