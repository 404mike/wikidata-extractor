The first leg was played at Aggborough on 10 March 2007, with the home side securing a 2\u20130 lead to take into the second leg. Gavin Hurren scored the opening goal of the match after Mark Creighton's powerful effort was palmed into Hurren's path. Shortly before the interval, Kidderminster doubled their advantage when James Constable prodded home Alex Russell's through pass, ensuring Kidderminster took a two-goal advantage ahead of their trip to Northwich's Victoria Stadium. In the second leg, played a week later, on 17 March, Northwich made light work of their two-goal deficit by scoring two goals in the opening fifteen minutes to tie the game at 2\u20132. However, goals from Mark Creighton and Russell Penn ensured Kidderminster regained their two-goal aggregate advantage. A late Michael Carr penalty ensured Northwich won the game 3\u20132, but lost the tie 4\u20133 on aggregate, meaning Kidderminster had earned a place in the final."]}]}}
