Kandel went on to note Crick and Koch's suggestion that once the binding problem\u2014understanding what accounts for the unity of experience\u2014is solved, it will be possible to solve the hard problem empirically. However, neuroscientist Anil Seth argued that emphasis on the so-called hard problem is a distraction from what he calls the \"real problem\": understanding the neurobiology underlying consciousness, namely the neural correlates of various conscious processes. This more modest goal is the focus of most scientists working on consciousness. Psychologist Susan Blackmore believes, by contrast, that the search for the neural correlates of consciousness is futile and itself predicated on an erroneous belief in the hard problem of consciousness."]}, {"page": "User illusion", "response": ["*Anil Seth, who espouses a similar notion of experienced reality as a hallucination"]}, {"page": "TED (conference)", "response": ["|Anil Seth explores the mystery of consciousness"]}, {"page": "List of cognitive scientists", "response": ["* Anil Seth"]}]}}
