In late March/early April 1922, St Andrew's Colonial Home played host to the first Mount Everest expedition. There had been a reconnaissance expedition the previous year, but the 1922 expedition was the first attempt to conquer the summit. The main team members were General Charles Granville Bruce, Edward Lisle Strutt, George Mallory, George Ingle Finch, Edward Felix Norton, Henry Treise Morshead, Howard Somervell, Arthur Wakefield, and the photographer and movie maker John Noel. Making up the rest of the team was a large group of Tibetan and Nepalese Sherpa's and porters who tendered the pace of donkey's laden with food and equipment. The party arrived by steam train at Kalimpong Road Station from where they trekked the short distance up the hillside to St Andrew's Colonial Home for three days relaxation. There was much excitement among the staff and children at St Andrew's, with football games, golf, and group evening sing-alongs taking place in the main school hall, with members of the expedition partaking in the activities. Aeneas, his wife Clara, and their two 6-year-old children were at the centre of the hospitality, with Wolseley House (among other houses in the school compound) providing temporary accommodation for the lead mountaineers.National Library of Scotland, Level 15 Special Archives, Kalimpong Papers: Files ACC 6039, Box 15 (1) \u2018Everest Climbers\u2019 1922, pages 37\u201340, documents the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition visit to St Andrew's Colonial Home (within the hand-typed biography of St Andrew's Colonial Home).

They arrived at Rongbuk Glacier base camp on May 1. Alas, the expedition's attempt to ascent Everest turned out to be unsuccessful. John Noel produced a movie of the expedition titled Climbing Mount Everest (1922).Climbing Mount Everest (1922) \u2013 Directed by John Noel \u2013 housed at the British Film Institute: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-climbing-mt-everest-1922-online The film shows the team arriving on a steam train at Kalimpong Road Station and at St. Andrew's Colonial Home, although footage taken inside the school compound is not included in the movie. The 1922 expedition did establish a new world record climbing height of 8,326 metres (27,320\u00a0ft). The team's next attempt to conquer Everest took place in 1924. It was during this expedition that George Mallory and his companion Andrew Irvine made an attempt to reach the summit together but, at some point, died in a fall. However, until this day, it is still unsure whether or not the pair did reach the summit. Mallory's body was only retrieved in 1999; Irvine's body has never been found."]}]}}
