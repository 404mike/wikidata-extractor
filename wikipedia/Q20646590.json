He made his first team debut on 5 December 1998 in a 2\u20131 FA Cup second round defeat at Wrexham as a 17-year-old while still a trainee. He was substituted at half-time for Graham Rennison to facilitate a tactical switch after Mark Tinkler was sent off in the first half. He signed a two-year professional contract at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, which he finished with the club's Young Player of the Year award. He made 17 starts during his first full season and played 25 games in total, but never managed more than six successive appearances. His season had been ended early because of an ankle injury he picked up in a reserve game, but he extended his contract during the summer to three years, keeping him at Bootham Crescent until at least 2003. His first goal came nearly two years after his debut when he scored a header in a 3\u20131 victory over Halifax Town at The Shay on 24 October 2000. He scored another three goals that season, including another goal against Halifax Town in a 2\u20131 relegation battle on 14 April 2001. In the 2001\u201302 season, he more than doubled the number of goals to nine. He underwent an ankle operation in April 2002, which ended his season early after playing 47 games. He scored seven the following season, but at the end of the season, he was one of just eight players to be kept on at the club, because of financial problems. Once again he scored seven goals in 2003\u201304."]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 York City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=row|Graham Rennison"]}, {"page": "Graham Lee Rennison", "response": ["#REDIRECT Graham Rennison"]}, {"page": "Rennison", "response": ["*Graham Rennison (born 1978), English footballer"]}]}}
