Even then, the amateurs realised they were at a real disadvantage and so their team in the inaugural match at Lord's included two of the greatest professional players, William Beldham and William Lambert as \"given men\". Lambert made 57 out of 195 and, given the support he received from T. A. Smith, who scored 48, his contribution ensured that the Gentlemen won by an innings and 14 runs. The Gentlemen team was actually quite good as it also included Beauclerk, John Willes, Edward Bligh, George Leycester and Arthur Upton. In the second match, Beldham went back to the Players and only Lambert was a given man. Lambert again had an outstanding game and the Gentlemen won by 82 runs, though it was Beauclerk's first innings score of 58 from only 96 that was decisive."]}, {"page": "George Leicester", "response": ["*George Leycester, cricketer", "*George Leycester (MP) for Thirsk (UK Parliament constituency)"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|George Leycester"]}, {"page": "Leycester, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Leycester"]}]}}
