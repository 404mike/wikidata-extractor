P., ed., Joyce and the Joyceans (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2002), p. 165.

David Hayman has suggested that \"For all the efforts made by critics to establish a plot for the Wake, it makes little sense to force this prose into a narrative mold.\"Hayman, David. The \"Wake\" in Transit, p.41, footnote 1 The book's challenges have led some commentators into generalised statements about its content and themes, prompting critic Bernard Benstock to warn against the danger of \"boiling down\" Finnegans Wake into \"insipid pap, and leaving the lazy reader with a predigested mess of generalizations and catchphrases.\"Benstock 1965, p.4. Fritz Senn has also voiced concerns with some plot synopses, saying \"we have some traditional summaries, also some put in circulation by Joyce himself. I find them most unsatisfactory and unhelpful, they usually leave out the hard parts and recirculate what we already think we know.
