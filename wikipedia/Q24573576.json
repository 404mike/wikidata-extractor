He is most notable for his work developing the Russell Hybrid Lupins. A gardner by occupation, he began experimenting with Lupins in his fifties, after being inspired by the sight of a vase of the flowers at the home of one of his employers.Over more than twenty years, he used natural pollination by bumble-bees to develop hybrids with flower spikes that were larger and more colourful than the original Lupinus polyphyllus. He was 79 when he first exhibited at Chelsea,  and  the Royal Horticultural Society awarded him the Veitch Memorial Medal in 1937 for his achievements.In 2013, when the RHS held a vote to determine their 'plant of the centenary', Russell Hybrid Lupins were selected as the top plant to have debuted during the period 1933-1942 and voted second overall.Some of the Lupins created by Russell were named after his friends and neighbours. These include the 'Mrs Micklethwaite', for the employer who originally inspired his work, and the 'Mrs Noel Terry' named after Kathleen Terry of the Terry's chocolate-manufacturing family. At one time there were 152 named varieties but in the years after Russell's death many of these were either lost to Cucumber mosaic virus or allowed to self-sow enabling them to revert to their original colours.Selective List of Russell Hybrid Lupins (with colours if known)\n\nBluejacket : blue and white\nCatherine of York\nGallery White\nGallery Yellow\nHelen of York\nJoan of York\nMasterpiece\nManhattan Lights\nMrs Micklethwaite\nMrs Noel Terry : pink\nMy Castle\nNellie B.

Almost a century later, George Russell, a horticulturist from York, UK, started to breed the (later famous) Russell hybrids (Lupinus \u00d7 russellii hort). Lupinus polphyllus were originally of basic colours and had large gaps in the flowering spike. Without the use of modern-day plant breeding techniques, Russell took to ruthlessly pulling out any plants which he deemed to be unacceptable in growth or display. He spent two decades single-handedly trying to breed the perfect lupin, crossing L. polyphyllus with L. arboreus, L. sulphureus and one or more annual species (maybe L. nootkatensis)."]}, {"page": "List of people from York", "response": ["*George Russell (1857\u20131951), horticulturalist who developed Russell hybrid lupins"]}, {"page": "Veitch Memorial Medal", "response": ["* 1937 : John Hutchinson (1884\u20131972), George Russell (1857-1951)"]}, {"page": "George Russell", "response": ["George Russell may refer to:", "* George Russell (composer) (1923\u20132009), American jazz composer and theorist", "* Lord George Russell (1790\u20131846), British general and diplomat", "* Sir George Russell, 4th Baronet (1828\u20131898), British politician and barrister", "* George Russell, 10th Duke of Bedford (1852\u20131893), British peer, politician and barrister", "* George Russell (footballer, born 1869) (1869\u20131930), Scottish footballer", "* George Russell (footballer, born 1893) (1893\u2013?), English outside right", "* George Russell (footballer, born 1902), English full back", "* George Russell (racing driver) (born 1998), British racing driver", "* George Russell (horticulturist) (1857\u20131951), British horticulturalist who developed Russell Hybrid Lupins"]}]}}
