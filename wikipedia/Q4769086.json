In 1979, he starred in Thark, opposite Annette Kerr, at York's Theatre Royal. Subsequent plays included Cabaret, Privates on Parade and Romeo and Juliet. In December 1979, Oldman appeared as Puss in Dick Whittington and His Cat, staged at York. He also acted in Colchester, then with Glasgow's Citizens Theatre; Oldman's work ethic and trademark intensity would make him a favourite with audiences in Glasgow during the 1980s. He also toured Europe and South America with the Citizens Theatre company."]}, {"page": "2point4 Children", "response": ["* Dora Grimes (Annette Kerr)"]}, {"page": "1920 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 July \u2013 Annette Kerr, actress (died 2013)"]}, {"page": "Doppelg\u00e4nger (1969 film)", "response": ["*Annette Kerr as Nurse"]}, {"page": "Murder Most Foul (film)", "response": ["* Annette Kerr as Dorothy, an actress and murder victim"]}, {"page": "The House by the Lake", "response": ["*Nurse Thomson - \tAnnette Kerr"]}, {"page": "Prudence and the Pill", "response": ["|       Annette Kerr  ||  Gerald's Secretary"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* Annette Kerr"]}, {"page": "So Evil, So Young", "response": ["* Annette Kerr as Workroom Wardress"]}, {"page": "Denville Hall", "response": ["*Annette Kerr"]}, {"page": "2013 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 23 || Annette Kerr || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 93 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| English || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actress || "]}, {"page": "Annette kerr", "response": ["#REDIRECT Annette Kerr "]}, {"page": "The Third Alibi", "response": ["* Annette Kerr as Cinema cashier"]}, {"page": "The Price of Silence (1960 film)", "response": ["* Annette Kerr - Miss Collins "]}, {"page": "Target Luna", "response": ["*Annette Kerr as Mrs Wedgwood"]}, {"page": "Death on the Rocks", "response": ["* Annette Kerr as Mrs. Ross "]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Annette Kerr, 93, actress."]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2013", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 23 || Annette Kerr || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 93 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| English || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actress || "]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2013", "response": ["*Annette Kerr, 93, British actress.Kerr"]}, {"page": "She Always Gets Their Man", "response": ["*Annette Kerr as Clara"]}, {"page": "Identified (UFO)", "response": ["* Annette Kerr \u2013 Nurse\t"]}, {"page": "Come On, Jeeves", "response": ["The play was presented by the Guildford Theatre Company at Guildford Theatre, opening on 20 June 1956.
