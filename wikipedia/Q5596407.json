He was also selected in the squad for a 2008\u201309 Guinness Premiership match against Bath.\nGrant signed for the Cornish Pirates at the end of May 2010, at the same time as prop James Currie. Grant proved a big hit in his first season with the Pirates, he displayed power and pace, making 30 appearances mainly on the wing and showed he could also kick a ball a fair old distance.\nIn total he crossed for 10 tries, 8 RFU Championship, one cup and one friendly and was unlucky to miss out on the end of season semi-final and two\u2013legged final matches, having had to undergo an appendicitis operation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grant (given name)", "response": ["*Grant Pointer (born 1982), English rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 RFU Championship", "response": ["|RW ||14|| Grant Pointer", "|RW ||14|| Grant Pointer", "|RW ||14|| Grant Pointer"]}, {"page": "Ben Maidment", "response": ["In 2013, Maidment moved to Jersey along with fellow Cornish Pirates players Aaron Penberthy and Grant Pointer. During pre-season, he was sent off against Coventry R.F.C. and was banned by the Rugby Football Union for a week. The ban was initially meant to be served during a friendly against French club, Le Rheu; however, this match did not go ahead. Jersey failed to inform the RFU and its officials that the ban was not served, and then fielded Maidment in their next match, against Plymouth Albion in the RFU Championship. As a result, Maidment and Jersey were charged by the RFU for \"failure to act towards the RFU with utmost good faith and/or conduct prejudicial to the interests of the Union and/or the Game\". The charge against Maidment was later dropped, but Jersey were fined \u00a35,000 and deducted two RFU Championship points."]}, {"page": "List of 2015\u201316 RFU Championship transfers", "response": ["* Grant Pointer released"]}, {"page": "Pointer (surname)", "response": ["* Grant Pointer (born 1987), English rugby union player"]}]}}
