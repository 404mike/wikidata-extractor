He made 68 appearances in the Football League for Small Heath.Lester was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire. He played football for Walsall Unity before joining First Division club Small Heath. They were relegated in 1895\u201396, Lester's first season with the club, but the next season he formed a sound fullback partnership with Billy Pratt. However, the arrival of Arthur Archer as first-choice right back meant Lester was in competition with Pratt for the left-back position, which restricted his appearances. He contributed to Small Heath's runners-up finish in 1900\u201301 season, thereby winning promotion back to the top flight, but left the club for Walsall later the same year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bill Purves", "response": ["Purves was born in Belfast and played for Glentoran before coming to England to join Small Heath in March 1894. He played in the last three matches of the 1893\u201394 Football League regular season and in the test match that confirmed their ascent to the First Division. He played every game of the club's first top-flight season, but lost his place to Frank Lester in 1895\u201396Matthews, pp. 142\u2013143. and returned to Glentoran.

Their only purchase was greeted with suspicion by the Dart: the 19-year-old Adam Fraser \"is said to be a most capable half-back. Whether he is worth all the trouble the club have gone through to secure him remains to be seen, but if he is anything like a 'class' player it is strange that he has never been heard of before.\" It was reported that the Cambridge University and England full back Lewis Vaughan Lodge had agreed to play for the club, but he did appear until February. Meanwhile, after a casual start, Small Heath came back from a three-goal deficit to beat Leyton 8\u20133 in a friendly. Winning ways continued in the League as they beat Nottingham Forest with a goal in the first five minutes, scored by Hands from a Hallam centre. Roach's performance in goal suggested he was the best of the four tried thus far, and Frank Lester made a promising debut at back, but both teams' forwards were disappointing."]}]}}
