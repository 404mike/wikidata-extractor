He is best known for his portrait work and decorative mosaics in St Paul's Cathedral in London.\nRichmond was influential in the early stages of the Arts and Crafts Movement in his selection of bold colours and materials for the mosaics in St Paul's Cathedral and in his collaboration with James Powell and Sons, glass makers, in creating new colours and materials. This new material expanded the glassmaker's palette and was favoured by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, primarily in the creation of stained-glass windows and decorative art work. Richmond was the Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford from 1878 to 1883, succeeding his friend and mentor John Ruskin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Industrial Revolution", "response": ["In industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.Harold L.

The entrance from the west portico is through a square domed narthex, flanked by chapels: the Chapel of St Dunstan to the north and the Chapel of the Order of St Michael and St George to the south. The nave is  in height and is separated from the aisles by an arcade of piers with attached Corinthian pilasters rising to an entablature. The bays, and therefore the vault compartments, are rectangular, but Wren roofed these spaces with saucer-shaped domes and surrounded the clerestory windows with lunettes. The vaults of the choir are decorated with mosaics by Sir William Blake Richmond.  The dome and the apse of the choir are all approached through wide arches with coffered vaults which contrast with the smooth surface of the domes and punctuate the division between the main spaces. The transepts extend to the north and south of the dome and are called (in this instance) the North Choir and the South Choir."]}, {"page": "Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll", "response": ["Upon Queen Victoria's death, Louise entered the social circle of her brother, the new King Edward VII, with whom she had much in common, including smoking.

It was put into storage until being exhibited again in 1892, but was again treated with derision. The painting was shown again at the Grafton Gallery in England in 1893, this time entitled L'Absinthe, where it sparked even greater controversy. The people and the absinthe represented in the painting were considered by English critics to be shockingly degraded and uncouth. Many regarded the painting as a blow to morality; this was the general view of such Victorians as Sir William Blake Richmond and Walter Crane when shown the painting in London. That reaction was typical of the age, revealing the deep suspicion with which Victorian England had regarded art in France since the early days of the Barbizon School, and the desire to find a morally uplifting lesson in works of art. Many English critics viewed the picture as a warning lesson against absinthe, and the French in general. The comment by George Moore on the woman depicted was: \"What a whore!\" He added, \"the tale is not a pleasant one, but it is a lesson\". However, in his book Modern Painting, Moore regretted assigning a moral lesson to the work, claiming that \"the picture is merely a work of art, and has nothing to do with drink or sociology.\"George Moore, Modern Painting (London: Walter Scott Publishing, 1898), p. 269."]}, {"page": "1842 in art", "response": ["* November 29 \u2013 William Blake Richmond, English painter and interior decorator (died 1921)"]}, {"page": "William Blake (disambiguation)", "response": ["* William Blake Richmond (1842\u20131921), English painter and decorator"]}, {"page": "English church monuments", "response": ["File:Bishop Edward King - geograph.org.uk - 318007.jpg|Monument in bronze to Bishop Edward King at Lincoln Cathedral by William Blake Richmond (1913)."]}, {"page": "North British Academy of Arts", "response": ["* Inaugural Address by Sir William Blake Richmond."]}, {"page": "Herbert Richmond", "response": ["Richmond was the second son of artist Sir William Blake Richmond, son of the portrait painter George Richmond.www.saxonlodge.net In July 1907 he married "]}, {"page": "Sir William Blake Richmond", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Blake Richmond"]}, {"page": "Frederick Tatham", "response": ["The son of Charles Heathcote Tatham, an architect, Tatham and his brother and sister were all associated with the Ancients.
