They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson. Other players included Albert Alderman, 55-year-old Harry Elliott in his final season, Alan Revill and Pat Vaulkhard.Playfair, pp. 91\u201392."]}, {"page": "Arthur Walker Richardson", "response": ["Richardson was born at Quarndon, Derbyshire.

In his first three seasons he managed a highest score of 70 and his best seasonal average was 25. He became Derbyshire captain in the 1931 season and led his team to 7th in the points table. In the 1932 season he scored 1,258 runs with an average of 29.95 and made his highest score of 90 against Nottinghamshire, although the team fell back to 10th in the Championship. He led the team progressively up to sixth in the 1933 season, third in the 1934 season, and second in the 1935 season with 16 wins. In the 1936 season the club won the County Championship winning 13 matches. He was supported by batsmen Stan Worthington, Leslie Townsend, Denis Smith and Albert Alderman each of whom scored over a thousand runs and several centuries. Bill Copson, Tommy Mitchell, Alf Pope and Leslie Townsend accounted for most of the wickets taken. Richardson finished his cricket career at the end of the 1936 season.Arthur Richardson at Cricket Archive Wisden stated that he achieved much by his own enthusiasm and warm personality."]}, {"page": "List of multi-sport athletes", "response": ["*Albert Alderman \u2013 also played football for Derby County and Burnley."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1939", "response": ["*Albert Alderman Catches 17, Stumping 1"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1928", "response": ["Guy Jackson was in his seventh season as captain. The season saw the arrival of three players who were significant in the club's victory in the County Championship in the 1936 season, including the captain of the team Arthur Walker Richardson.

Albert Alderman came through Sam Cadman's coaching scheme and scored over 12,000 runs for Derbyshire in the next 20 years. Two of the Hill Wood brothers Charles and Denis made their debuts and went on the play a couple of seasons for Derbyshire. Charles was at Oxford where he also played.

Gradually, they assembled a strong team and, by 1927, they had a decent side which finished fifth and commanded respect. Harry Elliott, Jim Hutchinson and Harry Storer junior all made their debuts in 1920 and, over the next five years, the team welcomed Leslie Townsend, Stan Worthington and Garnet Lee. Denis Smith, who has one of the longest first-class careers on record, first appeared in 1927. Albert Alderman began in 1928 and then the team really took shape as Derbyshire discovered Tommy Mitchell, Alf Pope, Bill Copson, Charlie Elliott and George Pope. From 1928 to 1933, the team was always in mid-table."]}]}}
