Nevertheless, the naval aspect was probably normally helpful to the Conservative vote at this period: by the early 20th century, Plymouth was one of England's most densely populated cities, and also had a high non-conformist population, which would normally have suggested a safe Liberal seat, but in fact the two parties polled fairly equally and Conservatives were elected more often than not.", "|rowspan=\"5\"| (Sir) Edward Clarke, QC"]}, {"page": "EG Clarke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Clarke (barrister)"]}, {"page": "Prince Francis Joseph of Braganza", "response": ["In August 1902, Prince Francis Joseph was in London to attend the coronation of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom as a member of the Austro-Hungarian mission.

A 24-year-old man and a seventeen-year-old boy were also charged with conspiring together to procure the commission of an act of gross indecency.  In opening the case, the prosecution said \"the offense with which the prince was charged was far too common in London.\"  The Prince was defended by Sir Edward Clarke, the former Solicitor General. A witness falsely claimed that he had made a hole in a bedroom door and that through the hole he had seen Francis Joseph and the fifteen-year-old boy engaged in sexual activity in a house in Lambeth. The witness's lies were undone by the police investigation. The police found that only nine inches of the bed were visible through the hole and therefore the witness could not have seen the matters as to which he had testified. The prosecutors therefore moved for a verdict of no guilt declaring that there was no evidence of guilt and the jury indeed pronounced Prince Francis Joseph not guilty."]}, {"page": "Romford Garden Suburb", "response": ["*Sir Edward Clarke"]}, {"page": "June 1906 City of London by-election", "response": ["The City of London by-election of June 1906 was held on 15 June 1906.

She was reported as saying she hoped they had 'worked off their hysteria'. In speaking against suffragette 'stoning' she reminded them that 'men in Bristol did \u00a314,000 of damage at the time of the Reform Bill' and told the hecklers to 'Put that in your pipes and smoke it!\".

Moreover, Queensberry accused Wilde of being involved in the publication of The Chameleon. During cross-examination, Queensberry's counsel, Edward Carson, asked Wilde about Alfred Douglas's poem \"Two Loves\" and Bloxam's story \"The Priest and the Acolyte\". Wilde denied that the former made any \"improper suggestion\", and protested that, contrary to Carson's claim, he had had no role in the inclusion of the latter, and did not approve of it. Wilde's attorney, Edward Clarke, claimed that Wilde was in fact so offended by \"The Priest and the Acolyte\" that, upon reading it, he wrote to the editor to demand that the magazine be withdrawn from publication."]}]}}
