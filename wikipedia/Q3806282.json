She scapes depressing us with her constant tales of relationship woes on the chorus of 'Freedom' which, despite the subject matter, has a wonderful gospel-like quality. That said, they're up against some seriously stellar competition \u2013 and while her collaborators may have an ear for a chorus, there's no question that Fall To Grace is unmistakably 'Paloma'\".", "* Jake Gosling \u2013 bass, drums, keyboards, producer, programming, background vocals"]}, {"page": "This Life (album)", "response": ["The album was recorded in the UK with Jake Gosling, best known for producing Ed Sheeran's multi-platinum debut album.", "Category:Albums produced by Jake Gosling"]}, {"page": "Small Bump", "response": ["\"Small Bump\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, released as the fifth single from his debut studio album, +.
