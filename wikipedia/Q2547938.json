John Gilbert \"Jack\" Cock DCM MM (14 November 1893 \u2013 19 April 1966) was a Cornish footballer who played for various English club sides as a striker. He also had the distinction of being the first Cornishman to play, and score, for the England national team. He was a decorated World War I soldier, and an actor. Chris Morris represented the Republic of Ireland at the 1990 World Cup & the 1988 European Championships. In 1901 Cornish miners founded the first football team in Mexico, Club de Futbol Pachuca. Originally, they practised only as a pastime during their free time they had while working at the mines. From 1917 to 1920, Pachuca was champion of the league under Cornish born coach Alfred C. Crowle. In 1966, Cornishman Mike Trebilcock scored two goals for Everton in the FA Cup Final at Wembley."]}, {"page": "Charlie Nicholas", "response": ["In summer 1990, Nicholas returned to Celtic. His comeback season at Parkhead saw him playing a total of 14 games and scoring six goals within the league. The arrival of new manager Liam Brady at Celtic in 1991 saw an improvement in fortune for Nicholas, and he went on to score 21 league goals during season 1991\u201392. In March 1992 he scored two outstanding goals in consecutive weeks. On 21 March he opened the scoring at Ibrox in a 2\u20130 win over Rangers; taking a long ball from a Chris Morris free kick, he volleyed home a powerful shot past goalkeeper Andy Goram. A week later on 28 March, he ran across the Dundee United defence 25 yards out and suddenly chipped the ball past an unsuspecting Alan Main. Despite his goalscoring, Celtic again failed to win any silverware. He lost his place in the team halfway through 1992\u201393 as Celtic bought Frank McAvennie, but regained his place the following season as McAvennie fell out of favour."]}, {"page": "Chris Morris", "response": ["* Chris Morris (footballer) (born 1963), former professional footballer who played for the Republic of Ireland", "* Chris Morris (basketball) (born 1966), retired American basketball player", "* Chris Morris (Canadian football) (born 1968), Canadian football offensive lineman for the Edmonton Eskimos", "* Chris Morris (American football, born 1983), American football guard and center for the Tennessee Titans", "* Chris Morris (American football, born 1949), American football tackle for the Cleveland Browns", "* Chris Morris (cricketer) (born 1987), South African cricketer", "* Chris Morris (author) (born 1946), science fiction and fantasy author; musician", "* Chris Morris (satirist) (born 1962), English satirical comedian, writer, and director", "* Chris Morris (journalist) (born 1964), BBC World Affairs Correspondent and author of The New Turkey", "* Chris Morris (music writer) (active since 1980s), Los Angeles-based music writer", "* Chris Morris (activist) (born 1979), gay rights activist"]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C.

Celtic's domestic form proved to be no better than the previous season, losing 1\u20130 to Aberdeen in the semi-final of the League Cup, a disappointing 2\u20130 defeat at Falkirk in the Scottish Cup, and a fourth-place finish in the league.  Europe provided a brief respite for Brady, Celtic recovering from a 2\u20130 first leg defeat away at Cologne in the UEFA Cup to win the return match in Glasgow 3\u20130, midfielder John Collins scoring the decisive third goal seven minutes from time.
