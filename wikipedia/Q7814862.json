Barcroft (1870 \u2013 26 September 1946) was the secretary-manager of Blackpool between 1903 and 1909. He was the Seasiders' first recognised manager, but his role was not full-time.\nA 33-year-old Barcroft was in charge for the first game of the 1903\u201304 season. Under his leadership, Blackpool won eleven and drew five of their 34 League games. They finished fourth from bottom.\nThe following campaign, 1904\u201305, saw an identical finishing position.\nThey finished 14th in 1905\u201306, 13th in 1906\u201307, before another 15th-placed finish in 1907\u201308.\nIn his final season at the helm, Blackpool finished bottom and had to apply for re-election to the Football League.\nBarcroft remained as secretary at Bloomfield Road for the next quarter-century. On 3 July 1934, he received an illuminated manuscript in recognition of his 31 years of service to the club.
