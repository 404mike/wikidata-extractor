It originally came with a purse of 50 sovereigns and was awarded to the top classicist going on to Oxbridge. The Trustees commissioned Sir Edward Thomason to cut the original die, and the image was based on a miniature painted by George Perfect Harding and owned by Dr Kennedy, now in the School collection. The medal was discontinued in 1855 when the stocks were exhausted, but was revived again in 1899. In 1980 the Salopian Club decided that the Medal should be open to all disciplines and not purely the Classics. Since that time the majority of recipients have excelled in the sciences."]}, {"page": "Catherine Howard, Countess of Suffolk", "response": ["Thomas Pennant wrote in his Journey from Chester to London published in 1782 wrote of her portrait then at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire:In the room is a fine full-length of the countess of Suffolk, daughter of Sir Henry Knevit, and wife to the lord treasurer.\u00a0 She is dressed in white, and in a great ruff; her breasts much exposed: her waist short and swelling; for she was extremely prolific.\u00a0 This lady had unhappily a great ascendancy over her husband, and was extremely rapacious.\u00a0 She made use of his exalted situation to indulge her avarice, and took bribes from all quarters.\u00a0 Sir Francis Bacon, in his speech in the star-chamber against her husband, wittily compares her to an exchange-woman, who kept her shop, while Sir John Bingley, a teller of the Exchequer, and a tool of her\u2019s, cried What d\u2019ye lack?

Sir George Scharf (1820\u20131895), artist and art historian, first Director and later trustee of the National Portrait Gallery, later drew a sketch of this engraving, which was based on this portrait. George Perfect Harding drew a pencil, watercolour and bodycolour copy of the portrait in 1811. Bodycolour is watercolour which is mixed with white pigment to make it opaque."]}, {"page": "Mary Villiers, Countess of Buckingham", "response": ["James Stow engraved a drawing of her by George Perfect Harding in 1814.Carole Levin, Anna Riehl Bertolet, Jo Eldridge Carney, A Biographical Encyclopedia of Early Modern Englishwomen, p. 142"]}, {"page": "James Stow", "response": ["Stow worked entirely as a line engraver.
