According to scholar Justyna Deszcz-Tryhubczak, the protagonist Fitz comes to appreciate \"the animal Other within his own personality\" through his bond with the wolf Nighteyes. She views Hobb's use of the wolf as deliberate, and as a reflection of the fact that \"humankind's relations with the wolf are more complex and intimate than any other wild creature\" (from critic Peter Hollindale). Scholar Lenise Prater highlights the symbolism of the wolf in Western literature as representing nature, and the werewolf as representing \"slippages between\" nature and culture. Unlike in a werewolf, Nighteyes' bond with Fitz is portrayed as a relationship between two independent beings, with the wolf valuing his privacy and independence. There is an element of otherness in how Nighteyes perceives the world, which continually shapes his bond with Fitz; the wolf views the world with more immediacy and is attuned to survival.

The narrator secretly assists the couple financially, while meeting with the young boy in various \"adventures\", presented in a disjointed series of episodes in the book in which the narrator seeks to find a feeling of closeness with the boy, expressed as a desire for fatherhood, as well as other less clearly defined ideas. Peter Hollindale, professor of English and Education Studies at the University of York (retired, 1999), has written extensively about James Barrie and the Peter Pan stories. He states that while modern psychology enables readers to find hints of various abnormalities in the story, it also remains \"strangely innocent and asexual\"."]}, {"page": "Hollindale, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Hollindale"]}]}}
