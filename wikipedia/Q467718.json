After learning his trade with Aberdeen in the early 1980s, he spent most of his playing career at Norwich City, the club with which he came to be most closely associated. This was followed by a brief spell back in Scotland with Hibernian before his retirement as a player in 1998.\nGunn feels the peak of his playing career was making what he calls the save of his life in the UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich in 1993. This event was called the summit of Norwich City's history by The Independent. He is one of only nine Norwich players to win the club's Player of the Year award twice. He was made an inaugural member of Norwich City's Hall of Fame. He was a member of the Scotland national football team, making six appearances for his country in the early 1990s.\nGunn worked for years behind the scenes at Norwich in a variety of roles, from matchday hosting to coaching. He was appointed temporary manager towards the end of the 2008\u201309 season and then confirmed as permanent manager during the summer. However, after a 7\u20131 home defeat in the opening game to local rivals Colchester United, he lost his job a week into the 2009\u201310 Football League One season.\nSince the death of his young daughter from leukaemia in 1992, Gunn has been extensively involved in fundraising to combat the disease and its effects. As of 2011 he has raised more than \u00a31 million for research into childhood leukaemia. The money has been used to fund projects to improve the lives of children with leukaemia and their families, notably a national telephone support line. The city of Norwich recognised Gunn's charity work and his long association with the city's football club by naming him Sheriff for 2002. Published in 2006, his autobiography, In Where it Hurts: My Autobiography, includes a foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1963", "response": ["** Bryan Gunn, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Alex Ferguson", "response": ["Many of Ferguson's former players have gone on to become football managers themselves, including Tony Fitzpatrick, Alex McLeish, Gordon Strachan, Mark McGhee, Willie Miller, Neale Cooper, Bryan Gunn, Eric Black, Billy Stark, Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Roy Keane, Paul Ince, Chris Casper, Mark Robins, Darren Ferguson, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, Henning Berg, Andrei Kanchelskis, Michael Appleton, Ryan Giggs, David Healy, Gabriel Heinze, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Jaap Stam, and Phil Neville.

He worked as a research scientist until 1971, when he became a senior biology lecturer and was promoted to Dean of the School of Biological Sciences in 1991. Whilst a Dean, he headed a research team investigating cancer because of his expertise in the biology of cancer and drugs targeting leukaemia. Upon his suggestion, Norwich City goalkeeper Bryan Gunn funded the Francesca Gunn laboratory, named after the daughter he lost to leukaemia, which he ran for five years. He was awarded a Champion Award by Macmillan Cancer Support for his work.

This ensured a fiery return fixture, held at the Community Stadium in January 2010.
