Toynbee Hall had been founded in 1884, and female students resolved to set up a similar project. Representatives from Girton College and Newnham College at Cambridge University, and Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville College at Oxford University, formed the Women's University Association. A Newnham student Alice Gruner was appointed Head Worker, and the organization was based at her house at 44 Nelson Square, Southwark. Other Newnham students involved in the venture included Mary Paley Marshall, Nora Sidgwick, and the Prime Minister's daughter Helen Gladstone. Octavia Hill, who became a housing reformer and founder of the National Trust, was also an active member. In 1888 the Association was renamed the Women's University Settlement. Gruber resigned as Warden, and in 1891 a paid Warden, Margaret Sewell, was appointed. By 1895 the Settlement had 31 resident and 61 non-resident workers. It organized children's clubs, holiday treats and classes in music and dance for local children. Helen Gladstone served as Warden in the early twentieth century.
