The wider punk subculture itself had flirted with extreme political symbolism, as a form of \"shock value\" from its early days, including anarchist, communist and nazi symbols, though many did not take this seriously. Eventually some bands such as Crass in the United Kingdom began to more seriously integrate an anarcho-communist political ideology into their music and associated anarcho-punk subculture. This spread to the United States and had a strong influence on the Minneapolis hardcore scene. Some of the people involved in this scene created a skinhead street gang, inspired by Nick Knight's book Skinhead, known as the Minneapolis Baldies which was formed in 1986. The Baldies, who regarded themselves as on the left and anti-racist skinheads, were frequently engaged in political violence with rival far-right skinheads in Uptown. The Baldies were associated with bands such as Blind Approach, while their rivals from the East Side, the White Knights, were associated with Mass Corruption. According to Mic Crenshaw, the Baldies were allied to Black and Latino organized crime gangs in the area.
