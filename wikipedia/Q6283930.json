He was Consul in Formosa (1895\u201397) after the First Sino-Japanese War and at Nagasaki (1897\u20131902).\nAfter retiring from the service he became the first Professor of Japanese at King's College London until 1916, and then an emeritus professor of the University of London. He was awarded a D.Litt. by his alma mater, Queen's University of Belfast in 1919.\nAlthough not in the front rank of British Japanologists in the 19th century occupied by Ernest Satow, Basil Hall Chamberlain, William George Aston and arguably Frederick Victor Dickins, he did make a notable contribution in the field of early Japanese studies.", "link_mentions": {}}}
