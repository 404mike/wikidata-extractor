He was awarded a D.Litt. by his alma mater, Queen's University of Belfast in 1919.\nAlthough not in the front rank of British Japanologists in the 19th century occupied by Ernest Satow, Basil Hall Chamberlain, William George Aston and arguably Frederick Victor Dickins, he did make a notable contribution in the field of early Japanese studies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Mason Satow", "response": ["*Joseph Henry Longford"]}, {"page": "John Harington Gubbins", "response": ["*Joseph Henry Longford"]}, {"page": "Thomas Blake Glover", "response": ["* Joseph Henry Longford was a friend of Glover"]}, {"page": "Japan\u2013United Kingdom relations", "response": ["*Joseph Henry Longford - Consul and Academic"]}, {"page": "List of Queen's University Belfast people", "response": ["* Joseph Henry Longford \u2013 British consul in Japan and academic"]}, {"page": "British Japan Consular Service", "response": ["*Joseph Henry Longford, served 1869 to 1902"]}, {"page": "Joseph Longford", "response": ["#Redirect Joseph Henry Longford"]}, {"page": "The Japan Society of the UK", "response": ["* Joseph Henry Longford - Vice-President in 1922"]}, {"page": "The Cambridge Modern History", "response": ["|Joseph Henry Longford"]}]}}
