However, the photos were not used as Drake's rapidly deteriorating appearance, hunched figure and blank expression were not considered good selling points. Island's creative director Annie Sullivan, who oversaw the shoot, recalled the difficulty in making a decision around the cover of the LP: \"I remember going to talk to [Nick], and he just sat there, hunched up, and even though he didn't speak, I knew the album was called Pink Moon, and I can't remember how he conveyed it, whether he wrote it down\u00a0... he wanted a pink moon. He couldn't tell me what he wanted, but I had 'pink moon' to go on.\" Island picked a piece of surrealist Dal\u00ed-esque art by Michael Trevithick, who was incidentally a friend of Drake's sister Gabrielle.
