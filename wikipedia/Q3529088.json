Williams' books include Black August, which won a Crime Writers' Association award. His novels have been translated into French, Italian, Danish, Russian, Bulgarian, Polish, and Japanese.\nWilliams' first French novel, Un autre soleil, set in the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, was published in Paris by Rivages in March 2011 and was published in English in New York City in April 2013 as Another Sun.\nWilliams was born in Walthamstow (Essex, now London) and attended Woodford Green Preparatory School,  Chigwell School and St Andrews University. He has previously lived in France, Italy, and in Romania, where he worked for the British Council.\nWilliams is among the small number of authors writing Italian crime novels in English (including Magdalen Nabb, Michael Dibdin, and Donna Leon), three of whom are British and were born in the span of a single year. Ms. Nabb's Death of an Englishman was published in 1981 and Williams' Converging Parallels followed in 1982. Williams is also the author of a soon to be published series of crime novels set in Guadeloupe in the French West Indies featuring Anne Marie Lavaud, a juge d'instruction. Mr. Williams, who holds dual British/French citizenship, currently lives on the island of Guadeloupe and teaches in the main lyc\u00e9e of Pointe \u00e0 Pitre.\nFor the Observer Timothy Williams is one of the ten best European crime novelists. \"The five books in Williams\u2019s Commissario Trotti series, written from 1982\u201396, are hard to find, but if you liked Zen (Dibdin\u2019s books or the TV series) you\u2019ll enjoy Trotti just as much. A delight.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walthamstow", "response": ["* Timothy Williams, bilingual novelist of crime fiction, lived at Whipps Cross"]}, {"page": "Chigwell School", "response": ["* Timothy Williams, crime novelist"]}, {"page": "Soucouyant", "response": ["* In Timothy Williams's  Guadeloupe novel, \"Un autre soleil\", \"Another Sun\" the spelling soucougnan is adopted in both French and English.
