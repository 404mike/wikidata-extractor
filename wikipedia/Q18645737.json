Just three matches of the 1939\u201340 season were played before the season was abandoned and competitive football was suspended for the duration of the Second World War. Manley's duties with the RAF meant that he appeared sparingly for the club during the war, making just 36 appearances and scoring six goals by the end of the 1945\u201346 season. Competitive football resumed for the 1946\u201347 season and Manley would go on to make 122 appearances and scored 8 goals for the club before making his final appearance in September 1950. He remained as Griffin Park as a reserve team player for the 1951\u201352 season (playing one match as a goalkeeper) before retiring at age 39 in May 1952. Manley was awarded a joint-testimonial with Ted Gaskell versus a Tommy Lawton XI in April 1954."]}, {"page": "Johnny Paton", "response": ["Paton lamented the standard of football coaching in England in the early 1950s and said \"many managers deliberately starved their players of the ball during the week, believing it made them more hungry for it out on the pitch on a Saturday\". Paton and Brentford teammates Ron Greenwood and Jimmy Hill enrolled on the first ever FA coaching course at Lilleshall in the early 1950s. One of the instructors was Brentford goalkeeper Ted Gaskell and Paton roomed with Greenwood, Hill and Malcolm Allison. Paton also led the Hertfordshire FA's youth coaching scheme during the 1954\u201355 season."]}, {"page": "December 1916", "response": ["* Born: Ted Gaskell, English association football player, goalkeeper for Brentford from 1937 to 1952, in Bredbury, England (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "Alf Jefferies (footballer, born 1922)", "response": ["Jefferies turned professional and joined Second Division club Brentford in September 1947 and finally made his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Southampton on 29 October 1949. Jefferies went on to largely keep established goalkeepers Ted Gaskell and Reg Newton out of the team, but he finally lost his place to Newton during a disastrous 1953\u201354 season, in which Brentford were relegated to the Third Division South.

The team later competed in the Seanglian League in 1959\u201360 and finished in mid-table. The As fared worse the following season, finishing second from bottom and was disbanded. The team was managed by former first team goalkeeper Ted Gaskell, with Eddie Lyons as his assistant. Future key players John Docherty, Tommy Higginson and Peter Gelson began their Brentford careers in the team."]}]}}
