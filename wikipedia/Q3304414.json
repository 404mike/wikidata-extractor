Tina's pregnancy scare is later discovered to be a false alarm and Peter vows to stand by Carla and raise their child. Tina asks Peter to move away with her to a new life away from Weatherfield.

Producer Stuart Blackburn told Inside Soap: \"Tina's had a hideous old year with the surrogacy drama and losing Tommy \u2013 but she's no saint. She's capable of making mistakes and falling in love with the wrong person. She'll start a feud with Tracy and Rob, before falling into Peter's arms. Unfortunately for Tina, she'll find herself in a place where both Tracy and Carla have reasons to hate her!\" Speaking about the story, Gascoyne told TV Times: \"Peter is really lustful for Tina. I think he almost sees a younger Carla in her. He found it really exciting when she put up a fight against Tracy. He admired her spirit and started to see her in a different light. Peter adores Carla, but he feels a bit neglected. He even tells Tina that, despite everything Carla has done for him, he's still not happy. Peter knows it's not a good idea to be around Tina, but he really doesn't want to stop seeing her.\" Gascoyne added: \"Put it this way, Peter Barlow and a wedding is bound to spell disaster. It certainly won't be dull. Whatever happens, it will be brilliant. Peter's had a good go at weddings \u2013 this will be his fifth. That tells you something.\" Michelle Keegan revealed that Tina's fling with Peter could be her most passionate relationship yet. Speaking to TV Times about the story, Keegan explained: \"Peter had never been on Tina's radar, but suddenly she feels completely out of control. She's never felt like this about anyone before. She didn't really have a passionate relationship with Tommy, but she can see herself having one with Peter.\" She continued: \"Tina is troubled by her feelings because she really likes Carla and she's not the sort of girl to do that to another woman. It's hard because she finds herself weakening whenever Peter is around. It gets to a point where Tina tells Peter that it might be best if she stops looking after Simon because she feels so out of control around him.\" As the story progresses, Tina begins to hope that Peter will not go through with his wedding to Carla. Keegan added: \"If he does, I'm not sure Tina will enjoy sticking around to watch the marriage unfold.
