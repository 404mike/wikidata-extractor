Dafydd James said that it was a good thing. This was coming from his personal experience from being injured after being rushed back into rugby from the tour. Roberts would return to regional training with the Blues in late September or early October. And despite having become a well-known figure on the Lions tour, Roberts would also face stiff competition for a centre spot from new signings Casey Laulala and Gavin Evans alongside Dafydd Hewitt, who was returning from a long-term injury. The Blues lost their opening two matches to Edinburgh and Munster, with Roberts being rested. He then returned for the match with Connacht but only lasted till halftime with an ankle injury forcing him off. The Blues lost again 18\u201316. The following Monday, Roberts was cleared to play in the game against the Scarlets in the first Welsh derby of the season. But he was once again forced off before halftime, this time with a neck injury. The Blues claimed their first victory of the season 19\u201315. But Roberts would be ruled out for ten days with the neck injury meaning he would miss the game against Glasgow Warriors, which the Blues would lose 21\u20135. Having lost 4 of the 5 games going into the Heineken Cup opener against Harlequins, Roberts returned to partner Tom Shanklin in the centre. The Blues claimed a 20\u20136 victory. Roberts set up the opening try for Tom James, as well as getting over the gainline, and also booting a 70-metre kick before halftime. The Blues then took on the Sale Sharks the following week. They lost 27\u201326 in a close game. Next up was the Ospreys in the biggest attendance at their new stadium. Roberts and Tom Shanklin were very good in defence. The Welsh squad was named the next day, with Roberts included."]}, {"page": "2008 European Sevens Championship", "response": ["| Dafydd Hewitt"]}, {"page": "2009 Australia national rugby union team tour", "response": ["|IC ||12|| Dafydd Hewitt "]}, {"page": "Judgement Day (rugby union)", "response": ["|IC ||12|| Dafydd Hewitt", "|IC ||12|| Dafydd Hewitt"]}, {"page": "2014 Wales rugby union tour of South Africa", "response": ["|CE ||23||Dafydd Hewitt || || "]}, {"page": "List of 2015\u201316 Pro12 transfers", "response": ["* Dafydd Hewitt retired"]}, {"page": "2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens squads \u2013 Men", "response": ["#Dafydd Hewitt"]}]}}
