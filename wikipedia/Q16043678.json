He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1881 to 1902, representing the electorates of Stanley (1881-1884) and Gladstone (1884-1902). He was Commissioner for Public Works under John Cox Bray from 1881 to 1884 and again under Thomas Playford II from 1887 to 1889.Catt was born in Newington, Kent, England, third child of Charles Catt, a carpenter, and his wife Sarah, n\u00e9e Knott.\nCatt arrived in South Australia in 1847, and for ten years engaged in agricultural pursuits at Balhannah and Strathalbyn. After a short trial of the Victorian diggings he returned to Strathalbyn, and entered into business. Subsequently he opened a store at the then youthful town of Gladstone, South Australia.Catt was elected to the Assembly for the district of Stanley, 27 April 1881. Three years later, when the constituency was reconstructed, he was returned for Gladstone. Catt accepted the post of Commissioner of Crown Lands in John Bray's first administration, on 24 June 1881, and held it till 23 April 1884, under circumstances of special difficulty. Disasters had fallen thickly upon the farmers of the colony, especially in the northern districts lying beyond Goyder's Line of rainfall, where thirsty and often heavily timbered country had been taken up at extravagant prices by the competing agriculturists, who in some cases had offered as much as \u00a36 6s. per acre. The attempt to grow wheat in these parts proved that the selectors could not pay the stipulated price, and the Government of the day came to the rescue with a proposal that the farmers should be allowed to surrender their land and compete for it again. The result was that they got their land back at about \u00a31 0s. 6d., thus entailing upon the State a nominal loss of about half a million. The surrender clauses were admittedly difficult to administer, and Mr. Catt was much blamed at the time for allowing farmers holding excellent land in the lower north and south-east to come under these clauses. Catt, however, claimed that these were exceptional cases. On the fall of the John Downer Ministry in 1887, Catt accepted the portfolio of Commissioner of Public Works under Thomas Playford II, and held it from 11 June 1887, to 27 June 1889. At the commencement of the session of 1890 Catt was unanimously elected to the Chairmanship of Committees of the Legislative Assembly. In 1887 he received the royal permission to bear the title of \"Honourable\" within the colony.Catt died in St Peters, Adelaide, South Australia, on 28 October 1919.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Catt", "response": ["*Alfred Catt (1833\u20131919), Australian parliamentarian"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Gladstone (South Australia)", "response": ["| rowspan=3|Alfred Catt"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Stanley (South Australia)", "response": ["| Alfred Catt", "| rowspan=2|Alfred Catt"]}, {"page": "James Henderson Howe", "response": ["Howe stood for the seat in conjunction with Alfred Catt; both were elected.

Custance", "response": ["It was envisaged that an institution combining the functions of an Experimental Farm and Agricultural College be established. To this end, Custance, the Commissioner for Crown Lands Alfred Catt, Samuel Davenport and Sir Robert Dalrymple Ross chose a property near Smithfield, which had the merits of being close to the city and a railway station, but their choice was overruled on the grounds the land was too good, and that more useful experiments could be made on land that had been exhausted by wheatgrowing, and the property purchased in 1882 was Olive Hill Farm, of  at Kangaroo Flat,  west of Roseworthy. He arrived unaccompanied, in late July on the s.s. Malwa which left Britain on 1 June.", "Though an excellent teacher and researcher and an able administrator, Custance was by all reports an obstinate and irascible man (\"Professor Crusty\" was a nickname), and lacked the subtlety which might have won him more battles. Previous ministers with the portfolio Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration (Alfred Catt, Jenkin Coles and Thomas Playford) seemed to have coped with his obstinacy, but James Henderson Howe was clearly more interested in maintaining the upper hand than a working relationship. The tipping point came at examination time when Custance requested two examiners and Howe sent three. Nobody would back down and Custance resigned his (honorary) position as Principal on 8 December 1886. Howe thereupon gave Custance three months' notice of the termination of his appointment as Professor."]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1890\u20131893", "response": ["|| Hon Alfred Catt ||  || Gladstone || 1881\u20131906"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1887\u20131890", "response": ["|| Hon Alfred Catt || Gladstone || 1881\u20131906"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1884\u20131887", "response": ["|| Alfred Catt || Gladstone || 1881\u20131906"]}, {"page": "Commissioner of Public Works (South Australia)", "response": ["| Alfred Catt"]}, {"page": "Hundred of Catt", "response": ["The Hundred of Catt is a cadastral hundred in the County of Way, South Australia established in 1889.
