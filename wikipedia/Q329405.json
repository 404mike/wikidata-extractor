There he \"assimilated native culture [...,] took a Nauruan wife, fathered several children, and was adopted as a Nauruan. He became perhaps the only beachcomber the Nauruans ever fully accepted and trusted.\" He acted as an intermediary between his people of adoption and passing European trade vessels.In 1881, Harris informed the Royal Navy that civil war had broken out on the island.In 1888, when Nauru became a German protectorate, he assisted the German authorities in informing the Nauruans of the way in which the country would be governed, and in persuading them to relinquish their firearms, with which a third of the population had been killed during the civil war.In 1889, his canoe was swept away to sea by strong currents, and he was not seen again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Nauru", "response": ["In 1886, Germany was granted the island under the Anglo-German Declaration.

Gowdy: Paradise for Sale: A Parable of Nature, University of California Press, 2000, , page 35. Accompanied by William Harris the German marines marched around the island and returned with the twelve chiefs, the white settlers and a Gilbertese missionary. The chiefs were kept under house arrest until the next morning, when the annexation ceremony began with the raising of the German flag. The Germans told the chiefs that they had to surrender all weapons and ammunition within 24 hours or the chiefs would be taken prisoner. By the morning of 3 October 765 guns and 1,000 rounds of ammunition had been turned over. The Germans called the island Nawodo or Onawero. The arrival of the Germans ended the war, and social changes brought about by the war established kings as rulers of the island, the most widely known being King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands also arrived in 1888.Ellis, A. F. 1935. Ocean Island and Nauru - their story. Angus and Robertson Limited. pp 29-39 The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades.
