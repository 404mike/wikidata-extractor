It was controversial and polarizing, setting these elements in a context of 19th-century English society, including disputes in the Church, the National School movement, the overall class structure of English society, and changing circumstances of rural labour. During the era of first-wave feminism, civil divorce was introduced and campaigns were waged against child prostitution, moving gender and sexuality issues to the forefront of public discussion. Hardy's work was criticized as vulgar, though by the late 19th century other experimental fiction works were released such as Florence Dixie's depiction of feminist utopia, The Story of an African Farm by Olive Schreiner, and Sarah Grand's work The Heavenly Twins. These raised awareness of syphilis and advocating sensitivity rather than condemnation for young women infected with it."]}, {"page": "1916 in literature", "response": ["*Sarah Grand \u2013 The Winged Victory"]}, {"page": "1912 in literature", "response": ["*Sarah Grand  \u2013 Adam's Orchard"]}, {"page": "1897 in literature", "response": ["*Sarah Grand \u2013 The Beth Book"]}, {"page": "1893 in literature", "response": ["*Sarah Grand \u2013 The Heavenly Twins"]}, {"page": "1854 in literature", "response": ["**Sarah Grand, Irish author and women's rights advocate (died 1943)"]}, {"page": "The Woman Who Did", "response": ["Sarah Grand, the feminist writer who coined the term \"New Woman,\" considered the novel to have and important social purity moral:Mr. Grant Allen is a large-minded, liberal man, and he argues that if men are permitted to practice polygamy then women should be equally free to indulge in polyandry. I do not know that he approves of polygamy, only he is liberal enough to say that if men are to claim sexual freedom then it should be accorded to women also. The story answers the question when followed to its logical conclusions, and shows very clearly that women have nothing to gain and everything to lose by renouncing the protection which legal marriage gives.Thomas Hardy approved more of Allen's progressive aims in the novel, than of their artistic realisation.M.

In 1894, Irish writer Sarah Grand (1854\u20131943) used the term \"new woman\" in an influential article, to refer to independent women seeking radical change, and in response the English writer Ouida (Maria Louisa Rame) used the term as the title of a follow-up article.See Sally Ledger, 'The New Woman: Fiction and Feminism at the Fin de Siecle', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997. The term was further popularized by British-American writer Henry James, who used it to describe the growth in the number of feminist, educated, independent career women in Europe and the United States. Independence was not simply a matter of the mind: it also involved physical changes in activity and dress, as activities such as bicycling expanded women's ability to engage with a broader, more active world.", "In fiction, New Woman writers included Olive Schreiner, Annie Sophie Cory (Victoria Cross), Sarah Grand, Mona Caird, George Egerton, Ella D'Arcy and Ella Hepworth Dixon. Some examples of New Woman literature are Victoria Cross's Anna Lombard (1901), Dixon's The Story of a Modern Woman and H. G. Wells's Ann Veronica (1909). Kate Chopin's The Awakening (1899) also deserves mention, especially within the context of narratives derived from Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856), both of which chronicle a woman's doomed search for independence and self-realization through sexual experimentation."]}, {"page": "Donaghadee", "response": ["*Sarah Grand, author and feminist "]}, {"page": "The Vicar of Wakefield", "response": ["The novel is mentioned in George Eliot's Middlemarch, Stendhal's The Life of Henry Brulard, Arthur Schopenhauer's \"The Art of Being Right\", Jane Austen's Emma, Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities and David Copperfield, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Sarah Grand's The Heavenly Twins, Charlotte Bront\u00eb's The Professor and Villette, Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther, as well as his Dichtung und Wahrheit.
