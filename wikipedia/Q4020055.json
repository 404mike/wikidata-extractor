In 1470, he was a singer at Lincoln Cathedral, in 1476, he was a vicar choral at Lincoln, and from 1477 until 1484, he was the Cathedral choirmaster. He has three complete pieces and one incomplete piece in the Eton Choirbook, and one incomplete piece in a York manuscript.Horwood's \"Magnificat secundi toni a 5\" bears a strong resemblance to compositions of his near contemporary Josquin des Prez (c. 1440\u20131521), so much so that he might easily be mistaken for Josquin upon first audition. No mention is made of Horwood among the listing of Josquin's contemporaries in Grout; neither is the Eton Choirbook mentioned in Grout.\nA very scanty on-line article \u2013 only a thumbnail description of the composer \u2013 is present on (FM 99.5, New York) WBAI producer Chris Whent's Here of a Sunday Morning site.

The first phase is represented by the music of Richard Hygons, William Horwood and Gilbert Banester.  Most of the music of this early phase is polyphonic but non-imitative, with contrast achieved by alternation of full five-voice texture with sections sung by fewer voices.  The second phase, which includes music by John Browne, Richard Davy and Walter Lambe, uses imitation, cantus firmus techniques, and frequent cross-relations (a feature which was to become a distinctive sound in early Tudor polyphony).  The final phase represented in the choirbook includes music by William Cornysh and Robert Fayrfax, composed around 1500.  Points of imitation are frequent, cantus firmus techniques disappear, and in general the sound of the music is more Continental.", "* 17.  f. 30v-32: Salve regina mater misericordiae - William Horwood", "* 36.  f. 74v-76: Gaude flore virginali - William Horwood", "* 37.  f. 76v-77v: Gaude virgo mater Christi - William Horwood", "* 71.  f. 111v-113: Magnificat: Et exultavit spiritus meus - William Horwood", "The composers represented in the manuscript are: John Browne (10 works), Richard Davy (9), Walter Lambe (8), Robert Wilkinson (7), William Cornysh (5), William Horwood (4), Robert Fayrfax (2), John Fawkyner (2), Nicholas Huchyn (2), Hugh Kellyk (2), Edmund Turges (2), Gilbert Banester, Brygeman (1), Robert Hacomplaynt (1), John Hampton (1), Holynborne (1), Richard Hygons (1), Nesbet (1), Edmund Sturton (1), John Sutton (1), Sygar (1) and William Stratford (1)."]}, {"page": "Gilbert Banester", "response": ["Possibly a native of London, he was Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal from 1478 to 1490.
