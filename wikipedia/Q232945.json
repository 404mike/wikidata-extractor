The producers were concerned with the confusing nature of the initial proposal, but felt that further changes greatly improved it. Wil Wheaton appeared as Wesley Crusher, replacing the initial plan to include Tasha Yar, after Braga was concerned about copying \"Yesterday's Enterprise\". \"Parallels\" received Nielsen ratings of 12.8 percent, one of the highest for the season, but some fans were upset at a Worf/Deanna Troi romance.
