Rovers had the best of the game but they lacked a cutting edge to see off Telford and ultimately they went on to lose in a penalty shoot-out. Telford goalkeeper Ryan Young saved penalties from Andy Mangan, Conal Platt, and Paul Lloyd, whilst Jon Adams, Mark Danks, and Gavin Cowan were all successful from the spot for United."]}, {"page": "Paul Lloyd", "response": ["Paul Lloyd may refer to:", "* Paul Lloyd (boxer) (born 1968), English boxer", "* Paul Lloyd (footballer) (born 1987), English football midfielder", "* PJ Black (Phillip Paul Lloyd, born 1981), South African professional wrestler"]}]}}
