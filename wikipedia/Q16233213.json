He rejected advice to take an older mentor as his assistant and instead retained existing coaches Richard Cooper and Micky Moore, who he said were \"as hungry as I am for coaching\". Murray's first game as manager, a day later at Field Mill, was a 1\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. After a successful month as caretaker-manager, Murray was given the job on a permanent basis on 5 December, becoming the youngest manager in the top four divisions of English football. He made four free transfer signings in the January transfer window: defenders Junior Brown, Michael Raynes and Matty Blair, and midfielder Ricky Ravenhill. He sold Rob Taylor to Tranmere Rovers after the versatile player sought a move closer to his home. He also made use of the loan market, bringing in Billy Kee, Callum Elder, Lenny Pidgeley, Jeffrey Monakana, Adam Smith and Terry Hawkridge. Murray signed a new two-year contract in May. Mansfield ended the 2014\u201315 season in 21st-place, seven points above relegated Cheltenham Town, and Murray released seven players in the summer, saying that \"I feel the whole club needs a fresh start\". Ollie Palmer was also sold to Leyton Orient."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|14||Terry Hawkridge||RW||||Nottingham||||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||4 June 2013||Gainsborough Trinity||Free||30 June 2014", "|14||MF||Terry Hawkridge||1||1||0||0||2", "|14||MF||Terry Hawkridge||3||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||4||0"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|33||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Terry Hawkridge", "|20 March 2015||Terry Hawkridge||Scunthorpe United||Loan (2 month loan)||"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|14||Terry Hawkridge||RW||||Nottingham||||66||2||Gainsborough Trinity||4 June 2013||Undisclosed||2016", "|14||MF|| Terry Hawkridge                                             ||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Scunthorpe United F.C. season", "response": ["|14||Terry Hawkridge||RW||||Nottingham||||66||2||Gainsborough Trinity||4 June 2013||Undisclosed||2016", "|1 September 2015||RM||||Terry Hawkridge||Lincoln City||4 January 2016||"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["| ||Terry Hawkridge||RM||||Nottingham||||0||0||Lincoln City||1 July 2017||Free||2019"]}, {"page": "Burnley F.C. 0\u20131 Lincoln City F.C.

Lincoln approached the game using their players in numbers to Burnley's tactics. In the first half, both rams had chances with Lincoln's Jack Muldoon shooting over the crossbar and Burnley's Andre Gray getting a shot on target but it was saved by Lincoln goalkeeper Paul Farman. The first half finished 0\u20130. During the second half, there was a contest between Burnley's Joey Barton and Lincoln's Matt Rhead which eventually ended up in a brawl inside Lincoln's penalty area when Rhead claimed Barton had stamped on him and then Barton pushed Terry Hawkridge in the face and received a yellow card for it. Lincoln then started putting crosses into Burnley's penalty area. Eventually Lincoln scored on 89 minutes with their first and only shot on target of the game due to a header from Sean Raggett, which was confirmed via goal-line technology. Burnley responded with a number of attacks during five minutes of stoppage time, forcing Lincoln to defend a number of shots and corner kicks however Lincoln held on for the win becoming the first non-league side in 103 years to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals.
