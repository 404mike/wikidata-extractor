The Sentinel commented that \"gloom has descended\" following a poor start to the season, however the Vale's form improved after Low sold Dennis Fidler to Grimsby Town for \u00a32,000, signed Colin Grainger from Leeds United for \u00a36,000, and further added to his firepower by signing Ralph Hunt from Swindon Town for \u00a33,500. Stanley Matthews' return to the Victoria Ground resulted in Low unsuccessfully trying to tempt Tom Finney out of retirement.
