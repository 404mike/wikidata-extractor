In 16th century Europe, traveling teams of players performed a form of improvisational theatre known as the Commedia dell'arte, with stock situations, stock characters and improvised dialogue. In the 19th and early 20th century, many board games and parlour games such as the game Jury Box included elements of role-playing. Mock trials, model legislatures, and the \"Theatre Games\" created by Viola Spolin arose, in which players took on the roles of characters and improvised, but without the formalised rules which would characterise modern role-playing games.Role-Playing Games: An Overview , Andrew Rilstone in Inter*Action #1, 1994"]}, {"page": "Fantasy wargame", "response": ["The rise in popularity in wargaming of the 1950s through to the 1970s largely coincided with the rise in popularity of J.

Wallis began publishing his own fanzines, first WEREMAN and then Sound & Fury, and got to know game designer Erick Wujcik through the latter; Wujcik introduced Wallis to Kevin Siembieda at Gen Con 22 in 1989, resulting in Wallis writing two books for Palladium Books, Mutants in Avalon (1990) and Mutants in Orbit (1992). Wallis also began working on his own role-playing game based on the Bugtown comics, and in 1992 he brought the game to Phage Press, where it stalled for two years due to creative differences.

Wallis based the company in the UK, and got a license from Phil Gallagher at Games Workshop to publish books for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Wallis and Andrew Rilstone changed the name of the magazine Inter*action to Interactive Fantasy due to trademark concerns beginning with its second issue, which was also Hogshead's first publication; the magazine only lasted two more issues after that. Warhammer sold well, but Hogshead had problems with their distributor, and Wallis had to let go of all the company's staff. By the end of 1997, cashflow had improved so Wallis moved the company to an office, and hired Matthew Pook. Phil Masters contributed adventures to Hogshead Publishing's licensed version of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay in the mid-1990s.
