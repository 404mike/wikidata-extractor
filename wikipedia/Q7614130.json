Following this announcement, Chairman Tony Stewart relieved Robins of his managerial duties, placing him on 'Gardening Leave'. Assistant manager John Breckin took charge of the team overseeing their 3\u20131 win over Chesterfield, moving the Millers to top of the league. However, that evening Barnsley FC requested to speak with Breckin, along with first-team coach Steve Taylor and fitness coach Nick Daws, with regards to following Mark Robins to Oakwell. All 3 accepted, and were subsequently placed on gardening leave along with Robins. An announcement was set to be made at 2.15pm on Monday 7 September to unveil Robins as the new manager of Barnsley, however talks stalled due to a disagreement over compensation. All is fair in love, war and appointing football managers? Mark finally left the millers on Wednesday 9 September, having signed a contract with Barnsley the previous evening, leaving Steve Thornber in temporary charge. The Millers drew their first two matches under Thornber's charge."]}, {"page": "Thornber, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve Thornber"]}, {"page": "Thornber", "response": ["*Steve Thornber (born 1965), British footballer"]}]}}
