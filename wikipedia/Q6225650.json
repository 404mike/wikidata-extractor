As early as 19 April, letter writer John Chamberlain communicated that \"the great clamor against undertakers [was] well quieted\", and the Commons were occupied with a familiar controversy: impositions. Parliament adjourned on 20 April for Easter, reconvening on 2 May. Two days later on 4 May, the king delivered a speech to the Commons, ardent in its defense of the legality of impositions, a fact the king's judges had apparently assured him of beyond any doubt. At the end he added portentously that, if he did not receive supply soon, the Commons \"must not look for more Parliaments in haste\". However, at the same time, the Commons were united and unflinching in their belief that impositions threatened property law, and that, over impositions, \"the liberty of the kingdom is in question.\" James was so irritated by one such speech, given by MP Thomas Wentworth, that he had Wentworth imprisoned shortly after Parliament ended. As Parliamentary historian Conrad Russell judged it, \"both sides were so firmly convinced that they were legally in the right that they never fully absorbed that the other party thought differently.\" Any understanding between the two sides was further hampered by the fact that the Commons continued to disregard the king's financial troubles, which discouraged the king from giving up such a valuable source of income as impositions.", "However, James was in no position to give up such a source of income. While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to prorogue rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament. Shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, the Count of Gondomar, to be assured of Spanish support after his break with Parliament, an assurance which Gondomar happily supplied. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. The aims of Northampton's factions were finally fulfilled, as Northampton saw the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died. The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with royal assent, and thus was not constitutionally considered a Parliament. Contemporaries spoke of it as a \"convention\". For John Chamberlain it seemed \"rather a parlee only\".

Stewart, Cradle King, 248. at the age of eighteen: \"To Mr Peake for pictures and frames \u00a312; two great pictures of the Prince in arms at length sent beyond the seas \u00a350; and to him for washing, scouring and dressing of pictures and making of frames \u00a320.4s.0d\".Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 154. The relatively high price for the two pictures of the prince in arms (armour) may have been due to the use of gold or silver on the details.  Peake is listed in the accounts for Henry's funeral under \"Artificers and officers of the Works\" as \"Mr Peake the elder painter\".  For the occasion, he was allotted seven yards of mourning cloth, plus four for a servant. Also listed is \"Mr Peake the younger painter\", meaning Robert's son William, who was allotted four yards of mourning cloth.Edmond, Hilliard & Oliver, 155.", "Peake's portrait of Lady Elizabeth Pope may have been commissioned by her husband, Sir William Pope, to commemorate their marriage in 1615. Lady Elizabeth is portrayed with her hair loose, a symbol of bridal virginity.Brides of the time are often described as appearing \"in their hair\". For example, John Chamberlain wrote to Alice Carleton that Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset, was \"married in her hair\" to her second husband Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, having recently divorced her first husband, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, on the grounds of his impotence. Letter to Alice Carleton, 13 December 1613. Chamberlain Letters, 116.\u2022 See also Stewart, Cradle King, 113. She wears a draped mantle\u2014embroidered with seed pearls in a pattern of ostrich plumes\u2014and a matching turban. The mantle knotted on one shoulder was worn in Jacobean court masques, as the costume designs of Inigo Jones indicate. The painting's near-nudity, however, makes the depiction of an actual masque costume unlikely.Chirelstein, \"Lady Elizabeth Pope: The Heraldic Body\", in Renaissance Bodies, 36\u201359.\u2022 Ribeiro, Fashion and Fiction, 89. Loose hair and the classical draped mantle also figure in contemporary personifications of abstract concepts in masques and paintings. Yale art historian Ellen Chirelstein argues that Peake is portraying Lady Elizabeth as a personification of America, since her father, Sir Thomas Watson, was a major shareholder in the Virginia Company.Chirelstein, \"Lady Elizabeth Pope: The Heraldic Body\", in Renaissance Bodies, 36\u201359."]}, {"page": "Paul's walk", "response": ["The letter writer John Chamberlain (1553\u20131626) walked to St. Paul's each day to gather news on behalf of his correspondents. His main purpose in his letters was to relate news of events in the capital to his friends, especially those posted on the continent, such as Ralph Winwood and Dudley Carleton, who both spent much of their political careers at the Hague.Carleton was also posted for long periods to Venice. Chamberlain proved the perfect source for Carleton and others because of his willingness to \"walk Paul's\" for the news. He was made a member of a commission to refurbish St. Paul's but was cynical about its chances. He wrote that the king was \"very earnest to set it forward, and they begin hotly enough\" but feared it would prove \"as they say, Paul's work\".Notestein, Four Worthies, 106.", "*Lee, Maurice, Jr., ed.

He matriculated at King's College, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, in 1580, and took his M.A. degree in 1586.

Wood stated that Harriot, Hues and Warner were Northumberland's \"constant companions, and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland's Three Magi.

According to the letter writer John Chamberlain, Northumberland refused a pardon offered to him in 1617, preferring to remain with Harriot, Hues and Warner.: see Kargon, \"The Wizard Earl and the New Science\" in Atomism in England, pp. 5\u201317 at 16. However, the fact that these companions of Northumberland were his \"Three Magi\" studying with him in the Tower of London has been regarded as a romanticisation by the antiquarian John Aubrey and disputed for lack of evidence., critiqued by Shirley, Thomas Harriot, pp. 364\u2013365. See  Hues was tutor to Northumberland's sons: first Algernon Percy, who subsequently became the 10th Earl of Northumberland, at Oxford where he matriculated at Christ Church in 1617; and later Algernon's younger brother Henry in 1622\u20131623. Hues lived at Christ Church at this time, but may have occasionally attended upon Northumberland at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex, and at Syon House in London after the latter's release from the Tower in 1622. Hues sometimes met Walter Warner in London, and they are known to have discussed the reflection of bodies."]}, {"page": "Nicholas Stone", "response": ["Stone owed his early success in London in part to Inigo Jones, the King's Surveyor.
