February 23, 1689 \u2013 April 26, 1717), later known as \"Black Sam\" Bellamy, was an English Sailor, turned pirate, who operated in the early 18th century. He is best known as the wealthiest pirate in recorded history, and one of the faces of the Golden Age of Piracy. Though his known career as a pirate captain lasted little more than a year, he and his crew captured at least 53 ships. Called \"Black Sam\" in Cape Cod folklore because he eschewed the fashionable powdered wig in favor of tying back his long black hair with a simple band, Bellamy became known for his mercy and generosity toward those he captured on his raids. This reputation earned him another nickname, the \"Prince of Pirates\".  He likened himself to Robin Hood, with his crew calling themselves \"Robin Hood's Men\".", "Johnson attributes these speeches to \"Captain Bellamy\" without naming Samuel Bellamy specifically; other writers like Philip Gosse attribute the speeches to Charles Bellamy, a separate pirate unrelated to Samuel Bellamy. They operated at the same time in the same areas and their exploits are often conflated.", "Captain Samuel Bellamy, now known as Black Bellamy, was well known to his contemporaries and chroniclers as a distinctive figure, a tall, strong, well-mannered and very tidy man. He liked expensive clothes, especially black coats. His favorite weapons were four duelling pistols that he always carried in his sash:", "thumb|left|Samuel Bellamy, Wreck of the Whydah, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835027", "* In the manga One Piece, the pirate character Bellamy the Hyena is named after Samuel Bellamy.", "* The Way of the Pirates, \"Famous Pirate: Samuel Bellamy, The Romantic Pirate\""]}]}}
