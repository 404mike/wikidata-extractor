The decision to form a society of this nature had been taken one year earlier in Antwerp, Belgium. A group of museum curators and photographic historians from six European countries - notably Laurent Roosens (of the Sterckshof Museum, Antwerp), Margaret Harker (the UK's Royal Photographic Society) and Rolf Krauss (German Society for Photography) - came together to establish a new society dealing with the history of photography in a European context.", "*Editorial: Margaret Harker Farrand, Roy Green (UK).", "*Editorial board: Margaret Harker Farrand, Roy Green, Anthony Hamber, Sidney F.

Yet the production of a bibliography of articles on the history of photography from current serials had been of undoubted value and a justified function of the ESHPh. After a lapse of two years, a new volunteer - R. Derek Wood (historian of early photography) - from its members in England was found to compile and edit a renewed bibliography.
