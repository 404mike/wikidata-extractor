His career ended after he was imprisoned for downloading child pornography in 1999, and was subsequently convicted of child sexual abuse and attempted rape in 2006 and 2015. \nAfter performing under the name Paul Raven in the 1960s, he changed his stage name to Gary Glitter in the glam rock era of the early 1970s, with a sustained solo UK chart run of hits including \"Rock and Roll, Parts 1 and 2\", \"Do You Wanna Touch Me\", \"I Love You Love Me Love\", \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\", and \"Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again\".  He became known for his extreme glam image of glitter suits, make-up and platform boots, and his energetic live performances. He sold over 20 million records, had 26 hit singles which spent a total of 180 weeks in the UK Singles Chart; twelve reaching the Top 10, with three charting at number-one. He is listed in the Top 100 UK most successful chart acts.  Glitter's popularity waned in the late 1970s, followed by a successful comeback as a solo artist again from the 1980s. His 1984 song \"Another Rock and Roll Christmas\" is one of the most played Christmas hits of all time. In 1998, his recording of \"Rock and Roll\" was listed as one of the top 1,001 songs in music history. Glitter also released seven studio albums, and at least fifteen compilation or live albums.\nThe BBC described Glitter's fall from grace as \"dramatic\" and \"spectacular\". The late 1990s saw his image become irreparably tarnished, following his 1997 arrest and 1999 conviction and imprisonment in the United Kingdom for downloading thousands of items of child pornography. He was also charged at the same time, but acquitted, of sexual activity with an underage girl in the 1970s. Later, Glitter faced criminal charges and deportation from several countries in connection with actual and suspected child sexual abuse. He was deported from Cambodia on suspected child sexual abuse charges in 2002. After he settled in Vietnam, a Vietnamese court found him guilty of obscene acts with minors in 2006. After serving his sentence, Glitter was deported back to the UK where he was placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life. In October 2012, he was arrested again as part of Operation Yewtree. He was released on bail, but was eventually charged, in June 2014, with historical child sex offences. On 5 February 2015, he was found guilty of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault, and one of having sex with a girl under the age of 13 between 1975 and 1980. On 27 February 2015, he was sentenced to a total of 16 years in prison.  He was described by Alexis Petridis of The Guardian as a \"public hate figure\". His performances on the BBC's Top of the Pops are not repeated.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Disco", "response": ["In 1974, there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom.

In 2005, Clifford paid damages to settle defamation proceedings brought by Neil and Christine Hamilton after he represented Nadine Milroy-Sloane, who was later found to have falsely accused the pair of sexual assault. Also in 2005, he told reporters that he would not represent Michael Jackson after he was found not guilty of child abuse charges, saying: \"It would be the hardest job in PR after [representing] Saddam Hussein\". Following the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, but prior to his arrest, Clifford claimed that dozens of \"big name stars\" contacted him and feared they would become implicated in the scandal; he claimed that in the 1960s and 70s they \"never asked for anybody's birth certificate\" before having sex."]}, {"page": "Hartford Whalers", "response": ["Unlike most sports teams at any level the Whalers' had an official theme song entitled \"Brass Bonanza\", a tune composed and arranged by Jacques Ysaye (under the pseudonym of Jack Say) and originally called \"Evening Beat\". The song was a big hit with the team, Whalers fans, and even fans of other NHL teams and was played at home games when the Whalers entered the rink for warmups and also after they scored a goal. It was introduced in the mid-1970s on the B side of a souvenir record of team radio-broadcast highlights while they were still named the New England Whalers and playing in the WHA. However, in 1992, then-general manager Brian Burke cancelled the use of the song because he said \"there were players who were embarrassed by it\", and replaced it with a goal horn and the song \"Hot, Hot, Hot\" by Buster Poindexter, then a year later, \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Gary Glitter. While the goal horn is still used by the Hurricanes today, \"Brass Bonanza\" was quickly reintroduced after Burke left the team the following year. The song is still very popular with Hartford crowds and continues to occasionally be played at XL Center events, including at Hartford Wolf Pack/Connecticut Whale games from 2011 to 2013 and at the University of Connecticut's basketball and men's ice hockey games. The song plays whenever a player on the city's minor-league baseball team, the Hartford Yard Goats, hits a home run. It was also previously used by the Whalers' AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Whalers, the Danbury Whalers of the Federal Hockey League (FHL), and Quinnipiac University's men's and women's ice hockey teams. It has also been played at Fenway Park in Boston during Boston Red Sox games in between innings for several years. Rock bands have been known to play the song during shows in Connecticut, most notably The Zambonis. The song was played when the Carolina Hurricanes scored a goal on an event called heritage night where the Hurricanes dressed in Whalers attire. The Florida Everblades, a former affiliate of the Hurricanes in the ECHL, play the song after every home game at Hertz Arena. The song has now been adopted by the city's soccer team, Hartford Athletic, and by the Premier Hockey Federation's\u00a0Connecticut Whale, being played after goals scored by the teams."]}, {"page": "Another One Bites the Dust", "response": ["# \"Rock and Roll (Part 2) (Dutch Remix)\" (instrumental) (performed by Gary Glitter) \u2013 3:51"]}, {"page": "Hulk Hogan", "response": ["Bollea released a music CD, Hulk Rules, as Hulk Hogan and The Wrestling Boot Band.

Concocting a scheme for a hip-hop record on New Year's Day 1987, Drummond needed a like-minded collaborator with expertise in current music technology, and so contacted Cauty.
