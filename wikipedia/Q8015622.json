He was the son of Edward Adolphus Seymour Mignon and Margaret Bridget (n\u00e9e Campbell).\nBorn in England he emigrated to Grenada in the West Indies in the 1890s. Being in Grenada his opportunities to play in big cricket matches were limited.\nHe was described before the 1900 tour as \"The best amateur bowler in the West Indies. He gets on a lot of work both ways, and uses his head a good deal. He generally bowls a medium pace, but he has a very fast ball up his sleeve. As a batsman, often makes runs, and fields well, especially at slip. As hard as nails, and can bowl all day\". On the tour he took 30 wickets at an average of just under 30. Besides the two professional bowlers he was the most heavily used but his bowling was regarded as \"very disappointing\" perhaps because \"at the start of the trip he was by no means fit\". His batting also proved a disappointment. He took 5-162 against Gloucestershire and eventually took the wicket of Gilbert Jessop after his rapid innings. His best bowling was the 10 wickets he took against Lancashire.\nHis only first-class appearances were for AB St Hill's combined team which toured Trinidad in 1898-99 and 1900-01.\nHe had played for Grenada against Lord Hawke's team in 1896-97 where he impressed taking 6-44 for St. George's C.C. against the tourists. He also played for the combined Grenada/St. Vincent team in Grenada against Bennett's side in 1901-02. In the first match against Bennett's team he took 5-70 in the only innings of the English side bowling alongside Richard Ollivierre. In the second match he added 53 for the last wicket with O.C. Arthur, after the combined side had been reduced to 67-9, although they still lost heavily.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1900", "response": ["In reply the Minor Counties made 261 with Tommie Burton taking 6/55. Batting again the West Indians were in trouble but with 68 from Fitz Hinds and 30s from Percy Cox and William Bowring they set a target of 116. The Minor Counties were then dismissed for just 54 with Float Woods (4/31), Burton (3/11) and William Mignon (2/5) doing all the bowling and giving the tourists their first victory.", "On the second day Gloucestershire were all out for 619. Burton's figures of 5/68 in 25 overs look impressive but he had taken 3 wickets before lunch on the first day and took 2 tail-enders wickets on the second day and had not bowled when the runs were being piled on. William Mignon took 5/162, dismissing Wrathall, Townsend and Jessop, but Charles Ollivierre with 0/137 and Woods with 0/141 really suffered. Fitz Hinds did no better with 0/72 in just 8 overs.", "Learmond and Mignon replaced Goodman and Livingston. Warner lost the toss but Lancashire were dismissed for 187 with William Mignon taking 6/44. Henry Cudworth, who only placed a single first-class match in his career, scored 102 in 2 hours. In reply the tourists scored 174 with Charles Ollivierre scoring 44. Johnny Briggs was rested and did not bowl.", "The tourists kept the same side and Sproston again won the toss and batted. Percy Cox scored 76 and Stanley Sproston scored 118 in 110 minutes, the two adding over 100 for the 5th wicket. William Mignon joined Sproston for the last wicket and despite making only 1* helped Sproston take his score from 64 to 118 and the West Indies to 265. Cecil Holden made 86 for Liverpool but Tommie Burton and Cox took 5 wickets each to give the tourists a first innings lead of 47. There had been no play at all on the second day."]}, {"page": "National Cricket Stadium (Grenada)", "response": ["The National Cricket Stadium, is the name of a cricket stadium complex on River Road, Grenada in the Caribbean.

In 1910, Grenada played in the inaugural Cork Windward Islands Challenge Cup, with the team participating in that tournament until 1939. There is a long gap between 1939 and Grenada's next recorded appearance, which came in the 1965 Windward Islands Tournament against St Vincent. By this time the Windward Islands were playing matches which held first-class status, with Queen's Park playing host to the team's inaugural first-class fixture in 1959 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. Grenada continued to play in the Windward Islands Tournament, and from 1975 its successor, the Heineken Trophy. Their participation in the tournament (under various names) continued into the 1990s, with home matches throughout this period being held at the old Queen's Park."]}, {"page": "Mignon, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Mignon"]}, {"page": "Mignon (name)", "response": ["* William Mignon (1874\u20131965), West Indian cricketer"]}, {"page": "Queen's Park (1887)", "response": ["The Queen's Park was a cricket stadium on River Road, Grenada.
