Joshua started cotton spinning in a small way, but by his exertions and those of his sons Fielden Brothers grew to be one of the largest cotton manufacturers in England. According to William Cobbett in 1832 they were involved in spinning weaving and printing and employing over 2500 persons.  Cobbett also stressed that the brothers were \"famed for their goodness to every creature who is in their employ ...let others do what they may, these gentlemen have preferred a little profit, and even no profit, to great gains from half starvation of the people from whose labour they derive those gains\"", "By 1847, Fielden was in poor health.  Soon after his defeat at Oldham, he retired from business and (officially) from politics, moving from Todmorden to Skeynes Park  near Edenbridge, Kent .  Skeynes was convenient for London, and when problems emerged with implementation of the Ten-Hour Act and its potential circumvention by adoption of a relay system Fielden became involved in repeated lobbying of the Prime Minister and Home Secretary.  These continued exertions on behalf of the millworkers were said to have hastened his death, aged 65, in May 1849.  Fielden's children consequently took a poor view of the Compromise Act of 1850 (which retroceded some of the gains of their father's Ten Hours Act in order to end the relay system), and of Lord Shaftesbury who had forced the Compromise Act upon the Ten-Hour movement, thus (in the Fieldens' eyes) betraying the cause for which their father had given everything for two decades.Letter from Joshua Fielden 21 May 1869 printed as "]}, {"page": "Eastern West Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Joshua Fielden"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Joshua Fielden"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1868 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Joshua Fielden"]}, {"page": "Thomas Fielden (politician)", "response": ["He was born at Todmorden, Lancashire, in 1854, eldest son of Joshua Fielden.
