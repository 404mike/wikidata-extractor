Foyle was dismissed in November 2007, and his successor, Lee Sinnott, proved unable to prevent the club from being relegated into League Two after a 23rd-place finish and also oversaw a defeat to Southern League Division One Midlands club Chasetown in the FA Cup. Sinnott was sacked in September 2008 and following an unsuccessful tenure from Dean Glover, Micky Adams was appointed as the club's new manager in June 2009. Adams left the club in December 2010 with Vale second in the table and Jim Gannon was selected to finish the promotion job. However, Gannon's turbulent reign ended after 74 days. Adams returned as manager at the end of the 2010\u201311 campaign, but this was not enough to placate fans who demanded a change in the boardroom after a series of promised investments failed to come to fruition.", "The record for the most appearances for Port Vale is held by Roy Sproson, who played 842 matches in all competitions. Sproson also holds the record for the most league appearances for the club, with 760. His nephew, Phil Sproson, made 500 appearances in all competitions.

In terms of the backstage staff, he brought in former Port Vale boss Martin Foyle as first-team coach and several members of staff were told that they had no future at The Racecourse. With the new players introduced Wrexham went a run of six matches unbeaten, which included victories against promotion candidates Darlington and Milton Keynes Dons and a 0\u20130 draw against Peterborough United. However, in the final months of the season many of Little's new players had become injured and Wrexham suffered several defeats against fellow strugglers in the league and were also defeated 3\u20130 in a derby match against Shrewsbury Town.

He resigned as manager on 13 April 2011, and was replaced by Tamworth legend Dale Belford, who was to manage the club for the remaining four games of the season. Belford led Tamworth to last day safety with a 2\u20131 home win over Forest Green Rovers, with Jake Sheridan scoring the all important winning goal.  Belford stepped aside at the end of the season, and the search for a new manager to lead the club for the 2011\u201312 Conference Premier season began, speculation was rife, and the names of former York City manager Martin Foyle, Eastwood Town manager Paul Cox and former Walsall assistant manager Martin O'Connor were all linked to the club, but on 25 May 2011, Tamworth announced Kettering Town manager Marcus Law as the club's new manager."]}, {"page": "Southport F.C.", "response": ["To the consternation of the fans, Coleman was not retained as manager; instead the Board appointed Martin Foyle formerly the manager of Hereford United. A number of first team players left the club at the end of the season (including several who had been on loan) leaving Foyle with a major rebuilding task for the 2014\u201315 season.  Foyle was dismissed in October 2014 and replaced by Gary Brabin who returned to the club for his second spell as manager. Despite a run in the FA Cup culminating in a spirited third round defeat to Championship side Derby County, Brabin's spell was short lived, accepting an academy role with Everton. Paul Carden, previously assistant to Brabin, became manager and was joined by Alex Russell as assistant manager, son of the club legend of the same name.

The loss of close to \u00a31 million of talent showed on the pitch, as Oxford ended the 1991\u201392 season one place and two points ahead of relegated Plymouth Argyle. They secured their safety with a final day win over Tranmere Rovers. At the end of the season he gave Steve McClaren his first job in management, putting him in charge of Oxford's youth-team. There was less drama in 1992\u201393, as his side finished in 14th-place, seven points above the relegation zone. Over the summer he paid Corby Town \u00a320,000 for striker Matt Murphy, and sold Andy Melville on to Sunderland for \u00a3500,000.", "In order to help the Vale to avoid relegation at the end of the 1998\u201399 season, Horton brought in five players: Dave Brammer (Manchester City), Tony Butler (Blackpool), Carl Griffiths (Leyton Orient), Alex Smith (Chester City), and Chris Allen (Nottingham Forest). This spending spree set the club back \u00a3630,000, and so Horton first sold off Peter Beadle to Notts County for \u00a3250,000 in order to raise the cash needed for his new signings. He won his first game in charge, a 2\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town, thanks to a brace from Martin Foyle. A five-game unbeaten run in April allowed the Vale to finish above relegated Bury on goals scored.", "In a bid to survive another season in the First Division, Horton allowed ten players to leave Vale Park; the most significant departure was Neil Aspin, as the 34-year-old dropped down two divisions as his career wound down. To replace these players, Horton signed three players on free transfers: Jeff Minton from former club Brighton, Tommy Widdrington from Grimsby Town, and Steve Rimmer from Manchester City. As the season progressed he released Marcus Bent, and sold Carl Griffiths back to Leyton Orient for \u00a3100,000. He further sold highly rated young centre-back Anthony Gardner to Tottenham Hotspur for \u00a31 million, and sold Tony Butler to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a3140,000. In their place he signed Micky Cummins, Mark Goodlad, Sagi Burton, and Ville Viljanen; and also took Martin Bullock, Gareth Taylor, and David Healy in on loan.

Doherty signed for Accrington Stanley shortly thereafter, but only played twenty league games and scored once (against Grimsby Town), before he was released a year later.

He was sent off on his debut in a 1\u20130 win over Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road on 20 March \u2013 the first red card of his career \u2013 after kicking Adrian Whitbread in retaliation for a bad challenge. He scored his first goal for the \"Valiants\" with a 25-yard volley in a 4\u20130 win over Wigan Athletic at Springfield Park on 17 April. Four days later he scored the only goal of the game in the Football League Trophy southern area final second leg match with Exeter City at St James Park to secure Vale a place in the final.

He went on to provid the cross for Martin Foyle to score the winning goal past Stockport County in the play-off semi-finals. Stockport County were also Vale's opponents in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley on 22 May, and Slaven managed to set up Paul Kerr for Vale's first goal before scoring the second decisive goal of a 2\u20131 victory. Ironically it was Sky TV's match summariser, Lennie Lawrence, who was tasked with naming Slaven as the man of the match just two months after letting him go on a free transfer. Eight days later he featured again at Wembley in the play-off Final, which ended in a 3\u20130 defeat to West Bromwich Albion."]}, {"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["Delighted with his team, he made few changes in preparation for the 1990\u201391 campaign. Vale once again finished comfortably in mid-table. \u00a380,000 was spent on Dutch midfielder Robin van der Laan, over the next five years he would become a key player. In June 1992, Rudge again broke the club's transfer record, picking up striker Martin Foyle for \u00a3375,000 from Oxford United. Foyle would be a dominant figure at the club throughout the 1990s. The money for these acquisitions came from the sale of midfield dynamo Robbie Earle to Wimbledon."]}]}}
