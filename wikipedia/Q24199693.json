Robilliard did not have any formal training as a painter, but he had started writing poetry and making drawings in Guernsey. However, there are no traces of these early poems and drawings: according to Lester Queripel in a letter to Gilbert & George dated 12 November 1988, he consistently destroyed his work as he did not want to be called a \"sissy\" by his friends.Letter from Lester Queripel to Gilbert & George, 12.11.88 In London, he lived in the Shoreditch area, and shared a studio with Andrew Heard from 1983 onwards. The artist was also his partner. He frequented the London club and pub scene, a familiar presence in places such as Blitz, where Andrew Heard worked in the 1970s, Heaven and the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, The Bell in King's Cross and the French House in Soho.", "David Robilliard pursued his career in poetry during his early years in London. His work was supported by Gilbert & George who also encouraged Robilliard to associate images to his written work. They published his first poetry volume, Inevitable, in 1984. His first exhibition of drawings in the same year, at the Stephen Bartley Gallery, was originally only meant as a backdrop to the book's launch. Stephen Bartley describes the way the exhibition developed: \"the exhibition was conceived at short notice in collaboration with Andrew Heard, most of the drawings (other than those used in the books) were done in the two weeks before the show. I suggested that David and Andrew hire a few frames so that the drawings could be hung as a backdrop to the party. I was amazed when they produced some 40 pieces and mounted a professional show. Everything was priced at \u00a375, no catalogue was produced because we were concentrating on the book. One sale to Anthony d'Offay resulted. (...) The exhibition was taken down the day after as the frames had to be returned.\" On the invitation card for the exhibition, Gilbert & George described Robilliard as \"the new master of the modern person. Looking, thinking, feeling, seeing, bitching \u2013 he brilliantly encapsulates the 'Existers' spirit of our time.\"", "From 1984 onwards, almost all of the 58 paintings he produced between 1987 and 1988 were portraits. They are portraits of anonymous people he observed as well as acquaintances and fellow artists such as Andrew Heard, Gilbert & George and Duggie Fields."]}, {"page": "Heard, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Heard"]}]}}
