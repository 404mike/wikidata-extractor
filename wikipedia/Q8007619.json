Described as a man of intense purpose, Reverend Rudland brought simplicity, humility, and a focus on realism to those he met. Rising above a difficult beginning, he pragmatically tackled obstacles keeping his focus on stretching his hand out in friendship to the Chinese people. His organization, supervision, and a firm belief in native ministry built a single church in Taizhou, Zhejiang,China, into thirty-one outstations and baptized almost two thousand converts in twenty-eight years.  He translated the New Testament and most of the Old Testament into a Romanized Taizhou dialect. He supervised the printing and oversaw distribution for several thousand documents in the local dialect. Reverend Rudland brought new technology to the press room which improved quality and quantity.  He served as printing supervisor for the other mission districts as well.  The British & Foreign Bible Society appointed him Honorary Governor for Life in 1911. Reverend William Rudland was the last surviving adult member of the Lammermuir Party before his death in 1912.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Protestant missionaries in China", "response": ["| William David Rudland"]}, {"page": "Lammermuir Party", "response": ["* William David Rudland, Little Eversden, Blacksmith.

They were born in Great Waltham, Essex, the twin daughters of William Bell (a local shoemaker) and his wife Sophia (n\u00e9e Collins). The family were raised as members of the Little Waltham Independent Congregational Church. Mary travelled to China as a member of the Lammermuir Party in 1866 and subsequently married William David Rudland, a fellow missionary and member of the CIM. Annie followed her sister to China a year and a half later, sailing on the Clipper Taitsing. She subsequently married Edward Fishe, also a fellow missionary with the CIM. Both Mary and Annie worked alongside their husbands in the various mission stations where they were based. They gave Bible classes to the local women and established and ran schools for local children. Their work was instrumental not only in spreading the gospels, but crucially, in establishing and building trust within the local communities."]}]}}
