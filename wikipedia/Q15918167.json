Their three silvers and a bronze at the Winter Paralympics made them the most successful female British Winter Paralympians of all time, and the first Britons to win four medals at one Paralympics. Because of her success at the 2014 Paralympics, Etherington was the British flagbearer at the 2014 Winter Paralympics closing ceremony.\nEtherington has only five percent vision in both eyes and competes in the visually impaired category. Because of her impairment she requires a sighted guide, Caroline Powell. The pair have competed together since August 2013. After asking for a new guide through Facebook and after two other applicants pulled out, Etherington and Powell combined in April 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sport in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The United Kingdom has played a major role in the development of disability sport.
