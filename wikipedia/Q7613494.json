As a player, he made more than 200 appearances in the Football League.\nO'Shaughnessy or \"Shaughssa\" as he is affectionately known was born in Wrexham and started his career as an apprentice at Leeds United, before moving onto Bradford City, where he made one league appearance.In 1988, O'Shaughnessy was signed by former Leeds United midfielder and manager Eddie Gray for Rochdale. In three seasons at Spotland, O'Shaughnessy enjoyed arguably the most successful spell in his career scoring 16 goals in 109 League appearances and reaching the 5th Round of the 1990 FA Cup . During this time, O'Shaughnessy earned the nickname the \"Master Blaster\" for his skill at taking long distance free-kicks.\nIn July 1991, O'Shaughnessy joined Exeter City for \u00a310,000. After a disappointing three-game spell at St James Park under 1966 FIFA World Cup winner Alan Ball, which saw him sent off at Huddersfield Town, O'Shaughnessy joined Darlington in January 1992.\nIn 88 League appearances for the Quakers, Steve became team captain before being released at the end of the 1993\u201394 season, with his final Football League appearance coming on 7 May 1994 against Bury.After this, Steve went to a roundabout of clubs, including Stalybridge Celtic and Buler Rangers in Hong Kong, before returning to play in the League of Wales.\nIn 153 League of Wales appearances, O'Shaughnessy played for Inter Cardiff, Barry Town, Holywell Town, Rhyl, Caernarfon Town, T.N.S. Llansantfraid, Bangor City, Oswestry Town and NEWI Cefn Druids.\nIn 1999, O'Shaughnessy was appointed player-manager of Oswestry Town.On 27 September 2006, O'Shaughnessy was named as the new manager of Caernarfon Town.In June 2008, O'Shaughnessy left Caernarfon Town and joined Connah's Quay Nomads as manager, but left the club after one season in charge.After serving as assistant, he was appointed as manager of Airbus UK Broughton in November 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cefn Druids A.F.C.", "response": ["After the appointment of ex-Rochdale midfielder Steve O'Shaughnessy in the summer of 2001, the Ancients experienced their best results since the halcyon Welsh Cup days of the late 19th century and early 20th century."]}, {"page": "Oswestry Town F.C.", "response": ["*Steve O'Shaughnessy (1999\u20132001)"]}, {"page": "Caernarfon Town F.C.", "response": ["Manager Adrian Jones guided the team through this deserved success, and off the field a new stand and changing facilities were finally completed early in 2001.

By early 2004, the Canaries were in contention for a top eight spot, but surprisingly decided to part company with manager Adie Jones after more than three years at the helm. Former Wrexham midfielder Wayne Phillips took the job in a caretaker role and continued on a permanent player/manager basis in 2004\u201305, but results did not really improve over his two seasons in charge and he stepped down in June 2007, to be replaced by former Oswestry Town and Cefn Druids manager Steve O'Shaughnessy.
