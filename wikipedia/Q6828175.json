A right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler, he started his cricket career at Northamptonshire, who finished in fourth position in the County Championship in his debut season, 1956. Allen debuted against Worcestershire in May and played in more than half the matches in the season. In 1957, Allen moved into a regular first-team place and finished high in the bowling averages, as Northamptonshire finished second in the County Championship table.During the early part of 1958, Allen played two matches for Marylebone Cricket Club. He played for Northamptonshire throughout the 1958 County Championship season, where, once again, the team played strongly, finishing in fourth position in the table. In 1959, with the emergence of the leg-spin bowler Peter Watts, he played less often in the first team.The retirement of the spin bowlers George Tribe at the end of the 1959 season and Jack Manning in 1960 gave Allen more opportunities and he played consistently for Northamptonshire until the end of the 1963 season. Northamptonshire finished seventh in the 1963 County Championship table, an improvement on their second-bottom table showing the previous season.Allen moved to Derbyshire for the opening of the 1964 season, debuting against Glamorgan in a rain-affected match. Wisden credited Allen as a factor in Derbyshire's improvement that season from 17th and last to 12th place in the Championship. He represented Derbyshire for two more years, before quitting first-class cricket.Allen was a consistent bowler, accruing five-wicket bowling hauls in eight individual seasons, and securing ten wickets in an individual match three times. He was a lower-order batsman during his Northamptonshire career, switching to the tailend on occasion while playing for Derbyshire.Allen died at Lancaster on 6 October 1995 aged 62.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancaster, Lancashire", "response": ["*Michael Allen (1933\u20131995) \u2013 international cricketer, died in Lancaster."]}, {"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["After the Second World War, things could only get better for Northamptonshire and they started by recruiting widely from other counties and countries, bringing in Freddie Brown from Surrey; the Australians Jock Livingston, George Tribe and Jack Manning; the New Zealander Peter Arnold; and the Cambridge University opening bat and leg-spinner Raman Subba Row.

Kelleher took just 44 wickets in 22 matches and his bowling average, 26.90, contrasted with the county's other bowlers, all of whom averaged less than 20 runs per wicket. In 1958, he played in three early matches, but took only one wicket, and lost his place in the attack to Albert Lightfoot, who supplemented his occasional bowling with useful batting, a skill Kelleher never aspired to.

In fact, in his first match of the season, against Warwickshire, he was the fourth spin bowler called on after Tribe, Manning and slow left-arm spinner Michael Allen, but took five wickets for just 30 runs, all five wickets coming in a spell of 53 balls at a cost of just 10 runs.
