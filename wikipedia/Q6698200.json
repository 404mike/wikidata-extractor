Jamie later suspects that one of Phil's two archenemies, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), is the culprit when he becomes involved in their dangerous feud \u2013 up to the point where Dan begins to extort money from Jamie in his revenge against Phil, while Steve begins clashing with Jamie over the escalating situation. Billy, who is working for Steve as his errand boy, learns about Jamie's struggle and taunts him about it until Jamie overpowers Billy in the snooker club and forces him to submit. Moreover, Jamie ends up sharing his theory with Steve's wife and Dan's former girlfriend Mel Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). By the time Phil has recovered, it is revealed that the shooter was in fact his ex-girlfriend and Mel's best-friend Lisa Shaw (Lucy Benjamin). He doesn't tell Jamie about this, however, and the two resolve to implicate Dan and Steve behind the shooting in order to rid them out of the square for good. Phil sets his plan to frame Dan as the shooter and Steve as an accessory in motion when he contacts Dan's former crime boss, Ritchie Stringer (Gareth Hunt), and lends him Steve's handgun that Lisa used to shoot him; Ritchie later gives Dan the gun under the pretense of being permitted to further extort Phil. Later on that night, Dan threatens Phil at gunpoint and Jamie intervenes when he suspects that something has gone wrong. Dan nearly shoots them until the police arrive and arrest him for shooting Phil. Afterwards, Phil summons his lawyer Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett) and the two advice Jamie to testify against Dan to ensure he gets sent down. Jamie complies and Phil later entraps Steve into conspiring with him against Dan to rid themselves of their common enemy. However, their plan fails when Dan is found not guilty and he gets revenge on Phil by kidnapping Mel for a \u00a3200,000 ransom \u2013 with Dan also getting revenge on Steve for conspiring with Phil against him and using Mel as leverage to exact his vengeance."]}, {"page": "List of former EastEnders characters", "response": ["| Lisa Fowler || Lucy Benjamin || 1998\u20132003, 2010, 2017, 2019\u20132020"]}]}}
