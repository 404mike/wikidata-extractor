Generally, however, they counter that proposals based on the precautionary principle are often unrealistic and sometimes even counter-productive as opposed to the technogaian current of transhumanism, which they claim is both realistic and productive. In his television series Connections, science historian James Burke dissects several views on technological change, including precautionism and the restriction of open inquiry. Burke questions the practicality of some of these views, but concludes that maintaining the status quo of inquiry and development poses hazards of its own, such as a disorienting rate of change and the depletion of our planet's resources. The common transhumanist position is a pragmatic one where society takes deliberate action to ensure the early arrival of the benefits of safe, clean, alternative technology, rather than fostering what it considers to be anti-scientific views and technophobia."]}, {"page": "Little Ice Age", "response": ["The violinmaker Antonio Stradivari produced his instruments during the Little Ice Age. The colder climate is proposed to have caused the wood that was used in his violins to be denser than in warmer periods and to contribute to the tone of his instruments. According to the science historian James Burke, the period inspired such novelties in everyday life as the widespread use of buttons and button-holes, as well as knitting of custom-made undergarments for the better covering and insulating of the body. Chimneys were invented to replace open fires in the centre of communal halls to allow houses with multiple rooms to have the separation of masters from servants."]}, {"page": "Vaudeville", "response": ["The origin of the term is obscure but often explained as being derived from the French expression voix de ville (\"voice of the city\"). A second speculation is that it comes from the 15th-century songs on satire by poet Olivier Basselin, \"Vau de Vire\". In his Connections television series, science historian James Burke argues that the term is a corruption of the French \"Vau de Vire\" (\"Vire River Valley\", in English), an area known for its bawdy drinking songs and where Basselin lived. The Oxford English Dictionary also endorses the  origin, a truncated form of  (\"song of the Valley of the Vire\"). Around 1610, Jean le Houx collected these works as , which is probably the direct origin of the word. Some, however, preferred the earlier term \"variety\" to what manager Tony Pastor called its \"sissy and Frenchified\" successor. Thus, vaudeville marketed itself as \"variety\" well into the 20th century."]}, {"page": "Cistercians", "response": ["Until the Industrial Revolution, most of the technological advances in Europe were made in the monasteries.  According to the medievalist Jean Gimpel, their high level of industrial technology facilitated the diffusion of new techniques: \"Every monastery had a model factory, often as large as the church and only several feet away, and waterpower drove the machinery of the various industries located on its floor.\"Gimpel, p 67. Cited by Woods. Waterpower was used for crushing wheat, sieving flour, fulling cloth and tanning \u2013 a \"level of technological achievement [that] could have been observed in practically all\" of the Cistercian monasteries.Woods, p 33  The English science historian James Burke examines the impact of Cistercian waterpower, derived from Roman watermill technology such as that of Barbegal aqueduct and mill near Arles in the fourth of his ten-part Connections TV series, called \"Faith in Numbers\". The order used its own numbering system, which could express numbers from 0 to 9999 in a single sign."]}, {"page": "Nitrocellulose", "response": ["Because of its explosive nature, not all applications of nitrocellulose were successful. In 1869, with elephants having been poached to near extinction, the billiards industry offered a US$10,000 prize to whomever came up with the best replacement for ivory billiard balls. John Wesley Hyatt created the winning replacement, which he created with a new material he invented, called camphored nitrocellulose\u2014the first thermoplastic, better known as Celluloid. The invention enjoyed a brief popularity, but the Hyatt balls were extremely flammable, and sometimes portions of the outer shell would explode upon impact. An owner of a billiard saloon in Colorado wrote to Hyatt about the explosive tendencies, saying that he did not mind very much personally but for the fact that every man in his saloon immediately pulled a gun at the sound.Connections, James Burke, Volume 9, \"Countdown\", 29:00\u201331:45, 1978 The process used by Hyatt to manufacture the billiard balls, patented in 1881, involved placing the mass of nitrocellulose in a rubber bag, which was then placed in a cylinder of liquid and heated. Pressure was applied to the liquid in the cylinder, which resulted in a uniform compression on the nitrocellulose mass, compressing it into a uniform sphere as the heat vaporized the solvents. The ball was then cooled and turned to make a uniform sphere. In light of the explosive results, this process was called the \"Hyatt gun method\"."]}, {"page": "Raymond Burr", "response": ["| NBC\u2013BBC co-production for the U.S. Bicentennial, co-hosted by James Burke"]}, {"page": "Guns, Germs, and Steel", "response": ["* James Burke (science historian)"]}, {"page": "Knowledge Web", "response": ["* The Knowledge Web Project supervised by James Burke"]}, {"page": "Maidstone", "response": ["Alumni of the oldest school, Maidstone Grammar School (founded 1549), include James Burke, television presenter, and Lord Beeching, of the British railway cuts of the 1960s.

He was a presenter for the Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 missions, and a commenter, with Cliff Michelmore and James Burke, for BBC television's coverage of the Moon landing missions. Moore could not remember his words at the \"Eagle has landed\" moment, and the BBC has lost the tapes of the broadcast. A homemade recording reveals that the studio team was very quiet during the landing sequence, leaving the NASA commentary clear of interruptions. Some 14 seconds after \"contact\" Burke says \"They've touched\". At 36 seconds he says \"Eagle has landed\". Between 53 and 62 seconds he explains the upcoming stay/no-stay decision and NASA announces the T1 stay at 90 seconds after contact. At 100 seconds the recorded sequence ends.

At Pompeii, most houses had separate kitchens, most fairly small, but a few large; the Villa of the Mysteries covers a nine-by-twelve meter area.Faas, p. 130. A number of kitchens at Pompeii had no roofs, resembling courtyards more than ordinary rooms; this allowed smoke to ventilate. Kitchens that did have roofs must have been extremely smokey, since the only ventilation would come from high windows or holes in the ceiling; while the Romans built chimneys for their bakeries and smithies, they were unknown in private dwellings until about the 12th century A.D, well after the collapse of Roman civilization.Faas, p. 140.James Burke, Connections (Little, Brown and Co.) 1978/1995, , p. 159"]}, {"page": "Chimney", "response": ["Industrial chimney use dates to the Romans, who drew smoke from their bakeries with tubes embedded in the walls.
