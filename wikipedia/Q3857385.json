Clough was keen on the chance to become an international manager, but the directors of Nottingham Forest refused to let him split his loyalties. According to Hamish Woodward writing in Atletifo Sports, Clough used the Wales job to earn himself an improved contract with Nottingham Forest. In April 1986, Clough had declared that he intended to spend the rest of his managerial career with Nottingham Forest. In June 1986, Clough was linked with the job of Scotland manager, but the vacancy was filled by Andy Roxburgh (a long-serving member of the Scotland coaching set-up) instead.
