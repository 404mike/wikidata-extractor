Khorenatsi states that \"aghu\" was a nickname given to Prince Arran, whom the Armenian King Vologases I (Vagharsh I) appointed as governor of northeastern provinces bordering on Armenia. According to a legend reported by Khorenatsi, Arran was a descendant of Sisak, the ancestor of the Siunids of Armenia's province of Syunik, and thus a great-grandson of the ancestral eponym of the Armenians, the Forefather Hayk.Movses Kalankatuatsi.

See:  Roslin may have been an offspring of one of the marriages common between Armenians and Franks (any person originating in Catholic western Europe) that were frequent among the nobility but occurred among the lower classes as well. Roslin also names his brother Anton and asks the readers to recall the names of his teachers in their prayers. thumb|250px|Hromkla was located in the eastern part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.Professor Levon Chookaszian, head of the Chair of UNESCO and Chair of Armenian Art History at Yerevan State University, proposed a more detailed explanation of the appearance of this surname in the Armenian milieu. According to the professor, the surname Roslin originated from Henry Sinclair of the Clan Sinclair, baron of Roslin who accompanied Godfrey of Bouillon in the 1096 Crusade to Jerusalem. Chookaszian's hypothesis is based on the assumption that like most prominent Crusaders of the time,Godfrey\u2019s brother Baldwin married Arda of Armenia, his successor Baldwin of Bourcq married Morphia of Melitene, Joscelin I married Beatrice etc. See:  Sinclair married an Armenian."]}, {"page": "Guenter Lewy", "response": ["Lewy's book The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey: A Disputed Genocide was published in 2006 by University of Utah Press after it was rejected by eleven publishers. In the book, Lewy argues that there is insufficient evidence of the Young Turk regime organizing the massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. In Lewy's view, they have not been proven to have been governmentally organized. About the number of Armenian victims, Lewy argues that it \"can only be estimated, because no death statistics for this period exist\"; calculating the total losses of Ottoman Armenians between 1914 and 1919, Lewy uses the figure of 1,750,000 individuals for the pre-war population in the whole Ottoman Empire, figure used by historians like Charles Dowsett and Malcolm E. Yapp, then estimate the number of survivors in 1919 to around 1,108,000, making an average of several estimations, including the tabulation of George Montgomery (American official in the Paris Peace Conference in charge of Near East) and the figure of the Armenian National Council of Constantinople; so, Lewy estimates the total losses for World War I to around 642,000.Lewy, Guenter, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey, pp. 233\u201340."]}, {"page": "James R.

Initially Hewitt thought that Lithuanian might be the more attractive option. However, as he would need a long-distance adviser for whichever language he selected (Cambridge not having a specialist in either), he contacted Oxford\u2019s Professor of Comparative Slavonic Philology, Robert Auty, for Lithuanian and Oxford\u2019s Professor of Armenian, Charles Dowsett, for Armenian. Prof. Auty proved difficult to reach and by the time his positive response was received, Hewitt had already elected to work on Old Armenian under the general supervision of Alan Sommerstein, but, when the latter moved to Nottingham in 1974, Bernard Comrie took over."]}]}}
