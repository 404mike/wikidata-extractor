Antrim later defeated Kildare in the All-Ireland quarter-final before lining out against Offaly in the penultimate game of the championship. Offaly were the red hot favourites going into the game, however, McNaughton's shocked their opponents and won the game by 4\u201315 to 1\u201315 courtesy of a brace of goals from Olcan McFetridge and another brace from Aidan McCarry. Offaly, in spite of losing, recognised the historic nature of the victory and applauded Antrim while lining up in a guard of honour as the team left the field. On 3 September 1989 Antrim faced Tipperary in a unique All-Ireland final. It was the Glensmen's first championship decider in forty-six years. The game was a one-sided affair from start to finish, with Tipp's Nicky English setting a new scoring record by bagging 2\u201312 in the 4\u201324 to 3\u20139 victory."]}, {"page": "McCarry", "response": ["*Aidan McCarry (born 1963), Irish hurler"]}, {"page": "Tom Conneely", "response": ["In 1981 he won his first championship medal following a defeat of Kinnitty.
