The family were members of the Sandemanian church, one of whose members, Michael Faraday, was a friend of the Deacon family.  Faraday played an important part in the development of Henry junior's life and development. His education was at a Quaker school in Tottenham. He was apprenticed at the age of 14 to the London engineering firm of Galloway & Sons. When this company failed, he joined the business of Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company in their factory at Patricroft, Manchester, on the banks of the Bridgewater Canal. In the 1840s he moved to Pilkington Brothers at St Helens and became manager of their glass-polishing department. While he was there he invented an apparatus for the grinding and smoothing of glass. In 1851 he left to join John Hutchinson, alkali manufacturer, in Widnes.In 1853 Deacon, with Edmond Leyland, filed his first patent, which was for an improved manufacturing process for sulphuric acid. Later that year Deacon left Hutchinson and went into partnership with the younger of the Pilkington brothers, William, to establish their own alkali works in Widnes on land between the Sankey Canal and St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway.  This partnership was dissolved in 1855.  In a new partnership with his previous employer, Holbrook Gaskell who provided the capital, the firm of Gaskell, Deacon and Co was founded. At that time all factories manufacturing alkali were doing so by the Leblanc process.  In 1838 Harrison Grey Dyar and John Henmming patented an ammonia-soda process of making alkali.  Deacon experimented with this process but had no success and Gaskell persuaded him to abandon this project.Between 1854 and 1876 Deacon, alone or in collaboration with others, filed at least 29 patents, all relating to alkali manufacture. Deacon also presented a number of papers to learned societies, including the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1870, the Chemical Society in 1870 and the Warrington Literary and Philosophical Society in 1874.  \nIn 1867 Deacon took on a chemist, Ferdinand Hurter, on a month's probation. In time Hurter was to become the chief chemist to the company. Deacon worked with him to discover an improved method of manufacturing chlorine from hydrochloric acid, a noxious by-product of the Leblanc process, and in 1870 discovered a better process, using copper chloride as a catalyst.Henry Deacon also played a part in public life in Widnes.  He was chairman of the Local Board and played a significant part in establishing the waterworks at Pex Hill.  He was chairman of the first school board in the town.Deacon married Emma Wade from Basford, Nottingham in 1851 with whom he had at least three sons and three daughters. After Emma's death he married Caroline Rutt of Islington, Middlesex, in 1866. They had at least three sons and a daughter. Deacon died in 1876 from typhoid fever at his home in Widnes.  He was survived by his widow, seven sons and four daughters. His estate was in excess of \u00a3100,000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deacon process", "response": ["The Deacon process, invented by Henry Deacon, is a process used during the manufacture of alkalis (the initial end product was sodium carbonate) by the Leblanc process.  Hydrogen chloride gas was converted to chlorine gas, which was then used to manufacture a commercially valuable bleaching powder, and at the same time the emission of waste hydrochloric acid was curtailed.  To some extent this technically sophisticated process superseded the earlier manganese dioxide process.", "The Leblanc-Deacon process is a modification of the Leblanc process.  The Leblanc process was notoriously environmentally unfriendly, and resulted in some of the first Air and Water pollution acts.  In 1874, Henry Deacon had derived a process to reduce HCl emissions as mandated by the Alkali Act.  In this process, hydrogen chloride is oxidized by oxygen over a copper chloride catalyst, resulting in the production of chlorine.  This was widely used in the paper and textile industries as a bleaching agent, and as a result sodium carbonate was no longer the primary product of these plants, and henceforth sold at a loss."]}, {"page": "Holbrook Gaskell", "response": ["In 1855 Gaskell was well enough to enter into a second partnership with the industrial chemist Henry Deacon, who had worked with him in Nasmyth, Gaskell &\u00a0Co.

L. and Mercer, P. J., Spike Island, Halton Borough Council.  This was an ideal site for the factory because all the raw materials could be transported there by the waterways and railway, and the finished products could similarly be transported anywhere else in the country or overseas. Further chemical factories were soon built nearby by entrepreneurs including John McClellan, William Gossage, Frederic Muspratt, Holbrook Gaskell and Henry Deacon.  The town grew rapidly as housing and social provision was made for the factory workers. Soon the villages of Farnworth, Appleton, Ditton and Upton were subsumed within the developing town of Widnes. Woodend became known as West Bank. The substances produced included soap, borax, soda ash, salt cake and bleaching powder. Other industries developed including iron and copper works.  The town became heavily polluted with smoke and the by-products of the chemical processes.  In 1888 the town was described as \"the dirtiest, ugliest and most depressing town in England\"Daily News quoted by  and in 1905 as a \"poisonous hell-town\".Daily Mail quoted in ", "Henry Deacon (1822\u20131876) was a chemist and industrialist who established a chemical factory in Widnes.

Here he became chief chemist and worked with Deacon to develop a process to convert hydrochloric acid, a waste by-product of the Leblanc process of making alkali, to chlorine which was then used to manufacture bleaching powder.  He was a pioneer in applying the principles of physical chemistry and thermodynamics to industrial processes and by 1880 was considered to be a world authority on the manufacture of alkali.  He was a strong defender of the Leblanc process against the other methods of manufacturing alkali being developed at the time although he did research the ammonia-soda process but without any success. He argued against the production of alkali by the electrolysis of brine because of the enormous amount of electrical power this would require although he was later to have second thoughts."]}, {"page": "John Hutchinson (industrialist)", "response": ["In 1848 Hutchinson, at the age of 22, obtained a lease of land in Widnes, where he established his first factory, Hutchinson's No 1 Works.
