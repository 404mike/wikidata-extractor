Read is known as a theatre theorist and cultural activist, with scholarly interests in ethics and the everyday, performed communities, event architecture,  and subjectivities of capitalism.  Read's work stands as a critique of modernist theatrical orthodoxy critically contesting Peter Brook's idealism of the \u2018empty space' awaiting its theatre, a tabula rasa for professionals to enter and exit at will.  Read counter intuitively perceives theatre to have been superseded in that populated place by the quotidian performances of everyday life, those that remain for good and ill. Read took up this provocative critique on the National Theatre stage in London in 1994 in public dialogue with Brook's space-designer Jean-Guy Lecat, and joins others in his scepticism of the colonial fantasy of theatre's \u2018empty space', including most assertively Rustom Bharucha in Theatre & The World (1993).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dartington College of Arts", "response": ["* Alan Read (Writing tutor)"]}, {"page": "Alan Read (Writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Read (writer)"]}, {"page": "Alan Read", "response": ["Alan Read may refer to:", "* Alan Read (writer) (born 1956), writer and professor of theatre", "* Alan Read (activist) (1945\u20131996), canal preservationist"]}]}}
