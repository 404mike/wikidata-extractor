Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform in London, distinguishes between fascism and right-wing nationalist parties which are often described as far right such as the National Front in France. Mudde notes that the most successful European far-right parties in 2019 were \"former mainstream right-wing parties that have turned into populist radical right ones.\" According to historian Mark Sedgwick, \"[t]here is no general agreement as to where the mainstream ends and the extreme starts, and if there ever had been agreement on this, the recent shift in the mainstream would challenge it.\"", "The key thinkers of contemporary far-right politics are claimed by Mark Sedgwick to share four key elements, namely apocalyptism, fear of global elites, belief in Carl Schmitt's friend-enemy distinction and the idea of metapolitics. The apocalyptic strain of thought begins in Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West and is shared by Julius Evola and Alain de Benoist. It continues in The Death of the West by Pat Buchanan as well as in the fears of Islamization of Europe. Related to it is the fear of global elites, who are seen as responsible for the decline. Ernst J\u00fcnger was concerned about rootless cosmopolitan elites while de Benoist and Buchanan oppose the managerial state and Curtis Yarvin is against \"the Cathedral\". Schmitt's friend-enemy distinction has inspired the French Nouvelle Droite idea of ethnopluralism which has become highly influential on the alt-right when combined with American racism.

In this work, Evola described the features of his idealized traditional society in which religious and temporal power were created and united not by priests, but by warriors expressing spiritual power. In mythology, he saw evidence of the West's superiority over the East. Moreover, he claimed that the traditional elite had the ability to access power and knowledge through a hierarchical magic which differed from the lower \"superstitious and fraudulent\" forms of magic. Evola insists that only \"nonmodern forms, institutions, and knowledge\" could produce a \"real renewal ... in those who are still capable of receiving it.\" The text was \"immediately recognized by Mircea Eliade and other intellectuals who allegedly advanced ideas associated with Tradition.\" Eliade was one of the most influential twentieth-century historians of religion, a fascist sympathizer associated with the Romanian Christian right wing movement Iron Guard. Evola was aware of the importance of myth from his readings of Georges Sorel, one of the key intellectual influences on fascism.

Oxford University Press. p. 44.  \"Isis Unveiled was extensively plagiarized from a variety of standard works on occultism and Hermeticism (134 pages from Samuel Dunlap's Sod, the Son of Man, 107 pages from Joseph Ennemoser's History of Magic, and so on).\" Similarly, Geoffrey Ashe notes that Isis Unveiled combines \"comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a m\u00e9lange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism.\"Ashe, Geoffrey (2001). Encyclopedia of Prophecy. ABC-CLIO. p. 251 Indeed, Isis Unveiled makes use of many sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: \"Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas.\" Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines. Modern copies of Isis Unveiled are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences."]}, {"page": "Sarmoung Brotherhood", "response": ["Mark Sedgwick, the coordinator of the Unit for Arab and Islamic Studies at Aarhus University writes:"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Mark Sedgwick (1960\u2013), British historian specializing in Sufism"]}, {"page": "Mark (given name)", "response": ["*Mark Sedgwick (born 1960), British historian"]}, {"page": "The Teachers of Gurdjieff", "response": ["The authors of the Handbook of Islamic Sects and Movements, Muhammad Afzal Upal and Carole M.
