He scored more than 21,000 runs in first-class cricket.\nSmith was born in Somercotes, Derbyshire. He made his debut for Derbyshire in June 1927 against Somerset, when he was out for a duck in the only innings he played and was given a chance to bowl just 10 balls. A tall left-handed opening batsman who played his strokes, Smith was the mainstay of Derbyshire's  batting line-up during the 1930s, the most successful period in the county's history. Derbyshire came second in the Championship in 1935 and won it in 1936.\nSmith played two Test matches against the South Africans in 1935 and did well enough to be considered unlucky not to play more. He played regularly for Derbyshire until 1951, acting as wicket-keeper in the immediate post-war period. He later became county coach. His career aggregate of runs and his 30 centuries for the county were both Derbyshire records until beaten by Kim Barnett in the 1990s.Smith was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1936.\nSmith died in Derby at the age of 72.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Denis Smith"]}, {"page": "Denis Smith", "response": ["Denis Smith may refer to:", "*Denis Smith (English cricketer) (1907\u20131979), played Test cricket for England", "*Denis Smith (West Indian cricketer) (born 1991), West Indian cricketer from Grenada", "*Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947), English football player and manager", "*Denis Smith (footballer, born 1932), English football player"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["From this point up to 1925, Derbyshire were perennially among the weakest counties, losing every single match in 1920 despite the efforts of Sam Cadman and Arthur Morton, persevering professionals. From 1926, the nucleus of a good team emerged around some doughty batting from Denis Smith, Stan Worthington and George Pope. Pope's bowling and that of his brother Alf, leg spinner Tommy Mitchell and seam bowler Bill Copson took the team to their one and so far only Championship victory in 1936. They won 13 of their 28 matches outright and five on first innings.

Still in the RAF in the first two-thirds of the 1947 season, Dawkes played three first-class matches for the Combined Services cricket team before his discharge in August, when he joined Derbyshire for the county's final four County Championship matches of the season. Until Dawkes' arrival, Derbyshire had lacked a full-time wicketkeeper all season: the job was being done, mostly, by the former England batsman Denis Smith, and Wisden noted that \"handicapped by injury and the cares of wicket-keeping, Denis Smith revealed only glimpses of his true form\". For some matches when Smith was injured, Derbyshire had recalled prewar wicketkeeper Harry Elliott, believed at the time to be 51, but in reality 55 years of age.

They were a strong bowling side with pacemen Bill Copson, Cliff Gladwin and George Pope all playing for England. Dusty Rhodes, bowling mainly leg break, and left-armer Eric Marsh provided support. Derbyshire, captained for the first time by Edward Gothard, played attacking cricket and were involved in several close finishes. The batting was weakened by injuries to Stan Worthington, in his final season, and Denis Smith. Charlie Elliott and Arnold Townsend topped 1,000 runs but Playfair noted that the presence of one really top-class batsman would have made an enormous difference to Derbyshire's batting. John Eggar, who topped the county averages, might have filled that gap but his teaching career enabled him to play only in August. Smith was seconded to keep wicket for most of the season until George Dawkes, formerly of Leicestershire, was able to join the team. Dawkes went on to become one of the greatest English wicketkeepers. Another notable debutant was fast bowler Les Jackson.
