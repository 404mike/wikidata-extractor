He had served in the British Army 39th Foot, which brought him to Ireland. After retiring from the army, Boycott worked as a land agent for Lord Erne, a landowner in the Lough Mask area of County Mayo.In 1880, as part of its campaign for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish National Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest the crops on Lord Erne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.\nThe campaign against Boycott became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the British press after he wrote a letter to The Times. Newspapers sent correspondents to the West of Ireland to highlight what they viewed as the victimisation of a servant of a peer of the realm by Irish nationalists. Fifty Orangemen from County Cavan and County Monaghan travelled to Lord Erne's estate to harvest the crops, while a regiment of the 19th Royal Hussars and more than 1,000 men of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) were deployed to protect the harvesters. The episode was estimated to have cost the British government and others at least \u00a310,000 to harvest about \u00a3500 worth of crops.\nBoycott left Ireland on 1 December 1880, and in 1886, became land agent for Hugh Adair's Flixton estate in Suffolk.  He died at the age of 65 on 19 June 1897 in his home in Flixton, after an illness earlier that year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Achill Island", "response": ["* Charles Boycott (1832\u20131897), unpopular landowner from whom the term boycott arose"]}, {"page": "County Mayo", "response": ["It was in this era of agrarian unrest that a new verb was introduced to the English language by Mayo - \"to boycott\".

Boycott attempted to evict eleven tenants from his land.

Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated \u2013 his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house.

In a time of agitation by tenant farmers in the Land Wars of the late 19th century, epitomised by the action of tenants at nearby Lough Mask House (home of Captain Charles Boycott), he was considered by many to be an 'improving' landlord. Some of his efforts were unsuccessful, particularly the Cong Canal, also known as 'the Dry Canal', which was built to link Lough Mask and Lough Corrib but was a failure, due to its inability to hold water. Despite such setbacks, the love borne by him and his wife Olive, daughter of The 3rd Earl of Bantry, for the castle and the estate was deep and best epitomised by the fact that, when he was ennobled in 1880, he derived his title from the island of Ardilaun, which formed part of the estate on Lough Corrib."]}, {"page": "Burgh St Peter", "response": ["==Charles Boycott==", "Charles Boycott,  grandson of Rev.
