He also made To Encourage the Others (1972), a powerful drama documentary about the Derek Bentley case, the case which was later dramatised in the 1991 film  Let Him Have It  by Peter Medak, and several documentaries, including Vodka Cola (1981) on multinational corporations. Clarke's other work in the mid-to-late 1970s included the initially unreleased documentary Bukovsky about the Soviet dissident and defector Vladimir Bukovsky and a companion Play For Today follow-up entitled Nina (1978), which starred Jack Shepherd and Eleanor Bron."]}, {"page": "Doomwatch", "response": ["| align=\"center\"| Don Shaw", "| align=\"center\"| Don Shaw", "| align=\"center\"| Don Shaw"]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| Don Shaw", "* Sovereign's Company (written by Don Shaw, directed by Alan Clarke), in the 'Alan Clarke at the BBC' box set from the BFI."]}, {"page": "Innes Lloyd", "response": ["Innes Lloyd also worked on Thirty-Minute Theatre, the football soap United! and Dead of Night, but he is best remembered as the producer of more prestigious drama. As a BBC drama producer in the 1970s and 1980s, his chosen projects were often biographical. Collaborating with authors such as Roger Milner and Don Shaw, he brought to the screen biographies from a diverse range of, often flawed, heroes ranging from Orde Wingate and Arthur \"Bomber\" Harris, the Campbells Donald and Malcolm, through to the first Director General of the BBC John Reith. He also explored notions of Englishness in the twentieth century with productions such as England, Their England (directed by Stephen Frears), East of Ipswich (written by Michael Palin) and An Englishman's Castle (1978) starring Kenneth More; a dystopian vision of the consequence of losing the second world war. He was a frequent collaborator with Alan Bennett. That relationship started in 1972 with Bennett's poignant comedy A Day Out and continued through landmark productions such as the first series of Talking Heads until Lloyd's death in 1991. Bennett's An Englishman Abroad told the remarkable true story of the chance meeting between actress Coral Browne (playing herself) and spy Guy Burgess (Alan Bates) in Moscow in 1958, while A Question of Attribution (finished shortly before Lloyd's death) was a logical sequel, showing the radically different fate of Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures and fellow traitor Anthony Blunt."]}, {"page": "Donald Shaw", "response": ["* Don Shaw (baseball) (born 1944), American baseball player", "* Don Shaw (screenwriter) (born 1934), British writer for film and television"]}, {"page": "Peak Literary Festival", "response": ["Previous festival authors included Clare Short, Tariq Ali, Matthew Parris, Gervase Phinn, Brian Turner, the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, Clive Aslet (Country Life editor), James Geary (editor of Time Magazine), Roger Protz (editor of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), Jane Fearnley Whittingstall, Colin Tudge, David Rothenberg, David and Ben Crystal, Martin Gurdon, Mark Gwynne Jones, E.
