The children are considered legitimate for all other purposes and the prohibition against bigamy applies.\"Hugh Chisholm, editor. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition. Volume 18. Morganatic Marriage. University Press, 1911, p. 835. In some countries, a woman could also marry a man of lower rank morganatically. As a result of the above, a king deciding to enter into a morganatic marriage who does not have children from a previous marriage thereby gives up the chance of being succeeded by his own children and accepts that succession would pass to his other relatives."]}, {"page": "\u00c9dith Piaf", "response": ["* Piaf, by Margaret Crosland.

H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's fleeing from Paris as the Germans advanced is based on Beauvoir's own actions - in June 1940 she travelled with friends by car to Laval and then by coach to Angers.  Blomart's reaction to the death of the baby son of his family's maid (chapter 1) is based on Beauvoir's own experience of the same as a young woman. The story of Madeleine volunteering to help in the Spanish civil War and injuring her foot by spilling hot water over it is based on a similar event that occurred to writer Simone Weil. According to another source, much of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's behaviour is based on that of Nathalie Sorokine, a pupil and friend of Beauvoir's and to whom The Blood of Others is dedicated.Deirdre Bair, Simone de Beauvoir: A Biography (Jonathan Cape, London, 1990) p. 237.", "According to biographer Deirdre Bair, the novel received a 'barrage of praise that was showered upon it.'

This is perhaps the way a novel of ideas should be presented.'
