They were rewarded by seeing their team recover from a 2\u20130 deficit to win the match 3\u20132 after extra time. The Times reported that conditions were poor because of \"bad light and slippery turf\" but the match was nevertheless \"a singularly interesting contest\". Bury arrived late and had to rush onto the field. This had an unsettling effect and Forest scored twice through Capes and John Calvey in the first two minutes. It seemed as if Forest's success was assured but Bury worked hard to prevent any more Forest goals before half-time. Forest continued to be the better team in the early part of the second half but the Bury forwards, led by Sagar, began to cause problems and Sagar himself pulled a goal back midway through the half. With less than five minutes remaining, McLuckie scored the equaliser and it was 2\u20132 at the end of normal time. The rule in this match, being a replay, was that extra time must be played but the Forest players, perhaps not knowing this, made a protest. With less than ten minutes of extra time remaining, Sagar scored his second goal to secure a 3\u20132 win and take Bury to their first FA Cup final. The Times praised Bury for \"their pluck in an uphill game\"."]}, {"page": "1902 FA Cup Final", "response": ["In the semi-final on Saturday, 15 March, Southampton returned to White Hart Lane, this time a neutral venue, to play First Division Nottingham Forest and won 3\u20131 after extra time.
