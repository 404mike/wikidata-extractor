Traditionalists within the party, centred around Winnie Ewing, by this time an MEP, responded by establishing the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, even though this would have undone the work of figures such as William Wolfe, who developed a clearly social democratic policy platform throughout the 1970s.", "|William Wolfe (1924\u20132010)", "|William Wolfe (1924\u20132010)", "* William Wolfe, 1980\u20131982", "| rowspan=\"4\" align=left| William Wolfe", "* William Wolfe, Scotland Lives: the Quest for Independence, Reprographia, 1973"]}, {"page": "Tam Dalyell", "response": ["Having been educated by left-wing economists at Cambridge, Dalyell said that he became a socialist because of the level of unemployment in Scotland. He joined the Labour Party in 1956, following the Suez Crisis. After being unsuccessful as a parliamentary candidate for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1959, he became a Member of Parliament in June 1962, when he defeated William Wolfe of the Scottish National Party in a hard-fought by-election for West Lothian. From 1983 onwards, he represented Linlithgow (when the New Town of Livingston formed its own constituency) and easily retained the seat. He became Father of the House after the 2001 general election, when Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath retired from the House of Commons. He was a nominated Member of the European Parliament from 1975\u201379, and a member of the Labour National Executive from 1986-87 representing the Campaign group."]}, {"page": "Arthur Donaldson", "response": ["This success, however, did not leave Donaldson without his critics, and at the 1967 SNP Annual Conference he faced a leadership challenge from Douglas Drysdale, which he comfortably defeated. In January 1969, Donaldson announced his intention to stand down from the SNP leadership. It was felt by a large number of party members that the SNP needed someone younger than Donaldson (then 68 years old) to lead the party. However, following a number of requests from SNP branches and members that he reconsider his decision to resign so close to a forthcoming general election, he decided to put himself forward for re-nomination as leader at the 1969 SNP Annual National Conference. At conference in June of that year, the SNP's deputy leader, William Wolfe, was elected as leader by 544 votes to 238 for Donaldson."]}, {"page": "Donald Stewart (Scottish politician)", "response": ["Stewart was the SNP's sole Westminster representative from 1970 until he was joined by Margo MacDonald who won Glasgow Govan in the by-election of 1973. At the February 1974 General Election he was joined by six other SNP MPs, and at the October General Election of that year this number increased to eleven.  Stewart became the SNP parliamentary group leader, with William Wolfe as the SNP leader overall. In 1977, Donald Stewart was appointed as a Privy Counsellor."]}, {"page": "Douglas Henderson (SNP politician)", "response": ["In September 2005, following the retirement of Winnie Ewing, he stood for the post of SNP President, losing to Ian Hudghton, Member of the European Parliament, but finishing ahead of onetime president William Wolfe.
