This was not without misgivings on the part of the Admiralty, but he was the most senior and experienced officer available. Napier hoisted his flag in February 1854 in the steam ship of the line , his subordinate commanders being the rear-admirals Armar Lowry Corry, second in command, Henry Ducie Chads, third in command, and James Hanway Plumridge, commanding the scouting forces. They were all elderly men, at most a year or so younger than Napier himself. Napier's force, which was augmented in June by a French fleet sent by Napoleon III and commanded by Alexandre Ferdinand Parseval-Deschenes, though impressive on paper, was radically unsuited to operations in the Baltic, chronically short of men and especially of experienced seamen, while he was hampered by contradictory sets of orders from the Admiralty. Nevertheless, he successfully blockaded all the Russian ports, sufficiently overawed the Russian Baltic Fleet that it never stirred from its moorings, and carried out many bombardment operations as far as the northernmost point of the Gulf of Finland. During the campaign the first ever Victoria Cross was won by midshipman Charles Davis Lucas of the gunboat , who threw a Russian explosive shell overboard before it could detonate. During the campaign Rear-Admiral Corry was invalided home because of poor health; he was replaced by Commodore (later Rear-Admiral) Henry Byam Martin. The major success of the campaign was the capture and destruction, in a near-perfect combined operation by French and British soldiers and sailors, of the Russian fortress of Bomarsund on the \u00c5land Islands, which were temporarily liberated from Russian rule and which Napier offered to Sweden (they were declined). But he refused to attack the great naval bases at Sveaborg (often quoted as the \"Gibraltar of the north\") and Kronstadt, which observation had established were probably impregnable without shallow-draught bomb vessels which he did not have; and a great outcry (led by The Times newspaper) was raised against him for his apparent lack of determination. (His inaction was thoroughly justified by the sequel: in 1855 a better-equipped Anglo-French fleet did bombard Sveaborg, but despite an enormous expenditure of ammunition caused the fortress only trifling structural damage.) Napier felt he was continually being second-guessed by the Admiralty, and especially by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir James Graham. In fact the Naval Lords were reacting to adverse press coverage and unwilling to accept the assessment of the commander on the spot, and relations between them deteriorated as his ships maintained the blockade in atrocious weather, quite unable to storm or destroy impregnable Russian fortresses into the bargain. Never one to mince his words or submit to what he felt to be unmerited criticism, Napier's 'disrespectful' tone in his despatches, which the Admiralty complained of,Russian War, 1854, Baltic and Black Sea, Official Correspondence, p. 197: Secretary of the Admiralty to Sir Charles Napier 13 January 1855:  \"... you have repeatedly thought fit to adopt a tone in your correspondence with their Lordships which is not respectful of their authority\". sealed his professional fate. Nevertheless, though lacking any dramatic action apart from the capture of Bomarsund, Napier had achieved a great deal. In one modern assessment, the campaign \"had successfully bottled up the Russian Navy for the entire first summer of the war. The tsar had been denied an opportunity to reinforce his Black Sea fleet with additional ships. The 30,000 Russian troops posted in the Gulf had also been prevented from joining the army in the Crimea.\"A Brief History of the Crimean War by Alexis S. Troubetzkoy (London: Robinson, 2006. ), p. 223. In addition, Napier's constant training had welded the fleet personnel into a much more competent force for the next year's campaign; and not a single ship had been lost."]}, {"page": "Second Melbourne ministry", "response": ["| James Hanway Plumridge"]}, {"page": "Storekeeper of the Ordnance", "response": ["*28 June 1841: James Hanway Plumridge"]}, {"page": "Penryn and Falmouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Hanway Plumridge"]}, {"page": "Hugh Elliot", "response": ["::* Harriet Agnes Elliot (died 17 April 1845), who married Admiral Sir James Hanway Plumridge MP."]}, {"page": "HMNB Devonport", "response": ["* Rear-Admiral Sir James Hanway Plumridge (appointed 19 February 1855)"]}, {"page": "HMS Sappho (1806)", "response": ["Sappho underwent repairs at Chatham in 1815.

In the Gulf of Bothnia, warfare extended to all coastal towns between 1854 and 1855, with the most significant skirmishes being seen in Rauma, Oulu, Raahe, Tornio and Kokkola. Plumbridgre had authorized Captain George Giffard of HMS Leopard to secure the closure of the Gulf of Bothnia. The British War Minister, the Duke of Newcastle, had asked to avoid destroying defenseless cities. Giffard's own initiative in the matter did not lead to action on the part of Admiral Plumridge. The devastation in Raahe caused a debate in the British House of Commons. The Quakers demanded fundraising to compensate for the damage.

She had left Haldane's father, and their son David, in 1890, after an unhappy marriage and was successfully pursuing her own writing career. Haldane set his first novel The Wooings of Jezebel Pettyfer in Jamaica and, unusually for the time, it had a West Indian hero. It was published the year he moved into Sarah's house. His next novel, The Masterfolk, was a witty portrait of bohemian life in London and Paris in the 1890s. Published in 1903, it was also the year he married Mabel Anne Plumridge (1861-1931), daughter of Admiral Sir James Hanway Plumridge and his third wife Georgina Skinner, whose brother was another army officer, Thomas Skinner. He continued to write for periodicals, combining his interest in art with critiques of exhibitions; writings which are said to have drawn the attention of Whistler. But it was his books on art, particularly his biographies of artists which became his primary source of income. Between 1903 and 1909 he wrote biographies of Henrik Ibsen, Whistler, Henry Irving, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard and \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, as well as several histories of art movements, numerous illustrations and book covers. During this period Haldane also collaborated with several artists, including Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who sculpted his bust and Claud Lovat Fraser, who with Edward Gordon Craig, provided illustrations for his essay on art and aesthetics, The Splendid Wayfaring (1913)."]}]}}
