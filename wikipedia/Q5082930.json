He described the media coverage as \"out of control ... The sheer amount of propaganda, bias, distortion, and misinformation is almost beyond comprehension.\" In the same journal, Luka Neskovic wrote that the trial \"displayed media at their worst. Sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, eccentrics, chaos, and hysteria were some of the features.\" For example, according to Neskovic, when pornography was found in Jackson's home, many media outlets misreported it as child pornography. Neskovic observed that the media was more interested in reporting the prosecution than the defense, and that, for example, The Hollywood Reporter chose not to report two weeks of the defense case."]}, {"page": "Charles Thomson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Charles Thomson (1729\u20131824) was secretary of the Continental Congress.", "* Charles Thomson (artist) (born 1953), English Stuckist artist, painter, poet, photographer", "* Charles Thomson (footballer, born 1878) (1878\u20131936), full name Charles Bellany Thomson, Scottish footballer who played for Heart of Midlothian and Sunderland", "* Charles Thomson (footballer, born 1910) (1910\u20131984), full name Charles Morgan Thomson, Scottish footballer who played for Sunderland", "* Charles Thomson (cricketer) (born 1969), Indian cricketer and coach", "* Charles Thomson (journalist) (born 1988), British journalist specializing in popular black music"]}, {"page": "Paul Foot Award", "response": [":Charles Thomson (Yellow Advertiser) - Investigation into paedophile police informant"]}, {"page": "Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary", "response": ["Neverland Firsthand makes the case that the HBO documentary Leaving Neverland, which claims that Michael Jackson sexually abused Wade Robson and James Safechuck when they were children, is flawed.
