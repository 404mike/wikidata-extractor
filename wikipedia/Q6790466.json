Sheffield Catholics bought the ageing house, which stood on the corner of Fargate and Norfolk Row. They built a small chapel in its back garden on a site which is now between the Mortuary and the Blessed Sacrament Chapels. The names of the priests who served Sheffield before the cathedral was built and the dates of their deaths are on the wall of the Mortuary Chapel. The rest of the land where the cathedral now stands became a cemetery. (Bodies from the cemetery were moved to the new Catholic cemetery at St Bede's in Rotherham and work on St Marie's began.) By 1846 the chapel was too small and the young priest, Fr. Pratt, was keen to build a church for the expanding town. A leading local architect, Matthew Ellison Hadfield, designed St Marie's, based on a 14th-century church at Heckington in Lincolnshire. The church was expensively decorated with the aid of generous donations from the Duke of Norfolk, his mother and parishioners. Fr. Pratt died while the church was being built and was buried at St Bede's. However, a stonemason, who had often heard him say he wanted to be buried in St Marie's, dug up the coffin and re\u2011buried Fr. Pratt in a tomb he had prepared near the altar. Fr Pratt's body still lies there and a plaque marks the spot, but his effigy has been moved to beneath the altar in the Mortuary chapel."]}, {"page": "1885 in architecture", "response": ["* March 9 \u2013 Matthew Ellison Hadfield, English Victorian Gothic architect (born 1812)"]}, {"page": "1812 in architecture", "response": ["* September 8 \u2013 Matthew Ellison Hadfield, English Gothic Revival architect (died 1885)"]}, {"page": "Wicker Arches", "response": ["Category:Matthew Ellison Hadfield buildings"]}, {"page": "List of Catholic artists", "response": ["*Matthew Ellison Hadfield, English architect noted for Gothic Revival churches like Salford Cathedral and St Vincent's Church in SheffieldSheffield by Ruth Harman and John Minnis"]}, {"page": "Salford Cathedral", "response": ["St. John's Church, Salford, was built between 1844 and 1848 to designs of Matthew Ellison Hadfield (1812\u20131885) of Weightman and Hadfield of Sheffield, by Benjamin Hollins of Manchester.
