A portion of the television mini-series Lorca, muerte de un poeta (1987\u20131988), directed by Juan Antonio Bardem recreates the student years of Bu\u00f1uel, Lorca and Dal\u00ed, with Fernando Valverde portraying Bu\u00f1uel in two episodes. He was played by Dimiter Guerasimof in the 1991 biopic Dal\u00ed, directed by Antoni Ribas, despite the fact that Dal\u00ed and his attorney had written to Ribas objecting to the project in its early stages in 1985. Bu\u00f1uel appeared as a character in Alejandro Pelayo's 1993 film Miroslava, based on the life of actress Miroslava Stern, who committed suicide after appearing in Ensayo de un crimen (1955). Bu\u00f1uel was played by three actors, El Gran Wyoming (old age), Pere Arquillu\u00e9 (young adult) and Juan Carlos Jim\u00e9nez Mar\u00edn (child), in Carlos Saura's 2001 fantasy, Bu\u00f1uel y la mesa del rey Salom\u00f3n, which tells of Bu\u00f1uel, Lorca and Dal\u00ed setting out in search of the mythical table of King Salom\u00f3n, which is thought to have the power to see into the past, the present and the future. Bu\u00f1uel was a character in a 2001 television miniseries Severo Ochoa: La conquista de un Nobel, on the life of the Spanish \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Nobel Prize winner in medicine, who was also at the Residencia de Estudiantes during Bu\u00f1uel's time there. Matt Lucas portrayed Bu\u00f1uel in Richard Curson Smith's 2002 TV movie Surrealissimo: The Scandalous Success of Salvador Dal\u00ed, a comedy depicting Dal\u00ed's \"trial\" by the Surrealists in 1934 for his pro-Hitler sympathies. A 2005 short called The Death of Salvador Dali, directed by Delaney Bishop, contains sequences in which Bu\u00f1uel appears, played by Alejandro Cardenas. Paul Morrison's Little Ashes hypothesizes a love affair between Dal\u00ed and Lorca, with Bu\u00f1uel (played by Matthew McNulty) looking on suspiciously. Bu\u00f1uel, played by Adrien de Van, is one of many notable personalities encountered by Woody Allen's protagonist in Midnight in Paris (2011)."]}, {"page": "John Braine", "response": ["Room at the Top was turned into a successful 1959 film, with Laurence Harvey as Joe Lampton and featuring an Oscar\u2013winning performance by Simone Signoret.
