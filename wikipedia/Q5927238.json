It was Grade II listed in 2012 for several reasons, partly because it is the first large mural relief by Dalwood, a leading British post-war sculptor, and also because of the use of materials and aesthetic quality of the work.

After a property developer bought the dock, he moved to a large minimalist studio in a former Jewish school in Stepney Green, east London, alongside the studios of Michael Kenny and Bert Irvin. The space taken by de Goede was formerly occupied by sculptor Hubert Dalwood. De Goede was an early pioneer of opening his studio to the public. He joined the London Group in 1996, when he was also a finalist for the Jerwood Prize.

There are two quadrangles, with steps leading down from the upper quadrangle (to the east) to the lower quadrangle (to the west). Residential accommodation for students and fellows is located in the lower quadrangle, whilst the hall, library, and administrative offices are in the upper quadrangle. The buildings are two storeys high, with dormers above. There are pools in the centre of the quadrangles (the one in the lower quadrangle is the longer of the two); the writer Simon Jenkins said that these are \"almost puddles\", and saw them as relics of Harrison's Mediterranean plan. The writer Peter Sager, however, thought that the pond represents the canal basin that previously occupied the site. The main entrance leads into the upper quadrangle, which has the hall on its east side. The square-mullioned windows facing the quadrangles are arranged in close-set groups of three; at the east end of the upper quadrangle, the common room has a larger bay window. An abstract sculpture by Hubert Dalwood, from 1962, has been positioned on the lawn inside the college. Dalwood also designed the fountain in the pool in the upper quadrangle, although his plan for a spray of water was not implemented, \"leaving the sculpture with no obvious purpose\"."]}, {"page": "List of public art in the London Borough of Wandsworth", "response": ["Adams?, Kenneth Armitage, Jean Arp, Mark Batten, Andr\u00e9 Bloc, Brown?, Butler, Anthony Caro, Clatworthy, Lynn Chadwick, Siegfried Charoux, Richard Bentley Claughton, Marta Colvin, Hubert Dalwood, Dow?, Alan Durst, Jacob Epstein, Elisabeth Frink, Alfred Gerrard, Dora Gordine, Barbara Hepworth, Jean-Robert Ipoust\u00e9guy, Phillip King? or Peter King?, Eric Kennington, Gilbert Ledward, F.
