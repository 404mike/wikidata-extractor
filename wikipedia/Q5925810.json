Little is known about his ancestry; according to the history of the clan Macrae his paternal grandfather was one John Macrae, also known as Ian Mac Ian Oig Dubh, \"Black John the young son of John\". Macrae's father died when he was barely five years old and the family moved to the town of Ayr where they lived in a thatched hut. Macrae's mother found a job as a washerwoman. Macrae did not have any formal education of his own but picked up bits and pieces of knowledge on the world about him. He added his own to the family's meagre earnings by delivering messages. Tired of poverty, Macrae soon ran away from home and sailed to India."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (I\u2013J)", "response": ["* J.Macrae \u2013 James Macrae (died 1830)"]}, {"page": "James Macrae, Scottish botanist", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Macrae (botanist)"]}, {"page": "J.Macrae", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Macrae (botanist)"]}]}}
