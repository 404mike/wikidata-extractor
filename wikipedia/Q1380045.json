He was quickly spotted by nearby Woolwich Arsenal of the Football League, and signed as a professional for the Gunners in June 1900.\nAshcroft immediately made his debut against Burton Swifts on 15 September 1900; although Arsenal lost 1\u20130, Ashcroft kept his place and remained an ever-present for that season, and the following one. In 1901\u201302, Ashcroft kept 17 clean sheets in 34 League matches for Woolwich Arsenal, including six clean sheets in a row (a club record, that has only been equalled once since, by Alex Manninger in 1998); Arsenal finished fourth in the Second Division that season, and third the season after that.\nAshcroft kept 20 clean sheets in 1903\u201304, a club record, as Arsenal gained promotion to the First Division, and in 1904\u201305 set a record of 154 consecutive matches for the club (since bettered only by Tom Parker). Arsenal reached the 1905\u201306 and 1906\u201307 FA Cup semi-finals twice with Ashcroft in goal, and he also won three caps for England, playing in all three of England's British Home Championship matches of 1906 (England won twice and lost once, sharing the 1905\u201306 championship with Scotland). Ashcroft thus was Arsenal's first England international.\nIn all, Ashcroft played 303 first-class games in eight seasons for Arsenal. He was sold to Blackburn Rovers in the summer of 1908 to alleviate the club's financial problems. He played over 120 times for Rovers, and reached another FA Cup semi-final in 1910\u201311, and won the First Division title in 1911\u201312. In 1913 he was released by Blackburn on a free transfer; unable to find a club, he had to place an advertisement in The Athletic News, which read:\n\nJ Ashcroft, goalkeeper, Blackburn Rovers, open for engagement; free transfer \u2013 Willaston Road, Walton, Liverpool.Ashcroft eventually signed for Tranmere Rovers, where he played for one more season before World War I intervened and all first-class football was halted; he seems to have retired from playing football at that point.

Phil Kelso replaced Bradshaw in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905\u201306 and 1906\u201307 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid uncertainty over the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought about much larger attendances."]}, {"page": "Jim Ashcroft", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Ashcroft "]}]}}
