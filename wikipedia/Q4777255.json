Despite being four points from the play-offs, Raj Singh took the surprising decision to sack Craig Hignett after a defeat at Stockport County. Club legend Antony Sweeney acted as caretaker manager for five matches before the appointment of Dave Challinor. Pools' league form continued to gradually improve under Challinor, and by early March, Hartlepool were within touching distance of the top 7. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the season after 39 games with Hartlepool in 9th place, three points from the play-offs. Following a decision to finish the league via a points-per-game basis, Hartlepool finished in 12th, the club's first top-half finish since the 2006\u201307 season.", "|align=\"left\"|Antony Sweeney", "* 2011  Antony Sweeney", "| Antony Sweeney"]}, {"page": "Neale Cooper", "response": ["Pools secured a play-off spot thanks to a 1-1 draw at Swindon Town on the final day.

While playing for the youth team, Robson gained the reputation of being a quick and pacey winger with a keen eye for set pieces. He won Hartlepool's Young Player of the Year Award for 2002\u201303. For the 2003\u201304 season, manager Neale Cooper promoted him to the first team in order to fill the team's \"problem position\" of left back.", "During his time with Carlisle, Robson ended up scoring against his former club Hartlepool three times.

Then in a second match against Colchester United of the season on 5 February 2011, he played a vital role in a 1\u20130 win when he set up a goal for Antony Sweeney to score the only goal in the game. Ten days later on 15 February 2011, he set up two goals in a 2\u20131 win over Charlton Athletic.
