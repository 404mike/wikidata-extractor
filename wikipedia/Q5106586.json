They combine Afro-Brazilian influences with other strands from the melting pot of their native London. Franck and Forge previously worked together with the Brighton-based group Batu before setting up Da Lata as a more studio based project.  Franck is the main creative force as songwriter, producer and multi-instrumentalist, whereas Forge, better known as a DJ and broadcaster, is credited as co-producer. They made three albums for Palm Pictures: Songs from the Tin (2000), Serious (2003) and a collection of their remix work for other artists, Remixes, which featured their interpretations of songs by Femi Kuti, Luciano, Bebel Gilberto and Sly and Robbie, among others.

It was scheduled for release in early 2013.", "Da Lata's first release was as Trio Da Lata for Brownswood Records in Japan. The song \"Deep Water\" featured former Batu vocalist Sharon Scott. However, it was their next release, a version of Edu Lobo's classic \"Ponteio\" that garnered attention, crossing over between house and jazz-dance audiences. \"Ponteio\" was supported particularly strongly in Japan and in New York by the Body&Soul DJs. Despite the success of this single, Da Lata was put on hold for a few years whilst Chris Franck wrote, produced and toured with Smoke City. In 1998, they recorded a song that had been initially demoed four years earlier; it was on the strength of the song \"Pra Manha\" that they were signed to Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures."]}, {"page": "Mr. Gorgeous (and Miss Curvaceous)", "response": ["** Chris Franck \u2013 writing"]}, {"page": "Underwater Love (Smoke City song)", "response": ["The Brazilian-inspired track is built upon a gentle, constant guitar strum, drums and samples, some of which are rainforest noises, others are from \"Bahia Soul\" by Luiz Bonf\u00e1 and \"Mother Popcorn\" by James Brown.
