He composed both instrumental and vocal works for soloists, chamber groups and full choruses and orchestras. He was greatly esteemed by fellow musicians and was at the peak of his fame in the mid-20th century. The most famous of his pieces are his eleven symphonies.  Although he was active at a time when many people wrote twelve-tone music, he decided not to write in this idiom himself. Instead he devised his own distinctive style. His later works were not as popular with the concert-going public as his previous ones had been, although he never lost the respect of his colleagues. Therefore, his output as a whole is less celebrated today than would have been expected from its early popularity. He was the brother of the engineer Arthur Rubbra.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)", "response": ["The scale and influence of Beethoven's ninth led later composers to ascribe a special significance to their own ninth symphonies, which may have contributed to the cultural phenomenon known as the curse of the ninth. A number of other composers' ninth symphonies also employ a chorus, such as those by Kurt Atterberg, Mieczys\u0142aw Weinberg, Edmund Rubbra, Hans Werner Henze, and Robert Kyr. Anton Bruckner had not originally intended his unfinished ninth symphony to feature choral forces, however the use of his choral Te Deum in lieu of the uncompleted Finale was supposedly sanctioned by the composer. Dmitri Shostakovich had originally intended his Ninth Symphony to be a large work with chorus and soloists, although the symphony as it eventually appeared was a relatively short work without vocal forces.Fay, Laurel E.

In addition, Foss worked to secure OUP's rights not only to music publication and live performance, but the \"mechanical\" rights to recording and broadcast. It was not at all clear at the time how significant these would become. Indeed, Foss, OUP, and a number of composers at first declined to join or support the Performing Right Society, fearing that its fees would discourage performance in the new media.

A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was an important influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.", "According to the composer Edmund Rubbra, who studied under him in the early 1920s, Holst was \"a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of Prout and Stainer, but with a miniature score of Petrushka or the then recently published Mass in G minor of Vaughan Williams\".Rubbra, p. 40 He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. \"I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest\u2014if I agreed!\u2014that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon\u00a0... He frequently took away [because of] his abhorrence of unessentials.\"Rubbra, p. 41", "Warrack emphasises that Holst acquired an instinctive understanding\u2014perhaps more so than any English composer\u2014of the importance of folksong. In it he found \"a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language\". Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as \"the greatest influence on my music\",Short, pp. 336\u201338 although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally. Among later composers, Michael Tippett is acknowledged by Short as Holst's \"most significant artistic successor\", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there. Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: \"Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision\".Tippett, p. 15 Kennedy observes that \"a new generation of listeners\u00a0... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett\". Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: \"With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone\"."]}, {"page": "Northampton", "response": ["The composers Malcolm Arnold, William Alwyn, Trevor Hold, Edmund Rubbra and Robert Walker were born in Northampton.

The Violin Concerto (Op. 32, 1948) has been cited as \"a work as beautiful and refined as any in the genre since Walton's\". Foreman considers the concerto, which uses twelve-tone themes, to be the epitome of Bush's thematic theory of composition, although Bush's contemporary, Edmund Rubbra, thought it too intellectual for general audiences.Foreman, pp. 118\u201319 The Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue for timpani, percussion and strings, (Op. 52, 1959), involves eight variations in the Dorian mode, followed by eight in other modes culminating in a final quadruple fugue in six parts.Foreman, p. 141 Musical Opinions critic praised the composer's \"wonderful control and splendid craftsmanship\" in this piece, and predicted that it could become the most popular of all Bush's orchestral works.

Haydn in particular was fond of using the opening theme, often in a truncated or otherwise altered form, to announce the move to the dominant, as in the first movement of his Sonata Hob. XVI No. 49 in E major. Mozart also occasionally wrote such expositions: for instance in the Piano Sonata K. 570 or the String Quintet K. 593. Such expositions are often called monothematic, meaning that one theme serves to establish the opposition between tonic and dominant keys. This term is misleading, since most \"monothematic\" works have multiple themes: most works so labeled have additional themes in the second subject group. Rarely, as in the fourth movement of Haydn's String Quartet in B major, Op. 50, No. 1, did composers perform the tour de force of writing a complete sonata exposition with just one theme.
