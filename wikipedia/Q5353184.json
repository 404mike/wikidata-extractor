Turned down by all the major funding bodies, key festivals and institutional production partners in the UK, the film was eventually funded through a mix of private investors and Constantine's substantial personal investment. The film was eventually picked up for distribution by Universal Pictures who sub-licensed the theatrical release to Munro Film Services. Despite only being given a three-day theatrical window and a limited marketing campaign, the film went on to become the widest short-window release to date in the UK according to its producers. Initially expected to open on six to fourteen screens nationally, the film opened on 89 screens on its opening night and 120 screens across its opening weekend. With 97/98 % seat occupancy across 235 individual screenings these were enough to propel the film into the box office top 10 for its opening weekend."]}, {"page": "London Film Critics Circle Awards 2014", "response": ["*Elaine Constantine \u2013 Northern Soul"]}, {"page": "68th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Northern Soul \u2013 Elaine Constantine (Director/Producer)"]}, {"page": "2015 Toronto International Film Festival", "response": ["*Northern Soul by Elaine Constantine"]}, {"page": "Tish Murtha", "response": ["*Distinctly, Pingyao International Photography Festival, Pingyao, China, September 2018.
