She played for England 11 times between 1946 and 1950 and won various trophies including the Championship of the Netherlands.She was doubles finalist winning a silver medal at the 1949 World Table Tennis Championships with Joan Crosby, they lost in the final to the then World Champion, Hungary's Gizi Farkas and Scot Helen Elliot. Barnes won another silver medal as part of the women's team consisting of Joan Crosby, Margaret Franks and Adele Wood.She was considered particularly glamorous among sports personalities of the late 1940s.In 1952, she married the actor Sam Kydd; their son is the actor Jonathan Kydd.  Following her marriage, Pinkie became an advertising copywriter, working for Masius & Ferguson, and was one of the first women in the UK to hold such a position.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of copywriters", "response": ["* Pinkie Barnes, a table tennis champion who later became a copywriter."]}, {"page": "Sam Kydd", "response": ["He married Pinkie Barnes, an ex-international table tennis champion (she was World Doubles Finalist in 1948) and one of Britain's first women advertising copywriters.
