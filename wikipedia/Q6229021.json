He played as a midfielder.\nDeary began his career with Alan Ball's young Blackpool team in 1980. Unlike the rest, however, he went on to appear in over 300 games for the club. He started as an apprentice, signing for the Seasiders in March 1980. He made his debut on 5 September 1980, in a 2\u20131 victory at Fulham. The management seemed uncertain whether to play Deary in the heart of defence or deep in midfield, but he eventually established himself in the latter position.\nDeary scored his first league goal on 29 September 1982, in a 2\u20131 victory at Chester City. The following season, 1983\u201384, he scored a hat-trick in a 3\u20131 victory over Hereford United at Bloomfield Road on 28 April 1984.\nA tough tackler who enjoyed pushing forwards, Deary was Blackpool's top scorer during their 1984\u201385 promotion season, with fifteen goals in all competitions.\nAt the end of the 1988\u201389 season, Deary decided to move on, his place now coming under pressure. Blackpool's neighbours, Burnley, snapped him up for \u00a330,000.\nAfter six years at Turf Moor, Deary spent two years with Rochdale, before finishing his career with a short spell at Southport. He scored a goal in each of his first four games for Southport, but was sent off in his fifth and final game for the club, before injury forced him to retire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deary", "response": ["* John Deary, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Mike Davies (footballer)", "response": ["Initially a right winger, he won a regular place in the team, replacing Ian Britton and forming a partnership with John Deary.
