When the Chinese Emperor chose to embargo European manufactured commodities and demand payment for all Chinese goods in silver, the price rose, restricting trade. The East India Company began to produce something desired by the Chinese as much as tea was by the British: opium. This had a significant influence on both India and China. Opium was also imported into Britain and was not prohibited because it was thought to be medically beneficial. Laudanum, made from opium, was used as a pain killer, to induce sleep and to suppress anxiety. The famous literary opium addicts Thomas De Quincey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Wilkie Collins also took it for its pleasurable effects. The Limehouse area in London was notorious for its opium dens, many of which catered for Chinese sailors as well as English addicts."]}, {"page": "December 8", "response": ["*1859 \u2013 Thomas De Quincey, English journalist and author (b. 1785)"]}, {"page": "Freemasonry", "response": ["Alternatively, Thomas De Quincey in his work titled Rosicrucians and Freemasonry put forward the theory that suggested that Freemasonry may have been an outgrowth of Rosicrucianism.

In the book, it is not Ottoman, nor Chinese, addicts about whom he writes, but English opium users: \"I question whether any Turk, of all that ever entered the paradise of opium-eaters, can have had half the pleasure I had.\" De Quincey writes about the great English Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772\u20131834), whose \"Kubla Khan\" is also widely considered to be a poem of the opium experience. Coleridge began using opium in 1791 after developing jaundice and rheumatic fever, and became a full addict after a severe attack of the disease in 1801, requiring 80\u2013100 drops of laudanum daily."]}, {"page": "Samuel Taylor Coleridge", "response": ["In 1804, he travelled to Sicily and Malta, working for a time as Acting Public Secretary of Malta under the Civil Commissioner, Alexander Ball, a task he performed successfully. He lived in San Anton Palace in the village of Attard.  He gave this up and returned to England in 1806. Dorothy Wordsworth was shocked at his condition upon his return. From 1807 to 1808, Coleridge returned to Malta and then travelled in Sicily and Italy, in the hope that leaving Britain's damp climate would improve his health and thus enable him to reduce his consumption of opium. Thomas De Quincey alleges in his Recollections of the Lakes and the Lake Poets that it was during this period that Coleridge became a full-blown opium addict, using the drug as a substitute for the lost vigour and creativity of his youth.  It has been suggested that this reflects De Quincey's own experiences more than Coleridge's."]}, {"page": "1818", "response": ["** The Westmorland Gazette is first published at Kendal in the Lake District of England; in July, Thomas De Quincey will begin a 16-month term as editor."]}, {"page": "Soho", "response": ["Greek Street was first laid out around 1680 and was named after a nearby Greek church.
