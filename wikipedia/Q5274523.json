Newspapers reported on employee dissatisfaction with Hutchison's tenure at EastEnders. In January 2005, Hutchison left the soap and John Yorke (who by this time, was the BBC Controller of Continuing Drama Series) took total control of the show himself and became acting Executive Producer for a short period, before appointing Kate Harwood to the role. Harwood stayed at EastEnders for 20 months before being promoted by the BBC.

Despite this, the programme has been criticised by the Commission for Racial Equality, who argued in 2002 that EastEnders was not giving a realistic representation of the East End's \"ethnic make-up\". They suggested that the average proportion of visible minority faces on EastEnders was substantially lower than the actual ethnic minority population in East London boroughs, and it therefore reflected the East End in the 1960s, not the East End of the 2000s. The programme has since attempted to address these issues.

The storyline was developed as of the BBC's Headroom campaign, which aims to encourage people to look after their mental wellbeing. Series Consultant Simon Ashdown had been developing the storyline for about a year. To accurately reflect the issue, EastEnders worked closely with various charities such as Mind and MDF The BiPolar Organisation, medical practitioners and bipolar sufferers when researching the storyline. The story was moulded around what Stacey would do in that situation and what the research led the team to believe was the most truthful way events would develop. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that the initial buildup of the storyline was an extension of how the character has always been, \"a character of highs and lows, of great passions and dark moods,\" but these highs and lows would become more contrasted, and viewers would realise that Stacey's mood is more complex than just being upset over her losses, adding, \"It's the beginning of us getting to really know and understand who Stacey is and what makes her behave the way she does.\" Turner hoped that she could do the storyline justice, saying that she believed it was great that EastEnders continued to raise awareness of the issue."]}, {"page": "Keith Miller (EastEnders)", "response": ["Keith Miller is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by David Spinx.

For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as \"a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it.\" He added, \"I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in EastEnders.' It's brilliant.\" Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said \"[Steven] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people to be thinking about him [all the time]...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world.\"", "The storyline eventually reached its climax in October 2007. Steven's games were uncovered, and during the confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife Jane (Laurie Brett) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline has been described by The Guardian journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having \"a whiff of Bront\u00eb about it\", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, \"It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like Dickens. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love \u2013 Ian Beale \u2013 as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show.

However, he reprised the role in 2002 before being axed by producer Louise Berridge in 2004. In 2008, producer Diederick Santer introduced the character for a third time, along with his wife Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Ricky is portrayed as unintelligent, simplistic, easily led and bossed around by dominant personalities. On 26 February 2011, it was announced that Owen would take a temporary break from the show.  The character exited on 19 July 2011, returning five months later on 13 December 2011. Ricky left EastEnders on 17 January 2012.

Owen commented: \"It will be interesting to see what has been happening to Ricky and Bianca over the last few years. Although I must admit I'm not looking forward to her nagging me by shouting his name.\" Executive producer Diederick Santer commented: \"First Patsy comes home, now Sid! Ricky and Bianca were a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show [...] Seeing Bianca back on the show is exciting in itself, but to throw Ricky into the equation gives things an added dimension. Ricky's a great and much-loved character in his own right, but what's really exciting to me is the two of them together. There's so much history, drama and passion to explore [...] There'll always be a connection between Ricky and Bianca\". To promote the characters' return, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008. One trailer utilised Bianca's \"trademark holler\" of Ricky's name, which is so loud that it smashes the windows of The Queen Victoria public house. The trailer featured the Righteous Brothers' song \"Hung on You\".", "In 2008, when it was announced that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as \"a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show\". Other media sources branded them two of \"the most popular characters on the soap\" and an \"iconic couple\". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, \"It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?\". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back \"is very welcome\". He comments, \"Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see over the next couple of years?). Like it!

I'm really looking forward to the next chapter in her story.\"", "Bianca's most notable initial storyline upon her return was a pedophilia plot revolving around her new boyfriend Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15-year-old step daughter, Whitney. The idea for the storyline was conceptualized by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by an image of a woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering \"What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a pedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family\". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that \"It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\" However, pedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, \"We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\" It has been noted in the media that pedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult.", "The character of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producers Diederick Santer and Jon Sen have described Bianca as \"one of the most popular characters EastEnders has ever had\", and an \"iconic creation\", respectively. James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is \"adored\". Palmer has suggested that viewers \"rooted\" for Bianca because \"people love a stroppy girl\". In 2000, she commented, \"[Bianca] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think.\" Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, \"It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [to EastEnders] for everyone else's sake.\" When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said \"Good riddance!\" She described Bianca as a \"king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain\" and a \"prize slapper [who] tormented all those whose paths [she] crossed.\""]}, {"page": "Carol Jackson", "response": ["Having originally appeared between 1993 and 1997 and again in 1999 and despite Coulson ruling out a return to the programme in 2008, it was announced on 25 October 2009 that Carol would return to the show in 2010 along with her children Robbie, Sonia and Billie.
