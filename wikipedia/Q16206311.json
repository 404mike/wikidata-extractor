Three minutes later, Newport made their third substitution with Matt being replaced by Azeez.  A minute later, Davies made a comfortable save from a Willmott header and a subsequent chance from Amond.

Before the start of the second half of extra time, Newport made their fourth and final substitution, Keanu Marsh-Brown coming on for Willmott.  Within a minute of his introduction, Marsh-Brown's shot was saved by Davies.  Norwood then went close, denied once again by Davies, before Banks' free kick was struck high over the Newport crossbar.  Two minutes later, Poole's foul on Jennings earned him a yellow card.  In the 115th minute, Tranmere made their third substitution, with Adam Buxton coming on to replace Nelson.  With three minutes of regular extra time remaining, Norwood's header from a Banks cross was saved by Day. In the 119th minute, the deadlock was broken as Tranmere took the lead through Jennings.  Buxton beat Bakinson to create space and sent Caprice down the right wing.  His cross to the back post went beyond Norwood but the unmarked Jennings headed the ball past Day to make it 1\u20130 to Tranmere.  Two minutes of injury time were played during which Newport had a free kick which came to nothing, and the match ended with Tranmere victorious, winning back-to-back promotions.", "|DF ||2 ||Adam Buxton ||||"]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2019 || RB ||  || Adam Buxton ||  Morecambe || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2020 || RB ||  || Adam Buxton ||  Prestatyn Town || Released || "]}]}}
