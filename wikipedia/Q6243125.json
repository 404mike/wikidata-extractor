This allowed Allchurch and a number of other youth players, including Terry Medwin and John King to establish themselves in the squad, Allchurch becoming the youngest player in the club's history to be ever present during an entire season, having played in every league game for the club, during the 1950\u201351 season. Further approaches from Liverpool, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester City were also rejected by the Swans. However, the side struggled to perform in the Second Division, finishing in 18th and 19th positions between 1950 and 1952, and Allchurch contemplated a move away from Vetch Field after being encouraged by some teammates at international level to move to a First Division side."]}, {"page": "John King (Welsh footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John King (footballer, born 1933)"]}, {"page": "John King (footballer born 1933)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John King (footballer, born 1933)"]}]}}
