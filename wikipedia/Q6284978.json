Lister was a native of Stockport, and served in the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers. He earned his medal for storming two machine gun posts and capturing 100 enemy troops.\nOn 9 October 1917 east of Ypres, Belgium, seeing that the advance of his company was held up by machine-gun fire from the direction of a pillbox, Sergeant Lister dashed ahead of his men and found the gun - he shot two of the gunners and the remainder surrendered. He then went to the pillbox and shouted to the occupants to surrender. They did so with the exception of one man whom the sergeant shot, whereupon about 100 of the enemy emerged from the shell-holes further to the rear and surrendered.Sergeant Lister survived the war and died in 1963. He is buried in Willow Grove Cemetery, Reddish. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.\n100 years after his actions, Salford City Council unveiled a commemorative paving stone, outside Broughton Hub, in his honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Lister (disambiguation)", "response": ["Joseph Lister (1827\u20131912) was a British surgeon and pioneer of antiseptic surgery.", "Joseph Lister may also refer to:", "*Joseph Lister (VC) (1886\u20131963), sergeant in the British Army and recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*Joseph Lister (cricketer) (1930\u20131991), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Lancashire Fusiliers", "response": ["* Sergeant Joseph Lister, Great War"]}, {"page": "Lister (surname)", "response": ["* Joseph Lister, British surgeon and pioneer of antiseptic surgery", "* Joseph Jackson Lister (1786\u20131869), British amateur opticist and physicist; father of Joseph Lister", "* Joseph Lister (VC), received VC for actions at the Third Battle of Ypres"]}]}}
