He was a merchant seaman who became a sea captain, making voyages both as a slave trader and as a privateer against French shipping. He was Mayor of Liverpool in 1819\u20131820. In later life he was involved in canal and railway development.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal", "response": ["In March 1829 the idea of building a branch railway line from the Oldfield Road terminus in Salford to the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway was mooted, but nothing was built. In 1830 the canal company, led by chairman Sir John Tobin, began to promote a proposal to build a railway along the line of the canal, from Salford to Bolton. Alexander Nimmo was employed to report on the proposal and told that it was possible \"so far as he expressed himself capable of judging from his present cursory view of the canal\". The shareholders then sought a bill for a railway from Bolton to Manchester and on 23 August 1831 obtained an Act of Parliament to become the \"Company of Proprietors of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company\". They were empowered to build a line from Manchester to Bolton and Bury, \"upon or near the line of\u00a0...\u00a0the Canal\", and a branch from Clifton Aqueduct through to Great Lever. In 1832 this company obtained an Act that allowed it to build the railway. Due mainly to the objections of local mine owners who would have lost access to the canal and supplies, and would not have had branch railways built for them, the company agreed to an amending bill which would keep the canal and allow the new railway to be constructed alongside it. Due to technical and financial constraints the branch to Bury was never built. The canal therefore survived, although locks 4 and 5 in Salford were moved and combined into a two-rise staircase, with a second tunnel built underneath the line which became known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway."]}, {"page": "Liscard", "response": ["Liscard Hall was built in 1835 by a Liverpool merchant, Sir John Tobin.
