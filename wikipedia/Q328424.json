He was the third of five sons born to J. Paul Getty (1892\u20131976), one of the richest men in the world at the time. His mother was J. Paul Getty's fourth wife, Ann Rork. The Getty family's wealth was the result of the oil business founded by George Franklin Getty. One of his sons, Mark Getty, co-founded the visual media company Getty Images.\nAt birth, he was given the name Eugene Paul Getty, but in later life, he adopted other names, including Paul Getty, John Paul Getty, Jean Paul Getty Jr. and John Paul Getty II. In 1973, his son John Paul Getty III was held captive in Italy, as J. Paul Getty refused to pay a ransom. In 1986, he was awarded an honorary knighthood for services to causes ranging from cricket, to art and to the Conservative Party. His honorary knighthood would eventually become substantive upon the required acquisition of British citizenship. A long-time Anglophile, he became a British citizen in 1997. In 1998 he changed his name by deed poll when he renounced the first name Eugene and wished to be known as Sir Paul Getty, KBE.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 7", "response": ["*  1932   \u2013 John Paul Getty Jr., American-English philanthropist and book collector (d. 2003)"]}, {"page": "1932", "response": ["** John Paul Getty Jr., American-born philanthropist (d. 2003)"]}, {"page": "Augustus John", "response": ["By Ian Fleming's widowed mother, Evelyn Ste Croix Fleming,  Rose, he had a daughter, Amaryllis Fleming (1925\u20131999), who became a noted cellist.

She described an incident while the two were abroad in Italy in which she claimed Getty forced her to climb to view the crater of Mount Vesuvius while she was pregnant with their first son.
