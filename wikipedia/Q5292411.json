He is best known for his recordings of \"Walk With Me My Angel\" and \"Bring Your Love to Me\".  He also produced several of The Tornados' tracks including \"Space Walk\" and \"Goodbye Joe\".  The latter title referred his original mentor and producer, Joe Meek. Meek regarded Charles highly. \"You are my only legit artist\", Meek once informed Charles. \"All the others are yugga-dugs\". Standing at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m), and weighing around seventeen stone (108 kilograms, 238 pounds), Charles stood out in more ways than one from his fellow performers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Bellamy (musician)", "response": ["Bellamy left the Tornados in 1963 when it became necessary to cease touring because of problems with his lower spine.

But barking dogs often spoiled the recordings.  Weismann found a new use for these spoiled takes by splicing together the pitches of dog barks into the pattern of songs.  He teamed up with Don Charles, a record producer working in Copenhagen, Denmark (not the same person as an English record producer also named Don Charles).Joel Whitburn, Top Pop Singles 1955-2008. Record Research, Milwaukee, WI, 2009. Weismann used recordings of five dogs barking (their names were Dolly, Pearl, Pussy, Caesar, and King), spliced them on reel-to-reel tape, and arranged the pitches to the tune of the Stephen Foster song \"Oh! Susanna\". Charles provided the musical accompaniment. This was released by RCA Victor in 1955 as the A-side on a 7\" single, with the B-side a medley of \"Pat-a-Cake\", \"Three Blind Mice\", and \"Jingle Bells\". The novelty record became a hit, reaching #22 on the US Billboard Pop Singles chart. The disc eventually sold over a million copies.\"The Caroling Dogs of Copenhagen\". Life, December 19, 1955. In 1956, the troupe of dogs (with a fifth member, Pussy) were again recorded, yielding the single \"Hot Dog Rock 'n Roll\" b/w \"Hot Dog Boogie\". This recording is listed as being \"directed\" by Carl Weismann."]}, {"page": "That's The Way It Goes", "response": ["*Guess That's The Way It Goes, song\tDon Charles, Meek\t1962"]}, {"page": "1933 in British music", "response": ["*10 December \u2013 Don Charles, singer and record producer (died 2005)"]}, {"page": "Daniel Boone discography", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |\"And I'm Crying Again\" (with Don Charles; credited as Don & Pete)b/w \"Time Will Tell\""]}]}}
