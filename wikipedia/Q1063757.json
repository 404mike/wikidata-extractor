Mary Howitt published the story as \"Tommelise\" in Wonderful Stories for Children in 1846. However, she did not approve of the opening scene with the witch, and, instead, had the childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman who then rewarded her hostess with a barleycorn. Charles Boner also translated the tale in 1846 as \"Little Ellie\" while Madame de Chatelain dubbed the child 'Little Totty' in her 1852 translation. The editor of The Child's Own Book (1853) called the child throughout, 'Little Maja'."]}, {"page": "The Princess and the Pea", "response": ["Charles Boner was the first to translate \"The Princess and the Pea\" into English, working from a German translation that had increased Andersen's lone pea to a trio of peas in an attempt to make the story more credible, an embellishment also added by another early English translator, Caroline Peachey.  Boner's translation was published as \"The Princess on the Peas\" in A Danish Story-Book in 1846.  Boner has been accused of missing the satire of the tale by ending with the rhetorical question, \"Now was not that a lady of exquisite feeling?\" rather than Andersen's joke of the pea being placed in the Royal Museum. Boner and Peachey's work established the standard for English translations of the fairy tales, which, for almost a century, as Wullschlager notes, \"continued to range from the inadequate to the abysmal\".", "Tales of extreme sensitivity are infrequent in world culture but a few have been recorded. As early as the 1st century, Seneca the Younger had mentioned a legend about a Sybaris native who slept on a bed of roses and suffered due to one petal folding over.A Bed of Roses Also similar is the medieval Perso-Arabic legend of al-Nadirah. The 11th-century Kathasaritsagara by Somadeva tells of a young man who claims to be especially fastidious about beds. After sleeping in a bed on top of seven mattresses and newly made with clean sheets, the young man rises in great pain. A crooked red mark is discovered on his body and upon investigation a hair is found on the bottom-most mattress of the bed. An Italian tale called \"The Most Sensitive Woman\" tells of a woman whose foot is bandaged after a jasmine petal falls upon it. The Brothers Grimm included a \"Princess on the Pea\" tale in an edition of their Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen but removed it after they discovered that it belonged to the Danish literary tradition. A few folk tales feature a boy discovering a pea or a bean assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night he tosses and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw and is therefore of aristocratic blood. In the more popular versions of the tale, only one pea is used. However, Charles Boner added in two more peas in his translation of the story upon which Andersen based his tale. Other differences amongst versions can be seen in various numbers of mattresses as well as feather beds. Versions of the story differ based on whether or not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all and the princess decides to lie all on her own."]}, {"page": "The Swineherd", "response": ["The tale was first published by C. A.

He missed the earthy, joking style of \"The Tinderbox\" in preference for the embellished, stilted literary diction of the period, and translated the king's, \"We will not ... \", for example, to \"We are not graciously pleased.\"Wullschlager 298-9 Boner's translation was published as \"The Tinder Box\" in A Danish Story-Book in 1846."]}, {"page": "Count Dracula", "response": ["Similarly, the novelist did not want to disclose the precise site of the Count's residence, Castle Dracula. As confirmed by Stoker's own handwritten research notes, the novelist had a specific location for the Castle in mind while writing the narrative: an empty mountain top in the Transylvanian Kelemen alps near the former border with Moldavia. Efforts to promote the Poenari Castle (ca. 200\u00a0km away from the novel's place of action near the Borgo Pass) as the \"real Castle Dracula\" have no basis in Stoker's writing; although it bears much similarity to the fictional Castle Dracula, no written evidence shows Stoker to have heard of it. Regarding the Bran Castle near Bra\u0219ov, Stoker possibly saw an illustration of Castle Bran (T\u00f6rzburg) in Charles Boner's 1865 book on Transylvania, Transylvania: Its Products and Its People. Although Stoker may have been inspired by its romantic appearance, neither Boner, nor Mazuchelli nor Crosse (who also mention Terzburg or T\u00f6rzburg) associate it with Vlad III; for the site of his fictitious Castle Dracula, Stoker preferred an empty mountain top."]}, {"page": "Castle Dracula", "response": ["A further option is that Stoker saw an illustration of Castle Bran (T\u00f6rzburg) in the book on Transylvania by Charles Boner, or read about it in the books by Mazuchelli or Crosse.Charles Boner, Transylvania: Its Products and Its People.

In 1893 Bram Stoker discovered Cruden Bay in Scotland, which became the regular spot for his monthly summer holiday, largely devoted to writing. Parts, if not most, of Dracula, were written there. Nearby Slains Castle appears to have inspired part of the floor plan for Castle Dracula, in particular the octagonal room:  \u2018The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort.\u2019 Compare this with the description of Slains Castle from a 1922 sales document: \u2018On the Principle Floor: Entrance Hall (heated with stove) leading to Central Octagonal Interior Hall (heated with stove and lighted from above).\u2019"]}, {"page": "Boner (surname)", "response": ["* Charles Boner (1815\u20131870), English travel writer, poet and translator"]}, {"page": "Boner, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Boner"]}]}}
