In November 1815, the Prince Regent's librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince's London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming Emma to the Prince. Though Austen disliked the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request.Austen letter to James Stannier Clarke, 15 November 1815; Clarke letter to Austen, 16 November 1815; Austen letter to John Murray, 23 November 1815, in Le Faye (1995), 296\u2013298. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour.Halperin (1985), 734 She later wrote Plan of a Novel, according to Hints from Various Quarters, a satiric outline of the \"perfect novel\" based on the librarian's many suggestions for a future Austen novel.Litz (1965), 164\u2013165; Honan (1987), 367\u2013369, describes the episode in detail. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke's often pompous literary advice, and the Plan of A Novel parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all of the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian."]}, {"page": "John Lockhart-Ross", "response": ["Lockhart was born on 11 November 1721 at Lockhart Hall, Lanarkshire, the fifth son of Sir James Lockhart, 2nd Baronet.James Stanier Clarke and Stephen Jones, \"The Naval Chronicle\" (Page 44); Published by J.

Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously.Fergus, 13\u201314. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy.Le Faye, Family Record, 225. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince\".Qtd. in Le Faye, Family Record, 226; also see Jane Austen to J. S. Clarke, 11 December 1815, courtesy of janeausten.co.uk, 17 July 2011. Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, Emma was dedicated to him.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, then at Naples, produced an obituary essay on the death of Alexander Ball, one of Nelson's captains whom he had known, and commented on Nelson's qualities. An official biography was written by John McArthur and James Stanier Clarke and published in 1809. This was followed by a work by Robert Southey in 1813, and Lord Byron wrote in his 1819 poem Don Juan that 'Nelson was Britannia's god of war'. In the 1840s Nicholas Harris Nicolas drew up and published Nelson's collected correspondence. Thomas Carlyle's earliest works included a brief biographical sketch of Nelson, and he returned to consider Nelson in his 1839 work Heroes and Hero Worship. Thomas Pettigrew, capitalising on a resurgence of interest in Nelson, produced a new biography in the 1840s. Herman Melville references Nelson many times throughout his works, including Omoo (Chs. 15,29), Mardi (Chs. 24,30), Redburn (Chs. 29, 31, 32, 36, 41), White-Jacket (Chs. 6, 16, 27, 36, 38, 50, 52, 68, 74, 75), Moby-Dick (Chs. 8,35), and Billy Budd (Ch. 4).
