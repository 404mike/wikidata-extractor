The next, a volley, was held onto by Norman while the third, a header from a Shearer pass, was deflected over the Sunderland crossbar.  On 18 minutes, White then ran onto a weak backpass from McPhail and pushed the ball past Norman.  His shot rolled along the goal line and struck the post, and the deflection was then struck by Shearer but Norman kept the ball out.  Tom Jones then took a shot which Norman blocked with his legs.
