He worked with the Ceylon Civil Service from 1910 to 1932, and from 1932 to 1955 he was employed by Princeton University in the Department of Philosophy. He is most renowned for his work in the philosophy of mysticism, and for books like Mysticism and Philosophy (1960) and Teachings of the Mystics (1960). These works have been influential in the study of mysticism, but they have also been severely criticised for their lack of methodological rigor and their perennialist pre-assumptions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 2", "response": ["*1967 \u2013 Walter Terence Stace, English-American epistemologist, philosopher, and academic (b. 1886)"]}, {"page": "Golden Rule", "response": ["Walter Terence Stace, in The Concept of Morals (1937), wrote:"]}, {"page": "November 17", "response": ["*1886 \u2013 Walter Terence Stace, English-American philosopher, academic, and civil servant (d. 1967)"]}, {"page": "1886", "response": ["* November 17 \u2013 Walter Terence Stace, British philosopher (d. 1967)"]}, {"page": "Morality", "response": ["Moral philosophy includes meta-ethics, which studies abstract issues such as moral ontology and moral epistemology, and normative ethics, which studies more concrete systems of moral decision-making such as deontological ethics and consequentialism.

Agents may possess free will, according to the conditional analysis, even if determinism is true. Critics point out that compatibilists are making a circular argument here: An agent is free if an agent is free.
