St. Ives had been dominated by the influence of Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth but by 1956 the \"Middle Generation\" of Peter Lanyon, Patrick Heron, Bryan Wynter and Terry Frost were becoming well established in Britain and were soon to be known in New York City.  He accepted Peter Lanyon's suggestion to join the Newlyn Society of Artists and had his first one-man exhibition there in 1958. His work, inspired by the Cornish light, land and seascape led him to a new understanding of tone and temper. Henry Moore encouraged him, Francis Bacon gave him canvasses, and working within this rich atmosphere, Benjamin produced work which became more expansive and colourful, and gradually more abstract in concept sliding into Abstract Expressionism."]}, {"page": "Lippy Lipshitz", "response": ["Lipshitz exhibited again at the A.I.A.

The severe injuries that she had received as a worker at the Hayes Munitions Factory necessitated many more operations and her health was not improved by living in a polluted London. In the post war period St Ives maintained a vibrant writing and artistic community with whom Lethbridge became involved in part, because of her enjoyment of bohemian values but also as a benefactor. She provided the abstract painter Sven Berlin and his wife with a cottage and a studio and championed Bryan Wynter, the latter subsequently marrying her daughter Suzanne in 1949.\"Sven Berlin 1911 - 1999\", Finishing Publications Ltd, Herts, UK.
