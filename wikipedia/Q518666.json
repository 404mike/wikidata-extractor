He won five general elections (1967, 1979, 1986, 1991 and 1995) and serving three non-consecutive terms of office from 1967 to 1971, again from 1979 to 1983 and again from 1986 until his death in 1995. Stoutt also served as a parliamentarian in the Legislative Council from 1957 until 1967 prior to the adoption of the 1967 constitution,  and at the time of his death was thought to be the longest serving Parliamentarian in the Caribbean. He was a founder of and the leader of the United Party, but after splitting from the party in 1971 went on to found the Virgin Islands Party.\nSince Stoutt's death in 1995, a public holiday in the British Virgin Islands has been declared annually on the first Monday in the month of March in memory of his birthday.\nThe H. Lavity Stoutt Community College in Tortola bears his name.  Stoutt himself left school after his primary school education, and obituary writers have suggested that it was his own lack of a formal education which so strongly inspired him to create and promote opportunities for BVIslanders to further their own educations.During his lifetime, Lavity Stoutt was extremely fond of the quote from Proverbs 29:18 - \"Where there is no vision, the people perish\", a phrase he would recite frequently when arguing in favour of development projects.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of heads of state and government who died in office", "response": ["|  Hamilton Lavity Stoutt|| 1995 |||| Chief Minister"]}, {"page": "H.

The governor represents the monarch and the British government, as well as presiding over the cabinet, but is also required to swear an oath to the constitution of the territory, which Penfold believed complicated the governor's role as a representative of the British government. Among Penfold's duties as governor was the purchase of an aeroplane to assist in combating drug smuggling through the territory and assisting in establishing the British Virgin Islands as an offshore financial centre; the number of registered companies in the Islands rose to 35,000 (more than double the population) during Penfold's tenure.Cullimore, pp. 25\u201326. As governor, Penfold became increasingly aware of growing resentment among the citizens of the British dependencies regarding their rights of entry and abode in the UK. He proposed that the territories be renamed \"British overseas territories\", and that their citizens be given equal rights of entry and abode\u2014proposals that were eventually accepted.Cullimore, p. 30. At the end of Penfold's term, a constitutional crisis arose after Chief Minister Hamilton Lavity Stoutt died suddenly. The constitution of the territory contained no provision for the chief minister dying in office, and the death left the governing party without a majority in the assembly, so Penfold asked Deputy Chief Minister Ralph O'Neal to become \"Chief Minister ad interim\" to provide political stability.Cullimore, p. 28. Penfold was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1995 Birthday Honours for his service in the British Virgin Islands."]}, {"page": "H.

In 1993 the College moved into a new three-storey facility at its Paraquita Bay Campus, where it still principally resides.
