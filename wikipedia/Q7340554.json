Sinclair started his career in the youth system at Luton Town, signing a professional contract in July 2007. He was loaned out to Conference Premier club Salisbury City in January 2008, until the end of the 2007\u201308 season. On returning to his parent club in May 2008, Sinclair was released, and joined Salisbury on a permanent basis later that month. Injury disrupted his time at the club, playing 54 games during his two-and-a-half-year spell. \nSinclair left Salisbury when the club were relegated two divisions after a breach of rules on unpaid debts, and he joined Stevenage of League Two on a free transfer in June 2010. Stevenage earned promotion to League One in his first season with the club. Following a brief loan spell at Aldershot Town in March 2012, Sinclair left Stevenage in June 2012, only to rejoin the club three months later. He was loaned out once again to Aldershot in November 2012. He left Stevenage by mutual consent in January 2013, and signed for Salisbury City, his second spell at the club. Sinclair was a part of the team that gained promotion to the Conference Premier during the 2012\u201313 season. \nHe signed for Forest Green Rovers in June 2014, helping them earn promotion to the Football League during the 2016\u201317 season. In the summer of 2017, Sinclair elected to play semi-professionally for Oxford City and then in November 2018 joined another semi-professional team in the form of National League South club Hemel Hempstead Town. He signed for hometown club Bedford Town in July 2020, where he spent one season. Sinclair made the transition from playing to coaching, joining Dunstable Town as a first-team coach in October 2021 before being appointed as manager of Eynesbury Rovers later that month.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Salisbury City F.C.", "response": ["* Rob Sinclair"]}, {"page": "Dean Holdsworth", "response": ["He assembled a number of free signings to replenish his squad: strikers Bradley Bubb and Michael Rankine; midfielders Anthony Pulis and Graeme Montgomery; defenders Aaron Brown and Jamie Collins; and goalkeeper Ross Worner. He also brought in a total of eight loanees in the first half of the season: Jake Taylor, Jordan Brown, Bruno Andrade, Adam Smith, Scott Davies, Jamie Day, Greg Pearson and Charlie Henry. His team proved to be inconsistent, though they did reach the Fourth Round of the League Cup, where they were beaten 3\u20130 by a Manchester United side that included Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Owen, and Antonio Valencia. In the January transfer window he released Graeme Montgomery and Anthony Pulis, whilst making four new loan signings in defenders Troy Brown and Sonny Bradley, midfielder Josh Payne, and striker Charlie Collins. He also recruited defender Chris Doig, and attempted to bolster his side's poor goalscoring record by paying a five figure fee for Cameroonian striker Guy Madjo. He also signed Stefan Payne, Wilko Risser and Josh Payne, as well as loanees Ben Smith, Darren Murphy, Michael Doughty, and Rob Sinclair. To make room for these signings he offloaded Jermaine McGlashan, Jamie Collins, Luke Guttridge, Chris Doig and Aaron Brown.

Andy Drury decided to leave Stevenage in favour of a move back into non-league, joining Luton Town on a free transfer, while both Mark Albrighton and Eddie Odhiambo were released in June 2010. Five players joined the club during the close season. Darius Charles was the first signing of the season, joining Stevenage from Ebbsfleet United for a fee set by a tribunal.

The club's first away game in the Football League ended in a 1\u20130 defeat against Bradford City at Valley Parade. Bradford striker Gareth Evans scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot in the first\u2013half in a game that was \"rough luck on the visitors\" having dominated large parts of the game. Stevenage won their first game of the season a week later, beating Stockport County 3\u20131 at Broadhall Way. Charlie Griffin opened the scoring with a looping header after half an hour, before Michael Bostwick's 30-yard effort found the top corner two minutes before the interval.
