Sueter and Yalden are the earliest players to be recognised as \"wicketkeeper/batsmen\", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone. Sueter played mainly for Hampshire but in his closing seasons he represented Surrey, probably because of temporary residence in the county, though he evidently returned to Hambledon after he finished playing.\nSueter was a carpenter and builder by trade and Arthur Haygarth recorded that above the Hambledon church door in the 1860s was affixed a plaque saying: \"Thomas Sueter and Richard Flood, builders, 1788\".Sueter began playing in the 1760s and made 67 known first-class appearances from the 1772 season to the 1790 season. He is said \"to have been the first (or one of the first) who departed from the custom of the old players, who deemed it a heresy to leave the crease for the ball; but he would get in at it, hit it straight off and straight on, and egad it went as if it had been fired.\"  Sueter was also reckoned an excellent judge of a short run.Like George Leer, Sueter was a fine singer and he belonged to the choir at his parish church. When he died, according to Haygarth, he left behind him a sovereign in order that an anthem should be sung in the church over his coffin; and this was done. Haygarth records that Sueter\u2019s tombstone was still standing in Hambledon churchyard in 1858 with the following inscription:\n\nSacred to the memory of THOMAS SUETER, \nwho departed this life the 17th day of February, 1827, aged 77 years", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hit the ball twice", "response": ["The first definite record of a batsman being dismissed for hitting the ball twice occurred in the Hampshire v Kent match at Windmill Down on 13\u201315 July 1786.

John Minshull (aka Minchin) scored 107 for Dorset's XI in the second innings and this is the earliest century in any class of cricket that has definitely been recorded. There were eleven recorded matches in 1769. Surrey played Berkshire, winning by six runs on Datchet Common. This is the first time Berkshire is recorded as a county team and it became a strong centre of the game in the late 18th century, producing numerous players good enough to take part in major matches. On 28 September, Hambledon defeated Surrey by an innings and 41 runs after their opening batsmen, Tom Sueter and George Leer shared a century partnership of 128 for the first wicket; this was apparently a rare occurrence at the time."]}, {"page": "Billy Beldham", "response": ["Although he was remembered primarily as a fine attacking batsman, Beldham was an all-rounder who took many wickets by operating as a change bowler.

A genuine all-rounder and the earliest known left-hander of note, Nyren was the captain of Hampshire (aka Hambledon) when its team included players like John Small, Thomas Brett and Tom Sueter. Although the records of many matches in which he almost certainly played have been lost, he made 51 known appearances between 1764 and 1784.

On 8\u201312 August of the same year, Harris played for the White Conduit Club against Kent at Bourne Paddock and took six wickets in the match, three in each innings, to help White Conduit to a 164 run victory. White Conduit's big win was due to Tom Walker and Tom Taylor becoming the first players known to score a century in the same innings. Walker made 95* and 102, just missing the honour of becoming the first player to score two centuries in a match.Haygarth, p. 68."]}, {"page": "William Yalden", "response": ["William \"The Yold\" Yalden (1740 \u2013 January 1824) was an English cricketer and, with Tom Sueter, one of the earliest known wicketkeeper/batsmen. Yalden played mainly for Chertsey and Surrey though he was also a regular, sometimes as captain, in England XI teams, particularly in matches against Hampshire. His career began in the 1760s and he is known to have played until 1785.", "In The Cricketers of My Time, Yalden was briefly mentioned in somewhat unfavourable terms by John Nyren whose comments may have had some substance but, on the other hand, it is difficult to believe that the Hambledon players were all as perfect as Nyren portrayed them to be.Nyren, p. 75. The Hampshire teams promoted by the Hambledon Club were very competitive and so, evidently, were their opponents, among whom Yalden was a prominent member, sometimes as captain. Nyren describes Yalden as \"a thin, dark-looking man\" and as \"not a fine, but a very useful and steady batter\". Nyren revered Hambledon's Tom Sueter and Yalden was Sueter's rival as both a wicketkeeper and a batsman, although they played together for Hampshire in 1772. They are the first two players in cricket history to be recognised as \"wicketkeeper/batsmen\", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone. Nyren chose to denigrate Yalden in comparison with his hero Sueter saying that: \"I must place Sueter above Yalden\" (i.e., as a wicketkeeper) and that Yalden \"was in other respects an inferior man to Sueter\". Nyren says that Yalden's \"word was not always to be depended on when he had put a man out\" as \"he would now and then shuffle (sic) and \"resort to trick\". He goes on to assert that Sueter and the other Hambledon players would not do such things because of \"estimation\", \"honour\", \"trust\" and never questioning the decision of the umpire. Nyren's comments are seriously biased but some balance is provided by the editor's introduction to the modern version of the book when he states that \"Yalden \u2013 the England wicketkeeper and captain, no less \u2013 is dismissed in a few words\" while several other notable players are not mentioned at all.Nyren, p. 36 (editor's comments). Elsewhere the editor discusses Nyren's undoubted plagiarism of an earlier work by William Lambert and it is widely agreed that Nyren's account of Hambledon's players is hagiographic, often at the expense of their opponents, and Yalden is one player who was not given a fair hearing in this book.Nyren, p. 31 (editor's comments)."]}, {"page": "1777 English cricket season", "response": ["James Aylward made his record score of 167 in the first England v Hampshire match of the season in June.
