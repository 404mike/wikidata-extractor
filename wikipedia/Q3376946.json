In 1864 he patented a design for a cylindrical tunnelling shield, and obtained a provisional patent in 1868 for an improved design.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Henry Barlow", "response": ["Barlow was born on 10 May 1812 in Woolwich, Kent (now in south-east London), the son of mathematician and physicist Professor Peter Barlow, who taught at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. William Barlow was the younger brother of Peter William Barlow. After a private education, Barlow began to study civil engineering with his father at the age of sixteen. After a year he, went on to a pupillage at the machinery department of the Royal Navy's Woolwich Dockyard close to his family home. He then worked at the London Docks for Henry Robinson Palmer."]}, {"page": "History of the London Underground", "response": ["In 1869, a passage was dug through the London Clay  under the Thames from Great Tower Hill to Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine Lane). A circular  tunnel was dug , using a wrought iron shield, a method that had been patented in 1864 by Peter William Barlow. A railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one side to the other. This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year and the tunnel was converted to pedestrian use, becoming known as the Tower Subway. Construction of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR) was started in 1886 by James Henry Greathead using a development of Barlow's shield. Two  circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today's Monument station) and Elephant and Castle.  From Elephant and Castle, the tunnels were a slightly larger  to Stockwell.The Northern Line, A Short History by M A C Horne (page 9)  This was a legacy of the original intention to haul the trains by cable. The tunnels were bored under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. The original intention to cable-haul the trains changed to electric power when the cable company went bankrupt. A conductor rail energised with +500\u00a0volts DC conductor rail for the northbound tunnel and \u2212500\u00a0volts for the southbound laid between the running rails, though offset from the centreline, powered the electric locomotives that hauled the carriages.  The carriages were fitted with small windows and consequently were nicknamed padded cells.The Northern Line, A Short History by M A C Horne (page 12)  By 1907, the C&SLR had extended from both ends, south to Clapham Common and north to Euston."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Peter William Barlow||20/11/1845||2 February 1809 \u2013 19 May 1885 Engineer"]}]}}
