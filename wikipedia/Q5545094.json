Burke subsequently ordered his battalions into reserve positions north of the previously destroyed village of Kapyong, on the main road from Seoul to the east coast.O'Neill 1985, p. 129. Intelligence indicated that a new PVA offensive was imminent, and while the brigade settled in to rest it remained on three hours' notice to move to support IX Corps.O'Neill 1985, p. 131. Having been on operations continuously for the past seven months, the British intended to relieve the bulk of the brigade during its period in reserve. The two British battalions\u2014the Argylls and the Middlesex\u2014would be replaced by two fresh battalions from Hong Kong, while Burke and the headquarters of 27th Brigade would be replaced by Brigadier George Taylor and the headquarters of 28th Brigade in late April. The Canadians were scheduled to transfer to the newly raised 25th Canadian Brigade in May as part of Canada's increased commitment to the war. Advance parties from Brigade Headquarters and the Argylls departed for Seoul en route for Hong Kong on 19 April, while the remaining British battalions were scheduled to depart two weeks later.Breen 1992, p. 18. 3 RAR would not be rotated and remained a part of the brigade for the entire war, operating on an individual reinforcement system instead.Breen 1992, p. 21.", "27th Brigade was replaced by the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade and Brigadier George Taylor took over command of the new formation on 26 April. With the PVA offensive losing momentum, the new Commonwealth formation was subsequently pulled back into IX Corps reserve to the southwest of Kapyong, near the junction of the Pukhan and Chojon rivers. 3 RAR was transferred to 28th Brigade, while the 1st Battalion, The King's Own Scottish Borderers and the 1st Battalion, The King's Shropshire Light Infantry replaced the Argylls and Middlesex regiments. Later, the Patricias were transferred to the newly arrived 25th Canadian Brigade on 27 May.O'Neill 1985, p. 166.Johnston 2003, p. 107. After protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, agreement had been reached to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced by the various Commonwealth contingents. The 1st Commonwealth Division was formed on 28 July 1951, with the division including the 25th Canadian, 28th British Commonwealth and 29th British Infantry Brigades under the command of Major General James Cassels, and was part of US I Corps.Grey 1988, pp. 192\u2013195. For many of the Australians Kapyong was to be their last major battle before completing their period of duty and being replaced, having endured much hard fighting, appalling weather and the chaos and confusion of a campaign that had ranged up and down the length of the Korean Peninsula. Most had served in the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) during the Second World War and this combat experience had proven vital.Breen 1992, p. 104. Regardless, casualties had been heavy, and since the battalion's arrival from Japan in September 1950 the Australians had lost 87 killed, 291 wounded and five captured.O'Neill 1985, p. 158."]}, {"page": "George Taylor", "response": ["George Taylor may refer to:", "*George Taylor (Alamo defender) (c. 1816\u20131836), soldier in Texas army, died in the Battle of the Alamo", "*George Taylor (British Army officer) (1905\u20131994), served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Mau Mau campaign", "*George Taylor (Medal of Honor) (1830\u20131893), American Civil War sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "*George Taylor (Canadian politician) (1840\u20131919), Canadian House of Commons member", "*George Taylor (Pennsylvania politician) (c. 1716\u20131781), signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence", "*George Taylor (New York Representative) (1820\u20131894), American Congressman from New York", "*George Taylor (Connecticut politician) (1802\u20131881), politician and physician", "*George Taylor (Australian politician) (1861\u20131935), Australian labour leader and member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia", "*George Taylor (Australian rules footballer) (1876\u20131953), Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne", "*George Taylor (manager) (1853\u20131911), American baseball manager", "*George Taylor (cricketer) (1909\u20131986), English cricket player", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131982), played in the Football League for Brentford and Millwall", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1907) (1907\u2013?), English football outside right, who played for Coventry City F.C. in the 1930s", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u2013?), English football left half", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20131982), Scottish footballer, played for Aberdeen and Plymouth Argyle", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1920) (1920\u20131983), English football goalkeeper, played for West Ham United", "*George Taylor (footballer, born 1948), Scottish footballer, played for Grimsby Town", "*George Taylor (Negro leagues) (1869\u2013?), Negro leagues first baseman", "*George Taylor (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s, 1910s and 1920s", "*George Taylor (DC Comics), fictional character in the DC Comics universe, chief editor of the Daily Star", "*George Taylor (artist) (1914\u20131996), English commercial artist", "*Sir George Taylor (botanist) (1904\u20131993), British botanist, from 1956 to 1971 director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew", "*George Taylor (gardener) (1803\u20131891), introduced celery to the United States", "*George Taylor (priest) (died 1811), Anglican priest", "*Taylor (Planet of the Apes), Colonel George Taylor, fictional hero of the first two films of the original Planet of the Apes series played by Charlton Heston"]}, {"page": "Brigadier George Taylor CBE, DSO & Bar, KHS", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Taylor (British Army officer)   "]}, {"page": "Brigadier George Taylor", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Taylor (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "George Taylor (soldier)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Taylor (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Operation Dauntless", "response": ["By 17 April, the first phase of Operation Dauntless had been successfully achieved. On the east flank of the advance, the British 27th Brigade of IX Corps had cleared minor PVA 40th Army forces from Paegun Mountain above the headwaters of the Kap'yong River to reach the Utah Line on 16 April. The ROK 19th Regiment, 6th Division was currently relieving the brigade, which, except for the New Zealand artillery assigned to stay forward in support of the ROK, was withdrawing into corps reserve near Kap'yong town. The relief in part was in preparation for the second phase of Dauntless in which IX Corps would make a full advance with the ROK 6th and 1st Marine Divisions. While in reserve, the British brigade also was to begin rotating units under a British policy calling for annual replacement. The 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, was to be replaced on 23 April, by the 1st Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers; on the 25th, brigade headquarters itself was to leave the line and be replaced by a new staff and commander from Hong Kong. The brigade at that time would become the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade under the command of Brigadier George Taylor."]}]}}
