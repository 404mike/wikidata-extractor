The British journalist Rupert Wingfield-Hayes of BBC described him as \"far more right wing than most of his predecessors\". Since 1997, as the bureau chief of the \"Institute of Junior Assembly Members Who Think About the Outlook of Japan and History Education\", Abe led the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform. In 2007, he denied to reporters that Japan forced women into sexual slavery during World War II. On his official homepage, he questions the extent to which coercion was applied toward the comfort women, dismissing South Korean positions on the issue as foreign interference in Japanese domestic affairs. In a Diet session on 6 October 2006, Abe revised his statement regarding comfort women and said that he accepted the report issued in 1993 by the sitting cabinet secretary, Y\u014dhei K\u014dno, where the Japanese government officially acknowledged the issue. Later in the session, Abe stated his belief that Class-A war criminals are not criminals under Japan's domestic law.Abe clarifies views on 'history issue,' reaffirms apologies, Daily Yomiuri, 7 October 2006.
