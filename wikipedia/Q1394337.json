He called his style \"The New Music\". Critics praised \"Garden of Weed\" \"Serenade for a Wealthy Widow\" and the Bach-influenced \"Dodging a Divorcee\", but the British public was baffled. Foresythe's music found a warmer reception in America, resulting in collaborations with Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Earl Hines. Artie Shaw recorded \"Interlude in B-flat\" in 1935 with the unusual ensemble of a string quartet, a jazz rhythm section, and Shaw on clarinet and saxophone.

He served as secretary of a new Advisory Committee on the Welfare of Colonial Peoples in the United Kingdom, a Colonial Office initiative to assume direct responsibility for housing colonial students. After the war he worked to recruit African nurses for the National Health Service. "]}]}}
