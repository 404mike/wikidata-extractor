He married Glenys Maria Hare at Neath, in 1958.\nBurgess came from Port Talbot, and worked as a drama teacher for most of his adult life. He dedicated a lot of his time to helping his father care for his invalid mother, and it wasn't until after she had died that Burgess became a professional actor at 47 years of age, moving from Wales to the south east of England. His first professional role was in a film starring his boyhood friend Richard Burton, who had helped him into the profession. Burton and Burgess had remained great friends, and  a series of letters written by  the screen legend to his old friend, have previously been exhibited at the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth. They included an invitation to Burton's 50th birthday party in 1975, from his then wife Elizabeth Taylor.Burgess went on to feature in The Professionals, The Sandbaggers, and The Elephant Man, and played the recurring role of Flambeau in Father Brown.\nSadly his second career was to be a short one. On the evening of 3 November 1980, Dennis Burgess was driving to his home in Chesham when he suffered a massive heart attack and veered off the road. He was found dead at the wheel of his car, in the middle of a cricket pitch, in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England. He was 54.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Sandbaggers", "response": ["John Tower Gibbs (Dennis Burgess), \"C\" (series 3 only)"]}, {"page": "Triangle (1981 TV series)", "response": ["* Dennis Burgess \u2013 George Terson"]}, {"page": "Flambeau (character)", "response": ["*Dennis Burgess \u2013 Father Brown (1974 TV series)"]}, {"page": "Mission of the Darians", "response": ["* Dennis Burgess \u2014 Neman"]}, {"page": "Massacre in Rome", "response": ["* Dennis Burgess as SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer Hellmuth Dobbrick"]}, {"page": "Burgess (surname)", "response": ["* Dennis Burgess, British actor"]}, {"page": "List of The Sandbaggers characters", "response": ["The Head of SIS when the series begins, code-named \"C\". A diplomat by training, Greenley is initially treated with suspicion by Burnside. Over the course of the first two series, Burnside comes to both trust and become fond of Greenley, who has the difficult task of balancing political as well as security concerns. Greenley becomes an almost paternal figure to Burnside, often protecting him from the consequences of his worst instincts and keeping the peace between Burnside and Matthew Peele, the deputy chief. He retires at the end of the second series as a result of angina, and Burnside is disappointed to see him replaced, in \"Operation Kingmaker,\" by the less benevolent John Tower Gibbs (Dennis Burgess), who remains C for the rest of the series. Greenley is played by Richard Vernon.", "Introduced in the last episode of the second series (\"Operation Kingmaker\"), John Tower Gibbs replaces Sir James Greenley as C and remains in that capacity until the end of the series. Gibbs is a career intelligence officer, former head of the Washington and Bonn Stations and working with the Joint Intelligence Commission when he is appointed C. He and Burnside have an antagonistic relationship from the start, stemming from an altercation they had when Burnside was a Sandbagger and Gibbs was head of Bonn Station. Unlike his predecessor, Gibbs refers to Burnside only by his surname (while Greenley called him \"Neil\"), disapproves of his methods, and is suspicious of the special relationship with the CIA, preferring to see it phased out. For his part, Burnside views Gibbs as a tyrant who will stifle his (Burnside's) ability to run his directorate. They clash throughout the third series, but in one episode where Burnside is on leave and Caine is Acting D-Ops, Caine and Gibbs work very well together. He is played by Dennis Burgess."]}, {"page": "Father Brown (1974 TV series)", "response": ["* Dennis Burgess as Hercule Flambeau"]}, {"page": "Wuthering Heights (1978 TV serial)", "response": ["*Mr Linton \u2013 \tDennis Burgess"]}, {"page": "Off to Philadelphia in the Morning (TV series)", "response": ["*Dennis Burgess ...
