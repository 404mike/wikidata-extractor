After making one substitute appearance he had a chance to establish himself in the first team following a three-game suspension to Tyrone Marsh.

Ribeiro planned to strengthen his team further though, and was hopeful of signing another goalkeeper, striker, winger and left back. He achieved one of his targets by bringing in young Birmingham City striker Alex Jones on loan until January. Ribeiro went on to achieve his first win as Vale manager with a 2\u20130 victory over a poor Southend United side on 13 August. Despite only joining the club six weeks ago, Carlos Saleiro agreed to have his contract cancelled by mutual consent as he \"found it difficult to adjust to life in the country\". The good results kept coming though, and impressive young defender Nathan Smith scored a headed goal as Vale extending their run of league clean sheets to three games with a 1\u20130 win over Rochdale. In a bizarre revelation, The Sun newspaper reported that Mario Balotelli could join the Vale on loan; the story was ridiculed by local journalists and fans on social media. Vale conceded their first league goal in a 1\u20130 defeat at Swindon Town on 20 August, despite Ribeiro's view that Vale were the better side on the day. Northampton Town boss Rob Page was allowed to sign JJ Hooper on a five-month loan deal starting from 22 August, after the striker began the season on the right-wing for Vale. Later that night a grenade was found at Vale Park, which was later determined to be a training device from World War II. With Kiko and Yates both injured, Ribeiro signed Liverpool Academy left-back Sam Hart on a season-long loan. He also signed 29-year old former Northern Ireland striker Martin Paterson, who had been a free agent after leaving Blackpool. Vale continued their excellent start to the campaign by beating Scunthorpe United 3\u20131; substitutes Paterson, Hart and Amoros all made their first appearances for the club in the game, with the latter two players making their first appearances in professional football.

Manager Bruno Ribeiro praised him after the match, saying that \"he was fantastic. He scored two goals and worked hard.\u00a0... He is one more option for a winger\". His performance won him a place on the Football League Paper's League One Team of the Day. Jones said that he enjoyed playing out of position at right-wing for Port Vale as Ribeiro allowed him a free creative role with few defensive duties, and he also admitted he hoped to extend the loan as he did not suit the style of play at his parent club. He was nominated for the League One Player of the Month award for August and September after scoring six goals in eight games. By the end of his loan spell, Jones had scored ten goals from 21 matches.
