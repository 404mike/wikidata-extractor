After returning to England, he played for Retford United and Heanor Town, ending the latter as their top goalscorer in the 2014/2015 season. He then spent the next season at Alfreton Town where he was also top goalscorer. This earned him his first full-time move to National League side Gateshead; having scored 9 goals in 18 starts by January 2017, this alerted him to the management team at Grimsby Town, in turn earning him a move into professional football. He then moved to League One side Shrewsbury Town in the following January transfer window.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["After promotion, manager, Paul Hurst, released a number of players, many of whom were pivotal to the previous season's promotion push.
