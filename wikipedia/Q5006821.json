His most outstanding achievement was the discovery of cimetidine, a drug used to combat stomach ulcers, when he was working at Smith Kline and French. He has received many awards and much recognition for his scientific pursuits over the years.  He now lives near London and is a professor at University College London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "H2 receptor antagonist", "response": ["Cimetidine was the prototypical histamine H2-receptor antagonist from which later drugs were developed.
