He began his career as a stone-mason, notoriously working by both day and night. He had been taught to play the dulcimer by a lodger at the age of about fourteen, but it was not until he was about thirty that he seriously began to study music, becoming both a performer and a composer.His works include a number of anthems and hymn tunes, such as \"Gethsemane\" (Lleuad yr Oes, 1827), which was arranged by Rowland Huw Pritchard.He died in 1855 in Llanelli, and was buried in Mynydd-bach cemetery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
