He made 32 appearance for Yorkshire County Cricket Club from 1865 to 1880. He also played four matches of first-class cricket for the \"United England Eleven\" (1866\u20131869), three games for the \"North of England\" (1867\u20131869), four for the \"United North of England Eleven\" (1870) plus one for the \"Players\" (1871).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["With the player dispute resolved, Yorkshire won all seven of their matches in 1867, defeating Surrey, Lancashire and Cambridgeshire. As a result, the sporting press proclaimed Yorkshire to be the \"Champion County\" for the first time. The following year, John Thewlis scored the first century for Yorkshire in first-class cricket, against Surrey at The Oval; in 1869, Joseph Rowbotham became the first man to score two centuries in a season for Yorkshire. Yorkshire won four games in both 1868 and 1869; one sports publication regarded Yorkshire as equal champions in the latter year. The team won six out of seven in 1870 to be acclaimed as Champion County again. Much of Yorkshire's success in these years came from the bowling combination of George Freeman and Tom Emmett."]}, {"page": "Perfect season", "response": ["Since tables of results have been kept in 1864,Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records; pp. 53 to 67.  the only team to have competed a true perfect season \u2013 winning outright every game \u2013 was Yorkshire in 1867 when led by George Freeman's and Tom Emmett's deadly fast bowling on uncovered and unrolled pitches, they won all seven county games."]}, {"page": "Tom Emmett", "response": ["Born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, Emmett first joined Yorkshire when almost 25 as a professional fast left-arm bowler with a near roundarm action, though in his later years he took to bowling slow-medium. Once discovered, however, Emmett climbed almost immediately to the top of the cricketing tree, playing for England against Surrey & Sussex in Tom Lockyer's benefit match at the Oval in 1867, his second season. An even greater bowler, George Freeman, was approaching his best at the same time, and, from 1867 to the end of 1871, they dominated the English bowling scene. After 1871, however, business commitments took Freeman away from first-class cricket, but Emmett stayed on and found another able colleague in the excellent Allen Hill. In later years, Emmett shared the Yorkshire bowling duties with George Ulyett, Billy Bates, Ted Peate and Bobby Peel. He called his most famous delivery the \"sostenuter\": after pitching on leg the ball would break back a long way to take the off-stump. As time went on, Emmett's pace deserted him."]}, {"page": "Roger Iddison", "response": ["In 1869, Iddison played in 27 first-class matches and made 1,059 runs.
