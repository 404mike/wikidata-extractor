They introduced the TR-808 rhythm machine to popular music, and the band would be a major influence on early British synth-pop acts. 1978 also saw the release of UK band the Human League's d\u00e9but single \"Being Boiled\", while American post-punk band Devo began moving towards a more electronic sound. At this point synth-pop gained some critical attention, but made little impact on the commercial charts."]}, {"page": "Clark", "response": ["*Andy Clark (musician), British musician"]}, {"page": "Drama of Exile", "response": ["Aura Records offered to finance one album recorded in London and produced by Philippe Quilichini.

Over ten years later, Major Tom is described as a \"junkie\", which has been interpreted as parallel to Bowie's own struggles with drug addiction throughout the 1970s. In 1990, Bowie acknowledged \"Ashes to Ashes\" as a confrontation of his past: \"You have to accommodate your pasts within your persona. You have to understand why you went through them... You cannot just ignore them to put them out of your mind or pretend they didn't happen, or just say, 'Oh, I was different then. Musically, \"Ashes to Ashes\" is built around a guitar synthesiser theme by Chuck Hammer, augmented by Andy Clark's synthesiser. Like \"Space Oddity\" before it, the song was built in stages, and features layers of instruments in its mix. \"Fashion\" is reminiscent of Bowie's former single \"Golden Years\", with its mix of funk and reggae. It evolved out of a reggae \"spoof\" started by Clark on his synthesiser and features guitar \"squeals\" from Fripp. Apart from being a dance track, the song provokes elements of fascism, with lyrics such as \"we are the goon squad\" and \"turn to the left, turn to the right\".
