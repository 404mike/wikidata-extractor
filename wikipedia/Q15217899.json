The album is intended to be a companion piece to U2's previous record, Songs of Innocence (2014). Whereas its predecessor explored the group members' adolescence in Ireland in the 1970s, Songs of Experience thematically is a collection of letters written by lead vocalist Bono to people and places closest to his heart. The album features guest appearances from several musical acts, including Haim, Kendrick Lamar, and Lady Gaga.", "While touring in Russia with his electronic music duo Lamb, musician Andy Barlow received an offer to produce for U2. The following week, he flew to Monaco to join the group for what he described as a \"two-week tryout\". Barlow was surprised by how receptive the band members were to his ideas and how quickly they trusted him, particularly Bono. One of the first tasks that Barlow was given was helping the band advance \"The Little Things That You Give You Away\" past the idea stage, something that numerous producers before him had failed to do. After the session in Monaco, Barlow was asked to join the group in Vancouver for six weeks from April\u2013May 2015 for another trial period as they rehearsed for the Innocence + Experience Tour at the Pacific Coliseum. Producer Jolyon Thomas also joined them as the band used a mobile recording studio. Among the in-progress songs previewed to The New York Times during rehearsals were \"Red Flag Day\", \"Civilisation\", and \"Instrument Flying\". Prior to the tour's opening show on 14 May, the Edge speculated that the band could complete the album by the end of the year if they committed themselves during their limited downtime after the tour. Comparing the group's in-progress material to their 1993 album Zooropa, which was recorded between legs of their Zoo TV Tour, the Edge said the Songs of Experience songs were \"a lot more developed\".", "*Andy Barlow\u00a0\u2013 additional keyboards , programming , sound design ", "*Andy Barlow\u00a0\u2013 production , engineering , mixing , additional production "]}, {"page": "The Autobiography (Vic Mensa album)", "response": ["* \"Heaven on Earth\" contains an interpolation of \"Heaven\", written by Andy Barlow and Lou Rhodes."]}]}}
