His grandfather Graham, great-uncle James Hamilton Doggart, father Hubert and uncle Peter all played first-class cricket.\nHe was a former headmaster of Caldicott School in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire. Doggart announced in February 2017 that he intended, at the age of 56, to resign from his position as Head of Caldicott School with effect from July 2017. \nIn February 2017 it was revealed that a former mentor of his, John Smyth, had engaged in sadistic physical abuse by violently beating young men. In April 2017 it was alleged that Doggart had, after being the victim of Smyth's abusive beatings as a young man, also administered severe beatings alongside Smyth. In May 2017 the school announced that \"due to ill health Simon is no longer able to lead the school\", and an acting Head, Theroshene Naidoo, took over with immediate effect.
