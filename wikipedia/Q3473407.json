She performed on stage in the early 20th century. Her best-known single-act performance was in The Clod, a stage production in which she played an uneducated woman who lived on a farm during the American Civil War.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bad Girl (1931 film)", "response": ["*Sarah Padden as Mrs. Gardner"]}, {"page": "1967 in film", "response": ["** Sarah Padden, 86, American actress, Women Won't Tell, The Midnight Lady"]}, {"page": "Night of January 16th", "response": ["|Sarah Padden"]}, {"page": "The Power and the Glory (1933 film)", "response": ["* Sarah Padden as Henry's Wife"]}, {"page": "Clara Blandick", "response": ["In 1939, Blandick landed her most memorable minor role \u2013 Aunt Em in MGM's classic The Wizard of Oz. Though it was a small part (Blandick filmed all her scenes in a single week), the character was an important symbol of protagonist Dorothy's quest to return home to her beloved aunt and uncle. (Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are the only characters from the beginning of the movie, in black-and-white Kansas, not to have alter ego characters in the Land of Oz.) Blandick beat May Robson, Janet Beecher, and Sarah Padden for the role, and earned $750 per week. Some believed Aunt Em's alter ego was to be Glinda, the Good Witch of the North but the studio opted to use different actresses for each role. The reason was they wanted someone younger looking to contrast the good witch from the bad witches, although Billie Burke, who played Glinda, was only eight years younger. Blandick is only credited in the movie's closing credits."]}, {"page": "Ramrod (film)", "response": ["*Sarah Padden as Mrs. Parks"]}, {"page": "Big Jim McLain", "response": ["* Sarah Padden as Mrs. Lexiter"]}, {"page": "House by the River", "response": ["* Sarah Padden as Mrs. Beach"]}, {"page": "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1932 film)", "response": ["* Sarah Padden as Mrs. Cobb"]}, {"page": "The Mad Monster", "response": ["*Sarah Padden as The Grandmother"]}, {"page": "It's in the Bag!
