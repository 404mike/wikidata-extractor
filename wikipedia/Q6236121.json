Scientists, however, noted its harmful effects. In 1873 James Dewar and John Gray McKendrick documented that frogs grew sluggish, birds gasped for breath, and rabbits' blood showed decreased levels of oxygen after exposure to \"ozonized air\", which \"exercised a destructive action\". Sch\u00f6nbein himself reported that chest pains, irritation of the mucous membranes and difficulty breathing occurred as a result of inhaling ozone, and small mammals died. In 1911, Leonard Hill and Martin Flack stated in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B that ozone's healthful effects \"have, by mere iteration, become part and parcel of common belief; and yet exact physiological evidence in favour of its good effects has been hitherto almost entirely wanting\u00a0... The only thoroughly well-ascertained knowledge concerning the physiological effect of ozone, so far attained, is that it causes irritation and \u0153dema of the lungs, and death if inhaled in relatively strong concentration for any time.\""]}, {"page": "Henry Drummond (evangelist)", "response": ["In 1880 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

The first known ERG was recorded by the Swedish physiologist Alarik Frithiof Holmgren, who recorded it in 1865 on an amphibian retina. However, he failed to understand his findings accurately. He thought the responses he recorded were from the optic nerve instead of the retina. The first human ERG was recorded in 1877 by Scottish chemist and physicist Sir James Dewar. James Dewar and John Gray McKendrick independently suggested that the biological potential was from retina. In 1908, Einthoven and Jolly divided the ERG response into three components: A-wave, B-wave, and C-wave. in 1941 American psychologist Lorraine Riggs introduced a contact lens electrode for ERG recording. Many of Ragnar Granit's observations became the basis of ERG understanding, for which he was awarded the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine."]}, {"page": "Royal Institution Christmas Lectures", "response": ["| John Gray McKendrick", "| John Gray McKendrick"]}, {"page": "Cargill Gilston Knott", "response": ["He was appointed as an assistant in Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University in 1879 and held this post until 1883, when he left to take up a post at Tokyo Imperial University.
