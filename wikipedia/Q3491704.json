As the drummer he was a core member of the band, and performed on their top five hit \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\" and on all subsequent recordings. The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band appeared in the Beatles' 1967 TV film Magical Mystery Tour and also in the ground-breaking ITV television series Do Not Adjust Your Set, which featured future Monty Python members Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin.\nAs a solo artist Smith also toured with Eric Clapton and Elton John. Smith was a close friend of ex-Beatle George Harrison for many years, and designed the cover for his Gone Troppo album (1982). He also sang the theme song of and appeared in the Harrison-backed film Bullshot (1983), a HandMade Films production. Harrison wrote and recorded a song about Smith called \"His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)\", released on his album Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). The recording features the vocal antics of \"Legs\" himself, who also tap-danced in Elton John's song \"I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself\" from the album Honky Ch\u00e2teau (1972), and is credited for the tap-dance interlude in Todd Rundgren's song \"Useless Begging\" from the album Todd (1974). He is also featured in the song \"Legs Larry at Television Centre\" on John Cale's 1972 album The Academy in Peril, for which he provides the voice of a television director.\nOn 28 January 2006, with other surviving members of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Smith played a reunion concert at the London Astoria. A countrywide tour, which began in Ipswich and ended with two shows at the Shepherd's Bush Empire with Adrian Edmonson and Phill Jupitus, followed during November 2006. The Shepherd's Bush Empire shows were filmed for TV broadcast by the BBC and also released on DVD. A further sold-out concert at the London Astoria in June 2008 saw Smith perform with the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band where his 'Mr Wonderful' stage persona was a highlight of the concert.In March 2009, Smug Records released \"Legs\" Larry Smith's \u2013 'Call Me, Adolf!', a five-track digital EP produced by Gus Dudgeon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Keith Moon", "response": ["Early in the Who's career, Moon got to know the Beatles. He would join them at clubs, forming a particularly close friendship with Ringo Starr. Moon later became friends with Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band members Vivian Stanshall and \"Legs\" Larry Smith, and the trio would drink and play practical jokes together. Smith remembers one occasion where he and Moon tore apart a pair of trousers, with an accomplice later looking for one-legged trousers. In the early 1970s Moon helped Stanshall with his \"Radio Flashes\" radio show for BBC Radio 1, filling in for the vacationing John Peel.

The production won rave reviews, then premiered in London on 14 October 2011. It also drew praise from Innes and Adrian Edmondson who were in the audience. On 25 March 2013, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Stanshall's birth, Livesley was joined by Innes, Rick Wakeman, Danny Thompson, Rodney Slater, Sam Spoons, Vernon Dudley Bowhay-Nowell, 'Legs' Larry Smith and John Otway, to perform Sir Henry at Rawlinson End at the Bloomsbury Theatre.

At this point the band, which then had a revolving membership of anything up to a dozen players at a time, largely performed a dada-influenced, deliberately shambolic, comedic repertoire of trad-jazz cover versions at local public houses and college events, to the delight and occasional bemusement of audiences. Innes had met the band's co-founders Vivian Stanshall and Rodney Slater some time earlier when they and bandmate \"Legs\" Larry Smith were studying at the Central School of Art,John Albert Walker (1994).

Innes' induction into the band proved to be fundamental to their eventual success when he brought a more focused and disciplined musical direction to their efforts, with his talents as a composer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist. At the band's creative peak in 1968 and 1969, Innes, alone and together with Stanshall, composed most of the band's original material, including his solo composition (and sole Bonzos hit) \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\", (produced by Apollo C. Vermouth, a collective alias for Paul McCartney and Gus Dudgeon), and \"Death Cab for Cutie\" (with lyrics by Stanshall), which featured in the Beatles' film Magical Mystery Tour (1967).

The line-up changed again later that year with the departure of Parry (who would later go on to be a founder member of The Pasadena Roof Orchestra), and the final 'classic' Bonzos band member, \"Legs\" Larry Smith, joined to replace the outgoing Lewitt.

While Smith's musical input at this point was, by his own admission, limited, he still brought a keen sense of showmanship to the Bonzos; strongly influenced by the movie The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond, Larry adopted the name 'Legs' and took up tap-dancing, a skill he developed to such an entertaining level that it would later earn him a solo 'tap-dance extravaganza' spot in the band's stage show.", "Our trumpeter then was Bob Kerr, great player, and a fun guy. But he was friends with (songwriter and producer) Geoff Stephens, who'd made \"Winchester Cathedral\" with session men. And he knew Bob, so he rang Bob up saying: 'What am I going to do? \"Winchester Cathedral\"'s a hit, and I've got no band to promote it.'  So Bob came, flushed with excitement, to the rest of us at our digs, saying, 'We can be The New Vaudeville Band!' and we said, 'Certainly not, no way!' So, Bob couldn't understand this, so we said, 'Well, go, you go and do it then, if you want to. Go, never darken our towels again!', kind of thing. But the next thing, on Top of the Pops, was the New Vaudeville Band, with the singer looking exactly like Viv, in a sort of lam\u00e9 suit, all the musicians wearing the kind of suits we were wearing, with two-tone shoes. They'd even nicked the cutout comic speaking balloons, which we made out of hardboard, with a fret saw, and painted white, and then wrote, 'Wow, I'm really expressing myself!' to hold over somebody's head while they did a saxophone solo. There was the entire image, and for the next few weeks people were saying to us, 'Hey, you're like that New Vaudeville Band!' And that's when I think Legs Larry Smith said, \"Well, look\u00a0...'\u2014he'd always been arguing for doing some more modern material, so we all said, 'Right, now we start writing our own stuff.' \"Neil Innes, quoted in the radio documentary Big Shot: A Journey Through the Canyons of Vivian Stanshall's Mind (BBC, 2001)", "By December 1967, bassist Vernon Dudley Bowhay-Nowell and drummer Sam Spoons had been summarily fired from the band.
