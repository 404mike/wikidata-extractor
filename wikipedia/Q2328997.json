In response, Surrey made 103 all out in their first-innings, with Brooks taking the wickets of George Elliott and Allen Chandler to finish with figures of 2/10 from twelve overs.  Responding in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 120 all out, with Brooks being dismissed for 3 runs by George Strachan.

In the return fixture at The Oval, Surrey won the toss and elected to bat, making 250 all out in their first-innings, during which Brooks took the wicket of George Jones to finish with figures of 1/45 from 32.1 overs.  Nottinghamshire could then only manage just 97 all out in their first-innings, with him ending the innings not out on 1.  Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire were dismissed for 247, with Brooks himself dismissed for a duck by Ted Barratt.  Requiring 95 for victory, Surrey reached their target with three wickets to spare."]}]}}
