With Ned Bromley and George Muir  being unavailable as they were both away studying, the Saints' team had a rather makeshift appearance with A. A. Fry playing at full-back in place of Muir, alongside George Carter, Frank Bromley replacing his brother as a forward and four players (Stride, Mate, Delamotte and Farwell) making their competitive debut.

Playing at the County Ground in front of a record crowd estimated at between 4,000 and 5,000, who paid entrance fees totalling \u00a363, St. Mary's took the lead after 20 minutes, through Ernie Nicholls who produced \"a stinging shot which no goalkeeper could have saved\" although the Engineers were level by half-time, following a slip by the Saints' captain, George Carter. In the second half, goals from Frank Bromley (\"a cheer rent the air that might have been heard more than a mile away\") and Bob Kiddle (\"the delight of the Southampton people knew no bounds\") gave St. Mary's the victory, thus remaining undefeated in four seasons of Hampshire cup football. The Southampton Times commented that \"Saints never played a better game\"; \"once more, they had walked smiling through their opponents\"."]}]}}
