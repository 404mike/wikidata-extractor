He has a Masters degree in Theology from Brasenose College, Oxford. He is lecturer at Exeter University, and author of Gnostic Philosophy, The Magus of Freemasonry, and Freemasonry and numerous other works on esotericism.Churton has made several television programmes, including Gnostics, a 4-part drama-documentary series made for Channel 4 (UK) by Border TV (together with an accompanying book) which was broadcast in 1987 and repeated in 1990. Churton's studies include critique of heresiologists' perceptions on the role of women in these \"unorthodox\" Christian movements.He has also written about John T. Desaguliers, Rosicrucianism.Churton's biography of Aleister Crowley was released in 2011. Subsequently, he has published four more biographical volumes on Crowley - The Beast in Berlin,  Aleister Crowley in America, Aleister Crowley in India, and Aleister Crowley in England: The Return of the Great Beast, the last biography being due for official release on 7 December 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["Crowley had his first significant mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed that this was the result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognize his bisexuality. At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women\u2014largely with female prostitutes, from one of whom he caught syphilis\u2014but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite their illegality. In October 1897, Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt, president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.", "Biographers Richard B. Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley was a spy for the British secret services and that among other things he joined the Golden Dawn under the command of them to monitor the activities of Mathers, who was known to be a Carlist. Spence suggested that the conflict between Mathers and the London lodge for the temple was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority. Spence has suggested that the purpose of Crowley's trip to Mexico might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Spence has suggested that this trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region's opium trade. Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city.", "Biographer Tobias Churton considered Crowley \"a pioneer of consciousness research\". Hutton noted that Crowley had \"an important place in the history of modern Western responses to Oriental spiritual traditions\", while Sutin thought that he had made \"distinctly original contributions\" to the study of yoga in the West."]}, {"page": "Sabians", "response": ["According to Abu Yusuf Absha al-Qadi, Caliph al-Ma'mun of Baghdad in 830 CE stood with his army at the gates of Harran and questioned the Harranians about what protected religion they belonged to. As they were neither Muslim, Christian, Jewish or Magian, the caliph told them they were non-believers. He said they would have to become Muslims, or adherents of one of the other religions recognized by the Quran by the time he returned from his campaign against the Byzantines or he would kill them.(Churton p. 26) The Harranians consulted with a lawyer, who suggested that they find their answer in the Quran II.59, which said that Sabians were tolerated. It was unknown what the sacred text intended by \"Sabian\" and so they took the name.Tobias Churton pp. 26\u20137"]}, {"page": "Reuben Swinburne Clymer", "response": ["Clymer's claim to being the true leader of American Rosicrucianism put Clymer in direct competition with Harvey Spencer Lewis, founder of the AMORC (Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis).The Invisible History of the Rosicrucians by Tobias Churton, Inner Traditions, p.506-507  This competition was turned to bitter rivalry thanks to disagreement on the role of sex in magic, both sides accusing the other of perverse teachings, while holding that the sexual practices they advocated were enlightened and pure.The Rosucrucians by Christopher McIntosh, Weiser books, p. 128-129  Clymer's views, largely lifted from Randolph, were that bodily fluids produced by a married couple needed to be regularly exchanged for the physical and spiritual health of each partner.\"Randolph, Paschal Beverly\" in Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology, Fifth Edition, ed.

After one manuscript written in 1612, which was intended to be circulated privately escaped their control, the movement took a life in itself, prompting new theories and pure speculations such as those brought forward by \u00c9mile Dantinne (1884\u20131969) who theorised that the origins of the Rosicrucians might have had an Islamic connection. Rosenkreuz started his pilgrimage at the age of sixteen. This led him to Arabia, Egypt and Morocco, where he came into contact with sages of the East who revealed to him the \"universal harmonic science\". After learning Arabic philosophy in Jerusalem, he was led to Damcar. This place remains a mystery \u2014 it did not become Damascus, but is somewhere not too far from Jerusalem. Then he stopped briefly in Egypt. Soon afterwards, he embarked to Fes, a center of philosophical and occult studies, such as the alchemy of Abu-Abdallah, Gabir ben Hayan and Imam Jafar al Sadiq, the astrology and magic of Ali-ash-Shabramallishi, and the esoteric science of Abdarrahman ben Abdallah al Iskari. However, Dantinne states that Rosenkreuz may have found his secrets amongst the Brethren of Purity, a society of philosophers that had formed in Basra (Iraq) in the 10th century. Their doctrine had its source in the study of the ancient Greek philosophers, but it became more neo-Pythagorean. They adopted the Pythagorean tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects. Their theurgy and esoteric knowledge is expounded in an epistolary style in the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity."]}, {"page": "William Breeze", "response": ["In his capacity of head of OTO, Breeze helped many investigators such as Lawrence Sutin (author of Do What Thou Wilt: A Life of Aleister Crowley published in 2000, ), Richard Kaczynski (author of Perdurabo: Life of Aleister Crowley published in 2010 by North Atlantic Books, ), Tobias Churton (author of Aleister Crowley: The Biography published by Watkins Books in 2012, ), and Adam Clayton (author of Netherwood: Last Resort of Aleister Crowley published by Weiser Antiquarian Books in 2012, ), to study OTO, Thelema, Aleister Crowley and related topics using the materials OTO is the guardian of."]}, {"page": "Churton (surname)", "response": ["*Tobias Churton, British scholar"]}, {"page": "Gnostics (TV series)", "response": ["Gnostics was a 1987 4-part drama-documentary series made by Border TV for Channel 4 (UK).
