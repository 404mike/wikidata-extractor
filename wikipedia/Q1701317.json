In the 1980s he studied piano with Grazia Wendling and Eva Serman at the Lucerne School of Music (Musikhochschule Luzern), Switzerland, while attending courses in composition with Edison Denisov and Vinko Globokar.  He continued his composition studies in London at Trinity College of Music, Royal Holloway, University of London and at City University London where he obtained a PhD in composition in 1994. Further studies include composition with Vinko Globokar at the Dartington Summer School and privately with Jonathan Harvey, analysis with Jonathan Cross at the University of Bristol, and conducting with Alan Hazeldine at the Guildhall School of Music And Drama in London.\nSince 1987 Palmer's works has focused on orchestral, instrumental, vocal, chamber music, and electroacoustic composition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oboe", "response": ["* John Palmer, Hinayana (1999), including extended techniquesHinayana, John Palmer"]}, {"page": "Shakuhachi", "response": ["The Australian Shakuhachi Master and composer Jim Franklyn has composed an impressive number of works for solo shakuhachi, also including electronics.

These include Katherine Hoover's Two for Two, Bill Douglas's Karuna, Sophie Lacaze's Archelogos II, Mike Mower's Obstinato and Scareso, Gary Schocker's A Small Sonata for a Large Flute, Lorenzo Ferrero's Ellipse and Shadow Lines, Sonny Burnett's Stone Suite, Catherine McMichael's Baikal Journey and Ennio Morricone's Secrets of the Sahara. Other important works include Tristan Murail's Ethers for solo bass flute and small ensemble, Brian Ferneyhough's Mnemosyne for bass flute and tape, Mario Lavista's Lamento a la muerte de Ra\u00fal Lavista for solo bass flute, Michael Oliva's Moss Garden also for bass flute and tape, John Palmer's Inwards for bass flute and live-electronics, She Cried by Shiva Feshareki, and Marc Tweedie's Zoli, written for renowned flautist Carla Rees. Studies and concert etudes are beginning to appear that address the instrument's many challenges (physical balance, finger technique, air stream, overblowing, etc.). Peter Sheridan has commissioned and arranged new compositions in this area, including a set of 'Etudes for Low Flutes' by Hilary Taggart.  The sixth movement of Claude Bolling's suite for Flute and Jazz Trio, 'Versatile' has the soloist playing the opening melody on a bass flute. Morton Feldman's composition \"Crippled Symmetry\" has a part for the bass flute, as does John Cage's late work \"Seven2\". Hans Pfitzner's 1917 opera Palestrina features an early (true) C bass flute part. Another piece featuring the bass flute is John Mackey's \"The Frozen Cathedral\" (2013) in two separate sections of the piece."]}, {"page": "John Palmer", "response": ["John Palmer may refer to:", "*John Palmer (fl. 1377\u20131394), English politician", "*Sir John Palmer, 5th Baronet (1735\u20131817), British politician", "*John Palmer (1785\u20131840), U.S. Congressman from New York", "*John Palmer (politician) (1842\u20131905), former secretary of state of New York and commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic", "*John Palmer (architect) (1785\u20131846), English architect", "*John Palmer (Bath architect) (1738\u20131817), English architect", "*John Palmer (Unitarian, 1729?\u20131790), English minister, active in the Midlands and north", "*John Palmer (Unitarian, 1742\u20131786), English minister, active in the south", "*John Palmer (Master of Magdalene College) (died 1607), English clergyman and academic", "*John Palmer (Archdeacon of Southern Melanesia) (1837\u20131902)", "*John Palmer (cricketer) (1881\u20131928), English cricketer", "*John Palmer (musician) (born 1943), English musician", "*John Palmer (composer) (born 1959), composer of instrumental and electronic music", "*John Palmer, alias of highwayman Dick Turpin (1705\u20131739)", "*John Palmer (criminal) (1950\u20132015), convicted time-share fraudster, nicknamed \"Goldfinger\"", "*John Palmer, 4th Earl of Selborne (1940\u20132021), British peer and businessman", "*John Palmer (actor) (1742?\u20131798), English actor", "*John Palmer (author) (1885\u20131944), English author", "*John Palmer (Commissary of New South Wales) (1760\u20131833)", "*John Palmer (director) (1943\u20132020), Canadian film and theatre director", "*John Palmer (postal innovator) (1742\u20131818), inventor of the lightweight mail coach", "*John Palmer (colonial administrator) (c. 1650 \u2013 c. 1700), first Englishman to purchase land in the Rockaway Peninsula", "*John Palmer (TV journalist) (1935\u20132013), former NBC News correspondent", "*John Palmer (Home and Away), fictional character", "*John Palmer (1807 ship)", "*John Palmer (1810 ship)", "*John Palmer (1814 schooner), a ship wrecked in Bass Strait in 1818"]}, {"page": "1992 in British music", "response": ["In the field of classical music, British composer John Palmer won the City of Lucerne Cultural Prize for Music.
