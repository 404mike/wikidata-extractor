He signed with Shrewsbury Town in June 2017, and spent the 2017\u201318 season on loan at Chesterfield and Port Vale. He joined Barnet on loan in September 2018, before joining Macclesfield Town after leaving Shrewsbury by mutual consent in January 2019.

On 2 March 2021, Martin's side scored after a 56-pass move, a new British record at the time. At the culmination of the 2020\u201321 season, only Manchester City and Barcelona had a higher average possession percentage in Europe than Martin's MK Dons. His team also had the most touches in the opposition box in League One. Defender Zak Jules commented on Martin's style of play, stating: \"The way we play, we almost demoralise teams. We keep the ball so much that when teams do get the chance to keep possession \u2013 they\u2019ve got no legs and, within no time, we\u2019ve got the ball back and they don\u2019t see the ball again for a while.\""]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["In the January transfer window Aspin allowed two departures, plus Gavin Gunning left the club after rejecting a contract offer and centre-back Tom Anderson was recalled from his loan; incoming were non-league players Dior Angus, Luke Hannant and Callum Howe, as well as loanees Donovan Wilson, Zak Jules, Charlie Raglan and Kyle Howkins. Aspin remarked that the four centre-backs brought in did not cost the club much financially, and that he would have liked to have strengthened in other areas \"but for one reason or another it just hasn't happened\". However he managed to convert Cristian Monta\u00f1o from a winger to a left-back and Antony Kay from a centre-half to a central midfielder, and guided the club to safety with two games to spare.

Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016.

Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall.
