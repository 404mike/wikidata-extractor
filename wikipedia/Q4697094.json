She served as Vice Dean of the Glasgow School for Business and Society, and was also well known for her support of Scottish independence and as a key adviser to the Scottish government and First Minister Alex Salmond on economic and welfare state policies. Ailsa McKay is highlighted as a leading intellectual figure in the campaign for independence in Alex Salmond's 2015 book The Dream Shall Never Die. Both Salmond and his successor Nicola Sturgeon have highlighted McKay's influence on Scottish gender equality policies.\nShe was a member of the board of directors of the left-wing Jimmy Reid Foundation think tank, and was an adviser to the United Nations. With Margunn Bj\u00f8rnholt, she co-edited the book Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics, which was published days before her death. The Ailsa McKay Fellowship, the Ailsa McKay Lecture, one of the foremost honours in feminist economics, and the McKay House at Lenzie Academy are named in her honour.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Ailsa McKay (1963\u20132014), feminist economist, Professor of Economics at Glasgow Caledonian University and United Nations adviser"]}, {"page": "March 5", "response": ["*  2014   \u2013 Ailsa McKay, Scottish economist and academic (b. 1963)"]}, {"page": "Feminist economics", "response": ["Many scholars including Ester Boserup, Marianne Ferber, Julie A.
