Cook also competed in the now more popular Superteams series, as part of the never-defeated 'Athletes' team, who were only finally beaten during the last season of the show in 1985. By now the BBC had decided that the programme was in need of 'freshening up' and had altered the format several times, changing the format of the gym tests to include bar jumps and adding computerised scoring to stop the trend of sliding squat thrusts. The programme was also moved to Portsmouth and took on a naval theme, adding a field gun competition in a bid to boost flagging ratings. The final series of Superteams was duly won by 'Watersports' (a team representing swimming, water-skiing and diving) which was led by Olympic swimmer Robin Brew who excelled at running events and also in the gym tests, where the bar jump became his speciality.", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Robin Brew", "|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#faf6f6;\"|Robin Brew"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Robin Brew"]}, {"page": "Kelly College", "response": ["* Robin Brew, British Olympic Swimmer"]}, {"page": "List of Superstars competitors", "response": ["*Robin Brew"]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 metre individual medley", "response": ["| 2 || 3 || 5 ||align=left| Robin Brew ||align=left|  || 2:04.13 || Q, EU", "| 4 || 5 ||align=left| Robin Brew ||align=left| || 2:04.52 || "]}, {"page": "Paul Brew", "response": ["His brother Robin Brew is also a former international swimmer."]}, {"page": "British Swimming Championships - 200 metres medley winners", "response": ["|Robin Brew", "|Robin Brew"]}, {"page": "Brew (surname)", "response": ["* Robin Brew (born 1962), British swimmer"]}]}}
