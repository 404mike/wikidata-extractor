He was the lead editor of first three IPCC reports. He was professor in atmospheric physics at the University of Oxford, former Director General at the Met Office and founder of the Hadley Centre.He was the president of the John Ray Initiative, an organisation \"connecting Environment, Science and Christianity\", where he has compared the stewardship of the Earth, to the stewardship of the Garden of Eden by Adam and Eve. He was a founding member of the International Society for Science and Religion. He became the president of the Victoria Institute in 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Houghton", "response": ["John Houghton may refer to:", "* John Houghton (fl.1393), MP for Leicester (UK Parliament constituency)", "* John Houghton (died 1583) (before 1522-1583), MP for Stamford (UK Parliament constituency)", "* John Houghton (Manx politician)", "* John Houghton (Zimbabwean politician)", "* John Houghton (physicist) (1931\u20132020), Welsh atmospheric physicist", "* John Houghton (martyr) (c. 1486\u20131535), English Catholic priest and martyr", "* John Houghton (apothecary) (1645\u20131705), English writer, apothecary and merchant", "* John Houghton (footballer), New Zealand international footballer", "* John Houghton (footballer born 1891), former player of Fulham and Wigan", "* John Houghton (rugby league) (fl. 1970), former St Helens RLFC rugby player"]}, {"page": "Sir John Houghton", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Houghton (physicist)"]}, {"page": "Tearfund", "response": ["Current Tearfund ambassadors include Tamsin Greig and Bear Grylls, along with a number of evangelical Christian leaders including Rev Katei Kirby and Pete Greig.https://www.tearfund.org/en/about_us/whos_who/tearfund_ambassadors/ Other supporters have included Sir John Houghton, Dr Krish Kandiah,  Bishop Harold Miller and Martha Collison.

The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has also stated that \"a 'runaway greenhouse effect'\u2014analogous to [that of] Venus\u2014appears to have virtually no chance of being induced by anthropogenic activities.\"https://archive.ipcc.ch/meetings/session31/inf3.pdf However, climatologist James Hansen disagrees. In his Storms of My Grandchildren he says that burning coal and mining oil sands will result in runaway greenhouse on Earth. A re-evaluation in 2013 of the effect of water vapor in the climate models showed that James Hansen's outcome would require ten times the amount of CO2 we could release from burning all the oil, coal, and natural gas in Earth's crust. As with the uncertainties in calculating the inner edge of the habitable zone, the uncertainty in whether CO2 can drive a moist greenhouse effect is due to differences in modeling choices and the uncertainties therein. The switch from using HITRAN to the more current HITEMP absorption line lists in radiative transfer calculations has shown that previous runaway greenhouse limits were too high, but the necessary amount of carbon dioxide would make an anthropogenic moist greenhouse state unlikely. Full three-dimensional models have shown that the moist greenhouse limit on surface temperature is higher than that found in one-dimensional models and thus would require a higher amount of carbon dioxide to initiate a moist greenhouse than in one-dimensional models. Other complications include whether the atmosphere is saturated or sub-saturated at some humidity, higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere resulting in a less hot Earth than expected due to Rayleigh scattering, and whether cloud feedbacks stabilize or destabilize the climate system."]}, {"page": "John Theodore Houghton", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Houghton (physicist)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*Sir John Houghton, 88, Welsh atmospheric physicist, COVID-19.From the archives: Interview: Sir John Houghton, meteorologist, climate-change expert"]}, {"page": "List of deaths due to COVID-19", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | John Houghton"]}, {"page": "John T.
