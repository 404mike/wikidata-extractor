Among his ensemble pieces, \"Jigsaw\" and \"Notelette\" were requested and performed by Sounds Positive, while \"Zigzag\" was requested and performed (including a broadcast on Radio 3) by Cambridge New Music Players (now known as \"New Music Players\". His \"Piano Trio\" (the first of three works for the medium) was originally requested and performed by London New Music and became his most widely played work, taken up by three other groups and broadcast twice in different performances. Jack's first two string quartets were played and broadcast by The Smith Quartet, and the third, fourth, fifth and sixth recorded by the Arditti Quartet for the Deux-Elles.
