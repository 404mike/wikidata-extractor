The oldest first-time world champion in snooker history, he was the second player, after Ken Doherty, to have won world titles at both amateur and professional levels. His world title took him to a career-high number two in the world rankings, a spot he held until March 2017. He won his second Triple Crown title at the 2020 Masters, defeating Ali Carter 10\u20138 in the final. Aged 43 years and 243 days, he superseded Ray Reardon as the oldest Masters' champion.A prolific break-builder, Bingham has compiled over 500 century breaks during his career.
