Particularly important were the extensively annotated edition by Paul Verni\u00e8re and the research of Robert Shackleton on Muslim chronology; also studies by Roger Laufer, Pauline Kra and Roger Mercier, which put new focus on the work's unity and integrated the seraglio into its overall meaning. Others who have followed have looked into the ramifications of epistolary form, the structure and meaning of the seraglio, Usbek's contradictions. Beginning about 1970 it is religion (Kra) and especially politics (Ehrard, Goulemot, Benrekassa) which predominate in studies on Lettres persanes, with a progressive return to the role of the seraglio with all its women and eunuchs (Delon, Grosrichard, Singerman, Spector) or the cultural cleavage of Orient and Occident."]}, {"page": "List of Brasenose College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Robert Shackleton, English French language philologist and librarian"]}, {"page": "Shackleton (surname)", "response": ["* Robert Shackleton (1919\u20131986), British French-language philologist and librarian"]}, {"page": "Todmorden High School", "response": ["* Robert Shackleton CBE, French language philologist"]}, {"page": "List of honorary graduates of the University of Leeds", "response": ["* Professor Robert Shackleton (DLitt)"]}]}}
