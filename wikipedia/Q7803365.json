His contributions to philosophy include a defence of a non-physicalist account of the mind; a defence of intentionalism about consciousness; a defence of the thesis that perceptual experience has non-conceptual content; a psychologistic approach to the objects of thought; and a defence of the thesis that intentionality is the mark of the mental. He is currently the Head of Department and Professor of Philosophy at Central European University, and was previously the Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Peterhouse. For the academic year 2020\u201321 he was a Visiting Professor at the University of Italian Switzerland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University College, Durham", "response": ["|Tim Crane"]}, {"page": "Intentionality", "response": ["Tim Crane, himself an impure intentionalist, explains this difference by distinguishing three aspects of intentional states: the intentional object, the intentional content, and the intentional mode. For example, seeing that an apple is round and tasting that this apple is sweet both have the same intentional object: the apple. But they involve different contents: the visual perception ascribes the property of roundness to the apple while the gustatory perception ascribes the property of sweetness to the apple. Touching the apple will also result in a perceptual experience ascribing roundness to the apple, but the roundness is presented in a different manner. So the visual perception and the haptic perception agree in both intentional object and intentional content but differ in intentional mode. Pure intentionalists may not agree with this distinction. They may argue, for example, that the difference in the last case also belongs to intentional content, because two different properties are ascribed to the apple: seen-roundness and felt-roundness."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Tim Crane"]}, {"page": "Central European University", "response": ["* Tim Crane, Philosophy"]}, {"page": "Language of thought hypothesis", "response": ["Tim Crane, in his book The Mechanical Mind, states that, while he agrees with Fodor, his reason is very different. A logical objection challenges LOTH\u2019s explanation of how sentences in natural languages get their meaning. That is the view that \u201cSnow is white\u201d is TRUE if and only if P is TRUE in the LOT, where P means the same thing in LOT as \u201cSnow is white\u201d means in the natural language. Any symbol manipulation is in need of some way of deriving what those symbols mean. If the meaning of sentences is explained regarding sentences in the LOT, then the meaning of sentences in LOT must get their meaning from somewhere else. There seems to be an infinite regress of sentences getting their meaning. Sentences in natural languages get their meaning from their users (speakers, writers). Therefore, sentences in mentalese must get their meaning from the way in which they are used by thinkers and so on ad infinitum. This regress is often called the homunculus regress."]}, {"page": "Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy", "response": ["* Tim Crane (2009)"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Tim Crane (Trinity)"]}, {"page": "Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera italiana", "response": ["The faculty includes the Master program in Philosophy whose areas of research are mainly: Metaphysics, Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Mind, Ancient Philosophy and Medieval Philosophy.
