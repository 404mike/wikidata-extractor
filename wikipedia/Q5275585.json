He is the founder of independent record label Earache Records.\nBorn and raised in Nottingham, England, he was introduced to extreme music whilst playing in local bands, one of which being DIY punk band Scum Dribblurzzz, who never released any records or accepted payment for playing shows.\nIn the mid-1980s, he founded Earache, and gradually began releasing records. He says the first year of business, 1986, was spent doing very little. He claims he initially set up the label as a way to continue to claim social security benefits without having to go to the unemployment office every two weeks, saying, \"I didn't fancy doing that\". He started releasing Flexi discs, and then moved on to putting out a split between Concrete Sox and Heresy, and an album by The Acc\u00fcsed. In 1987 he compiled two sessions by different line-ups of the band Napalm Death, and released them as the album Scum. The album proved popular, peaking at No. 7 on the UK Indie Chart and receiving airplay on John Peel's show on BBC Radio 1. Both Napalm Death and Heresy are considered to be pioneering grindcore bands.\nPearson is responsible for signing many pioneering heavy bands including Bolt Thrower, Carcass, Cathedral, Godflesh, Anal Cunt, Entombed, Morbid Angel as well as Deicide, Mortiis, and The Berzerker, as well as releasing more techno-oriented music, and reissues of the label's earlier albums.\nIn 2015, Pearson won the \"Pioneer Award\" from the AIM Independent Music Awards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grindcore", "response": ["Earache Records founder Digby Pearson concurs with Embury, saying that Napalm Death \"put hardcore and metal through an accelerator.\"Blush 1991, page 35 Pearson, however, said that grindcore \"wasn't just about the speed of [the] drums, blast beats, etc.\" He claimed that \"it actually was coined to describe the guitars \u2013 heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [that] 'grind', so that's what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [and] proponents.\"", "Napalm Death's seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups in the 1980s, among them Extreme Noise Terror, Carcass and Sore Throat.Felix von Havoc, Maximum Rock'n'Roll #198.

The band agreed, and in 1989 they released Streetcleaner, which went on to receive critical acclaim and recognition as a landmark album in heavy metal music. Streetcleaner saw the reintroduction of Neville into the band, this time as the second guitarist, and it marked the band's first release of many on Earache. The album further defined Godflesh's sound, standing out from other metal releases with unusual production that emphasised mechanical beats and percussive bass over guitar.

We did it together with Earache! So I'm looking forward to a new powerful and majestic Terrorizer release and for a positive, great and successful relationship with Earache.\"", "Founder and Managing Director of Earache Records Digby Pearson also added: \"\"Terrorizer was one of the first wave of bands I worked with and were true pioneers of grind, back when only a handful of musicians even played extreme metal. The band lasted for too short a time because two members quickly joined other bands (Napalm Death and Morbid Angel) who both began to tour the world and never looked back.

At the request of Digby Pearson, this line-up signed to Earache in June 1994 and recorded Retro-bution, essentially a compilation of re-recorded material from the band's earlier days, which was released in January 1995. The motivation behind this release was due to the band's dissatisfaction with their earlier recordings and saw ENT take a slightly more metal direction, including the addition of some guitar solos. A short UK tour followed, followed by touring in Europe and the US and a further line-up change occurred with Pig Killer being replaced by former Cradle of Filth drummer William A. \"Was\" Sarginson.  (After several years as a professional photographer, in 2013 Pig Killer joined The Featherz under the name Dazzle Monroe.) The line-up changes continued with the departure of founder member Phil Vane, who left to join Napalm Death in late 1996.

Its roster has since diversified into more mainstream guitar music, working with bands such as Rival Sons, the Temperance Movement, Blackberry Smoke, and the White Buffalo.

Accordingly, the first official Earache release on vinyl in 1987 with catalogue number MOSH 1, was The Acc\u00fcsed's The Return of Martha Splatterhead. This was followed by a split LP by the crust/crossover band Concrete Sox and the proto-grind band Heresy. The label's first major release of note was MOSH 3, Napalm Death's Scum. Famously, John Peel was a champion of the band and supported them on BBC Radio 1. The record went on to reach number 7 in the UK indie chart.

They released their debut self-titled EP on the independent label Swordfish later that year. That EP, though described by critics as raw and unrefined, is considered one of the originating industrial metal releases and proved to be the foundation upon which Streetcleaner would fine-tune Godflesh's approach to the genre. After the underground success of Godflesh, the band played several shows across Europe and recorded a four-track EP titled Tiny Tears. Before they could release the EP on Swordfish, Godflesh were acquired by Earache Records, and Digby Pearson, the label's head, urged the band to shelve the tracks and instead focus on putting out a complete studio album next. Broadrick and Green agreed and began recording Streetcleaner in May 1989 at Soundcheck in Birmingham and Square Dance in Derby.", "The four Tiny Tears bonus songs (the title track, \"Wound\", \"Dead Head\" and \"Suction\") are Streetcleaner shortest pieces. Because they were recorded apart from the album, they are compositionally different, more focused on propulsive hard rock riffs and beats than the stark, industrial sterility of Streetcleaner proper. Broadrick employs clean singing rather than growls, and multiple critics have described the tone of the songs as \"ethereal\". Noel Gardner of The Quietus called the EP a \"muscular, enveloping follow-up, and utterly worth hearing\". \"Dead Head\", a frantic song with stretched vocals, even has a tone that Sputnikmusic characterised as almost optimistic. Digby Pearson considered \"Tiny Tears\" one of his favorite Godflesh songs, and \"Wound\" would be revisited by Godflesh multiple times on future releases. One such future release, Earache's 1990 reissue of the band's debut EP Godflesh, featured two songs entitled \"Wounds\" and \"Streetcleaner 2\". Both are extended songs that have been manipulated and altered, something common for Godflesh. While \"Streetcleaner 2\" primarily builds upon and distorts \"Streetcleaner\", it also features deconstructed segments of \"Pulp\".
