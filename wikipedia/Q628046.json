Sixteen actresses were involved: Jesse Jane, Belladonna, Katsuni, Allie Haze, Kayden Kross, April O'Neil, Francesca L\u00e9, Lisa Ann, Brooklyn Lee, Alexis Texas, Asphyxia Noir, Teagan Presley, Ash Hollywood, Tanya Tate, Lexi Belle and Misty Stone. Aroused accompanied a photography book of the same name. The New York Times compared the film's cinematic style to an advertisement for Victoria's Secret, and wrote it would have been better as a television series similar to a combination of Taxicab Confessions and Red Shoe Diaries. Anderson was inspired to work on Aroused, after previously photographing an adult industry actress for a magazine shoot. She wanted to draw attention to a double standard in society regarding consumption of pornography while simultaneously stigmatizing the actresses that perform in the adult industry.<Ref name=kpcc></ref> She stated her attempt was to humanize and provide dignity to the actresses. Anderson cast the actresses in the film in order to showcase, \"the most successful women in the adult film industry\". Aroused was compared by the Chicago Tribune to the documentary After Porn Ends with a more optimistic feel to it. Screen Daily and BroadwayWorld commented favorably on the vulnerability of the subjects. Film critics compared the documentary's style to Michael Moore, Annie Leibovitz and the film Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry.<Ref name=metropolis></ref> A review of the film in the Los Angeles Times was critical, writing that it was only recommended for fans of Alexis Texas, Katsuni and Misty Stone. The Village Voice found the subject more appropriate for a photography book. The Hollywood Reporter and The Washington Post criticized Aroused for its lack of depth.  The New York Daily News criticized Anderson for self-promotion. In 2015, Anderson was one of the first clients for a new photographers' agency launched by Rihanna called The Dog Ate My Homework."]}, {"page": "List of British pornographic actors", "response": ["| Tanya Tate"]}, {"page": "XBIZ Award", "response": ["* 2013: Tanya Tate"]}, {"page": "MILF pornography", "response": ["| Tanya Tate"]}, {"page": "Rik Offenberger", "response": ["In April, 2010, Offenberger, Phil Latter and Ric Croxton founded First Comics News, a web-based division of Super Hero News, covering comics, gaming, wrestling and related pop-culture topics.
