He is the chair and professor of ophthalmology at University of Nottingham and is the head of the Division of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. Prior, he was associate professor at the Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA when he was invited to chair in Nottingham in April 1994. He earlier did his Graduation in Medicine from Government Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur.Dua is also the co-editor in chief with Arun Singh of the British Journal of Ophthalmology. He was president of EuCornea, the European society of Cornea and Ocular surface disease specialists. He is also president of the EVERf  (European Association for Vision and Eye Research Foundation) and past president of the association itself. He was elected to the chair of Academia Ophthalmologica Internationalis and invited to join as member of the American Ophthalmological Society by thesis. In March 2011 he  was elected president of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, UK commencing  his duties on 25 May 2011. He has over 200 research publications, 20 published letters, and 14 book chapters to his credit.Dua was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to eye healthcare, health education and ophthalmology.

Conventionally in a corneal transplantation, doctors use a whole cornea or parts of the five layers of the cornea to perform correction surgeries. In May 2013, Dr Harminder Dua discovered a sixth layer between the stroma and the descemet membrane which was named after him as the Dua's layer. In the PDEK technique, doctors take the innermost two layers of the cornea, along with the Dua's layer and graft it in the patient's eye.", "Prof Amar Agarwal (India) in 2013, September 4 performed the first innovative PDEK surgery technique in collaboration with Prof Harminder Dua (UK) and showed the significance of the Pre Descemets layer in corneal transplantation.
