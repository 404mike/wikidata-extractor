Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.", "* Writer Troy Kennedy Martin was the creator of the long-running BBC police drama Z-Cars (1962\u20131978).

Following Edge of Darkness, he wrote the screenplays for the films Red Heat (with Walter Hill) (1988) and Bravo Two Zero (1999). He died in September 2009.", "\"I am writing this story about a detective who turns into a tree\" was what writer Troy Kennedy Martin told his colleagues when asked what he was working on during the early 1980s.Kennedy Martin, Introduction. Kennedy Martin had become frustrated that \"at the BBC there was no political dimension to their drama whatsoever\" but had chosen to write a political story anyway, not really believing it would ever get made. The election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister and Ronald Reagan as President of the United States had brought about a major shift in the global political landscape. Kennedy Martin was motivated to write out of concern arising from such issues as the Greenham Common protests, the Falklands War, the Miners' strike and arising out of the escalation of the Cold War the fear that \u201cborn-again Christians and Cold War warriors appeared to be running the United States\".", "Although Kennedy Martin's notion for the serial was influenced by real political events, he had for a long time railed against naturalism in television drama \u2013 most notably in a 1964 article for the theatre magazine Encore, titled \"Nats Go Home. First Statement of a New Drama for Television\", in which he sought \"to free the camera from photographing dialogue, to free the structure from natural time and to exploit the total and absolute objectivity of the television camera\".Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 64 Edge of Darkness producer Michael Wearing has noted that \"there is a mystical dimension to Troy's imagination. His instincts are visual and non-naturalistic\".Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 104. Kennedy Martin, therefore, crafted a serial that on the one hand placed its events squarely within the real, present day world but on the other also placed itself within the realm of the mystical and the mythic.Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 112. Realism and authenticity was provided by the appearances of real life television presenter Sue Cook and Labour MP Michael Meacher. There was also use of contemporary stock footage, such as Robin Day's interview with Margaret Thatcher and references to real persons like Michael Heseltine and places such as Sellafield, alongside the references to fictitious characters and places contained in the plot. The mystical dimension is provided by Emma's ghost while the mythic is provided by Craven himself and by Jedburgh and Grogan. Kennedy Martin, influenced by John Darragh's The Real Camelot (Thames and Hudson, 1981) which examined the pagan origins of the Arthurian legend, saw Craven as a modern-day Green Man who would confront the threats to the Earth on behalf of Gaia. Jedburgh was conceived by Kennedy Martin as a Knight of the Marches, one of the Teutonic Knights who defended the borders of Eastern Europe, opposed to Grogan, who Kennedy Martin saw as a descendant of the Knights Templar who, according to legend, had guarded a special wisdom in the Temple of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. These aspects would reach their apotheosis in the serial's conclusion in which Kennedy Martin envisaged that Craven, having found the plutonium stolen by Jedburgh, would be shot by a sniper and would be transformed into a tree.", "By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put the serial into production and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, \"Compassionate Leave\", depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as \"the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember\".Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 54. The budget was set at \u00a32 million, of which \u00a3400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular to the notion that Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 54 - 55. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that \"it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't be able to make it work for the audience\", a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was \"likely not to come off as an effect\". Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, \"Burden of Proof\", the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 113.", "Edge of Darkness tapped into a cultural zeitgeist of concern about nuclear power and nuclear warfare in the early to mid 1980s. In 1980, current affairs programme Panorama broadcast \"If The Bomb Drops\", a documentary that examined how well prepared Britain was for a nuclear attack; in 1983, The Day After an American TV movie about a nuclear war aired, as well as seeing the release of the feature film WarGames, showing the 'no winner' outcome of nuclear war; in 1984, the BBC broadcast On the Eighth Day, a documentary about the effects of a nuclear winter and Threads, a drama about a nuclear attack on Sheffield while 1985 saw the first screening of Peter Watkins' nuclear war television film The War Game, banned on television since 1965.Kibble-White, Let's All Hide in the Linen Cupboard.  Edge of Darkness also rode on a wave of preoccupation with the secretive nature of the State in both fact (e.g. This Week's \u201cDeath on the Rock\u201d (1988) about the deaths of three Provisional IRA members in Gibraltar and Secret Society (1987) about undisclosed matters of public interest which led to the sacking of BBC Director General Alasdair Milne) and fiction (e.g. the films Defence of the Realm (1985) and The Whistle Blower (1987) and the television serials A Very British Coup (1988) and Traffik (1989)).Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 107.", "Edge of Darkness continues to be well regarded to this day. When it was repeated on BBC2 in 1992, Sean Day-Lewis wrote in The Daily Telegraph, \u201cEdge of Darkness is a masterpiece. It is one of those very rare television creations so rich in form and content that the spectator wishes there was some way of prolonging it indefinitely\".Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 103 - 104. Andrew Lavender, writing in British Television Drama in the 1980s, has said that Edge of Darkness \"captured the spirit of its age but went far beyond the drama of its time. [...] It pushed against expectations attaching to the thriller form, often transcending the limits of the genre\".Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 103. Fred Inglis, in his analysis of the serial in Formations: 20th Century Media Studies, takes it \"as one of the most remarkable works of art made for British television\". According to Lez Cooke, in British Television Drama: A History, \"In a reactionary climate, when the possibilities for the production of 'social issue' drama were limited, Edge of Darkness proved that, by adapting to changed circumstances and adopting a serialised thriller format, it was still possible to produce ambitious and progressive television drama in Britain in the mid-1980s\",Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 148. a view echoed by Sean Cubit in EcoMedia who notes that \"the series neatly echoed the chill that descended on radical politics in the Thatcher years in the United Kingdom\".Cubitt, Edge of Darkness: eco-terrorism and the public sphere, p. 79. The television historian Andrew Pixley has described the series as \"possibly the finest BBC drama ever made\" and \"one of the few television programmes where every element can be said to have worked to complete effect\";Pixley, Into The Shadows, p. 53. John Hartley, in Tele-ology: Studies in Television, called it \"the best police drama series ever made for television\" and said that \"its method of investigative drama can unravel some of the complexities of public life more truthfully than investigative journalism\".Hartley, Tele-ology, p. 202-203", "Troy Kennedy Martin's original script for episode one and the final scripts for episodes two to six of the serial were published by Faber and Faber in 1990; the script book also included an introduction by Kennedy Martin and two appendices \u2013 the first giving background to the story and the main characters and the second giving comments on the script by experts on nuclear power and police procedures.", "* Interview with Troy Kennedy Martin (circa 2004)"]}, {"page": "Michael Wearing", "response": ["The first project he was given there by Head of Series & Serials Jonathan Powell was a Troy Kennedy Martin project entitled Edge of Darkness.
