According to Jack Ogden \u2013 a scholar known for his publications on diamonds and the history of jewels, these records include those of Pliny, Marco Polo, Muhammed al-Idrisi and others from pre-12th century. They mention that India produced diamonds with \"which the gems were engraved\". Beyond these sources, ancient texts of Buddhists, Hindus and Jains \u2013 such as the Arthashastra (2nd century BCE \u2013 4th century CE), the Ratna Pariksha, the Puranas \u2013 mention cities and regions of India that produced diamonds. However, these names are difficult to link to modern geographical names.Jack Ogden (2018), Diamonds: An Early History of the King of Gems, Yale University Press, {[ISBN|9780300215663}}, pp. 236\u2013238, for different regions, see 236\u2013255 Recent studies identify a region south of Kurnool district, the area near Krishna river valley as it approaches the Guntur district, north Telangana, northeastern Madhya Pradesh, eastern Chhattisgarh, western Jharkhand, northwestern Odisha (Kosala) were the important diamond mines and historic diamond operations in India. The famed region among these was historically known as Telingana or Tilling, renamed to Golconda during the Islamic rule period and generally known as Godavari delta.
