Joshua Watson, a layman, was a prominent member of the High Church group; he has been described as \"the greatest lay churchman of his day\" and was to become \"the cornerstone of the [Church Building] Commission\", on which he served for 33\u00a0years. Because of the legal structure of the Church of England, it was \"almost indispensable to obtain an Act of Parliament before a church was rebuilt, or a new one built\u00a0\" and \"to divide a parish an Act was essential\". There was growing pressure for Parliament to meet the problems. Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 there was also a movement to build churches \"as a \"national thank-offering\". In December 1815 Joshua Watson and the pamphleteer John Bowdler, wrote a \"memorial\" to the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, arguing the case for more churches. There was initial reluctance from the politicians to agree to the proposal, partly because of the financial deficit following the Napoleonic Wars. In 1817 a committee was appointed to form a society for \"promoting public worship by obtaining additional church-room for the middle and lower classes\". This was successful and at a public meeting on 6\u00a0February 1818 in the Freemasons' Hall, London, chaired by Charles Manners-Sutton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Duke of Northumberland proposed a motion to form the Church Building Society, and this was accepted. This led to Parliament's agreement to provide the First Parliamentary Grant of \u00a31\u00a0million for building new churches.
