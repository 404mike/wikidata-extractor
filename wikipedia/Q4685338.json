He resides in Kemp's facility following Annie moving there and shares a room with her, apparently befriending by her. When Kemp tries to forcibly exorcise Annie, Hennessey stands up for her and points out the lack of the Door, causing Kemp to kill him for one. After seeing his own dead body on the floor and Annie for the first time, his Door appears and they are both forcefully dragged in. Hennessey displayed far greater control over his ability than other psychics.
