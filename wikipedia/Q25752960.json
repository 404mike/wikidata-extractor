He was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1934 and became the chief architect for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway company. He drew up plans with Percy Thomas for the rebuilding of Euston railway station in 1936, but the outbreak of the Second World War resulted in their cancellation\nHe designed a series of pre-fabricated railway stations which were built on blitz-damaged station sites from 1945 onwards. A prototype was erected at Queen\u2019s Park railway station and the first installation was destined for Bootle New Strand railway station.\nHe retired in 1949 and died in 1968.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "South Kenton station", "response": ["The station opened on 3 July 1933 with access from both sides of the railway via a footbridge to the single island platform serving only the Euston-Watford DC line; this footbridge (which started at the bottom of the embankment) was later replaced by a pedestrian tunnel, cutting out a long climb for passengers entering the station.
