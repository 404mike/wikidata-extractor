When he arrived at Tonbridge School he was placed immediately in the First XI even though he was only 13, and became the youngest cricketer to play at Lord's. He was a fine strokemaker who possessed a full array of stokes around the wicket \"a masterly batsman with an excellent technique he... delighted crowds throughout the world with his style and elegance\". His favourite stroke was the most pleasing \u2013 the cover drive, his son Chris Cowdrey was always asked \"Why don't you caress the ball through extra cover like your father?\" and replied \"If I could, I would\".Chris Cowdrey, p. 9 Cowdrey also liked to experiment with new grips and unconventional strokes, to the annoyance of purists who thought his technique was already near perfect and Cowdrey himself noted that \"I have not been a good player when the going is easy... unless the match provided a problem to solve, a theory to test, a hurdle to leap, a challenge worthy of battle, I have never been fully plugged in\".Cowdrey, pp. 33\u201334", "At the start of his career the England batting was fragile and Cowdrey never forgot that his wicket was too important to throw away, sometimes treating bowlers too cautiously for a man of his great talents, John Arlott commenting \"Cowdrey could sink into pits of uncertainty when the fire ceased to burn, allowing himself to be dominated by bowlers inferior to him in skill\".Arlott, p. 57 Cowdrey himself thought that \"the proudest thing in my career was that I kept surviving\",Willis, p. 98 playing Lindwall and Miller at 21 and Lillee and Thomson at 41, still able to move immaculately into line even though he hadn't played for months. His quick reflexes also made him an outstanding slip, whose 120 catches was a Test record for a fielder. In his youth, Cowdrey was a useful leg-spinner at club level, but only took 63 first-class wickets at a cost of 51.21 apiece. He claimed if Alan Knott hadn't misread a googly he would have picked up a Test wicket, though his son Chris wrote \"I can't see Knotty losing sleep over that one\".Chris Cowdrey, p. 60 In Cowdrey's last Test at Melbourne the fans famously hung out a banner 'M.C.G. FANS THANK COLIN \u2013 6 TOURS', with Cowdrey \"wearing a large straw sun-hat ... signing endless autographs, posing for photographs and exchanging friendly talk with young and old in the way that has made him as popular a cricketer as has ever visited Australia\".", "**When Chris Cowdrey bowled Kapil Dev with his fourth ball in Test cricket Colin Cowdrey was listening on the car radio and drove the wrong way down a one-way street, but a policeman let him off with a warning.Chris Cowdrey, p. 50"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Chris Cowdrey \u2013 talkSport 1999\u20132008"]}, {"page": "Graham Gooch", "response": ["Upon the expiration of the ban, Gooch was restored to the England team in 1985.

He returned to the England team for the Cricket World Cup in India and Pakistan, and the subsequent winter tour of Pakistan. His career blossomed later after being appointed captain, a position he held twice: first briefly, at the end of the \"summer of four captains\" in 1988, as a replacement for the injured Chris Cowdrey (who never played another Test). In his first match (the fifth and last of the series against the West Indies), England at least showed some spirit, taking a first-innings lead for the only time in the series. Gooch's second-innings 84 stood alone as the rest of the batting collapsed, England losing the match (and with it the series 4\u20130). His second match, the one-off Test against Sri Lanka, was won, and all seemed fair for Gooch to remain as captain for the tour of India that winter. But that tour was cancelled over the Indian government's refusal to grant visas to the eight players who had sporting links with South Africa, including Gooch himself. David Gower returned as captain for the losing 1989 Ashes series \u2013 in which, for a second time, Gooch's loss of form with the bat resulted in his being dropped, by his own request this time."]}, {"page": "Talksport", "response": ["The new line-up involved a number of presenters and commentators, including Alan Brazil, Mark Nicholas, Chris Cowdrey, Geoffrey Boycott, Mike Parry, Peter Shilton, Brian Moore, Brough Scott, Tom Watt, Gary Newbon, Ian Darke, Tony Banks, and Alvin Martin."]}, {"page": "Tonbridge School", "response": ["Tonbridge alumni who have gone on to represent the England cricket team include Kenneth Hutchings, Colin Cowdrey, Roger Prideaux, Chris Cowdrey, Richard Ellison, Ed Smith and Zak Crawley.Tonbridge cricket history, Tonbridge School.

However, the side was extensively remodelled for the first Test of that summer's Ashes series. Of the bowlers who had played the last Test in India, only Cowans had survived the cull and it set the tone for the series.

After losing the second Test, and struggling with the ball in the third Test, when Australia made 539 all out in their only innings, England decided to make further changes."]}]}}
