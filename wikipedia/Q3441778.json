The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth, who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, \"My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'.\" Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth bandmate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. \"They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash\". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, \"It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals\". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for."]}, {"page": "Dance into the Light", "response": ["The album features more musicians as opposed to Both Sides, which saw Collins as the sole performer.

They would play their hit \"Concrete and Clay\" sometimes three times a night up and down the country (1966\u20131967). He later said it was quite a musical education for the age of 16. In 1969, Heyman and Caryl formed the school band Sanctuary; the band's concerts often featured a friend from a rival stage school, Barbara Speake Stage School, the soon to be star Phil Collins. In a two-drummer setup, Heyman and Collins played the same fills, which became somewhat of a norm later in Genesis's career with Chester Thompson. The two were to work again later when Collins asked Heyman to work with his band Brand X as percussionist.  Leaving school on the brink of his GCSE exams explaining to his parents that he would not need them in a music career, Heyman secured an album deal for Sanctuary with Polydor, recording an album at Rockfield Studios that still remains unreleased."]}, {"page": "Ark 2 (album)", "response": ["* Ronnie Caryl \u2013 vocals, bass guitar, 12-string guitar", "* Ronnie Caryl Official Biography"]}, {"page": "Flaming Youth (band)", "response": ["In 1969, American singer John Walker, of the Walker Brothers, toured in England, and was accompanied by keyboardist Brian Chatton, bassist Gordon \"Flash\" Smith, guitarist Ronnie Caryl and drummer Phil Collins.
