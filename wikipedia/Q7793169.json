He served in the Second World War as a night fighter squadron commander and then as a station commander. He was Chief of the Air Staff in the early 1960s and, in that role, deployed British air power as part of the British response to the Brunei Revolt. Also, in the face of escalating costs, he implemented the cancellation of the British Blue Streak ballistic missile system but then found the RAF was without any such capability when the Americans cancelled their own Skybolt ballistic missile system. He went on to be Deputy Supreme Commander Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in the mid-1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RAF Fighter Command", "response": ["| 8 August 1956 || 30 July 1959 ||  MRAF Sir Thomas Pike"]}, {"page": "Marshal of the Royal Air Force", "response": ["|6 April 1962||100px||Sir Thomas Pike||1906||1983||Chief of the Air Staff 1960\u20131963"]}, {"page": "Marshal of the air force", "response": ["|United Kingdom||1962|| ||Sir Thomas Pike||Marshal of the Royal Air Force||1906||1983||Promoted 6 April 1962."]}, {"page": "No. 41 Squadron RAF", "response": ["41 Squadron's standard, originally presented only six months previously, was handed over to 141 Squadron on 16 January 1958 in a short ceremony attended by Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir Thomas Pike, and by 11 Group's Air Officer Commanding, Air Vice-Marshal Victor Bowling, himself a veteran 41 Squadron pilot from 1935."]}, {"page": "Supreme Allied Commander Europe", "response": ["|4. || Marshal of the RAF Sir Thomas Pike || 60px || January 1, 1964 || March 1, 1967||  Royal Air Force "]}, {"page": "Hawker Siddeley P.1154", "response": ["While financial backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support development of the Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding.

HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly more value than their subsonic counterparts.Wood 1975, p. 214."]}, {"page": "1983 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 1 June \u2013 Sir Thomas Pike, Royal Air Force Commander (born 1906)"]}, {"page": "Michael Quinlan (civil servant)", "response": ["In 1954, Quinlan joined the Air Ministry as a civil servant.
