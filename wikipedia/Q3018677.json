In 2012, however, Rennie noted that Open Europe had by then fallen in with the Europhile consensus saying \"the hostility of earlier reports\" was \"muted\" under Open Europe's then director, Mats Persson, and that the group had \"worked to shake off an early reputation as a partisan campaign group, which concentrated exclusively on negative aspects of the European project\". He credited the group for eschewing \"the nationalism of many eurosceptic groups\" and defending the concept of freedom of movement, but added that the organisation \"remains as much a campaign group as think tank.\""]}]}}
