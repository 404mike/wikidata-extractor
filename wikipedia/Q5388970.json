The Bainbridges had a daughter called Lesley who is a spoiled daddy's girl, and became Jacko's girlfriend during series one. She was played by two actresses during the life of the show: Kim Thomson in the first series and Erika Hoffman from series two onwards. In series one it was hinted that Jacko was somehow indebted to Lionel and working for him after the pair had become involved with some unlawful money-making wheeling-dealing some years prior, for which Jacko almost got caught and was set to stand trial until Lionel used his 'respectable business reputation' to fabricate a story and get him off the hook, leaving Jacko 'indebted' and working for him, against his better wishes, as a result. This history between the pair was several times hinted at during the first series, but was never mentioned from series two onwards."]}, {"page": "Machair (TV series)", "response": ["|Erika Hoffman || Charlotte Van Agten || 3.01 -7.06"]}, {"page": "From Prussia with Love", "response": ["| Erika Hoffman"]}, {"page": "Eric Hoffman", "response": ["*Erika Hoffman, British actress"]}, {"page": "Room at the Bottom (1986 TV series)", "response": ["* Erika Hoffman as Nancy"]}]}}
