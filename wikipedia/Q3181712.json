The crowd was estimated at 3,500, the largest for an FA Cup Final up to that point.Warsop, pp.\u00a040\u201345 The match was played in a strong wind, to the extent that when Frederick Maddison took a corner kick for Wanderers, the gale blew the ball back out of play. The Wanderers dominated the early stages of the game, but the Etonians kept them at bay for around 35 minutes until Charles Wollaston eluded Thompson and passed the ball to John Hawley Edwards, who kicked it narrowly under the crossbar of the Etonians' goal to give Wanderers the lead.Warsop, p.\u00a033 In the second half the Old Etonians had the wind in their favour and had the better of the play.  Around five minutes after the interval, a corner kick to the Etonians led to a \"scrimmage\" (a term in common use at the time to describe a group of players struggling to gain possession of the ball) in front of their opponents' goal, which resulted in the ball and a number of players being forced over the goal-line, uprooting the goalposts in the process.  Modern sources credit the goal to Alexander Bonsor, but contemporary newspaper reports in The Sporting Life and Bell's Life in London do not mention his name, merely noting that the goal was scored \"from a scrimmage\".
