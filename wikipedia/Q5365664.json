He scored again on 17 July with a penalty against Sudbury, before scoring in his fourth consecutive match with four goals in an 8\u20131 win over Leiston on 19 July. He scored his first goal of the campaign in League One during a 2\u20131 defeat to Notts County at Meadow Lane on 19 August. He scored his second goal of the season in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Peterborough United on 30 August, reducing the U's deficit at 2\u20131, and then secured his third goal of the season on 13 September when Colchester defeated Leyton Orient 2\u20130 at Brisbane Road. He continued his good scoring form when he tapped home a spilled save from Sheffield United goalkeeper Mark Howard in an eventual 3\u20132 defeat to the Blades on 16 September. His fifth goal of the season began proceedings in a 3\u20130 win away to Crewe Alexandra on 27 September when he converted a Sanchez Watt cross from six yards. In the Football League Trophy, Sears scored his sixth goal of the season with a late equaliser in a 3\u20133 draw with Gillingham on 8 October, slotting home Elliott Hewitt's low cross. He scored the equaliser from the edge of the box in a 1\u20131 draw with Scunthorpe United at Glanford Park on 18 October, before scoring his eighth of the season with an 87th-minute winner at the Community Stadium against Chesterfield on 21 October. He earned a consolation goal for his side in their 2\u20131 home reverse by Port Vale on 1 November, but took his goal tally into double figures for the season in the next match on 9 November when Colchester faced Gosport Borough in the FA Cup first round. Having already provided an assist for Sanchez Watt and with Colchester 2\u20130 up, Sears converted a penalty kick after he was brought down in the area. He scored again in the 78th minute to restore a three-goal cushion for his side, tapping home into an empty net in a match that eventually ended 6\u20133. He scored his fourth goal in three games in the U's 3\u20132 away defeat to Barnsley on 14 November. After not scoring for all of December as Colchester fell into the relegation positions, Sears' 13th goal of the campaign finally arrived as a consolation in the U's 3\u20131 FA Cup defeat to Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium on 2 January 2015 following a neat passing move.
