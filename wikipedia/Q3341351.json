(two spells), and Liverpool St Helens F.C. as a Wing, and club level rugby league (RL) for Oldham (Heritage \u2116 1004), at the time of his move to Oldham, he was employed by Merseyside Police. There were also rumours of Nigel being employed as a waiter in the notorious hooters bar in the US shortly after retirement, although this has never been confirmed his wife was seen leaving the premises and upon interview told reporters she was \u2033extremely proud of Nige and will support him anywhere his heart takes him\u2033.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 4", "response": ["*  1963   \u2013 Nigel Heslop, English rugby player"]}, {"page": "Rory Underwood", "response": ["Underwood was capable of playing on either right or left wing depending on who was selected on the opposite side. More usually seen on the left wearing shirt number 11, in 1988 he switched to the right (and shirt number 14) to accommodate Chris Oti: in 1990 on the right opposite Mark Bailey, but on the left when partnering Simon Halliday, continuing on the left in 1991 opposite Nigel Heslop: in the 1991 World Cup he played on the right in partnership with Oti early on, then on the left in partnership with Heslop until the quarter-final and Halliday for the final two rounds, an arrangement that persisted throughout the 1992 Five Nations championship \u2013 which was initially billed as his final season before retirement, Underwood scoring tries in each of the first three matches of the championship, and coming close to scoring against Wales. However, Underwood changed his mind and opted to carry on, initially for the next match against South Africa (their first match since their readmission to international sport), and eventually for several more years \u2013 playing mostly now on the left, to accommodate his younger brother, Tony, on the right wing.  They were the first brothers to represent England at the same time since 1937: and, in the 1993 match against Scotland, the first pair of brothers to score tries in the same match for England.

Still refusing to mortgage their assets in an attempt to keep up with more wealthy competitors they decided to cut their cloth accordingly. The whole squad moved to part-time, Director of Coaching Ged Glynn departed to be replaced by 'Sammy' Southern, who returned as Chairman of Rugby, and a coaching panel came in under former club captain Bill Lyon, assisted by Phil Moss and former British Lions and England wing Mike Slemen. The situation was explained to the players and this resulted in a further exodus with Ben Cronin and Brian Walsh returning to Ireland, Zimbabwean international Doug Trivella moving to Rotherham, Charlie Harrison signing for Bedford and Nigel Heslop choosing junior rugby with local side West Park. However, Ian Wynn and Paul Manley returned from the 'White Rose' county and other players were recruited, including David Slemen son of the former British Lion together with a number of others out of the local junior ranks.", "The 'ethos' of the Anvils was one of enjoyment of rugby, both on and off the field. Competition for places in the side was strong, with a squad of over 30 players, yet team spirit remained high. Players with extensive first team experience such as Jeff Huxley, Nigel Heslop, Steve Taberner, Micky Glynn and Dick Fisher played alongside promising young players like Paul Engwell, Andy Carroll, David Honor, Mike Caldwell and Ricky Rimmer. The Anvils became the perfect vehicle for senior players, who had perhaps had enough of the pressures and demands of 1st XV rugby but who still wanted to enjoy playing the game, to pass on their experience to younger lads hoping to progress to play at a more senior level. From that point of view the Anvils became an integral part of the Orrell set up and saw players go on to play 2nd and 1st team rugby.", "*  Nigel Heslop, England"]}, {"page": "List of players who have converted from one football code to another", "response": ["| Nigel Heslop || England || International || Rugby Football League Championship || England  ||  1990s"]}, {"page": "Chris Oti", "response": ["However, later in 1991 he was surprisingly picked ahead of Nigel Heslop \u2013 the incumbent winger for the 1991 Five Nations and Grand Slam \u2013 for the opening World Cup match against New Zealand, and kept his place for the following game against Italy. This turned out to be his last international appearance as further injuries curtailed his career: England were forced to finish the World Cup with the same makeshift back line that they had previously finished the 1990 Five Nations championship, with Halliday (nominally a centre) on the wing, thanks to both Oti and Heslop \u2013 who took over from Oti in the group stages and quarter-final \u2013 being judged unfit to start the match."]}, {"page": "St. Helens RUFC", "response": ["A number of the team achieved international honours; Alan 'Ned' Ashcroft, John Horton, Nigel Heslop and the current club President Ray French who gained International honours in both League and Union.

He went on to play for Bath Rugby Club. His sporting career was interrupted by a serious leg injury when playing for Somerset against Middlesex in the Rugby Union County Championship in 1983. He recovered to work his way into the England national team and made his debut in the 1986 Five Nations. He soon formed what seemed initially to be a stable and lasting centre partnership with Will Carling, only to be dropped to the bench during 1989-90 thanks to the emergence of Jeremy Guscott as Carling's centre partner (since Carling, as captain, was guaranteed his own place in the side).  England's selectors nevertheless attempted to fit Halliday into the side by playing him on the wing with Carling and Guscott at centre, but in the 1990 Five Nations campaign this move met with only mixed success in two matches - the victory over Wales followed by a defeat in the Grand Slam decider, against Scotland.  He did not play in the 1991 Five Nations, but was however a part of England's 1991 Rugby World Cup campaign, initially in the squad as a utility-back squad member, playing a group match against USA: then playing in the Semi Final win over Scotland, and the Final which they lost to Australia.  In these two matches he was once again played on the right wing, selected ahead of the actual specialist winger Nigel Heslop: the latter believed to be still somewhat fragile after taking a pounding in the brutal quarter-final against France, and the other winger in the squad (Chris Oti) being injury-prone. The move was regarded as enough of a success for Halliday to be retained on the wing as first choice for the next year, in the England side which won the 1992 Five Nations Championship with a Grand Slam. He played in 23 internationals from 1986 to 1992, retiring after the 1992 grand slam: his two international tries came in the 1988 autumn victory over Australia (partnering Carling at centre, in the latter's first match as captain) and the 1992 Five Nations victory over Ireland (playing on the wing)."]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1137||Nigel Heslop||wing ||1990-07-28||v Argentina at Buenos Aires"]}, {"page": "1991 Rugby World Cup Final", "response": ["England had reached the final by playing an attritional, forward dominated game, but appeared to respond to heavy public criticism from David Campese and rejected this style of play in the final. Jason Leonard later said in his autobiography that the decision to change the tactics was made by Roger Uttley, Geoff Cooke, Will Carling and Rob Andrew. Leonard also said that most of the forwards were unhappy with the decision and they said to the coaches and Carling that they needed to go back to the huge, forward-dominated game that had helped them win four matches since their opening round loss to New Zealand. They chose to play a more expansive and open game, but failed to master it in the short time they had to practice it. The change in play was an attempt to unsettle the Australians, however, this proved flawed. There were also arguments over the composition of England's back row and back line, following selectoral decisions taken at the semi-final stage which resulted in two men playing out of position. Simon Halliday, nominally a centre, playing on the wing instead of the somewhat fragile Nigel Heslop (who had taken a serious pounding in the quarter-final against France) and the injury-prone Chris Oti, was a selection of necessity which worked well enough to be retained as England's first choice selection for a year afterwards: but the dropping of the No. 8 specialist Dean Richards in order to accommodate both of the two in-form blind-side flankers Mike Teague (who played out of position at #8) and Mick Skinner, who had previously been competing for one position at #6, raised considerable critical comment. Even though Richards had been exposed as badly short of form and fitness during England's summer tour of Australia, and was viewed by the English press as the most culpable in their defeats, he was the specialist in the position, an integral part of England's 1991 Grand Slam, and was back to his best by the autumn: however, Teague had also been Player of the Series for the British Lions on their successful tour of Australia in 1989, albeit playing at #6 with Richards at #8: and Skinner was the man in the best current form of all of them, arguably ahead of Teague for the blind-side flanker position. So the choice of three men in two positions was never going to be an easy one, and the selectors went with the man who had shown the best previous form against the opponents they were facing."]}, {"page": "Dangerous play in rugby union", "response": ["After French fullback Serge Blanco was bumped after taking a mark by Englishman Nigel Heslop during the 1991 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, flanker \u00c9ric Champ knocked Heslop out with a punch.

He received a red card and subsequent seven week ban for the offence, although as it occurred during the Australian off-season he didn't miss any games. In 2009 at a rugby derby involving two of Romania's top teams a mass brawl broke out involving most of the players and reportedly a few spectators. Two players received a red card at the time and nine players were later suspended by the Romanian Rugby Federation."]}]}}
