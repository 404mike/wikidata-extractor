Journalist Wolfe Kaufman claimed that he coined the word \"whodunit\" around 1935 while working for Variety magazine. However, an editor of the magazine, Abel Green, attributed it to his predecessor, Sime Silverman. The earliest appearance of the word \"whodunit\" in Variety occurs in the edition of August 28, 1934, in reference to a film adaptation of the play Recipe for Murder, as featured in the headline, \"U's Whodunit: Universal is shooting 'Recipe for Murder,' Arnold Ridley's play\".

Mrs Christie's Three Act Tragedy is up to her best level\"; he summarised the set-up of the plot but then added, \"A weak (but perhaps inevitable point) is the disappearance of a butler; the reader, that is to say, is given rather too broad a hint.

The fault which I find is the overimportance of luck. For the villains it was, for example, singular good luck which enabled them to discover and identify an obscure vicar's fourth son asleep on a solitary picnic; it was very bad luck for them that he was able to assimilate a sixteenth times fatal dose of morphia. They were lucky, again, in having always at hand just the properties required to make an extempore murder seem something else; and as for the Bright Young Couple \u2013 but these are defects which are little noticeable in the gay stream of Mrs Christie's narrative.
