Described as \"the father of London's modern archaeology\", Merrifield was a specialist in the archaeology of both Roman London and magical practices, publishing six books on these subjects over the course of his life.\nBorn in Temple Fortune, London, Merrifield grew up in Brighton, Sussex. He began his archaeological career in 1930 as an assistant to the curator of Brighton Museum, H. S. Toms. In 1935 he gained an external degree in anthropology from the University of London.\nDuring the Second World War he served in the Royal Air Force, and in 1950 he became assistant keeper of the Guildhall Museum in London. In 1956 he relocated to Accra to organise the opening of the new National Museum of Ghana, before returning to work at the Guildhall Museum the following year. While working there, he produced a synthesis of known material on the archaeology of Roman London, published as The Roman City of London in 1965.\nIn 1975 the Guildhall Museum was amalgamated with the London Museum to create the new Museum of London. Merrifield was appointed senior keeper, and soon after was promoted to deputy director. He retired in 1978 but remained active within the archaeological community, travelling the country to give public lectures, and publishing The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, in 1987, and further studies of Roman London. He was a keen supporter of the Standing Conference on London Archaeology, a body designed to monitor the impact that English Heritage was having on the city's archaeology, which he believed to be negative.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Murray", "response": ["On researching the history of UCL's Egyptology department, the historian Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was \"remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt.\" Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a \"diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age\". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings \"she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, and then in the middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument\". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society \"remember her fondly\", adding that Murray had been \"especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas\"."]}, {"page": "Magic and religion", "response": ["Ralph Merrifield, the British archaeologist credited as producing the first full-length volume dedicated to a material approach to magic,Houlbrook, C. and Armitage, N.

Morrison also produced a more objective study of the cunning man, published in The Strand magazine. During the 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple conducted further research on Murrell, finding much local folklore still surrounding him in the Hadleigh area, including the allegation that he had the ability to fly and to instantaneously transport himself vast distances. Murrell has continued to attract the attention of historians and folklorists studying English folk magic, and is referenced in works by scholars like Ronald Hutton, Owen Davies, and Ralph Merrifield.", "An alternate story spread that Murrell had been killed by a witch-bottle that had been placed into a fire by an aggrieved local man who believed that Murrell had bewitched his donkey and thus caused its death. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield concluded that this tale was \"probably entirely apocryphal\". Another story given by Choppen was that Murrell's son Edward \u2013 or \"Buck\" as he was nicknamed \u2013 had taken the cunning man's final witch-bottle.
