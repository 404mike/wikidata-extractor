Described as \"the father of London's modern archaeology\", Merrifield was a specialist in the archaeology of both Roman London and magical practices, publishing six books on these subjects over the course of his life.\nBorn in Temple Fortune, London, Merrifield grew up in Brighton, Sussex. He began his archaeological career in 1930 as an assistant to the curator of Brighton Museum, H. S. Toms. In 1935 he gained an external degree in anthropology from the University of London.\nDuring the Second World War he served in the Royal Air Force, and in 1950 he became assistant keeper of the Guildhall Museum in London. In 1956 he relocated to Accra to organise the opening of the new National Museum of Ghana, before returning to work at the Guildhall Museum the following year. While working there, he produced a synthesis of known material on the archaeology of Roman London, published as The Roman City of London in 1965.\nIn 1975 the Guildhall Museum was amalgamated with the London Museum to create the new Museum of London. Merrifield was appointed senior keeper, and soon after was promoted to deputy director. He retired in 1978 but remained active within the archaeological community, travelling the country to give public lectures, and publishing The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic, in 1987, and further studies of Roman London. He was a keen supporter of the Standing Conference on London Archaeology, a body designed to monitor the impact that English Heritage was having on the city's archaeology, which he believed to be negative.", "link_mentions": {}}}
