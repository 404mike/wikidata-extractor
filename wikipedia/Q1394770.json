This is the original medieval part of the village, sited next to the Caundle Brook in the north of the parish. Secondary settlements were established later to the south, east and west; these were outside The Borough's open field system and had their own enclosures. The most southerly part of the parish was enclosed in 1797. The church, dedicated to St Lawrence, largely dates from the late 15th century, though it was restored in 1885. The biblical scholar Henry Adeney Redpath was rector at Holwell between 1883 and 1890."]}, {"page": "Pronunciation respelling for English", "response": ["|+ Henry Adeney Redpath's table of signs in the King James Bible"]}, {"page": "Bible concordance", "response": ["The first was that of Conrad Kircher (Frankfort, 1607); Tromm's, published at Amsterdam, 1718, had reference not only to the Septuagint, but also to the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. It remained the standard until it gave way to Edwin Hatch and Henry Adeney Redpath's \"Concordance to the Septuagint and other Greek Versions of the Old Testament\" (Oxford, 1892\u201397). This includes a concordance to the deutero-canonical books and the Old Testament Apocrypha, and to the remains of the versions which form part of Origen of Alexandria's Hexapla. The Hebrew equivalents of the Greek, when known, are also given. References to proper names are added in a supplement published in 1900. Bagster's \"Handy Concordance to the Septuagint\" (London, 1887) gives simply the references, without quotations."]}, {"page": "Edward William Grinfield", "response": ["*1901\u20131905 Henry Adeney Redpath"]}]}}
