However, it is not of great commercial importance. As it also occurs in Veracruz, it was long confused with I. purga, even by such eminent botanists as David Don, Thomas Nuttall or C.J.W. Schiede. Consequently, the name I. jalapa is often seen as an invalid junior homonym referring to I. purga, in particular in sources older than 1989 (when the confusion was finally resolved). Throughout much of the 20th century, the I. jalapa of Linnaeus was called I. carrizalia."]}, {"page": "D.Don", "response": ["#redirect David Don"]}, {"page": "Ceratopetalum apetalum", "response": ["Ceratopetalum apetalum was first formally described in 1830 by David Don in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, from specimens collected by George Caley."]}, {"page": "George Don", "response": ["George Don was born at Doo Hillock, Forfar, Angus, Scotland on 29 April 1798 to Caroline Clementina Stuart and George Don, principal gardener of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1802.

The subsequently submerged subfamily bears the authority of Alphonse de Candolle (A.DC.) for his formal conspectus of Theophrastaceae in 1844. The authority for the tribe Theophrasteae is that of Bartling who used the term Theophrastea to describe a grouping of genera, including Theophrasta within the family Ardisiaceae in 1830. This represents the earliest creation of a suprageneric taxon for these genera. The Ardisiaceae were later included in the other primuloid family, Myrsinaceae (Myrsinoideae)."]}, {"page": "Melastoma affine", "response": ["Melastoma affine was first described by Scottish botanist David Don in 1823.

In 2001 Karsten Meyer proposed a revision in which this species and other species were subsumed within the species Melastoma malabathricum."]}]}}
