In defense of the film's portrait of warfare, Brian De Palma commented, \"The level of violence in something like Saving Private Ryan makes sense because Spielberg is trying to show something about the brutality of what happened.\" Actor Richard Todd, who performed in The Longest Day and was among the first Allied soldiers to land in Normandy (Operation Tonga), said the film was \"Rubbish. Overdone.\" American academic Paul Fussell, who saw combat in France during World War II, objected to what he described as, \"the way Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, after an honest, harrowing, 15-minute opening visualizing details of the unbearable bloody mess at Omaha Beach, degenerated into a harmless, uncritical patriotic performance apparently designed to thrill 12-year-old boys during the summer bad-film season.
