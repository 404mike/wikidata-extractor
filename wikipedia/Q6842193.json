When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her \"the favourite of the hour\".Gillies, p. 58\"Miss Marie Lloyd at the Oxford\", The Era, 12 September 1891, p. 3 During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris.Gillies, p. 60 The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood.Pope, p. 87 The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade.Gillies, p. 74 During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when she got out of bed to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot.\"1892: Hop O' My Thumb\" Its-behind-you.com, accessed 2 February 2013Farson, pp. 45\u201346 The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her not to do it again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said \"Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? I think of little besides her.\"Letters to Reggie as quoted in Gillies, p. 76 On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station.The Times, 1 April 1892, p. 2Anthony, p. 115 In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, \"ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress\".Pope, pp. 114\u2013115", "In January 1915, Lloyd appeared at the Crystal Palace where she entertained over ten thousand troops. At the end of that year, she performed her only war song, \"Now You've Got your Khaki On\", composed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a woman who found the army uniform sexy and thought that wearing it made the average pot-bellied gentleman look like a muscle-toned soldier. Lloyd's brother John appeared with her on stage dressed as a soldier and helped characterise the ditty. Following this, she sang the already well-established songs \"If You Want to Get On in Revue\", which depicted a young girl who offered sexual favours to promote her theatrical career, and \"The Three Ages of Woman\", which took a cynical look at men from a woman's perspective.Gillies, p. 252 She seldom toured during the war, but briefly performed in Northampton, Watford and Nottingham in 1916. By the end of that year, she had suffered a nervous breakdown which she blamed on her hectic workload and a delayed reaction to Hurley's death.Gillies, pp. 254\u2013255 During the war years, Lloyd's public image had deteriorated. Her biographer Midge Gillies thought that Lloyd's violent relationship with Dillon and professional snubs in public had left the singer feeling like \"someone's mother, rather than their sweetheart.\"", "In July 1919, Lloyd was again left off the cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies compared Lloyd to a \"talented old aunt who must be allowed to have her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz or go to the Picture Palace\".Gillies, p. 265 She toured Cardiff in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning \u00a311,000 a year. Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness.Gillies, p. 81 Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of writs from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family,Farson, pp. 116\u2013117 resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life."]}, {"page": "Cantab (magazine)", "response": ["* Midge Gillies.
