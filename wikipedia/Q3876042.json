There were screenings of extended rough cuts of \"A Quarter to Midnight\" and \"There Are Crocodiles\", along with auctions of wardrobe and props.

The name \"Talwinning\" appears as the name of streets in \"A Quarter to Midnight\" and Joking Apart, and as the surname of the protagonist in \"Dying Live\", an episode of Murder Most Horrid written by Moffat, as well as the name of a librarian in his Doctor Who prose short story, \"Continuity Errors\", which was published in the 1996 Virgin Books anthology Decalog 3: Consequences. The name \"Inspector Hibbert\", from \"The Last Word\", is given to the character played by Nick Stringer in \"Elvis, Jesus and Jack\", Moffat's final Murder Most Horrid contribution.
