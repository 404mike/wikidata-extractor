It is not part of the Anglican Communion.\nThe UECNA describes itself as \"embracing the broad base of ceremonial practice inherent in the Historic Anglican Communion\" although historically the UECNA has tended to be low or broad church in its ceremonial practice. The UECNA uses the 1928 Book of Common Prayer and the 1662 Book of Common Prayer in the US and, in Canada, the 1962 edition of the Canadian Prayer Book and use of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer is also permitted.\nThe changes in The Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada that the UECNA and other continuing churches objected to include the theology of the newer versions of the Book of Common Prayer such as The Episcopal Church's 1979 edition, the ordination of women, attitudes toward divorce and abortion, and differing interpretations of how the authority of scripture is perceived. They also object to more recent innovations such as the ordination of openly homosexual clergy, but these were not at issue when they broke with the Episcopal Church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barton-upon-Humber", "response": ["|Peter D.

The Presiding Bishop acts as Chairman of the House of Bishops and the National Council, and as primus inter pares or 'first among equals'. The Constitution and Canons were modified in 1992 (confirmed in 1996), with the title for the senior bishop reverting to 'Presiding Bishop.'  However, the change of title never really caught on, and the 2011 General Convention of the UECNA codified the common custom of referring to the senior bishop as 'Archbishop' by modifying Canon 3 - Of the Presiding Bishop - to reflect this.  However, the formal title remains 'Presiding Bishop' and is used in formal documents.  The UECNA derives its historic episcopate from the Episcopal Church via Albert A. Chambers and the Anglican Catholic Church, and also from the Philippine Independent Catholic Church through that church's now defunct Anglican Rite Jurisdiction of the Americas.  Unlike the Episcopal Church, the Presiding Bishop of the United Episcopal Church may retain his diocese after election, and does not serve a fixed term, but is expected to resign following the election of a successor at the General Convention prior to the incumbent's 72nd birthday.  In the event of an unexpected vacancy occurring, the senior bishop by date of consecration having jurisdiction serves as Presiding Bishop until an election can take place.

The bishops are elected by the House of Bishops, the clergy and lay members are elected members by the House of Deputies, and the two representatives of UECW by their triennial meeting.  The National Council meets regularly each year, usually in mid-May, and at the end of General Convention when it meets.  The Presiding Bishop has the authority to convene special meetings should circumstances so require.  The canons describe the functions of the National Council as being to coordinate the church's social work, missions, and publicity, but over time it has become a sounding board for the House of Bishops assisting them in their administration of the church between general conventions.  Bishop Peter D. Robinson has suggested that it may be time to redefine the role of the National Council, and rename it the \"Administrative or Executive Council\" and formalize its expanded purpose.", "In ceremonial matters, the present Presiding Bishop, Peter D. Robinson, points outs that the UECNA has a greater diversity of churchmanship and ceremonial practice than it did in the 1980s.  However, the church is very insistent that ceremonial use conform to traditional Anglican or Episcopalian customs.  Historically, the minimum of vestments required for services in parish churches is surplice and tippet (rochet, chimere and tippet for bishops.)  At the other extreme, the 1559 Ornaments Rubric represents the maximum of vesture and ornament contemplated by the compilers of the Book of Common Prayer."]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century religious leaders", "response": ["::*Peter D.
