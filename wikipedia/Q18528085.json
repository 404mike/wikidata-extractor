The school was the largest academic school for girls in Aberdeen and she inspired her students to include a university degree in their ambitions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albyn School", "response": ["The school was founded in 1867 by Harriet Warrack as a private school for upper-middle-class girls. Following her retirement the running of the school was passed on to Alexander Mackie. In 1886 the school moved into premises at Nos 4-6 in a terrace diagonally opposite St Margaret\u2019s School for Girls and was officially known as the Albyn Place School for Girls, but most people knew it as \"Mackie's\", because of the reputation of principal Alexander Mackie. It was also known as the Union Place Ladies' School for a period. In 1967, the school celebrated its centenary. Under the direction of Headmistress Dorothy Kidd, a volume was produced outlining the school's history. For much of its history, Albyn was a boarding school and only recently became a day school."]}, {"page": "Warrack", "response": ["*Grace Harriet Warrack (1855\u20131932), Scottish editor and translator", "*Harriet Warrack (\u20131910), Scottish school founder and headmistress "]}]}}
