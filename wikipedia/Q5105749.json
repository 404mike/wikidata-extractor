Although initially, players were signed either from other clubs, or would go straight into first team reckoning after being signed from their amateur club at a much later age than today's system; as the game became more widespread in the town, across the North\u2014West and nationally, a system had to be introduced in order to suffice the amount of youth talent that the club homed. More early examples of players that made the grade following on form their stints in the academy and reserves (previously known as the \"St Helens Colts\") include Steve Prescott, Paul Forber, Gary Connolly, and Chris Arkwright. St Helens' traditional policy with youth was to make them better players for the club. Now, however, it can be argued that Saints look to make them internationals, with no less than five of the current St Helens squad's youth products having gone on to represent either Great Britain or England or both. St Helens youth policy does not operate solely in the borough boundaries of the town. Indeed, many of St Helens current and past squads call areas like Widnes, Wigan, Cumbria and Oldham home. St Helens have, also, branched even into rugby union territory and other wider national areas for youth players; most recently, Daniel Brotherton, a winger from Northampton, signed a professional contract with the club, and has made great strides in the under 18s after his signing from Northampton Demons."]}, {"page": "Arkwright", "response": ["*Chris Arkwright (born 1959), English professional rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|LC ||4||Chris Arkwright"]}, {"page": "List of St Helens R.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"  |Chris Arkwright"]}, {"page": "1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|LF ||13||Chris Arkwright"]}, {"page": "1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|CE ||3||Chris Arkwright"]}, {"page": "St Helens R.F.C.

The club now operate their youth programme out of Cowley Language College's sports facilities, and the clubs system now incorporates a more liberal system, not totally governed by age. Three over twenties can appear for the reserves or Under 20s, and some of the better players of the Under 18s may make a quick transition to the Under 20s if they are good enough. Similarly, some of the first team or Under 20s squad, either those fast tracked too soon, or returning from injury, or simply out of form may be demoted to the Under 20s or Under 18s in order to regain form and playing experience. As well as having Under 18s and 20s sides, St Helens also have two Under 16s sides; a permanent squad made of players on part-time contracts, as well as a service area side based on local amateur players.
