He was the first Cambridge professor to win widespread recognition as a mechanical engineer, and first to set the scientific study of vowels on a respectable foundation. He is now best remembered for his extensive writings on architectural history, including many studies of mediaeval cathedrals and a four-volume treatise on the architecture of the University of Cambridge.

There are also a number of lay canons who all together form the greater chapter which has the legal responsibility both for the cathedral itself and also for the formal election of an archbishop when there is a vacancy-in-see. By English law and custom, they may only elect the person who has been nominated by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister. The Foundation also includes the choristers, lay clerks, organists, King's Scholars, the Six Preachers and a range of other officers; some of these posts are moribund, such as that of the cathedral barber.

Mirabilia Chronometrica, \u2026  (Book 9. Marvelous Clocks, \u2026 ), Caput V. Signa chronometrica optica, seu indices. (Chapter 5. Marvelous visual clocks, or clocks with hands), pp. 664-665: Propositio XX. Indicem sinuosum & obliquatum per anfractus quosvis, sine Rotis dentatis quocumque lubet educere. (Proposition 20. [How], without any gears, to lead the twisting, turning pointer [i.e., the shaft that drives the clock's hands] through any bend one pleases.) In the margin is printed: Vide Iconism. VII. Fig. 32. (See Plate 7, Figure 32.), which depicts Schott's universal joint. Schott first notes that there may be occasions when a clock's gear works and its face can't be conveniently aligned; e.g., public clocks installed in towers. He then mentions, in the description of its construction (Technasma, the Greek word for \"artifice\"), that the universal joint resembles a gimbal that is used to hold an oil lamp so that it won't spill oil. Schott's joint consists of two forks (fuscinula), each of which consists of a shaft to which a metal strip, bent into a semicircle, is attached to one end. Near each end of the semicircle, a hole is drilled. A cross with four perpendicular arms (crux sive 4 brachia) is also made. The holes in each semicircle fit over the ends of an opposing pair of arms. The angle between the shafts must be greater than a right angle. In discussing the joint's motion (Motus), Schott claims that the two shafts move at the same speed (i.e., they form a constant-velocity joint): \" \u2026 horum autem ductum necesse est sequatur & altera fuscinula, parique cum priore illa feratur velocitate: unde si fuerit unius fuscinulae motus regularis circularis, erit similis & alterius \u2026 \" ( \u2026 but this driven [fork] must follow the other [driving] fork, and it be born at a speed equal to the former: whence if one fork's motion were regularly circular, it will be similarly with the other \u2026 ).For a (partial) history of universal joints, see: Robert Willis, Principles of Mechanism \u2026 , 2nd ed. (London, England: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1870), Part the Fifth: On Universal Joints, pp. 437-457. Shortly afterward, between 1667 and 1675, Robert Hooke analysed the joint and found that its speed of rotation was nonuniform, but that this property could be used to track the motion of the shadow on the face of a sundial. In fact, the component of the equation of time which accounts for the tilt of the equatorial plane relative to the ecliptic is entirely analogous to the mathematical description of the universal joint. The first recorded use of the term universal joint for this device was by Hooke in 1676, in his book Helioscopes.\"universal, a. (adv.) and n.\", para.13, Oxford English Dictionary Online, accessed 2010-06-16Hooke first described a universal joint in Hevelius' instrument in: Robert Hooke, Animadversions on the first part of the Machina Coelestis \u2026 (London, England: John Martyn, 1674), p. 73. Here he calls the joint a \"universal Instrument\". From page 73: I shall show \" \u2026 what use I have made of this Joynt, for a universal Instrument for Dialling, for equalling of Time, for making the Hand of a Clock move in the Shadow of a Style, and for performing a multitude of other Mechanical Operations.\" The joint is depicted on Plate X, Fig.s 22 and 23, which are available at: Posner Memorial Collection - Carnegie Mellon University Robert Hooke, A Description of Helioscopes, and Some Other Instruments (London, England: John Martyn, 1676), p. 14. From p. 14: \"The Universal Joynt for all these manner of Operations, having not had time to describe the last Exercise, I shall now more particularly explain.\" Illustrations of Hooke's universal joint appear on p. 40, Fig.s 9 and 10; available at: ETU Library ; Zurich, Switzerland . He published a description in 1678,Review of Ferdinand Berthoud's Treatise on Marine Clocks, Appendix Art. VIII, The Monthly Review or Literary Journal, Vol. L, 1774; see footnote, page 565. resulting in the use of the term Hooke's joint in the English-speaking world. In 1683, Hooke proposed a solution to the nonuniform rotary speed of the universal joint: a pair of Hooke's joints 90\u00b0 out of phase at either end of an intermediate shaft, an arrangement that is now known as a type of constant-velocity joint.Gunther, Robert Theodore, Early Science in Oxford, vol. 7: \"Life and work of Robert Hooke, Part II\" (Oxford, England:  Dawsons of Pall Mall, 1930), pp. 621\u2013622.
