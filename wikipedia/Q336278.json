Tennant had purchased a Korg MS-10 synthesizer which sparked a conversation with Lowe. Discovering that they had a mutual interest in disco and electronic music, they became friends. In particular, the pair had a shared love of two electropop records: \"Souvenir\" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD); and \"Bedsitter\" by Soft Cell, which reflected their lifestyles at the time.

The single reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart and was followed by their debut album, Please, on 24 March. In June 1986, the band announced a European tour; however, their plans for a theatrical extravaganza proved to be too expensive and the tour was cancelled. Please started Pet Shop Boys' penchant for choosing one-word album titles, which Neil Tennant has since stated is now a Pet Shop Boys \"signature thing\", akin to e.e. cummings' use of exclusively lower case letters. New versions of their second single, \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\", and the album track \"Suburbia\" were also released in 1986, followed by Disco.

March 1988 saw the duo achieve their fourth UK number one single (and their last to date), with a remixed edit of \"Heart\", different from the album version. This single version would be included on their first and third greatest hits albums, Discography: The Complete Singles Collection and Ultimate, whereas the album version would be used for their second retrospective, the double PopArt: Pet Shop Boys \u2013 The Hits. The video to the single, directed by Jack Bond, starred Ian McKellen as a vampire who steals Neil Tennant's wife.", "In the 1996 BBC Radio 1 documentary About Pet Shop Boys, Neil Tennant noted that their \"Imperial Phase\" ended in 1988. On 12 September 1988, Pet Shop Boys released a new single, \"Domino Dancing\", and in the documentary Neil recounts his disappointment when hearing the news that the single had reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. He felt that their major success was now over and that it was going to be a challenge to maintain their level of success in the future.", "Neil Tennant worked with Bernard Sumner and Johnny Marr on their first album as Electronic, whose first single, \"Getting Away with It\", co-written and co-produced by Tennant, was released on 4 December 1989. In 1991, Lowe also contributed to the Electronic project, contributing the chord sequence to \"The Patience of a Saint\" on their 1991 album. In 1992, Tennant sang lead vocals on the non-album single \"Disappointed\", which was featured on the soundtrack to the movie Cool World.", "During this time, Pet Shop Boys began to work with playwright Jonathan Harvey on a stage musical project.

Minogue later performed the track live, during her 2005 Showgirl tour, singing to a pre-recorded Neil Tennant. This is not the first time that Pet Shop Boys have worked with Minogue: in 1994, they wrote a song for inclusion on her eponymous Kylie Minogue album, called \"Falling\", which was based on an unreleased remix of \"Go West\" with new lyrics by Tennant; however, Minogue and her record company did not like the production sound of Pet Shop Boys' demo and asked Farley & Heller to finally produce the track.", "After the mixed fortunes of Closer to Heaven, Pet Shop Boys returned to the studio to start work on their eighth album. After toying with genres including hip hop, they went for a stripped back acoustic sound as a complete change from the over-the-top dance music of the musical. In 2002, they released the modestly successful album Release. Most of the tracks were produced by the duo themselves and many featured Johnny Marr on guitar. The first single, \"Home and Dry\", featured a very peculiar video, directed by Wolfgang Tillmans, mostly consisting of raw camcorder footage of mice filmed in the London Underground. The follow-up single \"I Get Along\" had a video filmed by Bruce Weber, and after this they embarked on another world tour, although this time it was a stripped back affair, with no dancers, backing singers, costumes or lavish sets. They used two extra guitarists, Bic Hayes and Mark Refoy, a percussionist (Dawne Adams) and regular programmer (Pete Gleadall) alongside Chris Lowe (keyboards) and Neil Tennant (vocals and guitar).", "In September 2004, Pet Shop Boys appeared at a free concert in Trafalgar Square in London, where they performed, with the Dresdner Sinfoniker orchestra, a whole new soundtrack to accompany the seminal 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin.

Also in 2005, Pet Shop Boys were asked to put together the twentieth release in the Back to Mine series, an ongoing anthology showcasing artists' favourite music selections, with an emphasis on afterhours chill-out music. As a condition, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe were given one disc each, whereas all previous releases in the series consisted of only a single disc per group (see Back to Mine: Pet Shop Boys).", "On 16 October, Catalogue was published by Thames & Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book, written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output (photography, as well as the design of albums, videos, concert tours, books and fan club magazines) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: \"In the beginning we made a decision \u2013 and it was in our EMI contract \u2013 that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; and that we were never going to give up on that.\" Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin.

A lyric video was released for the track \"On Social Media\", the second track to be revealed following the lead track \"Give Stupidity A Chance\". A third track, \"What Are We Going To Do About The Rich?\" was described by Tennant as a sort of \"protest song\". The final song on the EP is titled \"The Forgotten Child\" and is the only non-satirical track, and addresses the issue of refugees and how they are viewed and treated by the rest of humanity.

The same year as Nightlife's release, Minogue also signed to Parlophone and released her hugely successful Light Years album in 2000.

Several of the musical's songs were pre-released on the Pet Shop Boys' 1999 album Nightlife, including Closer to Heaven, In Denial, and Vampires. Nightlife was recorded whilst they were writing Closer to Heaven and originally more of the album's tracks appeared in the musical. The oldest song is Shameless, which originally appeared as the B-side to \"Go West\" in 1993.", "The original run of Closer to Heaven was from May 2001 to September 2001. This was extended to January 2002 because early performances were played to packed audiences. However, over the summer, audiences dwindled. In recent interviews, Neil Tennant has blamed this on poor marketing and bad press reviews. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, the Arts Theatre was worried about the continual fall of audience numbers across London and wanted a big audience puller, so Closer to Heaven closed on 13 October 2001. It was replaced with The Vagina Monologues.", "A new production of the show took place at the 100-seat Above the Stag Theatre in London from July to August 2019.

Because they were dissatisfied with the available digital synthesisers and samples, Pet Shop Boys wanted to use analogue synthesisers. Faltermeyer was a good choice for producer as he happened to be an expert on analogue equipment. The result was a Pet Shop Boys album different from both the previous album, Introspective, and the 1993 follow-up, Very. In places, the album expands upon the synth-pop genre with flavours of guitar pop ballads, as with \"This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave\" and \"My October Symphony\" (a song about the decline of the Soviet Union) featuring guitarist Johnny Marr. Later, singer Neil Tennant would reflect on the different style of Behaviour: \"It was more reflective and more musical-sounding, and also it probably didn't have irritatingly crass ideas in it, like our songs often do\".

There was also a Disco Mix of \"Losing My Mind\". On the limited edition CD, an edit of the Extended Mix of \"This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave\" (which was originally available with the Japanese version of Behaviour) was included along with David Morales' Red Zone mix of \"So Hard\". \"Jealousy\" was later covered by Dubstar.
