He was joined by Yorkshire's Graham Stevenson. They were signed for the second half of the season on a sponsorship arranged through the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) by Whitbread's Brewery. Five of the competition's 15 rounds were abandoned because of adverse weather.Doust (1981), p. 50. It was apparently on this trip that Botham originally fell out with the former Australian captain Ian Chappell. The cause seems to have been a cricket-related argument in a bar, which may have resulted in Chappell being pushed off his stool (the story is widely sourced but accounts differ). This became a long-running feud and, as late as the 2010\u201311 Ashes series, there was an altercation between Botham and Chappell in a car park at the Adelaide Oval."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["Boycott, after much thought, continued as a player at Yorkshire, scoring 1,941\u00a0runs at 61.70 in 1979, hitting six hundreds to pass Len Hutton's record of 129 first-class centuries.McKinstry, p. 236. In 1980 he scored his ninth Roses century, equalling Herbert Sutcliffe's record.Boycott, p. 349. He also finished the season with an average of over 50.00 for a record eleventh consecutive year, surpassing the achievement of Jack Hobbs.Boycott, p. 331. He would experience growing friction with Hutton's son, Yorkshire's Richard, as well as with later Yorkshire captain John Hampshire. In the early 1980s Boycott continued his run of form, although a slow 347-ball knock of 140* incensed captain, Ray Illingworth, and created friction between Boycott and the rest of the Yorkshire Committee. In 1982 Boycott and Graham Stevenson added a record 149 runs for Yorkshire's tenth wicket against Warwickshire, Stevenson scoring 115 of these runs."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Graham Stevenson"]}, {"page": "Ackworth, West Yorkshire", "response": ["The Yorkshire and England fast bowler, Graham Stevenson, was born in Ackworth.
