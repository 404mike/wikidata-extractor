As well as Mars Attacks!, Gems did uncredited rewrite work on Batman (1989). Gems has written unproduced scripts for Burton, including a Beetlejuice (1988) sequel titled Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, an updating of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" set in Burbank, California, The Hawkline Monster, a cowboy/monster movie that was to star Clint Eastwood and Jack Nicholson and Go Baby Go, a beach movie in the style of films by Russ Meyer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Batman (1989 film)", "response": ["The tone and themes of the film were partly influenced by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's The Killing Joke and Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.

Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity to pay homage to the films of Edward D. Wood Jr., especially Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), It Came from Outer Space (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956).", "Warner Bros. spent $20\u00a0million on the movie's marketing campaign; together with $80\u00a0million spent during production, the final combined budget came to $100\u00a0million.

Perhaps they don't create quite enough deeply funny earthlings to go around, but a thoroughly mean-spirited big-budget movie is always a treasurable rarity.\" Jonathan Rosenbaum from the Chicago Reader praised the surreal humor and black comedy, which he found to be in the vein of Dr. Strangelove and Gremlins (1984).
