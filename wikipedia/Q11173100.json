He was most recognised as a co-author of the second of the three papers published sequentially in Nature on 25 April 1953 describing the correct molecular structure of DNA. The first was authored by Francis Crick and James Watson, and the third by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling.\nIn 1993, on the 40th anniversary of the publication of the molecular structure of DNA, a plaque was erected in the Quad (courtyard) of the Strand campus of King's College London, commemorating the contributions of Franklin, Gosling, Stokes, Wilson, and Wilkins to \"DNA X-ray diffraction studies\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine", "response": ["The 1962 Prize awarded to James D. Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins\u2014for their work on DNA structure and properties\u2014did not recognize contributing work from others, such as Alec Stokes and Herbert Wilson. In addition, Erwin Chargaff, Oswald Avery, and Rosalind Franklin (whose key DNA x-ray crystallography work was the most detailed yet least acknowledged among the three) contributed directly to the ability of Watson and Crick to solve the structure of the DNA molecule. Avery died in 1955, Franklin died in 1958 and posthumous nominations for the Nobel Prize are not permitted.  Files of Nobel Prize nominations show Franklin was not nominated when she was alive. As a result of Watson's misrepresentations of Franklin and her role in the discovery of the double helix in his book The Double Helix, Franklin has come to be portrayed as a classic victim of sexism in science. Chargaff, for his part, was not quiet about his exclusion from the prize, bitterly writing to other scientists about his disillusionment regarding the field of molecular biology."]}, {"page": "Macclesfield", "response": ["* Alec Stokes, (1919\u20132003) scientistThe Guardian, Obituary, Alexander Stokes, 15 Feb 2003 retrieved December 2017 worked on X-ray crystallography and DNA was born here."]}, {"page": "Nobel Prize controversies", "response": ["The 1962 prize was awarded to James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material\".
