The Moss sisters are loosely based on her grandmother and her three sisters. Some aspects of the series, such as the grave fund that the girls save for, are taken directly from their lives. Thomas wrote the first complete draft of the script in 1996, but it was almost ten years before it was optioned by the BBC. During that time she lost the script, and had to recreate it from an old copy she found in her attic. Thomas elected to insert certain elements into the script to give the series a sense of realism, such as the slaughter of animals in the Moss home. A variety of actors were cast in Lilies, including native Liverpudlian Kerrie Hayes in her acting debut.", "* Kerrie Hayes as Ruby Moss"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2008", "response": ["|Flick || Peace Arch / AV Pictures / Monster Films || David Howard (director/screenplay); Hugh O'Conor, Faye Dunaway, Liz Smith, Michelle Ryan, Mark Benton, Julia Foster, Terence Rigby, John Woodvine, Richard Hawley, Geoffrey Hughes, Anna Karen, Sara Harris Davies, Hayley Angel Wardle, Kerrie Hayes, Rhys Parry Jones || Horror"]}, {"page": "British Academy Television Award for Best Actress", "response": ["|Kerrie Hayes"]}, {"page": "Good Cop", "response": ["When Stockwell is attacked and killed in a savage ambush on a routine call out to a domestic disturbance, Rocksavage's life is changed forever.
