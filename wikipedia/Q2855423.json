The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, in the form of a grant of \u00a320,000 (2008: \u00a31.5\u00a0million) to clear the most pressing obligations.

Robert Mackay stated that a celebrated writer had asserted that one of the clans who took part in the battle, the Clan Kay or Quhele, was the Clan Mackay. However, Mackay was of the opinion that the Clan Quhele described in the earliest account of the battle by Andrew of Wyntoun was the Clan Cameron. William Forbes Skene was of the opposing opinion that the Clan Quhele was the Mackintoshes of Clan Chattan.

Scott's ship Terra Nova had left Cardiff amid much publicity on 15\u00a0June, and was due to arrive in Australia early in October. It was to Melbourne that Amundsen sent his telegram, containing the bare information that he was proceeding southwards. No indication was given of the Norwegian's plans or his destination in Antarctica; Scott wrote to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) secretary, John Scott Keltie: \"We shall know in due course I suppose\". News of Amundsen's revised plans reached Norway early in October and provoked a generally hostile response. Although Nansen gave his blessing and warm approval, Amundsen's actions were with few exceptions condemned by press and public, and funding dried up almost completely.  Reactions in Britain were predictably adverse; an initial disbelief expressed by Keltie soon turned to anger and scorn. \"I have sent full details of Amundsen's underhand conduct to Scott\u00a0... If I was Scott I would not let them land\", wrote Sir Clements Markham, the influential former RGS president.  Unaware of the world's reactions, Fram sailed south for four months.
