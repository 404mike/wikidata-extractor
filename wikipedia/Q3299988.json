The St Helens squad sees Francis Meli absent as the big Kiwi and Samoa wing is in his native Samoa on compassionate grounds. His place is likely to be taken by Gary Wheeler or Jonny Lomax. Elsewhere, Saints are at full strength, with no place available for second-rows Matty Ashurst or Andy Dixon or prop Gareth Frodsham in the initial 19-man squad.", "The game sees St Helens' big winger Francis Meli return to the initial 19-man squad for the round 2 game at the Odsal Stadium. second-row Matty Ashurst also comes back into contention for Saints. They take the places of centre Iosia Soliola who is out for three to four weeks with an ankle problem and wing Ade Gardner who has and intercostal muscle injury and is out of contention for six to eight weeks. Talismanic hooker and skipper Keiron Cunningham was due to earn his 500th cap in the professional game but missed the fixture due to a family bereavement.", "St Helens got back-to-back wins after a comfortable win over the Dragons in Perpignan. However, it was the Dragons who got the better of the opening exchanges, with Setaimata Sa and Chris Walker going over inside the first ten minutes. Neither scores were converted, but Catalans had an 8-0 lead. However, on the 15 minute mark, Saints found their cutting edge and began to tick, with young winger Jonny Lomax latching on to an inch-perfect Paul Wellens chip. Despite James Graham being off the field with  suspected concussion and Jonny Lomax being caught by a dangerous tackle by Olivier Elima which resulted in the French captain's sending off, St Helens pressed on and it was Lomax, who shrugged off the shot from Elima to cut inside his opposing winger to score a brilliant try. Kyle Eastmond scored a goal from the touchline for a 10-8 St Helens lead, and with the extra man advantage, it was looking ominous for the Dragons. Francis Meli got his first of the season after a fine kick form the in-form Leon Pryce, and shortly after, Matt Gidley cut back inside his winger to finish a fine move for the first of his two tries of the evening. Half-time - 8-18 to Saints. The second-half continued in a similar guise, with Maurie Fa'asavalu scoring a trade-mark, barnstorming try under the posts. Eastmond was next to score, Gidley cutting through the defence and flicking the ball back on the inside to Eastmond who sped 30 meters for a fine try. Meli then crossed for his second, finishing well a break from Matty Ashurst. Gidley then got his brace, with a trademark, show and go on the outside to score. That was the end of the St Helens scoring, but by no means the end of the action, with Bryn Hargreaves and Scott Moore involved in a brawl with the Catalans forwards. Walker got his second with five minutes remaining, but the win was in the bag by the hour mark.", "Preview:The game will St Helens' talismanic skipper Keiron Cunningham return to the fold to make his 500th appearance in professional rugby, following the sudden death of his mother, Annie. However, winger Ade Gardner and centre Sia Soliola still miss out through rib and ankle injuries respectively. Also, second rowers Jon Wilkin and Chris Flannery will both miss the game with shoulder problems, therefore meaning Matty Ashurst will deputise for his first appearance of 2010."]}, {"page": "2012 Leeds Rhinos season", "response": ["| Salford Squad || 1 Luke Patten, 18 Ashley Gibson, 14 Chris Nero, 3 Sean Gleeson, 5 Danny Williams, 6 Daniel Holdsworth, 7 Matty Smith, 12 Shannan McPherson, 24 Stuart Howarth, 8 Lee Jewitt, 11 Matty Ashurst, 27 Vinnie Anderson, 13 Stephen Wild Subs 16 Luke Adamson, 17 Iafeta Palea'aesina, 21 Jordan James, 23 Gareth Owen", "| Salford Squad || 1 Luke Patten, 2 Jodie Broughton, 3 Sean Gleeson, 4 Joel Moon, 18 Ashley Gibson, 6 Daniel Holdsworth, 7 Matty Smith, 15 Adam Sidlow, 9 Wayne Godwin, 10 Lee Jewitt, 11 Matty Ashurst, 16 Luke Adamson, 13 Stephen Wild Subs 14 Chris Nero, 17 Iafeta Paleaaesina, 21 Jordan James, 24 Stuart Howarth"]}, {"page": "Ashurst (surname)", "response": ["*Matty Ashurst (born 1989), English rugby league footballer "]}, {"page": "2014 Salford Red Devils season", "response": ["|19|| Matty Ashurst ||B ||SR", "|19|| Matty Ashurst ||12px ||B ||B ||SR ||SR ||x ||x ||B ||B ||SR ||x ||B ||B ||B ||SR ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x", "|19|| Matty Ashurst ||x ||x", "|Matty Ashurst"]}, {"page": "2015 Salford Red Devils season", "response": ["|Matty Ashurst"]}, {"page": "2015 Wakefield Trinity Wildcats season", "response": ["|17|| Matty Ashurst ||x ||SR ||x ||L ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||x ||SR ||SR ||x ||SR ||SR ||SR ||SR ||SR ||SR ||B ||12px", "|17|| Matty Ashurst ||x ||x ", "|Matty Ashurst", "| Matty Ashurst"]}]}}
