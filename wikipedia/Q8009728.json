In 1914, after winning a literary contest in The Connoisseur for an essay on Shakespeare's The Tempest, his thoughts seriously turned to becoming a critic. He served briefly in World War I, fighting in the Durham Light Infantry in 1918, until the war ended that year. The following year he attended Worcester College, Oxford, where he read modern history and participated in the Art Society. At Oxford, his friends included John Rothenstein and Cyril Connolly. Graduating with honours in 1922, he studied at the Ruskin School of Drawing and wrote reviews of art exhibitions.He worked as a free-lance contributor for The Studio magazine, editing several special issues. Gaunt was fascinated by the Pre-Raphaelites, at that time undervalued as Victorian. He published in 1942 his most enduring title on that subject, The Pre-Raphaelite Tragedy. He completed an M.A. in 1926. In 1930 he published a collection of his drawings, called London Promenade. 1935 he married Mary Catherine Reilly Connolly (died, 1980). The years 1930-39 were spent writing literary and artistic criticism, including The Pre-Raphaelite Tragedy. During the Second World-War, he took a special appointment for the war effort and researched for the book The Aesthetic Adventure.  The Gaunts lived in a country cottage near the Surrey Hampshire borders.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elizabeth Siddal", "response": ["During this period Siddall also began to write poetry, often with dark themes about lost love or the impossibility of true love. \"Her verses were as simple and moving as ancient ballads; her drawings were as genuine in their medieval spirit as much more highly finished and competent works of Pre-Raphaelite art,\" wrote critic William Gaunt. Both Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown supported and admired her work."]}, {"page": "English art", "response": ["*William Gaunt, A Concise History of English Painting (London, 1978)", "*William Gaunt, The Great Century of British Painting: Hogarth to Turner (London, 1971)"]}, {"page": "William Gaunt", "response": ["Between 1983 and 1987, he starred as harassed father Arthur Crabtree in the sitcom No Place Like Home.

A number of major British museums held events and exhibits in 1948 to mark the centenary of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, but fashionable art critics such as Wyndham Lewis mocked the PRB as a pretentious irrelevance.
