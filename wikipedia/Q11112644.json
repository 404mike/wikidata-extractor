However the shows abruptly stopped in the early 20th century for an unknown reason. In 2000, they were revived as an annual event. Prizes were traditionally awarded by John Vane, 11th Baron Barnard until his death in 2016. The newly revived event has taken place annually except in 2001 due to the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak. During the outbreak, there was concern that Langdon Beck's only hostel could close due to lack of tourism. It received a grant of \u00a31,000 from Teesdale District Council for solar power with extra funding from Durham County Council.
