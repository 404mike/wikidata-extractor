Although the action is taken from The Merry Wives of Windsor, some commentators feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare's play into a wholly Italian work. The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy: \"it was all done through the music\".Osborne, p. 406 In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in The Observer, \"Because of Shakespeare we like to think of Falstaff as a work that has a certain Englishness. In fact the opera is no more English than Aida is Egyptian. Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight into one of the archetypes of opera buffa.\"Heyworth, Peter. \"Falstaff and the Verdi canon\", The Observer, 14 May 1961, p. 26 Verdi himself, however, felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian buffo character, but portrays Shakespeare's fuller, more ambiguous Falstaff of the Henry IV plays: \"My Falstaff is not merely the hero of The Merry Wives of Windsor, who is simply a buffoon, and allows himself to be tricked by the women, but also the Falstaff of the two parts of Henry IV. Boito has written the libretto in accordance.\" A contemporary critic argued that the text \"imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare's verse\", but Hepokoski notes Boito's use of traditional Italian metric conventions."]}, {"page": "Pierre Boulez", "response": ["The first piece completed at IRCAM was R\u00e9pons (1980\u20131984). In this forty-minute work an instrumental ensemble is placed in the middle of the hall, while six soloists surround the audience: two pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibraphone and glockenspiel/xylophone. It is their music which is transformed electronically and projected through the space. Peter Heyworth described the moment when they enter, some ten minutes into the piece: \"it is as though a great window were thrown open, through which a new sound world enters, and with it a new world of the imagination. Even more impressive is the fact that there is no longer a schism between the worlds of natural and electronic sounds, but rather a continuous spectrum.\"Heyworth (1982).", "According to Peter Heyworth, Boulez produced a lean, athletic sound which, underpinned by his rhythmic exactitude, could generate an electric sense of excitement. The ability to reveal the structure of a score and to clarify dense orchestral textures were hallmarks of his conducting. He conducted without a baton and, as Heyworth observed: \"there is no trace of theatre\u2014not even the rather theatrical sort of economy that was practised by Richard Strauss.\"Heyworth (1986), 25\u201326.

Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e is the more neglected of the two, with only a handful of performances in more than a century.Duchen, p. 197 Copland considered P\u00e9n\u00e9lope (1913) a fascinating work, and one of the best operas written since Wagner; he noted, however, that the music is, as a whole, \"distinctly non-theatrical.\" The work uses leitmotifs, and the two main roles call for voices of heroic quality, but these are the only ways in which the work is Wagnerian. In Faur\u00e9's late style, \"tonality is stretched hard, without breaking.\"Murray, p. 120 On the rare occasions when the piece has been staged, critical opinion has generally praised the musical quality of the score, but has varied as to the dramatic effectiveness of the work. When the opera was first presented in London in 1970, in a student production by the Royal Academy of Music, Peter Heyworth wrote, \"A score that offers rich rewards to an attentive ear can none the less fail to cut much ice in the theatre.\u00a0...

In the words of the critic Peter Heyworth, \"the Corporation's music department had become a byword for its narrow-mindedness and lassitude\". Boult had been followed as director of music by a series of successors between 1944 and 1959 who either lacked his commitment to modern music or were actively hostile to it. Richard Howgill, who held the post from 1952 to 1959, took the view that although Webern \"might have been a small composer of some significance, Schoenberg wasn't really a composer at all.\"  In addition to working under a conductor it disliked, the BBC SO found its role as a pioneer of progressive music gone, and its performances of the standard classics criticised as under-rehearsed (particularly during Proms seasons) compared with those given by Legge's Philharmonia and others. Sargent's contract was not renewed in 1957, although he continued as chief conductor of the Proms until his death ten years later. Howgill appointed Rudolf Schwarz as chief conductor of the BBC SO. Schwarz failed to restore orchestral standards to pre-war levels, and lacked Sargent's box-office appeal. Under Schwarz, BBC SO concerts other than the Proms drew poor houses \u2013 as low as 29 per cent of capacity in the 1959\u201360 season.Kenyon, p. 292 The manager of the Royal Festival Hall, Ernest Bean, spoke of \"an inherited aura of mediocrity about BBC concerts which keeps people away\".
