Despite having a low-profile playing career, Wilkinson embarked on a successful managerial career. He won the First Division championship in 1992 with Leeds United, the final season before the creation of the Premier League. As FA Technical Director he was instrumental in the planning and development of English football's first National Football Centre. To date, he remains the last English manager to win the top-flight league in England.

It was not until the appointment of Jack Charlton as manager in 1977 that the club started to climb back up the league pyramid.

Cantona made his debut for Leeds in a 2\u20130 loss at Oldham Athletic on 8 February 1992. At Leeds, he was part of the team that won the final Football League First Division title before it was replaced by the Premier League as the top division in English football. He made 15 appearances, and despite only scoring three goals, he was instrumental in their title success, primarily with assists for leading goalscorer Lee Chapman. Cantona scored his first goal for Leeds in a 2\u20130 win at home to Luton Town on 29 February, and set up the other goal for Chapman.Auclair (2009), p. 193. Having played little football in the six weeks before signing for Leeds, Cantona struggled to find a place in an established line-up, with manager Howard Wilkinson preferring to put him on against tiring defences. Against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 7 March, Cantona came off the bench to set up a goal for Gary McAllister, securing a win that moved Leeds two points ahead of Manchester United, who had a game in hand, in the title race.Auclair (2009), pp. 193\u20135. Cantona was deployed as a part of a front three, along with Chapman and Rod Wallace, in a 5\u20131 thrashing of Wimbledon at Elland Road on 14 March, scoring Leeds' fourth goal of the game.Auclair (2009), p. 196."]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 FA Premier League", "response": ["|  Howard Wilkinson", "|  Howard Wilkinson"]}, {"page": "Sheffield Hallam University", "response": ["* Howard Wilkinson, Football Association technical director, former Leeds United and Sheffield Wednesday manager "]}, {"page": "George Graham (footballer, born 1944)", "response": ["After serving his ban, Graham's return to football management came with Leeds United in September 1996.

In the 2003 close season, the resignation of Graham Taylor at Aston Villa saw Graham's name mentioned by the media as a possible successor, but again nothing came of it, with this vacancy being filled by David O'Leary, who had played under Graham at Arsenal and worked as his assistant at Leeds.

After surviving relegation at the end of the season, Sirrel became the club's general manager, with his assistant Howard Wilkinson taking over as manager. County survived relegation a little more comfortably the following season, but Wilkinson was tempted away by the manager's job at his boyhood club, Sheffield Wednesday, and the board recruited former Wigan Athletic manager Larry Lloyd to replace him. Despite a good run to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, where they were knocked out by eventual winners Everton, the club had a poor league campaign that ultimately resulted in their relegation. This poor form continued into the following season, resulting in Lloyd's dismissal with the club bottom of the Second Division.

When Reid was sacked in October and replaced by Howard Wilkinson, Flo immediately fell out of favour \u2013 failing to make the bench for Wilkinson's first game \u2013 as Wilkinson publicly called into question the Norwegian's fitness.

He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles. Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband.
