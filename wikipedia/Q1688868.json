Both instruments were gifts from her godmother, Ism\u00e9na Holland, the wife of composer Theodore Holland. She performed with the 1673 Stradivarius from 1961 until 1964, when she acquired the Davidov. Many of her most famous recordings were made on this instrument, including the Elgar Concerto with Barbirolli, the Robert Schumann Cello Concerto with Barenboim and the two Brahms cello sonatas. From 1969 to 1970 she (like Casals before her) played on a Francesco Goffriller cello, and in 1970 acquired a modern instrument from the Philadelphia violin maker Sergio Peresson. It was the Peresson cello that du Pr\u00e9 played for the remainder of her career until 1973, using it for a second, live, recording of the Elgar Concerto, and her last studio recording, of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin's Cello Sonata in G minor and C\u00e9sar Franck's Violin Sonata in A arranged for cello, in December 1971."]}, {"page": "Joseph Joachim", "response": ["* Theodore Holland (1878\u20131947), British composer and teacher."]}, {"page": "Robert Kahn (composer)", "response": ["After finishing his military service, Kahn worked as a freelance composer in Berlin until 1890.
