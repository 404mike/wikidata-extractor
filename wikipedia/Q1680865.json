He is best known as one of the leading figures in the land boom of the 1880s and especially the subsequent crash of the early 1890s, where his Christian morals were seen to clash with his business activities. He was also the former Commonwealth Secretary, and an able Minister in Victorian Liberal-National governments in Melbourne, Perth and Canberra, the longest-serving major Minister for Australian colonies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 7", "response": ["*1832 \u2013 James Munro, Scottish-Australian publisher and politician, 15th Premier of Victoria (d. 1908)"]}, {"page": "Premier of Victoria", "response": ["| James Munro"]}, {"page": "Premiers and chief ministers of the Australian states and territories", "response": ["Until the rise of the Australian Labor Party in the 1890s, the Australian colonies did not have formal party systems, although many colonial politicians called themselves Liberals or Conservatives. Ministries were usually formed on the basis of personal or factional loyalties, and rose and fell with great frequency as loyalties changed. Colonial politics were commonly regarded as parochial, corrupt and cynical, and in many cases they were. Victorian Premier James Munro, for example, fled the colony to escape his creditors in 1890, and Queensland Premier Sir Thomas McIlwraith was notoriously corrupt."]}, {"page": "Armadale, Victoria", "response": ["Armadale is named after Armadale, Sutherland in Scotland. This was because one of Armadale notable residents, James Munro, 15th Premier of Victoria, was born in Armadale, Sutherland. Armadale Post Office on High Street opened on 2 October 1884. The Armadale North Post Office, near Toorak Station, opened in 1940."]}, {"page": "Outer Circle railway line", "response": ["Agitation for the Outer Circle line was then taken over by politicians and land speculators. It was included in the 1882 Railway Construction Act, and was authorised by the 1884 Railway Construction Act, passed on 12 December 1884. The act also authorised the construction of a viaduct connecting Flinders Street and Spencer Street stations. By 1885, two of the parliamentarians who had helped gain approval for the line, F.E.

His family settled in the Gippsland region of Victoria, and he eventually acquired a sheep station near Lake Wellington.

He replaced Turner as premier in 1899, but was defeated at the following year's general election. McLean entered the new federal parliament in 1901, as a member of the Protectionist Party. He was a leader of its conservative wing, and in 1904 crossed the floor to become Minister for Trade and Customs in the Reid Government. He was the de facto deputy prime minister. The government was defeated in 1905, and he lost his seat at the 1906 election.", "McLean was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Gippsland North in May 1880.

He became a minister without portfolio in the liberal government of George Turner in 1894, but resigned in April 1898. On 5 December 1899, he moved and carried a vote of no-confidence, becoming Premier and Chief Secretary, but his government lasted less than a year.
