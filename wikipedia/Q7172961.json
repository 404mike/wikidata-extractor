When Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan failed at the box office, Sean Cunningham wanted to reacquire the rights to Friday the 13th and begin working with New Line Cinema on Freddy vs. Jason (New Line owned Nightmare on Elm Street). Paramount and New Line wanted the license to the other's character so they could control a crossover film. Negotiations on the project collapsed, and Paramount made Jason Takes Manhattan. After Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan was released in 1989, the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto (who sold them to New Line). Before Cunningham could begin to work on Freddy vs. Jason, Wes Craven returned to New Line to make New Nightmare. This put Freddy vs. Jason on hold, but allowed Cunningham to bring Jason back with Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday.Bracke, Peter, pp.218\u2013219 The ninth installment \"turned a healthy profit\".Bracke, Peter, pg. 238 Cunningham's \"frustration\" with the delayed development of Freddy vs. Jason led him to create Jason X to keep the series alive. Based on Jason Takes Manhattans concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the tenth film put the titular character in space.Bracke, Peter, pp.242\u2013243 The film lost its biggest supporter with the resignation of president of production Michael De Luca. Lack of support let the finished film sit for two years before it was released on April 26, 2002. It was the series' lowest-grossing film at the domestic box office, and had the largest budget of any of the films to date.Bracke, Peter, pp.263\u2013264 New Line spent a reported $6 million on script development alone from several different writers. Cyrus Voris & Ethan Reiff were commissioned by De Luca alongside Lewis Abernathy & Sean S. Cunningham. Neither draft was well liked by the studio so Brannon Braga & Ronald D. Moore were hired to bring the project in a new direction. David J. Schow was given an offer to write the script because he just happened to walk by De Luca's office one day. David S. Goyer and James Dale Robinson both subsequently rewrote the Voris/Reiff draft. Rob Bottin, known for his make-up work on The Thing and Total Recall, was selected to direct the film in 1997. Mark Verheiden entered the project in the late '90s and proposed releasing the film with two different endings; one with Freddy winning and one with Jason winning. Peter Briggs, Jason X writer Todd Farmer and screenwriting duo Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger were all later brought in to write for the film. Newcomers Mark Swift & Damian Shannon were hired after delivering a pitch that De Luca was happy with. Goyer returned to the project once again in an effort to trim \"every ounce of fat\" from Swift & Shannon's 120-page script. According to Swift and Shannon, several endings were considered for the film; one involved Pinhead of the Hellraiser franchise, but New Line did not want to secure the rights for the character."]}, {"page": "Alien vs. Predator (film)", "response": ["The concept of Alien vs. Predator originated from the Aliens versus Predator comic book in 1989. It was also hinted at when an Alien skull appeared in a trophy case aboard the Predator ship in Predator 2.

In 1991, he successfully pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, who owned the film franchises, although the company did not move forward with the project until 2002.

Briggs' script, entitled Hellraiser: Lament, set out to expand upon the first four films, ignoring Hellraiser: Inferno and Hellraiser: Hellseeker. Other potential subtitles considered were Jihad, Nemesis, and The New Order. Briggs' pitch was discarded for being too high budgeted, leading to the studio opting to retool Neil Marshall Stevens's spec script Deader, which was submitted to Dimension Films in 2000 during the production of his script Thirteen Ghosts and had been planned to be produced by Stan Winston. As in the final film, it entailed a newspaper reporter being sent to Romania to cover an underground cult who have discovered the secret of immortality and had gained contact with an otherworldly dimension, but did not feature connections to the Hellraiser series. Although Tim Day had wanted to write a direct sequel to Hellraiser: Hellseeker featuring a final conflict between Pinhead and Kirsty, Bob Weinstein directed him to rewrite Deader into a Hellraiser sequel similar in tone to the Japanese horror films Ring, and Pulse. After a brief delay during the production of the 2006 American remake of Pulse, work on Deader resumed. Scott Derrickson was approached to direct but declined, and Rick Bota was rehired from the previous film. The film was originally rewritten to take place in London and later the Lower East Side of Manhattan before the producers opted to film it simultaneously with another Hellraiser sequel, titled Hellraiser: Hellworld in Romania, between October and December 2002, to save costs. Production was difficult due to the inability of the Americans in the cast and crew to understand the Romanian set workers and actors."]}, {"page": "Hellboy II: The Golden Army", "response": ["In 2010, Hellboy screenwriter Peter Briggs was asked by Universal to script a spin-off centring on Prince Nuada, and provisionally agreed that Briggs could direct the film in New Zealand.
