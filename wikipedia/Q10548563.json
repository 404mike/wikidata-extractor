The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, pp. 157\u2013158."]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["Revie had improved his goal tally to 13 in the 1953\u201354 season, but only once the Revie Plan was implemented in the 1954\u201355 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities. The new tactic opened with a 5\u20130 defeat to Preston North End, but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside-forward and the team clicked. Though the tactic was named after Revie, it had initially been introduced at reserve team level by Johnny Williamson, though Revie's superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level. City's league title campaign fell away but they went on to reach the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3\u20131 by Newcastle United; a first-half injury to Jimmy Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively. At the end of the season Revie was named as FWA Footballer of the Year."]}, {"page": "Gerry Baker", "response": ["By this time, top English clubs were beginning to notice and in November 1960, Manchester City paid \u00a317,000 for him (the deal also involved defender John McTavish moving in the opposite direction).The Fabulous Baker Boys, Tom Maxwell, 2013,  Baker spent only the remainder of the 1960\u201361 season and the beginning of 1961\u201362 with City, before they sold his contract to Hibernian for \u00a318,000 in November 1961. Over the next two years, Baker scored 43 goals in 84 games for Hibs before moving to Ipswich Town in December 1963. Ipswich paid \u00a325,000 for him, and the player more than returned this investment by scoring 66 goals in 151 games. Ipswich then transferred Baker to Coventry City in November 1967. Over the next two seasons, he scored only six times in thirty games with Coventry. In October 1969, Coventry loaned Baker to Brentford where he scored two goals in eight games; he was released by Coventry at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "McTavish", "response": ["*John McTavish (footballer, born 1885), Scottish footballer", "*John McTavish (footballer, born 1932), Scottish footballer", "*John McTavish (politician), Canadian politician"]}, {"page": "John McTavish", "response": ["John McTavish or John MacTavish, or variant thereof, may refer to:", ";John McTavish", "*John McTavish (footballer, born 1885)", "*John McTavish (footballer, born 1932)", "*John McTavish (politician), 1837-1888"]}, {"page": "John McTavish (footballer born 1932)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John McTavish (footballer, born 1932)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["* Jock McTavish, Bob McTavish (brother), John McTavish (nephew)The Spurs Alphabet (page 284), Bob Goodwin, 2017, "]}, {"page": "John McTavish (at least 2 footballers such named)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John McTavish (footballer, born 1932)"]}, {"page": "John McTavish (footballer born xxxx)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John McTavish (footballer, born 1932)"]}]}}
