After Sandhurst, he joined the Indian Army as an officer of the 21st Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry. During the First World War, he served with the Camel Corps in British Somaliland, where he joined in the British fight against the Darawiish monarch  Diiriye Guure. In 1925, Ismay became an Assistant Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID). After being promoted to the rank of colonel, he served as the military secretary for Lord Willingdon, the Viceroy of India, then returned to the CID as Deputy Secretary in 1936.\nOn 1 August 1938, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Ismay became the Committee's Secretary and began planning for the impending war. In May 1940, when Winston Churchill became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he selected Ismay as his chief military assistant and staff officer. In that capacity, Ismay served as the principal link between Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Ismay also accompanied Churchill to many of the Allied war conferences. For Ismay's advice and aid, \"Churchill owed more, and admitted that he owed more\" to him \"than to anybody else, military or civilian, in the whole of the war.\"After the end of the war, Ismay remained in the army for another year, and helped to reorganise the Ministry of Defence. He then retired from the military and served as Lord Mountbatten of Burma's Chief of Staff in India, helping to oversee its partition. From 1948 to 1951, he served as chairman of the council of the Festival of Britain, helping to organise and promote the event. Then, in 1951, when Churchill again became Prime Minister, he appointed Ismay Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations. \nIsmay accepted the position, but resigned after only six months to become the first Secretary General of NATO in 1952. He served in this role until 1957, and helped establish and define the position. After retiring from NATO, Ismay wrote his memoirs, The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay, served on a variety of corporate boards, and co-chaired the Ismay\u2013Jacob Committee, which reorganised the Ministry of Defence once again. He died on 17 December 1965, at his home, Wormington Grange, Gloucestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nainital", "response": ["* Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay, first secretary general of NATO"]}, {"page": "Hastings Lionel Ismay", "response": ["#redirect Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay"]}, {"page": "Hastings Ismay", "response": ["#redirect Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay"]}, {"page": "Hastings Lionel Ismay, 1st Lord Ismay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay"]}, {"page": "List of knights and ladies of the Garter", "response": ["| Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay"]}, {"page": "Ismay", "response": ["*Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay, British soldier and Chief of Staff during World War II"]}, {"page": "Flag of NATO", "response": ["The council stipulated that the design had to be \"simple and striking,\" in addition to highlighting the \"peaceful purpose\" of the Treaty; several proposals were rejected. An emblem of NATO was finally adopted on October 14, 1953.  The decision was announced by Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay \u2013 the first Secretary General of NATO \u2013 exactly two weeks later on October 28, where he also elaborated on the symbolism behind the chosen design. He described the flag as \"simple and inoffensive.\"  However, the flag was not universally well-received, and attracted criticism from for instance US Congressman John Travers Wood, who condemned the flag as a \"strange and alien rag.\"  He made the remarks in light of an alleged incident where the flag of the United States was reportedly replaced by the NATO flag in Norfolk, Virginia, the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic."]}]}}
