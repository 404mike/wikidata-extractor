When it came time to record their sixth effort, frontman Norman Blake felt as though the band were in a positive place. He later considered it to be a continuation of the band's previous album, Grand Prix, and the new effort was co-produced with that album's producer, David Bianco. The bulk of recording with Bianco was completed at Ridge Farm in Surrey in mid-1996. However, the group had a \"falling out\" with Bianco during the recording process, so the album was finished with the help of George Shilling at London's Air Studios in late 1996. Choosing London was a conscious effort, as the band hoped to switch their locale during each recording process."]}, {"page": "Extricate", "response": ["*George Shilling \u2013 engineering"]}, {"page": "About Time (Steve Winwood album)", "response": ["* Engineer \u2013 George Shilling"]}, {"page": "Lucky Soul", "response": ["The band's debut album, The Great Unwanted, was released on 9 April 2007.
