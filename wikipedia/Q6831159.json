The term gained currency in art circles in Tuscany in the fourteenth century.The texts from five contracts and other documents 1376\u20131508 published by Michael Hirst (Hirst and Carmen Bambach Cappel, \"A Note on the Word Modello', The Art Bulletin 74.1 (March 1992:172\u2013173) are all Tuscan, as Hirst remarks, though the contemporaneous term extended as far as the Marche. Modern definitions in reference works vary somewhat. Alternative and overlapping terms are \"oil sketch\" (schizzo) and \"cartoon\" for paintings, tapestry, or stained glass, maquette, plastico or bozzettoA bozzetto is a roughly-modelled preliminary sketch in clay for a sculpture; those that survive have mostly been kiln-fired to preserve them. for sculpture or architecture, or architectural model.Fourteenth century uses of modello in connection with Santa Reparata, Florence, are noted in A. Grote, Studien zur Geschichte der Opera Santa Reparata zu Florenz in Vierzehnten Jahrhundert (Munich 1960:113ff).", "Though in Gothic figural arts bishops and abbots are often represented carrying small simulacraThe Latin term modulus, a synonym of typus, \"archetype\" is given as source for the usage in the Tusacan Accademia della Crusca's early dictionaries; other early dictionary definitions in Italian are noted by Carmen Bambach Cappel 1992:173. See also Donor portrait of buildings they had constructed\u2014\"models\" in the familiar modern sense\u2014modello is only used of pieces which pre-date the finished work, and were at least in part produced by the main artist involved.Michelangelo was in the habit of assigning to members of his studio modelli done to his specifications: \"in Michelagelo studies the presentation drawings are understood to be the group of finished drawings that Michelangelo gave to his friends such as Tommaso de' Cavallieri\", remarked Bernadine Barnes (Barnes \"A Lost Modello for Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment'\" Master Drawings 26.3 (Autumn 1988:239\u2013248) p. 247 note 4) in justifying her use of modello for the lost original of two copies in public collections. In the case of architectural modelli, the actual construction could be by craftsmen from drawings by the architect. A discussion about a Hieronymous Bosch drawing that illustrates when the term is appropriate to use is in note 23 on page 21 of: J.O. Hand & M. Wolff, Early Netherlandish Painting, National Gallery of Art, Washington catalogue (Cambridge UP), 1986, ; the correspondence concerning the appropriateness or not of modello applied by Michael Hirst to presentation drawings by Michelangelo that were \"done expressly for patronal approval, criticism or rejection\" (Hirst, Michelangelo and His Drawings, 1988:79) is noted above. The less frequently found term ricordo (Italian for \"record\" or \"memory\") means a similar piece produced as a small copy after completion of the work as a record for the workshop.A small finished bronze representing a completed sculpture on a reduced scale, made for a connoisseur or the art market, is a reduction. Naturally it is not always easy for art historians to decide whether a particular piece is one or the other, and, especially in the Late Renaissance and Baroque periods, when several versions of a painting were made, the ricordo for the prime version might serve in the atelier as the modello for the subsequent ones.See: Jonathan Brown, Richard G. Mann; Spanish Paintings of the Fifteenth Through Nineteenth Centuries: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art Systematic Catalogue, National Gallery of Art, Oxford University Press US, 1990, . In the last paragraph of p.73, the view is advanced that an El Greco was produced as a ricordo for the first version of a work, and then used as the modello for a second version. No doubt a modello was often modified after the main work was completed to reflect any changes in the composition during painting, thus making it a ricordo also; this would normally be impossible for art historians to distinguish from a modello altered during its original production."]}, {"page": "Accademia delle Arti del Disegno", "response": ["The Accademia awards the title of Accademico d'Onore, or honorary member, to those it considers notable in culture and the arts.
