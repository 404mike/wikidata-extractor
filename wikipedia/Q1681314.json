Composers were often associated with either Dublin Castle or one of the Dublin cathedrals (St Patrick's and Christ Church). These include immigrants in the 18th century such as Johann Sigismund Cousser, Matthew Dubourg, and Tommaso Giordani. Thomas Roseingrave and his brother Ralph were prominent Irish baroque composers. Among the next generation of composers were the Cork-born Philip Cogan (1750\u20131833), a prominent composer of piano music including concertos, John Andrew Stevenson (1761\u20131833), who is best known for his publications of Irish Melodies with poet Thomas Moore, who also wrote operas, religious music, catches, glees, odes, and songs. In the early 19th century Irish-born composers dominated English-language opera in England and Ireland, including Charles Thomas Carter (c.1735\u20131804), Michael Kelly (1762\u20131826), Thomas Simpson Cooke (1782\u20131848), William Henry Kearns (1794\u20131846), Joseph Augustine Wade (1801\u20131845) and, later in the century, Michael W. Balfe (1808\u20131870) and William Vincent Wallace (1812\u20131865). John Field (1782\u20131837) has been credited with the creation of the Nocturne form, which influenced Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. John William Glover (1815\u20131899), Joseph Robinson (1815\u20131898) and Robert Prescott Stewart (1825\u20131894) kept Irish classical music in Dublin alive in the 19th century, while mid-19th-century emigrants include George William Torrance and George Alexander Osborne. Charles Villiers Stanford (1852\u20131924) and Hamilton Harty (1879\u20131941) were among the last emigrants in Irish music, combining a late romantic musical language with Irish folklorism. Their contemporary in Ireland was the Italian immigrant Michele Esposito (1855\u20131929), a figure of seminal importance in Irish music who arrived in Ireland in 1882. The years after Irish independence were a difficult period in which composers tried to find an identifiable Irish voice in an anti-British climate, which included ressentiments against classical music as such. The development of Irish broadcasting in the 1920s and the gradual enlargement of the Radio \u00c9ireann Orchestra in the late 1930s improved the situation. Important composers in these years were John F. Larchet (1884\u20131967), Ina Boyle (1889\u20131967), Arthur Duff (1899\u20131956), Aloys Fleischmann (1910\u20131992), Frederick May (1911\u20131985), Joan Trimble (1915\u20132000), and Brian Boydell (1917\u20132000). The middle decades of the 20th century were also shaped by A.J. Potter (1918\u20131980), Gerard Victory (1921\u20131995), James Wilson (1922\u20132005), Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada (1931\u20131971), John Kinsella (b. 1932), and Se\u00f3irse Bodley (b. 1933). Prominent names among the older generation of living composers in Ireland today are Frank Corcoran (b. 1944), Eric Sweeney (b. 1948), John Buckley (b. 1951), Gerald Barry (b. 1952), Raymond Deane (b. 1953), Patrick Cassidy (b. 1956), and Fergus Johnston (b. 1959) (see also List of Irish classical composers).", "The Celtic Renaissance after 1900 created works such as Muirgheis (1903) by Thomas O'Brien Butler, Connla of the Golden Hair (1903) by William Harvey P\u00e9lissier, Eithne (1909) by Robert O'Dwyer, and The Tinker and the Fairy (1910) by Michele Esposito. Muirgheis and Eithne have librettos in Irish, as have a number of 1940s and '50s works by \u00c9amonn \u00d3 Gallchobhair. Most of the Irish operas written since the 1960s have a contemporary international outlook, with important works by Gerard Victory, James Wilson, Raymond Deane, Gerald Barry, and a number of young composers since the turn of the century."]}, {"page": "James Wilson", "response": ["James Wilson may refer to:", "*James Wilson (Upper Canada politician) (1770\u20131847), English-born farmer and
