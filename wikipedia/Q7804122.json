When his father moved back to the UK to work for the BBC, Tim went to Datchworth primary school. Later his father ran The Near East Broadcasting Station Sharq al-Adna; his mother taught her children by PNEU until Tim went to The Junior School in Nicosia as a boarder. After the Suez d\u00e9b\u00e2cle, his father returned to the UK to train as a parson, and the family lived in Oxfordshire, Wiltshire and Dorset. Tim boarded at the Perse school to age 15 and then to Dauntsey's.  From 1964 to 1967 he was an undergraduate at the University of Hull, obtaining a 1st Class BSc. (Special Honours) in Mathematics. In 1967-1969 he began graduate work at Hull, taking a sabbatical year as Student Union president. He then moved to the University of Warwick to take a PhD in mathematics.\nHis PhD thesis on \" Fuzzy Geometry\" was supervised by  Christopher Zeeman and the PhD was awarded in 1972.  This topic, otherwise known as \"tolerance spaces\", is similar to topology and should not be confused with fuzzy logic.\nTim specialized in geometry, graphics, algorithm design, human-computer interaction, medical imaging, patent writing and singularity theory. His books on catastrophe theory and on differential geometry and relativity are still in print after a third of a century.\nHis academic career was carried out in a series of research centres, including Rio de Janeiro, Rochester NY, Porto, Geneva, Stuttgart, Charleston SC, Santa Cruz CA, Los Angeles CA, Pohang, Singapore, and Bangalore.  His academic publications include 70 papers in journals and conference proceedings and 4 research texts.\nHis research areas include catastrophe theory, the psychology of perception, vibrations of crystals, urban planning, settlement patterns in archaeology, 3D graphics, magnetic resonance imaging, interaction with documents and with virtual 3D objects, dynamic text rendering, and brain surgery planning. He has 18 patents issued, with another 12 in the pipeline.\nFrom a very early age Tim discovered he not only liked to read science fiction, but loved writing down his own stories too. This ultimately led to the co-authoring of an SF novel The Living Labyrinth, published in 2016 by ReAnimus Press, and its sequel Rock Star in 2017.\nLess well known is his role as active founding member of COUM Transmissions performance group with Genesis P-Orridge. They studied at Hull University together. Tim Poston wrote texts and advised COUM on physics and mathematics 1968\u20131978. Tim Poston remained \"Scientific Adviser\" to P-Orridge up until his death in 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Genesis P-Orridge", "response": ["On 5 January 1971, P-Orridge underwent a legal name change to Genesis P-Orridge by deed poll, combining the adopted nickname Genesis with an altered spelling of porridge, the foodstuff which they had lived off as a student. The new name was intentionally un-glamorous, and they hoped that it would trigger a personal \"genius factor\". In February, COUM caught the attention of The Yorkshire Post, which featured an article on them that led to further media attention from national newspapers. They also featured in an article in Torch, the publication of the University of Hull's student union, entitled \"God Sucks Mary's Hairy Nipple\"; the article's author, Haydn Robb (nowadays known as Haydn Nobb), subsequently joined COUM, as did maths lecturer Tim Poston. In April 1971, COUM, consisting of P'Orridge and Gasmantell, broadcast their first live radio session, for the On Cue programme for Radio Humberside. Following up the press attention they received, they performed further happenings, including their first street action, Absolute Everywhere, which brought problems with the police."]}, {"page": "COUM Transmissions", "response": ["COUM Transmissions was a music and performance art collective who operated in the United Kingdom from 1969 through to 1976. The collective was influenced by the Dada and surrealism artistic movements, the writers of the Beat Generation, and underground music. COUM were openly confrontational and subversive, challenging aspects of conventional British society. Founded in Hull, Yorkshire by Genesis P-Orridge, other prominent early members included Cosey Fanni Tutti and Spydeee Gasmantell (also at school with Genesis P-Orridge). Part-time members included Tim Poston, \"Brook\" Menzies, Haydn Robb, Les Maull (aka The Reverend Lelli), Ray Harvey, John Smith, Foxtrot Echo, Fizzy Paet and John Gunni Busck (John Lacey). Later members included Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson and Chris Carter, who together with P-Orridge and Fanni Tutti went on to found the pioneering industrial band Throbbing Gristle in 1976.", "Underneath L to R Tim Poston, Spydeee Gasmantell, Genesis, Haydn Robb, John Smith, Menzies.", "The Gondola Club was raided by the police and closed down soon after; most other local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them from performing in the Hull area. COUM drew up a petition which they distributed locally to gain support for the group and as a result, the group got a booking at the local Brickhouse, which was their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. However, the petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and fellow COUM member Haydn Robb (now known as Haydn Nobb) of publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped.. Gaining coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they were asked to support the rock band Hawkwind at St. George's Hall in Bradford in October 1971, where they performed a piece called Edna and the Great Surfers, where they led the crowd in shouting \"Off, Off, Off\". The following month, the band attracted the interest of John Peel, who discussed the band in Disco and Music Echo, remarking that \"[s]ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces me to believe that we need more madmen like them.\". They also featured in an article in Torch, the publication of the University of Hull's student union, entitled \"God Sucks Mary's Hairy Nipple\"; a title from a message received during a seance in Solihull attended by P'Orridge, Gasmantell and others in 1967. The author of the article, Haydn Robb, would subsequently join the performance collective.

Engineer.' \u2018Engineer\u2019 in its first edition in 2005 was born out of the amalgamation of three smaller scale technical symposia held until then. Engineer 2006 was planned on a larger scale, with innovative events including paper presentations, Shrishti, where participants are required to apply engineering for the greater good of society, robotics events (Perfect Machine, Automata), hacking contests, programming contests, electronics design events, and workshops. Socially conscious engineering has been a recurring theme. Guest speakers at Video conferences include Richard Stallman, Bjarne Stroustrup, Sam Pitroda, Dr. Devi Shetty, Sir Anthony James Leggett, Kevin Warwick, and Tim Poston. Engineer 2010 was dubbed the 'Golden Edition' due to it coinciding with the Golden Jubilee year celebrations. NITK hosted its first TEDx conference during Engineer 2011, and many influential speakers of the region were invited to talk on socially relevant issues. From the year 2018, Engineer has also hosted its annual NITK Model United Nations conference where the committees focus on various pressing issues around the globe and have a committee which focuses on the theme of the fest."]}, {"page": "Poston", "response": ["*Tim Poston (1945\u20132017), British mathematician"]}, {"page": "Tim poston", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tim Poston "]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2017", "response": ["*Tim Poston, 72, English mathematician.Tim Poston obituary"]}, {"page": "Timothy Poston", "response": ["#redirect Tim Poston"]}]}}
