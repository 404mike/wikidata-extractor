They influence the way music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to Heaven,' having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits.

Active for almost six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, heavier-driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up comprised vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.", "In May 1963, the Rolling Stones signed Andrew Loog Oldham as their manager. His previous clients, the Beatles, directed the former publicist to the band. Because Oldham was only nineteen and had not reached the age of majority\u2014he was also younger than anyone in the band\u2014he could not obtain an agent's licence or sign any contracts without his mother co-signing. By necessity he joined with booking agent Eric Easton to secure record financing and assistance booking venues. Gomelsky, who had no written agreement with the band, was not consulted. Initially, Oldham tried applying the strategy used by Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, and have the band members wear suits. He later changed his mind and imagined a band that contrasted with the Beatles, featuring unmatched clothing, long hair, and an unclean appearance. He wanted to make the Stones \"a raunchy, gamy, unpredictable bunch of undesirables\" and to \"establish that the Stones were threatening, uncouth and animalistic\". Stewart left the official line-up, but remained road manager and touring keyboardist. Of Stewart's decision, Oldham later said, \"Well, he just doesn't look the part, and six is too many for [fans] to remember the faces in the picture.\" Later, Oldham reduced the band members' ages in publicity material to make them appear as teenagers."]}, {"page": "Soho", "response": ["The 2i's Coffee Bar was one of the first rock clubs in Europe.

One of these words was hep which described someone in the know. When lots of people started using hep, musicians changed to hip. I started calling people hipsters and greeted customers who dug the kind of jazz we were playing as 'all you hipsters.'

The group played songs by American rhythm and blues artists like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, but strongly encouraged by manager Andrew Loog Oldham, Jagger and Richards soon began to write songs. Their songwriting partnership took some time to develop; one of their early compositions was \"As Tears Go By\", a song written for Marianne Faithfull, a young singer Loog Oldham was promoting.
