Gunn had been bought as a replacement for England international goalkeeper Chris Woods, who had moved to Rangers F.C. Meanwhile, reserve team keeper Graham Benstead made a series of good performances and Norwich were top of the league. Ken Brown wanted to be fair to Benstead and made Gunn wait. A 6\u20132 defeat at Anfield proved to be the catalyst for Gunn's promotion to the first team. He made his debut in a Full Members Cup win against Coventry City, conceding a penalty, and made his league debut in a 2\u20131 victory against Tottenham Hotspur at Carrow Road on 8 November 1986."]}, {"page": "West London derby", "response": ["* Graham Benstead \u2013 first QPR, then Brentford."]}, {"page": "List of people from Aldershot", "response": ["* Graham Benstead - footballer "]}, {"page": "Graham Westley", "response": ["When Westley took over the Hertfordshire club, Stevenage were positioned in 21st place in the Football Conference, and were six points adrift of safety. Unlike his position at his previous club, Westley was appointed as first team manager, with no board involvement. With an initial objective of keeping the club in the highest tier in non-League football, he signed seven players from his previous club Farnborough, as well as his former assistant Graham Pearce and goalkeeping coach Graham Benstead. His first game as manager of the club was a 1\u20131 draw at home to Morecambe on 13 February 2003, before waiting three games for his first win, a 2\u20130 victory away at local rivals Barnet on 8 March 2003. The victory served as the catalyst for an eight-game unbeaten run, recording six consecutive victories to ensure the club avoided relegation. Westley guided the club from 21st in the table to a 12th-place finish by the end of the season. Stevenage finished in eighth place during the 2003\u201304 season, Westley's first full season."]}]}}
