For example, the journals of Oswald Walters Brierly describe a journey he made from Twofold Bay in 1842 along a traditional route through the mountains under the guidance of an Aboriginal man, Budgibro. The journal includes notes and drawings of the journey and the route taken. A surveyor, Francis McCabe, made a survey of the route between the Monaro and Twofold Bay in 1945. The Chief Protector of Aborigines, George Augustus Robinson, recorded the story of Al.mil.gong who walked all the way from Omeo to present his new corroboree to his kin at Bilgalera on Twofold Bay on 14 August 1844.
