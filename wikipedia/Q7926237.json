Corrigan, who was openly hostile to the social democratic AD government. Victor Perowne of the American Department of the Foreign Office wrote: \"Oglive-Forbes has reported consistently favorably on the Revolutionary Government and harshly on its predecessors. There is some room for doubt whether these views do not require some qualification, at any rate they are not those of the U.S. ambassador, a  man with a far wider and deeper experience of Venezuela than Oglivie-Forbes\". In response, Oglive-Forbes reported the deposed Medina Angarita government had been \"notoriously supine in its attitude towards the interests of German firms established in Venezuela\". Perowne wrote on the margin of Oglivie-Forbes's dispatch: \"Our and (Corrigan's) experience in Venezuela is longer than that of Oglivie-Forbes who has shown himself a envout\u00e9 of the charms of the present government-one of least, of whose members made a most unfavorable impression in London, barely a year ago\". In June 1946, one of the oil companies operating in Venezuela, the Royal Dutch Shell company, requested that Ogilvie-Forbes have a warship sent to Venezuelan waters for \"its calming effect on the European staff\", a request that was refused."]}, {"page": "Perowne, Victor", "response": ["#redirectVictor Perowne"]}]}}
