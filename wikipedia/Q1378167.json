A great-grandson of John Veitch, the founder of the Veitch horticulture dynasty, he also visited the Philippines, Australia, Fiji, and other Polynesian islands.\nHe brought back a number of the glasshouse plants in vogue at the time, such as Acalyphas, Cordylines, Codiaeums (Crotons) and Dracaenas, and, from Fiji, a palm of a new genus later named after him, Veitchia joannis. The Veitch family name is honoured by hundreds of plant names, including the genus Veitchia. The Veitch nursery introduced 232 orchids, some 500 greenhouse plants, 118 exotic ferns, about 50 conifers, 153 deciduous trees, 72 evergreen and climbing shrubs, 122 herbaceous and 37 bulbous plants from various corners of the globe.In Japan, he came across the eminent plant collector Robert Fortune, and their competing collections returned to England on the same ship. For example, both men claimed discovery of a species of Chamaecyparis pisifera.\nHe was married to Jane Hodge soon after his return to England in 1866 and fathered two sons,  James Herbert Veitch  (1868 \u2013 1907) and John Gould Veitch, Jr. (1869 \u2013 1914) before dying of tuberculosis at the age of 31.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*John Gould Veitch"]}, {"page": "Sciadopitys", "response": ["The plant was first introduced to the UK by John Gould Veitch in September 1860.

James Bateman noted the following: \"Prof. Reichenbach being anxious to connect in some way the name of Mr John G. Veitch with that of a plant which forms one of his more remarkable discoveries, and being unable to call it Dendrobium Veitchianum because that name had long since been given by Dr. Lindley to another species of the genus discovered by Lobb, hit upon the ingenious device of making his Christian name the passport to immortality in the present instance. Certainly no one ever laboured harder in the cause of science or deserved the compliment better than the adventurous young traveller, who has already added so many new things to our collections, and who, we sincerely hope, may be spared to enrich them still more."]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (T\u2013V)", "response": ["* Veitch \u2013 John Gould Veitch (1839\u20131870)"]}]}}
