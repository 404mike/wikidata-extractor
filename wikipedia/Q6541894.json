There, the Arabs who formed his support base were distributed throughout the countryside and were dominated by a single confederation, the Quda'a. This was in contrast to Iraq and Egypt, where the diverse tribal composition of the garrison towns meant that the government had no cohesive support base and had to create a delicate balance between the opposing tribal groups. As evidenced by the disintegration of Ali's Iraqi alliance, maintaining this balance was untenable. In her view, Mu'awiya's taking advantage of the tribal circumstances in Syria prevented the dissolution of the Caliphate in the civil war. In the words of the orientalist Martin Hinds, the success of Mu'awiya's style of governance is \"attested by the fact that he managed to hold his kingdom together without ever having to resort to using his Syrian troops\"."]}, {"page": "Kharijites", "response": ["M. A. Shaban and Martin Hinds see socio-economic factors at the root of Kharijite rebellions. Rejecting the notion that the  were the Qur'an readers, Shaban holds that they were villagers who had gained status in Iraq during the caliphate of Umar for their loyalty to the state during the wars of apostasy and were thus awarded the trusteeship of the fertile lands of Iraq. They were dissatisfied with the economic policies of Uthman and saw Ali's caliphate as a means of restoring their status. When he agreed to talks with Mu'awiya they felt their status threatened and consequently rebelled. According to him, the main role in forcing Ali to accept the arbitration was not of the  but of the tribal chiefs, as the latter group had benefited from the policies of Uthman. They were not enthusiastic supporters of Ali and considered the prospect of continued war not in their interests. The Kharijite rebellions after the Siffin event were also of economic origins. In Hinds' view, the status of the  was based on Umar's principle of  (early conversion to Islam) and their participation in the early conquests. They hoped that Ali would continue Umar's system and only for that reason threw their lot with him. They supported the arbitration because they assumed it would bring an end to the war but Ali would remain caliph and would return to Medina, leaving the administration of Iraq in the hands of the local population including themselves. They denounced it once they discovered that Ali was not recognized as caliph in the document and that the arbiters could also use their own judgment in addition to the Qur'anic principles."]}, {"page": "Al-Tabari", "response": ["Moshe Pearlman, Ismail Poonawala, Fred Donner, Hugh N.

According to the historian Martin Hinds, the \"extent of the power and influence of Makhzum in Mecca during the 6th century A.D. cannot be established with any certainty\". Based on the traditional Arabic sources, they formed part of the Ahlaf (\"allies\") faction of the Quraysh alongside the clans of Abd al-Dar, Banu Sahm, Banu Jumah and Banu Adi, in rivalry to the clans of the Banu Hashim and Banu Abd Shams. Toward the end of the 6th century, a scion of the Makhzum, Hisham ibn al-Mughira, grew to such prominence in Mecca that the Quraysh established a dating system that began with his death. His family, the Banu Hisham, thenceforth became the leading house of the Mughira line of the Makhzum. At the time, Hisham, his brothers al-Walid, Hashim and Abu Umayya and a number of their sons dominated Meccan trade with Yemen and Ethiopia.Hinds, pp. 137\u2013138."]}, {"page": "Suliman Bashear", "response": ["Like the work of Patricia Crone, Michael Cook, John Wansbrough, Yehuda D.
