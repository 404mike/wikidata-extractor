A right-handed batsman and right-arm seam bowler, Hutton's bowling was probably his stronger discipline, but he was considered an all-rounder.  He played first-class cricket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club.  He is the son of cricketer Len Hutton, described by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as \"one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 6", "response": ["*  1942   \u2013 Richard Hutton, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["Boycott captained Yorkshire for eight seasons from 1971 to 1978, having been appointed following the sacking of Brian Close in 1970. Despite well publicised conflict between the two players, Boycott recorded in 1987 that he regretted Close's removal from the club, and wrote him a letter in admiration for his contributions to Yorkshire.Boycott, p. 146. To captain Yorkshire had been one of Boycott's aims since he started county cricket in 1962.McKinstry, p. 121. Yorkshire's scorer Ted Lester commented later that Boycott \"never got the support he deserved from the committee. After the captaincy was decided on a casting vote, the half that didn't want him never wanted him.\"McKinstry, p. 120. Some members of the committee wanted to remove him almost immediately. He also caused strife between his fellow players, including a reciprocated dislike for Richard Hutton,Boycott, p. 196-171. with many players leaving the club citing personal differences with Boycott as the reason for their departure.McKinstry, p. 141.", "Boycott headed the national batting averages in 1972 with 72.35, and was second in 1973 with 63.62. In 1973, however, Yorkshire failed to win any of the 8 championship games with Boycott in charge, and Wisden called the season \"disturbingly unsuccessful\".  It led to further calls for Boycott to be stripped of the captaincy. He was also coming into increased conflict with Richard Hutton, Close, and several members of the committee and senior players.McKinstry, p. 128.Boycott, p. 169. \"Looking back,\" Boycott wrote in 1987 \"I wish I had given up the Yorkshire captaincy at the end of that year.\"Boycott, p. 175.", "Boycott's playing style revolved around intense concentration, solid defence and attention to detail, while avoiding heavy hitting or slogging.McKinstry, p. 24. He was described in The Complete Encyclopaedia of Cricket as \"one of the greatest opening batsmen that the game has known. He dedicated his life to the art of batting, practising assiduously and eschewing any shot that might even hint at threatening the loss of his wicket.\" Through his Test career, he scored 15.4% of England's runs, and England won 32.41% of the Tests in which Boycott played. This compares with England's 34.76% victory rate over all Test cricket history. Richard Hutton, Yorkshire and England batsman and son of Len Hutton, described Boycott as a \"one-pace player\", suggesting that he was unable to alter his playing pace as the match circumstances dictated.McKinstry, p. 114. Nevertheless, Boycott maintained an \"impeccable\" defensive technique, and possessed a temperament ideally suited for five-day Test matches.McKinstry, p. 51. Arlott wrote that \"his technique is based on a defence organised as near flawlessness as may be.\"Arlott, p. 127. Boycott himself remarked, in 1981, that: \"Given the choice between Raquel Welch and a hundred at Lord's, I'd take the hundred every time.\" His careful batting is reflected in his 22 centuries for England, of which only two had a strike rate of over 51.00. Former England bowler Frank Tyson wrote in 1987, in The Test Within, that \"the greatness of Boycott the batsman and the gaffes of Boycott the man had common roots in an unceasing quest after perfection.\" Boycott also kept a black book which he used to record bowlers' tendencies."]}, {"page": "Repton School", "response": ["*Richard Hutton, Donald Carr and Chris Adams, cricketers"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Richard Hutton", "| Richard Hutton"]}, {"page": "List of International cricket families", "response": ["*Richard Hutton"]}, {"page": "Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970", "response": ["Another scheduled South African tour, this time to Australia, was cancelled in 1971 and the Rest of the World team was recreated, again under the captaincy of Gary Sobers.

In 1980 in his autobiography, Time to Declare, D'Oliveira wrote that Johnson scored a useful 27 runs to help D'Oliveira to 227, his highest score in first-class cricket. The Yorkshire bowler Richard Hutton, grew increasingly frustrated with Johnson, who was making streaky shots through the slips and gully area off Hutton's medium-pace bowling. Finally, when Johnson thick-edged a ball for four, Hutton told Johnson, \"Why don't you (expletive) off back onto the Robertson's jam jar, you Golliwog.\" Everybody, including Johnson, fell about laughing. Hutton meant that Johnson's high afro hair-style resembled the Golliwog trademark on the Robertson's jam jar labels.
