There is anecdotal evidence, related to biographer George Wyatt by her former lady-in-waiting Anne Gainsford,Fraser, p.145. that Anne brought to Henry's attention a heretical pamphlet, perhaps Tyndale's The Obedience of a Christian Man or one by Simon Fish called A Supplication for the Beggars, which cried out to monarchs to rein in the evil excesses of the Catholic Church. She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church, and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures. According to Maria Dowling, \"Anne tried to educate her waiting-women in scriptural piety\" and is believed to have reproved her cousin, Mary Shelton, for \"having 'idle poesies' written in her prayer book.\"Dowling 1986, 232. If Cavendish is to be believed, Anne's outrage at Wolsey may have personalised whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France. Further, the most recent edition of Ives's biography admits that Anne may very well have had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth that spurred her on, not just as catalyst but expediter for Henry's Reformation, though the process took years."]}, {"page": "Robert Wakefield", "response": ["He studied at the University of Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1513-1514.

He signed the articles drawn up in 1536. He shared in composing the Institution of the Christian Man, and supported the translation of the Bible. He vainly tried to substitute a milder policy for the Six Articles of 1539. Extreme Erastianism, which maintained that simple appointment by the monarch was enough, without episcopal consecration, to constitute a lawful bishop, he shared with Thomas Cranmer. But the other opinions he maintained\u2014that confession was not enjoined by Scripture; that there were just three sacraments; that laymen were as competent to excommunicate heretics as bishops or priests; that purgatory was a delusion\u2014were extreme and incautious for the end of Henry VIII's reign. At this period he was one of Cranmer's few close allies on the evangelical wing of the bishops: they two with Hugh Latimer were the main clerical supporters of humanist education, and with Thomas Goodrich were the most advanced reformers on some matters of doctrine.Maria Dowling, Humanism in the Age of Henry VIII (1986), p. 131.Diarmaid MacCulloch, Thomas Cranmer: A Life (1996), p. 294.

It had already passed a number of small, but significant acts, both against perceived social ills\u2014such as vagabondage\u2014and the church, for example restricting recourse to praemunire and the right of sanctuary. The ambassador from the Holy Roman Empire, Eustace Chapuys wrote to his master, the Emperor Charles V, that Fisher was unpopular with the King prior to the deaths, and reported that parties unnamed but close to the king had threatened to throw Fisher and his followers into the River Thames if he continued his opposition. The historian G. W. Bernard has speculated that Fisher may have been \"a target of intimidation\", and notes that there were two suggestive incidents during this period. The atmosphere of suspicion at court, and the passion with which Fisher defended Katherine of Aragon angered both King Henry and Anne Boleyn; for her part, Chapuys later reported, she \"feared no-one in England more than Fisher, because he had always defended the queen without respect of persons\". Around this time, Anne advised Fisher not to attend parliament\u2014where he was expected to speak passionately against the King and his mistress\u2014\"in case [Fisher] caught some disease as he had before\". Dowling classes this as a threat, albeit a veiled one. In the event, Fisher ignored both Anne and the advice and attended parliament as intended. Attempts had been made to persuade Fisher by force of argument\u2014the most recent had been the previous June in a disputation between Fisher and John Stokesley, Bishop of London but nothing had come of it. Rex suggests that \"the failure of this move led some to consider more decisive solutions\"; the Tudor historian Maria Dowling that \"Fisher's enemies soon went beyond mere bluster\"."]}, {"page": "Dowling, Maria", "response": ["#redirectMaria Dowling"]}]}}
