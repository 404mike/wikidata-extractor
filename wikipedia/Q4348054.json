The firing had commenced in response to a member of the crowd firing an RPG-7, which was later preposterously claimed to have been an accidental discharge. As the former Vityaz member Gennadi Ternovskii recounted in his memoir 'The Crimson Beret' it is virtually impossible to fire an RPG-7 accidentally, and the members of the Vityaz unit had opened fire in accordance with the laws in force at that time regarding the use of deadly force.
