Between 1973 and 1981 he photographed mundane aspects of middle class life in the centre of England\u2014black and white portraits of ordinary people and suburbia within walking distance of his home in Stourbridge.\nMyers self-published this photography in books in 1974 and 1990; then only after renewed critical attention in 2011 were more books dedicated solely to his photography published. His work was included in the international survey of photographers, The Photography Book (Phaidon Press, 2014). Since the early 1970s he has exhibited in the UK and Europe. His work is held in the collection of the Library of Birmingham, in the Arts Council Collection, and in the James Hyman Collection.\nHe later gave up photography for painting and had a solo exhibition in 2003 at Rugby Art Gallery and Museum.\nMyers worked as a lecturer in fine art, then painting, from 1969 to 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doc Edgerton", "response": ["*Seeing the Unseen: The High Speed Photography of Dr. Harold Edgerton, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, January 1976; then toured to The Photographers' Gallery, London; Hatton Gallery, Newcastle University; Midland Group Gallery, Nottingham; Modern Art Oxford; and Arnolfini, Bristol.
