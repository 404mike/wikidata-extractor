Writing in Wisden, E. M. Wellings described him as a commendable stroke-maker who played \"positive, aggressive cricket\". He went up to Hertford College, Oxford, and played two matches for Oxford University in 1962 and 10 in 1963, when he was awarded his blue.\nHis highest score in first-class cricket was 56 against Surrey in 1963. His best bowling return with his leg-spin was 4 for 56 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), also in 1963. Earlier in the season he had helped Oxford achieve their first first-class victory for two years when he made 50 not out and 42 and took 3 for 18 in the second innings against Nottinghamshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sabine, Peter", "response": ["#redirectPeter Sabine"]}]}}
