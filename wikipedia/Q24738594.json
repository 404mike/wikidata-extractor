The production repurposed the original set designs by Derek McLane, sound design by Simon Baker, lighting design by Neil Austin, and musical supervision/direction by Stephen Ridley. Foster and Kendal departed the production in October 2021 and were succeeded by Rachel York and Haydn Gwynne, respectively, who appeared in the production until it closed in November.

Kenneth Tynan railed against the 'gratuitous obscurity' of Harold Pinter's poetic 1975 play when it was first produced by Peter Hall at the National starring John Gielgud as the supplicant versifier Spooner and Ralph Richardson as his host Hirst, patron and supporter of the arts. But the play is always gloriously enjoyable as an off-kilter vaudeville of friendship and dependency.\" In The Guardian, Billington concludes that \"This is a compelling revival much aided by Neil Austin's lighting and Adam Cork's subliminal sound,\" observing: \"when audience and cast finally joined in applauding Pinter, [who was] seated in a box, I felt it was in recognition of an eerily disturbing play that transports us into a world somewhere between reality and dream.\""]}, {"page": "Tony Award for Best Lighting Design", "response": ["|Neil Austin", "|Neil Austin", "|Neil Austin", "|Neil Austin", "* Neil Austin", "* Neil Austin"]}, {"page": "Rosmersholm", "response": ["|Neil Austin"]}, {"page": "List of lighting designers", "response": ["*Neil Austin"]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Finn", "response": ["*Company, a 1970 musical comedy with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by George Furth.
