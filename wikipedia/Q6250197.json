An editorial board comprised leading scholars, most notably Sir John Neale and Sir Lewis Namier. Years of energetic research demonstrated a commitment to the new technique of \"prosopography\", or quantitative collective biography. However, Neale and Namier had sharply different interpretations of the project. Neale looked for definitive quantitative answers to specific technical questions, of the sort suggested by his traditional whiggish view of constitutional development. Namier, on the other hand, took a sociological approach to use the lives of MPs as an entry point to recreate the world of the governing classes. The editorial board was unable to synthesize the two approaches. Namier's team moved faster through the documents, so much of the work followed his model. The Conservative government entered the debate, led by Harold Macmillan and civil servants who wanted a finished product rather than a never-ending project. Namier's ambition was curtailed and, after his death in 1960, his own section was completed by his assistant, John Brooke, in a more restricted format."]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John Neale, 93, English Anglican clergyman, Bishop of Ramsbury (1974\u20131988)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2020", "response": ["*John Neale, 93, English Anglican clergyman, Bishop of Ramsbury (1974\u20131988).Bishop John Neale RIP"]}]}}
