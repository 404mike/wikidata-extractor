As well as being an immense physical task, it was also an extremely complex mathematical undertaking. MacLeod can fairly be said to be the creator of the Ordnance Survey in its modern form.\nMacLeod was commissioned in the Royal Engineers in 1900, serving in India from 1902 until 1914. During World War I he commanded the 4th Field Survey Battalion and was awarded the MC in the 1917 New Year Honours. He became Chief Instructor at the School of Artillery, Larkhill in 1920, serving until 1923 when he moved to the Ordnance Survey. He was Director-General of the Ordnance Survey in 1935, retiring in 1943.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malcolm Neynoe MacLeod", "response": ["#REDIRECT Malcolm MacLeod (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Malcolm MacLeod", "response": ["Malcolm MacLeod may refer to:", "*Malcolm MacLeod (clan chief), Scottish clan chief", "*Malcolm MacLeod (British Army officer) (1882\u20131969), British scientist and Director General of the Ordnance Survey from 1935 to 1943.
