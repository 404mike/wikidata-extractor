Wagstaff worked as a translator and interpreter in the German language before turning to music as a profession in the late 1990s. His interest in language and political history continues to be reflected in much of his music and in his theatre libretti.\nHe came to public attention with the musical John Paul Jones (2001), based on the life of the Scots-born sailor and hero of the American Revolution. Premiered in Edinburgh in 2001, this was the first of the composer's works to reach a significant audience. In it, Wagstaff's eclectic compositional style (which frequently involves the integration of several different styles within one work) began to emerge. John Paul Jones was revived as a concert version in 2010 in association with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.The composer began to study musical composition at the University of Edinburgh with Professor Nigel Osborne in 2001, earning a master's degree in music in 2002 and a PhD in 2008.\nWagstaff's specific interest in German history, particularly the history of the former German Democratic Republic, is reflected in Treptow for string orchestra (2005), his most-performed work. This piece, which won the 2005 Emre Araci Prize, was inspired by the Soviet War Memorial in Treptow Park in east Berlin.\nIn August 2007, Wagstaff presented his hour-long chamber opera The Turing Test on the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The opera takes its name from the test proposed by the English mathematician Alan Turing for human level intelligence in a machine. A recording of his Piano Quintet was released in the same year on an album by the Edinburgh Quartet recorded by Calum Malcolm entitled Frontiers and Bridges.In 2011, Wagstaff was commissioned by the Royal Society of Chemistry to compose a new work to celebrate International Year of Chemistry 2011. The trio for clarinet, cello and piano is entitled A Persistent Illusion and was premiered by Hebrides Ensemble on 12 December 2011.In 2013, the composer was commissioned by the University of Edinburgh to write and produce a short opera to celebrate the Tercentenary of its School of Chemistry which fell that year. The resulting work, entitled Breathe Freely, is set during the Second World War and premiered in the Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh) on 24 October 2013 in a production supported by Scottish Opera. A CD recording of the opera was released on the Linn Records label in October 2015.Wagstaff lives and works in his native city. His works are widely performed throughout Scotland and beyond.\nWagstaff writes and performs rock music under the name Jules Reed. His cousin is the writer Rich Johnston.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Julian Wagstaff (born 1970)"]}, {"page": "Piano quintet", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff"]}, {"page": "String trio", "response": ["| Julian Wagstaff (born 1970) || In Extremis (2011)()"]}, {"page": "String orchestra", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff: Treptow for String Orchestra (2005)"]}, {"page": "List of musicals: A to L", "response": ["| Julian Wagstaff", "| Julian Wagstaff", "| Julian Wagstaff and Joel Jenkins"]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Julian Wagstaff || 1970 ||  || Scottish ||The Turing Test (chamber opera), Breathe Freely (chamber opera) || "]}, {"page": "2001 in British music", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff \u2013 John Paul JonesThe Scotsman, 11 July 2001"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff, contemporary classical composer"]}, {"page": "List of operas by composer", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff (1970\u2013 ): The Turing Test (opera), Breathe Freely (opera)"]}, {"page": "Wagstaff", "response": ["* Julian Wagstaff (born 1970), Scottish music composer"]}, {"page": "John Paul Jones (disambiguation)", "response": ["* John Paul Jones, a 2001 musical about the naval commander by Scottish composer Julian Wagstaff"]}, {"page": "List of symphony composers", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff (born 1970), Scottish composer of Symphony for Chamber Orchestra"]}, {"page": "Piano trio repertoire", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff"]}, {"page": "Clarinet-cello-piano trio", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff (b. 1970)"]}, {"page": "Turing test (disambiguation)", "response": ["* The Turing Test, a chamber opera composed by Julian Wagstaff in 2017"]}, {"page": "2007 in British music", "response": ["*Julian Wagstaff \u2013 The Turing Test (premi\u00e8red 15 August)Rowena Smith, Review: The Turing Test, The Guardian, 16 August 2007.
