Upon seeing the success of Plus 8 Records in early 1990, they were inspired to do the same, and in 1991 founded B12 Records as an outlet for the music they and their friends Kirk Degiorgio (a.k.a. As One), and Steve Pickton (a.k.a. Stasis), were producing. Writing under various monikers they released a series of 12\" vinyl records, each with a limited run of coloured vinyl, and messages hand-etched into the run-out grooves."]}, {"page": "Pickton", "response": ["* Steve Pickton, British electronic-techno musician, producer and sound engineer"]}, {"page": "Stasis (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steve Pickton"]}, {"page": "Pickton, Steve", "response": ["#redirectSteve Pickton"]}]}}
