He then featured as a 16-year-old in Dunfermline's famous 6-2 home victory against Valencia in 1962. He then went on to play for Dunfermline in the Scottish Cup Finals of 1965 and 1968, winning the latter.\nHibernian manager Eddie Turnbull signed Edwards for \u00a313,000 in 1971. He combined well on the right side of the Hibs side with John Brownlie. He played in another Scottish Cup Final in 1972, before winning the Scottish League Cup in the following season. Hibs challenged for the league title that season as well, but fell away after Edwards was banned for eight weeks having been booked four times.\nEdwards moved on to Arbroath in 1978, before retiring from professional football in 1980.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Edwards", "response": ["Alex Edwards (born 2 August 1975) was an English cricketer.

As the club's bank threatened closure, Wright was forced to sell his three most effective attacking players \u2013 Alex Edwards, Joe McBride and Pat Gardner \u2013 and field a team largely formed from his previous two seasons' youth squads. In addition, influential senior players Bert Paton and John Lunn were lost to serious injury and illness.
