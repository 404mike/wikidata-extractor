He was firstly the suffragan Bishop of Stepney (one of five Episcopal Areas of the Diocese of London in the Church of England since the 1979 creation of the London area scheme) from 1978 to 1991 and later the diocesan Bishop of Bath & Wells in succession to George Carey who had become Archbishop of Canterbury.  He retired in 2001.\nThompson was probably best known to many as a regular contributor to the \"Thought for the Day\" segment on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  Following his death in 2003, obituaries in the national press praised his deep humanity and lively sense of humour. One obituary referred to his gift of \"conveying the warmth of his physical presence in his voice and in his words\", adding that \"his reflection on the events of 11 September 2001 was nominated for a Sony Broadcast Award, uniquely for religious broadcasting.\" He used his seat in the House of Lords to express his concerns for equality and education. The Telegraph described him as \"the Church of England's best known commentator on social and political matters as well as a prominent advocate of religious and racial tolerance.\" Thompson wrote that \"a bishop who doesn't give offence to anyone is probably not a good bishop.\" Thompson was also an important figure in interfaith relations in Britain, chairing the British Council of Churches advisory committee and co-chairing the Interfaith Network for the United Kingdom.  He believed that when Christians helped to create opportunities for all faiths to participate in public and in institutional life (such as in educational and health care chaplaincy) they were being good neighbours in a multi-faith world.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Thompson", "response": ["* Jim Thompson (writer) (1906\u20131977), American author and screenwriter, known for his pulp crime fiction", "* Jim Thompson (designer) (1906\u2013disappeared 1967), revived the Thai silk industry", "* James R.

This laid a large portion of the blame for the social issues on the policies of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. A number of Anglican bishops appeared on Thought for the Day speaking out against Thatcher's social policies including Tom Butler, Jim Thompson and Richard Harries. To protect against accusations of bias in the run-up to the 1987 General Election, David Hatch told producers: \"I don't want some lefty bishop on Thought for the Day queering our pitch\"."]}, {"page": "Appointment of Church of England bishops", "response": ["The commission meets several times in secret. The commission then forwards two names to the prime minister, who chooses one of them, or (exceptionally) requests additional names from the commission. In recent memory, the only prime minister who has not accepted the commission's preferred candidate was Margaret Thatcher, who opposed Jim Thompson\u2019s nomination as Bishop of Birmingham, due to his (perceived) liberal and left-leaning views.  Since 2007 the convention has been that the prime minister will choose the first-named recommendation. If the chosen individual accepts the office, the prime minister advises the Sovereign, who then formally nominates the prime minister's choice. Thereafter, the diocese's College of Canons meets to 'elect' the new bishop.  (This stage of the process was mocked by Ralph Waldo Emerson thus: \"The King sends the Dean and Canons a cong\u00e9 d'\u00e9lire, or leave to elect, but also sends them the name of the person whom they are to elect. They go into the Cathedral, chant and pray; and after these invocations invariably find that the dictates of the Holy Ghost agree with the recommendation of the King\" [Emerson, English Traits, XIII, 1856].)"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Stepney", "response": ["| 60px Jim Thompson"]}, {"page": "West Hatch", "response": ["The parish Church of St Andrew dates from the 15th century, but was extensively restored in 1861 when the north aisle and probably the vestry and organ bay were added by Benjamin Ferrey.
