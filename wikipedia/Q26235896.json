In a long career, he was cast in a variety of roles, but frequently in 'foreigner' roles, and often as policemen. Indeed, his most remembered role is probably that of Colonel Latignant in the 1960s ITC series The Saint with Roger Moore. The character of Latignant was one of the few recurring characters in the series' long run.Towards the end of his career he appeared in the BBC comedy series In Sickness and in Health as Mr Rabinsky, Alf Garnett's Jewish tight neighbour with a black hat and long beard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Georges Clemenceau", "response": ["Arnold Diamond portrayed Georges Clemenceau in A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia (1992)"]}, {"page": "In Sickness and in Health", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Mr Rabinsky (Series 1\u20134)"]}, {"page": "1992 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 18 || Arnold Diamond || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 76 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "1977 in film", "response": ["| March or Die || Columbia Pictures / ITC Entertainment || Dick Richards (director); David Zelag Goodman (screenplay); Gene Hackman, Terence Hill, Max von Sydow, Ian Holm, Catherine Deneuve, Jack O'Halloran, Rufus, Marcel Bozzuffi, Liliane Rov\u00e8re, Andr\u00e9 Penvern, Paul Sherman, Vernon Dobtcheff, Marne Maitland, Gigi Bonos, Wolf Kahler, Jean Champion, Walter Gotell, Arnold Diamond, Guy Deghy, Eve Brenner, Margaret Modlin, Mathias Hell, Paul Antrim, Maurice Arden, Albert Woods, Villena || War, Drama || Live Action"]}, {"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Arnold Diamond"]}, {"page": "Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)", "response": ["*Arnold Diamond"]}, {"page": "Comedy Playhouse", "response": ["Tooth and Claw (28 April 1969) starring Warren Mitchell, Marty Feldman, Richard Caldicot, Anthony Dawes, Arnold Diamond, David Rowlands and Harry Brooks Jr."]}, {"page": "The Saint (TV series)", "response": ["Moore had a few recurring co-stars, especially Ivor Dean, who played Templar's nemesis, Inspector Teal. In three early episodes, Teal had been played by Campbell Singer, Norman Pitt, and Wensley Pithey; Dean featured from the episode \"Iris\" (7 November 1963) onward. Teal's relationship with Templar was broadly similar to that depicted in the novels, but in the series, he is often depicted as bungling, rather than merely Charteris's characterisation of him as an officious, unimaginative policeman. When in France, Templar had a similar relationship with Colonel Latignant (Arnold Diamond). Latignant is depicted as being even less competent than Teal, and is even keener than Teal to find Templar guilty, though Templar repeatedly helps him solve the case. Unlike Teal, Latignant did not appear in Charteris's novels. In all, Inspector Teal featured in 26 episodes and Colonel Latignant in six."]}, {"page": "Paranoiac (film)", "response": ["*Arnold Diamond as Publican"]}, {"page": "Maniac (1963 film)", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Janiello"]}, {"page": "My Brother and I", "response": ["*Arnold Diamond as Major-General Anstruther-Stevens"]}, {"page": "List of The Professionals episodes", "response": ["| Julian Holloway, George Pravda, Arnold Diamond, John Nettleton, Nadim Sawalha, Tony Vogel"]}, {"page": "The Great Riviera Bank Robbery", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Town Hall Man"]}, {"page": "A Dangerous Man: Lawrence After Arabia", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Georges Clemenceau"]}, {"page": "The Anniversary (1968 film)", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Headwaiter"]}, {"page": "March or Die (film)", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Husband"]}, {"page": "The Trouble with Women (Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased))", "response": ["*Arnold Diamond ....  1st Poker Player"]}, {"page": "Hand in Hand (film)", "response": ["*Arnold Diamond as Mr. Mathias"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond"]}, {"page": "Pathfinders (TV series)", "response": ["| Michael Coles, Arnold Diamond, Wolfe Morris, Jane Seymour, David Weston, Michael Wolf"]}, {"page": "The Bounder", "response": ["Guest stars: Ronnie Stevens as Hotel manager; Glyn Owen as \u2018Nipper\u2019; Dennis Ramsden as Charles; Alan Curtis as Toby; Arnold Diamond as Diner"]}, {"page": "Time Without Pity", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Third journalist"]}, {"page": "Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna", "response": ["*Arnold Diamond as Dr. Markov"]}, {"page": "The Girl on a Motorcycle", "response": ["* Arnold Diamond as Second French Customs Officer"]}, {"page": "Ghost Squad (TV series)", "response": ["* 20.
