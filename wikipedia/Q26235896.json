In a long career, he was cast in a variety of roles, but frequently in 'foreigner' roles, and often as policemen. Indeed, his most remembered role is probably that of Colonel Latignant in the 1960s ITC series The Saint with Roger Moore. The character of Latignant was one of the few recurring characters in the series' long run.Towards the end of his career he appeared in the BBC comedy series In Sickness and in Health as Mr Rabinsky, Alf Garnett's Jewish tight neighbour with a black hat and long beard.", "link_mentions": {}}}
