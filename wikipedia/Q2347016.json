He is currently a member of Brix & the Extricated with guitarist and vocalist Brix Smith Start.Hanley was a foundational Fall member, second only to Mark E. Smith in longevity in the band. With Peter Hook, Andy Rourke and Gary Mounfield, he is widely considered one of the pre-eminent Manchester-based bassists of his generation. He has always been very private and rarely interviewed; for this reason his 2014 autobiography The Big Midweek: Life Inside The Fall was highly anticipated, and was met with widespread acclaim for its frank honesty and dry, no nonsense humour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 29", "response": ["*  1959   \u2013 Steve Hanley, Irish-English bass player and songwriter"]}, {"page": "The Fall (band)", "response": ["The Fall were an English post-punk group, formed in 1976 in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. They underwent many line-up changes, with vocalist and founder Mark E. Smith as the only constant member. The Fall's long-term musicians included drummers Paul Hanley, Simon Wolstencroft and Karl Burns; guitarists Marc Riley, Craig Scanlon and Brix Smith; and bassist Steve Hanley, whose melodic, circular bass lines are widely credited with shaping the band's sound from early 1980s albums such as Hex Enduction Hour to the late 1990s.", "Bingo-Master's Break-Out! finally was released in August 1978 on Step Forward Records. The single \"It's the New Thing\" followed in November 1978, and in December the Fall recorded (in a single day) their debut album Live at the Witch Trials, which was released in March 1979. Burns quit the group shortly after the album was recorded, and was replaced by Mike Leigh from Rockin' Ricky, a cabaret band. In April 1979, Burns was followed by Martin Bramah, co-writer of most of the songs on Live at the Witch Trials and, according to writer Daryl Eslea, \"possibly the last true equal to Smith in the group\"; he went on to form Blue Orchids with Una Baines. Marc Riley switched from bass guitar to guitar, and Craig Scanlon (guitar) and Steve Hanley (bass guitar), former bandmates of Riley and members of Fall support act Staff 9, joined the group. Hanley's melodic basslines became a vital part of the Fall's music for almost two decades. Smith praised his playing in Melody Maker: \"The most original aspect of the Fall is Steve\u00a0... I've never heard a bass player like him\u00a0... I don't have to tell him what to play, he just knows. He is the Fall sound.\" Yvonne Pawlett left in July 1979 to look after her dog.
