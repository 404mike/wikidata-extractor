He made 25 Third Division North appearances in the 1937\u201338 season, as goalkeeping duties were split between himself and James Nicholls. However, he played just three Third Division South games in the 1938\u201339 season, as new signing Arthur Jepson became the club's first choice goalkeeper. Heppell was enlisted into the Army in February 1940. Despite this he managed to guest for Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough during World War II, before returning to Port Vale following his demobilization in January 1946. He was an ever-present during the 1946\u201347 season, as his form convinced the club to sell Jepson to rivals Stoke City. He remained Gordon Hodgson's first choice goalkeeper, playing 40 games in the 1947\u201348 campaign. He played 38 games in the 1948\u201349 season, ahead of reserves Ray Hancock and Harry Prince. However, he then lost his place, and played just three games in the 1949\u201350 season as new signing Ray King proved to be in impressive form. He featured 17 and 28 times in the 1950\u201351 and 1951\u201352 seasons, before being handed a free transfer away from Vale Park by new boss Freddie Steele in May 1952. He later played non-league football for Witton Albion."]}, {"page": "Ray King (footballer)", "response": ["He joined his brother George at Port Vale in May 1949. On his arrival King stated that The Old Recreation Ground was like 'some shanty town out west' and compared the dressing room to 'a dungeon', despite which somehow he 'felt completely at home'. He immediately established himself between the sticks, making 43 appearances to George Heppell's three in 1949\u201350. However his brother was sold to Barrow, and the two never played on the same team again. King featured 33 times in 1950\u201351, in Gordon Hodgson's last season as manager. King survived Ivor Powell's 'reign of terror' at the start of the 1951\u201352 season, and remained with the \"Valiants\" for the beginning of Freddie Steele's reign. Powell never selected King, as club chairman William Holdcroft was in a dispute with King over accommodation he had given him. King played only 19 Third Division South that season, and featured in just three Third Division North games in 1952\u201353, as Ray Hancock briefly established himself as the club's preferred goalkeeper. King was once again injured, this time after Steele severely damaged his hand during a practice match, apparently whilst still angry with King for conceding a goal to his brother in a defeat to Bradford City at Valley Parade."]}, {"page": "Charles Raymond Hancock", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ray Hancock"]}, {"page": "Raymond Hancock", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ray Hancock"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ray Hancock", "| May 1948 || GK ||  || Ray Hancock || Bury || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ray Hancock"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season began with a 2\u20131 win over Mansfield Town at Field Mill on 19 August; Chris Marron put Mansfield ahead on 52 minutes, before Roy Sproson scored the equaliser on 69 minutes, Basil Hayward scored the winning goal three minutes later after being the first to react to the rebound that came when Colin Askey's shot hit the crossbar.
