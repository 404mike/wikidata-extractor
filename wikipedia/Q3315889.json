Norman J. DeWitt surmised that Caesar's description of the role of druids in Gaulish society may report an idealized tradition, based on the society of the 2nd\u00a0century\u00a0BC, before the pan-Gallic confederation led by the Arverni was smashed in 121\u00a0BC, followed by the invasions of Teutones and Cimbri, rather than on the demoralized and disunited Gaul of his own time.DeWitt (1938) p\u00a0324\u00a0ff. John Creighton has speculated that in Britain, the druidic social influence was already in decline by the mid-1st\u00a0century\u00a0BCE, in conflict with emergent new power structures embodied in paramount chieftains. Other scholars see the Roman conquest itself as the main reason for the decline of the druid orders. with full bibliography. Archaeologist Miranda Aldhouse-Green (2010) asserted that Caesar offered both \"our richest textual source\" regarding the druids, and \"one of the most reliable\". She defended the accuracy of his accounts by highlighting that while he may have embellished some of his accounts to justify Roman imperial conquest, it was \"inherently unlikely\" that he constructed a fictional class system for Gaul and Britain, particularly considering that he was accompanied by a number of other Roman senators who would have also been sending reports on the conquest to Rome, and who would have challenged his inclusion of serious falsifications.", "Nonetheless, some archaeologists have attempted to link certain discoveries with written accounts of the druids. The archaeologist Anne Ross linked what she believed to be evidence of human sacrifice in Celtic pagan society\u2014such as the Lindow Man bog body\u2014to the Greco-Roman accounts of human sacrifice being officiated over by the druids. Miranda Aldhouse-Green, professor of archaeology at Cardiff University, has noted that Suetonius's army would have passed very near the site whilst traveling to deal with Boudicca and postulates that the sacrifice may have been connected. A 1996 discovery of a skeleton buried with advanced medical and possibly divinatory equipment has, however, been nicknamed the \"Druid of Colchester\".", "In the 20th\u00a0century, as new forms of textual criticism and archaeological methods were developed, allowing for greater accuracy in understanding the past, various historians and archaeologists published books on the subject of the druids and came to their own conclusions. Archaeologist Stuart Piggott, author of The Druids (1968), accepted the Greco-Roman accounts and considered the druids to be a barbaric and savage priesthood who performed human sacrifices.Piggott (1968) pp.\u00a092\u201398. This view was largely supported by another archaeologist, Anne Ross, author of Pagan Celtic Britain (1967) and The Life and Death of a Druid Prince (1989), though she believed that they were essentially tribal priests, having more in common with the shamans of tribal societies than with the classical philosophers.Ross (1967) pp.\u00a052\u201356. Ross' views were largely accepted by two other prominent archaeologists to write on the subject: Miranda Aldhouse-Green,Aldhouse-Green (1997) pp.\u00a031\u201333. author of The Gods of the Celts (1986), Exploring the World of the Druids (1997) and Caesar's Druids: Story of an Ancient Priesthood (2010); and Barry Cunliffe, author of Iron Age Communities in Britain (1991) and The Ancient Celts (1997).Cunliffe (2005) pp.\u00a0518\u2013520."]}]}}
