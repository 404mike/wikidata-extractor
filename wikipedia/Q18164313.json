He also designed jewellery to complement some of his paintings.\nBorn in Erith, Kent, White studied at the Medway College of Art between 1968 and 1972. Following this, he spent two years working for various advertising studios, until he received his first book cover commission in 1974, for Arthur C Clarke's The Other Side of the Sky. He later provided covers for authors including Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, August Derleth, H. P. Lovecraft, Piers Anthony and Bruce Sterling. He died on 6 April 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science fiction and fantasy artists", "response": ["*Tim White (1952\u20132020)"]}, {"page": "X-COM: Apocalypse", "response": ["Artist Terry Greer recalled: \"My main memory of Apocalypse was the pain we all went through. It was a hugely ambitious project and used a mix of rendered and hand drawn artwork from a variety of graphic styles (which didn't always work - although all the individual bits were great). Probably the worst fit was Tim White (an established SF artist) who had been commissioned to do the character designs. I like Tim's work, but his models were intensely detailed and quite unsuitable for reducing to the scale needed for an isometric game of this type. The creatures he designed looked great full screen, but reduced to the size they would be ingame they were often unrecognizable blobs. I don't know the reasons behind the decision to hire him, only that the problems were apparent to everyone in the art department, and I would have loved to have seen them ditched.\""]}, {"page": "John Sinclair (German fiction)", "response": ["Almost all John Sinclair stories in the series have been written exclusively by Helmut Rellergerd under the nom-de-plume of Jason Dark. Only a few of the earliest stories have been written by other authors. As of late, creation of new stories is divided among Rellergerd and several new authors, each of them writing separate full episodes; the new writers are attributed for their respective stories. For example, the Oculus duology (2017) was written by Wolfgang Hohlbein, while forensic biologist Mark Benecke was the author of the novel Brandmal. Over the decades the Spanish painter Vicen\u00e7 Badalona Ballestar has created numerous paintings and illustrations for the bestselling series.Vicente Ballestar in: Pulpinternational Other artists that contributed artworks and cover designs for John Sinclair include Tim White, Les Edwards, Luis Royo, Vicente Segrelles, Ron Walotsky, Alan M.

Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was also used as the cover art for the issue.  Artists featured in subsequent issues included Tim White, David A.

Chris Foss contributed the cover for the second issue; the sf historian David Kyle describes it as \"a cross between the technologically reasoned, deep-space vehicle of 2001 and the inspired gimcrackery of artist Richard Powers\", adding that it illustrates a trend in the 1970s towards \"heavily pseudo-technological\" artwork for science fiction paperback covers."]}, {"page": "Timothy White", "response": ["Timothy White or Tim White may refer to:", "* Tim White (American football) (born 1994), American football wide receiver", "* Tim White (artist) (1952\u20132020), British SF artist and book illustrator", "* Tim White (newscaster/reporter) (born 1949), American news anchor and investigative reporter", "* Tim White (wrestling) (born 1954), American wrestling referee"]}, {"page": "BSFA Award for Best Artwork", "response": ["*1982: Tim White", "*Tim White ", "*Tim White ", "*Tim White ", "*Tim White ", "*Tim White ", "*Tim White"]}, {"page": "Unreal (1990 video game)", "response": ["The original artwork is designed by Tim White."]}, {"page": "Wizards (Mayfair Games)", "response": ["Wizards was edited by Bill Fawcett, with a cover by Tim White, and was published by Mayfair Games in 1983 as a 112-page book."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*Tim White, 68, British painter.Tim White (1952-2020)"]}]}}
