The conditions in the infirmary when she arrived were described as \"disorder, extravagance of every description in the establishment to an incredible degree\". Soon after she arrived, Jones brought 12 trained nurses and seven probationers (all trained at the Nightingale School of Nursing in London) to the infirmary. This initial group were supplemented by further probationers and 54 able-bodied female inmates who were paid a small salary. This was the first training for nurses in any workhouse infirmary, paving the way for nurse training systems in other workhouses across the UK; social reformer Eva McLaren was among those trained there as a nurse."]}]}}
