And it features a great deal of fine, thoughtful acting, which can always be counted on in a film by Mr. Sayles\". \"All the film's characters are flesh and blood\", Maslin added, pointing particularly to the portrayals by Kristofferson, Canada, James, Morton and Colon. Film critics Dennis West and Joan M. West of Cineaste praised the psychological aspects of the film, writing, \"Lone Star strikingly depicts the personal psychological boundaries that confront many citizens of Frontera as a result of living in such close proximity to the border\".
