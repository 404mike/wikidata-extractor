However, he retracted the announcement that he would be leaving the following day. In October 2010, Fry left Twitter for a few days, with a farewell message of \"Bye bye\", following press criticism of a quote taken from an interview he had given. After returning, he explained that he had left Twitter to \"avoid being sympathised with or told about an article\" he \"would otherwise never have got wind of\". In some quarters, the general methods Fry uses on Twitter have been criticised. On 15 February 2016, Fry deleted his Twitter account, after receiving criticism for a tweet about Jenny Beavan and her dress. Fry alluded to this on an April 2016 episode of The Rubin Report in which he criticised groupthink mentality and stated that his return to Twitter was a \"maybe\".
