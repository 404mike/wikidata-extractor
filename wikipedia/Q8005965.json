He trained at the Trustee's Academy and in Rome and was elected to the Scottish Academy in 1830 while still in his twenties. His first work to gain significant public attention was his Alexander and Bucephasus. His 1832 design for a statue of Sir Water Scott was incorporated into the author's memorial in Edinburgh. It marked the beginnings of a national school of sculpture based around major figures from Scottish culture and Scottish and British history. The tradition of Scottish sculpture was taken forward by artists such as Patric Park (1811\u201355), Alexander Handyside Ritchie (1804\u201370) and William Calder Marshall (1813\u201394). This reached fruition in the next generation of sculptors including William Brodie (1815\u201381), Amelia Hill (1820\u20131904) and Steell's apprentice David Watson Stevenson (1842\u20131904). Stevenson contributed the statue of William Wallace on the exterior of the Wallace Monument and many of the busts in the gallery of heroes inside, which included Robert the Bruce, John Knox, Walter Scott, Robert Burns, James Watt and Thomas Carlyle. Public sculpture was boosted by the centenary of Burns' death in 1896. Stevenson produced a statue of the poet in Leith. Hill produced one for Dumfries. John Steell produced a statue for Central Park in New York, versions of which were made for Dundee, London and Dunedin. Statues of Burns and Scott were produced in areas of Scottish settlement, particularly in North America and Australia.MacDonald, Scottish Art, pp.\u00a0125\u20137."]}, {"page": "1881 in Scotland", "response": ["* 30 October \u2013 William Brodie, sculptor (born 1815)"]}, {"page": "1815 in Scotland", "response": ["* 22 January \u2013 William Brodie, sculptor (died 1881)"]}]}}
