He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the 2007\u201308 season, as Tranmere lost 2\u20131 at home to Leeds United at a packed Prenton Park. Chorley scored his first goal for the club in a 2\u20131 away win at Southend United in October 2007, volleying home Paul McLaren's corner to give Tranmere the lead \u2013 the win stretched the club's unbeaten run to nine games. It was to be his only goal of the campaign, making 36 appearances in a season where he was in and out of the first-team due to facing tough competition from fellow central defender Antony Kay. His second year at Tranmere saw Chorley become an integral part of the side, playing in 45 of the 46 league matches, as well as making a further eight appearances in cup competitions. During the season, Chorley doubled his goal tally for the club, scoring in a 2\u20131 loss to Hartlepool United at Victoria Park in March 2009. Tranmere narrowly missed out on the final play-off position after drawing 1\u20131 with Scunthorpe United on the last day of the season, with Scunthorpe subsequently holding onto sixth place after scoring an equaliser with two minutes remaining. It was to be Chorley's last game for the club.

His first appearance of the season came on 28 August 2010, coming on as a substitute for Paul McLaren in the 34th minute, in a 2\u20132 draw against Dagenham & Redbridge. He made his first starts of the season on 27 October 2010, starting the whole game, against Stockport County in the Football League Trophy campaign and helped the side beat them on penalty shootout after the game went extra time. However, in his second start of the season, Bakayogo was sent\u2013off for a second bookable offence, in a 4\u20132 against Milton Keynes Dons on 30 October 2010. He then spent several months back to the substitute bench. After being sidelined with an injury in January, Bakayogo soon regained his first team place following Cresswell's injury. Bakoyogo then scored his first goal for the club in a match against Exeter City on 1 March 2011. He later helped the side finish in eighteen place and fought off relegation for the second time at the end of the 2010\u201311 season. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season, making thirty appearances and scoring once in all competitions, he signed a further two-year contract with Tranmere Rovers until 2013."]}, {"page": "Harry Worley", "response": ["Worley made his first appearance of the 2011\u201312 season, where he came on as a late substitute for Paul McLaren, in a 1\u20130 win over Dagenham & Redbridge on 13 September 2011. However, Worley was soon on the sidelines for a month with ankle injury, which he sustained in training. Worley made his return from injury, where he made his first start of the season, in a 2\u20131 loss against Southend United on 5 November 2011. However, throughout the 2011\u201312 season, with eleven appearances in all competition, Worley spent most of the season on the substitute bench and lost his first team place by newly signing, Michael Duberry and his own injury concern."]}, {"page": "Kyle Nix", "response": ["Nix started Bradford's first two games of the 2008\u201309 season in place of Joe Colbeck, who was suspended following a red card against Milton Keynes Dons at the end of the previous campaign. However, when Colbeck was available again, Nix was dropped to the substitutes' bench, with new signing Paul McLaren partnering Lee Bullock, who had returned from injury, in central midfield. Nix struggled for form but was also playing with an ankle injury, which eventually forced him to take a hospital scan in November. He was one of six club midfielders to be injured at the time. He returned to action later that month as a second-half substitute against his father's former team Rotherham United, at the Don Valley Stadium. However, he struggled to hold down a regularly place in the side because of new midfielders signed during the course of the season, and he was released at the end of the campaign having played less than half the games that he played in his first year at City. Nix was offered the chance to return to Bradford by McCall if he could not find a new club but he rejected the invitation."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["City returned to pre-season training on 1 July 2008 with a fifth new player, after Tranmere midfielder Paul McLaren signed a two-year deal. Two weeks after pre-season training started, City played their first friendly when they lost 3\u20131 to Farsley Celtic, the only City goal coming from a Barry Conlon penalty. City's side included several trialists, including goalkeeper Nick Colgan, Korey Nix (brother of City midfielder Kyle) and Rory Boulding. Rory's elder brother Michael, who had also been training with City, was unable to play because of an injury. The second pre-season came three days later, when City defeated Bradford rivals Bradford Park Avenue 3\u20131, selecting a squad which included a number of youth team players. City's third friendly was a 2\u20131 defeat by another West Yorkshire non-league side, Guiseley, who featured former Bradford player David Brown on trial. City embarked on a short tour of Scotland, where they defeated Dundee 1\u20130 but lost 4\u20130 to Motherwell. During the tour, the club signed brothers Michael and Rory Boulding on free transfers. Upon their return to England, City lost their next friendly 2\u20131 to Burnley. Following his form in several trial games, including a string of saves against Burnley, goalkeeper Rhys Evans, who had played on loan the previous season with City, became City's latest signing on 1 August 2008. Three days later, City's next friendly resulted in a 1\u20130 victory against League One side Oldham Athletic. The final pre-season friendly was played behind closed doors, when City lost 2\u20130 to Sheffield Wednesday with a team made up of juniors and reserve players. A day before the start of the season, McCall signed defender TJ Moncur on loan from Fulham as cover at right back. The agreement gave Bradford the option to sign Moncur, who had also played seven games on loan the previous season, on a permanent contract once the loan finished on 3 January 2009.", "City started the season with a 2\u20131 victory at home to Notts County. Striker Peter Thorne, who had been Bradford's top goalscorer in the 2007\u201308 season and scored a hat-trick in the corresponding fixture, scored both Bradford's goals. City again lost at the first round stage of the League Cup for the third successive season, this time 4\u20130 to West Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town. Thorne, who had been rested to the substitutes' bench for the defeat at Huddersfield, returned for City's second league game when he scored both goals in a 2\u20130 victory at Macclesfield Town. City maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 2\u20130 victory against Rochdale on 23 August 2008. It was the first time since the 2001\u201302 season that City had won their first three games of the season. Michael Boulding opened the scoring with his first City goal before Thorne added his fifth of the campaign. McCall stated he wanted to sign one more player before the August transfer deadline, before bringing in South African midfielder Dean Furman from his former side Rangers on loan until January. City's winning start to the league season came to an end with a defeat by Aldershot Town\u2014the first time the two sides had met.
