Business deals behind the back of London textile magnate Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) also backfired. Feast refused to sign a new contract, stating in the British national press that he didn't want to become \"another Coronation Street cabbage\" which some thought to be referring to several cast members, possibly Peter Dudley (who played Bert Tilsley), Jack Howarth (who played Albert Tatlock) and Bernard Youens (who played Stan Ogden), all of whom had recently died, and thus the remark was deemed tasteless. Fred Gee was not killed off at that point, he was simply never mentioned again. He last appeared in the soap in November 1984. His place at the Rovers was taken by Jack Duckworth (William Tarmey).
