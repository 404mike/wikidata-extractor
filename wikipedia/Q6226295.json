He then transitioned to a successful orange farmer. He cultivated and experimented with oranges leading him to become a reputable authority figure on oranges. In December 1885 Slomon shipped a crate of oranges to John Clayton in Liverpool, England. Slomon decided to invest all of his savings in orange cultivation but unfortunately ruined him when the Great Freeze of 1894\u20131895 destroyed much of the citrus crop of Florida. The effects of the Great Freeze financially ruined Slomon as well as his health due to Bright's disease. On March 20, 1898 Sloman dies in Ocala leaving behind twelve children."]}]}}
