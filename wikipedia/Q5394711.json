Bajana", "response": ["At the time of Bajana's arrival in the Somerset team, the county were struggling to compete in the County Championship, and were making a financial loss.Roebuck (1991), pp. 107\u2013113. In three of the four years prior to 1912, Somerset had finished bottom of the championship table, and there was little improvement in the final three years before the First World War, each of which resulted in a bottom-three finish.Roebuck (1991), p. 411. The Somerset cricket historian, David Foot, records that at this time, the county's recruitment policy was \"susceptible to exotic grandeur and haughty lineage,\" and suggested that a player's cricketing ability was often a secondary consideration to their social standing. Bajana made his debut for Somerset in May 1912, opening the batting for the county against Sussex. He scored twenty-two and seven in a six-wicket victory for his county. In the subsequent match, against Hampshire, Bajana scored his first half-century in county cricket, hitting 71 runs in the second innings; the highest score of any Somerset batsman in the match. He passed 50 on three further occasions that year, and along with Len Braund and Ernie Robson, was ever-present in the Somerset team that season. His year's aggregate of 575 runs in the County Championship, and his score of 95, made against Worcestershire in August, were both the county's best that season, in a year in which no player scored a century for Somerset."]}, {"page": "West of England cricket team", "response": ["* Ernie Robson (1910)"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 1122 || Ernie Robson", "| 256 || Ernie Robson", "| 424 || Ernie Robson || 1895-1923"]}, {"page": "Christopher Scott-Malden", "response": ["Scott-Malden's batting and bowling styles are unknown.

Batting once in the match, he was dismissed for 10 runs in the MCC first innings by Ernie Robson, with the MCC winning the match by an innings and 175 runs. Returning to British India, he was promoted to the lieutenant colonel in February 1902, with promotion to brevet colonel in the 8th Cavalry following in May 1905. Between 1906 and 1910, Rivett-Carnac commanded the Ambala Cavalry Brigade. In July 1909 he was made a colonel on the staff and was granted the temporary rank of brigadier-general. He retired from active service in February 1914. Rivett-Carnac retired to England, where he died at Beaulieu, Hampshire. His elder brothers, Sir William and Sir Clennell, were the 5th and 6th Baronets respectively of the Rivett-Carnac baronets."]}]}}
