William Campbell, minister of Kilchrenan, which appears to state that the original compilation was completed at Glenmasan (now Glen Massan or Gleann Masain, on the Cowal peninsula in the parish of Dunoon, Argyll) in the year 1268. Based on the alternation of the spelling ao and ai for the same diphthong, Donald MacKinnon assigns a date no later than the end of the 15th century and suggests that the manuscript may well have been a first-hand copy of this early 13th-century exemplar. The presence of older linguistic features in the texts points to even earlier strata of writing. MacKinnon therefore proposes the scenario that an early Irish manuscript may have reached Argyll before c. 1238, that about this time, a reworked version was produced, and that the surviving manuscript represents a transcript of the latter made sometime before 1500. A late, anonymous hand on folio 19 wrote Leabhar Echdra ata ann so ar a scriobha le Eoin M'Tavis, \"This is a book of adventures written by John M'Tavish\", a name which recurs a few times elsewhere in the manuscript and fits the Argyll provenance of the text. He may have been the principal scribe, although there is no way of verifying this claim.", "The manuscript appeared in a brighter light in the late 18th century, when the Committee of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland requested proof that the Ossian published by James Macpherson was a translation from genuinely ancient Scottish Gaelic poetry.MacKinnon, \"The Glenmasan manuscript.\" p. 5. After the death of Rev. William Campbell in 1793, the manuscript seems to have found its way back to Kilmodan, the parish of his birth.  Here Sir William MacLeod Bannatyne found it in the hands of the Rev. John Mackinnon (1753-1803), who said that he had acquired it from people in his neighbourhood.  Bannatyne passed the manuscript on to the Highland Society of Scotland, whose minutes record that it was laid before the Ossian Committee in March 1799.  Donald MacKinnon suggests that were it not for the controversy over Macpherson, the manuscript might never have come to light.", "A transcript was first made by Ewen MacLachlan (1773\u20131822) in his Leabhar Caol (\"Narrow Book\", National Library of Scotland Adv.MS.72.3.5).
