Patrick (born 1947 in Devonshire) is an English organist. He was educated at Exeter School and then pursued his musical education at the Royal College of Music in London with distinction winning the Stuart Prize for organ in 1967 and going on to gain the coveted Walford Davies Prize the following year. This award brought him prestigious recitals at both Westminster Cathedral and Westminster Abbey as well as the honour of being presented to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.\nHis early decision to specialise in the romantic and modern French repertoire followed logically from his impulse to accept the highest technical and artistic challenges which the organ presents. Of particular note was his recording of the complete works of Maurice Durufle made at Coventry Cathedral in 1996.  This was a Critic's Choice of the Year in the B.B.C. Music Magazine in 1997 and in the final list of three highly recommended recordings in the B.B.C. programme \"Building a Library\" in May 2006.\nDavid M. Patrick has performed public concerts at many major venues in Great Britain, the United States, Canada and Europe as well as numerous recitals for the BBC on significant British instruments. Patrick lived and worked in Norway from 1996 until December 2012 when he returned to Devon. Many of his recordings are available from Amazon, iTunes and Spotify.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Exeter School", "response": ["*David M.
