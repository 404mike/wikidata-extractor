This dating in part reflects the scholarship of Yoshitake Kobayashi, who dates the Symbolum Nicenum section to August\u2013October 1748 based on Bach's increasingly stiff and labored handwriting.Yoshitake Kobayahsi, \"Zur Chronologie der Sp\u00e4twerke Johann Sebastian Bachs, Kompositions- und Auffuhrungst\u00e4tigket vom 1736\u201350\" Bach-Jahrbuch 74 (1988): 7\u201372 Wolff among others argues that the \"Et incarnatus est\" movement was Bach's last significant composition.Christoph Wolff, Bach: Essays on his Life and Music, Harvard University Press,, 1991: p. 332 The words had been included in the preceding duet, but then Bach decided to treat them as a separate movement for the choir, giving the words extra weight and improving the symmetry of the Credo.Christoph Wolff, h-Moll-Messe, Berlin Philharmonic 12 October 2006 John Butt argues that a definite final date of August 25, 1749 can be given, in that on this date C. P. E. Bach completed a setting of the Magnificat with an \"Amen\" chorus that \"shows distinct similarities\" to the 'Gratias' from the Missa and the 'Et expecto' from the Symbolum Nicenum.\"John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press, 1991, , pp. 20\u201321. C. P. E. Bach later reported that he performed this Magnificat (Wq 215) in 1749 in Leipzig \"at a Marian festival\u00a0... during the lifetime of his now-deceased father\".\"an einem Marienfeste ... noch zu den Lebzeiten des nunmehro seligen Herrn Vaters.\" Bach-Dokumente III, 703.", "Bach did not give the B minor Mass a title. Instead, he organized the 1748\u201349 manuscript into four folders, each with a different title. That containing the Kyrie and Gloria he called \"1. Missa\"; that containing the Credo he titled \"2. Symbolum Nicenum\"; the third folder, containing the Sanctus, he called \"3. Sanctus\"; and the remainder, in a fourth folder he titled \"4. Osanna | Benedictus | Agnus Dei et | Dona nobis pacem\".

Malcolm Boyd and John Butt, Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 284 On the other hand, the parts in the manuscript are numbered from 1 to 4, and Bach's usual closing formula (S.D.G = Soli Deo Gloria) is only found at the end of the Dona Nobis Pacem.

Bach, who inherited the score. There, it is called \"Die Grosse Catholische Messe\" (the \"Great Catholic Mass\"). It is called that as well in the estate of his last heir in 1805, suggesting to Stauffer that \"the epithet reflects an oral tradition within the Bach family\".George Stauffer, Bach: The Mass in B Minor, p. 180 The first publication of the Kyrie and Gloria, in 1833 by the Swiss collector Hans Georg N\u00e4geli with Simrock, refers to it as \"Messe\" Finally, Nageli and Simrock produced the first publication in 1845, calling it the \"High Mass in B Minor\" (Hohe Messe in h-moll). The adjective \"high\", Butt argues, was \"strongly influenced by the monumental impact of Beethoven's Missa solemnis.\" It soon fell from common usage, but the prepositional phrase \"in B Minor\" survives, even though it is in some ways misleading: only five of the work's 27 movements are in B minor, while twelve, including the final ones of each of the four major sections, are in D major (the relative major of B minor). The opening Kyrie, however, is in B minor, with the Christe Eleison in D major, and the second Kyrie in F-sharp minor; as Butt points out, these tonalities outline a B minor chord.John Butt, \"Mass in B Minor\", in Oxford Composer Companions: J.

Christoph Wolff argues that on July 26, 1733 at the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Wilhelm Friedemann Bach had been organist since June, it \"was definitely performed ... as evidenced by the extant Dresden performing parts and by the inscription on the title wrapper\" given to the king the next day.Christoph Wolff, Bach: The Learned Musician, W.W. Norton, 2000, pp. 368\u2013370,  Hans-Joachim Schulze made this case by pointing to the use of the past tense in the wrapper's inscription: \"To his royal majesty was shown with the enclosed Missa ... the humble devotion of the author J.

Bach: A Life in Music, Cambridge University Press, 2007, pp. 219\u201320,  However, there is evidence of an organ recital by Bach at the Sophienkirche on 14 September 1731, and Friedemann Bach was only chosen as Organist for the institution on 23 June 1733. He would again perform a 2-hour Organ recital on 1 December 1736 at the Frauenkirche Dresden to inaugurate the new Gottfried Silbermann organ.", "Scholars agree that no other public performances took place in Bach's lifetime, although Butt raises the possibility that there may have been a private performance or read-through of the Symbolum Nicenum late in Bach's life.John Butt, Bach: Mass in B Minor, pp. 20\u201321.", "The Mass was described in the 19th century by the editor Hans Georg N\u00e4geli as \"The Announcement of the Greatest Musical Work of All Times and All People\" (\"Ank\u00fcndigung des gr\u00f6\u00dften musikalischen Kunstwerkes aller Zeiten und V\u00f6lker\").'Markus Rathey, Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B Minor: The Greatest Artwork of All Times and All People The Tangeman Lecture delivered April 18, 2003 Despite being seldom performed, the Mass was appreciated by some of Bach's greatest successors: by the beginning of the 19th century Forkel and Haydn possessed copies.John Butt Mass in B Minor\u2014Bach's only complete setting of the latin ordinary of the Mass ", "Christoph Wolff's edition, published by C.F.

For instance, jazz musicians have adopted Bach's music, with Jacques Loussier, Ian Anderson, Uri Caine, and the Modern Jazz Quartet among those creating jazz versions of his works. Several 20th-century composers referred to Bach or his music, for example Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in Six Sonatas for solo violin, Dmitri Shostakovich in 24 Preludes and Fugues and Heitor Villa-Lobos in Bachianas Brasileiras. All kinds of publications involved Bach: not only were there the Bach Jahrbuch publications of the Neue Bachgesellschaft, various other biographies and studies by among others Albert Schweitzer, Charles Sanford Terry, Alfred D\u00fcrr, Christoph Wolff. Peter Williams, John Butt, and the 1950 first edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis; but also books such as G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach put the composer's art in a wider perspective. Bach's music was extensively listened to, performed, broadcast, arranged, adapted, and commented upon in the 1990s.Rokus de Groot (2000). \"And Nowhere Bach.

The orchestral parts on the other hand were executed as a fair copy. Various possible explanations have been proposed as to why Bach assembled the collection of harpsichord concertos at this particular time. One centres on his role as director of the Collegium Musicum in Leipzig, a municipal musical society, which gave weekly concerts at the Caf\u00e9 Zimmermann, drawing many performers from students at the university. Bach served as director from spring 1729 to summer 1737; and again from October 1739 until 1740 or 1741. John Butt suggests that the manuscript was prepared for performances on Bach's resumption as director in 1739, additional evidence coming from the fact that the manuscript subsequently remained in Leipzig. Peter Wollny, however, considers it unlikely that The Collegium Musicum would have required orchestral parts that were so neatly draughted; he considers it more plausible that the manuscript was prepared for a visit that Bach made to Dresden in 1738 when he would almost certainly have given private concerts in court (or to the nobility) and the ripieno parts would have been played by the resident orchestra. Peter Williams has also suggested that the collection would have been a useful addition to the repertoire of his two elder sons, Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel, both employed as professional keyboard-players at the time of writing. Williams has also speculated that it might not be mere coincidence that the timing matched the publication of the first ever collection of keyboard concertos, the widely acclaimed and well-selling Organ concertos, Op.4 of George Frederic Handel published in London and Paris in 1738."]}, {"page": "Johann Christoph Bach (organist at Ohrdruf)", "response": ["The brother had however not died \"soon after\".Forkel/Terry 1920/2011, footnotes 57 and 58 p. 11 Having stayed with his brother for five years Johann Sebastian left Ohrdruf, joining the choir of St. Michael's Convent at L\u00fcneburg.Forkel/Terry 1920/2011, footnotes 59 and 60 pp. 11\u201312 Around the time Johann Sebastian left L\u00fcneburg a few years later he composed a Capriccio in E major in honor of his eldest brother, BWV 993.Spitta 1899, pp. 249\u2013250 In the years that followed Johann Christoph copied several compositions by his younger brother, such as those in the Andreas Bach Book, kept by one of his sons, and the M\u00f6ller Manuscript.
