A test of germination was carried out by Smith starting in 1999. Seeds were extracted from two mature cones collected from the same tree, a cultivated specimen at Petrie, just north of Brisbane (originally the homestead of Thomas Petrie, the son of the first European to report the species).  One hundred apparently full seeds were selected and planted into 30\u00a0cm by 12\u00a0cm plastic tubes commercially filled with sterile potting mix in early February 1999.  These were then placed in a shaded area and watered weekly. Four tubes were lost due to being knocked over.  Of a total of 100 seeds placed, 87 germinated. The tubes were checked monthly for emergence over 3 years. Of these seeds, 55 emerged from April to December, 1999; 32 emerged from January to September in 2000, 1 seed emerged in January 2001, and the last 1 appeared in February 2001."]}, {"page": "Petrie railway station", "response": ["Petrie railway station is located on the North Coast line in Queensland, Australia.

By 1869, many of the Turrbal had died from gunshot or disease, but the Moreton Bay Courier makes frequent mention of local indigenous people who were working and living in the district.
