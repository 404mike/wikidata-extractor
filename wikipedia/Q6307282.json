Brian Stein had already returned from FC Annecy for a second spell and Pleat had revived the forward line which had played a big part in Luton's success a few years earlier. Stein scored only three goals in 39 league appearances over the course of the season, but Harford proved to be a success once again as he ended the season as the club's top scorer for the season with 12 goals. The loan signing of goalkeeper Steve Sutton from Nottingham Forest revived Luton for a period, but the Board refused to supply the \u00a3300,000 fee required to keep Sutton permanently. Various loan signings such as veteran forward Imre Varadi failed to galvanise the side, but come the last day, Luton still had an outside chance of avoiding relegation, having won 10 league games at home but failed to win any of their away fixtures. Luton travelled to already-relegated Notts County knowing that they had to win their first away match of the season, and hope that Coventry lost at Aston Villa. Julian James gave Luton the lead they required, but two late goals from Rob Matthews saw County drag Luton down with them. Almost 30 years on, they have still yet to return to the top flight and have rarely looked like achieving it.

Luton were reduced to ten men in the 58th minute when Julian James was shown his second yellow card; ten minutes later, Colin Little struck for Crewe to secure a 2\u20131 win.  The second leg of the semi-final took place at Kenilworth Road in Luton three days later.  Oldfield scored twice in an 11-minute spell: on 20 minutes he levelled the aggregate score after a mistake from Lee Unsworth, then took advantage of a lapse of concentration from Ashley Westwood to double his and Luton's tally.  Little scored for Crewe within a minute with a header after a failed clearance from Luton goalkeeper Ian Feuer.  Smith then scored midway through the second half to make it 2\u20132 on the evening, and ensure Crewe's progression to the final with a 4\u20133 aggregate victory."]}]}}
