This time he did leave, moving to Rochdale together with Durham team-mate Billy Bertram. Although Bertram stayed, Robson moved on again after four appearances to another Third Division North club, Lincoln City, who had just sold Wally Webster to Sheffield United for a record fee and opted to spend the proceeds on strengthening their half-back line. Lincoln's manager, Horace Henshall, thought Robson \"the best half in any Northern Section team\", and proceeded to select him, mainly at centre half, for the rest of the season. Robson missed six weeks of the 1926\u201327 season after suffering an injury in the second match, came back into the side for another two weeks and was dropped for a further six, but once Lincoln were able to field a settled half-back line, with Robson at centre, Alf Basnett on the right and Alf Hale on the left, they found a run of form that included seven consecutive wins in March and April and took the team into mid-table. Robson lost his place at centre half to close-season arrival Charles Foulkes, made just four appearances in the 1927\u201328 season, and was released on a free transfer."]}, {"page": "Walter Webster", "response": ["* Wally Webster (1895\u20131980), footballer, played for Walsall, Lincoln City, Sheffield United, Torquay United, Rochdale and Barrow"]}]}}
