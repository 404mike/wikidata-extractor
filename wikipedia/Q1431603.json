He was a British pop singer at the start of the 1960s.\nHe was born in Farnborough, Hampshire, one of ten children.  As a singer, he was managed by Larry Parnes, who chose his stage name - along with those of many other pop singers of the period including Billy Fury, Marty Wilde, Vince Eager and Georgie Fame - and was signed to HMV Records.  His first single, \"Image of a Girl\", a cover version of a US top ten hit by The Safaris, reached No. 37 on the UK Singles Chart in 1960, but was outsold by Mark Wynter's rival version of the same song.  Two follow-ups, \"Keep Loving Me\" (1960) and \"Miracles Are Happening To Me\" (1961) failed to reach the chart, and Keene's recording career appears to have ended at that point.He was reported as living in Australia in 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Larry Parnes", "response": ["After Steele's success, Parnes looked to find other young men who he could groom to become pop stars. At Bart's suggestion, he next signed Reg Patterson (n\u00e9 Smith), whom he re-christened Marty Wilde, and who also rose to pop stardom in the UK.  Parnes developed a network of contacts within the British recording industry and entertainment business, with leading British songwriters providing songs for his growing stable of talent, and many of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s achieving success in the UK Singles Chart.  A flamboyant gay man, Parnes' approach was to select, and then groom, handsome young men who would be attractive to a teenage audience. He also gave them new stage names, which were rumoured to reflect what he considered to be their sexual characteristics.  Among those he managed with at least some degree of success were Billy Fury (originally Ron Wycherley), Vince Eager (Roy Taylor), Dickie Pride (Richard Knellar), Lance Fortune (Chris Morris), Duffy Power (Ray Howard), Johnny Gentle (John Askew), Terry Dene (Terence Williams), Nelson Keene (Malcolm Holland), and Georgie Fame (Clive Powell).  He also managed Tommy Bruce, as well as Joe Brown, who he unsuccessfully tried to persuade to change his name to Elmer Twitch."]}, {"page": "Nelson (given name)", "response": ["*Nelson Keene (born 1942), British singer"]}, {"page": "Keene (surname)", "response": ["* Nelson Keene (born Malcolm Holland, 1942), British pop singer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Nelson Keene, singer, was born in Farnborough"]}, {"page": "Image of a Girl", "response": ["*Nelson Keene released a version of the song as a single in 1960 which reached #37 on the UK Singles Chart."]}]}}
