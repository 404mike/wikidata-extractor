The fossil was recovered from an exposure of rock from the Katberg Formation in the Lystrosaurus Assemblage Zone. At the time, Parrington described the first Prolacerta fossil, the early evolutionary relationships of archosaurs was even more poorly understood than they are currently.  Due to its small size and lizard-like appearance, Parrington subsequently placed Prolacerta between basal younginids and modern lizards. Parrington's classification of Prolacerta was accepted for several decades, including by the paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp who conducted further research on Prolacerta. It was only after more Prolacerta fossils were found that more in depth research was undertaken on this animal. In the 1970s the close link between Prolacerta and crown archosaurs was first hypothesized, which lead to numerous phylogenetic analyses being conducted on Prolacerta and other stem archosaurs from the 1980s onwards.Groenewald, G.H. and Kitching, J.W., 1995.

It was collected by the English paleontologist Francis Rex Parrington in the early 1930s from the Lifua Member of Manda Beds of the Ruhuhu Basin in Songea Urban District of southwestern Tanzania, which dates back to the late Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic. Ruhuhuaria was first described and named by Linda Akiko Tsuji, Gabriela Sobral and Johannes M\u00fcller in 2013 and the type species is Ruhuhuaria reiszi. The generic name is derived from the name of the Ruhuhu Basin. The specific name, reiszi, honors the Canadian paleontologist Robert R. Reisz. Due to the poor preservation of the holotype, the phylogenetic position of Ruhuhuaria within Owenettidae is uncertain. Ruhuhuaria being the second youngest owenettid to date, supports the persistence of owenettids into the Middle Triassic and their coexistence with procolophonids."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1962", "response": ["*Francis Rex Parrington"]}, {"page": "Aenigmastropheus", "response": ["Fossils of Aenigmastropheus were first described by the British paleontologist Dr. Francis Rex Parrington in 1956, in an article titled as \"A problematic reptile from the Upper Permian\". Parrington reported collecting these remains in the Ruhuhu Valley in the Songea District of southern Tanzania in 1933, and considered them to come from a single individual. This specimen, UMZC T836, in currently housed at the University Museum of Zoology, in Cambridge, UK. UMZC T836 consists of a partial postcranial skeleton including five posterior cervical and anterior dorsal vertebrae, the distal half of the right humerus, a fragment of probable left humeral shaft, the proximal end of the right ulna, and three indeterminate fragments of bone, one of which may represent a partial radius.", "In his article, Parrington (1956) highlighted the apparent contrast between the primitive appearance of the forelimb bones and the more derived appearance of the vertebrae, resembling those of archosaurs. Thus, he concluded that the specimen did not bear close resemblances to any known synapsid, including the ones collected at the same locality, and suggested possible close affinities with archosaurs due to the vertebral morphology and the presence of hollow limb bones and an ectepicondylar groove on the humerus. Hughes (1963) subsequently noted similar vertebral morphology in some \"pelycosaurian\" synapsids and concluded that, as the combination of a derived vertebral column and a primitive limb structure occurs in proterosuchian archosauromorphs, UMZC T836 might possibly be a proterosuchian ancestor. Subsequent studies came to a similar conclusion, listing the specimen as a possible member of Proterosuchidae, however Gower and Sennikov (2000) noted that it still could possibly be archosaurian. Ezcurra, Butler and Gower (2013) indicated that UMZC T836 is an archosauromorph likely not referable to Archosauriformes, and thus not proterosuchian. Aenigmastropheus was first erected for UMZC T836 by Mart\u00edn D. Ezcurra, Torsten M. Scheyer and Richard J. Butler in 2014 and the type species is Aenigmastropheus parringtoni, following a re-description of this \"problematic reptile\". The generic name is derived from aenigma, \"enigmatic\" in Latin, and stropheus, \"vertebra\" in Greek, in allusion to the problematic taxonomic history of the holotype and only known specimen. The specific name, parringtoni, honors Dr. Francis Rex Parrington for the discovery and initial description of UMZC T836, and for his contribution to the understanding of Permo-Triassic amniotes."]}, {"page": "R.

He enrolled in Queen's University Belfast, earning a BSc in Zoology (1948) and a first BSc in Geology (1949).
