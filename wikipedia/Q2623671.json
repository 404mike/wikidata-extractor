McCarthy (1920 \u2013 3 November 1987 London) was an English jazz and blues discographer, critic, historian, and editor.\nMcCarthy began listening to jazz in his teens, and edited publications of the Jazz Sociological Society in the 1940s. He edited the short-lived journal Jazz Forum until publication ceased in 1947.\nMcCarthy, along with Dave Carey (1914\u20131999) and Ralph Venables, attempted to catalogue all jazz artists in alphabetical order in the publication Jazz Directory. The first volume was published in 1949, and after several subsequent volumes, the editors found that so much had happened in the intervening years that they needed to revise the volumes already in print before continuing. Because of the size of this task, McCarthy's discography was never completed, though he worked on it for over 20 years.\nMcCarthy edited Jazz Monthly magazine (later Jazz and Blues) from 1955 to 1972, then started his own magazine, Mainstream, later in the decade. McCarthy also worked as a record producer for Black Lion, Atlantic, and RCA.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neal Hefti", "response": ["In 1939, while still a junior at North High in Omaha, he got his start in the music industry by writing arrangements of vocal ballads for local Mickey Mouse bands, like the Nat Towles band.

Echols led a band based in Los Angeles starting in 1931, whose membership included Babe Carter, Herman Pettis, , Lawrence Brown, Red Mack, and . The group was revamped in 1932 with Prince remaining and Bumps Myers and Kid Ory joining; soon after Jack McVea, Eddie Beal, Buddy Banks, and  were added to the lineup. Echols left this ensemble and Flennoy became its leader in 1934; Echols then formed a new group with Red Mack, Andy Blakeney, Paul Howard, Johnny Miller, and Lionel Hampton, which played at Los Angeles's Cotton Club. Echols then retook leadership of the previous ensemble in 1935, again with an altered lineup - McVea remained with the group, and Buck Clayton, Tyree Glenn, Don Byas, and Herschel Evans all played with it. Later in the 1930s, he led yet another band which included Ernie Royal, Al Morgan, and Lee Young, alongside Bumps Myers and Paul Howard. By the early 1940s he appears to have left music. Because he never recorded, his bands were never heralded by later jazz scholars and critics, but \"many of the musicians who played in bands led by Echols recalled it with great affection and admiration\"."]}, {"page": "Billy Burns (trombonist)", "response": ["*Albert McCarthy, Big Band Jazz, Putnam, 1974."]}, {"page": "Jazz Information", "response": [":: \"Report From Abroad,\" by Albert McCarthy"]}, {"page": "Albert J.
