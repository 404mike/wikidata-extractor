Newton was drunk, and Palmer himself interfered with the examination, bumping into Newton and taking the stomach contents off in a jar for 'safe keeping'. The jars were sent off to Alfred Swaine Taylor, who complained that such poor quality samples were of no use to him, and a second post-mortem took place on 29 November. Postmaster Samuel Cheshire intercepted letters addressed to the coroner on behalf of Palmer; Cheshire was later prosecuted for interfering with the mail and given two years in prison. Palmer also wrote to the coroner himself, requesting that the verdict of death be given as natural causes, enclosing in his letter a \u00a310 note.", "* The prosecution witnesses, including Alfred Swaine Taylor, stated the cause of death as 'tetanus due to strychnine'."]}, {"page": "Erethism", "response": ["The first description of symptoms of mercury poisoning among hatters appears to have been made in St Petersburg, Russia, in 1829. In the United States, a thorough occupational description of mercury poisoning among New Jersey hatters was published locally by Addison Freeman in 1860. Adolph Kussmaul's definitive clinical description of mercury poisoning published in 1861 contained only passing references to hatmakers, including a case originally reported in 1845 of a 15-year-old Parisian girl, the severity of whose tremors following two years of carroting prompted opium treatment.

Almost all had suffered from gout. Evidence of colchicine poisoning was given by toxicologist Alfred Swaine Taylor, the defence being that the poison could not be reliably detected after so long. In summing up, the judge said to the jury: \"Gentlemen, if such a state of things as this were allowed to exist no living person could sit down to a meal in safety\". Wilson was found guilty and sentenced to hang. A crowd of 20,000 turned out to see her execution at Newgate Gaol on 20 October 1862.

The historian and sociologist Jeffrey Weeks considers that the idea of homosexuality was \"extremely undeveloped both in the Metropolitan Police and in high medical and legal circles, suggesting the absence of any clear notion of a homosexual category or of any social awareness of what a homosexual identity might consist\". Such ignorance by the medical profession was seen as proof that such activity was not undertaken in Britain, in contrast to the expertise of French and German doctors. For British medico-jurisprudent works, such as Alfred Swaine Taylor's 1846 work A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence, the act of sodomy was linked to bestiality, and described as \"the unnatural connection of a man with a man or with an animal.
