While working with Milt Buckner\u2019s group, Watkins felt that he wasn\u2019t integrated properly into the group with respect to Buckner\u2019s arrangements. He continued recording with notable artists like Thelonious Monk but was not satisfied being a sideman anymore. In July 1954 the Julius Watkins Sextet was born. The team comprised Watkins on French horn, Frank Foster on tenor saxophone, Perry Lopez on guitar, Oscar Pettiford on bass, Kenny Clarke on drums and George Butcher on piano. Together the sextet recorded nine tracks on two albums. Watkins himself wrote six original compositions featured on those albums."]}, {"page": "Butcher, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Butcher"]}]}}
