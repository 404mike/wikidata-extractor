Hancock decoyed a number of smugglers off shore by disguising his ship as an American. He captured one cutter, which he used as a tender. He then sailed Cruizer and the cutter in the direction he thought most of the smugglers had sailed. Next morning he found four luggers and a cutter within easy reach and proceeded to capture them too. The tender captured two luggers, each with 1000 tubs of geneva, rum, and the like. In all, the haul included 26,000 gallons of spirits and a large quantity of tobacco, plus other contraband. The proceeds amounted to \u00a32236 19s 7d, which the officers and crew shared. Despite this singular success against the smugglers, when Cruiser returned to port Hancock had to turn over command of Cruiser to Commander Pringle Stoddart. Unfortunately for Hancock, the battle of Trafalgar had taken place a few months earlier. The battle had resulted on 21 January in a great many promotions in Admiral Lord Nelson's fleet, with a number of the beneficiaries displacing Hancock in the list of candidates for promotion."]}, {"page": "Margaret Stoddart", "response": ["Stoddart was born in Diamond Harbour, Canterbury, New Zealand in 1865, one of six children born to Mark Pringle Stoddart (1819-1885) and Anna Barbara (n\u00e9e Schjott).

Under Cadogan Pallas participated in the evacuation of the British force after the failure of the Walcheren Campaign, with Pallas assembling and embarking the rearguard of the army. In May 1810 Pallas began serving off the coast of Norway under Captain James Bowen before changing command to Captain Pringle Stoddart, under whom she took two privateers in October, and then finally in November to Captain George Monke. On 13 December the ship's boats took two Danish privateers in Siveragg Fjord. On 18 December Pallas was returning to her base at Leith when her pilot confused the light of a lime kiln on the coast for the Isle of May lighthouse, resulting in Pallas being wrecked near Dunbar.
