Aiming for the creation of a performance as a selfless act of sacrifice, he carried out the second great reform, after Konstantin Stanis\u0142avski's, of the actor's art, and his book Towards a Poor Theatre is still one of the most important textbooks in drama schools the world over.

Among others, Peter Brook, Eugenio Barba, Marketa Kimbrell, Richard Schechner and Andre Gregory have derived inspiration from Grotowski's work. Over the last decade of his life, Grotowski had been investigating the possibility of creating a dramatic structure whose effect would be similar to that of a religious ceremony.

This last production was the first complete realization of Grotowski's notion of \"poor theatre.\" In it the company of actors (representing concentration camp prisoners) build the structure of a crematorium around the audience while acting out stories from the Bible and Greek mythology.  This conceptualization had particular resonance for the audiences in Opole, as the Auschwitz concentration camp was only sixty miles away. Akropolis received much attention and could be said to have launched Grotowski's career internationally due to inventive and aggressive promotion by visiting foreign scholars and theatre professionals. A film of the production was made with an introduction by Peter Brook, which constitutes one of the most accessible and concrete records of Grotowski's work.", "The year 1968 marked Grotowski's debut in the West.  His company performed the Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski play Akropolis/Acropolis (1964) at the Edinburgh Festival. This was a fitting vehicle for Grotowski and his poor theatre because his treatment of the play in Poland had already achieved wider recognition and was published in Pami\u0119tnik Teatralny (Warsaw, 1964), Alla Ricerca del Teatro Perduto (Padova, 1965), and Tulane Drama Review (New Orleans, 1965). It marked the first time many in Britain had been exposed to \"poor theatre\". The same year, his book titled Towards a Poor Theatre appeared in Danish, published by Odin Teatrets Forlag. It appeared in English the following year, published by Methuen and Co. Ltd., with an Introduction by Peter Brook, then an Associate Director at the Royal Shakespeare Company. In it he writes feelingly about Grotowski's private consulting for the Company; he/they felt Grotowski's work was unique but equally understood that its value was diminished if talked about too much, if faith were broken with the consultant.", "In 1986, Grotowski was invited by Roberto Bacci of the Centro per la Sperimentazione e la Ricerca Teatrale to shift the base of his work to Pontedera, Italy, where he was offered an opportunity to conduct long-term research on performance without the pressure of having to show results until he was ready. Grotowski gladly accepted, taking with him three assistants from Objective Drama research (Richards, Jimenez and Slowiak) to help in founding his Italian Workcenter. Robart also led a work-team in Pontedera for several years, after which time funding cuts necessitated downscaling to a single research group, led by Richards. Grotowski characterized the focus of his attention in his final phase of research as \"art as a vehicle,\" a term coined by Peter Brook.  \"It seems to me,\" Brook said, \"that Grotowski is showing us something which existed in the past but has been forgotten over the centuries; that is that one of the vehicles which allows man to have access to another level of perception is to be found in the art of performance.\" Moreover, it was in 1986 that  Grotowski changed the name of the Italian centre to the Workcenter of Jerzy Grotowski and Thomas Richards, to signal the unique and central place Richards held in his work. Grotowski drove Richards to take on increasingly greater responsibility and leadership in the work, until he was not only the primary doer in the practice of Art as Vehicle, but also its primal leader and \"director\" (if such a term can be accurately used) of the performance structures created around these Afro-Caribbean vibratory songs, most significantly 'Downstairs Action' (filmed by Mercedes Gregory in 1989) and 'Action', on which work began in 1994 and continues to the present. Italian actor Mario Biagini, who joined the Workcenter shortly after its founding, also became a central contributor to this research.

Brook's film starkly divided the critics: Pauline Kael said \"I didn't just dislike this production, I hated it!\" and suggested the alternative title Night of the Living Dead. Yet Robert Hatch in The Nation thought it as \"excellent a filming of the play as one can expect\" and Vincent Canby in The New York Times called it \"an exalting Lear, full of exquisite terror\". The film drew on the ideas of Jan Kott, in particular his observation that King Lear was the precursor of absurdist theatre, and that it has parallels with Beckett's Endgame. Critics who dislike the film particularly draw attention to its bleak nature from its opening: complaining that the world of the play does not deteriorate with Lear's suffering, but commences dark, colourless and wintry, leaving, according to Douglas Brode, \"Lear, the land, and us with nowhere to go\". Cruelty pervades the film, which does not distinguish between the violence of ostensibly good and evil characters, presenting both savagely. Paul Scofield, as Lear, eschews sentimentality: This demanding old man with a coterie of unruly knights provokes audience sympathy for the daughters in the early scenes, and his presentation explicitly rejects the tradition of playing Lear as \"poor old white-haired patriarch\"."]}, {"page": "Measure for Measure", "response": ["Notable 20th century productions of Measure for Measure include Charles Laughton as Angelo at the Old Vic Theatre in 1933, and Peter Brook's 1950 staging at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre with John Gielgud as Angelo and Barbara Jefford as Isabella.

After a West End run of 329 performances they took the play to Broadway in 1954, where Lunt directed as well as starring. The piece ran for 159 performances; it could have profitably run for longer, but the Lunts chose to close in March 1955.Day, p. 564 Their last Broadway premiere was in Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse's \"melodramatic comedy\" The Great Sebastians in 1956. After a six-month run in New York they toured the piece throughout the US. Their final production was in 1957: The Visit, Maurice Valency's adaptation of Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt's Der Besuch der alten Dame, in which a rich old woman exacts a terrible revenge on the man who betrayed her fifty years earlier. They toured the play in Britain in 1957\u201358, initially under the title Time and Again, in a production directed by Peter Brook. In May 1958 they opened the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in New York with the same play (by then renamed The Visit) and toured it in the US.

He and the novelist and playwright J. B. Priestley had been friends for many years, and they agreed to collaborate on an opera, despite their lack of any operatic experience. Priestley's libretto was based on a legend that \"the pagan deities, robbed of their divinity, became a troupe of itinerant players, wandering down the centuries\".Priestley, J. B. \"My Friend Bliss\", The Musical Times, August 1971, pp. 740\u2013741, accessed 22 March 2011  The opera portrays the confusion that results when the actors unexpectedly find themselves restored to deity. The opera opened the 1949\u201350 Covent Garden season. It was directed by Peter Brook, with choreography by Frederick Ashton. The doyen of English music critics, Ernest Newman,Herbage, Julian. Shostakovitch's Eighth Symphony\", The Musical Times, July 1944, p. 201  praised it highly: \"here is a composer with real talent for opera ... in Mr. Priestley he has been fortunate enough to find an English Boito\", but generally it received a polite rather than a rapturous reception. Priestley attributed this to the failure of the conductor, Karl Rankl to learn the music or to cooperate with Brook, and to lack of rehearsal of the last act. The critics attributed it to Priestley's inexperience as an opera librettist, and to the occasional lack of \"the soaring tune for the human voice\" in Bliss's music.\"The Royal Opera \u2013 'The Olympians'\", The Times, 30 September 1949, p. 6; Hope-Wallace, Philip, \"The Olympians\", The Manchester Guardian, 30 September 1949, p. 5; and Blom, Eric, \"Priestley for Bliss\", The Observer 2 October 1949, p. 6 After the Covent Garden run of ten performances,Haltrecht, p. 132 the company presented the work in Manchester,\"Palace Theatre \u2013 'The Olympians'\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 March 1950, p. 5 but did not revive it in subsequent years; it received a concert performance and broadcast in 1972.Greenfield, Edward. \"The Olympians on Radio 3\", The Guardian, 22 February 1972, p. 10"]}, {"page": "Truman Capote", "response": ["* House of Flowers (1954) Columbia 2320.
