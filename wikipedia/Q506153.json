In 2001, he finished 4th on the Challenge Tour Rankings to earn his card on the top level European Tour. In late 2001, in one of his first tournaments as a full member of the European Tour he finished 6th at the Omega Hong Kong Open. However, he failed to build on that start and had to regain his card via qualifying school at the end of the 2002.\nMarshall maintained his playing status through the end of the 2007 season, with a best end of season ranking of 73rd on the Order of Merit in 2006, and best tournament results of runner-up at the 2003 Madeira Island Open and the 2006 Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles. In 2007, he slipped down the rankings and had to drop down to the Challenge Tour for 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games", "response": ["Athletes and coaches such as Lleyton Hewitt and his coach Roger Rasheed (tennis); Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle and Andrew Marshall (golf), Mick O'Dwyer (Gaelic football) and Brian Kerr (soccer) met and encouraged athletes at events during the games."]}, {"page": "Paul Casey", "response": ["| Andrew Marshall,  S\u00f8ren Hansen"]}, {"page": "Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles", "response": ["| 2006 ||  Paul Casey (2) || align=center|276 || align=center|\u221216 || 1 stroke ||  S\u00f8ren Hansen Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Ferrie", "response": ["| Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Bradley Dredge", "response": ["| Fredrik Andersson,  Brian Davis, Andrew Marshall", "| Fredrik Andersson,  Brian Davis, Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Madeira Islands Open", "response": ["| 2003 || CHA, EUR ||  Bradley Dredge || align=center|272 || align=center|\u221216 || 8 strokes ||  Fredrik Andersson Brian Davis Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Austrian Open (golf)", "response": ["| 2001 || CHA ||  Chris Gane || align=center|270 || align=center|\u221218 || 1 stroke ||  Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "2006 Open Championship", "response": [":Formby: Andrew Marshall, Darren Parris, Jim Payne"]}, {"page": "List of male golfers", "response": ["| Andrew Marshall||1973\u2013"]}, {"page": "Andrew Marshall", "response": ["Andrew Marshall may refer to:", "*Andrew Marshall (screenwriter) (born 1954), British comedy screenwriter", "*Andrew Marshall (journalist), British journalist and radio presenter", "*Andrew Marshall (Asia journalist) (born 1967), British journalist specialising in South East Asia", "*Andrew Marshall (American football) (1879\u20131965), American football player", "*Andrew Marshall (Canadian football) (born 1990), Canadian football player", "*Andrew Marshall (golfer) (born 1973), English professional golfer", "*Andrew Marshall (soccer) (born 1984), American footballer", "*Andrew Marshall (foreign policy strategist) (1921\u20132019), American foreign policy strategist"]}, {"page": "2005 Open Championship", "response": [":Scotscraig: Andrew Marshall, Lloyd Saltman (a), Murray Urquhart"]}, {"page": "Chris Gane", "response": ["| Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Zane Scotland", "response": ["| Jamie Elson,  Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Andrew Marshall (Golfer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Marshall (golfer)"]}, {"page": "2001 Challenge Tour", "response": ["|align=center|4 || Andrew Marshall || || align=center|75,841"]}, {"page": "2011 European Tour Qualifying School graduates", "response": ["|T30|| Andrew Marshall||211||110||", "| align=left|  Andrew Marshall || 18 || 12 ||  || 132 || 146,459"]}, {"page": "2015 PGA EuroPro Tour", "response": ["| Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Challenge Total Fina Elf", "response": ["| 2001 || Kenneth Ferrie ||  || align=center|268 || align=center|\u221220 || 1 stroke ||  Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "2017 MENA Golf Tour", "response": ["|Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "2016 MENA Golf Tour", "response": ["| Andrew Marshall (1)", "| Andrew Marshall (2)", "|Andrew Marshall"]}, {"page": "Berkshire Trophy", "response": ["| 1994 || James KnightAndrew Marshall ||  || 274 (tie)"]}]}}
