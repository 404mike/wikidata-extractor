He was elected Member of Parliament for Bermondsey in a 1909 by-election, but weeks later lost the seat to the Liberals at the January 1910 General Election.\nDumphreys was born in Bermondsey in 1844. Of humble origins, he worked as a journeyman leather dresser. He was active in local politics most of his adult life, elected to the Borough Council, the School Board and County Council. He had also stood in Birmingham West in 1885, against Joseph Chamberlain, on a Fair Trade platform. He was something of a rarity, in being a \"Conservative working man.\" In 1907 he became Mayor of Bermondsey. He was a supporter of  Tariff Reform.Aged almost 65, he was selected as Conservative candidate for the by-election caused by the death of the sitting Liberal MP George Joseph Cooper, because Assheton Pownall, the Conservative prospective candidate for the expected General Election, was out of the country. The seat had alternated between Liberal and Conservative in recent elections, although the Liberals had secured a convincing victory in 1906.\nDumphreys was critical of the Liberal government's failure to act on the recommendation of the Poor Law Commission, which had been initiated by the previous Conservative government. In particular, he pressed for wholesale reform of the workhouse system, for better treatment of the deserving poor, and removal of the taint of pauper from children. \"For every child a chance\" was his philosophy.After a good-natured contest, Dumphreys was elected on 28 October 1909 with a majority of 987 votes over the Liberal candidate, Mr. Spencer Leigh Hughes, with the Labour candidate, Dr. Alfred Salter, securing 16% of the vote. However, polling day had been marred by two women attacking polling stations, smashing bottles containing corrosive liquid over ballot boxes, in an attempt to destroy votes. A presiding officer, Mr. Thornley, was badly injured in one of these attacks, and a Liberal agent suffered a severe burn to the neck. The count was delayed while ballot papers were carefully examined, but it was determined that only two votes had been destroyed.Dumphreys had little time to enjoy his victory, or to make much impact in the House of Commons. Parliament was dissolved in December 1909, and in the ensuing General Election, he was beaten by 969 votes in a straight fight by the new Liberal candidate Harold Glanville. Dumphreys thereby became one of the shortest-serving MPs in history. He tried to regain the seat in the December 1910 election, but was defeated by a wider margin, and never stood for Parliament again.\nDumphreys was the last Conservative MP for Bermondsey. His Labour opponent in the by-election, Dr. Alfred Salter eventually won the seat for Labour in 1922, and the seat became a Labour Party stronghold, until another by-election in 1983, when another Liberal candidate by the name of \"Mr. S. Hughes\" scored a notable victory.\nDumphreys died at Manor Park, Essex (now Greater London), in 1925, aged 80.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|John Dumphreys"]}, {"page": "Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|1909 by-election || John Dumphreys || Conservative"]}, {"page": "Alfred Salter", "response": ["In October 1909 George Cooper MP died.

It was the only by-election to take place between the speech made by Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, at Limehouse on 30 July 1909 and the January 1910 general election and was therefore seen as a commentary on the economic policies of the government against the background of the People's Budget. The Conservatives campaigned against the radicalism of the Liberals and their idea of massive state intervention in welfare. Hughes and the local Liberals embraced this New Liberal approach but the left-wing vote was split between Hughes and the Labour candidate Dr Alfred Salter. Salter was Progressive Party member of the London County Council for Bermondsey, having replaced George Cooper in representing the seat, and was therefore regarded as a Liberal. The Bermondsey Liberals considered adopting Salter as their candidate for the by-election but thought him too advanced politically and by 1909 Salter had become increasingly associated with the Independent Labour Party. Salter was to become the Labour candidate in the election, presenting himself as the true heir to George Cooper's legacy, he strongly supported the anti-poverty message of Lloyd George's budget and split the progressive vote.  Hughes also struggled as a candidate not previously associated with Bermondsey whereas Salter could properly portray himself as Cooper's successor. All this allowed the Tory candidate John Dumphreys to top the poll and win by a majority of 987 votes."]}, {"page": "Alice Chapin", "response": ["Chapin was also a militant suffragette within the Women's Freedom League, and she was sentenced to jail in 1911.
