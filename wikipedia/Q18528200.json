It was a collaboration between English and Italian poets and contained poems in English, Italian, and French. The name is taken from the Florentine Accademia della Crusca, an organization founded in 1583 to \"purify\" the Italian language. Bertie Greatheed's \"The Dream\" opens the collection with an indictment of the current deplorable state of poetry and calls for a return to a Miltonic style. The call to the past was made even more clear by the inclusion of translations of poems by Dante and Petrarch. Hester Thrale Piozzi's preface is more modest: \"we wrote [these poems] to divert ourselves, and to say kind things of each other; we collected them that our reciprocal expressions of kindness might not be lost, and we printed them because we had no reason to be ashamed of our mutual partiality.\"English Poetry 1579-1830: Spenser and the Tradition William Parsons, a travelling Briton, was also of the circle. Merry returned to the UK in 1787 and published \"Adieu and Recall to Love\" in The World under the name of \"Della Crusca\". He was answered by Hannah Cowley's \"The Pen,\" published two weeks later under the name of \"Anna Matilda,\" their literary flirtation played out in the pages of the journal, and the Della Cruscan phenomenon spread to England. The highly successful The Poetry of the World (1788), a collection of the poetic dialogue between \"Anna Matilda\" and \"Della Crusca,\" followed shortly and went through several editions. Other members of the English Della Cruscan circle were \"Laura Maria\" (Mary Robinson), \"Benedict\" (Edward Jerningham), \"Reuben\" (Greatheed), Frederick Pilon, and others."]}, {"page": "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard", "response": ["A shift in context was the obvious starting point in many of these works and, where sufficiently original, contributed to the author's own literary fortunes. This was the case with Edward Jerningham's The Nunnery: an elegy in imitation of the Elegy in a Churchyard, published in 1762. Profiting by its success, Jerningham followed it up in successive years with other poems on the theme of nuns, in which the connection with Gray's work, though less close, was maintained in theme, form and emotional tone: The Magdalens: An Elegy (1763); The Nun: an elegy (1764); and \u201cAn Elegy Written Among the Ruins of an Abbey\u201d (1765), which is derivative of the earlier poems on ruins by Moore and Cunningham. At the opposite extreme, Gray's poem provided a format for a surprising number that purport to be personal descriptions of life in gaol, starting with An elegy in imitation of Gray, written in the King's Bench Prison by a minor (London 1790),Northup item 918 which is close in title to William Thomas Moncrieff\u2019s later \"Prison Thoughts: An elegy, written in the King's Bench Prison\", dating from 1816 and printed in 1821. In 1809, H. P. Houghton wrote An evening's contemplation in a French prison, being a humble imitation of Gray's Elegy while he was a prisoner at Arras during the Napoleonic wars (London 1809).Northup item 940 It was followed next year by the bitter Elegy in Newgate, published in The Satirist in the character of the recently imprisoned William Cobbett.Aug. 1, 1810, pp. 159\u201364"]}, {"page": "Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey", "response": ["* 1796.

Its retrospective mood draws on a particularly 18th century emotional sensibility also found in Edward Jerningham's description of the ruins, with their natural adornments of moss and 'flow'rets', and reflected in J. M. W. Turner's watercolour of them. Wordsworth's preference in his poem is for the broader picture rather than human detail, but otherwise it fits seamlessly within its contemporary literary and aesthetic context."]}, {"page": "1775 in poetry", "response": ["* Edward Jerningham, The Fall of Mexico"]}, {"page": "1773 in poetry", "response": ["* Edward Jerningham, Faldoni and Teresa"]}, {"page": "1765 in poetry", "response": ["* Edward Jerningham, An Elegy Written Among the Ruins of an Abbey"]}, {"page": "1764 in poetry", "response": ["* Edward Jerningham, The Nun"]}, {"page": "1762 in poetry", "response": ["* Edward Jerningham, The Nunnery: An elegy in imitation of the Elegy in a Churchyard, an imitation of Thomas Gray"]}, {"page": "1761 in poetry", "response": ["* Edward Jerningham, Andromache to Pyrrhus: An heroick epistle"]}, {"page": "Sir John Eliot, 1st Baronet", "response": ["He lived in Great Marlborough Street, London.
