Edgar Froese's guitar style was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, while Christopher Franke contributed the more avant garde elements of Karlheinz Stockhausen and Terry Riley. Yes-like progressive rock influence was brought in by Steve Jolliffe on Cyclone. The sample-based sound collages of Johannes Schmoelling drew their inspiration from a number of sources; one instance is Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians on parts of Logos Live, and the track \"Love on a Real Train\" from the Risky Business soundtrack.", "* Steve Jolliffe \u2013 saxophone, keyboards, flute ", "* Steve Jolliffe \u2013 saxophone, flute, keyboards", "* Steve Jolliffe \u2013 saxophone, flute, keyboards", "  bar:SteveJ text:Steve Jolliffe"]}, {"page": "Glastonbury Festival", "response": ["|Ian Dury, Joan Baez, The Waterboys, Fela Kuti, General Public, Dr. John, Fairport Convention, Christy Moore, Brass Construction, The Staple Singers, Billy Bragg, Amazulu, Paul Brady, Steve Jolliffe, The Band billed, but did not appear.
