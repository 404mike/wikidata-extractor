In mid-August, Alliss was included in a group of 17 from which the Ryder Cup team would be chosen. The PGA arranged a series of trial matches at Wentworth starting on 23 September, and Alliss performed well enough that he was included in the team which was announced on 26 September. Alliss was just 22 years old, the second youngest British Ryder Cup player at that time, a few months older than Henry Cotton in 1929. Alliss was paired with Harry Weetman in the opening day foursomes but lost 2&1. Late on the final day, all matches had been completed except for the two singles matches involving Alliss against Jim Turnesa and 23-year-old Bernard Hunt against Dave Douglas. The British team needed 1\u00bd points from these two matches to win the Ryder Cup or a point to tie. Alliss had gone 1 up at the 14th but he 3-putted the 15th while Turnesa got down in two from a bunker. Alliss then went out of bounds at the 17th to give Turnesa the lead. Turnesa was in the trees at the last and still short of the green in 3. However, Alliss, just off the green in 2, fluffed his chip, and eventually halved the hole in 6, to guarantee that the USA would retain the Ryder Cup. In the final match, at the 18th, Bernard Hunt missed a 4-foot putt that he needed to hole to win his match and so the USA won 6\u00bd to 5\u00bd."]}, {"page": "Neil Coles", "response": ["| Tommy Horton,  Harry Weetman"]}, {"page": "World Cup (men's golf)", "response": ["|1960||||Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead||Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland|| \u2013 Bernard Hunt and Harry Weetman"]}, {"page": "Irish Open (golf)", "response": ["The event was not held in 1951 or 1952 but was held again in 1953 at Belvoir Park.
