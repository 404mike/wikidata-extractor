Full-back Harry Hooper joined for \u00a310 from Brierley Hill Alliance, while centre-forward John Horton was brought in from Wombwell. A few months into the campaign, centre-half Ted Hough was signed from Talbot Stead Tubeworks, who were paid \u00a3200 and 52 pints of beer for his services. In January 1922, Sammy Meston \u2013 the son of former Southampton half-back Samuel Meston \u2013 joined from Sholing Athletic, and outside-right Robert Blyth signed from Portsmouth. In March, the club released two popular players to recently promoted First Division club Birmingham, who provided two of their own players in return. McIntyre's contributions were outside-left Fred Foxall and outside-right Joe Barratt, both of whom had played the majority of games up to that point, while their replacements were inside-left Jack Elkes and half-back George Getgood. Foxall had originally attempted to join top-flight side Aston Villa in May, but his transfer was reversed by the Football Association as Southampton had not given permission for the sale (he was also ordered to donate his signing-on fee to the National War Fund).", "!scope=\"row\"|John Horton", "Outside of the league and the FA Cup, Southampton played five additional first-team matches. The first was a friendly match at home to local rivals Portsmouth on 20 October 1921, which served as a benefit match for club secretary Ernest Arnfield. The Saints won the game 4\u20130, with all four goals coming in the second half \u2013 Arthur Dominy \"walked the ball into the net\" for the first, John Horton headed in a cross from Fred Foxall for the second, Foxall \"completed a solo run\" for the third, and Horton scored a second near the end of the game.

Len Butt left around the same time, joining local Southern League club Boscombe. Centre-forward John Horton, who had managed just one appearance in his first season with the Saints before breaking his leg, was forced to retire from professional football. Prior to the start of the 1922\u201323 campaign, Southampton manager Jimmy McIntyre brought in two new signings to the club.
