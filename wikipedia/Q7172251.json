Although he created a wide variety of games, the code for all of them tended to be characterized by an outline-style organization that made it easy to discern the basics of how the program worked. His prose showed a passionate interest in, and enjoyment of, the games he created; he tended to be imaginative, witty, and dramatic, as well as nostalgic - he had little use for graphics, favoring text games that let the programmer's and player's imaginations do the work of creating the setting."]}, {"page": "Blondel (musical)", "response": ["Blondel opened in London on 2 November 1983 and played in two different theatres in the West End, eventually closing after less than two years.
