Flamboyant, charismatic, and energetic, Arthur used his prominent American and European financial connections to fund numerous business ventures, most of which were overly ambitious and ultimately failed.  A proponent of economic advancement in what became known as the New South, Arthur played a primary role in the development of the Cumberland Gap area, and in the course of his endeavors established the cities of Middlesboro, Kentucky and Harrogate, Tennessee.  The community of Arthur, Tennessee, is named for him.After spending his early life migrating back and forth between Scotland, Canada, and Scandinavia, Arthur moved to Boston in 1879, and accepted a position as the general manager of the Scottish-Carolina Timber and Land Company's American operations.  In the early 1880s, Arthur identified a rich stand of timber in the upper Blue Ridge Mountains along the Tennessee-North Carolina border, and devised a boom system to extract the timber from the difficult mountain terrain.   Later in the same decade, Arthur identified the abundant iron ore deposits in the Cumberland Gap region, and established a multimillion-dollar iron production operation in hopes of making Middlesboro the \"Pittsburgh of the South.\"While he never experienced great financial success, Arthur's endeavors were a harbinger of the great logging and mining operations that became major economic forces in Southern Appalachia in the early 20th century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Claiborne County, Tennessee", "response": ["The Four Seasons Hotel was built on the location of present-day Lincoln Memorial University in 1892 by an English land company, the American Association Limited, which was led locally by flamboyant businessman Alexander Arthur.  At the time, it was reported by its promoters to be the largest hotel in the United States.  The main building was four stories high with a lobby 75 feet square and a dining room 50 feet by 160 feet.  It was reported to contain 700 rooms.  Also included in the complex were a hospital, an inn, a sanitarium, and other smaller buildings.  The hotel was not a success and was demolished in 1895.  During its operation, the Four Seasons Hotel offered buggy rides to nearby English Cave, which had been improved with wooden stairways, walkways, and bridges.  The rotting remains of these wooden structures can still be seen in the cave.Larry E.

Having settled in Knoxville, Tennessee, he arranged development projects in the area as part of the post-war New South. Taking an interest in the iron deposits around the Cumberland Gap around 1886, Arthur was able to convince some of the wealthy scions of Gilded-Age Asheville, North Carolina, to talk to their families about funding a \"Pittsburgh of the South\", but sufficient financing was not forthcoming. He then traveled to England, where he was able to find interested backers for his \"Magic City\" of 250,000 residents enjoying running water, electricity, a large sporting commons, and electric trams in the middle of Appalachia.WKYT. \"History of Middlesboro, Kentucky \".

Arthur's plan called for the construction of a series of dams and booms which would be used to move logs from the higher elevations downstream using the river's current. The logs would eventually be floated all the way to Knoxville. The operation would be based in Newport, with a sawmill in the higher elevations at Pigeon Valley (now Hartford, Tennessee).", "By the 1890s, the population of Newport had grown to 900. While Alexander Arthur's logging venture failed, industry continued to find its way to the town. In 1895, the A.C.

As timber resources in these regions became exhausted, and as the demand for lumber skyrocketed after the Civil War, entrepreneurs began looking for ways to reach the virgin forests of Southern Appalachia.  The first logging operations in the Smokies, which began in the 1880s, used splash dams or booms to float logs down rivers to lumber mills in nearby cities.  Notable splash dam and boom operations included the English Lumber Company on Little River, the Taylor and Crate operations along Hazel Creek, and the ambitious operations of Alexander Arthur on the Pigeon River.  All three of these operations failed within their first few years, however, after their dams and boom systems were destroyed by floods.Wilma Dykeman, The French Broad (New York: Rinehart, 1955), 167-174.Vic Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont (Knoxville: Olden Press, 1993), 1-3.Oliver, 55-56."]}, {"page": "Lincoln Memorial University", "response": ["In the 1880s, an entrepreneur named Alexander Arthur (1846\u20131912) and several associates established a firm called American Association, Ltd., the primary purpose of which was to develop the iron ore and coal resources of the Cumberland Gap area.  Arthur founded Middlesboro, Kentucky for the company's employees and furnaces, and constructed a railroad line connecting Middlesboro with Knoxville, Tennessee.  Arthur believed Middlesboro would grow into a large industrial city, the so-called \"Pittsburgh of the South.\"  In 1888, he founded the city of Harrogate, which he envisioned would someday be a suburb for Middlesboro's elite.Edgar Holt, Claiborne County (Memphis, Tenn.: Memphis State University Press, 1981), pp. 44\u201349, 73.", "With the help of Howard and Kehr, Myers purchased the Four Seasons property, although the sanitarium building was all that remained of the once lavish hotel.
