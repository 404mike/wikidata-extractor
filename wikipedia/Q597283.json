He was an associate of the Rhymers' Club in London. He edited the magazines The Century Guild Hobby Horse and The Hobby Horse for the Century Guild of Artists, which he founded with fellow architect Arthur Heygate Mackmurdo in 1882.\n\nHorne was closely associated with Arthur Symons and Selwyn Image and their mistress Muriel (Edith) Broadbent. Later in life he settled in Florence, restoring a Renaissance palazzo into which he eventually moved. He first visited Italy in 1889 and kept an illustrated journal of his travels and art and architectural research.  His monograph on Sandro Botticelli from 1908 is still recognised as of exceptional quality and thoroughness.", "link_mentions": {}}}
