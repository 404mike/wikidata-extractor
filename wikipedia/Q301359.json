He was best known as a pioneer in the field of Services Marketing among other titles such as author, professor and consultant.  Lovelock was also known for his excellent case studies.\nChristopher Lovelock attained a PhD from Stanford University, publishing his thesis on the topic of \"Marketing Public Transportation\". Lovelock had earlier graduated with an MBA from Harvard University after arriving in the US in 1967. Lovelock had also obtained a Master of Arts in Economics and a Bachelor of Arts in Communications from the University of Edinburgh.\nLovelock embarked on his academic career serving, most significantly, on the faculty of the Harvard Business School (USA) for 11 years in addition to other academic appointments at distinguished institutions to include University of California Berkeley (USA), Stanford University (USA) and the MIT Sloan School of Management (USA). Lovelock\u2019s other visiting appointments include those at IMD (Switzerland), INSEAD (France) and University of Queensland (Australia). In total, Lovelock had taught in over 30 countries in every continent except Antarctica.\nBesides that of his teaching appointments, Christopher Lovelock was also an author or co-author of numerous books, articles and teaching cases. Lovelock\u2019s last academic publication, \"Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy 6th edition,\" co-authored together with Jochen Wirtz, has been translated into ten languages. Other books include \"Product Plus\", \"Marketing Challenges\" and \"Public and Nonprofit Marketing\" (the latter two co-authored with Charles Weinberg).\nLovelock\u2019s 60 odd articles were also internationally acclaimed. His paper, \"Whither Services Marketing? In Search of a New Paradigm and Fresh Perspectives\" co-written with Evert Gummesson won the Best Services Article Award in the American Marketing Association and was a finalist for the IBM award for the best article in the Journal of Service Research. For that and other recognitions, Christopher Lovelock was honoured with the prestigious American Marketing Association\u2019s Award for Career Contributions in the Services Discipline.\nThe 100 or more teaching cases he wrote were also much heralded. Twice, he won top honours in the BusinessWeek \"European Case of The Year\" awards. Famous series include Southwest Airlines and FedEx. The latter, written in the 1970s, gained FedEx the wide exposure of potential clients, indirectly contributing to FedEx\u2019s success today. His teaching cases, revered for their acute insights into marketing challenges, retain their positions on bestsellers\u2019 lists more than a quarter of a century after they were published, displaying a strong relevance even in today\u2019s context.\nMoving to Eastham, Cape Cod, in 1990, Christopher Lovelock became actively involved with his adopted community. Lending his expertise in areas like education, health care, environmental conservation and regional transportation, he became an advocate for a variety of issues such as summer traffic to underground utility lines. Most of these can be traced back to pieces found in the Cape Cod Times for which he was an Op Ed or his advisory position for various local organizations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Outline of marketing", "response": ["* Christopher Lovelock (1940-2008) - author of many books and articles on services marketing"]}, {"page": "History of marketing", "response": ["* Christopher Lovelock (1940-2008) - author of many books and articles on services marketing"]}, {"page": "Lovelock (surname)", "response": ["*Christopher Lovelock (1940\u20132008), British academic"]}, {"page": "Lovelock, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Lovelock"]}]}}
