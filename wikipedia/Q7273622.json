Following active service in the RAF during the Second World War, he qualified as a teacher.He was an advocate of the abolition of corporal punishment and he endeavoured to promote a progressive curriculum in secondary schools. Mackenzie published his opinions in a series of books in which he challenged the dominance of exams and a utilitarian educational ethos.\nRF Mackenzie wrote and published three books, often referred to as 'the trilogy', while he was headteacher at Braehead Junior Secondary School in Buckhaven.:\u200a321\u200a\nA Question of Living, published in 1963\nEscape from the Classroom, published in 1965 - Introduction by Gavin Maxwell\nThe Sins of the Children, published in 1967In April 1974 he was dismissed from his headteacher post in Summerhill Academy in Aberdeen following public criticism of his liberal approach to school discipline, particularly his ban on corporal punishment of girls in the school.:\u200a513\u20134\u200a RF Mackenzie wrote his own story of the events at Summerhill Academy, which led to his dismissal as headteacher. The 'Unbowed Head', gives a remarkable insight into staff, pupils, administrators and politicians at that time.\n4.

His family maintained Summerhill, with Neill's daughter as its headmaster . Others influenced by Neill included John Aitkenhead, Michael Duane, and R. F. Mackenzie. Richard Bailey wrote that Maria Montessori and Rudolf Steiner's followers were more evangelical in character, and that Neill deterred would-be devotees. He specifically discouraged American association with his school in both name and likeness. By 1972, Ray Hemmings wrote that Neill's ideas were misinterpreted in the hands of other schools. Hemmings found Neill to have moderate influence on state schools in areas such as teacher\u2013student interactions. Neill's views on sexuality and non-compulsory lessons did not have widespread acceptance. Herb Snitzer said that Neill \"influenced thousand of teachers\". Both George Dennison and Bailey felt Neill's influence to not be easily measurable, with Dennison adding that non-Summerhill schools continue to adopt Neillian thought."]}, {"page": "R F Mackenzie", "response": ["#REDIRECT R.
