He was best known for creating the German Reed Entertainments, together with his actress wife, a genre of musical plays that made theatre-going respectable at a time when the stage was considered disreputable.\nWhile acting as organist and chapel-master at chapels in London, and also as musical director and performer at West End theatres in the 1830s and 1840s, Reed tried his hand at producing opera.  He married Priscilla Horton, a noted singer, actress and dancer, in 1844.  By 1851, he was managing opera productions at various theatres in London and on tour.   In 1855, Reed and his wife began to present and perform in \"Mr. and Mrs. German Reed's Entertainments\", consisting of brief, small-scale, family-friendly comic operas. In the early and mid-Victorian era, the respectable middle classes regarded the theatre in general as sinful.  Therefore, the Reeds shrewdly called their establishment the \"Gallery of Illustration\" and their productions \"entertainments\" to emphasize their refined propriety.\nIn addition to comic classics like The Beggar's Opera, the Reeds usually presented new works by English writers such as F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert, William Brough and Gilbert \u00e0 Beckett.  His composers included Frederic Clay, Arthur Sullivan, George Macfarren and Alfred Cellier, as well as himself. Reed retired in 1871 after an injury, and his son Alfred took over the entertainments with his mother.", "link_mentions": {}}}
