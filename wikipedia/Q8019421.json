His approach is constantly evolving; redefining and reinterpreting classic subject matter, such as landscapes, still lifes and portraits, in methods that challenge historical traditions and vary between bodies of work. Since the 1950s, Tillyer has exhibited internationally, and his work can be found in the collections of major institutions including the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Brooklyn Art Museum, the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), Tate Britain and the Victoria and Albert Museum. There are at least 15 works by Tillyer in the Tate collection, including High Force (1974).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*William Tillyer (born 1938)"]}, {"page": "List of modern artists", "response": ["* William Tillyer"]}, {"page": "List of contemporary artists", "response": ["* William Tillyer (born 1938), painter, printmaker, watercolorist"]}, {"page": "Ikon Gallery", "response": ["During the next 6 years, Ikon became positioned as one of the most important contemporary art galleries outside London, attracting both exhibitors and visitors from far beyond the city.
