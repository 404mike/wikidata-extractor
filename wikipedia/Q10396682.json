Everiss led Albion to the League Title in the 1919-20 season, and to the FA Cup in 1931.\nEveriss joined Albion's office staff in 1896. He was appointed secretary-manager in 1902, a post he would hold until 1948. His 46 years in the job technically make him English football's longest-serving manager of all time, although much of his combined role was administrative, and the job of picking the team was left to the directors. Indeed, Albion did not create the full-time post of 'manager' until Everiss left his position. He was made a director upon his retirement in 1948 but died three years later in 1951 at the age of 68.Everiss' son Alan joined the Albion staff in 1933. He was associated with the club for 66 years, serving as clerk, assistant-secretary, secretary, director and life member.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
