His loan was curtailed after only one more match, when he damaged ankle ligaments and was sidelined for a month. Allen returned from the injury in December, entering the Swansea squad at home to Barnsley after regular midfielder Ferrie Bodde had been ruled out for the remainder of the season due to injury. With Swansea 2\u20130 down and playing poorly, manager Mart\u00ednez was prompted to bring Allen on from the substitutes' bench. The club went on to earn a late 2\u20132 draw and despite only playing 25 minutes, Allen once more received the man of the match award. On 5 April 2009, Allen came on as a 68th-minute substitute for Mark Gower, and 20 minutes later scored his first goal for Swansea in a South Wales derby 2\u20132 draw away at Cardiff City.

Maher claimed that Duguid had cheated by conning the referee due to his over-reacting, and claimed; \"He clipped my leg, so I turned to say 'What are you doing?' and he fell over clutching his face like he'd been poleaxed by Mike Tyson.\" Duguid stated in his defence; \"He chested me and put his face in my face. That's a headbutt, a sending-off offence.\" Mark Gower picked up a yellow card for dissent after arguing with the referee, Steve Bennett, about the sending off. Five minutes later, Gower was booked again, this time for a late challenge on Duguid. Chris Barker was sent-off in the 78th minute, after he was booked twice. Southend appealed against the red card, which was rejected by The Football Association's disciplinary commission."]}]}}
