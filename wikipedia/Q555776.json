He became known as motorsport's first disabled hero and battled considerable adversity (including having his licence revoked) to participate in, and win, some of the most prestigious races of his day. After being discovered and championed by Brian Lister, he enjoyed great success racing Lister Cars, winning the British Empire Trophy in 1957. In his short career, he scored a total of 71 race victories, 15 of which came from international competition. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix on 14 July 1956, scoring no championship points. He also attempted to qualify for the Italian Grand Prix in the same year, but was excluded due to his lack of the required International Licence, his disability precluding the granting of such a licence at the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 19", "response": ["*1958 \u2013 Archie Scott Brown, Scottish race car driver (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "May 13", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 Archie Scott Brown, Scottish race car driver (d. 1958)"]}, {"page": "Silverstone Circuit", "response": ["Matters were somewhat happier for the British enthusiast at the International Trophy; a quality field had been attracted including Fangio and Collins in their Lancia-Ferraris, but the 13 laps of the race were led by the new BRM P25 driven by Hawthorn.
