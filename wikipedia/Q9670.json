She was re-elected in the 2015,  2017 and 2019 general elections, increasing her majority each time.\nBorn in Malvern in Worcestershire, Lucas graduated from the University of Exeter and the University of Kansas before receiving a PhD from the University of Exeter in 1989. She joined the Green Party in 1986 and held various party roles, also serving on Oxfordshire County Council from 1993 to 1997. She was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England in 1999 and re-elected in 2004 and 2009, also serving as the party's Female Principal Speaker from 2003 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2008.\nLucas was elected the first leader of the Green Party in 2008 and was elected to represent the constituency of Brighton Pavilion in the 2010 general election, becoming the party's first MP. She stood down as party leader in 2012 to devote more time to her parliamentary duties and focus on an ultimately successful campaign to be re-elected as an MP. She returned as party leader from September 2016 to September 2018, sharing the post with Jonathan Bartley.\nShe is known as a campaigner and writer on green economics, localisation, alternatives to globalisation, trade justice, animal welfare and food. In her time as a politician and activist, she has worked with non-governmental organisations and think tanks, including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Oxfam.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Rail", "response": ["The Green party has committed to bringing the railways 'back into public ownership' and has maintained this impetus when other parties argued to maintain the status quo.

However, the cost and inconvenience of having two seats is questioned. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the Council of Europe, Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions, with the majority of Parliament's work being carried out there. Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a \"travelling circus\", and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is because the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there, and hence Brussels is treated as the 'capital' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing from numerous figures, including Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, Commission First-Vice President from 2004 to 2010, who stated that \"something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions\". The Green Party has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by Jean Lambert MEP and Caroline Lucas MEP; in addition to the extra 200\u00a0million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268\u00a0tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union. The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m MEP. In August 2014, an assessment by the European Court of Auditors calculated that relocating the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament to Brussels would save \u20ac113.8 million per year. In 2006, there were allegations of irregularities in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented, thus further harming the case for the Strasbourg seat."]}, {"page": "Environmentalist", "response": ["* Caroline Lucas (politician)"]}, {"page": "GCHQ", "response": ["In 2015 there was a complaint by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas that British intelligence services, including GCHQ, had been spying on MPs allegedly \"in defiance of laws prohibiting it.\""]}, {"page": "Politics of the United Kingdom", "response": ["The Green Party of England and Wales kept its sole MP, Caroline Lucas, in the 2019 general election (it previously had an MP in 1992; Cynog Dafis, Ceredigion, who was elected on a joint Plaid Cymru/Green Party ticket).

Three reasons can be found for this. It includes countries with a first past the post electoral system, such as the United Kingdom. However, despite the first past the post system in the United Kingdom, the Green Party of England and Wales won their first seat in the House of Commons when Caroline Lucas won the seat of Brighton Pavilion in 2010. The Scottish Greens have had success in the devolved Scottish Parliament having recently signed a deal to enter a governing coalition, whilst the Green Party Northern Ireland has had success in the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly and local elections where the first-past-the-post system is not used. In countries where a party with similar ideals is stronger, such as Norway and Denmark, Green parties tend to perform worse. In some Eastern European countries, like Romania, Green parties are still in the process of formation and have therefore not gained enough support. In Poland the Green Party, registered in 2004, won their first three seats in the Sejm in 2019. The Green Party of Bulgaria is a part of the left-wing Coalition for Bulgaria, currently in opposition.

Some politicians, notably including Labour Party MPs Clare Short, Harriet Harman, and Stella Creasy, Liberal Democrats MP Lynne Featherstone, and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, took stances against Page 3 and made efforts to have it removed from newspapers. Meanwhile, The Sun vigorously defended the feature, often responding to criticism with ad hominem attacks. When Short tried in 1986 to introduce a House of Commons bill banning topless models from British newspapers, The Sun ran a \"Stop Crazy Clare\" campaign, distributing free car stickers, calling Short a \"killjoy\", printing unflattering images of her, and polling readers on whether they would prefer to see Short's face or the back of a bus.", "In June 2013, Caroline Lucas defied parliamentary dress code by wearing a \"No More Page Three\" T-shirt during a House of Commons debate on media sexism, during which she stated \"If Page 3 still hasn't been removed from The Sun by the end of this year, I think we should be asking the government to step in and legislate\". Culture minister Ed Vaizey responded that the government did not plan to regulate the content of the press, and later that month, newly appointed Sun editor David Dinsmore confirmed he would continue printing photographs of topless models, calling it \"a good way of selling newspapers\".

Caroline Lucas welcomed the decision to discontinue topless images but criticized the transition to clothed glamour, saying: \"So long as The Sun reserves its right to print the odd topless shot, and reserves its infamous page for girls clad in bikinis, the conversation isn't over\". Others defended the feature and the women who posed for it, with glamour model Nicola McLean telling ITV's Good Morning Britain that: \"[Page 3 models] are all very strong-minded women that have made our own choice and feel very happy with what we are doing. We certainly don't feel like we have been victimised\".
