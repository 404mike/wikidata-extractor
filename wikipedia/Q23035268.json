Non-religious holidays in Dublin - especially tradesmens' days off - were traditionally referred to as a \"Dargle Days\" (from the habit of the Irish upper classes of travelling to the banks of the Dargle to picnic and engage in field sports such as tennis, on such days). The \"Waxie's Dargle\", on the other hand, is a humorous reference to the annual outing of the Dublin shoe-makers and repairers (who were known as \"Waxies\", from their habit of periodically running a ball of wax along the string as they stitched) to Irishtown on the River Dodder.Bernard Share: Slanguage, A Dictionary of Irish Slang.

The Irish Times reviewer Bernard Share claimed the work was \"the most important Irish novel since Ulysses.\" Like James Joyce, Brown employed the stream-of-consciousness technique and sought to document Dublin's culture through the use of humour, accurate dialects and intricate character description. Down All the Days was followed by a series of other novels, including A Shadow on Summer (1972), Wild Grow the Lilies (1976) and A Promising Career (published posthumously in 1982). He also published three poetry collections: Come Softly to My Wake, Background Music and Of Snails and Skylarks. All the poems are included in The Collected Poems of Christy Brown."]}, {"page": "Waxies' Dargle", "response": ["The shoe-makers and repairers in Dublin were known as waxies, because they used wax to waterproof and preserve the thread they used in stitching the shoes.Bernard Share: Slanguage, A Dictionary of Irish Slang.
