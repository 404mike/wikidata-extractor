Andreas BlassAndreas R. Blass was the first to point out connections between game semantics and linear logic. This line was further developed by Samson Abramsky, Radhakrishnan Jagadeesan, Pasquale Malacaria and independently Martin Hyland and Luke Ong, who placed special emphasis on compositionality, i.e. the definition of strategies inductively on the syntax. Using game semantics, the authors mentioned above have solved the long-standing problem of defining a fully abstract model for the programming language PCF. Consequently, game semantics has led to fully abstract semantic models for a variety of programming languages, and to new semantic-directed methods of software verification by software model checking."]}, {"page": "School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh", "response": ["* Samson Abramsky , computer scientist at the University of Oxford"]}, {"page": "Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science", "response": ["* Samson Abramsky"]}, {"page": "Christopher Strachey", "response": ["The Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford has a Christopher Strachey Professorship of Computing, currently held by Samson Abramsky FRS."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Samson Abramsky (King's), computer scientist"]}, {"page": "BCS Lovelace Medal", "response": ["*2013 Samson Abramsky \u2013 for contributions to domain theory, game semantics and categorical quantum mechanics"]}, {"page": "Yehezkel Abramsky", "response": ["He had four sons including Professor Chimen Abramsky, and was the grandfather of Professor Samson Abramsky and Jenny Abramsky."]}, {"page": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford", "response": ["* Samson Abramsky, Christopher Strachey Professor of Computing"]}, {"page": "BCS-FACS", "response": ["In recent years, a series of evening seminars have been held, mainly at the BCS London office.
