G. Wells, but it was his trilogy entitled A Scots Quair, and in particular its first book Sunset Song, with which he made his mark. A Scots Quair, with its combination of stream-of-consciousness, lyrical use of dialect, and social realism, is considered to be among the defining works of the 20th century Scottish Renaissance. It tells the story of Chris Guthrie, a young woman growing up in the north-east of Scotland in the early 20th century. All three parts of the trilogy have been turned into serials by BBC Scotland, written by Bill Craig, with Vivien Heilbron as Chris. Additionally, Sunset Song has been adapted into a film, released in 2015. Spartacus, a novel set in the famous slave revolt, is his best-known full-length work outside this trilogy."]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Wendy Craig,John Ronane,Barry Keegan,Elizabeth Wallace,Alison Leggatt,John Robinson,Michael Goodliffe,Edward Fox,Vivien Heilbron,Richard Brooke"]}, {"page": "Taggart", "response": ["* Vivien Heilbron (Episode: Gingerbread)"]}, {"page": "Lillian Beckwith", "response": ["*1992 - An Island Apart \u2014 Chapter 1, (audiobook narrated by Vivien HeilbronBBC Audiobooks America )"]}, {"page": "A Scots Quair", "response": ["TV adaptations of all three works were made by the BBC in 1971, 1982 and 1983, respectively.
