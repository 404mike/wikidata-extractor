He scored 2,330 runs with a highest score of 89 and took one wicket with a best performance of one for 12.During World War II Stainton was a Royal Air Force navigator. On 5 July 1944 his Mosquito was shot up over France and limped back on one engine to RAF Ford in Sussex, where it crashed and Stainton was trapped in the cockpit, fearing that the aircraft would explode at any moment. Afterwards he wrote that the only thought in his mind was \"at least I had my cricket\".On leaving Oxford in 1934 Stainton had become a schoolteacher; after the war he went back to teaching and became headmaster of Glengorse School, a preparatory school in Battle, East Sussex.
