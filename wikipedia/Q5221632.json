Kitson commissioned his friend Frank Brangwyn to create the dining room, for which Brangwyn designed the furniture and painted frescos. When Kitson died in 1947, the villa was inherited by his niece Daphne Phelps, who maintained and ran it till her death in 2005. Phelps wrote a memoir entitled A House in Sicily in 1999.
