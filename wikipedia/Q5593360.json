A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan released Allen but he was not quick enough to make something of the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.Macey (2009): p. 188", "| DF ||3 ||\u00a0Graham Williams (c)"]}, {"page": "Phil Dwyer", "response": ["Cardiff started the following season with a 2\u20132 draw with Oldham Athletic with Dwyer scoring his side's equalising goal. Morgan made several signings, including brothers Gary and Dave Bennett and steered the club to ninth place before he was relieved of his role and moved into an administrative position. Dwyer described the move as \"one of the most baffling decisions I ever came across\". The club endured a disastrous run of form under Morgan's replacement, Graham Williams, failing to win a game for more than three months between December 1981 and March 1982. Williams and Morgan were both sacked in March with the club in the relegation zone and were replaced by Len Ashurst. In his first game as a manager, Cardiff won 5\u20134 over Cambridge United. Dwyer played his last game of the season on 27 February in a 2\u20130 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday before succumbing to a knee injury, caused by arthritis brought on by an operation on his cartilage earlier in his career, that ended his campaign. He finished the season having made 28 appearances in all competitions, the lowest tally of his career. In his absence, Cardiff were relegated to the Third Division after losing 3\u20132 to Luton Town in the final match of the season. The club also suffered defeat in the final of the Welsh Cup, losing 2\u20131 to local rivals Swansea City."]}]}}
