David Tibet, a friend of Coil's, formed Current 93; both groups were inspired by amphetamines and LSD. J. G. Thirlwell, a co-producer with Coil, developed a version of black comedy in industrial music, borrowing from lounge as well as noise and film music. In the early 1980s, the Chicago-based record label Wax Trax! and Canada's Nettwerk helped to expand the industrial music genre into the more accessible electro-industrial and industrial rock genres."]}, {"page": "Nothing Records", "response": ["Reznor composed two instrumental pieces for the film under his own name, enlisting Coil's Peter Christopherson to assist on the songs.

He didn't give a fuck about the integrity.\"", "Coil holds a unique place in history of Nothing Records, being one of the first acts to sign to the label, as well as remaining one of the final acts at the end of the label, all the while having released no material during their entire tenure on the roster.  John Balance and Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson founded Coil in 1982 in London, England, after collaborating on a few side projects and following their departure from Psychic TV.   Other collaborators, such as Drew McDowall and Danny Hyde, would frequently record with the band, some becoming members for a time.  By the time Coil arrived at Nothing Records, they had released three studio albums.   Scatology and Horse Rotorvator were released on Force & Form, which was manufactured and distributed by K.422, a sister label of Some Bizzare Records.  Love's Secret Domain was released on Torso in Europe and the seminal Wax Trax! Records in the United States.  These albums has helped establish Coil as one of the premiere acts in experimental and industrial, prior to joining Nothing Records.", "In 1995, Coil began work on their first release for Nothing Records, which they decided would be the Backwards album.  With the Torso demo material already completed, the band decided to head into Reznor's Nothing Studios in New Orleans to re-record the material, as well as write new music.  Recording at Nothing Studios began in June 1995 and was completed by January of 1997.  Trent Reznor did not perform, produce or write any material for it. John Balance recalled, \"We produced it ourselves, with Danny Hyde as engineer and with excellent help, complete co-operation and enormous investment of time, energy and genuine enthusiasm from all the people at Hot Snakes studio (a.k.a. Nothing Studios).  In particular Chris Vrenna, who helped us iron out technical stuff, Brian the studio manager, who kept it running smoothly, and of course Trent himself, who kept out of our way while letting us loose in his secret domain.\"", "During this time, Reznor would once again invite Coil to do a remix for the Nine Inch Nails song \"The Perfect Drug.\"  This time, however, Coil declined to participate, citing lack of time, due to the recording of Backwards.. In spite of this, Peter Christpherson did assist on two Trent Reznor songs; \"Videodrones; Questions\" and \"Driver Down,\" for the soundtrack to David Lynch's Lost Highway, also released on Nothing Records.  Reznor had lobbied for Coil to take on a greater role in composing music for Lynch's films, but Lynch declined.  John Balance recalled, \"You know, with Lost Highway, Trent literally forced (us) down David Lynch's throat, saying 'Look, please put this Coil stuff on.' You know, he really did help to get us on that soundtrack, but he (Lynch) wasn't interested. He wanted David Bowie, he wanted Marilyn Manson, he wanted whomever he could get. He just said, 'These people are really big. I want this film to be really big.' He didn't give a fuck about the integrity.\"", "In addition to the Backwards album, a companion remix album was also once in the plans for release on Nothing Records.  John Balance commented, \"We are planning to involve a whole bunch of people in remixing tracks from our new Nothing album, including Steven Stapleton of Nurse with Wound, Autechre, Charlie Clouser and others we haven't asked yet, so it would be unfair to speculate on.\".  In addition, Nothing also planned to re-issue the first two Coil albums, Scatology and Horse Rotorvator.  However, the rights to these albums became caught up in a dispute between Coil and their former label, Some Bizzare Records.  John Balance recalled in 1999, \"We have no news over Nothing releasing Horse Rotorvator and Scatology, because we gave them it about 5 years ago and had it legally able to be released in the U.S., but Nothing's lawyers were unhappy with a slightly less than watertight legal situation, so didn't go ahead.\"  Balance would go on to claim that Some Bizzare label owner Stephen \"Stevo\" Pearce initially agreed to the Nothing re-issues, before later demanding more money, stating,  \"Since that, that fucking arsehole  Stevo Pearce has reared his very unpleasant head again and asked Nothing for more money and generally thrown a spanner in the works.  He originally gave Coil permission to give it to Nothing as part of a half-hearted attempt to be nice to us and make some amends, including financial, for the terrible way he has continued to treat us over the fate of these two records.  Actaually he wasn't trying to be nice, he was trying to cover his ass for some early crap he tried to pull off.\"", "In 1997, Some Bizzare reissued both albums in the UK, against the wishes of the band.  Coil released a message to fans urging them not to support these reissues, claiming they were unauthorized, due to the fact that Some Bizzare had not settled with them on unpaid royalties for the albums.  John Balance even went as far as cursing the reissues.  In response to the Some Bizzare reissues, Coil remastered and reissued both albums themselves, on their own Threshold House label.  The covers to both albums featured a message to Some Bizzare label owner \"Stevo\" Pearce, stating \"Stevo, pay us what you owe us!\"", "In 2004, after a legal dispute arose between Trent Reznor and Nothing Records president John Malm Jr., Reznor officially declared the label defunct, with no Coil albums having ever seen release on the label.  That same year, John Balance would tragically die in a fall inside of his own home.  Peter Christopherson announced that Coil would not continue as a band.  However, he would focus on the band's back-catalogue, which including revisiting the Nothing Records material."]}, {"page": "Throbbing Gristle", "response": ["P-Orridge and Peter Christopherson went on to form Psychic TV, and Tutti and Chris Carter continued to record together under the names of Chris & Cosey, Carter Tutti and Creative Technology Institute.

TOPY was conceived not as an occult order of teaching, but a forum to facilitate discussions on occult ideas by like-minded people, and from its beginnings was understood by its founders to be a successor to the late 19th and early 20th century Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), especially as the latter had been run under Crowley's leadership. Evans described TOPY as \"a 'fusion' organisation, creating a crossover of punk/experimental music with chaos magical thinking and practice\", making particular use of the sigilisation practices of occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Journalist Gavin Baddeley described TOPY as \"perhaps the most influential new occult order of the 1980s\". P-Orridge had never wanted to be seen as the leader of an occult order, although many of those involved in TOPY were frustrated that outsiders regularly described P-Orridge as the group's leader. Accordingly, P-Orridge separated from TOPY in 1991, although it continued as a fan community after the departure."]}, {"page": "Coil (band)", "response": ["Coil were an experimental music group, founded in 1982 in London, England and concluded in 2005.
