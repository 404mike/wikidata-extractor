He played as a defender.\nGratrix began his professional career with Blackpool as a 20-year-old in September 1952, joining from Manchester side Taylor Bros. He made his debut for Blackpool on 13 March 1954, succeeding Eddie Shimwell in the right-back berth in a goalless draw against Middlesbrough at Bloomfield Road.\nThe following campaign, 1954\u201355, he retained his position, teaming-up with Tommy Garrett, although occasionally being asked to play at left-back.\nIn 1955\u201356, with Harry Johnston leaving to manage Reading, Gratrix moved to centre-half and remained there for the rest of his career.\nAlso during the 1955\u201356 season, Gratrix represented England at \"B\" level, playing against Switzerland at The Dell. England B won 4\u20131.For the 1956\u201357 campaign, Gratrix was an ever-present in Blackpool's 46 league and cup fixtures, helping them to their second consecutive top-four finish in Division One. He repeated the feat  the following season and also in 1961\u201362 (52 league and cup games).\nOn 19 October 1957, Gratrix had the chance to open his scoring account with the club. He took a penalty against Manchester United at Bloomfield Road, but he put it over the bar. He remained without a goal in his 436 games for Blackpool.In 1964, after eleven years and four hundred league appearances for Blackpool, Gratrix was sold to Manchester City. He made fifteen league appearances for City before trying his hand at playing in Canada with Toronto City, where he finally experienced the sweet sensation of scoring a goal (away v Montreal Italica, 4 July 1965). He returned to the United Kingdom to finish his playing career with Welsh club Bangor City.\nGratrix died in 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe Smith (football forward, born 1889)", "response": ["After the war, Smith built a formidable \"M\" forward line of Stan Mortensen, Stanley Matthews and Jackie Mudie. Mortensen and Mudie began their professional careers at the club, whilst Smith signed Matthews from Stoke City for an \u00a311,500 fee in May 1947. Other key signings Smith made during his time at the club include: defender Danny Blair (joined from Aston Villa in 1936), George Farrow (defender signed from Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic for \u00a31,250 in 1936), Scotland winger Alex Munro (signed from Hearts in March 1937 for \u00a33,500), inside-forward Willie Buchan (signed from Celtic for \u00a310,000), defender Eric Hayward (free signing from Port Vale in May 1937), Eddie Shimwell (signed from Sheffield United for \u00a37,000 in December 1946), full-back Jackie Wright (signed from Mossley), goalkeeper George Farm (joined on a free transfer from Hibernian), midfielder Allan Brown (signed from East Fife in December 1950), forward Ernie Taylor (signed from Newcastle United for \u00a325,000 in October 1951), defender Jimmy Kelly (signed from Watford in October 1954 for \u00a315,000), and striker Ray Charnley (signed from Morecambe for a \u00a3750 fee in May 1957). A number of significant players also began their professional careers under Smith, including: Barrie Martin, Ron Suart, Ewan Fenton, Tommy Garrett, Bill Perry, Dave Durie, Roy Gratrix, Brian Peterson, Hughie Kelly, and Jimmy Armfield.

New names emerging in the team at this time included Dave Durie, David Frith and the giant Roy Gratrix. Leaving Bloomfield Road were Len Stephenson and Jackie Wright. The forward line of Taylor, Mortensen, Brown and Perry provided most of the goals, but Matthews was still experiencing niggling injuries, which meant played in only half of the first-team matches.", "The 1955\u201356 season was significant for many reasons; firstly, two of the club's greatest servants, captain Harry Johnston and Stan Mortensen, both departed to face new challenges. Johnston became manager of Reading, while Morty went to Hull City. Their places were filled by Roy Gratrix and Jackie Mudie, who switched to centre-forward, allowing Dave Durie to take over the inside-left position.", "In May and June 1958, Blackpool embarked on a tour of Australia. En route, they stopped in Los Angeles on 29 April to face a Los Angeles All Stars team in Inglewood. The visitors won 13\u20132.

On 10 May they returned to Sydney to face Australia again, before moving on to Wollongong the next day for another game against New South Wales.

Between the age of 13 and 15 he played for Salford Boys. After interest from a number of League clubs, he joined Aston Villa, but homesickness meant he soon returned. A successful trial at Manchester City followed.Schindler, George Best and 21 Others, p. 100. At City, McAlinden was in the same youth team as Mike Doyle and Glyn Pardoe. His sole Manchester City appearance came in a 3\u20132 defeat in the Football League to Preston North End in October 1963, at a time when the Manchester City squad was severely depleted by injury. McAlinden was released by Manchester City at the end of the 1964\u201365 season, upon the expiry of his contract. He then spent the summer in North America at the invitation of Roy Gratrix.Schindler, George Best and 21 Others, p. 174. While in North America McAlinden met Stanley Matthews, who offered him a contract at Port Vale. McAlinden joined the club, but did not progress beyond the reserve team.Schindler, George Best and 21 Others, p. 199."]}]}}
