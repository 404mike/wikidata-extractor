In June, a contract was awarded to F. S. Warner for 939 pounds. The total cost of the facility was 1,764 pounds ($3,528) when completed in 1901 and included quarters for the post mistress, by then, Miss J. Benson. Responsibility for providing the post office buildings until 1901 also rested with the State Government. Accordingly, the design and construction was undertaken by the Public Works Department (PWD) of WA. A common practice, following re-organisation of the Department in 1897, was to facilitate the works by adapting a standard design as necessary, with a site plan specifically addressing the site conditions. There is evidence that this practice was adopted in the case of the South Perth Post Office and Quarters. The standard design apparently adopted for this purpose was PWD Standard Plan Class D. Modifications probably included the substitution of the operating room for a bedroom, with the internal kitchen, pantry and laundry added at the rear. Warwick Broomfield, a reviewer of post office plans in WA suggests: \"...a sheet showing a standard design which is similar to South Perth is ascribed to Hardwick in 1897\". The design style is best categorised as a very simple form of Federation Bungalow as described in, but with no outstanding design elements evident. At present, the location of other buildings to the same or similar plan is not known. In 1900, J. H. Grainger was the Principal Architect, with Hillson Beasley his Chief Draughtsman. Beasley signed the Site Plan on 11 April 1900.", "The South Perth Post Office, constructed in 1901, is located in the early business centre of South Perth and in the vicinity of other significant historic public buildings. Its historical importance, however, can be attributed to it likely being the first post office completed in Western Australia after the federation of the Australian colonies in January 1901, albeit under the aegis of the state government architects John Grainger (Chief Architect of the PWD) and Hillson Beasley (Chief Draughtsman) of the Public Works Department. It also therefore represents one of the very early contributions of the Western Australian government to the fledgling Commonwealth. South Perth Post Office is also of aesthetic significance due to being one of an important group of heritage buildings including the Old Mill Theatre, Heritage House Cultural Centre, the Police Station and the Windsor Hotel, located on a large street intersection formed by Mill Point Road and Mends Street. The ensemble of buildings and their garden surrounds, as a whole, form an important group with aesthetic characteristics, particularly in the context of the associated dense commercial strip."]}, {"page": "Claremont Post Office", "response": ["The building was upgraded, in 1914, to a design by Hillson Beasley, the then Principal Architect of the PWD. Beasley's design changed the facade of the building considerably by emphasising its Romanesque features with a curved portico and also provided more room inside, with the demolition of some internal wall to accommodate a larger mail room and a bigger public area. The roof was also altered and the original shingles changed to Marseilles tiles. Since 1914, the building has been altered and extended, in the 1950s and the 1980s, to accommodate changing postal requirements and the residential accommodation has been taken over by postal functions, although the form of the rooms remains. Despite these changes, the external form of the 1914 building has changed little and continues to make a strong statement in the Claremont shopping area. In 1982, Australia Post proposed the demolition of Claremont Post Office. A public backlash ensued. A defence of Claremont Post Office was spearheaded by the Town Council, the Claremont Historical Society and a sympathetic local newspaper, the Claremont Nedlands Post. The debate lasted until early April 1983 when Australia Post said that it would retain the building and upgrade it to service modern postal requirements. The upgrading was finished in January 1985 at a cost of $265,000 and Claremont Post Office reopened on 29 January 1985.", "Sited opposite the Railway Station and Stationmasters House (1886) and the Hotel (1888), Claremont Post Office defines the end of Bay View Terrace and creates a gateway to the main shopping precinct of Claremont. Claremont Post Office is a single storey building, in the Federation Romanesque style and features a large semi-circular window which addresses the western facade and a curved porch which addresses the corner. It was originally constructed in a domestic version of the Federation Romanesque style exhibiting a simple massing, shingled roof, square routed verandah posts, irregular roof form, projecting gable and rusticated stone work. The form was asymmetrical with an entrance porch on the Northern side of a large semi-circular window and a return verandah leading away from the southern side. Above the porch was a sign at roof level with the words 'Post Office'. In 1914, alterations to the building, under the direction of Hillson Beasley, removed the north-west porch and replaced it with a curved porch, which addressed the corner of Gugeri Street and Bay View Terrace and echoed the lines of the semi-circular window, thus increasing the sculptural quality of the facade. Above the semi-circular window a small pediment was added with the words 'Post Office' incorporated and a small porch, in rusticated stonework, added to the southern side. The roof line was also altered at this time by increasing the roof height and forming a prominent ridge line, incorporating ventilation and creating a gambrel effect. The original shingles were replaced by Marseilles tiles with decorative finials and ridge decorations emphasising the new lines. Claremont Post Office incorporated the Postmaster's residential quarters with the Post and Telegraphic Office. The quarters were accessible both from the main rooms of the post office and the rear of the building, via separate entrance on the eastern elevation. This entrance way has a rusticated entrance arch, creating a shallow porch and is flanked by windows on either side. Both these windows are rusticated on the eastern facade, which creates, in combination with the recessed doorway, a pleasantly sculptural quality to that which is effectively a rear entrance. In the 1950s the open verandah on the northern elevation facing Gugeri Street, was modified with brick wall, timber windows and a tiled skillion roof. This area is now used as a store and for bikes. According to photographs, the stonework was painted, prior to 1972, but the strong form of the limestone facades and the terracotta tiled roof have survived."]}, {"page": "Northam Post Office", "response": ["In February 1905, the federal Postmaster-General's Department made a recommendation that the Northam Post Office be moved to a more convenient location and by July a site had been purchased for \u00a3450 from J. Sermon. Initially, State Government architect Hillson Beasley prepared sketch plans, but works were held up pending alterations requested by the Commonwealth Public Works. By 1908, the State Public Works Department (PWD), Commonwealth Works Officers and Post Department had not agreed on the sketch plans, leading the Post-Master General's Department (PMG) to submit new plans to the PWD. The two architects most heavily involved in post office work at that time were John Smith Murdoch and Horace Mackennal, who are believed, through the PMG, to have prepared a new set of plans and sent them back to the State Architect for full documentation, although this has not been confirmed.", "Northam Post Office, erected in 1908 to a design by Hillson Beasley, chief architect of the Western Australian Public Works Department, is important in illustrating the expansion of postal services in Western Australia's rural sector under the combined administration of the Commonwealth Post Department and the Western Australian Public Works Department. The original planning and operation of the building as a combined post office and residence is also relatively intact. This is rare in the national context", "Typologically, Northam Post Office is an example of a post office and residence which are conceived as separate components and skilfully unified into a composite form. Northam Post Office is a good example of the use of the Federation Free Style for public buildings of this period, and is characteristic of the striated style common to Hillson Beasley (Criterion d). The design of the public hall is skilfully manipulated by the introduction of clerestory windows which impart a grand civic scale in an architecturally distinguished building which is a landmark feature in the town and its streetscapes . The striking building successfully employs contrasting red brick and rendered detailing, including a striation of alternating bands ('blood and bandages'). The pedimented roof over the corner hall holds the \"anchoring\" flanking wings apart, working formally like a Federation corner tower to assert a diagonal line of force against the right-angled intersection. The thickly columned corner verandah, linked to its roof with a thick boarded frieze turning down at the corners over each column, also approximates the heavy round free Romanesque arch in the framework of a trabeated verandah."]}, {"page": "Victoria Park Post Office", "response": ["A site for a new post office was purchased by the Commonwealth in July 1913 on the eastern corner of the highway and Duncan Street.WAHC, p.4 The intention was to redevelop a house then on the site to provide larger premises.

An earlier post and telegraph office of 1898, in leased premises, was later replaced by the current building on its prominent and centrally located corner site. The generous size of the building, its rich original detailing and presentation to two streetscapes (albeit diminished by later works), and its location in an important part of the Victoria Park commercial area, all enhance these aspects of significance, as does its role as a recognisable historic public building within the townscape (criteria a and g)."]}, {"page": "List of State Register of Heritage Places in the Town of Victoria Park", "response": ["*Built in the Federation Free style under chief architect Hillson Beasley", "*Built in the Federation Free style under chief architect Hillson Beasley"]}]}}
