I had a great craic doing it, Rita's very bubbly and energetic and I'm waiting to see if she'll become a recurring character.\" She added: \"I'd always watched Emmerdale so this was pretty big for me, sitting in The Woolpack with the cast and crew, but they're an awful humble and lovely bunch of people, very kind and welcoming and it was really nice to be able to work on it.\""]}, {"page": "Shane Warne", "response": ["On 7 May 2006, the News of the World tabloid newspaper published pictures of Warne standing in his underwear with models Coralie Eichholz and Emma Kearney as well as leaking explicit text messages allegedly from Warne, although he was divorced by this point."]}, {"page": "Coronation Street Live (2010 episode)", "response": ["* Emma Kearney as Joanne"]}, {"page": "Mr. Bhatti on Chutti", "response": ["* Emma Kearney as Alice"]}, {"page": "Emma Kearney", "response": ["Emma Kearney may refer to:", "* Emma Kearney (actress) (born 1981), Irish actress", "* Emma Kearney (sportswoman) (born 1989), Australian cricketer and footballer"]}, {"page": "Kearney (surname)", "response": ["* Emma Kearney (actress) (born 1981), Irish television and theatre actress", "* Emma Kearney (sportswoman) (born 1989), Australian cricket and football player"]}]}}
