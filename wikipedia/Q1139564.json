He would then go on to be Charlton's first choice goalkeeper for a number of seasons, until he joined Newcastle United on transfer deadline day in the summer of 2011. Signed mainly as a back-up to Tim Krul, he featured for the club sporadically, but became first choice in the 2015\u201316 season after Krul suffered a season-ending injury.\nThrough the origins of his father's family, Elliot became eligible to represent the Republic of Ireland national football team, and was first called up in 2013, making his debut the following year. Elliot retired from the first team in 2017.In June 2020 Elliot was released by Newcastle United after nine years. In January 2021, Elliot signed for Watford until the end of the 2020\u201321 season.
