On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82\u00b0S and discovered the Antarctic Plateau, on which the South Pole is located. On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, less than five weeks after Amundsen's South Pole expedition.\nA planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, despite Scott's written instructions, and at a distance of 162 miles (261 km) from their base camp at Hut Point and approximately 12.5 miles (20 km) from the next depot, Scott and his companions died. When Scott and his party's bodies were discovered, they had in their possession the first Antarctic fossils ever discovered. The fossils were determined to be from the Glossopteris tree and proved that Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents.Before his appointment to lead the Discovery expedition, Scott had a career as a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, he had a chance encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead. Having taken this step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.\nFollowing the news of his death, Scott became a celebrated hero, a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK. However, in the last decades of the 20th century, questions were raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221240 \u00b0F) in March 1912, and after re-discovering Scott's written orders of October 1911, in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Devon", "response": ["Devon is known for its mariners, such as Sir Francis Drake, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Sir Richard Grenville, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Francis Chichester.

This led to the nickname limey for British sailors. Lind's discovery, however, was not widely accepted by individuals in the Royal Navy's Arctic expeditions in the 19th century, where it was widely believed that scurvy could be prevented by practicing good hygiene, regular exercise, and maintaining the morale of the crew while on board, rather than by a diet of fresh food. As a result, Arctic expeditions continued to be plagued by scurvy and other deficiency diseases. In the early 20th century, when Robert Falcon Scott made his two expeditions to the Antarctic, the prevailing medical theory at the time was that scurvy was caused by \"tainted\" canned food."]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["*July 25 - Kathleen Scott, British sculptor and wife of explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott (b. 1878)"]}, {"page": "1912", "response": ["* January 17 \u2013 British polar explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott and a team of four become the second expeditionary group to reach the South Pole.", "* March 29 \u2013 The remaining members of Robert Falcon Scott's South Pole expedition die.", "** Robert Falcon Scott, British naval officer and explorer (b. 1868)"]}, {"page": "1901", "response": ["* August 6 \u2013 Discovery Expedition: Robert Falcon Scott sets sail on the RRS Discovery, to explore the Ross Sea in Antarctica."]}, {"page": "1910", "response": ["* June 15 \u2013 The British Antarctic Expedition, led by Robert Falcon Scott on the whaler Terra Nova, departs from Cardiff for the South Pole."]}, {"page": "1868", "response": ["* June 6 \u2013 Robert Falcon Scott, English Antarctic explorer (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "1985", "response": ["* November 3 - The Footsteps of Scott expedition, lead by Robert Swan set off from Ross Island, retracing Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated route to the South Pole."]}, {"page": "History of Antarctica", "response": ["Several expeditions attempted to reach the South Pole in the early 20th century, during the \"Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration\".
