He also spent a period on loan at Bradford City where he failed to score in five games at the start of the 1983\u201384 season. He left Oakwell in August 1984, after 38 league games in which he scored five goals, joining Darlington. He was top scorer the following season as Darlington, under Cyril Knowles, won promotion to the Third Division. He went on to score 28 goals in 75 league games before his transfer to Belgian side Charleroi in May 1986. His stay in Belgium was a short one, making 3 appearances without scoring, before returning to England in December of the same year to join Chesterfield on loan for whom he played 26 league games, scoring four goals. In August 1987, Airey was on the move once more, this time to Rotherham United, where he averaged a goal every three games, scoring 11 in 32 league games. He teamed up again with Knowles and former teammate Phil Lloyd when he joined Torquay United in December 1988. He made his debut on 20 January 1989 when he came on as a substitute for Ian Weston in a 2\u20130 defeat away to Halifax Town. He struggled to establish himself in the starting line-up, although he did start at Wembley in the 1989 Associate Members' Cup Final against Bolton Wanderers."]}, {"page": "1989 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["| || ||Phil Lloyd"]}, {"page": "List of Torquay United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|LloydPhil Lloyd"]}, {"page": "Phil Lloyd", "response": ["Phil Lloyd is the name of:", "*Phil Lloyd (actor), Australian actor", "*Phil Lloyd (footballer), English footballer"]}]}}
