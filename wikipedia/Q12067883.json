It is the largest of no fewer than eighteen works Monet painted of his home commune of Argenteuil  while it was under a blanket of snow during the winter of 1874\u20131875. This painting\u2014number\u00a0352 in Wildenstein's catalogue of the works of Monet\u2014is the largest of the eighteen. The attention to detail evident in the smaller paintings is less evident in this larger picture. Instead, Monet has rendered large areas of the canvas in closely like tones and colours of blue and grey. The application of smaller strokes of greens, yellows, reds and darker blues breaks up these large expanses, and the almost choreographed dispersal of these various colours helps bind the picture together. Paint at the depicted road surface is thicker than elsewhere in the painting, and impasto is suggestive of the feel of disturbed snow.The Simon Sainsbury Bequest to Tate and The National Gallery.
