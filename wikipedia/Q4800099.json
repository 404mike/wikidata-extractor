A short man of less than athletic physique, he began playing for Leadmill St Mary's and, very briefly, as an 18-year-old, for Doncaster Rovers in March 1912. He had been on the teamsheet for Doncaster reserves as \"S.O. Else\" and managed a hat-trick in what was his first game. The following Saturday he played for the first team in the Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup final, because one of the Rovers forwards was injured and another ineligible. He scored two goals in a 3\u22121 victory and was carried off the field by the Rovers supporters. However, because he had not been  officially transferred from Leadmill, Doncaster were fined 10 shillings.Within a couple of weeks, he had joined Birmingham of the Football League Second Division. He made his debut on 6 April 1912, scoring twice in a 4\u20130 win at home to Burnley. Over the next three seasons Reed played only intermittently, apart from a run of nine consecutive games at the end of the 1912\u201313 season in which he scored six goals, and he retired through injury in 1917.", "link_mentions": {}}}
