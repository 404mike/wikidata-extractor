He soon established a reputation for \"strong, decisive tackling and excellent distribution\" and became a permanent fixture at the left of the defence, rarely missing a match over the next two seasons. In 1907, he scored twice in the opening five matches and his form in defence brought him to the attention of Football League clubs, who made \"tempting offers\" in an attempt to persuade the \"Saints\" to sell him. In the Cup, he helped Southampton reach the FA Cup Semi Finals in March 1908, where they went out to Wolverhampton Wanderers, having beaten First Division Everton en route."]}, {"page": "Jack Warner (footballer, born 1883)", "response": ["In May 1905, he moved to the south coast to join Southampton of the Southern League.
