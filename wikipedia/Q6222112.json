John succeeded his father as editor of the business in 1834, on William's death. Four years later he was joined by Major William Blackwood, who continued in the firm until his death in 1861. Five of William Blackwood's seven sons played a role in the running of the company, William Blackwood and Sons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Hanning Speke", "response": ["Speke and Grant now returned to England, where they arrived in June 1863 and were welcomed as genuine heroes. This did not last long in Speke's case however; disputes with Burton, who was relentless in his criticisms and a very compelling public speaker and gifted writer, left Speke's discoveries in less than an ideal light.  Speke had also committed to write a book for John Blackwood which he found hard and time-consuming as he was not naturally a gifted writer. He failed to give a good and full report to the RGS for many months and thus in effect was not defending his positions of discovery.  In addition Speke had a public dispute with the Pethericks who had by and large acted according to their RGS instructions but Speke had felt they had not. All this led Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, to start disliking Speke and a third expedition, led by Speke, was becoming less likely as it would have to be funded by the people Speke was now not on good terms with. It appears that just as Burton had overplayed his hand after the first trip Speke now did the same. Now the RGS asked that a public debate should be held between Speke and Burton to try and settle the Nile."]}, {"page": "Dean Cemetery", "response": ["* John Blackwood (1818\u20131879) creator and editor of Blackwood's Magazine"]}, {"page": "Middlemarch", "response": ["By May 1871, the growing length of the novel had become a concern to Eliot, as it threatened to exceed the three-volume format that was the norm in publishing. The issue was compounded because Eliot's most recent novel, Felix Holt, the Radical (1866) \u2013 also set in the same pre-Reform Bill England \u2013 had not sold well. The publisher John Blackwood, who had made a loss on acquiring the English rights to that novel, was approached by Lewes in his role as Eliot's literary agent. He suggested that the novel be brought out in eight two-monthly parts, borrowing the method used for Victor Hugo's novel Les Mis\u00e9rables. This was an alternative to the monthly issues that had been used for such longer works as Charles Dickens's David Copperfield and William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair, and avoided Eliot's objections to the slicing of her novel into small parts. Blackwood agreed, although he feared there would be \"complaints of a want of the continuous interest in the story\" due to the independence of each volume. The eight books duly appeared during 1872, the last three instalments being issued monthly."]}, {"page": "1860 in literature", "response": ["*April 4 \u2013 George Eliot's novel The Mill on the Floss is published by John Blackwood in three volumes."]}, {"page": "1859 in literature", "response": ["*February 1 \u2013 George Eliot's Adam Bede, her first full-length novel, is published by John Blackwood in the United Kingdom.

Both George Henry Lewes and John Blackwood were reportedly excited at the prospect of a novel pertinent to current affairs. However, upon the story's release, some criticism was drawn to its less-than-substantial focus on politics, although this itself can be argued as representing an underlying theme in the book.
