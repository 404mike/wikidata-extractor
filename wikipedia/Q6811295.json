Significantly, the government did not invite trade associations such as RMI, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, and the Scottish Motor Trade Association to the DTI Good Garage scheme announcement meeting; each association previously had refused to submit garages within their organisations to a system of independent inspection. About a week after DTI's Good Garage scheme announcement, trade associations announced that they would develop their own Good Garage scheme to be maintained by a self-regulatory body. In May 2003, motor industry representatives and representatives from the Office of Fair Trading signed an agreement to create an industry run Good Garage Scheme (industry) that would set standards for local garages.", "On 23 September 2002, seven days after DTI Consumer Minister Melanie Johnson released the government Good Garage scheme, Forte Lubricants registered goodgaragescheme.com as a domain name. In 2003, just after motor industry representatives and representatives from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) signed an agreement to create an industry run Good Garage Scheme, the Office of Fair Trading issued a car service checklist that recommended to garages what should be included in a service and enabled consumers to compare what different garages offer as part of a car service. Forte Lubricants then began using the Office of Fair Trading's car service checklist in its promotional material. The Office of Fair Trading felt that Forte Lubricants' usage of the checklist as well as usage of the OFT's name and logo in its marketing material lead to consumers to believe that the OFT recommended the use of a fuel system cleaner and an engine oil flush, neither of which were addressed by the Office of Fair Trading. In general, the OFT does not approve any products or recommend what products should be used by garages when providing a car service. In response to a request by the Office of Fair Trading, Forte Lubricants agreed in June 2003 to stop using the OFT's name and logo in Forte's marketing material as legal action was threatened against Forte."]}, {"page": "First Blair ministry", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" |Melanie Johnson"]}, {"page": "Second Blair ministry", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" |Melanie Johnson", "! scope=\"row\" |Melanie Johnson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs who lost their seat in the 1997 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Melanie Johnson"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Vaccines and Public Health", "response": ["|Melanie Johnson"]}]}}
