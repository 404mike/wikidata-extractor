He recommended her to his colleague Tom Walls, who was in search of a leading lady to succeed Yvonne Arnaud in his series of farces at the Aldwych Theatre, London. From 1926 to 1932, Shotter played in eight of the farces, in a regular company headed by Walls and Ralph Lynn. She appeared in several films during the 1930s, including adaptations of four of the Aldwych plays.\nAfter the Aldwych series ended, Shotter appeared in numerous West End shows, worked briefly in Hollywood, and continued to appear in British films. During the Second World War she joined the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), performing for troops in Europe and Asia.  An example is French Leave, a play by Reginald Berkeley, sub-titled: A Normandy Story, where she appeared with Lawrence O'Madden. After the war she joined the BBC as an announcer on the relaunched television service. During the 1950s she gradually withdrew from performing and retired to Switzerland with her second husband.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ben Travers", "response": ["With Travers's agreement, Grossmith sold the rights to A Cuckoo in the Nest to Walls, and the play opened at the Aldwych in July 1925.\"Aldwych Theatre\", The Times, 23 July 1925, p. 12 The leading lady was Yvonne Arnaud, and the two leading men were Walls and Ralph Lynn.

The attitude to life of Mr. Blake, the music master, Is expounded in a single phrase. \"I wonder why that didn't hit me,\" he ponders when a loose slate slides from a rooftop and shatters at his feet. Poor Mr. Blake has had 35 years of bad luck...Mr. Lynn contrives to leaven his foolery with touches of genuine pathos, but when his luck changes to prove the comforting theory that a man has as much good as bad fortune in his life, he fairly romps in his Rookery Nook style, through broader and yet broader farce.
