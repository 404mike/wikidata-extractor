He joined United on a permanent deal a year later and went on to spend three years at Brunton Park before joining Grimsby Town in 1996. It was at Grimsby where he arguably played some of his best football, during the 1997\u201398 season the club earned promotion via the play-offs as well as a few weeks earlier being victorious in the Football League Trophy. He departed Grimsby in 2003 after spending seven seasons at Blundell Park, his next port of call was league rivals Barnsley where he remained for a year before joining Rochdale. Having spent two seasons with Dale, Gallimore dropped out of professional football and signed with non-league Northwich Victoria in 2006. He finished his seventeen-year career whilst on loan with Hucknall Town in 2007. During his career he made more than 500 appearances in the Football League.\nAfter retiring Gallimore returned to live in Grimsby where he works as a scaffolder.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darren Barnard", "response": ["Barnard joined Grimsby Town for the start of the 2002\u201303 season along with fellow Barnsley player Steve Chettle. Barnard was used as a left-sided midfielder in his first season while under manager Paul Groves but was also used at left-back, the latter was primarily his main position after the departure of Tony Gallimore in the summer of 2003. In both Barnard's seasons at Blundell Park he suffered relegations in which Grimsby went from Division One to Division Three. Following the club's financial difficulties many of Barnard's colleagues had been inexperienced youngsters. Despite not having any luck at his club, Barnard collected another 6 Welsh caps, the last as a substitute against Norway on 27 May 2004, coincidentally alongside former Grimsby teammates Danny Coyne and John Oster."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Tony Gallimore||||LB||1995\u20132002||273||4"]}, {"page": "Mark Lever", "response": ["Lever came through the youth ranks at Grimsby Town and was promoted to the club's first team squad by Alan Buckley at the beginning of the 1987\u20131988 season. He naturally soon became one of the club's regular centre backs, and found himself slotting in at the side of veteran centre half Paul Futcher. Lever received the club's \"Supporters Young Player of The Season\" awards in both 1989 and 1991. He went on to be an integral part of the Town side that earned two back to back promotions in 1990 and 1991. When Futcher moved on, Grimsby nurtured in Peter Handyside as his long-term replacement, and both players were part of an iconic Mariners defensive line up in the nineties that included the likes of Gary Croft, Graham Rodger, John McDermott and Tony Gallimore."]}, {"page": "David Smith (footballer, born 1968)", "response": ["On 2 March 2002, he scored the 5th goal in the 88th minute for the 'Mariners' in the 5\u20132 victory against promotion-chasing Crystal Palace, after some well worked movement by Danny Butterfield he passed to Smith who slotted the ball home. He continued as a regular first-team player until he picked up an injury in a 2001\u201302 game against Gillingham. Smith was a key member of that squad, proving his versatility by performing as a deputy for Tony Gallimore and regularly playing there for tactical reasons."]}, {"page": "Peter Handyside", "response": ["Handyside was trialed by Grimsby Town and was signed by the club's youth team in 1990. He took his step up into the first team in 1992 and was eventually the club's long term replacement for veteran centre back Paul Futcher and made an excellent pairing with Mark Lever. Handyside's maturity grew and he became an integral part of Grimsby's defensive setup, and along with Lever, John McDermott, Tony Gallimore, Graham Rodger, Kevin Jobling and Richard Smith was part of arguably Grimsby's best ever defence. The 1997\u20131998 Handyside continued to be the nucleus of Town's strong defence that helped achieve a promotion to back to the First Division via the play-offs, and victory in the Football League Trophy. He bowed out at Grimsby after the 2000\u201301 season. An injury troubled campaign, he was often replaced by loan signing Zhang Enhua. At the end of the season, he rejected the chance to stay on with Grimsby and moved to Second Division Stoke City.", "Hucknall Town signed Handyside for the 2006\u201307 campaign. He remained at the club for one year before leaving the club on a free transfer. Handyside has played alongside his fellow Grimsby promotion winning teammate Tony Gallimore at four different clubs: Grimsby, Barnsley, Northwich Victoria and Hucknall; the only team at which Peter has not played with Tony is Stoke City, ironically Gallimore's first senior club."]}, {"page": "Ben Chapman (footballer, born 1979)", "response": ["Chapman came through the youth ranks with professional club Grimsby Town and signed professionally with The Mariners in 1997. He made his first team debut for the club in a 1\u20130 victory over local rivals Hull City in the Football League Trophy in January 1998. He would have to wait another 18 months before he was called up for action again, and made a run out against Watford . Ben was used as the club's reserve left back and was understudy to Tony Gallimore, Chapman only managed 2 appearances in both the 1999-2000 and 2000\u20132001 season and would have to wait until the 2001-2002 campaign before he started to have a regular run in first team affairs. Notably that season Chapman played for Grimsby on both Anfield and Highbury as Grimsby recorded a historic cup win over Liverpool before being knocked out by Arsenal. In the Liverpool game, a Grimsby corner resulted in Chapman volleying just close over the crossbar and was Grimsby's only clear cut chance in the first half of play. He would go on to never get on the score sheet for the club. While playing for Grimsby, Chapman was responsible for ending the career of Scunthorpe United midfielder Peter Morrison during a pre season friendly in 2001. The game was abandoned as a result of the injury, and eventually following court proceedings, Morrison was rewarded a \u00a3400,000 compensation pay out."]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|03 ||  Tony Gallimore || Barnsley || 30 || Released"]}, {"page": "List of footballers in England by number of league appearances", "response": ["!scope=row data-sort-value=\"Gallimore, Tony\"|Tony Gallimore"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Football League Trophy", "response": ["|DF ||3 ||Tony Gallimore || || "]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Tony Gallimore"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Tony Gallimore"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Tony Gallimore"]}, {"page": "1998 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|LB ||3||Tony Gallimore || "]}, {"page": "1995 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|DF || ||Tony Gallimore "]}, {"page": "History of Carlisle United F.C.", "response": ["The following season was a tough one for Carlisle.
