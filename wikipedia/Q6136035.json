This time he made a rather better fist of things, scoring 44 in his only innings and taking the only wicket of his career when he bowled Warwickshire's number ten Ernest Suckling.\nHe taught History at Oundle School after the War, where he later became a housemaster.  In 1925 Higgs-Walker was appointed headmaster of Sevenoaks School, a post in which he remained until 1954.\nHiggs-Walker was born at Wychbury House, Clent, Worcestershire; he died aged 87 in Midhurst, Sussex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sevenoaks School", "response": ["James Higgs-Walker succeeded Garrod in 1924.
