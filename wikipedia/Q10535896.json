He made his first-team debut in April 2012, though did not play for the first team again. After loan spells at Port Vale in October 2014 and Raith Rovers in the second half of the 2015\u201316 season, he was released by Leicester. He joined Barrow in September 2016, and was loaned out to Salford City in March 2017. He signed with Nuneaton Borough in June 2018, before moving on to Greek side Aittitos Spata in January 2019 and then returned to the English National League with Aldershot Town in July 2019. After two seasons there, Panayiotou joined Scottish Premiership side Livingston for a short spell, but returned to Aldershot Town in January 2022.\nPanayiotou represents Saint Kitts and Nevis at international level, having made his international debut in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Livingston F.C.", "response": ["*   Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "Saint Kitts and Nevis national football team", "response": ["|style=\"text-align: left;\"|Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "Bushloe High School", "response": ["*Harry Panayiotou, football player"]}, {"page": "List of foreign EFL Championship players", "response": ["*Harry Panayiotou \u2013 Leicester City 2011\u201312"]}, {"page": "HKFC Soccer Sevens", "response": ["|Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["| Harry Panayiotou", "| Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["*21 September 2012 \u2013 Academy players, Harry Panayiotou and Joe Dodoo, sign their first professional contracts.", "| Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Scottish Premiership players", "response": ["*Harry Panayiotou - Livingston - 2021"]}, {"page": "Wigston College", "response": ["*Harry Panayiotou, footballer who currently plays for Aittitos Spata"]}, {"page": "2014 Caribbean Cup qualification", "response": ["* Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["| Harry Panayiotou", "|Under-21 Player of the year Award ||  Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["A trip to Fleetwood Town on 4 October proved fruitless after a late penalty gave Fleetwood a 1\u20130 win; Vale had played well and seemed to have done enough to earn a point despite playing much of the match with ten men after Slew was sent off for striking an opposition player. In search of a first clean sheet of the season, Page signed 19-year-old centre-back Remie Streete on loan from Newcastle United. Vale came out of the relegation zone on 11 October with a convincing 4\u20131 win over struggling Yeovil Town. A 2\u20130 defeat followed at Deepdale, with Zubar receiving a straight red card for lashing out at Preston North End's Joe Garner. After the game Page condemned Garner for play-acting throughout the match to try and get Vale player's sent off. The loan signings continued, as Leicester City's Saint Kitts and Nevis international striker Harry Panayiotou arrived on a one-month loan. The club were also in talks with former Premier League midfielder Isaiah Osbourne, who instead joined fellow relegation battlers Scunthorpe United. Ironically a few days later Scunthorpe then came to Burslem, as did the remnants of Hurricane Gonzalo, and the game ended 2\u20132 despite the Vale leading 2\u20131 and facing ten men after former player Jennison Myrie-Williams was sent off. The fifth signing of Page's reign then arrived in the form of French striker Dany N'Guessan, who signed a two-month deal. The signing came in good time as Tom Pope was later ruled out of action for a few weeks with a knee injury. Vale then beat Leyton Orient 3\u20130, keeping their first clean sheet of the season; Orient were reduced to ten men early in the first half after Darius Henderson was sent-off for elbowing Richard Duffy. Having taken the club up seven league places within six weeks, Page was appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 29 October.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||27||align=\"left\"| Harry Panayiotou", "|20 October 2014||FW||||Harry Panayiotou||Leicester City||16 November 2014||"]}, {"page": "Premier League International Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Premier League International Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2015 CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship qualification", "response": ["* Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Raith Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["||| FW|| Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["| Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "Panayiotou", "response": ["* Harry Panayiotou (born 1994), Saint Kitts and Nevis footballer"]}, {"page": "2017 Caribbean Cup qualification", "response": ["* Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["| Harry Panayiotou"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Livingston F.C. season", "response": ["| Harry Panayiotou", "| Harry Panayiotou"]}]}}
