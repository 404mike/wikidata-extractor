Jones chaired a number of \"extraordinary business meetings\" with the aim of defusing the conflict, and these continued into the war years.  The meetings, which became known as the controversial discussions, were established on a more regular basis from 1942. By that time, Jones had removed himself from direct participation, owing to ill health and the difficulties of war-time travel from his home in Elsted, West Sussex.  He resigned from the presidency of the British Society in 1944, the year in which, under the presidency of Sylvia Payne, there finally emerged a compromise agreement which established parallel training courses providing options to satisfy the concerns of the rival groups that had formed: followers of Anna Freud, followers of Melanie Klein and a non-aligned group of Middle or Independent Group analysts. It was agreed further that all the key policy making committees of the BPS should have representatives from the three groups.Baker, Ron \u2018The evolution of organisational and training procedures in psychoanalytic associations: a brief account of the unique British contribution\u2019 in Johns, J. and Steiner, R.
