Aldershot Town was born later the same year, and began life competing in the Isthmian League Division Three. Despite Aldershot Town playing five divisions lower than the Football League, the attendance for their first competitive fixture was higher than the old team's last home tie. Ten successive victories were recorded under the guidance of former player Steve Wignall and Aldershot won the championship by an 18-point margin.", "A further promotion and an FA Vase quarter-final placing was achieved in the 1993\u201394 season. When Steve Wignall departed to take charge of Colchester United midway through the 1994\u201395 season, former Nottingham Forest winger Steve Wigley took over. The club finished the 1994\u201395 season with a run of six successive victories, but missed out on promotion by goal difference. After narrowly missing out during the next two seasons Wigley left in July 1997 to become Youth Development Officer at Nottingham Forest. He was replaced by George Borg. Attendances continued to rise during this period and the final fixture of the 1997\u201398 Isthmian League First Division championship-winning season, at home to Berkhamsted Town, attracted 4,289 people to the Recreation Ground\u00a0\u2013 a league record.

Initially, he struggled to adapt and he preferred going to nightclubs over playing for Colchester, Harrop says, \"It took a lot of hard work by the staff at Colchester. Micky Cook, the director of youth, had to spend endless hours with him and [manager] Steve Wignall and then [the next manager] Steve Whitton had to spend a lot of time with him talking him through the tactical side of the game and what his role was within the team\". LuaLua scored within four minutes of his debut where he appeared as a substitute in a 3\u20131 defeat to Chesterfield. In two seasons, he made 68 league and cup appearances for Colchester, 44\u00a0starts and 24 substitute appearances, scoring a total of 21\u00a0goals. His performances attracted the attention of several Premiership clubs and despite manager Steve Whitton's denial that LuaLua was for sale, LuaLua joined Newcastle United in September 2000 for a fee of \u00a32.25\u00a0million. An earlier offer by Newcastle of \u00a3300,000 for LuaLua made by former manager, Ruud Gullit, had been rejected, but the much increased bid offered financial security and assistance towards a new ground and was one that Colchester felt they could not turn down.", "LuaLua wrote the foreword in \"You Can Have Chips\", the autobiography of his former manager Steve Wignall."]}]}}
