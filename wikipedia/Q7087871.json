In July that year, the band toured Europe. They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before, such as Serbia and Macedonia. Roxy Music's second drummer, Andy Newmark, performed during the tour, as Thompson withdrew due to health issues, and Oliver Thompson (guitar) made his first appearance with the band."]}, {"page": "Oliver thompson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Oliver Thompson "]}, {"page": "Dylanesque", "response": ["* Oliver Thompson \u2013 guitars "]}]}}
