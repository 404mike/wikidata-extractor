In response to accusations of lack of action by the government, a member of the government's LGBT+ advisory panel, Jayne Ozanne, resigned. In April 2021, after another two members of the panel quit over lack of action on banning conversion therapy, Liz Truss, the equalities minister, disbanded the panel.

A letter said to be signed by more than a hundred legal professionals objected to Cunningham's inclusion on the panel, describing her as \"anti-trans\". Kelley called for a complete ban on conversion therapy. Cunningham presented a \"gender critical\" view that there are multiple explanations for why a young person may call themselves transgender, such as unease at being gay, so a ban on therapists exploring these alternative explanations amounts to \"the most savage conversion therapy ever invented\".
