At the age of 15 he entered the Royal College of Music and later attended the Royal Academy of Music (RAM) on an exhibition scholarship. After graduating from the RAM in 1990, Capet served as music director of multiple ensembles over the next several years, including the Pegasus Ensemble, Battersea Arts Centre Opera, The Middlesex Philharmonic, and the Harrow Symphony Orchestra. In 1995 he was appointed the Music Coordinator and Assistant Conductor for the Vancouver Opera.

With the choir he notably organized a re-imagined version of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's The Spectre's Bride which used a new modernized English libretto by Mollie Kaye, shadow puppets by Emmy Award winning puppeteer Tim Gosley, and set designs by Pixar's Michel Gagne.Capet has worked as a freelance conductor for over 20 years, guest conducting orchestras in North America and Europe. In 2009 he made his Carnegie Hall debut conducting concerts with The New York Pops.\nIn 2012 Capet created Classical Social, a weekly jam session for classical musicians to get together, play, socialize and have a beer at Fionn MacCool's, a local pub in downtown Toronto. Highly successful, the Sunday night socials are drawing musicians from all over who revel in the joy of just playing for the fun of it, and audiences who get a live, lively and well played concert for free.\nCapet is a cofounder of the orchestral ensemble euphonia, a group of dynamic musicians who share the objective of creating new audiences for live performances of classical music. In April 2013 euphonia became the new house band at Lula Lounge, a famous nightclub in Toronto and performs there on the second Monday of every month.
