He was a fellow of St John's College (1919\u20131985), Cambridge, and held the positions of University Lecturer in Agriculture (1926\u20131930) and Drapers Professor of Agriculture (1930\u20131957) at Cambridge, where he directed the School of Agriculture from 1930 to 1957. Engledow advised the British government on agricultural production in the (former) colonies as well as in the homeland from 1927 to 1962. He continued to publish on agricultural practices and teaching after his retirement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Udny Yule", "response": ["Yule's first paper on statistics appeared in 1895: \"On the Correlation of Total Pauperism with Proportion of Out-relief\". Yule was interested in applying statistical techniques to social problems and he quickly became a member of the Royal Statistical Society. For many years the only members interested in mathematical statistics were Yule, Edgeworth and Bowley. In 1897\u201399 Yule wrote important papers on correlation and regression); after 1900 he worked on a parallel theory of association. His approach to association was quite different from Pearson's and relations between them deteriorated. Yule had broad interests and his collaborators included the agricultural meteorologist R. H. Hooker, the medical statistician Major Greenwood and the agricultural scientist Sir Frank Engledow. Yule's sympathy towards the newly rediscovered Mendelian theory of genetics led to several papers."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Peary Pal", "response": ["Pal was born in Mukandpur, the youngest child of Dr Rala Ram and Inder Devi. The family came from Jalandhar but his father moved to Burma as a medical officer. He was born Brahma Das Pal but changed his name to Benjamin Peary Pal while at St Michael's School in Maymo in 1914. A rose garden at the school may have inspired his early interest in them. He completed his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees at Rangoon University, with a study on Burmese Charophyta for his master's. He then went for his doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge under Rowland Biffen and later Frank Engledow, studying hybrid vigour in wheat. He then worked as a rice research officer in Burma in 1932 and then moved to Pusa in Bihar as a second economic botanist. He became an Imperial Economic Botanist at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute in 1937. In 1936, the institute moved to New Delhi following an earthquake. He moved there and became the director of the institute in September 1950. He became the first director general of the newly reorganized Indian Council for Agricultural Research in 1965 and worked there until his retirement in 1972. Pal worked on rust resistance in wheats and helped release several varieties."]}, {"page": "Drapers Professor of Agriculture", "response": ["*Sir Frank Engledow 1930-1957."]}, {"page": "Engledow", "response": ["*Frank Engledow (1890\u20131985), British botanist"]}, {"page": "Frank Leonard Engledow", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Engledow"]}, {"page": "Plant Breeding Institute", "response": ["The institute's site was to the west of Cambridge, and it shared land with the School of Agriculture that is today the site of the North West Cambridge development.

Engledow described the facilities as \"two acres of land on Gravel Hill Farm, a cage, a not very large shed and a small greenhouse.\""]}]}}
