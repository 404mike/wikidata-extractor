D. Phiri, a Malawian historian, characterised Chilembwe's uprising as an early expression of Malawian nationalism, as did George Shepperson and Thomas Price in their 1958 book Independent African, an exhaustive study of Chilembwe and his rebellion that was banned during the colonial era but still widely read by the educated classes. Chilembwe became viewed as an \"unproblematic\" hero by many of the country's people. The Malawi Congress Party (MCP), which ultimately led the country to independence in 1964, made a conscious effort to identify its leader Hastings Banda with Chilembwe through speeches and radio broadcasts. Bakili Muluzi, who succeeded Banda in 1994, similarly invoked Chilembwe's memory to win popular support, inaugurating a new annual national holiday, Chilembwe Day, on 16 January 1995. Chilembwe's portrait was soon added to the national currency, the kwacha, and reproduced on Malawian stamps. It has been argued that for Malawian politicians, Chilembwe has become \"symbol, legitimising myth, instrument and propaganda\"."]}, {"page": "African Association", "response": ["In contrast, according to Brent, \"the explorers themselves had no such view of Africans, no simple picture that rejected African reality and denied to Africans their full humanity.\" Mungo Park's description in particular contributed to a balanced perspective.

Review of \"Strike a Blow and Die: A Narrative of Race Relations in Colonial Africa\" by Gideon Simeon Mwase, Journal of African History, Vol. 11, No. 1, pp. 159\u2013160 This was probably the most favourable response, but the reviews of Atmore and Price already mentioned were broadly favourable, although both questioned how accurate was the recollection of Mwase's informant after 17 years and how much was added by Mwase. McCracken also doubts Mwase's accuracy about Chilembwe but valued the light his work threw on the ideas and attitudes of an educated African in the 1930s."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*George Shepperson, 98, British historian.Shepperson"]}, {"page": "George shepperson", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Shepperson"]}, {"page": "Africa and the Victorians", "response": ["A reviewer in The American Historical Review felt that the argument presented would be \"startling\" to African nationalists and economic determinists but was well supported and persuasive, concluding it was a \"well written, stimulating essay.\" George Shepperson reviewed the book in The English Historical Review, concluding that the book was more realistic than others of its genre, considering it an important would that was \"certain to be influential\" but questioning the heavy reliance on official records, which he felt often omitted details or context, and saying that its theorizing represented the weakest parts. Shepperson concluded that the book was generally excellent. A reviewer in Transition called the book \"very important... but also extremely entertaining [and] delightfully written\"."]}]}}
