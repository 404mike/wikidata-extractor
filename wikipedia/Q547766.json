He was sold to Cardiff City for \u00a3500,000 in June 2006, and won a place on the PFA Team of the Year for his performances in the 2006\u201307 season. He then made a \u00a35 million move to Premier League side Sunderland in July 2007, before returning to Cardiff on a loan deal that was made permanent in July 2009 for \u00a33 million. He again was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the 2009\u201310 campaign, before being sold on to Ipswich Town for \u00a31 million in June 2011. He joined Blackpool on a free transfer in July 2013, before moving to the Indian Super League with Kerala Blasters for the inaugural 2014 season. Chopra signed for Scottish Championship club Alloa Athletic in March 2015, playing for the side for a year before being released in March 2016.
