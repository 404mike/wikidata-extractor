On 19 August, media reports confirmed that the first player to sign for the new-look Giants was Nottinghamshire-born forward David Watts, who had previously played for Worcester Wolves. More signings were later unveiled with Manchester-born players Nathan Schall and Stefan Gill (formerly of Cheshire Jets and Milton Keynes Lions respectively) joining ex-Mersey Tigers star David Aliu and brothers Callum and James Jones (both sons of Giants coach Jeff Jones) in the line-up, whilst Great Britain international Nick George was rumored to be a transfer target. Former Giants star Mike Bernard was also confirmed as a new recruit along with young prospect Devan Bailey, just days before the start of the new campaign. thumb|left|Wright Robinson College arena", "The new-look Giants played their first competitive game against London Lions on 21 September 2012, at their home venue at Wright Robinson College. A sell-out crowd witnessed a tight one-point victory in favour of the Giants, winning 85\u201384, with James Jones posting 29 points for the home team. The following week, a convincing 99\u201387 victory at home to Sheffield Sharks meant Giants had opened the season with a 100% record, however their form soon dipped as the new team recorded only one win in the subsequent 12 games. Former Great Britain Under-23 international Ben Eaves was signed at the end of October in a bid to improve Giants' fledgling squad, whilst a deal to sign long-term target Nick George was eventually agreed in December. The team's form gradually started to improve throughout the winter with victories against Durham Wildcats, local rivals Cheshire Phoenix and Mersey Tigers, as well as back-to-back home wins over title-chasing Surrey Heat in January and February 2013. It was announced on 19 February that Nick George had departed the club after making only six appearances. Giants continued with their resurgent form in a bid for a top-eight finish and a place in the end-of-season Play-offs, taking it down to the penultimate game of the regular season. However an 85\u201387 home defeat to fellow Play-off chasers London Lions \u2013 despite a heroic comeback from the Giants who were down 19 points at the start of the fourth quarter \u2013 saw Lions take eighth-place and the final Play-off spot, consigning Giants to a ninth-place finish in their rookie season."]}, {"page": "FIBA EuroBasket 2009 squads", "response": ["| 9  || Nick George || 1.98 || 6-6 || Forward || 1982 ||  Gravelines Dunkerque"]}, {"page": "Nick George", "response": ["Nick George may refer to:", "* Nick George (basketball) (born 1982), British basketball player", "* Nick George, author of comic book stories and animation scripts; see Working for Peanuts", "* Nick George (fictional character), a character in the American television series Dirty Sexy Money"]}, {"page": "2005 CAA Men's Basketball Tournament", "response": ["| Nick George"]}, {"page": "2004 CAA Men's Basketball Tournament", "response": ["| Nick George"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 British Basketball League season", "response": ["**Nick George (Plymouth Raiders)"]}, {"page": "VCU Rams men's basketball statistical leaders", "response": ["| ||Nick George|| 36|| style=\"font-size:80%;\" | 2004\u201305|| style=\"font-size:80%;\"| William & Mary"]}]}}
