It was also in this game that the Australians first wore the green jersey with a double gold 'V', which they have been wearing ever since. The English side boasted one of the great rugby league back lines consisting of captain Jim Sullivan (fullback), Alf Ellaby and Stan Smith (wings), and Artie Atkinson and Stan Brogden in the centres. The gates of the SCG had to be closed to prevent another 15,000 people from entering. Australia lost the game 8\u20136. The second game was the famous \"Battle of Brisbane\" Test, which Australia won. In the third Test back at the SCG Australia lead 11\u20133 until late in the game. Incredibly, England scored three quick tries to snatch the game (18\u201313) and the series. The attendance of the first test stood as the highest recorded crowd for an international rugby league match until 73,631 fans attended the 1992 World Cup Final between Australia and Great Britain at the famous Wembley Stadium in London, England."]}, {"page": "Holbeck", "response": ["* Stan Brogden (1910\u20131981), athlete."]}, {"page": "Brogden", "response": ["* Stan Brogden (1910\u20131981), British Rugby League footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford Bulls internationals", "response": ["* Stan Brogden won caps for England while at Bradford Northern in 1929 against Other Nationalities, while at Huddersfield in 1932 against Wales (2 matches), in 1933 against Other Nationalities, Australia, while at Leeds in 1935 against France, Wales, in 1936 against Wales (2 matches), France, in 1938 against Wales, while at Hull F.C. in 1938 against Wales, in 1939 against France, in 1941 against Wales, in 1943 against Wales, and won caps for Great Britain while at Huddersfield in 1929-30 against Australia, in 1932 against Australia (3 matches), New Zealand (3 matches), in 1933 against Australia (2 matches), while at Leeds in 1936 against Australia (3 matches), New Zealand (2 matches), in 1937 against Australia (2 matches) "]}, {"page": "List of St Helens R.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"  |Stan Brogden"]}, {"page": "List of Leeds Rhinos international players", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Stan Brogden "]}]}}
