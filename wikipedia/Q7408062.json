He batted right-handed and sometimes played as wicket-keeper.\nRedgate played in a total of 78 first-class matches and took 426 known wickets. His best performance was 8 wickets for the North of England against MCC at Burton-on-Trent in 1840. He took 5 wickets in an innings 31 times and 10 wickets in a match 11 times.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Mynn", "response": ["Mynn suffered an ankle injury before the famous 1836 match. He batted with a runner and was unable to bowl. Leg guards had not yet been invented and as he made his hundred in the second innings his legs were badly bruised by the Northern fast bowler Sam Redgate. Mynn's captain, Lord Frederick Beauclerk sent him back to London laid out on the top of a stagecoach."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket (1816\u20131863)", "response": ["Changes in fashion affected the sport and a reaction to the virility cult espoused by Beauclerk and his ilk brought about the introduction of safer equipment such as padded leg-guards and padded gloves. Wicketkeeping gloves were first mentioned about 1820 and were in general use by 1850. Batting pads had been proposed much earlier, particularly by Robert Robinson, but it was not until the horrific leg injury suffered by Alfred Mynn in 1836 from a ball by Sam Redgate that pads were seen as an essential item of equipment.", "Curiously, whereas Sam Redgate was viewed with trepidation in terms of his pace, he was very much a reactionary in fashion terms. Among professionals in the 1830s, he was said to be the last to discard breeches in favour of trousers. Trousers have existed since ancient times but never became fashionable until the sans-culottes of the French Revolution. In England, they began to replace breeches during the Napoleonic War and were widely in use by 1815. Redgate was not alone in his preference for breeches: the Eton and Harrow teams still wore them in 1830."]}, {"page": "North v South", "response": ["Cricket in the 18th century had been predominantly a southern game, played especially in London and the southeastern counties.
