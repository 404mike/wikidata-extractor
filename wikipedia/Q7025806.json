It was founded by Peter Cook and Nicholas Luard, both of whom were also important in the history of the magazine Private Eye. The name \"The Establishment\" is a play on the meaning of \"establishment\" as in \"institution,\" i.e. the club itself, and the broader definition meaning the prevailing social order of the time, which the satirists who founded, funded and performed at the club typically undermined. A pun is suggested as, to be a member of this club, was to literally but not figuratively be a 'member of the establishment'.

Wells bought No. 17 in 1909 and lived there with his wife, Jane, and two sons, George \"Gip\" Philip and Frank Richard, until 1912. In 1910 Gip underwent an appendectomy in the study of the house. Wells wrote The History of Mr Polly, Tono-Bungay, Ann Veronica, The Sleeper Awakes, The New Machiavelli and Marriage while at the house as well as having an extramarital affair with the writer Elizabeth von Arnim while living there. In August 1909, in the first year of the family's occupation, Wells's daughter with Amber Reeves, a 21-year-old student, and future feminist writer, was born. Wells also lived in a flat in Candover Street, off Great Portland Street at this time. Wells's book Floor Games, written in 1911, was inspired by children's games he and his sons would play on the floors of the house. A frequent visitor to Wells at the house was George Bernard Shaw who recommended that he purchase a pianola, which he duly did. The comedian Peter Cook bought No. 17 for \u00a324,000 in 1965 () and lived here with his wife and two daughters until 1971, when it was sold for \u00a345,000. Cook and Dudley Moore wrote their Pete & Dud routines in the attic of the house, Cook's study. The kitchen was in the basement of the house and Cook's wife, Wendy, would prepare dinner parties that would attract many notable people of the 1960s including John Bird, Eleanor Bron, John Cleese, Michael Foot, Bernard Levin, Victor Lownes, Malcolm Muggeridge, Charlotte Rampling, Willie Rushton, Peter Sellers, Cat Stevens, Ken Tynan and Peter Ustinov. Frequent visitors to Cook at the house included John and Cynthia Lennon and Paul McCartney. Lennon and Cook would perform comedy routines and characters at the dinner table. Nicholas Luard recalled a dinner party with an eclectic mix of guests including the actors Tom Courtney, and Peter O'Toole, the poet Christopher Logue, fashion designer Mary Quant and the boxer Terry Downes."]}]}}
