Josephine's head gardener at Malmaison, Howatson, was English, but Alice M. Coats suggests that it was probably the well-established Scottish gardener and landscape designer, Thomas Blaikie, who put her in touch with Lee and Kennedy; her relation with a London-based firm was one of the curiosities of garden history, according to Coats.Alice M. Coats, \"The Empress Jos\u00e9phine\", Garden History 5.3 (Winter 1977:40-46). By 1803 the Empress had run up an outstanding bill with them of \u00a32600. She helped them support a young plant hunter, James Niven (1776\u20131827), at the Cape of Good Hope, in expectation of sharing boxes of seeds and plants of never-before-seen rarities of the scarcely botanized Cape Province: heaths, ixias, pelargoniums and others.E.

With the revival of war between France and Britain, John Kennedy had a special permit to come and go to the Continent, advising the Empress on the collection she was forming at Malmaison. There were setbacks: in 1804 she complained in a letter that shipments of seeds had been captured and detained; but in 1811 her expenditures with the firm again amounted to \u00a3700.Coats 1977:40, 43. At Malmaison, she installed a plant nursery, to ready her imports for distribution among French growers."]}, {"page": "History of parks and gardens of Paris", "response": ["thumb|left|Map of the garden by Thomas Blaikie", "The Parc de Bagatelle was created by the Count of Artois, the future King Charles X of France, on a section of the Bois de Boulogne that he had purchased in 1777. He made a wager with his sister-in-law, Marie Antoinette, that he could build a ch\u00e2teau where she could be entertained in less than three months. Construction of the little ch\u00e2teau began on 21 September and was finished on 26 November. The chateau was the work of the architect Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph B\u00e9langer, while the garden was made by the Scottish landscape designer Thomas Blaikie. The garden was built at the same time as the Parc Monceau, and, like that garden, it was filled with fabriques and follies, including a hill made of rocks crowned by a \"Pavilion of Philosophers\" that was half-Gothic and half-Chinese; an obelisk, a bridge surmounted by a pagoda, Gothic ruins, a tatar tent and a spiral labyrinth. All the follies gradually disappeared, and the park became a more traditional English garden. The pavilion on top of the pile of rocks was replaced by a more traditional structure. During the Second Empire, the Pavilion of Eug\u00e9nie in the rose garden was added, in honor of the frequent visits to the garden of the Empress of Napoleon III.Jarrass\u00e9, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, pp. 82\u201383."]}]}}
