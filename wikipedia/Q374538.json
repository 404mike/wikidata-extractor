He became legendary in the RAF for his role in the defence of Malta and was described by the then Air Officer Commanding in Chief Middle East, Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, as 'the most important pilot in the RAF'. Warburton was also awarded a United States DFC. Described as 'Six-medal Warburton', all of Warby's gallantry awards were earned while operating from Malta. He remains the most highly decorated RAF photo-reconnaissance pilot of all time.\nHis life and work has been depicted in the books Warburton's War by Tony Spooner, and Malta's Greater Siege & Adrian Warburton DSO* DFC** DFC (USA) by Paul McDonald.

The RAF also early developed the standard three-phase interpretation procedure: first phase required immediate response (such as advancing columns of armor sighted); second phase required 24- hour handling (such as concentrations of landing craft in ports); and third phase was for long-term analysis (such as industrial targets like coal gasification plants). Also, the distinction between strategic and tactical reconnaissance became clear, and sub-specialties like weather reconnaissance, radar photography, and bomb-damage assessment (BDA) became current. Both sides developed programs of regular weather reconnaissance in the Atlantic. In addition, the technique widely known as \u201cdicing\u201d \u2013 extreme low-altitude photography at high speed \u2013 came to be adopted by the Allies for special work.Hansen, 280\u2013281"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Warburton", "response": ["* Adrian Warburton (1918\u20131944), English RAF Wing Commander"]}, {"page": "Warby", "response": ["* nickname of Adrian Warburton (1918\u20131944), Second World War Royal Air Force flying ace"]}]}}
