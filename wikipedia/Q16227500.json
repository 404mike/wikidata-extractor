He said Arabs was a rare \"combination of commanding erudition and swashbuckling prose\". \"[Mackintosh-Smith] writes with wonderful verve. Idioms and irreverence abound,\" he added. Marozzi nevertheless was mildy critical of the editing, \"[u]ndoubtedly brilliant, his book might have benefited from a sharper editorial knife,\" he explained. He encouraged readers to buy the book to support the author as he, according to his website, was \"impecunious\".  Arabs was listed in The Sunday Times best history books for 2019 where it was described as \"sumptuous\" and written with \"infectious enthusiasm\".  Writing for The Times (sister paper of The Sunday Times), Richard Spencer made a similar note to Marozzi regarding the book's need for more editing. Nevertheless, his review was also favorable, describing Arabs as a \"sweeping book\" that employs \"meticulous scholarship\" and \" addresses vital questions of Arab identity and nationhood\". He also praised the author, attributing to him \"nearmythical status among western observers of the Middle East\".
