A lieutenant by the outbreak of war with revolutionary France in 1793, Hotham served initially in the Mediterranean, and had been promoted to his first command by 1794. He saw action with his uncle Lord Hotham's fleet at the Battle of Hy\u00e8res Islands in 1795, after which he returned home, taking command of the 50-gun HMS Adamant shortly before the mutiny at the Nore. His ship and Admiral Adam Duncan's flagship were the only two deckers to remain loyal, and the only two ships left to enforce the blockade of the Dutch coast. Despite their severe disadvantage in numbers, Hotham and Admiral Duncan were able to trick the Dutch to stay in port through use of false signals. After this, Hotham continued to serve with Duncan in the North Sea, and took part in his victory at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797.\nAfter further service in the English Channel Hotham went out to the Cape of Good Hope, taking part in the blockade of the French possessions in the Indian Ocean, and in 1799 helping to destroy the French frigate Preneuse.  Taking command of HMS Raisonnable shortly after the end of the temporary Peace of Amiens, Hotham served in the Channel until ill health forced him to resign his command and go ashore. Though he briefly commanded a unit of Sea Fencibles, and later the yacht HMS Royal Sovereign, no seagoing command could be found for him. He spent the rest of the wars ashore, being promoted through the ranks, and being appointed first a Knight Commander and then a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. William Hotham died in 1848 at the age of 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Hotham", "response": ["Several admirals of the Royal Navy were named William Hotham:", "* William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham (1736\u20131813), Royal Navy admiral", "* Sir William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1772), Royal Navy admiral", "* William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1794), Royal Navy admiral"]}, {"page": "Admiral Hotham", "response": ["*William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham (1736\u20131813), Royal Navy admiral", "*William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1772), Royal Navy admiral", "*William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1794), Royal Navy admiral"]}, {"page": "William Hotham (1772 - 1848)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1772)"]}, {"page": "William Hotham (1772-1848)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1772)"]}, {"page": "William Hotham (1772\u20131848)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1772)"]}, {"page": "List of Royal Navy admirals (1707\u2013current)", "response": ["|William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham", "|Sir William Hotham, GCB", "| William Hotham, KH"]}, {"page": "William Hotham (Royal Navy officer, born 1794)", "response": ["Admiral William Hotham, KH (30 July 1794 \u2013 22 February 1873) was a British Royal Navy officer.", "He was born in Yorkshire, the eldest son of Lieutenant-Colonel George Hotham and Caroline Gee.
