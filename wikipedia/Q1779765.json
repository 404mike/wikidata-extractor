Three years later, Holloway issued the album All It Takes."]}, {"page": "The Contours", "response": ["In the early 1970s, Joe Billingslea resurrected the group with himself, Arthur Hinson, Martin Upshire, C. Autry Hatcher and former Motown Contour Council Gay as its members, and began performing at local clubs around Detroit. During the seventies and early eighties, the group's popularity increased and they began playing dates throughout the US and even some international dates. In 1984, Charles Davis replaced Hinson and a week later Potts rejoined the group replacing Gay. In 1987, Hatcher left the group and Arthur Hinson returned. In 1988, Darell Nunlee was added when Martin Upshire left. The same year, \"Do You Love Me\" was prominently featured in the film Dirty Dancing. In 1988, a reissue of \"Do You Love Me\" sent the song back to the Billboard Top 40 charts for eight weeks, peaking at number eleven. The movie and the record spawned a 1988 \"Dirty Dancing Concert Tour\" followed by a new recording contract for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records where the group recorded two albums Flashback and Revenge although the latter was not released, though the songs would later be featured on the later compilation, The Best of the Contours."]}, {"page": "The Undisputed Truth", "response": ["In 1990, Joe Harris and Brenda Evans revived the group with singer Belita Woods, and recorded for Ian Levine's Motown revival label Motorcity Records. They recorded a new version of their 1973 song \"Law of the Land\", which was released as a 12\" single (the group's last ever single) in 1991. Members Billie Calvin and Vee McDonald also made separate solo recordings for the same label, and all three feature on the Tribute to Norman Whitfield album, a Motorcity compilation CD released in September 1996. McDonald recorded a song entitled \"You're My Loveline\" (co-written by former Motown lyricists Janie Bradford and Marilyn McLeod), which was released in the UK. Joe Harris continues to perform and has recently worked with the UK-based Stone Foundation band."]}, {"page": "Kim Weston", "response": ["Along with many former Motown artists, she signed with Ian Levine's Motorcity Records in the 1980s, releasing the single \"Signal Your Intention\", which peaked at No. 1 in the UK Hi-NRG chart. It was followed by the album Investigate (1990), which included some re-recordings of her Motown hits as well as new material. A second album for the label, Talking Loud (1992), was never released, although all the songs were included on the compilation The Best Of Kim Weston (1996)."]}, {"page": "Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers", "response": ["Taylor later successfully sued Motown for a substantial amount of money. Despite that, the group's recording of \"The Bells I Hear\", the song they recorded which Marvin Gaye, who produced the track, shelved and reformulated into two separate tracks by The Originals' \"Baby I'm For Real\" and \"The Bells\", found on the two-volume CD Motown Sings Motown Treasures, has become increasingly popular. Moving to the United Kingdom, Taylor started an offshoot group, Bobby Taylor & the New Vancouvers, and recorded an album for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records. His later musical efforts were tempered by bouts with throat cancer, which he had treated by various holistic doctors."]}, {"page": "G. C.

He recorded a critically acclaimed album for Malaco Records in 1983 and his career was revived in 1989 by recordings for British record companies Ardent (owned at the time by Paul Mooney) and Motorcity (owned by Ian Levine). He also recorded another solo album titled Shadows. Shadows was co-produced by Ben Obi of Savannah Street Music."]}, {"page": "Amanda Lear", "response": ["A series of re-recordings of her old hits appeared on the market in the late 1980s, starting with a synthpop take of the biggest hit, \"Follow Me\", in 1987. The following year, Italian band CCCP Fedeli alla linea recorded a cover of her song \"Tomorrow\", retitled \"Tomorrow (Voulez-vous un rendez-vous)\", for which Lear contributed guest vocals. The single was a minor hit in Italy and Amanda's first chart success in that country in six years. In 1989, DJ Ian Levine remixed \"Follow Me\" and \"Gold\" in a Hi-NRG fashion, while Lear hosted Ars Amanda on Rai 3, an Italian chat show where she interviewed both Italian and international celebrities and politicians in bed. From the late 1980s, Lear has been a regular participant in the popular French radio show Les Grosses T\u00eates on RTL, televised on Paris Premi\u00e8re. To maintain her popularity in Italy, she recorded Uomini pi\u00f9 uomini, an all-Italian language album, which included mainstream pop material written among others by , Paolo Conte's brother No single was released to promote the album and it turned out a commercial failure. The same year, Amanda re-recorded some of the songs in French and cut the dance single \"M\u00e9tamorphose\" for the French-Italian re-release of the album Tant qu'il y aura des hommes.

Levi Stubbs' brother Joe called Levi over to record the song, and both brothers feature on the track, along with singers Sammy Ward, Cal Gill of The Velvelettes, Carolyn Crawford and C.P.

Several separate accounts offer differing versions of who actually authored the story. Most accounts agree that series fan and continuity advisor Ian Levine suggested a number of plot elements. At one extreme, it is suggested that the story was authored by series script editor Eric Saward, with or without substantial input by Levine, with Woolsey only acting as the story's author to prevent problems with the Writers' Guild of Great Britain, who objected to script editors editing their own scripts. Alternatively, it is suggested that Woolsey originated the story, but that Saward heavily rewrote it in his capacity as script editor. Levine claims that Saward wrote the dialogue to Levine's story and plot, and that Woolsey \"did not write one single word of that script\". In a 2004 interview with Doctor Who Magazine, Saward responded that he \"effectively\" wrote the script himself, incorporating Levine's story outline, with a \"minor contribution\" from Woolsey."]}, {"page": "The Originals (band)", "response": ["Although the group went on to have more modest success in both the soul and disco fields near the end of the decade, including \"Down to Love Town\", a No. 1 dance chart hit, the songs they made with Marvin Gaye are arguably their most memorable and notable. Spencer returned briefly in the late 1970s, but after the death of Ty Hunter, on February 24, 1981, the group ceased recording and broke up about a year later. The group had left Motown in 1977, releasing two albums for Columbia and their final album for the independent label Phase II. They later reunited and recorded for Ian Levine's Motorcity Records; the group recorded several songs together including \"Take The Only Way Out\" which was scheduled for a single release, and individual members (including former member Joe Stubbs) also made some solo recordings. The group duetted with former Motown labelmates The Supremes for one single, \"Back By Popular Demand\" in 1991.

Levine selected one clip from all of the previous Doctors, save for Jon Pertwee who never had a Cyberman story (though they had been briefly glimpsed in two serials from his era). Levine's selected clips were: the First Doctor from episode 2 of The Tenth Planet (1966), the Second Doctor from episode 6 of The Wheel in Space (1968) (with dialogue from the Earthshock Cyber Leader referring to The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), at that time missing from the BBC archives) and the Fourth Doctor from part 3 of Revenge Of The Cybermen (1975). All the clips were presented in monochrome to preserve continuity, as the first two extracts were originally recorded in black and white."]}]}}
