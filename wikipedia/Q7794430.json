He was the eldest of seven children, four of whom also played the harp, most notably his brother Thomas Thomas. John Thomas started off by playing the triple harp, which had three sets of strings and was very difficult to play. At the age of 14, through the influence of Ada Lovelace, (Lord Byron's daughter), he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music in London. His teachers there included Cipriani Potter for composition and John Balsir Chatterton for harp."]}, {"page": "1913 in Wales", "response": ["*date unknown - Thomas Thomas (apTommas), harpist and younger brother of John Thomas, 82/3"]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Thomas Thomas (disambiguation), multiple people", "**Thomas Thomas (cleric) (1804\u20131877), Welsh cleric (\"Thomas of Caernarfon\")", "**Thomas Thomas (harpist) (1829\u20131913), Welsh harpist and composer-arranger", "**Thomas Thomas (boxer) (1880\u20131911), Welsh; first UK middleweight boxing champion", "**Thomas Thomas (surgeon) (1917\u20131998), Indian thoracic surgeon and writer", "**Thomas Thomas (trade unionist), Singaporean politician"]}, {"page": "Thomas Thomas", "response": ["Thomas Thomas is the name of:", "* Thomas Thomas (harpist) (1829\u20131913), Welsh", "* Thomas Thomas (trade unionist), Singaporean politician", "* Thomas Thomas (architect) (1817\u20131888), Welsh church minister and chapel architect", "* Thomas Thomas (priest) (1804\u20131877), Welsh cleric (\"Thomas of Caernarfon\")", "* Thomas Thomas (boxer) (1880\u20131911), first UK middleweight boxing champion", "* Thomas Thomas (surgeon) (1917\u20131998), Indian thoracic surgeon and writer", "* Thomas Thomas, senior architect at T.
