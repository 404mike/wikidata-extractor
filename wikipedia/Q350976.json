He made his Aston Villa debut, starting the whole game, in a 1\u20130 loss against West Ham United in the opening game of the season. After a bad start, it was announced on 15 September 2012 that Vlaar was named captain for the 2012\u201313 season in the continued absence of club captain Stiliyan Petrov, as the Bulgarian battled cancer. His first game as captain resulted in Aston Villa's first win of the season, a 2\u20130 win over Swansea City on 15 September 2012. He then spoke about his responsibility as a captain but faced new challenges as a captain in \"a different league, different language and different culture.\" In the first thirteen league matches of the season, Vlaar established himself in the centre\u2013back position, forming a partnership with Ciaran Clark. However, he suffered a calf injury during a match against Arsenal on 24 November 2012 and was substituted in the 51st minute, as Aston Villa drew 0\u20130. After a scan, Vlaar was out for two months with the injury. It wasn't until on 19 January 2013 when he made his return to the starting line\u2013up against West Bromwich Albion and helped the club draw 2\u20132. However, after making five starts for Aston Villa, Vlaar suffered a calf injury while in training and missed two matches as a result. But he made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Reading on 9 March 2013 and helped the club win 2\u20131. Following his return from injury, Vlaar regained his first team place for the rest of the 2012\u201313 season, forming a partnership with Clark and helping Aston Villa fight for survival to avoid relegation in the Premier League. On 29 April 2013, he scored his first goal for the club with a 30-yard strike in a 6\u20131 victory over Sunderland. In a match against already relegated Wigan Athletic in the last game of the season, Vlaar scored his second goal for Aston Villa, scoring from a spectacular half-volley from just inside the penalty area, in a 2\u20132 draw away. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, he went on to make thirty\u2013one appearances and scoring two times in all competitions. Reflecting on his first season at the club, Vlaar said while avoiding relegation in the Premier League, he does expect the youngsters in the team that they must learn from their mistakes and hoping that Aston Villa does not found themselves in the relegation zone next season. However, Vlaar later said: \"It wasn't an easy season. It was my first season in the Premier League and at Aston Villa, but I could do better I think. I expect more from myself. When we have a new season, I think it's going to be better. I'm never completely satisfied with the way I play, I always look for things to improve. I want to be better in personal battles, I want to win more headers, I want to make less mistakes. I just need to be better. I think with practice you can do a lot. You train like you play so it's 100 per cent every day.\""]}, {"page": "List of UEFA European Championship goalscorers", "response": ["* Ciaran Clark (scored for Sweden in 2016)"]}, {"page": "Republic of Ireland national football team \u2013 record in major tournaments", "response": ["| Darren Randolph; S\u00e9amus Coleman, John O'Shea (c.), Ciaran Clark, Robbie Brady; James McCarthy (Aiden McGeady 85'), Glenn Whelan, Jeff Hendrick, Wes Hoolahan (Robbie Keane 78'); Jonathan Walters (James McClean 64'), Shane Long", "| Darren Randolph; S\u00e9amus Coleman, John O'Shea (c.), Ciaran Clark, Stephen Ward; Jeff Hendrick, Glenn Whelan, James McCarthy (James McClean 62'), Robbie Brady; Wes Hoolahan (Aiden McGeady 71'); Shane Long (Robbie Keane 79')"]}, {"page": "Ian Evatt", "response": ["Evatt was named in the \"Team of the Week\" for week fourteen of the campaign, sharing the centre-back role with Aston Villa's Ciaran Clark.http://www.premierleague.com/page/TeamOfTheWeek/0,,12306~2233760,00.html "]}]}}
