Six months after the first Biggles stories were published they were collected in book form in The Camels are Coming.  During the Second World War, Johns worked for the Air Ministry; the ministry asked him to create a female character to boost recruitment into the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, which resulted in the publication of the Worrals stories and books.
