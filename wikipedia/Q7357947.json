In 1972, academic Roger Cardinal introduced \"outsider art\" as the American counterpart of \"L'Art Brut\", which originally referred to work created exclusively by children or the mentally ill. The word \"outsider\" began to be applied to music cultures as early as 1959, with respect to jazz,Charles Winick, \"The Use of Drugs by Jazz Musicians\", Social Problems 7, no. 3 (Winter 1959\u20131960): 240\u201353.

Tirilly's oeuvre stands among the strongest contemporary examples of Art Brut in Europe. His deft technique and unusual sense of vision and purpose, however, stand in sharp contrast to the commonly prescribed features of Art Brut, notably autodidacticism and dissociativism. As such, Tirilly is also a proponent of Marginal or Singular Art (in French, L'art singulier), an art current that eschews many of the habitual artistic qualifiers be they subject, style, method, or purpose.
