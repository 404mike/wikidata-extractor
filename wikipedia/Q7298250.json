He marked his arrival at Stoke by scoring against his old club Wolves in his second match for the club. He formed a decent midfielder partnership with Ray Wallace as Stoke made a push for promotion to the Premier League in 1995\u201396 season. Unfortunately for Keen he picked up an injury against Luton Town in April 1996 and he missed the rest of the season. Stoke made the end of season play-offs and lost out 1\u20130 to Leicester City. He struggled for starts in 1996\u201397 as he recovered from his injury but was a regular in 1997\u201398 in what was Stoke's first season at the Britannia Stadium. He scored the winning goal in the first Potteries derby at the new stadium but it was a terrible season for Stoke as they finished in 23rd position and were relegated to Division Two. He played in 49 of the club's 52 fixtures in 1998\u201399 as Stoke failed to mount a consistent promotion challenge under Brian Little. He spent one more season at Stoke before leaving for Macclesfield Town."]}, {"page": "Ray (given name)", "response": ["* Ray Wallace (footballer) (born 1969), English footballer"]}]}}
