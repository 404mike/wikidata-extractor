In the quarter-finals, Inverness defeated Ayr, winning 3\u20131 in the first leg, and drawing 1\u20131 in the second, securing a comfortable 4\u20132 aggregate win. However, the joy was short-lived after facing Dundee United in the semi-finals. In the first leg, at home, they fell to an unfortunate 1\u20130 loss while down to 10 men after Liam Polworth was handed a straight red for an apparent high foot on Mark Connolly while making a clearance. Inverness went to Tannadice with heads held high hoping to overturn the 1\u20130 deficit, but hope began to fade after United were awarded and scored a controversial penalty just before half time. The penalty was conceded by a Brad McKay handball, after it deflected off his heel. Again, controversy followed just after half time, when a handball wasn't seen by the referee which resulted in John Robertson being sent to the stands for flicking a water-bottle in aggravation near the 4th official. Inverness went on to lose 3\u20130, 4\u20130 on aggregate. After the match, Robertson stated in an interview with the BBC on what punishments he'd receive from the SFA for his actions;\"I don't care. They [the SFA] can ban me for as long as they want. I'm going to start speaking out now because I've had enough of it.\"", "*  Liam Polworth (Scotland U-17 & Scotland U-21) 2011\u20132019"]}, {"page": "Richie Foran", "response": ["May was a better month for the Irishman making substitute appearances in the last 3 games of the season a 3\u20132 home loss against Dundee United F.C. and a 1\u20130 away win at Hamilton. He scored a penalty during the final day of the season against Dundee F.C. in a battle for seventh place after Liam Polworth got brought down in the box. He scored the resulting penalty it was the fourth goal it was his also his first goal since November 2013 the game ended 4-0 a result that secured 7th place in The SPFL. Another reason fans knew it was a special moment as Foran stated 24 hours before that he would like regular first team football if he were to continue being a football player and felt he would not get that at Inverness. Leading to speculation that he would leave along with David Raven who was nearing the end of his contract. Raven had fallen out with manager John Hughes. It did turn out to be his final goal not just for Inverness Caledonian Thistle but his last goal as a player. However, even though Foran took the penalty, the crowd were calling for him to let David Raven take it, due to him becoming a club hero because of his goal that sent Inverness into the Scottish Cup final the previous year, in the end Foran took the penalty and Raven stayed at the club, while manager at the time, John Hughes, left the club after a fall out, due to the lack of star players staying at the club, with Richie taking the reins the next week."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["| 31|||| MF|| Liam Polworth"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["| 21|||| MF|| Liam Polworth"]}, {"page": "PFA Scotland Team of the Year", "response": ["| MF || Liam Polworth || Inverness Caledonian Thistle ||align=\"center\"|1"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["| 20|||| MF|| Liam Polworth"]}, {"page": "2015 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||20 ||  Liam Polworth"]}]}}
