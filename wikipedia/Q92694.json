ATM cells are transmitted from base stations to mobile terminals. Mobility functions are performed at an ATM switch in the core network, known as \"crossover switch\",Book on Wireless ATM Networks - Chai Keong Toh, Kluwer Academic Press 1997 which is similar to the MSC (mobile switching center) of GSM networks. The advantage of wireless ATM is its high bandwidth and high speed handoffs done at layer 2. In the early 1990s, Bell Labs and NECWATMnet: a prototype wireless ATM system for multimedia personal communication,  D. Raychaudhuri,at.al research labs worked actively in this field. Andy Hopper from Cambridge University Computer Laboratory also worked in this area. There was a wireless ATM forum formed to standardize the technology behind wireless ATM networks. The forum was supported by several telecommunication companies, including NEC, Fujitsu and AT&T. Mobile ATM aimed to provide high speed multimedia communications technology, capable of delivering broadband mobile communications beyond that of GSM and WLANs."]}, {"page": "Ubiquitous computing", "response": ["Andy Hopper from Cambridge University UK proposed and demonstrated the concept of \"Teleporting\" \u2013 where applications follow the user wherever he/she moves.", "Roy Want, while a researcher and student working under Andy Hopper at Cambridge University, worked on the \"Active Badge System\", which is an advanced location computing system where personal mobility that is merged with computing."]}, {"page": "Acorn Computers", "response": ["Around this time, CPU and Andy Hopper set up Orbis Ltd. to commercialise the Cambridge Ring networking system Hopper had worked on for his PhD, but it was soon decided to bring him into CPU as a director because he could promote CPU's interests at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.
