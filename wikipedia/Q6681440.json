Cousin has performed with artists such as Madonna, Missy Elliott, Stella McCartney, and Brian Cox. Lorne Cousin and his group of kilt-wearing bagpipe players were the only male-led group to perform on the main stage at the 2007 Los Angeles Women's Music Festival.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Into the Groove", "response": ["Three years later on the Blond Ambition World Tour, \"Into the Groove\" was again performed before the encore. Madonna, her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory were portrayed as being seduced by three macho guys in leather jackets. The girls asked the guys to \"prove their love to them\" and wondered if they would wear a condom when necessary. After that, they sing the Shep Pettibone extended remix of \"Into The Groove\". Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition\u00a0\u2013 Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. In the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, Madonna included the song at the start of the final segment, which started with Scottish bagpiper players parading around the stage in kilts and playing drums and pipes. Madonna appeared onstage in similar long kilts and a white sleeveless T-shirt to perform \"Into the Groove\" with Scottish bagpiper group Lorne Cousin. Rapper Missy Elliott appeared on the video screen for a rap interlude."]}, {"page": "Re-Invention World Tour", "response": ["According to Caresse Henry, one of the \"major complaints\" fans had regarding the Drowned World Tour (2001) was the lack of the singer's \"classic hits\", thus \"[Madonna] came to the conclusion that it was time to perform more of her entire repertoire\". During an interview with TRL, Madonna explained: \"we\u2019re talking old and new [...] I\u2019m going to be doing songs from my entire career, like they\u2019ve never been done before. Because that\u2019s what life is all about\". The title Re-Invention was, according to Christianity Magazine, a \"self-confident, ambivalent dig at all the people who for years have talked about [Madonna] 'reinventing herself'\"; the singer said she chose this name because she wanted to capture \"the irony [of my old songs] [...] the only way I could do them was by re-inventing them, approach them from another angle\". Described as \"much lighter in tone\" than the Drowned World Tour, its central theme was \"unity vs. violence\". Henry described it as a \"brilliant performance show [...] extravagant, but more in line with how shows used to be and scaled back, but filled with plenty of eye candy\". Like past tours of the artist, it was divided into five different thematic acts: Marie Antoinette, Military, Circus, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. Jamie King was once again appointed creative director. Other personnel included Madonna's lifelong backup singer and dancer Donna De Lory, vocalist Siedah Garrett, bagpiper Lorne Cousin, Monte Pittman on guitar, Stuart Price as keyboards player and 12 dancers, including three trapeze artists. Auditions for dancers took place from February to March in New York and Los Angeles's Culver Studios, with rehearsals taking place at the Great Western Forum. Allan Dekko was selected to choreograph the performance of \"Express Yourself\" (1989), which was given a military theme. Of working with the singer, Dekko recalled that \"I won't say that she is a natural, but what is being asked of her she did well [...] I found her pleasant to work with\". Production cost $1 million: the stage had a center stage turntable 42 feet in diameter that could rise up to 10 feet in height and spin up to 15 miles per hour, as well as a conveyor belt built into the entire front section, used by the singer to move from one extreme to the other on certain numbers. Five moving video screens - three big ones, the largest of which was 7 tons, and two slightly smaller ones - that were moved by 160 motors formed the backdrop. Equipment also included 130 rigging points, an arsenal of moving lights and four tons worth of Claire Brothers line array sound system; also present was a 22 meter, V-shaped truss catwalk that was lowered from the ceiling above the front of the audience. Props for the show included a half-pipe skateboarding ramp and an electric chair. Images and footage from X-STaTIC PRO=CeSS were used as backdrop videos. ", "The final segment, Scottish-Tribal, started with bagpipers marching around the stage in kilts. Madonna then appeared onstage wearing a white T-shirt and a kilt to perform the \"Into the Hollywood Groove\" remix of \"Into the Groove\" with Lorne Cousin and rapper Missy Elliott onscreen. She then performed \"Papa Don't Preach\" decked out in a black T-shirt with the line \"Kabbalists Do It Better\" \u2015 on certain shows, the T-shirt read \"Midwesterners Do It Better\", \"Italians Do It Better\", \"Irish Do It Better\" and \"Brits Do It Better\", respectively. Next came \"Crazy for You\", which the singer dedicated to her fans. The final numbers were \"Music\" and \"Holiday\"; the former was set to a slower, hip-hop mix and had a lighted staircases surrounding a DJ, while the latter had the singer and dancers walk on top of the catwalk as confetti fell from the roof. At the end, the screens flashed out the phrase \"Reinvent Yourself\".", "*Lorne Cousin - bagpipes"]}, {"page": "Celtic fusion", "response": ["The genre of Celtic electronica blends traditional Celtic influences with modern electronic music.  Artists such as Martyn Bennett, Lorne Cousin, Mouth Music, Mark Saul and Saint Sister whose backgrounds are in traditional Celtic music tend to favor traditional instruments, melodies, and rhythms, but augment them with drum machines and electronic sounds.  Others, like Dagda, Brigid Boden and Niteworks approach the fusion from a background in electronic music that eschews traditional instruments and incorporates traditional melodies played on synths into a New Age-influenced trance sound.
