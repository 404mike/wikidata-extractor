He joined Middlesbrough in 1954 and became a regular in the side in 1958 alongside Brian Clough. Clough scored the majority of the goals, partly due to Peacock's unselfish attitude in front of goal. Clough joined Sunderland in 1961 and the following season Peacock scored 24 in 34 games.\nPeacock's high scoring rate earned him a place in the 1962 World Cup England squad. He made his international debut in the Group Four victory over Argentina. Since then only Allan Clarke in 1970 has made his debut in a World Cup finals match. In total, he earned 6 caps and scored 3 goals for England, two of which came in a 4\u20130 victory over Wales in November 1962.\nIn 1964 he moved to Leeds United for \u00a355,000 to help Don Revie's team with promotion, which was achieved that season with Peacock scoring 8 goals in 14 games. He stayed at Leeds for a further three seasons scoring 30 goals in 65 games, yet more frequent injuries forced his sale to Plymouth Argyle for \u00a310,000 in 1967 where he played only one season before being forced to retire due to injuries at only 30 years old in 1968. He returned to his home town after retirement.\nPeacock wore the number-9 shirt, and recently sold his newsagents shop in Ormesby, Middlesbrough, having owned it for forty years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["* Alan Peacock (141)"]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["United secured promotion as champions of the Second Division in 1963\u201364, helped by the late signing of striker Alan Peacock from Middlesbrough for \u00a353,000. However the overly physical approach typified by captain Collins earned Leeds a reputation as \"dirty\" that would shadow the club throughout Revie's tenure as manager and continue to this day. Leeds adapted well to the First Division early in the 1964\u201365 campaign, but caused controversy in Collins's return to Goodison Park as the game against Everton descended into a brawl and the referee ordered the players off the field after 35 minutes to prevent further violence. Leeds went on to maintain a strong title challenge, finishing second to rivals Manchester United on goal average after failing to beat Birmingham City on the last day of the season. They also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2\u20131 to Liverpool at Wembley after extra-time.", "The combative nature of his teams earned United the moniker of \"dirty Leeds\", as key player Eddie Gray admitted that \"it was brutal stuff and, definitely win-at-all-costs\". Alan Peacock said that one of the attractions for joining Leeds was that he would not have to play against them and \"then they won't be kicking me\". In 1963 Leeds were labelled by the Football Association's own FA News as \"the dirtiest [team] in the Football League\". On more than one occasion referees had to order Leeds players off the pitch for a break mid-match to break up mass brawls. His teams were also notorious for dour play and playing to defend 1\u20130 leads, though he did allow a more attacking style later in his career. Nevertheless, the unpopularity and poor reputation stuck with Leeds throughout Revie's time as manager and even was in evidence after his death. George Best said that he \"hated playing against them\" and that the only time he needed to wear shinpads was when he was playing against Leeds."]}, {"page": "England national football team records and statistics", "response": ["; Last player to debut at the World Cup finalsAllan Clarke also scored England's goal on his debut.

The opening sixteen minutes saw three Leeds players, Billy Bremner, Charlton and Jim Storrie require treatment as they struggled to impose themselves on the match.  Liverpool continued to press forward and an attack was thwarted when St John was dispossessed by Collins, who passed the ball back to Sprake. Leeds striker Alan Peacock fouled Smith following Sprake's clearance and Liverpool were able to build another attack, but St John's subsequent shot went wide of the Leeds goal. Leeds had an attack in the eighteenth minute, but Bremner's pass to Paul Reaney was intercepted by Liverpool goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence. Leeds began to grow in confidence and minutes later, Collins had a chance, but his shot from  went wide of the Liverpool goal. Minutes later, Leeds had another chance to score.
