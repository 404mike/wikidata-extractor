Its 19th-century success peaked with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and work by E. T. A. Hoffmann, Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Dickens, and in poetry with Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Also prominent was the later Dracula by Bram Stoker and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson. The name Gothic spread from the Goths to mean \"German\".
