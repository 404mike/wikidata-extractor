She took a job in Brighton, and has a blog that she started during the production of My Transsexual Summer. In the spring of 2013, she started HRT. 2013 was also the inaugural year of Trans* Pride Brighton, the first transgender pride festival in the UK, and she and Fox Fisher served on the organisation committee. In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. \"Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I never... did anything creative,\" said Sarah in a 2013 interview. \"For some reason... living in a female role has allowed me to be more creative.\"", "Lewis Hancox' fundraising events attracted donations from TV viewers; among those who gave to the cause were Stephen Fry and Graham Norton. Later that year, Lewis began preparing for a more complicated gender-confirmation surgery: metoidioplasty. Lewis moved to London to study Digital Film and Video at London South Bank University. In 2013, he and Fox Fisher started the My Genderation project, in which they make short documentaries about transgender people and gender variance. Their production company is called Lucky Tooth Films. The Independent on Sunday placed Lewis and Fox on their Pink List for 2013 (a list of \"101 gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people that make a difference\"), and on the Rainbow List in 2015. (The Pink List was renamed to Rainbow List in 2014). In 2014, The Guardian included Lewis on their \"30 under 30\" list of \"top young people in digital media\".", "Fox Fisher (aka Raphael Fox) continued to work as a freelance screen printer and visual artist. In addition to their creative projects with Lewis and Sarah, Fox wrote a few pieces for The Huffington Post. Like Sarah, they felt a new creative freedom from transitioning: \"It's easier to make art now because I feel like I've got a huge chunk of my life out of the way.\" In 2014, Fox spoke at TEDxBrighton, and was nominated for the alumnus award at the University of Brighton, where they were a Master of Arts student. Fox completed a Master's degree in Sequential Design and Illustration in 2015. In July 2017, the university granted them an honorary doctorate \"in recognition of their major contribution to raising the profile, both nationally and internationally, of issues affecting trans people and the promotion of arts in the media\". Fox is active in the media as a trans spokesperson, consultant, actor, and filmmaker. They have spoken about trans issues on Good Morning Britain, Inside Out, and This Morning."]}, {"page": "Laura Kate Dale", "response": ["* \"Radically vulnerable insights into the lived experience of being trans . . . Will inspire hope and joy in trans people and allies alike\" Fox Fisher", "Dale collaborated with former founder of the Trans Rights Collective UK (disbanded in 2020), Felix Fern, in 2021 to co-organise a 'trans rights' protest outside Downing Street in London on 6 August 2021, calling on the government to implement better rights and equality for transgender and non-binary people in the United Kingdom. The protest featured a roster of speakers including prominent UK trans activists such as Fox Fisher and Roz Kaveney as well as Dale herself, and was attended by the British human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell."]}]}}
