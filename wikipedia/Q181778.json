This has led several scholars to question its authenticity, and suggest that it is an interpolation.David Luckensmeyer,The Eschatology of First Thessalonians, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2013 pp.16fff. According to Pieter Willem van der Horst, there is an instance of antisemitic statements in one of the Pauline epistles; David Luckensmeyer maintains that it was not written with the intent to condemn all Jews, Paul's letters reveal someone who lived his life within Judaism, but did at the same time have an antisemitic effect.David Luckensmeyer. pp.167-171. F. F. Bruce called it an 'indiscriminate anti-Jewish polemic' mirroring Graeco-Roman pagan attitudes to the Jews. Gene Green, Ernest Best, T. Holtz, Amy Downey variously argue that it resonates with Old Testament themes, plays on Jewish fears of being the \"privileged people of God\" and typical of an argumentative style shared by Greeks and Jews alike and thus, in Downey's words, exemplifying an intracultural clash between Paul the Jew and Jewish leaders opposing the propagation of Gospel ideas in both Judea and Thessalonia.Amy Karen Downey,  Paul's Conundrum: Reconciling 1 Thessalonians 2:13-16 and Romans 9:1-5 in Light of His Calling and His Heritage, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2011 pp.61ff,66-7."]}, {"page": "John the Apostle", "response": ["Regarding whether the author of the Gospel of John was an eyewitness, according to Paul N.

This pastiche theory was promoted by F. F. Bruce (1974), who saw the story of the young man of Bethany clumsily based on the raising of Lazarus in the Gospel of John. Thus, he saw the Secret Mark narrative as derivative and denied that it could be either the source of the story of Lazarus or an independent parallel. Raymond E. Brown (1974) came to the conclusion that the author of Secret Mark \"may well have drawn upon\" the Gospel of John, \"at least from memory\". Patrick W. Skehan (1974) supported this view, calling the reliance on John \"unmistakable\". Robert M. Grant (1974) thought that Smith definitely had proved that the letter was written by Clement, but found in Secret Mark elements from each of the four canonical gospels, and arrived at the conclusion that it was written after the first century. Helmut Merkel (1974) also concluded that Secret Mark is dependent on the four canonical gospels after analyzing the key Greek phrases, and that even if the letter is genuine it tells us nothing more than that an expanded version of Mark was in existence in Alexandria in AD 170. Frans Neirynck (1979) argued that Secret Mark was virtually \u201dcomposed with the assistance of a concordance of the\u201d canonical gospels and wholly dependent on them. N. T.
