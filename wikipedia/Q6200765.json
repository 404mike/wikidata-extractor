Responsibility for the Lockerbie investigation thus rested with Jimmy McDougall, the Procurator Fiscal in the nearby burgh of Dumfries, and with the Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, by number of officers the smallest police force in the UK. According to a paper presented by the then Lord Advocate Colin Boyd, to a conference of law officers in 2001,  the ordinary resources available to them were inadequate to deal with such an investigation."]}, {"page": "James McDougall", "response": ["James, Jim or Jimmy McDougall or MacDougall may refer to:", "* Jimmy McDougall (footballer) (1904\u20131984), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle, Liverpool FC and Scotland)", "* Jimmy McDougall, Scottish Procurator Fiscal, responsible for investigating the crash of Pan Am Flight 103"]}, {"page": "McDougall", "response": ["*Jimmy McDougall, Scottish lawyer"]}]}}
