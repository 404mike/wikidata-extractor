He was a prominent right-handed batsman and an occasional medium pace lob bowler.  He was a good fielder who played in some matches as a wicketkeeper.\nAlways known by his initials, E. H. Budd was one of sixteen children of William Budd and his wife Ann (n\u00e9e Hayward). His maternal grandfather was the Rector of Uley, in Gloucestershire. At the age of 16 he was appointed to a clerkship in the War Office, from which he retired early after approximately twenty years' service.He first played at Lord's in about 1804 and by 1807 was frequently engaged in matches there. His height was barely 5'10\" and his weight for many years was uniformly 12 stone.Budd's first-class career was disrupted by the Napoleonic War, especially during the 1811 to 1815 seasons.  He is first recorded by Scores & Biographies in the 1802 season, in an \"odds\" match; and by CricketArchive in the 1803 season, in a match that is not universally regarded as first-class.  He played for All-England Eleven versus Marylebone Cricket Club in 1804 and then made sporadic appearances until 1808 when his career took off.  He continued playing until 1831.\nOne of his early appearances was for the Gentlemen in the second Gentlemen v Players match in 1806.He was a member of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and that was his main team, though he also played for All-England and for various occasional elevens, including his own.  He rarely played for any county teams and then only as a given man.\nAs with all cricketers in the first quarter of the 19th century, his full career details are uncertain but CricketArchive credits him with 73 known first-class appearances and 2,728 runs at a good average (for the time) of 23.51, with a highest score of 105.  In the field he is credited with 173 wickets, 51 catches and 27 stumpings.\n\nC. H. Wheeler recorded that he played cricket into his eighties and added that:...he was prepared to back himself against any man in England ... in five manly sports - cricket, shooting, running, jumping and sparring. Though his celebrity was more especially for the first of the five, I have heard him say, \"If there is one thing I can do better than another, it is the last-named.\"\nHis other interests included pig-keeping and tulip-growing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Lascelles", "response": ["Lascelles played first-class cricket in 1818.

In 1806, he had the idea of a match between the amateurs and the professionals. To emphasise the social distance between the two, the amateur team would be called the Gentlemen and the paid professionals the Players. Even then, it was not a straight match because Beauclerk selected the two leading professional players Billy Beldham and William Lambert as \"given men\" for the Gentlemen. Thanks mainly to Lambert's contribution, the Gentlemen won. The match was not a success but Beauclerk organised a repeat two weeks later, also at Lord's. This time, only Lambert was a given man and Beldham joined the Players. The joint efforts of Beauclerk and Lambert earned another win for the Gentlemen. The seed for the long-running series had been planted but the fixture was not revived until 1819. Cricket was badly disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars, especially between 1810 and 1814. The 1819 match was won by the Players, who had the unquestionably amateur Lord Strathavon as a \"given man\", against a Gentlemen team that was all-amateur and included their best players Beauclerk, E. H. Budd and William Ward. As in 1806, the game attracted little interest but MCC were determined to persevere.", "Like everything else, cricket struggled as the Napoleonic Wars wore on and very few matches were played when the conflict escalated from 1810 to 1814. MCC were accused by some critics of not providing leadership or vision but in fact MCC kept the game alive and maintained a profile. There was a discernible change in the type of membership as the war progressed. As the 1820s began, the aristocrats like Dorset, Winchilsea and Colonel Lennox had gone and MCC's leading lights then, besides Beauclerk, included E. H. Budd, a civil servant, and William Ward, a banker. Having been founded by \"noblemen and gentlemen\", MCC now belonged to the \"gentlemen\" and, as such, they were keen to maintain their \"declaration of social realities\" by matching teams of Gentlemen against teams of paid Players."]}, {"page": "The Cricketers of My Time", "response": ["| E.
