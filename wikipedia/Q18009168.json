During that time Bruno completed and published some of his most important works, the six \"Italian Dialogues\", including the cosmological tracts La cena de le ceneri (The Ash Wednesday Supper, 1584), De la causa, principio et uno (On Cause, Principle and Unity, 1584), De l'infinito, universo et mondi (On the Infinite, Universe and Worlds, 1584) as well as Lo spaccio de la bestia trionfante (The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast, 1584) and De gli eroici furori (On the Heroic Frenzies, 1585). Some of these were printed by John Charlewood. Some of the works that Bruno published in London, notably The Ash Wednesday Supper, appear to have given offense. Once again, Bruno's controversial views and tactless language lost him the support of his friends. John Bossy has advanced the theory that, while staying in the French Embassy in London, Bruno was also spying on Catholic conspirators, under the pseudonym \"Henry Fagot\", for Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth's Secretary of State."]}, {"page": "Carnival", "response": ["The word Carnival is of Christian origin, and in the Middle Ages, it referred to a period following Epiphany season that reached its climax before midnight on Shrove Tuesday. British historian John Bossy, in writing on the origin of the practices during Carnival, states that \"These were, despite some appearances, Christian in character, and they were medieval in origin: although it has been widely supposed that they continued some kind of pre-Christian cult, there is in fact no evidence that they existed much before 1200.\" Because Lent was a period of fasting, \"Carnival therefore represented a last period of feasting and celebration before the spiritual rigors of Lent.\" Meat was plentiful during this part of the Christian calendar and it was consumed during Carnival as people abstained from meat consumption during the following liturgical season, Lent. In the last few days of Carnival, known as Shrovetide, people confessed (shrived) their sins in preparation for Lent as well. In 1605, a Shrovetide play spoke of Christians who painted their faces to celebrate the season: "]}, {"page": "Francis Walsingham", "response": ["In May 1582, letters from the Spanish ambassador in England, Bernardino de Mendoza, to contacts in Scotland were found on a messenger by Sir John Forster, who forwarded them to Walsingham. The letters indicated a conspiracy among the Catholic powers to invade England and displace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots.Hutchinson, pp. 101\u2013103 By April 1583, Walsingham had a spy, identified as Giordano Bruno by historian John Bossy, deployed in the French embassy in London. Walsingham's contact reported that Francis Throckmorton, a nephew of Walsingham's old friend Nicholas Throckmorton, had visited the ambassador, Michel de Castelnau.Hutchinson, p. 104 In November 1583, after six months of surveillance, Walsingham had Throckmorton arrested and then tortured to secure a confessionHutchinson, pp. 73\u201374, 105; Wilson, pp. 173\u2013175\u2014an admission of guilt that clearly implicated Mendoza.Hutchinson, p. 106; Wilson, p. 175 The Throckmorton plot called for an invasion of England along with a domestic uprising to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, and depose Elizabeth.Cooper, pp. 158\u2013161; Hutchinson, pp. 105\u2013106 Throckmorton was executed in 1584 and Mendoza was expelled from England.Hutchinson, pp. 103\u2013104; Wilson, pp. 176\u2013177"]}, {"page": "Oxford History of England", "response": ["Many of the volumes are now considered to be key classic works for their respective periods. In recent years some of the volumes have been released as stand-alone works. A New Oxford History of England was commissioned in 1992 and has produced eleven volumes to date. At least six volumes are still forthcoming. John Bossy wrote in 1996 that the series \"does not much ring in the mind\" except for volumes 1, 2 and 15.
