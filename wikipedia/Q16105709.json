Page 103 Mersey Television made full use of their former technical college buildings in Childwall and writers introduced headmistress Barbara Harrison (Angela Morant), who moved into number 9 Brookside Close in December 1991 with her recently retired husband John (Geoffrey Leesley). Many scenes saw Barbara at Brookside Comprehensive (in reality derelict parts of Childwall Technical College), in charge of pupils such as teenagers Jacqui (Alexandra Fletcher) and Mike Dixon (Paul Byatt) from number 8, and Katie Rogers from number 5. The Harrisons' storylines included John's struggle with early retirement, his battle with asthma and his shoplifting sprees, and their son Peter (Robert Beck) became involved in a lengthy date-rape plot with Diana Corkhill. After a court case in which Peter was eventually found not guilty of rape, Rod left the Close and divorced Diana, believing her rape was really consensual, adulterous sex. The Harrisons also left the Close and were replaced by the Banks family, who arrived with much baggage of their own in January 1994."]}, {"page": "Richard Morant", "response": ["Morant was born in Shipston-on-Stour, Warwickshire.

It closely follows the plot of the book but has events occur over a few days rather than several months. Since the series placed the story after The Dead of Jericho, where Bell was promoted to superintendent, the character only appears briefly as Morse's superior rather than Morse taking over the case from him, with Morse instead involved from the start. Lionel's surname was changed to Pawlen and his brother became Simon. The postscript of Morse visiting Ruth after her release and them becoming lovers was replaced with him visiting her in her cell after sentencing and the device of Morse telling the press he was on the verge of making an arrest, prompting the attack on Ruth, was removed.
