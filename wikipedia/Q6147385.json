As a strongman, he won the 1989 World's Strongest Man, was World Muscle Power champion, and also had numerous other titles including Europe's Strongest Man and Britain's Strongest Man. Following retirement from competitive sport he continued to be involved in strength athletics as a referee, event promoter and coach.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World's Strongest Man", "response": ["After Kazmaier left, his nearest rival, former Olympian Geoff Capes from the UK, traded wins with the Icelandic powerlifter J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson, with Capes winning in 1983 and 1985, and Sigmarsson in 1984 and 1986. Sigmarsson raised the popularity and awareness of the event to new levels. He died three years after winning his 4th and final WSM in 1990. In 1987, Sigmarsson would defeat Capes and Kazmaier in Pure Strength. Kazmaier returned to WSM in 1988, but could not dethrone Sigmarsson, who won his 3rd title. The only other man to claim the title in this era was Jamie Reeves, which he did in 1989. Reeves was injured in 1990, as Sigmarsson narrowly claimed his 4th title ahead of O.D. Wilson, who was leading by 5.5 points going into the final event, a controversial 200m race with 100\u00a0kg on the back. Sigmarsson won the event, and the much larger Wilson finished way down the field, meaning Jon Pall became the first man to claim four titles.", "In 1995, Edmunds and Webster, along with representatives from the competitors including Jamie Reeves, Ilkka Kinnunen and Marcel Mostert formed a governing body called the International Federation of Strength Athletes (\"IFSA\"). The IFSA began organizing bespoke events, such as the IFSA European Championships and also took the lead in working with the BBC and with TWI to organize the World's Strongest Man competition. For almost a decade, the IFSA and WSM were inextricably mixed, but this changed in 2004. The InvestGroup Ventures' sports rights management arm, InvestGroup Sports Management, invested heavily into IFSA and this led to the creation of IFSA Strongman. The strategy was to acquire most of the international assets and properties relating to the strongman sport. In essence, this was a new organisation with some, such as Magnus Samuelsson, describing it as \"a new company ... with the same name as our old federation\". The attempt at dominance was not well received by TWI and disagreement ensued leading to a split in the sport. Previously, in 2001, the IFSA in its former guise had entered an agreement with World Class Events (WCE), headed by Ulf Bengtsson, to run the Super Series. This Super Series was designed to award the World Championship title, but also acted as a qualifying vehicle for the WSM. When strongman split in 2004, the Super Series sided with TWI forming a rival federation to the IFSA. With the WSM being a TWI owned event, IFSA Holdings announced its own World Championships for 2005, to be held in Quebec, and thus from that point had no involvement in the WSM contest.", "Magn\u00fas would also finish 2nd in both 1992 and 1993. The 1992 contest was won by Dutchman Ted van der Parre, who at 7 feet tall, is the tallest man ever to win or compete at the World's Strongest Man. In one of the closest contests in the competition's history, just 1 point separated Ted in 1st from Magn\u00fas and Jamie Reeves, who tied for 2nd. Conversely, in 1993, Welshman Gary Taylor became the shortest man to ever win the contest at just 6 feet tall, defeating Magn\u00fas and Riku Kiri of Finland.", "|1992 ||  Ted van der Parre ||  Magn\u00fas Ver Magn\u00fasson || Jamie Reeves || ", "||1989 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  Ab Wolders ||  J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson || ", "||1988 ||  J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson (3) ||  Bill Kazmaier ||  Jamie Reeves || ", "| 3 ||  Lars Hedlund Ab Wolders Jamie Reeves Riku Kiri Jouko Ahola Janne Virtanen Svend Karlsen"]}, {"page": "Strength athletics", "response": ["| Jamie Reeves", "| Jamie Reeves", "| Jamie Reeves"]}, {"page": "List of people from Yorkshire", "response": ["|Jamie Reeves"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Jamie Reeves, winner of World's Strongest Man"]}, {"page": "International Federation of Strength Athletes", "response": ["In 1995, David Webster, a Scotsman who later received an OBE for his services to sport and head coordinator of the World's Strongest Man from its inception, and his colleague Dr Douglas Edmunds, seven-times Scottish shot and discus champion and twice world caber champion,The Herald Scotland Bring on the war games DOUG GILLON, Athletics Correspondent, 19 May 2007 along with representatives from the competitors in strength athletics including Jamie Reeves, Ilkka Kinnunen and Marcel Mostert formed a governing body called the International Federation of Strength Athletes (\"IFSA\").

A new generation emerged, with the events attracting individuals from many disciplines such as field athletics, weightlifting and powerlifting. These competitions fed other international competitions such as Europe's Strongest Man and World's Strongest Man. Household names, such as Geoff Capes, Jamie Reeves and Gary Taylor dominated, with these three in particular going on to win World's Strongest Man titles. The modern era has seen this trend continue with Terry Hollands, Mark Felix and Laurence Shahlaei being regular faces at World's Strongest Man and its associated Super Series. Featured events in these contests have been tailored to emphasize a more well-rounded athlete, to reflect that viewpoint on strongman as a whole, and in the interests of increased popularity and marketability among the masses. Almost inevitably, more than one interested party has seen the benefits of strength competitions. Alternative organizations have formed in recent years, comprising a new wave of influence in the field, with the United Kingdom Strength Council (UKSC) founded by Britain's Strongest Man multi-year champion Glenn Ross setting up events separate from BSM, as has the IFSA. Ross and his UK Strongest Man competitions hold a philosophical difference in approach with the World's Strongest Man related venues, including more brute strength events similar to traditional strongman and powerlifting, with less emphasis on field athleticism and endurance.", "|  Jamie Reeves (4)", "|  Jamie Reeves (2)", "|  Jamie Reeves", "| Jamie Reeves", "| Gary TaylorJamie Reeves", "|  Jamie Reeves (2)", "| Jamie Reeves", "|  Jamie ReevesJohn Smith's Trial of Strength", "| Jamie Reeves", "|1992 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1990 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC", "|1987 ||  Geoff Capes ||  Jamie Reeves ||   Mark Higgins || Scotland", "|1997 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1996 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1995 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1994 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1993 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1992 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1989 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1988 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC", "|1987 ||  Jamie Reeves ||  TBC ||   TBC || TBC || TBC"]}, {"page": "List of British bodybuilders", "response": ["*Jamie Reeves"]}, {"page": "World Muscle Power Classic", "response": ["|2000 ||  / Jamie Reeves ||   Riku Kiri|| Paul Smeets || ", "|1992 ||  / Jamie Reeves ||   Magn\u00fas Ver Magn\u00fasson|| J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson || ", "|1991 ||  J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson || / Jamie Reeves ||   Magn\u00fas Ver Magn\u00fasson||", "|1989 ||   J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson || / Jamie Reeves ||  Ab Wolders  || "]}, {"page": "1992 World's Strongest Man", "response": ["The 1992 World's Strongest Man was the 15th edition of World's Strongest Man and was won by Ted van der Parre from the Netherlands after finishing fourth the previous year.
