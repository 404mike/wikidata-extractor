Valentine Baker, known as \"Baker Pasha\", was initially a British hero of the African Cape Colony, the Crimean War, Ceylon and the Balkans, later dishonoured by a civilian scandal. Valentine had successfully sought fame in the Ottoman Empire, notably the Russian-Turkish War in the Caucasus and the War of Sudan from Egypt. Samuel's other siblings were: James, John, Mary \"Min\" (later Cawston), Ellen (later Hopkinson) and Anna Eliza Baker (later Bourne).To The Heart of the Nile: Lady Florence Baker and the Exploration of Central Africa, by Pat Shipman", "Baker never received quite the same level of acclamation granted to other contemporary British explorers of Africa. Queen Victoria, in particular, avoided meeting Baker because of the irregular way in which he acquired Florence, not to mention the fact that during the years of their mutual travels, the couple were not actually married. A court case involving his brother Valentine Baker (following his indecent assault of a woman on a train) also harmed Baker's chances of wider acceptance by the Victorian establishment."]}, {"page": "Charles George Gordon", "response": ["Typical of the men that Khedive Isma'il Pasha hired was Valentine Baker, a British Army officer dishonorably discharged after being convicted of raping a young woman in England that he had been asked to chaperon.

Colonel Valentine Baker led an Egyptian force out of Suakin and was badly defeated by 1,000 Haddendowa warriors who declared their loyalty to the Mahdi under Osman Digna at Al-Teb with 2,225 Egyptian soldiers and 96 officers killed. Because the Egyptian troops at Suakin were repeatedly defeated, a British force was sent to Suakin under General Sir Gerald Graham, which drove the rebels away in several hard-fought actions. At Tamai on 13 March 1884, Graham was attacked by the Haddendowa (whom the British nicknamed \"Fuzzy Wuzzies\") whom he defeated, but in the course of the battle, the Haddendowa broke a Black Watch square, an action later celebrated in the Kipling poem \"Fuzzy-Wuzzy\".Perry, 2005 p. 179."]}, {"page": "Sadism and masochism in fiction", "response": ["*Raped on the Railway: a True Story of a Lady who was first ravished and then flagellated on the Scotch Express (1894), anonymous, by Charles Carrington  A married woman is raped by a stranger in a locked railway compartment and in a common trope in later Victorian pornography is depicted as ultimately taking pleasure in the act: she is then flagellated by her brother-in-law for the latter transgression.

An expedition by General Graham from Cairo won two victories at El-Teb (February 1884) and Tamai (March 1884).  Wolseley was called upon to rescue General Gordon from Khartoum.  But the loss of Suakin made it impossible to execute operations on the River Nile.  Wolseley took the radical step of forming a Camel Corps from the Household Cavalry regiments and The Royals totalling 200 hand-picked men.  He also picked a light Guards regiment as infantry.  They had left Aldershot via Southampton for Alexandria by 24 September, travelling down the Nile to Aswan, and thence by Camel they reached the big bend in the Nile by Christmas. The Blues were led by a renowned officer, Fred Burnaby.  At 6\u00a0ft tall, and 20 st he was very strong, a weightlifter.  Joined the Blues in 1859, paying \u00a31,250 for a Cornet's commission.

He was involved in the Carlist revolt of army officers in Spain.  He crossed the channel by balloon.  The Times reported on Gordon's plight, and Burnaby was their reporter in the Sudan.  He stood in Birmingham as a Conservative against Joseph Chamberlain.  Some officers complained that their extra marital affairs were being made public: but Burnaby was admired by the men in the regiment.  In 1884 Burnaby was wounded at El Teb.  But the public were dismayed to learn that he had fought in 'civvies' armed with a shot-gun.

Having crossed the Caspian Sea, they travelled to Ashgabat in Turkmenistan, from which they hoped to explore and survey the Atrak valley. This proved impossible at that time, so they headed towards Tehran in Persia (now Iran), crossing the Alborz mountains via a pass more than 2 miles above sea level. They skirted Mount Damavand, descended into the Mazandaran forests, recrossed the mountains to Damghan, then visited Mashhad. They then travelled to the fortress of Kilat-i-Nadir, which until then had been shown on British maps in two separate locations. Next, Baker and Gill trekked to Dargaz in the Kopet Dag Mountains. Dargaz was shown on the best British maps merely as a small town whereas in reality it was a large and thriving autonomous Kurdish district. Here William Gill was lucky to survive when he dropped his shotgun and it discharged at his feet. (His thick leather boots saved him.) Later, Baker and Gill succeeded in their original ambition of exploring the upper Atrak valley. This again revealed the poor quality of existing British maps of the region.
