Similarly, Christopher Priest, in his introduction to Anna Kavan's genre-defying but arguably slipstream novel Ice, writes \"the best way to understand slipstream is to think of it as a state of mind or a particular approach, one that is outside of all categorisation. ... slipstream induces a sense of 'otherness' in the audience, like a glimpse into a distorting mirror.\"Kavan, Anna.

The play is set in the late 1960s and reveals Davies' late literary recognition as well as Kavan's final tragedy.

However, \"There is a lot more going on in Saramago\u2019s prose, attitudes that would restore the menace to 'magical' and the grit to 'realism,'\" Fleming writes. A more immediate and obvious influence on Saramago is Fernando Pessoa whose work, like Saramago's, is \"ruminative\" and \"unearthly.\" In \"Embargo,\" Fleming sees automotive themes that echo the works of J.G.
