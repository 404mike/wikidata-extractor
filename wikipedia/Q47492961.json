The appointment is made by the council each year in May, at the same time appointing a sheriff, the city's other civic head. York's lord mayor is second only to the Lord Mayor of London in precedence. The office of mayor dates back to at least 1217 and was upgraded by Richard II to that of Lord Mayor in 1389.The Mansion House, York, is the Lord Mayor's home during his or her term of office.The use of the prefix \"right honourable\" appears to have been used since the creation of the lord mayoralty. It was confirmed by letters patent dated 1 April 1974, when York became a non-metropolitan district and reconfirmed by letters patent dated 1 April 1996, when it became a  unitary authority.\nIn 1212 King John granted York the right to collect its own taxes, hold courts and conduct its own affairs and thereby the right to elect a mayor. These rights were temporarily forfeited in 1280\u20131282 for altering a royal charter, in 1292\u20131297 for failing to pay taxes and in 1405\u20131406 for supporting Archbishop Richard Scrope. In 1389 King Richard II elevated the mayor to the status of lord mayor and supposedly gave his sword to be carried point upwards before him.", "link_mentions": []}}
