He was the son of artist Romilly Fedden and novelist Katherine Waldo Douglas.Raised mostly in Chantemesle, France, Fedden went to Cambridge University to read English. He served as a diplomat in Athens and taught English literature at Cairo University. He was one of the Cairo poets, and co-edited the literary journal Personal Landscape with Lawrence Durrell and Bernard Spencer. After World War II, he worked for the National Trust, rising to the post of Deputy Director-General. He retired in 1973.\nHe had a wide variety of interests, which were reflected in the books he wrote. The best known of these are The Enchanted Mountains and Chantemesle. He also wrote several guidebooks for the National Trust. He was a dedicated mountaineer, a pursuit he took up in his late thirties.\nHe was married to Renee Fedden; they had two daughters. He died in 1977.\nHenry Miller disliked Fedden. He recalled their meetings in Athens when he later wrote bitterly of expatriate Englishmen in The Colossus of Maroussi. Miller \"hated [Fedden's] stammer and his effete way of talking and ... framed a sharply satirical portrait of him in the Colossus,\" wrote Durrell in a letter in 1977.  But Durrell recognised that 'behind the slight stoop and stutter that were part of Fedden's disarming charm, there was a sharply critical mind interrogating the cultures of Europe and the East, and he looked up to him as he did to none of his other contemporaries' during the war years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chartwell", "response": ["In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became \"the most important country house in Europe\". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \"little Foreign Office\u00a0... the hub of resistance\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confidant of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\"."]}, {"page": "Terence Tiller", "response": ["Tiller was born in Truro, Cornwall and educated at Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith.Obituary, The Times, 5 January 1988, p 14 He studied history at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a starred first-class BA degree in 1937 and won the Chancellor's Medal for English Verse.'University News', Times, 21 June 1937, p. 20.

There had been a noticeable literary group in Cairo before the war in North Africa broke out, including university academics. Possibly as a reflection of that, there were two strands of literary activity and publication during the years 1942\u20131944. There was the Personal Landscape group centred on the publication of that name, founded by Lawrence Durrell, Robin Fedden and Bernard Spencer. There was also the Salamander group, which produced a magazine and the Oasis series of anthologies. To oversimplify, the first group produced poetic reputations, while the second, founded by servicemen, broadcast appeals and collected an archive of 17,000 poems written at the period.

The latter sought to explore the \"personal landscapes\" of writers experiencing exile during the war. The founders, like Manning, maintained a strong attachment to Greece rather than an artistic and intellectual engagement with Egypt. In remembering the departure from Greece, Manning wrote \"We faced the sea / Knowing until the day of our return we would be / Exiles from a country not our own.\" During their time in Egypt and Palestine, Manning and her husband maintained close links with refugee Greek writers, including translating and editing the work of George Seferis and Elie Papadimitriou. Manning described her impressions of the Cairo poetry scene in \"Poets in Exile\" in Cyril Connolly's magazine Horizon. She defended the writers from the claim of a London reviewer that they were \"out of touch\", suggesting that their work was strengthened by their access to other cultures, languages, and writers. Her review was much critiqued by those featured, including Durrell who objected to Spencer's poetry being praised at his expense."]}, {"page": "Penguin poetry anthologies", "response": ["Drummond Allison - Kenneth Allott - Patrick Anderson - W.

Joining Churchill's staff as a junior secretary in 1932, in 1940 she moved with the Churchills to Downing Street, becoming private secretary to Clementine Churchill. Appointed OBE in Churchill's resignation honours list in 1955, she became the first administrator when Chartwell was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1966. Hamblin, together with Lady Churchill and her daughter Mary Soames, were largely responsible for the organisation and arrangement of the house following Churchill's death. Robin Fedden, Deputy Director-General of the Trust and author of the first guidebook to Chartwell, recorded Hamblin's 33 years service to the Churchill family and to the house. Hamblin, famously discreet throughout her life, achieved some notoriety in 2015 when her leading role in the destruction of Graham Sutherland's portrait of Churchill was revealed. Presented to Churchill by the Houses of Lords and Commons as an 80th birthday present, the realistic portrait was detested by both Churchill and his wife and, acting on Lady Churchill's instructions, Hamblin and her brother removed the painting from Chartwell at some point in the mid-1950s and burnt it. Hamblin retired from the post of Administrator at Chartwell in 1973."]}, {"page": "Amy Nimr", "response": ["Her early paintings (pre-Art and Liberty) depicted aspects of life that were specific to Egypt while using traditional European techniques such as chiaroscuro. Many of her early painting consisted of portraits of Nubians, Bedouins from when she visited Upper Egypt and nude portraits of women from Nubia, Sudan, and Sub-Saharan Africa. She also painted still lifes, religious scenes and images of Egypt's Jewish community. Her style would take a turn in the mid-1940s when, in 1943, she suffered a traumatic experience. While at a picnic in the Saqqara desert with her husband and son Micky, her son was killed by a landmine. She took a break from painting but when she returned to it, her paintings consisted of corpses, skeletons, disfigured bodies. This was probably in response to the aftermath of World War II as well as the effects of British colonial violence in Egypt. In the mid-1940s, she exhibited these extremely dark and surrealist works at the Exposition de l'Art Ind\u00e9pendant which received great praise. In 1945, she wrote a literary critique on the Alexandria-born Greek poet, Constantine Cavafy for the surrealist war poetry journal titled Personal Landscape started up by the writer Lawrence Durrell and Robin Fedden, an English professor at Cairo University. She was the only Egyptian surrealist to contribute to the journal."]}]}}
