Colchester United manager Ted Davis signed him from Guildford for the newly formed Southern League club in the summer of 1937. Leslie made his debut for the U's in their first-ever professional match on 28 August 1937 as Colchester fell to a 3\u20130 defeat to Yeovil & Petters United at the Huish. Leslie suffered from a string of injury problems while with Colchester as he was required to undergo a cartilage operation in May 1938, and suffered further setbacks in October 1938, requiring further fitness training at Highbury, London. On his return to first-team action, Leslie was named club captain, having been voted as the best centre-half in the Southern League for the 1937\u201338 campaign. He was just behind Jack Hodge in becoming the first player for the club to reach 100 first-team appearances. Leslie ended his time with Colchester during the 1939\u201340 season, when the league was abandoned due to the onset of World War II. He made his final appearance in a 0\u20130 draw against Ipswich Town Reserves on 2 September 1939, bringing his total appearances to 102 in all competitions."]}]}}
