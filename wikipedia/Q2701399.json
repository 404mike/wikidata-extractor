One Nation Conservatives often invoke Edmund Burke and his emphasis on civil society (\"little platoons\") as the foundations of society, as well as his opposition to radical politics of all types. The Red Tory theory of Phillip Blond is a strand of the One Nation school of thought. Prominent Red Tories include former Cabinet Ministers Iain Duncan Smith and Eric Pickles and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State Jesse Norman.Politics Review, April 2013 There is a difference of opinion among supporters regarding the European Union. Some support it perhaps stemming from an extension of the cohesion principle to the international level, though others are strongly against the EU (such as Peter Tapsell)."]}, {"page": "Communitarianism", "response": ["* Phillip Blond"]}, {"page": "John Ruskin", "response": ["Ruskin was an inspiration for many Christian socialists, and his ideas informed the work of economists such as William Smart and J. A. Hobson, and the positivist Frederic Harrison.Gill Cockram, Ruskin and Social Reform: Ethics and Economics in the Victorian Age (Tauris, 2007)  Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the settlement movement in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at Toynbee Hall such as the future civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and William Beveridge (author of the Report ... on Social Insurance and Allied Services), and the future Prime Minister Clement Attlee acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British welfare state. More of the British Labour Party's earliest MPs acknowledged Ruskin's influence than mentioned Karl Marx or the Bible.Stuart Eagles, After Ruskin: The social and political legacies of a Victorian prophet, 1870\u20131920 (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Dinah Birch (ed.), Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern (Oxford University Press, 1999).

Phillip Blond promotes a radical communitarian traditionalist conservatism. It inveighs against welfare states as well as market monopolies and instead respects traditional values and institutions, localism, devolution of powers from the central governments to local communities, small businesses, and volunteerism. Blond also favours empowering social enterprises, charities and other elements of civil society to solve problems such as poverty.\"Rise of the Red Tories\", Prospect Magazine, February 2009 He has been mentioned as a major influence on the thinking of David Cameron and other Tories in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis. He advocates a civic state as the ideal, where the common good of society is valued and solutions emerge from local communities. Blond's ideas also parallel the socioeconomic tradition of distributism, as is evidenced by Blond's appearance at a distributist conference at Oxford University in 2009 sponsored by the G. K. Chesterton Institute for Faith and Culture. Blond's Red Toryism has been embraced by traditionalist conservatives in the United States, such as journalists Rod Dreher and economist John Medaille.", "The editors of the web log Front Porch Republic, however, define Red Toryism as a \"left or socialist conservatism\" and further go on to say that it is \"not a traditionalism that happened to oddly pick up a few egalitarian rhetorical tropes along the way.\" This is more in keeping with the typical dictionary definition of the term as: \"(Canadian) a Conservative who holds liberal or mildly socialist views on certain fiscal and social issues.\" In this regard, Phillip Blond's views are probably closer to what has been referred to as High Tory."]}, {"page": "Pensby High School", "response": ["*Phillip Blond, political philosopher, theologian and director of the ResPublica think tank"]}, {"page": "Traditionalist conservatism", "response": ["Burke, Coleridge, Carlyle, Newman, and other traditionalist conservatives' beliefs were distilled into former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's politics and ideology. When he was younger, Disraeli was an outspoken opponent of middle-class capitalism and the Manchester liberals' industrial policies (the Reform Bill and the Corn Laws). In order to ameliorate the suffering of the urban poor in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution, Disraeli proposed \"one-nation conservatism,\" in which a coalition of aristocrats and commoners would band together to counter the liberal middle class's influence. This new coalition would be a way to interact with disenfranchised people while also rooting them in old conservative principles. Disraeli's ideas (especially his critique of utilitarianism) were popularized in the \"Young England\" movement and in books like Vindication of the English Constitution (1835), The Radical Tory (1837), and his \"social novels,\" Coningsby (1844) and Sybil (1845).Viereck, pp. 42\u201345. His one-nation conservatism was revived a few years later in Lord Randolph Churchill's Tory democracy and in the early 21st century in British philosopher Phillip Blond's Red Tory thesis.", "Phillip Blond, a British philosopher, has recently gained notoriety as a proponent of traditionalist philosophy, specifically progressive conservatism, or Red Toryism.

He further opined that \"Just as we need the church to protect the political, so we need it to protect the idea of civil society.\" Blond concludes that the \"church establishment in England creates a more diverse political and social life, prevents religious extremism and helps to minimise partisan conflict and secular violence.\" Giles Coren, a British writer, supports antidisestablishmentarianism because it allows all English people  to receive meaningful rites such as marriage."]}, {"page": "List of Q+A panelists", "response": ["| Peter SingerPhillip BlondCassandra Goldie"]}, {"page": "Den 11. time", "response": ["Den 11. time included guests such as the then-Danish Minister of Culture, Brian Mikkelsen, but also had foreign guests such as Phillip Blond or even Mikhail Gorbachev, who stated in a letter to the presenters that it was one of the most interesting interviews he ever did.
