Townsend represented the Gentlemen on a number of occasions between 1874 and 1885.  He was a right-handed batsman (RHB) and an underarm right arm slow bowler who made 179 career appearances. Townsend scored 5,110 runs including two centuries with a highest score of 136.

They twice defeated Surrey by an innings margin but had less success against Nottinghamshire, drawing with them at Clifton College Close Ground and then losing by 10 wickets at Trent Bridge. The team had certain regulars but tended to include occasional and even guest players, some of whom weakened the side, whereas Nottinghamshire generally turned out a full-strength eleven. The key Gloucestershire players were the three Graces, batsman Thomas Matthews, wicket-keeper James Bush (who was also an England rugby union international), slow left-armer Robert Miles and all-rounders George Strachan and Frank Townsend. Newcomers in 1871 were Frederic Carter and George Wyatt who both made a number of appearances over the next few seasons."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Frank Townsend (1870\u20131892) : F.
