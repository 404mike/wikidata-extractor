With Tariq Anwar, he won the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for American Beauty (1999), which he was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film Editing. American Beauty is a serious drama, but in general Greenbury edited comedy films, including six directed by the Farrelly brothers commencing with 1994's Dumb and Dumber.\nGreenbury was a member of the American Cinema Editors (ACE).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "American Beauty (1999 film)", "response": ["American Beauty was edited by Christopher Greenbury and Tariq Anwar; Greenbury began in the position, but had to leave halfway through post-production because of a scheduling conflict with Me, Myself and Irene\u00a0(2000). Mendes and an assistant edited the film for ten days between the appointments. Mendes realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned. He believed he had been making a \"much more whimsical,\u00a0... kaleidoscopic\" film than what came together in the edit suite. Instead, Mendes was drawn to the emotion and darkness; he began to use the score and shots he had intended to discard to craft the film along these lines. In total, he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit. The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town. Mendes spent two days filming Spacey against bluescreen, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical\u2014\"like a Coen brothers movie\"\u2014and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set. The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father. This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester's death, as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane's request was not serious. However, in the portion he used in the opening\u2014and when the full scene plays out later\u2014Mendes used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt. The subsequent shot\u2014an aerial view of the neighborhood\u2014was originally intended as the plate shot for the bluescreen effects in the dream sequence."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Film Editing", "response": ["| Tariq Anwar and Christopher Greenbury"]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| The Heavenly Kid || Orion Pictures Corporation || Cary Medoway (director/screenplay); Martin Copeland (screenplay); Lewis Smith, Jason Gedrick, Jane Kaczmarek, Richard Mulligan, Mark Metcalf, Nancy Valen, Lynne Griffin, Christopher Greenbury || Romance, Comedy, Fantasy || Live action "]}, {"page": "2007 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4 || Christopher Greenbury || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 55 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film Editor || "]}, {"page": "72nd Academy Awards", "response": ["** American Beauty\u00a0\u2013 Tariq Anwar and Christopher Greenbury"]}, {"page": "Online Film Critics Society Awards 1999", "response": ["*American Beauty \u2013 Tariq Anwar and Christopher Greenbury"]}, {"page": "53rd British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["American Beauty \u2013 Tariq Anwar and Christopher Greenbury"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2007", "response": ["*Christopher Greenbury, 55, American film editor (American Beauty, There's Something About Mary, Daddy Day Care)."]}]}}
