He was an all-rounder, a right-handed batsman and right-arm bowler, able to bowl fast-medium outswing with the new ball and then brisk offspin.\nIn a long first-class career that lasted from 1906 to 1930, he took 2054 wickets at an average of 25.02, with best innings figures of 9/131. Newman took ten or more wickets in a match on 35 occasions. In 1927 he took 16 wickets for 88 runs against Somerset. Only two players taking more wickets in a career were never capped by England. For a number of years he and Alec Kennedy carried the Hampshire attack with little support, on two occasions bowling unchanged through both innings of a match.\nHe scored 15,364 runs at 21.57, with ten centuries of which the highest was 166 not out. He also held 318 catches.\nHe completed the 'double' of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in a season five times between 1921 and 1928. In 1921 he was the first that season to do so. His best all-round performance in a match was in 1926 against Gloucestershire; he scored 66 and 42 not out and took 14 wickets for 148 runs.\nJohn Arlott included him in a side of the best players who were never selected by England to play in a Test match.In 1922 Newman was involved in an incident at Trent Bridge, refusing to bowl while the crowd were barracking. His captain, the Hon. L. H. Tennyson ordered him from the field.\nAt the close of play Tennyson summoned Newman into the amateurs' changing-room. \"Jack,\" he said, \"you have this afternoon disgraced the annals of Hampshire cricket ... Hampshire cricket, mind you, the cradle of the game. You must send a letter of apology. Sit down; here's pen and paper. I'll dictate the letter.\"\nTennyson proceeded to speak out loud a letter to the president of Nottinghamshire in which Newman, who copied his captain's words down without a murmur, offered his profound apologies. A second letter, to Carr, the Nottinghamshire captain, followed.\nTennyson was not quite finished. \"Now, Jack, a final letter. To the Hon. L H Tennyson, captain, Hampshire County CC, Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire. `Dear Skipper, I humbly regret my behaviour, and so on,' you confounded old villain; and don't let us have a repetition of your disgraceful conduct. And, good evening to you, Jack, and, damn you, take this.\" He thrust a five pound note \u2013 a considerable sum in those days \u2013 into Newman's hands.\nHe stood as a first-class umpire for nine seasons. Subsequently he emigrated to Cape Town, where he coached for a number of years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Arlott", "response": ["He was also invited in 1981 to select his Best XI from players who, for a wide variety of reasons, were never capped by England.

The club finished last or equal last in 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, failing to win a single game in the first of those seasons; however in 1901, with the temporary acquisition of Captain Greig from India and the qualification of Charlie Llewellyn, Hampshire won as many games as it lost. From 1906 onwards, with the qualification of Phil Mead, Jack Newman and later George Brown, Hampshire became a much more competitive side, though not until 1910 did they win as many games as they lost in a season."]}, {"page": "1922 English cricket season", "response": ["Warwickshire and Hampshire took part in one of the most remarkable of all County Championship matches, at Edgbaston on 14\u201316 June.

The emergence of Alec Kennedy and Jack Newman during this period under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson led to stronger Hampshire performances, with Hampshire winning all three matches played at the ground in the 1921 season.  The Combined Services played only their second ever first-class match in that same season against the Australians.  Later in the 1920s, the Royal Navy played first-class cricket at the ground for the first time, against the 1927 touring New Zealanders. The first hat trick at the ground was taken by Stuart Boyes in 1925. Hampshire continued to play at the ground throughout the thirties, at a time when following the retirements of George Brown, Phil Mead, Jack Newman and Lord Tennyson Hampshire were a less successful team.  Hampshire played four matches per season there during the thirties, with the exception of 1938 when they played five matches, before returning to four in 1939. Hampshire record partnership for the fifth wicket was made there in 1937, when Gerry Hill and Donald Walker put on 235, a record which stands to this day.
