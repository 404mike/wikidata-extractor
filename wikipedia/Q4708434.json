He became a farmer, and was active in the National Farmers Union, being President of the East Ross branch for two years. He was elected to Ross-shire County Council in 1935 on which he served for twenty years; on leaving the council he was a member of the Crofters' Commission for five years.\nAt the 1964 general election Mackenzie was elected, at the age of 61 and contesting his first parliamentary election, as a Liberal for Ross and Cromarty. He defeated the sitting National Liberal obtaining a majority of 1407 votes. Initially he was denied admission to the House of Commons as he couldn't speak English and thus couldn't take the Oath of Allegiance. After Jeremy Thorpe arranged for Mackenzie to undergo quick lessons in English so he would be able to take the Oath of Allegiance. His prior lack of knowledge of English would lead to his speeches in the House of Commons being quite short and generally incomprehensible. He was re-elected in 1966 but defeated at the 1970 general election. Mackenzie had been party spokesman in the Commons on Agriculture and Fisheries and posts and telecommunications. He  differed from the majority of his party in opposing United Kingdom membership of the European Economic Community. He was the lone Liberal voting against the Labour government at the end of debate on the Common Market. He was also out of step with the mainstream party on the issue of capital punishment. He was a principal supporter of the campaign to re-instate the death penalty for the murder of police or prison officers led by Conservative MP, Duncan Sandys in 1966 In 1970 he was appointed to the Scottish Agricultural Advisory Committee but died later that year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*Alasdair Mackenzie (Ross and Cromarty)"]}, {"page": "Alasdair", "response": ["*Alasdair Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "Ross and Cromarty (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alasdair Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alasdair Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alasdair Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Alasdair Mackenzie, farmer and Liberal MP 1964\u201370."]}, {"page": "1967 Liberal Party leadership election", "response": ["Although the vote was by a secret ballot, Liberal MP Peter Bessell later published a memoir in which he asserted that Jo Grimond, John Pardoe, David Steel, James Davidson and himself all voted for Thorpe; Alasdair Mackenzie and Russell Johnston voted for Hooson; and Michael Winstanley and Richard Wainwright voted for Lubbock.

He was however defeated at the 1964 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Alasdair Mackenzie, and then left politics. He returned to the tweed looms of Portree where he designed many new patterns which he continued to sell across the world.

The party gained a partial revival in the 1964 general election returning three further MPs; George Mackie, Russell Johnston and Alasdair Mackenzie. A further gain came the following year with David Steel's victory at the Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles by-election.
