Being aware of the treacherous nature of the Irish Sea, with many ships being wrecked around the Manx coast, he drew up plans for a national lifeboat service manned by trained crews. Initially he received little response from the Admiralty. However, on appealing to the more philanthropic members of London society, the plans were adopted and, with the help of Member of Parliament Thomas Wilson and former MP and merchant George Hibbert, the Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck was founded at a very well-attended public meeting at the London Tavern on 4 March 1824, presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Manners-Sutton. The Institution gained the patronage of King George IV, and not long afterwards the granting of the Royal prefix,Note: It's not clear from sources if the Royal prefix was part of the name from the beginning. making it Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck.
