The list is by season, this being the season in which the player's name first appears in surviving sources.\nCricket underwent radical changes during the 18th century. Patronage and popular support enabled it to outgrow its roots as a village pastime and develop into a major sport. In the early 1760s, pitched delivery bowling was introduced and this necessitated the invention of the straight bat: an evolution in bowling and batting techniques that radically changed cricket.\nThe earliest known scorecards date from 1744 but it was not until 1772 that they began to be completed and are preserved on a regular basis.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William King", "response": ["William King may refer to:", "*William King (author) (born 1959), British science fiction author and game designer, also known as Bill King", "*William King (artist) (1925\u20132015), American sculptor", "*William King (poet) (1663\u20131712), English poet", "*William King (singer) (born 1949), American singer with the Commodores", "*William King (Canadian politician) (1930\u20132020), British Columbia politician", "*William King (governor) (1768\u20131852), American statesman, governor of Maine", "**William King (Simmons), an 1878 marble sculpture", "*William King (Governor of West Florida) (died 1826), American governor of West Florida, 1818\u20131819", "*William King (Australian politician) (1893\u20131966), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*William King (bishop) (1650\u20131729), Anglican Archbishop of Dublin", "*William King (minister) (1812\u20131895), Canadian Presbyterian minister and community founder", "*William King (priest) (died 1590), Canon of Windsor", "*William King (physician) (1786\u20131865), British physician, supporter of cooperative movement", "*William King (engineer) (1851\u20131929), Scottish engineer", "*William King (geologist) (1809\u20131886), Irish geologist, first to recognize Homo neanderthalensis as a species", "*William King (GSI) (died 1900), geologist with the Geological Survey of India", "*William King (London cricketer), English cricketer of the 1750s", "*William King (footballer) (1898\u20131962), Scottish international footballer", "*William King (rugby union) (1890\u20131937), American rugby union player", "*Dolly King (William King, 1916\u20131969), American baseball player", "*William King (police officer) (born 1972), former Baltimore police officer sentenced to 315 years in prison", "*William King (St Mary Hall) (1685\u20131763), English Jacobite academic and writer ", "*William King, 1st Earl of Lovelace (1805\u20131893), 8th Baron King and 1st Earl of Lovelace", "*William King (merchant) (c. 1785\u20131861), West Indies merchant and slave owner"]}, {"page": "London Cricket Club", "response": ["* 1753 \u2013 William King"]}]}}
