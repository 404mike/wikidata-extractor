The 60-minute show was recorded at Glasgow's OVO Hydro during the afternoon prior to broadcast. It was presented by Scottish journalist James Cook before an audience of about 7,500 16- and 17-year-olds, first-time voters on the day of the referendum, some of whom were invited to quiz a panel of prominent politicians from both the \"Yes\" and \"No\" campaigns.", "The debate was recorded at OVO Hydro on the afternoon of Thursday 11 September 2014, and broadcast during the evening on BBC One (earlier in Scotland). Presented by James Cook, the four members of the panel were Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Green Party leader Patrick Harvie for the Yes campaign, and Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson and Respect Party politician George Galloway for the No campaign. The audience was made up of 7,500 teenagers representing every secondary school in Scotland.", "Julie McDowall of The Herald writes that the debate started off slowly, but came to life after twelve minutes when Galloway was asked a question about employment, but chose instead to speak about fiscal matters. Galloway was booed on several occasions. Much of the debate focused on topics relating to taxation, oil reserves, banking, poverty and how to protect NHS Scotland, over which there were some heated exchanges. McDowall also notes that some \"comical directions from the stage\" were required because of the venue's size. \"James Cook had to call for questions from 'the man clapping with your hands in the air' or 'the boy pointing at your own head!'\". Writing for The Times about the event 18 months later, Matt Chorley reflected that \"The sight of\" Galloway, \"in his large black fedora telling the audience to ask their grandparents about the Nazis became one of the most memorable things about the evening\".
