She serves as both the love interest to Paul and the voice of opposition to the death penalty.Talbot (2006), p. 31-58 She was already offered a role in the film's predecessor, Death Wish (1974) but, Charles Bronson refused because he didn't want his wife humiliated and messed around with by the actors who played muggers. After she was hired for this film, Bronson wanted her character not to get raped or killed by the villains of the film. Cannon initially asked Golan to direct the film, but Bronson insisted on instead recruiting Michael Winner, the director of the original. Winner had suffered a downturn in his career since the mid-1970s, with no box-office hit since Death Wish. He agreed to return to the franchise and also took the initiative in revising Engelbach's script.Talbot (2006), p. 31-58 Winner recalled that De Laurentiis was having second thoughts about letting someone else produce the sequel and offered to hire him to do the film for his own production company. Winner refused, and De Laurentiis did not renege on his deal with Cannon. The producer, however, started work on a \"clone\" of the film. The final result was Fighting Back (1982).Talbot (2006), p. 31-58 Winner said the sequel was pertinent because \"mugging is now a bigger issue in America. It's spread to towns where it was not a problem before. In Beverly Hills, instead of talking about other people's failed movies \u2013 thank God, something has stopped them at last \u2013 they talk about their muggings.\" The film introduced significant changes for the character of Paul. One involved his modus operandi as a vigilante. In the original film, Paul would shoot and kill every criminal in his vicinity. In the sequel, he is after five specific criminals who are responsible for the death of his daughter. His single-minded pursuit extends to ignoring other potential targets. He is seen to ignore most thieves, drug dealers, and one violent pimp.Talbot (2006), p. 31-58 Another change involves his abilities. In the first film, his activities as a vigilante rely only on his use of weapons. In the sequel, he is able to beat up men who are considerably younger than himself.Talbot (2006), p. 31-58 While casting the actors for the roles of the villains, Winner gave the actors playing the thugs a lot of creative leeway. They bought their own costumes, designed their own makeup and tested them out on passers-by to see how intimidating they'd look. Laurence Fishburne bought a pair of magician's gloves and waved his knife like a wand, while Kevyn Major Howard waxed his eyebrows and shaved the front of his head to make himself look like a snake.

Roger Ebert gave it zero stars, noting that he reserves this rating solely for those very few films that are both \"artistically inept and morally repugnant.\" Citing the lethargic tone of the acting and directing, the lack of plot, the lifeless dialogue, and the weak action sequences, he concluded, \"while the first film convinced me of Bronson's need for vengeance, this one is just a series of dumb killings.\" Variety called it \"every bit as revolting as... the original\"."]}, {"page": "Tracy Nelson (actress)", "response": ["Nelson is active in cancer research advocacy and was the spokesperson for The Lymphoma Research Foundation of America.

The role was played by Sandy Grizzle, the then-lover of the director. She would subsequently report of this relationship in the tabloids Daily Star and News of the World. She claimed that Winner whipped her and used her as a sex slave. Although Jimmy Page is credited as composer, he had no involvement with the movie. Michael Winner reused Page's score for Death Wish II in the editing stage, and rearranged the music for the actual soundtrack, which included Mike Moran (credited as \"arranger and conductor\") on synthesizers. When it came to the casting of muggers, the production crew hired multiple locals from London. Gavan O'Herlihy got the role as the main villain of the film, Manny Fraker.

After numerous failed takes, Michael Winner asked him jokingly, \"I thought you wanted to do your own stunts?\". Kirk Taylor who played \"The Giggler\" told a story that Winner didn't like Taylor's tardiness one day. However, Winner quickly dismissed that and called the popular horror director, Stanley Kubrick who was in London to look for actors for his upcoming film, Full Metal Jacket (1987). Winner put a good word on Taylor and he got to play in the film. Paul Kersey's love interest in the film, Kathryn Davis was played by Deborah Raffin.
