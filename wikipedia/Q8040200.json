The dispersal of these collections began in 1863 with the Bicknell Gallery, and continued at irregular intervals for many years, e.g. Joseph Gillott (1872), Sam Mendel (1875), Wynne Ellis and Albert Levy (1876), Albert Grant (1877) and Munro of Novar (1878)."]}, {"page": "Mercery", "response": ["* Wynne Ellis, 19th-century British mercer"]}, {"page": "Leicester (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Wynne Ellis", "| Wynne Ellis"]}, {"page": "Cadogan Place", "response": ["*No. 30 was the residence of Wynne Ellis, haberdasher and art collector and benefactor to the National Gallery."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|Wynne Ellis"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1831 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Leicester(two members)||Wynne Ellis||Whig"]}, {"page": "Portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire", "response": ["Gainsborough's painting of her around 1785, in a large black hat (a style which she made fashionable, and came to be known as the 'Gainsborough' or 'portrait' hat), has become famous for its history.

In 1841 she sold it to a picture dealer for \u00a356, and he later gave it to a friend, the art collector Wynne Ellis. When Ellis died, the painting went for sale at Christie's in London in 1876, where it was bought by the Bond Street art dealer William Agnew for the then astronomical sum of 10,000 guineas, at the time the highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. Three weeks later it was stolen from the London gallery of Thomas Agnew & Sons, a theft that was highly publicised at the time, and for years the newspapers printed stories about claimed sightings of the painting.The Sydney Mail 13 October 1877: Gainsborough's \"Duchess of Devonshire\" Retrieved 2012-01-29Number One London 26 May 2010: Duchess of Devonshire Stolen Retrieved 29 July 2012"]}, {"page": "Wynne (given name)", "response": ["*Wynne Ellis (1790\u20131875), wealthy British haberdasher, politician and art collector"]}, {"page": "Jill Allibone", "response": ["While visiting her grandmother's grave at All Saints Church in Whitstable, Kent, Allibone chanced upon a mausoleum designed by Charles Barry junior in 1875, for Wynne Ellis, a wealthy haberdasher and donor to the National Gallery.
