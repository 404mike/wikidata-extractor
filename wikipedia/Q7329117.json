He was a regular in the Wales 22 but only gained one Wales cap as he was being overlooked for Robert Howley and Rupert Moon. He is well known for using the box kick to relieve the pressure posed by the opposition and to also gain territory.  He was a very skilful, technical and intelligent rugby player with excellent game management.\nWhen he joined Cardiff RFC former coach Dai Young said\n\nRichard is a man for all seasons and all conditions, equally good whatever type of game we try to play - I am absolutely delighted that he is joining us.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Smith", "response": ["Richard Smith may refer to:", "* Richard Smith (silent film director) (1886\u20131937), American silent film director", "* Richard Smith (screenwriter), Scottish screenwriter, film director, BAFTA-winning writer of Trauma", "* Richard Smith (artist) (1931\u20132016), English painter", "* Richard Smith (American guitarist), jazz guitarist in California", "* Richard Smith (English guitarist) (born 1971), English-born fingerstyle guitarist in Nashville, Tennessee", "* Richard Smith (editor), British medical doctor, former editor of the British Medical Journal", "* Richard Smith (soldier) ( - 1819), Canadian soldier and magistrate", "* Richard Smith (East India Company officer) (1734\u20131803), Commander-in-Chief, India", "* Richard Smith (MP for Arundel), Member of Parliament (MP) for Arundel", "* Richard Smith (MP for Devizes), MP for Devizes, 1402", "* Richard Smith (died 1516), MP for Reading", "* Richard Smith (died 1581), MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme", "* Richard Smith (fl. 1584), MP for Cricklade", "* Richard Smith (Canadian politician) (1931\u20131978), former Liberal MPP for Nipissing, Ontario", "* Richard Smith (Continental Congress) (1735\u20131803), lawyer and New Jersey delegate to the Continental Congress", "* Richard Smith (diplomat) (1934\u20132015), Australian diplomat, Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom", "* Richard Smith (mining engineer) (1783\u20131868), English-born mining engineer and politician in Nova Scotia", "* Richard Smith (historical geographer) (born 1946), British academic, historical geographer and demographer", "* Richard Smith (rugby union, born 1973) (born 1973), former Wales international rugby union player", "* Richard Smith (rugby league) (born 1973), rugby league player", "* Richard Smith (footballer, born 1967), English footballer for Mansfield Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers", "* Richard Smith (footballer, born 1970), English footballer for Leicester City, Cambridge United and Grimsby Town", "* Richard Smith (wide receiver) (born 1980), American football player", "* Richard Smith (American football coach) (born 1955), former defensive coordinator for the NFL's Houston Texans", "* Richard Smith (field hockey) (born 1987), British field hockey player", "* Richard Smith (rugby union, born 1987), Cardiff Blues Centre", "* Richard Smith (umpire) (born 1972), Irish cricket umpire", "* Richard Smith (Costa Rican footballer) (born 1967), former footballer with Alajuelense, Antigua and Carmelita", "* Richard Smith (sport shooter) (born 1950), American sports shooter", "* Richard Smith (Barbadian cricketer) (1873-1954), Barbadian cricketer", "* Richard Smith (Trinidadian cricketer) (born 1971), Trinidadian cricketer", "* Richard Smith (South African cricketer) (born 1972), South African cricketer", "* Richard Smith (businessman) (1836\u20131919) managing director of Australian company Harris Scarfe", "* Richard Smith (merchant) (1707\u20131776), English merchant in the West Indies trade", "* Richard Smith (settler) (1596\u20131666), one of earliest settlers of Rhode Island", "* Richard Smith (bishop) (1568\u20131655), English Catholic Bishop, titular of Chalcedon in Asia Minor"]}, {"page": "Ebbw Vale RFC", "response": ["| ||Richard Smith ||1 International"]}, {"page": "2000 Six Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Richard Smith"]}]}}
