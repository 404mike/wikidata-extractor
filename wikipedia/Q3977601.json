In 2004, the last year of his show, his listeners voted Distance, Digital Mystikz, and Plastician in their top 50 for the year. Dubstep started to enter mainstream British popular culture when it spread beyond small local scenes in late 2005 and early 2006; many websites devoted to the genre appeared on the Internet and aided the growth of the scene, such as dubstepforum, the download site Barefiles and blogs such as gutterbreakz. Simultaneously, the genre was receiving extensive coverage in music magazines such as The Wire and online publications such as Pitchfork, with a regular feature entitled The Month In: Grime/Dubstep. Interest in dubstep grew significantly after BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs started championing the genre, beginning with a show devoted to it (entitled \"Dubstep Warz\") in January 2006."]}, {"page": "Distance (disambiguation)", "response": ["Distance is a numerical description of how far apart objects are.", "Distance may also refer to:", "* Distance function, defines a distance between each pair of elements of a set", "* Distance (graph theory), the distance between two vertices in a graph", "*Distance (band), a late-1980s rock supergroup featuring Bernard Edwards and Tony Thompson", "*Distance (musician), British music producer and DJ, influential on the dubstep genre", "*Distance (Antagonist EP), 2007", "*Distance (Battery album), 1996", "*Distance (Dan Michaelson and The Coastguards album), 2014", "*Distance (Hikaru Utada album), 2001", "*\"Distance\" (SS501 song), 2007", "*\"Distance\" (F.T.
