He has been a Labor member of the South Australian House of Assembly since the 2014 state election, representing Napier until 2018 and Taylor thereafter.Before his election, Gee had been a secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union vehicle division and a Labor state president with close connections to the northern suburbs of Adelaide and to Holden.Gee's seat of Napier was renamed King and the boundaries moved east for the 2018 election, paring Gee's margin from a fairly safe nine percent to an extremely marginal 0.1 percent. Gee opted to transfer to the friendlier seat of Taylor, which received some of the western part of Napier in the redistribution.Gee announced in late January 2021 that he no longer intended to contest the 2022 South Australian state election. It was rumoured that federal MP Nick Champion would take his place as Champion's previous plan to move to the electoral  district of Light fell through.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Electoral district of Napier", "response": ["Napier ceased to exist at the 2018 state election. because of a redistribution in 2016.
