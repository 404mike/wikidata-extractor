He is the father of the footballer Clifford Leeming, born 1920 who went on to play for various clubs including Bolton Wanderers Bury and Tranmere Rovers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bury F.C.", "response": ["Six of Bury's 1900 finalists were in the 1903 team, led by skipper George Ross who scored the opening goal after 20 minutes. Derby's keeper Jack Fryer played despite an existing injury which he aggravated early in the second half when he was trying to prevent Charlie Sagar from scoring Bury's second goal. As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. Joe Leeming scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and Jack Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty. Bury's 6\u20130 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin. Bury remained sole holders of the record until the 2019 final in which Manchester City defeated Watford by the same score. The ball used in the 1903 final is on display at the National Football Museum."]}, {"page": "1900 FA Cup Final", "response": ["In its match report next day, The Observer says Bury began attacking immediately and The Times ascribes their eventual success to the method of the half-backs (Pray, Joe Leeming and George Ross) in feeding their own forwards and killing the Southampton game. From the start, the Bury forwards directed high crosses into the goalmouth to test the Southampton goalkeeper, Jack Robinson. Although Southampton kept things even at first, their first mistake was by Peter Durber who allowed Richards to force a corner. This was taken by Plant whose cross was converted by McLuckie into the first goal, scored after nine minutes of play. The Observer says that, although Southampton tried hard to make amends, they failed against \"a clever and determined defence\".", "|CH || Joe Leeming"]}, {"page": "1903 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The final was watched by a crowd of 63,102 and Bury, leading 1\u20130 at half-time, won a one-sided match 6\u20130 with goals by Joe Leeming (2), George Ross, Charlie Sagar, Willie Wood and Jack Plant. Bury's six-goal victory remains the record winning margin in FA Cup finals, though it was equalled in the 2019 final when Manchester City defeated Watford by the same score. Bury were the second team to score six in a final, following Blackburn Rovers in the 1890 final; and also the second team to win the cup without conceding a goal in the entire competition, following Preston North End in the 1888\u201389 tournament.", "Derby arrived at the ground with worries about the fitness of Bloomer and Fryer. Bloomer declared himself unfit but Fryer refused to stand aside for his understudy, Frank Davies, who had never played at senior level. Despite their problems, Derby began the match as favourites given their league form to the end of March, although they were now out of title contention. Bury had no team problems and could field their full first-choice eleven, including six players who had won the cup three years earlier: Joe Leeming, Plant, Richards, George Ross, Sagar and Willie Wood.", "Bury began the second half in complete control and Derby's play was so poor that Bury were never fully extended. Monteith had very little to do while, at the other end, it was soon clear that Fryer should not have been playing at all. He aggravated his injury when he tried to prevent Charlie Sagar scoring the second Bury goal three minutes after the interval. The two players had collided and Fryer was forced to leave the field for treatment. With no substitutes allowed, Derby were down to ten men. Left back Charlie Morris deputised for Fryer but, after 56 minutes, Joe Leeming chipped the ball over him as he raced out of his goal and that gave Bury a 3\u20130 lead.", "|IL || Joe Leeming"]}, {"page": "1902\u201303 FA Cup", "response": ["The Final was contested by Bury and Derby County at Crystal Palace.
