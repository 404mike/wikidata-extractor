He played for a number of amateur sides as a youth but began his professional career with Clyde in the Scottish Football League. He signed for Football League First Division side Cardiff City in 1925 for a fee of \u00a32,000. He made more than 150 appearances for the side over four seasons in all competitions and was part of the team that won the 1927 FA Cup Final.\nIn 1929, he was sold to Manchester United where he was later appointed club captain. He later played for Chester in 1933 before being appointed manager of French side Le Havre in 1934, where he also briefly played. He returned to Scotland in 1935, becoming manager of Queen of the South. He spent two seasons in charge of the side and also led the team on a 1936 overseas tour of France. He left the club in March 1937 and took up employment as a draughtsman before emigrating to the United States.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sam English", "response": ["In 1935 the recently appointed Queen of the South manager George McLachlan took English back north to Scotland for a spell at the Dumfries based club. The move was not a success and English was given a free transfer to Hartlepool United in July 1936. He was to find that his reputation had preceded him, he often faced taunts regarding the death of Thomson, and he never fully recovered his playing form although managed 31 goals in 75 appearances for the north-east of England team. Eventually he gave up football at the age of 28, and was quoted afterwards as describing his playing career after the Thomson accident as being \"seven years of joyless sport.\""]}, {"page": "List of Manchester United F.C. players", "response": ["|scope=\"row\"| George McLachlan"]}, {"page": "Palmerston Park", "response": ["Modern attendances are small in comparison with Queens' heyday in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.

After a goalless first half, Cardiff scored twice via a header by Len Davies and a shot by Ernie Curtis. Aston Villa managed to reply just once, when Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Farquharson scored an own goal after turning in a shot by Villa forward Arthur Dorrell. In the fourth round, Cardiff were drawn against Football League Second Division side Darlington. Newspaper reports indicated that Cardiff were the better team, and had it not been for the success of Darlington's defence they would have won by a greater margin. The goals were scored by George McLachlan and Hughie Ferguson.", "| || George McLachlan"]}, {"page": "Hughie Ferguson", "response": ["In November 1925, officials from Welsh side Cardiff City submitted an offer for Ferguson. Their bid was rejected but they returned to meet Motherwell's asking price soon after; Ferguson signed for a fee of \u00a35,000, just \u00a31,000 less than the record transfer fee at the time. Such was his popularity at the Scottish club that the local steelworks closed for half an hour as the workers lined the streets to wave Ferguson off. A large crowd also gathered at the train station as he departed and a salute of 21 fog signals was issued from the David Colville & Sons works as he passed. Cardiff manager Fred Stewart, who was accompanying him, remarked that \"he had never seen a player given such a send-off before\". Ferguson was one of three Scots signed by Cardiff in short succession with Joe Cassidy and George McLachlan both arriving for a similar \u00a35,000 fee combined. Ferguson made a goalscoring debut for the club on 7 November 1925 in a 5\u20132 win over Leicester City, a match in which Cassidy scored a hat-trick.
