He achieved this while playing for Kent County Cricket Club against an England XI at Lord's in 1848.Hinkly was born at Benenden in Kent in 1817. He made his first-class cricket debut for Kent against Surrey at The Oval in 1846, going on to play in 43 known first-class matches between then and 1858. He was a professional player for Northumberland in 1862 and, as well as playing for them and Kent, played two matches for Surrey and appeared four times for England in matches against counties, twice for South of England and once for \"Surrey Club\". He stood as an umpire for the Surrey v Kent match at The Oval in 1852. He played for a number of clubs in different parts of the country as a professional.The most notable incident of his career was taking all ten wickets in an innings for Kent in 1848, the first time that the feat of taking all ten wickets had been recorded. His exact bowling analysis is unknown as runs conceded were not recorded.He died at Walworth, London in 1880 aged 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lord's", "response": ["*Three bowlers have taken a ten-wicket haul in an innings where the exact bowling figures are not recorded, however it is known they conceded less than 20 runs, they are William Lillywhite, Edmund Hinkly and John Wisden.

The first to do so was Edmund Hinkly in 1848 for Kent v England at Lord's.England won the toss and batted first, scoring 120 (Edmund Hinkly took six wickets).  Kent replied with 90 (John Wisden took seven wickets).  In their second innings England made 74 (Hinkly took all ten wickets) and they then dismissed Kent for 49 (Wisden took five wickets).  England won by 55 runs. Scorecard  Perhaps the most famous early instance was two years later, when John Wisden, playing for the North of England v South of England at Lord's in 1850, clean bowled all ten South batsmen.South of England batted first and scored 36 (William Clarke took six wickets), and North of England replied with 131 (Thomas Sherman took six wickets).  In their second innings South of England made 76, all ten batsmen were out bowled Wisden.  North of England won by an innings and 19 runs.  Scorecard  In these early matches, the number of runs scored off each bowler was not recorded.  The only other all-ten analysis not to contain any direct assistance from a fielder was by Eric Hollies, who got seven Nottinghamshire batsman out clean bowled and three leg before wicket in his ten for 49 for Warwickshire v Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston, Birmingham in 1946.Warwickshire won the toss and batted first, scoring 170.  Nottinghamshire replied with 135 (Eric Hollies took ten for 49, including seven bowled and three lbw).  In their second innings Warwickshire made 113.
