He gained recognition for his action as a tank gunner in France in which he destroyed four tanks in a day, including three Tigers (Tiger tanks numbers 312, 009 & 314). One of his opponents on that day, 8 August 1944 near St. Aignan de Cramesnil, France was the German tank commander Michael Wittmann; whether Ekins fired the round that destroyed Wittmann's Tiger is disputed. Ekins died on 1 February 2012.", "link_mentions": {}}}
