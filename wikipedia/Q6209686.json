Radley-Walters commanded a tank squadron in the regiment. His unit may have killed \"tank ace\" Michael Wittmann of the 12 SS Panzer division. Schwere SS-Panzerabteilung, though there is no definitive proof. This claim has been disputed by 3 Troop, A Squadron, 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry tank regiment gunner Joe Ekins, who also claims to have killed Wittmann. The investigative TV program Battlefield Mysteries investigated the competing claims and concluded that, based on the measured ranges and location of the strike on Wittman's tank, one of the Sherbrooke tanks was probably responsible. Their position was 150m from Wittman, and on the same side as the strike. The Northamptonshire tanks were over a kilometer away and on the opposite side."]}, {"page": "Ekins", "response": ["*Joe Ekins (b. 1924), British army soldier"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 1 February \u2013 Joe Ekins, 88, soldier."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2012", "response": ["*Joe Ekins, 88, British World War II soldier."]}]}}
