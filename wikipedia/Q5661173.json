The Merry Men rob him to pay Sir Richard at the Lee's debt. Later, he is scheduled to perform the marriage of Alan-a-Dale's sweetheart to her unwanted wooer, until Robin intervenes. He also appears in the archery contest scene, where the Queen (here Eleanor of Aquitaine) attributes his refusal to bet on Robin more to greed than to the impropriety of his betting. The Hereford Bishop appears in the anime series Robin Hood no Daib\u014dken voiced by Yuu Shimaka, and is portrayed as a greedy bishop of Nottingham and ally to Baron Alwyn (the main antagonist) who desires Marian Lancaster for the Lancaster's wealth; however, he later betrays the Baron near the end and join with Robin and his friends to overthrow his unstable leader. The role of the Bishop of Hereford was played by Harold Innocent in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. In this version, he is depicted as a corrupt clergyman who supports the Sheriff and insists to Robin that the latter's father admitted to being a devil-worshiper.
