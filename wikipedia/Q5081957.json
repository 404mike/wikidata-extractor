Read was based at the Queen's Club in London, and beat C. Bannister of the Bath Club 15\u20135, 15\u201313 at the Bath Club to win the first English professional championship title. Read then defended his title as English champion three more times until 1928.\nRead was born in Kensington, London to Alfred, a whitesmith, and Clara Read. When the British Open men's championship was instituted in 1930, Read was officially designated the first title holder, and thus played in the first final as the 'defending champion'. The 41-year-old Read, however, lost the inaugural final series, played in home and away legs, 6\u20139, 5\u20139, 5\u20139 and 3\u20139, 5\u20139, 3\u20139 in December 1930 to the 25-year-old challenger Don Butcher, a professional player from the Conservative Club in London.\nRead was a versatile sportsman, having also been British professional champion at Lawn Tennis and Rackets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Squash (sport)", "response": ["The (British) Squash Rackets Association (now known as England Squash) conducted its first British Open championship for men in December 1930, using a \"challenge\" system.
