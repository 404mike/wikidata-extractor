After the expulsion of its Bishop in 1526, and the unsuccessful attempts of the Berne reformer Guillaume (William) Farel, Calvin was asked to use the organisational skill he had gathered as a student of law to discipline the \"fallen city\" of Geneva. His \"Ordinances\" of 1541 involved a collaboration of Church affairs with the City council and consistory to bring morality to all areas of life. After the establishment of the Geneva academy in 1559, Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement, providing refuge for Protestant exiles from all over Europe and educating them as Calvinist missionaries. These missionaries dispersed Calvinism widely, and formed the French Huguenots in Calvin's own lifetime and spread to Scotland under the leadership of John Knox in 1560. Anne Locke translated some of Calvin's writings to English around this time. The faith continued to spread after Calvin's death in 1563 and reached as far as Constantinople by the start of the 17th century."]}, {"page": "Penguin poetry anthologies", "response": ["Francesco Petrarca - Geoffrey Chaucer - Thomas Wyatt - Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey - Anne Locke - George Gascoigne - Edmund Spenser - Fulke Greville - Philip Sidney - Walter Ralegh - George Chapman - Henry Constable - Mark Alexander Boyd - Samuel Daniel - Michael Drayton - John Davies of Hereford - Charles Best - William Shakespeare - John Davies - John Donne - Ben Jonson - Lord Herbert of Cherbury - William Drummond of Hawthornden - Mary Wroth - Robert Herrick - George Herbert - John Milton - Charles Cotton - Thomas Gray - Charlotte Turner Smith - William Blake - Robert Burns - William Wordsworth - Samuel Taylor Coleridge - Robert Southey - Mary F.
