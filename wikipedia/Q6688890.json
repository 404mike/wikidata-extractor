From there, it was a short step to the recently formed Gay Sweatshop and, in 1976, a three-month tour of Jill Posner's coming-out play Any Woman Can, which provoked bomb threats. In 1979, she directed her last production with this company, The Dear Love of Comrades by No\u00ebl Greig, about the 19th-century socialist utopian, and early LGBT activist, Edward Carpenter. The following year, at her instigation, the first women's festival was held at the Action Space (now the Drill Hall) which trailblazed the future of lesbian theatre, such as Susan Griffin's Voices staged by Diuguid. She also formed the Women's Project Company (with Kate Crutchley, 1979) and directed several other plays: Louise Page's Tissue (1978), the first play about breast cancer; No\u00ebl Greig's Angels Descend On Paris (1980), concerning the Nazi persecution of gays and Jews; Timberlake Wertenbaker's New Anatomies (1981); and Patterns (1984), by her own company, Changing Women."]}, {"page": "Alphonsia Emmanuel", "response": ["Emmanuel was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1983 to 1984.
