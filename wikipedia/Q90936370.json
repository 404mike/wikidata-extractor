She is the scribe behind the Fenwick Notes, an autobiographical and poetic commentary Wordsworth dictated to her over a six-month period between January and June 1843. Her friendship inspired Wordsworth to write \"On a Portrait of I.F., painted by Margaret Gillies\" and \"To I.F.\"\u2014a sonnet in which he calls her \"The star which comes at close of day to shine,\" a reference to their bond formed late in life.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Taylor (dramatist)", "response": ["His father George was a friend of William Wordsworth. In 1823, on a visit to the Lake District, Henry Taylor made the acquaintance of Robert Southey, and they became friends.

She became a close friend of Wordsworth in later life, as she had been of Taylor up to the time of his marriage. Though Fenwick was not herself a writer, her friendship left an enduring impression on the writings of Taylor and Wordsworth.

Instead, the ode, like The Prelude and Tintern Abbey, places an emphasis on how an adult develops from a child and how being absorbed in nature inspires a deeper connection to humanity.Gill 1989 p. 10 The ode focuses not on Dorothy or on Wordsworth's love, Mary Hutchinson, but on himself and is part of what is called his \"egotistical sublime\".Bateson 1965 p. 160 Of his childhood, Wordsworth told Catherine Clarkson in an 1815 letter that the poem \"rests entirely upon two recollections of childhood, one that of a splendour in the objects of sense which is passed away, and the other an indisposition to bend to the law of death as applying to our particular case.... A Reader who has not a vivid recollection of these feelings having existed in his mind in childhood cannot understand the poem.\"Mahoney 1997 qtd p. 198 Childhood, therefore, becomes a means to exploring memory, and the imagination, as Wordsworth claims in the letter, is connected to man's understanding of immortality. In a letter to Isabella Fenwick, he explained his particular feelings about immortality that he held when young:Beer 1978 pp. 105\u2013107 \"I was often unable to think of external things as having external existence, and I communed with all that I saw as something not apart from, but inherent in, my own immaterial nature.\"Beer 1978 qtd p. 107 These feelings were influenced by Wordsworth's own experience of loss, including the death of his parents, and may have isolated him from society if the feelings did not ease as he matured.Beer 1978 pp. 107\u2013108"]}, {"page": "Dora Wordsworth", "response": ["Dorothy \"Dora\" Wordsworth (16 August 1804 \u2013 9 July 1847) was the daughter of poet William Wordsworth (1770\u20131850) and his wife Mary Hutchinson. Her infancy inspired William Wordsworth to write \"Address to My Infant Daughter\" in her honour. As an adult, she was further immortalised by him in the 1828 poem \"The Triad\", along with Edith Southey and Sara Coleridge, daughters of her father's fellow Lake Poets. In 1843, at the age of 39, Dora Wordsworth married Edward Quillinan. While her father initially opposed the marriage, the \"temperate but persistent pressure\" exerted by Isabella Fenwick, a close family friend, convinced him to relent. "]}, {"page": "Edward Quillinan", "response": ["In 1821 Quillinan retired from the army, and settled at Spring Cottage, between Rydal and Ambleside, and thus in the immediate neighbourhood of Wordsworth, whose poetry he had long devotedly admired. Scarcely was he established there when a tragic fate overtook his wife, who died from the effects of burns, 25 May 1822, leaving two daughters. Wordsworth was godfather of the younger daughter, and he wrote an epitaph on Mrs. Quillinan. Distracted with grief, Quillinan fled to the continent, and afterwards lived alternately in London, Paris, Portugal, and Canterbury, until 1841, when he married Wordsworth's daughter, Dora Wordsworth. The union encountered strong opposition on Wordsworth's part, not from dislike of Quillinan, but from dread of losing his daughter's society. He eventually submitted with a good grace, due to the persuasion of Isabella Fenwick, and became fully reconciled to Quillinan, who proved an excellent husband and son-in-law. In 1841 Quillinan published The Conspirators, a three-volume novel, embodying his recollections of military service in Spain and Portugal. In 1843 he appeared in Blackwood as the defender of Wordsworth against Walter Savage Landor, who had attacked his poetry in an imaginary conversation with Richard Porson, published in the magazine. Quillinan's reply was a cento of all the harsh pronouncements of the erratic critic respecting great poets, and the effect was to invalidate as a whole criticisms that might have been defensible individually. Landor dismissed his remarks as \"Quill-inanities;\" Wordsworth himself is said to have regarded the defence as indiscreet."]}, {"page": "Fenwick (surname)", "response": ["*Isabella Fenwick (1783 \u2013 1856), British amanuensis and writer of Fenwick Notes"]}, {"page": "Fenwick Notes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Isabella Fenwick"]}, {"page": "Fenwick's Notes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Isabella Fenwick"]}]}}
