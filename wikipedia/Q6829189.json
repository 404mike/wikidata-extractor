In that eight-year period, much of the leadership left the organisation, including most of the children of both Lloyd Arthur Meeker and Martin Cecil, 7th Marquess of Exeter, who had been prominent in the network. From 1988 to 1996, more than two thirds of the participants in Emissaries of Divine Light left as well. Many ex-members became bitter about their experience and launched accusations against the organization.  One member, Robert Coates, even began playing football in one of the group's most sacred spaces."]}]}}
