He played as a defender.\nRowe began his career just up the Lancashire coast at Ron Suart's Blackpool in 1963. He made his debut on 1 February 1963, in a draw at Wolves. He went on to make a further ten league appearances in the 1963\u201364 season and scored one goal, in a 3\u20132 victory over Blackburn Rovers at Bloomfield Road on 30 March 1963.\nIn 1964\u201365, Rowe was a regular in the defence, making 23 league appearances and scoring four goals. The following season, 1965\u201366, saw him make limited appearances, just thirteen overall. The same applied for 1966\u201367.\nIn Stan Mortensen's first full season in the manager's hotseat, Rowe again only saw action for a quarter of the season. He did score his first goal in two season, however, in a 2\u20131 win at Norwich City on 20 April 1968.\nSeason 1968\u201369 saw Mortensen move Rowe into a forward position for part of the season. It seemed to work, as he finished third-top scorer behind Alan Suddick and Ronnie Brown with six goals. This included a hat-trick in a 6\u20130 whitewash of Bury at Bloomfield Road on 23 November 1968.\nIn 1969\u201370, Rowe made just six league appearances. He scored one goal in the League Cup, in a 3\u20131 second-round victory over Gillingham on 3 September 1969.\nRowe's final season at Blackpool, 1970\u201371, saw him make five league appearances, partly because he joined Tranmere Rovers on loan during the season. He scored in the League Cup again, this time in a 4\u20131 victory over Newport County on 9 September 1970.\nHis final appearance for Blackpool occurred on 13 April 1971, in a draw at Stoke City.\nRowe finished his career with Bolton Wanderers in 1972, making six appearances for the Trotters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southport", "response": ["* Graham Rowe, footballer"]}, {"page": "History of Blackpool F.C. (1962\u2013present)", "response": ["For the 1971\u201372 season, Bob Stokoe began player clearout, with a view to trimming a large playing staff. Amongst those leaving were Fred Pickering, Fred Kemp, Alan Taylor, Graham Rowe and Jimmy Armfield. The latter had retired from playing after the final game of the previous season, against Manchester United at Bloomfield Road, after giving seventeen years of service to the club. His 569 Football League appearances for the club remains a record."]}]}}
