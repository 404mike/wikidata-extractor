He was one of the earliest contributors of the field of radiobiology.  A summary of his work is given below.  Amongst many other achievements, he defined a unit of radiation dosage which was later named after him as an SI unit, the gray.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northwood, London", "response": ["* Scientist Louis Harold Gray (1905\u20131965) worked at the Mount Vernon Hospital and died in Northwood in 1965."]}, {"page": "Cavendish Laboratory", "response": ["*Louis Harold Gray "]}, {"page": "Gray (unit)", "response": ["The gray is also used in radiation metrology as a unit of the radiation quantity kerma; defined as the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all the charged particles liberated by uncharged ionizing radiation in a sample of matter per unit mass.  The gray is an important unit in ionising radiation measurement and was named after British physicist Louis Harold Gray, a pioneer in the measurement of X-ray and radium radiation and their effects on living tissue. ", "In 1940, Louis Harold Gray, who had been studying the effect of neutron damage on human tissue, together with William Valentine Mayneord and the radiobiologist John Read, published a paper in which a new unit of measure, dubbed the \"gram roentgen\" (symbol: gr) was proposed, and defined as \"that amount of neutron radiation which produces an increment in energy in unit volume of tissue equal to the increment of energy produced in unit volume of water by one roentgen of radiation\".  This unit was found to be equivalent to 88\u00a0ergs in air, and made the absorbed dose, as it subsequently became known, dependent on the interaction of the radiation with the irradiated material, not just an expression of radiation exposure or intensity, which the roentgen represented. In 1953 the ICRU recommended the rad, equal to 100\u00a0erg/g, as the new unit of measure of absorbed radiation. The rad was expressed in coherent cgs units.

The CCU decided to define the SI unit of absorbed radiation as energy deposited by reabsorbed charged particles per unit mass of absorbent material, which is how the rad had been defined, but in MKS units it would be equivalent to the joule per kilogram. This was confirmed in 1975 by the 15th CGPM, and the unit was named the \"gray\" in honour of Louis Harold Gray, who had died in 1965. The gray was thus equal to 100\u00a0rad.
