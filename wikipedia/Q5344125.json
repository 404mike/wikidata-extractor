The ship was the 38-gun Carr\u00e8re under Captain Claude-Pascal Morel-Beaulieu, carrying 300 barrels of powder and escorting a convoy of small coastal vessels carrying military supplies from Porto Ercole to Porto Longone.Clowes, p. 451 Although Carr\u00e8re turned away from the British pursuit and actively engaged the lead ship Pomone with her stern-chasers (cannon mounted in the rear of the frigate), Carr\u00e8re was too laden to escape her opponents. After a ten-minute chase as Pearl cut off the route to Porto Longone and Pomone manoeuvered into a firing position, Captain Morel-Beaulieu surrendered. Losses on Pomone were limited to two killed and four wounded, two of whom subsequently died; Carr\u00e8re had suffered \"tolerably severe\" casualties in the engagement from a complement of 352. The delay caused by the brief chase however had allowed the coastal ships to disperse and flee so that all of them avoided capture and some even reached Porto Longone."]}, {"page": "HMS Peterel (1794)", "response": ["Peterel was commissioned in April 1794 under Commander Stephen Church.

Commander John Temple succeeded Ogle in January 1796. By 31 May Peterel had joined Horatio Nelson's squadron patrolling off Genoa. On that day Peterel was part of a small squadron under Nelson in  that captured six French vessels that were carrying military supplies from Toulon to St. Piere d'Acena for the siege of Mantua.

It was then that one of the temporary governors of the Ragusan Republic, Biagio Bernardo Caboga, openly sided with the Austrians, dismissing the part of the rebel army which was from Konavle. Meanwhile, another leader of the insurrection, \u0110ivo Natali, was still waiting with his men outside the Plo\u010de Gates. After almost eight years of occupation the French troops marched out of Dubrovnik; 138 guns and 500 men were lost. On the afternoon of 28 January 1814 the Austrian troops and 100 British marines made their way into the city through the Pile Gates. With Caboga's support, General Milutinovi\u0107 ignored the agreement he had made with the Ragusan nobility in Gru\u017e and proceeded to occupy the city. British losses were no more than one killed and 10 wounded. The Austrians had suffered a little more with around thirty casualties with most of these coming from the assault on Fort Imperial on Srd hill. There were reinforcements of British troops of the 35th regiment of foot from HMS Elizabeth  which had arrived with Edward Leveson-Gower on the 29th, but he declined to take part in the negotiations seeing that Hoste had everything under control."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1806 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Leveson-Gower"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1802 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Captain Edward Leveson-Gower"]}]}}
