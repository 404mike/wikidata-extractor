It was shortlisted for the 2007 Man Booker Prize and is the Winner of the 2008 Commonwealth Writers' Prize: Best Book From Europe & South Asia. Sinha's narrator is a 19-year-old orphan of Khaufpur, born a few days before the 1984 Bhopal disaster, whose spine has become so twisted that he must walk on all fours. Ever since he can remember, he has gone on all fours. Known to every-one simply as Animal, he rejects sympathy, spouts profanity and obsesses about sex. He lives with a crazy old French nun called Ma Franci, and his dog Jara. Also, he falls in love with a local musician's daughter, Nisha.", "Indra Sinha begins Animal\u2019s People with the editor's note: \"This story was recorded in Hindi on a series of tapes by a nineteen-year-old boy in the Indian city of Khaufpur. True to the agreement between the boy and the journalist who befriended him, the story is told entirely in the boy\u2019s words as recorded on the tapes.\" Although this premise is entirely fictional, Sinha wanted to convey the story in a way that gave authority and a singular voice to the real, but little known aftermath of a gas leak in India that is considered the world's worst industrial disaster, the Bhopali disaster. The \"recorded tapes\" are arranged in a largely linear manner that is interrupted with flashbacks that skip between the past and present. They impart the story gradually, developing the setting and characters of Animal's past while simultaneously incorporating ongoing events. Animal tells his story in the past-tense, as he is repeating experiences to Jarnalis via the tapes. The first and second tapes introduce Animal as the narrator and establish the audience as nothing more than disembodied \"eyes.\" In the middle of the second tape, Animal jumps back to when he was six years old and the pains of his apparent morph from \"human to animal\" that occurred as his spine twisted to the point where he had to walk on all fours. He then quickly fast-forwards in tape three to the meeting of present characters: Nisha and Zafar, then interjects a narration that describes the current appearance of the Kampani's factory. The story continues in this flitting manner to uncover the full depth of the situation through Animal's unexpectedly fierce and spirited narration, giving an unconventional take on the idea of \"distant sufferers.\"", "Animal\u2019s People is primarily a first-person monologue in which the narrator (Animal) details past events of his life and his internal thoughts from that time to an audience whose existence he is aware of. On occasion the novel changes to a third-person narrative where Animal narrates another character's independent experiences, such as Elli's interactions with her ex-husband in Tape Twenty. In both cases, the story, though it occurred in the past, is presented in the present tense. Despite the fact that the novel details past events, Animal is not presented as an omniscient narrator\u2014the reader is never informed beyond Animal himself (the character rather than the narrator) in the context of the story. This, in addition to Sinha's use of present tense to describe past events causes the reader to experience Animal's life (in the form of direct speech) alongside him while still allowing for commentary from a narrator who has already lived through these experiences (usually in the form of indirect speech). Thus, the reader is caused to identify more strongly with Animal's own thoughts, emotions, and desires as the story unfolds\u2014something that falls in line with Indra Sinha's past career writing emotionally charged advertisements for charities such as Amnesty International.", "The story told by Indra Sinha in Animal\u2019s People is one that is obviously influenced by the Bhopal disaster from 1984, and the way Sinha wants the world to see the disaster.

Retrieved 13 November 2013. However, his goal was to instead tell the aftermath of the disaster which he does through the lens of Animal.

Animal's language (Khaufpuri) requires readers to recognize phonetic similarities to English and etymological cues (e.g. Hindi, French) in order to ascribe meaning to the text. The inclusion of a Khaufpuri Glossary in Animal's People substantiates the cultural richness of Animal and the Khaufpuri people while successfully reminding the reader of the \"otherness\" of Animal. Sinha's melding of linguistic traditions enhances the meaning of the text and artistic freedom of the author.", "Indra Sinha's description is similar to the real factory in Bhopal, India.
