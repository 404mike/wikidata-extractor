He was most recently the assistant manager at National League North club Spennymoor Town.\nParnaby graduated from Middlesbrough's academy, playing on loan for Halifax Town in 2000 before making his Middlesbrough debut in 2002. He went on to make more than 100 appearances for Middlesbrough's first team and was part of the team that finished as runners-up in the 2005\u201306 UEFA Cup. Parnaby joined Birmingham City in 2007 and helped them win promotion to the Premier League as runners-up in the 2008\u201309 Championship. He was an unused substitute as Birmingham beat Arsenal at Wembley Stadium in the 2011 League Cup Final. After four years with the club, a time disrupted by injury, he was released at the end of the 2010\u201311 season. After a year without a club, Parnaby rejoined Middlesbrough in 2012 but struggled with injuries before leaving two years later. He spent a season with Hartlepool United before retiring in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Durham, England", "response": ["*Stuart Parnaby, former Middlesbrough footballer"]}, {"page": "Nicky Hunt", "response": ["The departure of Sam Allardyce to Newcastle United and his eventual replacement by Gary Megson saw Hunt fall out of favour at the Reebok Stadium and he joined Championship club Birmingham City on an emergency one-month loan deal as cover for the injured Stuart Parnaby and Stephen Kelly on 3 November 2008. He made his debut the same day, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Coventry City at St Andrew's. The loan was extended for a further month, but on 30 December, a 24-hour recall clause in the loan agreement was invoked and the player returned to Bolton."]}, {"page": "Nathan Ellington", "response": ["After failing to settle in the area, Ellington submitted a transfer request in the 2007 January transfer window, which was reluctantly accepted by West Bromwich Albion. However, Albion chairman Jeremy Peace qualified this by stating that \"...no-one will leave unless it suits us.\" Ellington was also still seen as an important part of the squad by manager Tony Mowbray. Wigan Athletic again expressed an interest in re-signing the player, but failed to meet Albion's valuation. Ellington therefore remained at the Midlands club, returning to the first team at the start of February after a month out due to a stress-related illness. Ellington won West Brom's official goal of the season competition for 2006\u201307, for his dipping, swerving half volley against Cardiff City, scored in a 1\u20130 win on 20 February 2007. One week after that goal, he received the first red card of his career, for a dangerous tackle on Middlesbrough's Stuart Parnaby. Albion subsequently lost the 5th round FA Cup replay on penalties. Ellington featured regularly towards the end of the season, helping Albion reach the play-offs, but in the play-off games he was used only as a substitute. Albion lost 1\u20130 to Derby County in the final at Wembley."]}, {"page": "Tony McMahon", "response": ["He was increasingly involved with the first team, and on 3 October 2004, after Franck Queudrue failed a late fitness test, the 18-year-old McMahon made his senior debut in the starting eleven for a 1\u20131 Premier League draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford. He made a European debut on 21 October in the UEFA Cup group stage away win at Egaleo, and continued in the team well into December, mostly as a starter, taking his appearance tally to 14. His performances earned plaudits from Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen, Middlesbrough team-mate Ray Parlour, and manager Steve McClaren, who said that \"If anyone can handle Old Trafford in the way in which Tony did on his debut, then we know that he can be relied on in the future. He did well again at Blackburn and, while he is still very young, he can have a bright future if he continues to learn and make progress.\" After Boro's injury crisis eased with the return of more established defenders in Michael Reiziger and Stuart Parnaby, McMahon played little in the second half of the season. In February 2005, his contract was extended to run until June 2008. In mid-March, he started in the 1\u20130 away defeat against Sporting CP in the last 16 of the UEFA Cup that eliminated Middlesbrough from the competition, but suffered knee damage that required surgery and six weeks' rehabilitation. McMahon made 19 appearances during the season, and was voted the club's Players' Young Player of the Year."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Smith (footballer, born 1987)", "response": ["In June 2008, it was reported that Championship side Sheffield Wednesday were interested in acquiring Smith on loan for the first half of the 2008\u201309 campaign. It was later announced, on 1 July 2008, that the midfielder had joined Sheffield Wednesday on a loan deal until 10 January 2009. He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the season, replacing Jermaine Johnson with twenty minutes remaining in a comfortable 4\u20131 win over Burnley at Hillsborough. Smith started his first match three days later, on 12 August 2008, in the club's 2\u20132 draw with Rotherham United in the League Cup. Smith made infrequent appearances in his first three months with Wednesday, starting just four games up during his loan spell, as well as making a further nine appearances from the substitute's bench. This was not helped by the first red card of his career in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Birmingham City, receiving a four-match ban \"for leading with his elbow in a challenge on Stuart Parnaby\". After serving the suspension, Smith was unable to hold down a place in the Sheffield Wednesday first-team, returning to Chelsea upon the expiry of his loan deal in early January 2009."]}, {"page": "Billy Paynter", "response": ["Paynter had his contract with Carlisle United cancelled by mutual consent and joined League Two rivals Hartlepool United on 27 June 2015. He was appointed as club captain by manager Ronnie Moore. He made his debut in the 2\u20130 win over Morecambe in the first game of the 2015\u201316 season, scoring the opening goal and providing an assist for Rakish Bingham. Three days later, Paynter scored in his second game to help Hartlepool beat Fleetwood Town 1\u20130 in the first round of the League Cup. His total of 15 goals in 35 appearances in the 2015\u201316 season made him the club's top-scorer and caused new manager Craig Hignett to exercise a contract clause to keep Paynter at the club for another year. He was out injured in January with an Achilles problem, and underwent surgery to correct the issue two months later. Hartlepool were relegated into non-league at the end of the 2016\u201317 season, and Paynter admitted that he did not know what manager Dave Jones had been doing with his tactics. Paynter was one of three men \u2013 along with Stuart Parnaby and Ian Gallagher \u2013 tasked with assisting caretaker-manager Matthew Bates for the final two games of the season, which ended in a defeat and a victory, but ultimately relegation. Paynter was released in May 2017."]}, {"page": "Gr\u00e9tar Steinsson", "response": ["Ahead of the 2007\u201308 season, on 2 July 2007, AZ Alkmaar announced they had accepted a \u20ac3.5 million bid from Middlesbrough. Gareth Southgate had seen him as an ideal replacement for Stuart Parnaby. After the bid was accepted, however, AZ backtracked, claiming the price wasn't high enough and requested Middlesbrough to raise their bid to \u00a34m. Instead, Middlesbrough turned their attention to Charlton Athletic right back Luke Young, who ended up making the move, ending Middlesbrough's interest in Gr\u00e9tar. After a failed transfer move in the summer, Gr\u00e9tar continued to impress when he set up a goal for Ari, in a 4\u20130 win over VVV-Venlo in the opening game of the season. Then, on 31 August 2007, he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3\u20130 win over Excelsior. After suffering from a back injury that plagued since his international career in October, Gr\u00e9tar made a return from injury for a match against N.E.C. Nijmegen on 3 November 2007, where he set up two goals, in a 4\u20130 win. He then scored again on 30 December 2007, in a 1\u20130 win over Heracles Almelo. Amid a transfer move to Bolton Wanderers, He made his last appearance for the club on 13 January 2008, where he played 13 minutes, in a 6\u20131 defeat to Ajax.

On 3 February, Boro hosted Arsenal in the second leg; Keown was sent off at the end of the first half for a professional foul on Maccarone. In the second half, Boudewijn Zenden put Middlesbrough ahead and Edu equalised.
