He has also had small parts in other television series.\nOn 12 April 2011, Regan was charged with the murder of a doorman in Liverpool and remanded in custody to await trial.

All the while, a strong political undertone was evident in the writing of Brookside's earliest episodes and characters would often be seen debating political issues of the time."]}, {"page": "List of Brookside characters", "response": ["|Terry Sullivan || Brian Regan||1982\u20131997"]}, {"page": "Barry Grant", "response": ["In his early years, writers portrayed a close friendship and double-act between Barry and Terry Sullivan (Brian Regan). Writers ended this when they created an affair between Barry and Terry's wife, Sue Sullivan (Annie Miles). Producers then turned Barry into a murderer when he kills Sue and her young son Danny, by pushing them off a scaffolding. The story helped celebrate Brookside's 1000th episode and was played out as a \"whodunit\" story, with viewers initially unaware that Barry was responsible. Another notable plot included scenes in which Barry threatens to kill a dog. The story created controversy with viewer complaints and news stories. Other stories include his association with gangster Tommy McArdle (Malcolm Tierney), his relationship with  Tracy Corkhill (Justine Kerrigan) and her subsequent pregnancy. The character has proved popular with television critics and journalists, who often commented on Barry's numerous crimes and \"bad boy\" persona. Usher's performance was so memorable that Barry was still critiqued twenty years after Brookside was cancelled by Channel 4.", "Barry's association with gangster Tommy McArdle (Malcolm Tierney) during 1984 created problems for the Grants. Barry had nearly been caught committing crimes and his deals with Tommy brought his family \"pain and despair\".Redmond 1987, p.102. After five years on-screen, writers began to humanise Barry more. Redmond described a more \"thoughtful and conscience\" Barry, who had \"mellowed with age\". The change did not last as Barry became a source of evil in storylines. Originally depicted as Sheila's protector and a \"Jack the lad\" type character, with money making scams alongside his best friend Terry Sullivan (Brian Regan).Tibballs 1992, p.46. Barry viewed himself as a \"hard case\" always willing to defend his family using violence. Stories which involved Barry with serious gangsters such as Tommy and Sizzler (Renny Krupinski) transformed the character into a sinister one. Usher was delighted with the changes and thought it made the character more complex. He told Geoff Tibballs, author of Brookside - The First Ten Years, that \"I'm glad we're seeing the nasty side of Barry Grant, I wanted to make him more evil. He's a more interesting character than just a Mammy's boy.\" Writers had made him a \"man of power\" and to facilitate this they made him a property owner, purchasing the shops on Brookside Parade. The power Barry gains corrupts him and with stories involving shot gun toting threats and murder, they showed he was unpleasant and nasty. Barry became self-serving and bitter towards Sheila for moving in with Billy Corkhill (John McArdle). Another showing of his newfound wealth was having a celebrity opening of his restaurant. Producers hired Paul O'Grady for a cameo appearance as his drag queen persona Lily Savage for the opening."]}, {"page": "Mick Johnson", "response": ["Emerick had been unable to pay off a telephone bill and a woman named Rita offered to pay it.
