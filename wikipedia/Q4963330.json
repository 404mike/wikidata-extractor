Composers who have written for the Group in the past include Brian Chapple, Judith Bingham, Elizabeth Maconchy, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Alex Roth, Malcolm Williamson, Piers Hellawell and Christopher Gunning. Many of these works are now prominent in the established canon of choral music that is available for upper voices. FCMG continues to perform these works regularly; for example, Aunt Vita by Christopher Gunning was premi\u00e8red at St John's, Smith Square in 2002 and was showcased again at the East Finchley Festival in 2003.  Brian Chapple's  two works Songs of Innocence and its companion Songs of Experience have become an integral part of the repertoire of the Choir; the former was performed in 1994, 1995 and 2003 and the latter in 2002."]}, {"page": "Chapple", "response": ["* Brian Chapple, English composer"]}, {"page": "Chapple, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Chapple"]}]}}
