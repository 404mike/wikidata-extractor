A long-time question among fashion historians and experts about whether the suit was made by Chanel in France or a quality copy purchased from New York's semiannual Chez Ninon collections, was resolved by Coco Chanel's biographer, Justine Picardie. She showed that the suit was a garment made by Chez Ninon using Chanel's approved \"line for line\" system with authorized Chanel patterns and materials.", "There was long a question among fashion historians and experts whether the suit was made by Chanel in France or a garment purchased from New York's Chez Ninon, a popular dress shop that imported European label designs and materials and put them together in the United States. A number of sources claimed it was more than likely a version of a Chanel pink boucl\u00e9 wool suit trimmed with a navy blue collar, some asserting it was made by Chez Ninon in 1961. Further complicating the matter was the indisputable fact that the First Lady's \"official\" designer was Oleg Cassini, who provided much of her public as well as private wardrobe.Oleg Cassini, In My Own Fashion (1987), pp. 297-299. In her 2010 authorized biography of Coco Chanel, Justine Picardie resolved the matter, stating the fabric, buttons and trim for the jacket came from Chanel in Paris, from which the suit was made and fitted for Kennedy at Chez Ninon, using Chanel's approved \"line for line\" system. Picardie insists this system had nothing to do with forgery or trademark infringement, since Chanel supplied the materials to Chez Ninon. The purpose of buying the suit from Chez Ninon was not to save money\u00a0\u2013 the costs were the same\u00a0\u2013 but to appear patriotic to the American electorate by buying her garments from the United States rather than France. The suit in 1963 was estimated to cost $800 to $1,000 ($6,646 to $8,307 in 2019 dollars)."]}, {"page": "Llanedeyrn High School", "response": ["* Justine Picardie, author and journalist"]}, {"page": "Patric Walker", "response": ["Writing for The New York Times, William Grimes described Walker's horoscope columns as having \"a literary sense and an urbane outlook on life rare for the genre\".
