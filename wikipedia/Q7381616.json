Keable studied conducting at the Royal College of Music with Norman Del Mar and later with George Hurst. Since 1983, he has been the principal conductor of London\u2019s Kensington Symphony Orchestra, and since 2006, the principal conductor of the University of Surrey\u2019s University Symphony Orchestra and Choir.  Since 2006, Keable has taught conducting at the University of Surrey.Keable is a champion of rarely heard 20th Century works. A supporter of music of Erich Korngold, he gave the British premiere of Die tote Stadt in a concert performance. His research in LA led to the first live performance of Korngold's film score The Sea Hawk. He is a noted advocate for British composers. With the Kensington Symphony Orchestra, he has led first performances of works by many British composers, including Peter Maxwell Davies, John Woolrich, Robin Holloway, David Matthews and John McCabe. He has also made recordings of several works by Robert Simpson.  His 2004 performance of the premiere of Errollyn Wallen\u2019s Spirit Symphony won the Ivors Composer Award in the BBC Radio 3 Listeners\u2019 category in 2005.Keable has written works for many British ensembles. His opera, Burning Waters, was commissioned by the Buxton Festival and premiered in 2000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Storr", "response": ["British composer Matthew Taylor composed the orchestral piece Storr, which takes its name and inspiration from the rock formation, which the composer found awe-inspiring on a visit there.

This also includes music by William Walton and Dmitri Shostakovich.", "The work's documented (?) recent performance history is brief, and consists of approximately three recordings: a 1989 studio recording by Bryden Thomson and the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra,noted in the British Library Sound Archive Catalogue the 1995 recording with Russell Keable conducting the Kensington Symphony Orchestra (above noted), and (later broadcast) performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Nicholas Kok in May 2001.

By this time the balance had shifted firmly towards amateur players. Changes in conservatoire curricula during the 1970s had meant that their students no longer needed KSO to bridge the gap.  And so, the age range of the orchestra had begun to broaden, as had the geographical spread of its players, who came from all over London and, occasionally, beyond. The 30th anniversary concert in 1986 was celebrated with an all-British programme of Walton, Bax, Stanford and Wilfred Josephs in the Queen Elizabeth Hall. This marked KSO\u2019s South Bank d\u00e9but. \u201cIt was,\u201d says Keable, \u201calso a milestone in terms of performance quality.\u201d At around this time the orchestra began to give concerts in St John's, Smith Square.  \u201cIt was a really happy orchestra, and that was absolutely key in its development. If an orchestra is happy socialising it will play better,\u201d said Keable.", "The orchestra is more involved than ever in promoting new compositions. In 2004 KSO commissioned and premiered Hovercraft by Joby Talbot, which he then incorporated into the ballet Chroma by the Royal Ballet in 2007.  Also in 2004, the orchestra together with the BBC Concert Orchestra premiered Errollyn Wallen\u2019s Spirit Symphony \u2013 Speed-Dating for Two Orchestras, conducted by Russell Keable and broadcast live on BBC Radio 3. That performance won the BBC 3 Listeners\u2019 Award in 2005.
