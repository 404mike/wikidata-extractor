This came after a series of errors earlier in the season against Crystal Palace, Watford, Arsenal, and Everton. This error spell, like last season, resulted in calls from fans for Dean Henderson to be made Manchester United's first choice goalkeeper. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r backed De Gea saying, \"one day [Henderson will] be England's and United's Number 1\" but that De Gea was currently \"the best goalkeeper in the world\". However, de Gea continued his error-prone season in United's FA Cup Semi-final tie against Chelsea, where he was directly responsible for one of the goals in a 3\u20131 defeat. This came one week after reaching a number of landmarks and records for United including becoming the most capped non-British or Irish player to play for United, achieved on 9 July, and reaching 400 appearances for the club on 13 July. On 16 July 2020, he also kept his 112th PL clean sheet against Crystal Palace, equalling Peter Schmeichel\u2019s club record in the top flight. On the last day of Premier League, De Gea kept his 113th PL clean sheet against Leicester City and surpassed Schmeichel's record.", "The return of Dean Henderson from an extended loan spell at Sheffield United meant De Gea went into the 2020\u201321 season with a true competitor for Manchester United's number 1 jersey for the first time since joining the club. De Gea began the season as first-choice, missing just two of the club's first 26 league matches: he was left out of the squad for the match against West Ham United on 5 December 2020 after aggravating an injury suffered in the club's previous league game against Southampton, while Henderson was preferred against Sheffield United on 17 December. On 2 February 2021, De Gea played the full 90 minutes and kept a clean sheet in Manchester United's Premier League record-equalling 9\u20130 home win against Southampton.", "Regarded as a highly promising prospect in his youth, De Gea soon developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the world, with some in the sport even labelling him as the current best keeper in the world. De Gea grew up playing futsal as an outfield player until the age of 14, which has helped with his footwork; he has also incorporated various futsal goalkeeping techniques in his play style which shows in his ability to make athletic saves with his feet. His unorthodox, yet effective, goalkeeping style of making saves with his feet accredited with changing goalkeeping. An elegant and athletic keeper, De Gea is known in particular for his outstanding reflexes, agility, and shot-stopping ability between the posts, as well as his penchant for saving the ball with his feet, which enable him to produce acrobatic dives and spectacular saves. Former goalkeeper Shay Given labelled De Gea as the best shot-stopper in the world in 2018. Furthermore, he has stood for his consistency, composure, leadership, and his positional sense. Due to his slender frame, he initially struggled at defending high balls as a youngster, often punching balls away rather than holding on to them, and was at times reluctant to come off his line. He has since shown great improvements in his aerial prowess, handling, command of his area, decision making, and ability to come out and claim crosses, in particular after he developed physically and gained more experience, even being described as a \"strong presence in the box\" by Kyle Diller in 2012. However, in later seasons, his ability to come off his line and deal with crosses was once again cited as a weakness in his game, in particular in comparison to teammate Dean Henderson.
