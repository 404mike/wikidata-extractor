He never married.Praed followed his father into politics, also sitting for St Ives after being elected a Conservative MP at a by-election in 1838\u2014caused by the death of James Halse. He held the seat until his own death in 1846.Upon his death in 1846 at his home in St James's Place, London, the entire of his freehold property was passed to his sister, Elizabeth, wife of Richard Hoare, and, upon her death, to special trusts. His furniture, plate, and other effects at his mansion in Trevethow, Cornwall, were passed to his nephew, Charles Praed, son of Charles Backwell Praed. His shares in the Grand Junction and Grand Union Canal companies were bequeathed in portions as well as several pecuniary legacies. He also passed \u00a31,000 to charities, in sums of between \u00a350 and \u00a3100. A further \u00a3100 was given to the Rector of Lelant, Cornwall to be distributed in the parish, \u00a3100 to Cornwall County Infirmary, and \u00a3100 to the Buckinghamshire Infirmary in Aylesbury. The remainder of his estate was to be distributed between his nephews and niece by his sister Sarah Arabella. In total, he died with around \u00a345,000 in wealth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Ives (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["There was a further bitterly contested election in 1774: allegations of bribery were investigated by a House of Commons committee, whose proceedings are recounted at length by the contemporary historian of electoral abuses, Thomas Oldfield. Samuel Stephens, defeated by 7 votes, accused William Praed and Adam Drummond (the Duke of Bolton's candidate) of benefiting from several types of corruption. Humphrey Mackworth Praed, William's father, was said to have lent large sums to voters on the understanding that repayment would not be demanded if they voted for Praed and Drummond; but opposing counsel adduced evidence that Stephens had also resorted to bribery. However, it was alleged that many of Stephens' supporters had been prevented from voting, by rating them as not liable for scot and lot and so not eligible to vote; this disenfranchisement was a frequent abuse in such boroughs.  His side, as petitioners, failed to bring any evidence of criminal misconduct by the parish overseers so the committee decided they had no jurisdiction to interfere. In the end, the committee upheld Drummond's election and declared that neither Stephens nor Praed had been properly elected, thus a writ was issued for a by-election to fill the second seat.", "| William Praed ", "|rowspan=\"5\"| William Praed"]}]}}
