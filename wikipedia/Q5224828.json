He played a one-two with Smith before shooting past Weaver from around .  Taylor added a second goal five minutes later: he found Asaba with a header and received a backheeled return pass before scoring with a shot.  With only a minute of normal time left, and two goals behind in the game, many City fans considered that the game had been lost and began to make their way to the exits.   However, after Darren Carr had tackled Goater to deny him a goal-scoring opportunity, Horlock scored from the rebound for City to halve the deficit in the 90th minute.  In the fifth minute of injury time, Wiekens punted the ball forward, Horlock and Goater helped it on to Dickov who scored an equalising goal.  The regulation 90 minutes ended moments later, and with the scores level the game went into extra time.  Dickov saw his header gathered by Bartram and although Hodge's cross was blocked by Jeff Whitley's hand, no penalty was awarded.  With no goals being scored in the additional 30 minutes, the match and promotion to the First Division would be decided by a penalty shoot-out.", "|DF ||14 ||Darren Carr ||  || "]}, {"page": "1993 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|CB ||5 ||Darren Carr"]}, {"page": "1995 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["|CB ||5 ||Darren Carr"]}, {"page": "History of Plymouth Argyle F.C.", "response": ["But Warnock was sacked within a year as the club narrowly avoided being relegated back to the basement division.
