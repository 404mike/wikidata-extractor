His batting and bowling styles are unknown.Dupuis is first recorded playing for Hornchurch against Moulsey Hurst Cricket Club at Moulsey Hurst in July 1787. In August of the same year, he was in the Hornchurch/Essex team for the return match at Langton Park, in which Moulsey Hurst combined with the White Conduit Club (WCC; the match has also been titled \"Essex v WCC\"). No scorecard has survived although the teams and the result are known. It is in this teamsheet that Dupuis is termed The Reverend Mr Dupuis.He played in two successive matches at Lord's Old Ground in May and June 1791, first for an Old Etonians cricket team (having been educated at Eton College) against the Gentlemen of England; secondly for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the Gentlemen of Kent (this game being Lord Frederick Beauclerk's debut at Lord's). In August 1792, Dupuis made his last known first-class appearance for MCC against Berkshire at the Old Field ground.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dupuis (surname)", "response": ["* George Dupuis, cricketer of the late 18th century", "* George Dupuis (cricketer, born 1835) (1835\u20131912), English schoolmaster, clergyman and cricketer"]}, {"page": "G.

He was a middle-order batsman at Eton and played in the annual Eton v Harrow match for three seasons from 1851: it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed. At Cambridge University he went straight into the university's first team in the 1854 trial match, but he failed to make runs in that or subsequent matches across the next two seasons and could not secure his place. In 1856, he played only a single first-class game for a \"Gentlemen of England\" amateur side. He did not win a Blue for appearing in the University Match against Oxford University until his fourth year at the university, which was his most successful in cricket; in the 1857 game, he scored 23 and 35 not out, which was his highest first-class score, and took his only first-class wicket. His comparative inactivity as a university cricketer may be explained by an anecdote recounted by H. S. Altham; Dupuis, Altham wrote, \"was refused leave by the Dean of King's to play in a University match on the score that the proper place for a scholar of King's on a Saturday afternoon was in chapel\"."]}, {"page": "Dupuis, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Dupuis"]}, {"page": "John Dupuis Cobbold", "response": ["John was born at The Cliff, Ipswich.
