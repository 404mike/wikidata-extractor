Parker wrote many plays, developing a reputation for historical works. His 1911 play Disraeli is one of his best known, written as a vehicle for the actor George Arliss who later won an Academy Award for his performance in the 1929 film adaptation, itself based on his earlier 1921 silent film version.\nIn 1905, he staged the Sherborne Pageant, and in 1906, the Warwick Pageant, huge productions involving 800\u2013900 participants.  Their success inspired a wave of \"pageantitis\" in England, including several more by Parker.", "link_mentions": {}}}
