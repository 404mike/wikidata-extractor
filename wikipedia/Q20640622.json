The couple married in February 1948 a few months after their first meeting. At the time, Jean Osborne was living in abject poverty but things did not immediately improve with marriage as her husband Dennis described a particularly bleak Christmas Eve in Belfast in the early 1950s:\"...when everybody was getting ready to have a good time, I didn't have a bean. [...] I went into a pub and said, 'Anybody want to buy a painting? Ten Quid.' I was lucky to sell it. That was our Christmas day.\"In her graduation year Osborne was selected to show alongside other leading Ulster artists including Kathleen Bridle, John Luke, Dan O'Neill, and Deborah Brown, at the exhibition of Contemporary Ulster Art at the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery, which formed part of the Festival of Britain.

Toogood showed a painting of Larne and three lino-cuts of which the critic in the Northern Whig stated that they \"all have a vitality and purposefulness that are individual.\"", "\"The painter's aim, I think, is to find in nature some sense of formal order, and to translate the same in terms of form and colour into a pattern which relates to the size and shape of his canvas, the degree of abstraction used depending on the individual painter.\"Snoddy, (2002), p.658The Academy elected Toogood an associate in 1935, inaugurated with Kathleen Bridle, Colin Middleton, Helen Brett, Patrick Marrinan, Maurice Wilks and William St. John Glenn.
