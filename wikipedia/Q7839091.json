Posted to British India with the 70th Regiment, he helped deal with the Indian Mutiny of 1854. Sent to the Antipodes, he served in the New Zealand Wars and later in Australia. He returned to New Zealand in 1865 as a major general and commander of all British forces in the country. He led a four-week campaign during the Second Taranaki War to destroy Maori resistance in the Taranaki. The campaign was the last to be carried out in New Zealand by imperial troops. At the end of his service in New Zealand, he went back to Australia. Knighted in 1867, he returned to England in 1870 with the last of the Imperial forces garrisoning Australia. Promoted to General in 1877, he retired from the British Army four years later. He died in 1886 at Berkshire in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "County Kerry", "response": ["*Trevor Chute"]}, {"page": "Taranaki", "response": ["The present main highway on the inland side of Mount Taranaki follows the path taken by the colonial forces under Major General Trevor Chute as they marched, with great difficulty, from Patea to New Plymouth in 1866."]}, {"page": "Second Taranaki War", "response": ["On 2 September 1865, Grey proclaimed peace to all M\u0101ori who had taken part in the West Coast \"rebellion\", but with little effect.

Further skirmishing took place near Hawera and Patea in October and November. Cameron's replacement, Major-General Trevor Chute, arrived in New Plymouth on 20 September to take command of operations just as Premier Frederick Weld's policy of military self-reliance took effect and the withdrawal of British troops from New Zealand began.

Premier William Fox said the development heightened \"the probability of a combined attack on the settled districts in the neighbourhood of Auckland\" and both Houses of Parliament accepted government motions asking Major-General Sir Trevor Chute, commander of the British forces in New Zealand, to cancel orders for a planned withdrawal of the 18th Regiment, the sole remaining British regiment in New Zealand. Yet Binney has  speculated that history could well have turned had T\u0101whiao decided to join Te Kooti's campaign. In official correspondence between Auckland and London in 1869, Governor George Bowen advocated granting \"a separate principality\" for T\u0101whiao as a means of attaining peace, while the British government similarly urged the colonial government to \"cede the lands conquered by the Queen's troops\" and surrender \"the Queen's sovereignty\" in those areas, while recognising \"absolute dominion\" by the King within his borders. Premier Fox, who was desperately trying to cut military expenditure, strongly opposed proposals for M\u0101ori self-government under the M\u0101ori king, as urged by Bowen and former Chief Justice Sir William Martin, but the formation of a more robust pan-M\u0101ori alliance could have become a tipping point to create a system of separate M\u0101ori rule in their territory."]}, {"page": "T\u012btokowaru's War", "response": ["The immediate cause of the war was the confiscation of vast areas of M\u0101ori land in Taranaki by the Government under the powers of the punitive New Zealand Settlements Act 1863.

T\u012btokowaru declared 1867 to be a year of peace and reconciliation and travelled among local tribes urging them to accept that the war was over.

About 100 metres of 3.6m-high loose palisading had been hastily erected in a concave shape, blocking the path to the p\u0101, while other defensive works included a long trench 2m wide and 2m deep behind the palisade, as well as hidden rifle pits and three taumaihi, 6m-high towers built of packed soil and ferns. While men in the trenches could fire through a gap beneath the palings of the palisade, others on an earth bank behind the trenches could fire through gaps in the palings, while a third line of fire could be effected from the taumaihi. T\u012btokowaru had placed his men on high alert and in the misty dawn, sentries caught sight of Whitmore's advance guard moving through the bush. The Moturoa defenders were silently roused and took their firing positions without being seen by the attacking force."]}, {"page": "William Manley", "response": ["He also served in the same war under Sir Trevor Chute, and was present at the assault and capture of the Okotukou, Putahi, Otapawe, and Waikohou Pahs.
