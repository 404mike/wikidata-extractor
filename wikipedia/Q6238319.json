After playing amateur football as a youth, he was appointed manager of Accrington Stanley in 1897. He was in charge of the team for 13 years, leading them to two Lancashire Combination titles, before moving to nearby Burnley in July 1910. His 14-year spell as secretary-manager of Burnley was highly successful and guided the team to an FA Cup victory and a Football League championship. Haworth is the only Burnley manager to date to have won the FA Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burnley F.C.", "response": ["Harry Windle was named chairman in 1909, after which the club's finances turned around.Simpson (2007), pp. 119, 186 He appointed manager John Haworth in 1910,Simpson (2007), p. 542 who changed the club's colours from green to the claret and blue of Aston Villa, the then First Division champions, as Haworth and the Burnley committee believed it might bring a change of fortune. In 1912\u201313, they won promotion to the first tier and reached the FA Cup semi-final. Burnley won their first major honour the following year, beating Liverpool in the 1914 FA Cup Final. Bert Freeman scored the only goal, as Burnley became the first club to defeat five top tier sides in one cup season. Tommy Boyle became the first captain to receive the trophy from a reigning monarch (King George V).Simpson (2007), pp. 130\u2013132 The team finished second to West Bromwich Albion in 1919\u201320, before winning their first ever First Division championship in 1920\u201321. Burnley lost the opening three games, but went unbeaten in the following thirty league matches, setting an English record.Simpson (2007), pp. 150\u2013151 Haworth's death in 1924 was followed by a steady deterioration of their position, which culminated in demotion in 1929\u201330.Simpson (2007), pp. 529, 542 They struggled in the second tier and avoided a further relegation in 1931\u201332 by two points.Simpson (2007), p. 529 The years through to the outbreak of the Second World War were characterised by mid-table league finishes.", "In the early years, Burnley used various kit designs and colours. Throughout the first nine years, there were various permutations of blue and white, the colours of the club's forerunners Burnley Rovers.Simpson (2007), p. 586 After two years of claret and amber stripes, for much of the mid-1890s a combination of black with amber was used, although the team wore a shirt with pink and white stripes during the 1894\u201395 season. Between 1897 and 1900, the club used a plain red shirt and from 1900 until 1910 it wore an all-green jersey. In 1910, Burnley changed their colours to claret and blue, which they now have had for most of their history, save for a spell in white shirts during the 1930s and the Second World War. The adoption of the claret and blue combination paid homage to Football League champions Aston Villa, who wore those colours. Burnley's committee and manager John Haworth believed it might bring a change of fortune. The club decided to re-register its colours as claret and blue in 1946, partly due to readers' letters to the Burnley Express.", "Burnley-born Harry Bradshaw was Burnley's first manager and was the first to win a league title with the club, taking them to the top of the Second Division at the end of the 1897\u201398 season.Simpson (2007), p. 540 John Haworth was the first manager in the club's history to win a major honour, the FA Cup in 1914; under Haworth, Burnley also became champions of England for the first time in 1920\u201321. Harry Potts led the club to its second First Division title during the 1959\u201360 campaign.
