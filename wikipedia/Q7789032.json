(Mar. 1952), pp. 44\u201347. One of these instruments was a bellows-blown 'Bagpipe, Scotch', with three drones, whose keyless chanter had a one-octave range from G to g, with each note being sounded by uncovering a single hole, as in the modern instrument. This seems to have been a closed-ended chanter, for the lowest note is sounded by uncovering the lowest finger-hole \u2013 there was no bell-note, sounding with all holes covered; further, Talbot did not give the bore of the chanter, suggesting that it could not easily be measured.John Goodacre, A Closed-ended Smallpipe Chanter from the 17th Century, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v.19, 1998. The three drones were in unison with the lowest note, G, of the chanter, the D a fourth below it, and G, an octave below. It has been argued that such instruments were derived from mouth-blown German three-drone bagpipes.The Origins of the Northumbrian Smallpipes, Ernst E. Schmidt, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v.21\u201322, 2000\u20132001. These instruments seem to have been well-established in Northumberland by the early 18th century; many of the tunes in the William Dixon manuscript are suitable for such simple sets, and a painting  FARNE Archive. of Joseph Turnbull, Piper to the Duchess of Northumberland, in Alnwick Castle, shows him with such a set. When Thomas Doubleday published an open letter in 1857, to the Duke of Northumberland about the \"ancient music of Northumberland\", he wrote that \"The Northumbrian pipe is played upon by means of the method called 'close fingering', for which it is calculated. This method of stopping allows only of one finger being lifted at a time. Thus this instrument is limited to a single octave; and this (little as it is) admits of all the airs, to which it is really suited, being executed by its means; with the additional improvement that it may be played perfectly in tune, whilst the tones it produces being staccato and of a clear, ringing, pearly and brilliant character, gives the instrument a power which its appearance by no means promises, and which is really surprising when the diminutive size of its chanter or melody-pipe is considered\".  This is still a valid description of the unkeyed instrument, its repertoire, and proper playing style."]}, {"page": "An Essay on the Principle of Population", "response": ["William Godwin criticized Malthus's criticisms of his own arguments in his book Of Population (1820).
