The match finished goalless, and the Athletic News correspondent wrote how he \"tackles well and with good judgment, and kicks splendidly in any position, his only weakness being his heading\", and \"bids fair to develop into a really good full-back.\" He played once more in what remained of the season, and returned to the side in late September. In his second match, he injured a knee, was confined to bed for some weeks, and was then referred to a Manchester hospital for further treatment. He played no more first-team football that season, but was fit enough by March to be on the winning side for the \"A\" team against Hebburn Argyle in the 1906 Durham Senior Cup Final, and his services were retained for another year."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Watson (footballer born 1877)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Watson (footballer, born 1877)"]}, {"page": "Burnbank Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Other former Burnbank players include Tommy Cairns, Bobby Shearer, Willie Telfer and Jimmy Watson who all went on to win full international caps for Scotland later in their careers."]}]}}
