Commissioned by the Fires of London and premiered 24 September 1981 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, A Day in the Life of a Mayfly soon became Payne's best known work up to that point. He continued his renewal of the English tradition in his next major orchestral work, The Spirit's Harvest, which was his second commission for the Proms. Throughout the 1980s he engaged in a variety of genres; he wrote solo, choral, orchestral, brass and chamber works. Also in the 1980s, he held various academic posts. He spent 1983 as a visiting professor at Mills College, California and from 1983 to 1985\u20136 taught composition at the London College of Music.
