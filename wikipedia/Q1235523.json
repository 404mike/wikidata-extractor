Lister began teaching on the first day of October. The hospital made it mandatory that all students should attend Lister's lecturers.  Attendance was small compared to the four hundred who would regularly attend his classes in Edinburgh. Lister's conditions of employment were met, but he was only provided with 24 beds, instead of the 60 beds that he was used to in Edinburgh. Lister stipulated that he should be able to bring from Edinburgh four people who would constitute the core of his new staff at the hospital. These were  Watson Cheyne who became his assistant surgeon, John Stewart, an anatomical artist and senior assistant, along with W.H. Dobie and James Altham who were Lister's dressers (surgical assistants who dressed wounds). There was considerable friction at Lister's first lecture, both from students who heckled him and staff. Even the nurses were hostile. This was clearly illustrated in October 1877 when a patient, Lizzie Thomas, who travelled from Edinburgh Royal Infirmary to be treated for a Psoas abscess, was not admitted due to not having the correct paperwork. Lister could hardly believe that such a lack of sympathy from imperious nurses could exist. More so, such a state of mind was a real danger to his patients, as it depended on loyal staff to carry out the preparations required for antiseptic surgery."]}, {"page": "Royal College of Surgeons of England", "response": ["| Sir William Watson Cheyne || 1914\u201316"]}, {"page": "William Watson", "response": ["* Watson Cheyne or Sir William Watson (1852\u20131932), 1st Baronet Cheyne, Scottish surgeon and bacteriologist"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh and St Andrews Universities (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir Watson Cheyne"]}, {"page": "William Watson Cheyne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Watson Cheyne"]}, {"page": "List of people born at sea", "response": ["| Watson Cheyne, 1st BaronetCheyne, Sir William Watson, 1st Baronet.
