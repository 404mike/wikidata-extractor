His personal best jump of 5.82 metres, set in July 2012, is the former British record for the event. Indoors his best is 5.77 m, achieved in Dessau on 2 March 2012.Lewis was born in Stoke-on-Trent, and he attended Holden Lane High School. Originally a hurdler, he switched to pole vaulting.  Lewis finished in fourth place at the 2009 European Indoor Championships with jump of 5.71 m, which resulted in British head coach Charles van Commenee praising his development.He represented Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics and is a three-time medalist for England at the Commonwealth Games. He has participated at the World Championships in Athletics on five occasions (2007, 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015) and was a finalist on multiple occasions. He has been a finalist at the IAAF World Indoor Championships three times.\nLewis achieved a personal best and broke the British record of 5.80 m set by Nick Buckfield in 1998, with a vault of 5.82 m at the 2012 Janusz Kusoci\u0144ski Memorial in Szczecin, Poland. He competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, finishing in fourth place with a vault of 5.75 m, becoming Britain's most successful men's pole vault Olympian. \nIn 2014, he won the Commonwealth title, completing a full set of Commonwealth medals. \nInjured in 2016 Lewis missed the Rio Olympic Qualification Standard and retired in early 2017 in Reno, Nevada.  Lewis is considered one of the most successful British pole-vaulter of all time after representing Great Britain in major championship finals consistently over a 12-year period, winning 13 national titles, breaking junior and senior records, and winning international medals. His British record was broken by Harry Coppell at the 2020 British Athletics Championships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Lewis", "response": ["Steve Lewis, Stephen Lewis, or Steven Lewis may refer to:", "*Steven Lewis (born 1986), British pole vaulter"]}, {"page": "Newham and Essex Beagles", "response": ["|Steven Lewis ||  || pole vault || 2008, 2012"]}, {"page": "2003 World Youth Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|Steven Lewis|| 5.05 "]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|Steven Lewis||NMR||-"]}, {"page": "2007 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's pole vault", "response": ["|  || B ||align=left| Steven Lewis ||align=left|  || xxx || || || ||  ||"]}, {"page": "2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships \u2013 Men's pole vault", "response": ["| 15 || Steven Lewis ||  || 5.35 || || O || - || XXX || colspan=2|"]}, {"page": "Nick Buckfield", "response": ["His personal best jump was 5.80 metres, achieved in May 1998 in Chania.
