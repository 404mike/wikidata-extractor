In 2005, he joined Crystal Palace, progressing through the youth ranks before making his first-team debut at the age of 17. Following his breakthrough season during the 2007\u201308 campaign, Hills was loaned out to Colchester United in November 2008, although only made two appearances. He also had a brief loan spell at Oldham Athletic in 2009. Towards the latter stages of the 2009\u201310 season, Hills suffered a knee injury that would ultimately keep him sidelined for the best part of two years. In March 2012, he joined Southend United on loan for the remainder of the 2011\u201312 campaign. On returning to Palace, he was told he would be released when his contract expired. In July 2012, Hills signed for League One club Stevenage on a free transfer, but would move to Whitehawk just over a year later. He has also represented England at both U18 and U19 level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Sheehan", "response": ["Sheehan gained two assists in a 2\u20130 win over Carlisle United. Carlisle's manager Greg Abbott proclaimed after the match that Sheehan was 'Premiership Class'. He scored his first Oldham goal in a 2\u20131 win over Milton Keynes Dons on 29 September 2009. Sheehan's impressive performances for Oldham led to discussions with Leeds about the possibility of extending his loan for a second month. On 2 October 2009, his loan was subsequently extended until 1 November. His form for Oldham alerted scouts at other clubs with Nottingham Forest reportedly interested in signing Sheehan. On 1 November, Sheehan returned to Leeds United, with Oldham playing Leeds twice during the month of November. On 5 November, Oldham decided to sign Lee Hills on a one-month loan from Crystal Palace as opposed to extending Sheehan's loan spell once more."]}, {"page": "Lee Hills", "response": ["Lee Hills may refer to:", "*Lee Hills (journalist) (1906\u20132000), former editor and publisher of the Miami Herald", "*Lee Hills (footballer) (born 1990), English player currently a free agent"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["Palace took the lead through Shefki Kuqi early on but goals from Jamal Campbell-Ryce, an own goal by Palace youngster Lee Hills and Michael Mifsud gave the Reds a vital three points."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": [" | align=left|2 || align=left|DF || align=left|Lee Hills"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["| Lee Hills"]}, {"page": "Sam Deering", "response": ["Deering joined Cheltenham Town on 5 July 2012, spending two years at Whaddon Road before moving to Conference South side Whitehawk in 2014.
