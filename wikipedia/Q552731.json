Bowie later said that it was a Christmas present for his son, Duncan Jones, then 7 years old. Afterwards, Bowie returned to Switzerland, where he was approached by director David Hemmings to appear in his upcoming film Just a Gigolo. Bowie agreed to the project due to wanting to work with Hemmings, whom he called \"a real actor's director\", the idea of starring in a film set in pre-Holocaust Berlin, and after learning actress Marlene Dietrich would be coming out of her almost two-decade-long retirement to star in the film. Shooting began in January 1978 and was troublesome: Bowie filed for divorce during shooting and Dietrich refused to leave her Paris apartment. Thus, the two never met and their scenes were shot separately and spliced together for the finished product. Released in February 1979, Just a Gigolo was panned by both critics and audiences.

Between the Montreaux and New York sessions, Bowie traveled to Kenya with his son Duncan Jones, which inspired the lyrics for \"African Night Flight\". The same trip, along with ones to Japan and Australia, inspired \"Move On\", which reflects the theme of wanderlust throughout side one. Regarding the song titles, Doggett quips, \"After his 'African Night Flight', what else to do but 'Move On'!\" When asked about \"Red Sails\", Bowie said in 1979: \"Here we took a new German music feel and put it against the idea of a contemporary English mercenary-cum-swashbuckling Errol Flynn, and put him in the China Sea. We have a lovely cross-reference of cultures. I honestly don't know what it's about.\" Pegg writes that \"Red Sails\" symbolises Bowie's venture away from the mainstream. \"Yassassin\" is Turkish for 'long live', from the word ya\u015fas\u0131n. Like the instrumental \"Heroes\" track \"Neuk\u00f6ln\", the song is about the discrimination Turkish immigrants who lived in Berlin faced, although its lyrical approach is more direct."]}]}}
