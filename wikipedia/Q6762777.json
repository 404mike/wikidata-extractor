The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were Marie Brema, Edward Lloyd and Harry Plunket Greene.Moore, p. 331 The first performance was, famously, a near disaster.

He sang mixed programmes, but his performance of German lieder, and especially of Brahms, in German, was greatly admired.

She also gave the first London performance of Brahms's D minor Violin Sonata, also with Joachim.  In her accompaniment of Joachim in the Brahms Hungarian Dances (April 1892), Shaw referred to her 'curious tricks and manners which so often suggest wicket-keeping rather than piano-playing.' She was accompanist for lieder recitals given in 1894\u20136 by the baritone David Bispham, in Schumann and Brahms (including the Op. 112 Liebeslieder); and in Brahms lieder for Gervase Elwes and Marie Brema on their German tour in 1908."]}, {"page": "Edward Lloyd (tenor)", "response": ["In that performance Harry Plunket Greene sang the baritone roles and the angel was sung by Marie Brema. Gerontius was not only the pivot of Elgar's career as a composer, but a transforming event in musical history. Lloyd's career, rooted in an older musical idiom, was by then almost complete and it was left to a younger generation, notably the tenors John Coates and Gervase Elwes, to immortalise both the new dynamic of the music, and themselves, in its full spiritual realisation. Elgar still hoped for Edward Lloyd to appear at a festival at Covent Garden in March 1904, (to include Gerontius, The Apostles and Caractacus) but his wish remained unfulfilled: 'the great man will not emerge'.Young 1956, p. 133.

In June 1900 Elgar had written to August Jaeger, \"he sings both bass bits and won't they suit him. Gosh.\"Young 1956, 84. Although his recordings, and some commentators, suggest the voice was not a large one,e.g. Eaglefield-Hull 1924. it must have been capable of sustaining and projecting a considerable tone at this time, for both the Gerontius baritone solos require this. Moreover, for this most personal of his works, Elgar must have felt some real aptness in the choice."]}, {"page": "Margaret Morris (dancer)", "response": ["In 1909 Morris met Raymond Duncan, the brother of Isadora Duncan, who taught her the six Classical Greek dance positions. She adapted and used these as the basis of her own system of movement. Morris was also inspired by Duncan's use of shorthand notation for recording these positions. In 1910 she choreographed the dances for Gluck's Orpheus and Eurydice which was staged by Marie Brema at the Savoy Theatre in London. She trained the dancers in her new technique for a month before rehearsals. She also designed the costumes and decor. The Daily Express said \"The triumph of the production is Miss Morris's Dance of the Furies, nothing like it has ever been seen on the London stage\".

There was much national sympathy: in London, at Christmas, a patriotic anthology called King Albert's Book (\"A tribute to the Belgian King and people from representative men and women throughout the world\") was organised by Hall Caine with contributions from leading artists, writers and musicians.
