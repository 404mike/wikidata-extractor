As a player, he first played for Southampton but made his name playing for Arsenal in the 1930s, winning two league titles and an FA Cup, as well as five caps for England. Drake is Arsenal's joint fifth highest goalscorer of all time. He also holds the record for the most goals scored in a top flight game in English football, with seven against Aston Villa in December 1935. A former centre forward, Drake has been described as a \"classic number 9\" and as a \"strong, powerful, brave and almost entirely unthinking\" player who \"typified the English view.\"After retiring from playing football, Drake became a manager, most notably of Chelsea. In 1955, he led the club to their first league title. This made him the first person to win the English top-flight as both a player and a manager. He was also a cricketer, but only ever played sparingly for Hampshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 16", "response": ["*1912 \u2013 Ted Drake, English footballer and manager (d. 1995)"]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["Former Arsenal and England centre-forward Ted Drake was appointed manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's Chelsea pensioner crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side with shrewd signings from the lower divisions and amateur leagues, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success \u2013 the League championship \u2013 in 1954\u201355. The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League, Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was dismissed in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.", "Chelsea have had four main crests, which all underwent minor variations. The first, adopted when the club was founded, was the image of a Chelsea pensioner, the army veterans who reside at the nearby Royal Hospital Chelsea. This contributed to the club's original \"pensioner\" nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. When Ted Drake became Chelsea manager in 1952, he began to modernise the club. Believing the Chelsea pensioner crest to be old-fashioned, he insisted that it be replaced. A stop-gap badge which comprised the initials C.F.C. was adopted for a year. In 1953, the club crest was changed to an upright blue lion looking backwards and holding a staff. It was based on elements in the coat of arms of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea with the \"lion rampant regardant\" taken from the arms of then club president Viscount Chelsea and the staff from the Abbots of Westminster, former Lords of the Manor of Chelsea. It also featured three red roses, to represent England, and two footballs. This was the first Chelsea crest to appear on the shirts, in the early 1960s.", "| Ted Drake"]}, {"page": "May 30", "response": ["*1995 \u2013 Ted Drake, English footballer and manager (b. 1912)"]}, {"page": "1912", "response": ["** Ted Drake, English footballer (d. 1995)"]}, {"page": "1995", "response": ["* May 30 \u2013 Ted Drake, English footballer (b. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Aston Villa F.C.", "response": ["In January 1920, Billy Walker scored twice on his Villa debut in a 2\u20131 FA Cup first-round win over Queens Park Rangers; the club won the FA Cup for the sixth time that season and Walker went on to establish himself as Villa's star player of the 1920s, scoring a record 244 goals in 531 appearances, captaining Villa and England. George Ramsay retired in 1926, at the age of 71, his replacement Billy Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success, although the club did finish runners-up in the league twice under his guidance, with 128 goals scored in the 1930\u201331 season, which remains the all-time top-flight record to the present day. A remarkable 49 of the league goals that season were scored by centre-forward Tom 'Pongo' Waring, with another 30 goals from winger Eric Houghton. Villa struggled in the 1935\u201336 season, largely due to a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenal's Ted Drake in an infamous 1\u20137 defeat at Villa Park.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 71. The club made seven signings and spent a staggering sum for the time of \u00a335,500 trying to retain top-flight status at all costs, but were unable to buy their way out of trouble.

Whilst a Chelsea junior, Bonetti made five appearances for Croydon Amateurs in the Surrey Senior League thanks to youth team coach Albert Tennant who was also coaching Croydon at that time. He made his first team debut in 1960, and a few weeks later helped the Chelsea youth team win the FA Youth Cup.

He was scouted playing football while a schoolboy by Chelsea's Jimmy Thompson, and in 1955 was signed on as an apprentice to become one of \"Drake's Ducklings\" (named after manager Ted Drake in response to Manchester United's \"Busby Babes\"). He soon made an impression at youth level, scoring 51 goals in the 1955\u201356 season and 122 goals in the 1956\u201357 season under the tutelage of youth team coach Dick Foss. Greaves scored in the 1958 FA Youth Cup final, but Chelsea lost the two-legged tie 7\u20136 on aggregate after Wolverhampton Wanderers turned round a four-goal deficit with a 6\u20131 win in the second leg.

During the match, against Arsenal at White Hart Lane, Ramsey played centre-half opposite the formidable Arsenal centre-forward Ted Drake and according to McKinstry \"had the best game of his career to date.\" Drake scored twice, but Ramsey still felt that he had proven his ability to play league football. On 3 March 1945, against Luton Town at the Dell, Ramsey was switched to inside-left because of injuries elsewhere in the team; he scored four goals in a 12\u20133 Southampton win. The Southern Daily Echo reported \"he can certainly hammer a ball.\" Ramsey finished the season having made 11 League South appearances."]}, {"page": "Football records and statistics in England", "response": ["*Most goals in a top-flight game: 7, Ted Drake for Arsenal v.
