The stories revolve around the exploits of Casca Rufio Longinus, the Roman legionary who drove the Holy Lance into the side of Jesus Christ on Golgotha. As a result of this action, Casca is cursed with immortality, and he is to wander the Earth aimlessly, always as a soldier, until the Second Coming. The character is loosely based on the Longinus legend of Christianity.\nSadler wrote some of the early novels in the series while the others were assigned to ghostwriters. When Sadler died in 1989, the series was handed off to other writers. Two subsequent novels, The Liberator and The Defiant, were written by Paul Dengelegi. The current author, Tony Roberts, has written every new entry in the series since 2006, excluding Immortal Dragon and The Outlaw, which were written by Michael B. Goodwin. Immortal Dragon and The Outlaw were removed from the series in 2013 over allegations of plagiarism. An unauthorized audiobook, Casca: The Outcast, was written by Paul Dengelegi in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Longinus", "response": ["* Casca Rufio Longinus, in the Casca novel series by Barry Sadler, accidentally ingests some of Christ's blood after lancing him.
