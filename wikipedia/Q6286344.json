He scored 2,131 runs, with a top score of 93 against Derbyshire, at an average of 14.90.\nIn August 1883, he hit the 29-year-old batsman, Albert Luty, on the head with a quick delivery in a club match in Yeadon.  Luty, who had been married for only nine days at the time, succumbed to the blow and was buried in Yeadon churchyard.\nCoincidentally, Preston died after catching a chill at the age of 26 in Windhill, Yorkshire, and was also buried in Yeadon churchyard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Preston", "response": ["Joseph Preston may refer to:", "* Joseph Preston (cricketer) (1864\u20131890), English cricketer", "* Joseph Preston Jr. (born 1947), American politician from Pennsylvania"]}]}}
