The profit is evident if one checks the statistics: London has secured dominance on the global carbon trading market, with net value $64bn in 2007, according to the report by International Financial Services London. London controlled about 90% of the exchange market (Carbon credit vs money) in 2007. London-based companies made about 59% of the purchases of Carbon credits issued by the UN. And some of the carbon credit's system creators are from the UK, for example, the economist, former Senior Vice-President of the World Bank and government economic advisor in the United Kingdom Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford who has founded a consultancy-trading agency \"The Carbon Rating Agency (CRA)\" on the Isle-of-Man (controlled by firm IDEAglobal Group where Stern was a Vice Chairman at that time) for carbon credit evaluation and rating."]}, {"page": "Fellow of the British Academy", "response": ["The award of fellowship is evidenced by published work and fellows may use the post-nominal letters FBA.
