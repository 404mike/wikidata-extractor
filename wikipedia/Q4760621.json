In 2009, Drury won the FA Trophy with the club and, the next season, won promotion to The Football League. He opted against signing a new contract, instead joining Conference Premier side Luton Town. He remained at Luton for half a season before his strong performances attracted the interest of Championship club Ipswich Town. In January 2011 he moved to Portman Road in a transfer worth \u00a3150,000. He played in 64 games for Ipswich, alongside a loan spell at Crawley Town in League Two, before leaving in 2013 to sign for Crawley on a two-year contract.

Many argued the sales of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett for \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31,100,000 respectively, as well as failing to reach a deal over Andy Drury contributed to their dip in form. Three Crawley players were involved in a post-match brawl against Bradford City, including former club captain Pablo Mills (suspended for six matches) and fellow defender Claude Davis (suspended for four matches). Five players from both clubs were suspended in total equalling the record for the most dismissals in an English game. Consequently, Crawley were fined \u00a318,000. Following an FA inquiry into the events that took place, Kyle McFadzean was handed a four-game suspension after being found guilty of violent conduct. All three players have since released apology statements, and were all fined two weeks' wages.

Stevenage then drew their third game within the space of a week, playing out a 0\u20130 stalemate with Barrow at Holker Street. Three days later, Borough recorded their first win of the 2009\u201310 season, with a 3\u20130 victory over Ebbsfleet United at Broadhall Way.

Chris Beardsley scored a second half brace to ensure a four-goal cushion for the Hertfordshire side going into the second leg at Broadhall Way.
