Palmer (6 March 1877 \u2013 16 November 1949), was an English linguist, phonetician and pioneer in the field of English language learning and teaching. Especially he dedicated himself to Oral Method. He stayed in Japan for 14 years and reformed its English education.  He contributed to the development of the applied linguistics of the 20th century.\nPalmer  was born in London. In 1892-1893, he studied in France. In 1902, he went to Belgium and started teaching English at Berlitz school. In 1903, he established his own school. In 1915, he started teaching at University College London. In 1922, he was invited by Masataro Sawayanagi, Kojiro Matsukata and went to Japan. In Japan, he became 'Linguistic Adviser' to the Japanese Department of Education. In 1923, he established the Institute for Research in English Teaching (IRET), now the Institute for Research in Language Teaching (IRLT), and became the first director.  He founded the Institute's Bulletin. In 1935, he was awarded D.Litt. by Tokyo Imperial University. In 1936, he returned to England and became consultant for Longmans, Green. In 1937, he published Thousand-Word English with A. S. Hornby, the main creator of the first Advanced Learner's Dictionary.  During World War II he lived in England, and assisted the war effort with his language skills, publishing three booklets about the French language, to assist soldiers preparing for the invasion of Normandy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hepburn romanization", "response": ["Some linguists such as Harold E. Palmer, Daniel Jones and Otto Jespersen object to Hepburn since the pronunciation-based spellings can obscure the systematic origins of Japanese phonetic structures, inflections, and conjugations. Supporters of Hepburn argue that it is not intended as a linguistic tool, and that individuals who only speak English or a Romance language will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems."]}, {"page": "A. S. Hornby", "response": ["Hornby was born in Chester and educated at University College London. In April 1924 he went to Japan to teach English at Oita University (Oita Higher Commercial School at the time). He joined Harold E. Palmer in his programme of vocabulary research at the Institute for Research in English Teaching (IRET). Palmer invited him to Tokyo in April 1933 as an assistant; in 1936, Hornby became the technical adviser and editor of IRET's Bulletin."]}, {"page": "Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary", "response": ["A. S. Hornby was a teacher of English studies at a small college in Japan; he had gone there in 1923 to teach literature, but his experiences in the classroom drew his attention to the need for sound principles of language teaching. At that time Harold E. Palmer headed the Institute for Research into English Teaching in Tokyo, and in 1931 he invited Hornby to work on vocabulary development at the Institute. The result of this was the Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary, published by Kaitakusha in 1942. A year before publication, Hornby had managed to send an advance copy in sheets of the book to B. Ifor Evans at the British Council, a tough feat during the war. Ifor Evans offered him a job, and in 1942 Hornby came back to Britain and joined the Council, which posted him to Iran."]}, {"page": "Diaphoneme", "response": ["The term diaphone first appeared in usage by phoneticians like Daniel Jones, citing  and Harold E. Palmer., citing  states that Jones credited Palmer with using the term in print first, though  citing , credits Jones with pushing the concept. Jones, who was more interested in transcription and coping with dialectal variation  than with how cognitively real the phenomenon is, originally used diaphone to refer to the family of  sounds that are realized differently depending on dialect but that speakers consider to be the same; an individual dialect or speaker's realization of this diaphone was called a diaphonic variant.  Because of confusion related to usage, Jones later coined the term diaphoneme to refer to his earlier sense of diaphone (the  class of sounds) and used diaphone to refer to the variants.This is how the terms are used in  (cited in ), , and  uses diaphone in this sense but uses phoneme in place of diaphoneme."]}, {"page": "Palmer (surname)", "response": ["*Harold E.

By the year 1874, there were 91 foreign language schools in Japan, out of which 82 of them taught English. And in 1923, Englishman Harold E. Palmer was invited to Japan by the Ministry of Education, where he would later found the Institute for Research in English Teaching in Tokyo and introduce the aural-oral approach to teaching English.  However, beginning from the 1880s, when Japan was quickly becoming a modernized country, books such as Shiga Shigetaka's Nihon Jin (\u306b\u307b\u3093\u3058\u3093 or \u65e5\u672c\u4eba) (The Japanese People) began to surface in order to warn the Japanese public about the alleged dangers of Western influences. Hence, up until the end of World War II, there was a growing tension between Western ideology and national pride amongst the Japanese people."]}, {"page": "English Through Actions", "response": ["English through Actions is a book about the direct method of language education written by Harold E. Palmer and his daughter, Dorothee Palmer. It was first published in 1925 by the Japanese publisher Kaitakusha.

American linguist Kenneth Lee Pike called their analysis \"valuable\" for learners of English because it found commonalities in the various uses of rising contours and of falling contours. In 1943, Danish linguist  wrote \"there is fairly general agreement\" about the Tune 1 and Tune 2 classification; he also compares the Tune 1 and Tune 2 system of Handbook of English Intonation with the intonation classifications in An Outline of English Phonetics by Daniel Jones and English Intonation by Harold E. Palmer."]}]}}
