He spent the next few years on the fringes of the first team, playing more than half the first team games in only one season, 1953\u201354, when along with Billy Spurdle, he was Manchester City's joint top goalscorer with 12 goals.\nIn 1955, Williamson was playing in the reserves when a new tactic was tried out at the behest of Williamson and Ken Barnes. Inspired by the Hungarian team which had beaten England 6\u20133 at Wembley, Williamson was deployed as a deep-lying striker in an attempt to draw the opposing centre-half out of position. The tactic worked well, and for the start of the 1954\u201355 the first-team began to use the tactic, with Don Revie as the deep-lying forward. As a result, the tactic became known as the Revie Plan. On occasions when Revie was unavailable Williamson played the role, but made only nine appearances, and was transferred to Blackburn at the end of the season. He did not make much of an impact at Blackburn, making only nine appearances, in which he scored three goals.\nIn 1959, Williamson signed for Hyde United and played in the Cheshire County League. Earlier he had played for Ashton United in the Lancashire Combination.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Williamson", "response": ["* Johnny Williamson (1929\u20132021), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["Revie had improved his goal tally to 13 in the 1953\u201354 season, but only once the Revie Plan was implemented in the 1954\u201355 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities. The new tactic opened with a 5\u20130 defeat to Preston North End, but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside-forward and the team clicked. Though the tactic was named after Revie, it had initially been introduced at reserve team level by Johnny Williamson, though Revie's superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level. City's league title campaign fell away but they went on to reach the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3\u20131 by Newcastle United; a first-half injury to Jimmy Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively.

Before the start of the 1954\u201355 season, Manchester City manager Les McDowall called his team into pre-season training two weeks early to try the new tactic. Manchester City lost their first game using the system 5\u20130, but as the players became more used to the system it started to become more successful.

For the next three seasons, his club languished in the lower reaches of the league table. During one spell of particularly poor form in 1953, newspapers wrote of a feud between Paul and his team-mate Ivor Broadis. Paul was critical of Broadis, a talented inside-forward, but one who in Paul's view did not exert sufficient effort when defending.A Red Dragon of Wales, p. 57.

City struggled in the lower half of the table in the 1953\u201354 campaign, before exploiting the \"Revie plan\" to push on to a seventh-place finish in 1954\u201355. They also improved their FA Cup form, and reached the 1955 FA Cup Final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3\u20131 by Newcastle United; Spurdle was forced to spend most of the game playing at right-back after an injury to Jimmy Meadows left them with only ten players. The \"Sky Blues\" improved further in the 1955\u201356 season, finishing fourth and reaching the FA Cup final for a second consecutive year.
