The series is produced by Proper Television whose president, Guy O'Sullivan, was the director for the original Britain's Worst Driver series; as such, Canada's Worst Driver is considered to be the production company's flagship show. Unlike other Worst series around the world, the Canadian version emphasizes on the learning process of the contestants and the science of driving and, as such, is often more serious than the other Worst shows around the world, which are mainly played for laughs. It is the longest running of any Worst series to date with 14 seasons and 115 episodes (assuming specials are included)."]}, {"page": "Canada's Worst Handyman", "response": ["Canada's Worst Handyman was a Canadian television series that aired on Discovery Channel Canada from March 13, 2006 to June 13, 2011.
