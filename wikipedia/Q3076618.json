The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic \"girlie\" and fashion magazines, featuring high-fashion shots of scantily clad models Amanda Lear, Marilyn Cole and Jerry Hall, each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions, as well as model Kari-Ann Muller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band, and who later married Mick Jagger's brother Chris. The title of the fourth Roxy album, Country Life, was intended as a parody of the well-known British rural magazine of the same name, and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models (two German fans, Constanze Karoli\u2014sister of Can's Michael Karoli\u2014and Eveline Grunwald) clad only in semi-transparent lingerie standing against an evergreen hedge. As a result, in many areas of the United States the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover. Later, an alternative cover, featuring just a picture of the forest, was used."]}, {"page": "Pubic Wars", "response": ["In order to retain its market share, Playboy followed suit, risking obscenity charges, and launching the \"Pubic Wars\". Playboy started showing wisps of pubic hair about nine months after Penthouse (June 1970). As competition between the two magazines escalated, their photo shoots became increasingly explicit. Playboy, however, had actually first showed a very slight glimpse of any pubic hair on Melodye Prentiss' centerfold (Miss July 1968), some 15 years after the magazine's introduction. With Playmates, it was usually the case that the pubic area would be obscured by an item of clothing, a leg, or a piece of furniture. The first appearance of real pubic hair in Playboy actually occurred in August 1969 in a pictorial featuring dancer/actress Paula Kelly. A few more glimpses of pubic hair appeared in some later pictorials and centerfolds, but it was not until January 1971 when Liv Lindeland showed clearly visible pubic hair in her pictorial. The first Playmate to clearly have the first full frontal nude centerfold was Miss January 1972, Marilyn Cole. Both went on to become Playmate of the Year, respectively 1972 and 1973. When Hustler was launched in 1974, it outdid both Playboy and Penthouse in explicitness by showing more graphic photos of the female sex organs."]}, {"page": "Priory School, Portsmouth", "response": ["* Marilyn Cole, January 1972 Playmate of the Month, and Playmate of the Year 1973"]}, {"page": "Marilyn (given name)", "response": ["*Marilyn Cole (born 1949), Playboy magazine's January 1972 Playmate of the Month"]}, {"page": "Playboy Playmate", "response": ["* First Playmate to pose for a full frontal nude centerfold: Marilyn Cole (Miss January 1972)"]}, {"page": "Playboy Bunny", "response": ["* Marilyn Cole"]}, {"page": "List of Playboy Playmates of the Year", "response": ["*1973: Marilyn Cole", "*Marilyn Cole (1972)"]}, {"page": "List of people in Playboy 1970\u20131979", "response": ["| January || Willy Rey, Liv Lindeland, Crystal Smith, Claire Rambeau || Marilyn Cole || Germaine Greer ||", "| January || Linda Summers, Lenna Sj\u00f6\u00f6blom, Marilyn Cole, Deanna Baker, Ellen Michaels || Miki Garcia || Carroll O'Connor ||", "| June || Marilyn Cole || Ruthy Ross || Walter Cronkite || Marilyn Cole \u2013 PMOY"]}, {"page": "Stranded (album)", "response": ["The gatefold cover photograph was taken by Karl Stoecker and styled by Antony Price, and shows Playboy model Marilyn Cole.

The mansion was used as a training camp for Playboy bunnies and Lownes was well known for leading a \"lothario\" lifestyle and hosting extravagant parties at Stocks. His most notorious party lasted a full 25 hours and featured a funfair in the grounds, and guests drank champagne and cavorted with models and beauty queens.
