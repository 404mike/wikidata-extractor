At the beginning of the novella, Scrooge is a cold-hearted miser who despises Christmas. The tale of his redemption by three spirits (the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come) has become a defining tale of the Christmas holiday in the English-speaking world.\nDickens describes Scrooge thus early in the story: \"The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.\" Towards the end of the novella, the three spirits show Scrooge the error of his ways, and he becomes a better, more generous man.\nScrooge's last name has come into the English language as a byword for stinginess and misanthropy, while his catchphrase, \"Bah! Humbug!\" is often used to express disgust with many modern Christmas traditions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Dickens", "response": ["Dickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names.

Scrooge founded the fictional company of McDuck Enterprises and is the maternal uncle of Donald Duck and Della Duck, the maternal grand-uncle of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, a usual financial backer of Gyro Gearloose and the world's richest person, all within the context of the fictional Donald Duck universe.

Scrooge proudly asserts \"I made it by being tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties! And I made it square!\". Barks's creation is averse to dishonesty in the pursuit of wealth. When Disney filmmakers first contemplated a Scrooge feature cartoon in the fifties, the animators had no understanding of the Scrooge McDuck character and merely envisioned Scrooge as a duck version of Ebenezer Scrooge\u2014a very unsympathetic character.

This psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different Scrooges in the tale\u2014one a cold, stingy and greedy semi-recluse, the other a benevolent, sociable man. The professor of English literature Robert Douglas-Fairhurst considers that in the opening part of the book covering young Scrooge's lonely and unhappy childhood, and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty \"is something of a self-parody of Dickens's fears about himself\"; the post-transformation parts of the book are how Dickens optimistically sees himself."]}, {"page": "Character (arts)", "response": ["Dynamic characters are those that change over the course of the story, while static characters remain the same throughout.
