His work on the Vikings was highly influential, as was his scholarship on Medieval England.  Sawyer's early work The Age of the Vikings argued that the Vikings were \"traders not raiders\", overturning the previously held view that the Vikings' voyages were only focused on destruction and pillaging.Sawyer is particularly known for his annotated catalogue of Anglo-Saxon charters.  Anglo-Saxon charters are referenced by \"Sawyer\" numbers (abbreviated 'S' as for example in charter \"S 407\") according to his catalogue.\n\n", "link_mentions": []}}
