In a career which spanned 15-years either side of World War II Martin played in only 44 first-class cricket matches, mainly for Kent County Cricket Club.Martin was born in Catford in London. Most of his time was taken up with business work, and most of his cricket was played at club level for Catford Wanderers. When Martin was available for Kent his height and pace almost always made him valuable for a team mainly reliant on Fred Ridgway for pace bowling. Martin won his county cap in 1946 and in 1947, as a result of taking 4/55 for MCC against the touring South Africans and 9/98 for Kent against Hampshire, was selected for the First Test against South Africa at Trent Bridge.Although by no means genuinely fast, Martin had sufficient speed to offer contrast to an English attack dominated by spin and medium paced seam bowlers.\nDuring World War II Martin served as a battery commander in the Royal Artillery. Martin died at Woolwich in London in January 1987 at the age of 69.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Martin", "response": ["Jack Martin may refer to:", "*Jack Martin (Australian footballer) (born 1995), Australian rules footballer for Carlton", "*Jack Martin (basketball) (1922\u20132015), American college basketball coach", "*Jack Martin (baseball) (1887\u20131980), Major League Baseball player in the 1910s", "*Jack Martin (footballer, born 1882) (1882\u2013?), English footballer for Lincoln City, Blackburn Rovers, Hartlepools United in the 1900s/1910s", "*Jack Martin (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u2013), Scottish footballer, Full Back for Sheffield Wednesday and Rochdale", "*Jack Martin (cricketer) (1917\u20131987), English Test cricketer", "*Jack Martin (drag racer), American drag racing driver; see Jim Warren", "*Jack Martin (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131976), English football centre half for many teams in north-west England in the 1920s/1930s", "*Jack Martin (footballer, born 1904) (1904\u20131984), English football outside left for Darlington, Leeds, Accrington Stanley, Bury, Doncaster in the 1920s/1930s", "*Jack Martin (Influencer) (born 2000), English Call of Duty player", "*Jack Martin (ice hockey) (born 1940), former ice hockey player in the National Hockey League", "*Jack Martin (American football) (1922\u20132008), American football player", "*Jack Martin (investigator), New Orleans resident who claimed to have information about a conspiracy to assassinate President John F.

Wally Hammond saw him in the nets during the spring, and took Cook on immediately with great expectations that were amply fulfilled.Profile on CricInfo Cook, who was never known by his given name, took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, and 133 wickets in the 1946 season, when he played in the Test Trial. No great spinner of the ball, Cook relied on accuracy and flight: if he lacked penetration as a bowler, he was also very rarely mastered. In the following year with the Bristol pitch \u2013 which had caused little satisfaction for its tendency to be either a spinners\u2019 (as in 1939) or a batsman's (as in 1946) paradise \u2013 being reconditioned with a sand dressing, Cook offered superb support to Goddard to form to most difficult bowling attack in the country. Cook was called into the England team to play the South Africans on the batsman's pitch at Trent Bridge in 1947, after taking six South African wickets in the second innings of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) match in May. However, in the Test match, he took no wickets for 127 runs, scored 0 and 4, and was never picked again. The Kent fast bowler Jack Martin, who had done equally well in the MCC match, was also picked for the Trent Bridge Test, also fared badly, and was likewise discarded, never to appear in Test cricket again. In 1948, with the Bristol pitch dressed with loam instead of sand, Cook declined considerably and never threatened the superbly-skilled Australian batsmen, and in 1949 he took until August to recapture any sort of form."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Jack Martin \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Fred Ridgway", "response": ["Ridgway was born at Stockport in Cheshire on 10 August 1923. As a county cricketer, Ridgway, although not appearing a likely successful pace bowler because of his slight build, was the mainstay of Kent County Cricket Club's opening attack for a decade after World War II, except on the rare occasions that Jack Martin could get away from business. Ridgway did not play regularly in 1946, but the following year he jumped into prominence with 12 for 86 on a rain-affected pitch against Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["With Hammond having retired from international cricket, Yardley was appointed captain for the home series against South Africa. In the first Test, England recalled Eric Hollies and selected three debutants: Sam Cook, Tom Dollery and Jack Martin. Hutton, Washbrook, Edrich, Compton, Evans and Bedser were retained from the winter tour and these six with Yardley were the mainstays of the England team in 1947. There were changes again for the second Test with Charlie Barnett replacing Dollery, George Pope replacing Martin and Wright coming back in place of Cook. Bedser missed the third Test and was replaced by Cliff Gladwin while  Ken Cranston was brought in to replace Pope. In the fourth Test, Jack Young was introduced in place of Hollies and Harold Butler for Gladwin. Edrich missed the last Test, as again did Bedser, and there were yet more changes elsewhere with Dick Howorth coming in to replace Barnett and Bill Copson replacing Butler. Jack Robertson took Edrich's place. It all meant that, in a five-match series they won 3\u20130, England used 21 different players.", "Kent improved from seventh to fourth and were able to announce increased attendances and membership. The team was again captained by Bryan Valentine and featured England stars Godfrey Evans and Doug Wright, though they missed several championship matches for Test calls. Kent were particularly well served by their batsmen, although Valentine had problems with loss of form at times. Les Ames, Les Todd and Arthur Fagg all scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. The young left-hander Peter Hearn was regarded as a fine prospect and was awarded his county cap. Wright was the main bowler and was supported by off spinner Ray Dovey, all-rounder Jack Davies and the two pacemen Fred Ridgway and Norman Harding. Harding died unexpectedly in September, aged 31.Wisden 1948 \u2013 obituary, p. 783. Other players included Geoffrey Anson, Brian Edrich, the veteran Hopper Levett in his final season, Tony Mallett, future captain Bill Murray-Wood and Tony Pawson. A curious case was pace bowler Jack Martin, who played for Kent only twice in 1947 and yet was selected to play for England in the Trent Bridge Test.Playfair, pp. 89\u201390.", "At the beginning of the season, on 3, 5 and 6 May, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) played a three-day match at Lord's against the 1946 county champions, Yorkshire. MCC won by 163 runs. The MCC team in batting order was Dennis Brookes (Northamptonshire), Jack Robertson (Middlesex), Bob Wyatt (Worcestershire), Denis Compton (Middlesex), Bryan Valentine (Kent, captain), Leslie Compton (Middlesex, wicketkeeper), Wilf Wooller (Glamorgan), Haydn Davies (Glamorgan), Jack Young (Middlesex), Rowland Shaddick (Middlesex) and Jack Martin (Kent). MCC won the toss and chose to bat first but were bowled out in 57 overs for 134, Denis Compton making 73. Yorkshire got off to a very bad start when Len Hutton was dismissed by Jack Martin for nought. This began an outstanding spell for Martin who finished with six for 23 from 12.1 overs as Yorkshire collapsed to 81 all out. At close of play on the Saturday, MCC were 67 for one with Jack Robertson 36 not out. On the Monday, Robertson built a big innings and scored 164 of a declared total of 343 for 9. Yorkshire's hopes slumped when Hutton was again dismissed cheaply and at close of play they were 69 for two. Vic Wilson tried his best and scored 74, which was his highest career score to date, but Jack Young was in fine form and took six for 85 to win the match for MCC.CricketArchive \u2013 MCC v Yorkshire 1947.
