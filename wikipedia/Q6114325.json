Harry Beadles had arrived at the club from Liverpool immediately following the end of the previous season and had been part of the club's overseas tour. He had previously had a trial at the club after the First World War which had proved unsuccessful.

The club also signed Joe Nicholson from Clapton Orient and Tom Sloan from Linfield, as well as James McLean from amateur side Barn Athletic, a player who was regarded as deaf and dumb although he never played for the first team."]}]}}
