Watford's Danny Shittu had an early goal disallowed and shortly after, Nick Barmby put Hull City ahead, with a sidefooted shot from a Fraizer Campbell pass.  Campbell then hit the post from an Andy Dawson  cross, but the rebound was picked up and guided into an empty net by Dean Windass, doubling Hull's lead.  With thirty minutes of the match remaining, the referee Kevin Friend showed John Eustace a straight red card for an infraction after a tackle.  Shittu was then substituted with an unspecified injury and the match ended 2\u20130. The second leg was played at the KC Stadium three days later.  Darius Henderson opened the scoring on 12 minutes to halve Watford's deficit across the legs, but Barmby equalised before half time.  Second-half goals from Caleb Folan, Richard Garcia and Nathan Doyle ensured a dominant win for Hull, 4\u20131 on the day and 6\u20131 on aggregate.", "|DF ||2 ||Nathan Doyle"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Nathan Doyle"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Nathan Doyle"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"|Nathan Doyle", "|Nathan Doyle", "|Nathan Doyle"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["| 39 || MF || Nathan Doyle || 7 || 0", "| Nathan Doyle", "|Nathan Doyle"]}]}}
