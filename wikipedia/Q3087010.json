His television career began with providing musical scores for a pair of short films by Lotte Reiniger, and composing short pieces for use in television continuity. Around this time he began his involvement with the animator Gordon Murray, firstly with A Rubovian Legend, and later the Trumptonshire trilogy of children's TV programmes. Phillips wrote individual songs for the characters in the latter programmes for Brian Cant to perform, as well as the title music.\nPhillips also provided many of the sound effects for the programmes, and was known for his experimental attitude towards creating the sounds he wanted, including use of an early multitrack recording system, reverb, and adjustment of tape speed to create different effects. Many of Phillips' recordings were made available as vinyl records, particularly the Trumptonshire and Rubovia series. Phillips died in Ewell, Surrey, in October 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Camberwick Green", "response": ["The series was written and produced by Gordon Murray and animated by Bob Bura, John Hardwick and Pasquale Ferrari.
