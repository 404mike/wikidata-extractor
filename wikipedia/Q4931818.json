This perceived dominance is not borne out by statistics; Morris' average was 57.42 in the 37 Test innings in which he faced Bedser, and more than sixty in the 46 first-class innings when the two met. In their last meeting at Test level in 1954\u201355, Morris scored 153. The pair were very close friends, and Bedser frequently made the point of rebutting criticism of Morris' performance against him. Bedser noted Morris' gracious demeanour despite his struggles, recalling an incident during the 1950\u201351 season when Morris reached his century during a tour match against the English. Instead of thinking of his difficulties against Bedser, Morris commented on the plight of his English opponents who had suffered harder times. Morris stated that \"Bob Berry hasn't got a wicket and John Warr hasn't taken a catch all tour so I'll see what can be done.\" Morris was then caught by Warr from Berry's bowling without adding to his score.McHarg, p. 180."]}, {"page": "Les Jackson (cricketer)", "response": ["After many delays, including the outbreak of World War II, Jackson became a professional with Worksop in 1947, playing in the Bassetlaw League and joined Derbyshire later in the 1947 season, making his first-class debut against Kent on 5 July 1947.

In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less.p70, Swanton The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; the rest of the team had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle.p69, Swanton Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either.p146, Andrew Ward, Cricket's Strangest Matches, Robson Books, 2001 In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.pp22-26, pp214-228, Fingletonp402, Colin Frith, Pageant of Cricket, Macmillan Company of Australia, 1987pp9-12, O'Reilly", "Alec Bedser dominated the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) as much as Len Hutton did the batting and by the end of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world.p13, Kay He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both.pp22-23, Kay Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel.p61, Kay Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane.p56, Frank Tyson, In the Eye of the Typhoon, The Parrs Wood Press, 204 He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright.p26, Kay Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler.pp21-22, Kay Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen."]}, {"page": "Bob Berry", "response": ["Bob Berry may refer to:", "*Bob Berry (cricketer) (1926\u20132006), English Test cricketer", "*Bob Berry (businessman), CEO Tri-B nursery", "*Bob Berry (dendrologist) (1916\u20132018), New Zealand farmer and creator of Hackfalls Arboretum, Tiniroto, Gisborne", "*Bob Berry (American football) (born 1942), former NFL quarterback", "*Bob Berry (ice hockey) (born 1943), coach and player for the NHL"]}, {"page": "List of Lancashire County Cricket Club records", "response": ["|align=left|1.\u00a0William Hickton2.\u00a0Johnny Briggs3.\u00a0Bob Berry"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1959", "response": ["The team included a considerable amount of fresh blood with Bob Berry Ian Buxton, Peter Eyre, Ian Hall, William Oates and William Richardson, all of whom had sustained careers with Derbyshire.

In 1949, Lomax moved on into occasional first-team matches, opening the bowling in his first first-class game against Oxford University, when he bowled 23 overs in the match for 31 runs (and two wickets). There were six first-class matches in 1949, nine in 1950 and eight in 1951; in none of them did he manage to take more than three wickets in an innings and nor did he make significant runs.

The team was drawn from non-Sheffield Shield players and most were too old to be counted as \"Colts\". In any case the cricket fans of Perth were uninterested and there was only a small crowd. Nevertheless, the game provided good practice for the MCC. The Colts captain Ian Dick won the toss and elected to bat, though in this case it would have probably made little difference to the result whether he batted first for second as they were dismissed for 103 by John Warr (4/33), Eric Hollies (3/30) and Bob Berry (2/24). David Sheppard (109) overtook this total with Reg Simpson (57) as they added 126 for the first wicket with Gilbert Parkhouse adding 79 before he retired hurt and Denis Compton stoking his way to 76. Brown declared on 369/4 and soon had the Colts reeling to Compton's slow left-arm wrist-spin (4/8) and Brown's own leg-spin (3/18).

South Australia were stronger than Western Australia, but rarely won the Sheffield Shield and fielded no Test players, though batsman Graeme Hole and wicket-keeper Gil Langley would later play for Australia. Len Hutton had by now recovered from his finger damaged in Colombo and was reunited with his old opening partner Cyril Washbrook. Washbrook had been an original choice for the team who had declined to tour before changing his mind and being flown out to join the party. Brown won the toss again and this time put the opposition in at the Adelaide Oval on what was by tradition a flat, lifeless wicket so that he could fully test his bowlers. Allen MacLean was out for 2, but the rest of the team batted solidly and Ron Hamence making 114 as Doug Wright (4/103) worked his way expensively through the batting and Brown took 3/55 in the absence of Alec Bedser. Bob Berry was put on and took 0/33 off 12 overs, which made Brown doubt his ability, leading him to be underused for the rest of the tour. When it was their return to bat the MCC bettered the home score by one run before Brown declared on 351/9 with nearly all the runs coming from Hutton (126) and Reg Simpson (119) adding 170 for the second wicket, Godfrey Evans reaching 38 and nobody else making 20. The game looked doom to a draw, but the South Australia captain Ridings declared on 185/3 after Dansie had made 64 to give the MCC a sporting chance of making 185 runs in 135 minutes. Hutton was out driving for 1, but Washbrook (63) and Simpson (69) rattled up 131 in just over an hour before Evans hit six successive balls to the boundary to give his team an undeserved 7 wicket win.pp45-50, Fingletonpp103-108, Kay", "Lindsay Hassett's Victoria was a tougher proposition, and they would win the Sheffield Shield for the 18th time that season. They also had the much vaunted \"mystery spin\" of Jack Iverson. Hassett as captain of both Victoria and Australia decided to play him against the England batsmen to see how they responded even though this might reveal his \"secret weapon\". Freddie Brown injured a finger and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional cricketer to captain the MCC for an entire game (Jack Hobbs took over during a match in 1924\u201325 when Arthur Gilligan was injured). Compton won the toss and made 107 on a good wicket with help from Len Hutton (32), Cyril Washbrook (40) and David Sheppard (28). Iverson was duly brought on and took the tailend wickets of Arthur Macintyre, John Warr and Bob Berry in his 3/85. Hassett noted that the recognised batsmen played him with due reverence and a high amount of concentration, and that he caused them trouble even though he did not threaten to take their wickets. Compton declared on 306/9 and saw the MCC total overtaken by Victoria over the course of the next two days thanks to Ron Howard (139) in his last first-class match with help from Test players Ian Johnson, (36), Doug Ring (70) and Bill Johnston (30) after Trevor Bailey (5/54) cheaply removed Ron Meuleman, Hassett, Neil Harvey, Sam Loxton and Eric Kerr. Their innings was interrupted for a day (7 November) for the Melbourne Cup, proving that \"everything stops for the Melbourne Cup\", or at least tour matches do. Victoria were all out for 331 on the last day and the MCC were left to bat out a pedestrian match with 79/4. Hassett was presumably satisfied with Iverson as he decided to hide him in the second innings and he did not bowl. The MCC for their part continued to live up to their billing as the worst fielding side to tour Australia.pp50-53, Fingletonpp109-114, Kay", "Travelling north from Sydney to Brisbane the MCC stopped for a couple of country matches, the first in the industrial town of Newcastle, New South Wales. Len Hutton and Denis Compton had already proved their form and were rested as Freddie Brown took charge again. The first day of the match was washed out and the wicket was turning into an unpredictable mud-heap by the time the teams got to play. The local captain was Bob Beatty who had played against the MCC in 1936\u201337 under Gubby Allen and 1946\u201357 under Wally Hammond and made 69 in his teams 169 as Eric Hollies took a flattering 5/39 and Bob Berry 4/45 on a real turner. The MCC provided more material to the Australian Press by collapsing to a fast bowler called John Bull, who took 6/24 with the help of some good catching and had the tourists 37/4. They reached 142 all out thanks to the pugnacious John Dewes who made 71, with nobody else making more than Reg Simpson's 23. To concede a 27 run first innings deficit to a club side was an embarrassment, but given the state of the pitch it was not as bad as some critics made out. On the \"sticky dogs\" and \"glue-pots\" produced by uncovered wickets only the best batsmen could hope to make runs against any competent bowling attack.pp56-57, Fingletonpp238-239, Kay", "The Australia XI match against the MCC used to be seen as virtually another Test match and important for the Australian selectors to see up and coming cricketers in action before choosing a team. For some reason in 1950\u201351 it was scheduled between the First and Second Tests and after the team for the latter had already been announced. Even if someone made a century or took ten wickets they could not be picked for the Australian team until the Third Test early in 1951, though Ken Archer and Jim Burke had been named in the XII and were fighting to avoid being the twelfth man. The game was held in Sydney as their rivals Melbourne were hosting two of the Tests. The Australian vice captain Arthur Morris was in charge on his home ground with local hero Keith Miller and the Victorian Neil Harvey who hardly needed testing. The batsmen Graeme Hole, wicket-keeper Gil Langley and bowlers Alan Walker, Geoff Noblet and Chris Langdon were also included, as was Ritchie Benaud, but he was too ill to play and was replaced by the veteran leg-spinner Doug Ring. Morris won the toss again and batted on a flat Sydney wicket, he added 170 with Ken Archer (81) before he was out for exactly 100, Harvey (40), Miller (62), Burke (128) and Hole (41) piled up the runs and Morris declared during the second day's tea interval for 526/9. John Warr (2/89) opened the bowling, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown failed to take a wicket and Eric Hollies (3/108) and Bob Berry (2/108 off just 14 overs) could not contain the attack. The two spinners could not blame the fielding as they each dropped Morris of their own bowling, and Berry dropping him off Hollies. Alan Walker (5/60) and Doug Ring (3/106) reduced the MCC's reply to 47/3 by stumps and it was up to Denis Compton (115) and nightwatchman Godfrey Evans (31) to restore the innings with a partnership of 85, followed by another of 130 between Compton and Gilbert Parkhouse (58). Burke added to his credentials be taking a great catch in gully to dismiss a tired Compton, leaving Brown to punch 46 before the tail gave way five runs short of saving the follow on. Morris sent the MCC back in to bat and saw them fall to 22/2 before John Dewes (66 not out) and Parkhouse (46 not out) saved the day. Dewes retired hurt at 66/2, but returned after Compton was dismissed for 29 and they ended on 173/3. Although Jim Burke made the most runs he carried the drinks in the Second Test and Archer opened with Morris, but Burke was chosen for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and made a century on debut. Langley proved to be a competent keeper, but failed to oust Don Tallon despite the latter's lack of form. The results for Freddie Brown were more dire, Compton's knee had swollen again due to his exertions and he was unfit to play at Melbourne, Berry and Hollies had proved incapable of containing the Australian batsmen and Bedser and Brown has lost the form which had caught Australia out at Brisbane. The only good news was that John Dewes had shown his fighting abilities regardless of form and a fair crowd had come to watch, so increasing coffers of the MCC Manager John Nash.pp100-102, Fingletonpp142-148, Kay", "Brian Statham and Roy Tattersall had just arrived from snowbound Lancashire and were thrown into this minor game to get their first cricket since September. They each took a wicket, but the honours belonged to the previously underperforming Bob Berry who returned figures of 6/36 as the South Australian team were shot out for 84. The real shock occurred when a blonde fast bowler called Lou Curtis \u2013 ironically from Berri, South Australia \u2013 took 5 wickets before stumps after David Sheppard (37) and Reg Simpson (30) added 60 for the first wicket. He continued the next day and took 9/60 despite Denis Compton making 40 and Freddie Brown a punchy 77 to take the MCC to 234 and a lead of 150. This proved to be enough as the Country XI were out for 124, the wickets shared around the team.
