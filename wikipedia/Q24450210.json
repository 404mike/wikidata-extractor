The third division team took the lead through Natasha Flint before the Hammers equalised on the stroke of half-time through Adriana Leon. Brianna Visalli put West Ham ahead after the break before Canadian international Leon scored her second goal of the game to secure a 3\u20131 victory. For the fifth round, West Ham were drawn at home to third division opposition for the second consecutive time in Huddersfield Town. The visitors once again took the lead as captain Kate Mallin buried a 14th minute penalty into the top corner but Alisha Lehmann leveled eight minutes later. By half-time, West Ham were leading 4\u20131 and scored another four in the second half including a hat-trick by Leanne Kiernan to eventually win out emphatic 8\u20131 victors. Jane Ross scored the only goal of a 1\u20130 quarter-final win over Championship side Aston Villa to send West Ham through to the team's semi\u2013final appearance. With only WSL teams left in the final four, West Ham finally met first division opposition for the first time in the competition as they traveled to Reading in the semi-finals. After a goalless first half, Rachel Furness put the home side ahead in the 49th minute. Just like in the fifth round, West Ham found an equaliser through Alisha Lehmann eight minutes later. With the teams locked at 1\u20131 after extra-time, the tie was eventually settled in a penalty shoot-out. 3\u20133 after five penalties each, the shoout-out entered sudden death: Anna Moorhouse saved Reading captain Jade Moore's weak attempt before South Korean international Cho So-hyun stepped up and stroked the ball into the top corner to book the Hammers' place at Wembley.
