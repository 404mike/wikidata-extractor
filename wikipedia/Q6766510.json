On his return, Westley stated he had come to \"finish the job he started\", referring to trying to guide the club into the Football League for the first time in its history. He said that \"the moment was right\" for him to come back into football and that he \"had some very good times at Stevenage before\". His appointment was met with scepticism by some Stevenage supporters, but Westley promised to deliver a winning team. Westley started by overhauling the squad in the summer transfer window and brought in 12 players. Among those brought in were Gary Mills and David Bridges, who Westley had managed during his time at Kettering. He also signed Michael Bostwick and Mark Albrighton, who he had also signed at Rushden & Diamonds. Westley also signed Andy Drury and Eddie Odhiambo respectively, both of whom were players Westley had previously earmarked."]}, {"page": "2008 Conference Premier play-off Final", "response": ["|CB ||6 ||Mark Albrighton"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Stevenage Borough F.C. season", "response": ["| Mark Albrighton", "As a result of a postponed league fixture at home to Barrow due to snow, which was originally scheduled to be played on 19 December, Borough did not play again in the league again until Boxing Day, away at Cambridge United. Despite going a goal behind early on, Stevenage won the match 3\u20131. A Danny Crow penalty in the sixth minute put the hosts in front after Mark Albrighton was deemed to have tugged Chris Holroyd's shirt in the box. Borough responded well and, twenty minutes later, earned a penalty of their own when Yemi Odubade was sliced down in the box. The striker dusted himself down and duly tucked away the spot-kick to draw the visitors level. A minute later, Cambridge were reduced to ten men, when Wayne Hatswell was sent-off for a two-footed lunge on Chris Beardsley. Stevenage took the lead ten minutes into the second-half when Charlie Griffin slotted home from an acute angle, before Chris Beardsley added a third with a neat finish after good work from Ronnie Henry. Two days later, the side drew 0\u20130 with AFC Wimbledon at Broadhall Way."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["Ahead of the club's first season in the Football League, Westley stated a desire to give the majority of the squad that had won promotion from the Conference National a chance to play in League Two. This subsequently meant there was a similar level of transfer activity to the club's 2009\u201310 campaign. Three players left the club ahead of the 2010\u201311 season. Andy Drury decided to leave Stevenage in favour of a move back into non-league, joining Luton Town on a free transfer, while both Mark Albrighton and Eddie Odhiambo were released in June 2010. Five players joined the club during the close season. Darius Charles was the first signing of the season, joining Stevenage from Ebbsfleet United for a fee set by a tribunal. Wingers Peter Winn and Rob Sinclair signed on free transfers from Scunthorpe United and Salisbury City respectively, while defender Luke Foster joined the club after being released by Mansfield Town. Stevenage also announced the signing of midfielder John Mousinho in late June 2010, who rejected a contract extension at Wycombe Wanderers in order to sign for the club. In terms of transfers during the 2010\u201311 campaign, strikers Lee Boylan, Tim Sills and Peter Vincenti were all allowed to find new clubs in January 2011,", "|DF|| Mark Albrighton || Kidderminster Harriers || Released || 14 June 2010 ||"]}, {"page": "2009 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|DF ||6 || Mark Albrighton"]}, {"page": "Albrighton (surname)", "response": ["*Mark Albrighton (born 1976), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Albrighton, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Albrighton"]}]}}
