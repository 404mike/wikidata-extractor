His notable works include Morris Telford - A Salopian Odyssey weblog for the BBC and subsequent novel, Marlowe Bidforth's Backpack Adventure, and the Prism award-winning American Spoon Indigo. He collaborated with screenwriter Philip Railsback on a number of screenplays. Famous in writing circles for using a staggering number of pseudonyms, he argues that this helps keep his work fresh, ensures the writing stands on its own merit rather than his reputation and \"irritates my publicist so much that it's become a self-destructive habit I can't give up\". He is also the co-founder along with Darrell Till of the media production company Tiny Lapel.\nThe music video \"Sell Out Story\" for the band \"The Ohms\" was animated and directed by him as a favour for a friend and went on to win the \"2004 Mill Award for new media Animation\".He has recently been appearing at comicbook conventions in the UK giving talks on Jack Kirby and representing the Jack Kirby Museum.His digital artwork was used in December 2014 as part of the 'On Creating Reality, by Andy Kaufman' exhibition at the London Frieze.His writing influences include Douglas Adams, Ray Bradbury, Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Robert Rankin, J. R. R. Tolkien, Gene Wolfe, Roger Zelazny, Kurt Vonnegut, and Jack Kirby", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darrell Till", "response": ["He is also co-founder of the comedy duo Tiny Lapel along with Russell Payne."]}, {"page": "Payne (name)", "response": ["*Russell Payne (author), English writer and artist"]}, {"page": "Russell Payne", "response": ["Russell Payne may refer to:", "*Russell Payne (soccer) (born 1975), retired American soccer goalkeeper", "*Russell Payne (author) (born 1971), English author", "*Russell Payne (athlete) (1902\u20131970), American Olympic athlete"]}, {"page": "List of people from Blackpool", "response": ["*Russell Payne (born 1971), writer"]}]}}
