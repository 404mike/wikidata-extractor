He was a longtime fixture on the London jazz scene and was an early influence on British bebop.Rose played with Johnny Claes in the 1940s, but dodged conscription during World War II and did little performing over the course of the war. He worked with Cab Kaye's Ministers of Swing late in 1948, then organized jam sessions with British musicians such as Ronnie Scott in the late 1940s and early 1950s, many of which took place at Club Eleven. Rose recorded very little, though he did a session with Scott in 1949 for Esquire Records. He continued to perform locally in London for several decades, and recorded with Maggie Nicols in the early 1970s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British jazz", "response": ["In 1948, a group of young musicians including John Dankworth and Ronnie Scott, focused on the Club Eleven in London, began a movement toward \"modern jazz\" or Bebop. Significant instrumentalists in this early movement were trumpeter-pianist Denis Rose, pianist Tommy Pollard, saxophonist Don Rendell, and drummers Tony Kinsey and Laurie Morgan. A movement in an opposite direction was revivalism, which became popular in the 1950s and was represented by musicians like George Webb, Humphrey Lyttelton and Ken Colyer, although Lyttelton gradually became more catholic in his approach. Trad jazz, a variant, briefly entered the pop charts later. At this point both streams tended to emulate Americans, whether it be Charlie Parker for Beboppers or Joe \"King\" Oliver and other New Orleans musicians for traditionalists, rather than try to create a uniquely British form of jazz."]}, {"page": "Tony Crombie", "response": ["Born into London's East End Jewish community, Crombie was a self-taught musician who began playing the drums at the age of fourteen. He was one of a group of young men from the East End of London who ultimately formed the co-operative Club Eleven, bringing modern jazz to Britain. Having gone to New York with his friend Ronnie Scott in 1947, witnessing the playing of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, he and like-minded musicians such as Johnny Dankworth, and Scott and Denis Rose, brought be-bop to the UK. This group of musicians were the ones called upon if and when modern jazz gigs were available."]}, {"page": "Kathy Stobart", "response": ["In 1942, aged 17, she moved to London, playing with Denis Rose, Ted Heath and Jimmy Skidmore. Later that decade she played with Art Pepper and Peanuts Hucko. She played with Canadian pianist Art Thompson (1918-2003) whom she joined in 1943, and was married to him from 1943-1951. He led the band at London's Embassy Club, then a favourite London haunt for visiting stars such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope."]}, {"page": "Denis rose", "response": ["#REDIRECT Denis Rose "]}, {"page": "Cab Kaye", "response": ["From 1948 he performed mainly as leader of his bands, such as the Ministers of Swing with saxophonists Ronnie Scott and Johnny Dankworth and pianist Denis Rose. For the new wave of London musicians from the West Indies, as well as English musicians, Kaye was an inspiration as band leader. In 1949 he played with Tommy Pollard (piano, accordion, vibes), Cecil Jacob \"Flash\" Winston (drums, vocals and piano) and Paul Fenhoulet's Orchestra. On 13 October 1949 Kaye recorded with clarinettist Keith Bird and The Esquire Six."]}, {"page": "Club Eleven", "response": ["The club was so named because it had 11 founders \u2013 business manager Harry Morris and ten British bebop musicians. It first opened at 41 Great Windmill Street in Soho in 1948, and had two house bands, one led by Ronnie Scott and the other by John Dankworth. Scott's sidemen included Tony Crombie, Lennie Bush, Tommy Pollard, and Hank Shaw, while Dankworth's included Leon Calvert, Bernie Fenton, Joe Muddell, and Laurie Morgan. When Scott toured the US, Don Rendell filled his spot. Denis Rose organised many of the activities at the club."]}, {"page": "Dennis Rose", "response": ["#REDIRECT Denis Rose"]}]}}
