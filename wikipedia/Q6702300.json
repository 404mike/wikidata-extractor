Brett Hodgson gave Huddersfield the initiative by kicking a penalty for a 0\u20132 lead, and Hock almost responded but knocked-on in the act of scoring a try. Bailey eventually scored a try for Wigan, but Richards failed to convert, and the score was made level after another kicked penalty from Brett Hodgson. Scott Moore gave Huddersfield the lead again after a run from dummy half to give a 4\u201310 lead, despite a take-out on Leuluai just before half-time which went unpenalised. Luke Robinson was sin-binned for delaying play and Roberts almost made the advantage count, but grounded the ball in touch and the try was disallowed. Darrell Griffin and Hansen were then sin-binned for a fight, before passing along the backs lead to a Roberts try, but Richards again failed to convert.
