On 14 October he was in the stands to see his new side draw 3\u20133 with Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road, presided over by caretaker manager Martin Hunter. Grant opted to retain Hunter as a coach, but also appointed a new assistant manager, Jim Duffy. Hunter eventually left the club in the summer of 2007 to take up a coaching position at Watford. Grant's first signing for Norwich was Jamie Ashdown from Portsmouth on a one-month loan. Grant generally made a good start to his managerial career only losing 2 league games out of his first 6 although this was a heavy 5\u20130 defeat to Stoke and a defeat to local rivals Ipswich. They did get wins against high flying teams such as Birmingham and Cardiff. Norwich only won once in the league in December and January, which put them within three points off the relegation zone at one point. Consecutive away wins at relegation rivals Barnsley and Luton Town all but ended any risk of relegation, and City finished the season in 16th place."]}, {"page": "History of Norwich City F.C.", "response": ["The club was expected to make a quick return to the Premiership in the 2005\u201306 season, but a terrible first four months to the campaign saw City fall as low as 18th in The Championship and \"the fans started to turn on Nigel Worthington\". Dean Ashton was sold for a club-record \u00a37million, approximately double what they had paid just one year earlier. Half of Ashton's fee was immediately reinvested in the purchase of Welsh striker Robert Earnshaw, who helped the Canaries' revival to a ninth-place finish. Worthington made just one permanent signing in the close season, and when a poor run of form ensued, leaving the club in 17th place in the Championship, he was dismissed. First team coach Martin Hunter acted as caretaker manager for a fortnight before former City player Peter Grant left West Ham United to become the new manager."]}, {"page": "Brian Eastick", "response": ["In May 2005 he was appointed assistant to Don Givens as manager of the Republic of Ireland under-21 team. In August of the same year, Eastick was appointed a national coach with the FA and took responsibility for the England under-18 side. When Martin Hunter stepped down in June 2006 to take up a role as first-team coach with Norwich City, Eastick stepped up to take charge of the under-19s.
