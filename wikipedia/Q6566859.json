John Collins in 1676 named the special case, of rational approximations to \u03c0, after Davenant; and Wallis praised him. Jackie Stedall suggests, however, that Wallis was more concerned with misdirection, resisting the attribution of earlier work in the field to John Pell. Another usage of \"Dr. Davenant's problem\" was to an unrelated question in elimination theory. This latter problem was addressed by Isaac Newton using power series, and is documented in correspondence."]}, {"page": "Jacqueline Anne Stedall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jackie Stedall "]}, {"page": "Jacqueline Stedall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jackie Stedall "]}, {"page": "Janet Beery", "response": ["With Jackie Stedall, Beery is the editor of Thomas Harriot\u2019s Doctrine of Triangular Numbers: the 'Magisteria Magna' (European Mathematical Society, 2009).
