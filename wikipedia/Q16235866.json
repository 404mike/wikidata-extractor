On 23 August 2012 he signed for League Two club Barnet. He was sent off in a 2\u20131 defeat against Fleetwood Town on 29 September. He was eventually handed the captaincy in the absence of both Edgar Davids and Barry Fuller (who was vice-captain). After a string of excellent performances, in January 2013, he was given a three-year contract extension until June 2016. He saved a 94th minute penalty in the last ever game at Underhill Stadium, a 1\u20130 win against Wycombe Wanderers on 20 April 2013. Stack started the game against Northampton in the final game of the season, which they went on to lose 2\u20130, thus relegating Barnet to the Conference. In the 2013\u201314 season, Stack became team captain after Edgar Davids' resignation. Stack won promotion with the Bees by winning the Conference title of 2014\u201315 with the bees. He lost his place to Jamie Stephens in the 2015\u201316 season, and left the club in July 2016 despite being offered a new deal."]}, {"page": "Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)", "response": ["The following 2009\u201310 play-off season saw Wilson and club chairman Andrew Fitton forge many relationships with Premier League and SPL sides, most notably Liverpool, Manchester City and Celtic, who all loaned Wilson players to aid his development of the squad. Wilson released youth team goalkeeper Jamie Stephens to the Liverpool youth academy, who in turn loaned Swindon Stephen Darby, who later scored the winning penalty that put Swindon through to the 2009\u201310 play-off final. Simon Ferry and Paul Caddis were loaned from Celtic, both having since been signed on permanent deals from the club. Wilson loaned Manchester City striker David Ball for the 2010\u201311 season.
