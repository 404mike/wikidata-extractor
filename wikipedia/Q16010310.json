He learned to play cornet and trumpet in his youth and joined a Salvation Army band. He fought with the RAAF in World War II, being injured and losing an eye in New Guinea.  After the war he played with local groups in Canberra and Sydney, as well as working as a finance officer, and in the mid-1950s he moved to Wollongong where he built a small recording studio in his house.  In 1961 he recorded a local group, the Del-Fi's, whose recordings had some success, and in 1965 he moved to Hurstville, Sydney and set up a new studio behind a butcher's shop.Record releases by the Bee Gees in Australia had been relatively unsuccessful commercially at that time, but Byrne was a fan and, in 1966, offered the group almost unlimited recording time to develop their sound.  He also became the group's co-manager.  At the same time, he worked as producer with successful Australian pop singer Ronnie Burns.  In November 1966 the Bee Gees had their first major success, \"Spicks and Specks\".  The group decided to develop their career in England, and Byrne accompanied them.  Arriving in England in February 1967, the group immediately won a recording contract with Robert Stigwood, and Byrne recorded the single \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" with them at the IBC Studios in Portland Place.  It became a hit in the UK, and internationally, and Byrne then produced the group's album, Bee Gees' 1st (although the group had released two albums previously in Australia).After that album, Byrne did not work with the Bee Gees again, as the group developed their own independent skills.  Byrne remained in London, and produced the only album by folk rock band Eclection in 1968, and the first album by progressive rock band Cressida in 1969.Byrne opened a studio called Village Way recorders in Rayners Lane in Harrow North London which he owned till his death at which time he left it in his will to Paul Layton of the New Seekers.  When he went into hospital for his last illness, the studio called in engineer/producer Paul \"Doc\" Stewart to keep the studio running.  Stewart in turn, with the help of Roy Williams of Nervous Records and Steve Rispin made Village way the leading centre for Neo rockabilly and psychobilly until Ozzie's death at which point they moved to Tin Pan Alley studios in Denmark Street. Byrne died in London in 1983, of cancer.  The Bee Gees dedicated their 1987 album, E.S.P., to his memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bee Gees", "response": ["A minor hit in 1965, \"Wine and Women\", led to the group's first LP, The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. By 1966 Festival Records was, however, on the verge of dropping them from the Leedon roster because of their perceived lack of commercial success. At this time the brothers met the American-born songwriter, producer and entrepreneur Nat Kipner, who had just been appointed A&R manager of a new independent label, Spin Records. Kipner briefly took over as the group's manager and successfully negotiated their transfer to Spin in exchange for granting Festival the Australian distribution-rights to the group's recordings. Through Kipner the Bee Gees met engineer-producer, Ossie Byrne, who produced (or co-produced with Kipner) many of the earlier Spin recordings, most of which were cut at his own small, self-built St Clair Studio in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville. Byrne gave the Gibb brothers virtually unlimited access to St Clair Studio over a period of several months in mid-1966. The group later acknowledged that this enabled them to greatly improve their skills as recording artists. During this productive time they recorded a large batch of original material\u2014including the song that became their first major hit, \"Spicks and Specks\" (on which Byrne played the trumpet coda)\u2014as well as cover versions of current hits by overseas acts such as the Beatles. They regularly collaborated with other local musicians, including members of beat band Steve & The Board, led by Steve Kipner, Nat's teenage son.", "Frustrated by their lack of success, the Gibbs began their return journey to England on 4 January 1967, with Ossie Byrne travelling with them. While at sea in January 1967, the Gibbs learned that Go-Set, Australia's most popular and influential music newspaper, had declared \"Spicks and Specks\" the \"Best Single of the Year\"."]}, {"page": "Eclection", "response": ["The group then added drummer Gerry Conway, a member of Alexis Korner's backing group.  Despite their backgrounds, the band regarded themselves as being a \"progressive rock\" group rather than playing \"folk rock\", a term which had not yet come into widespread use.  They began recording at IBC Studios in London in December 1967, with Australian record producer Ossie Byrne and arranger Phil Dennys, who had both worked on The Bee Gees' first hit \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\".  The songs were recorded as rehearsed, with vocal harmonies and ornate orchestral arrangements overdubbed later.  The band released their first single, \"Nevertheless\", written by Rosen, in June 1968; it received some airplay in the UK but did not chart.  They also appeared on Dutch TV, BBC radio, and the BBC TV show Colour Me Pop."]}, {"page": "Spicks and Specks (album)", "response": ["Nat Kipner brought the Bee Gees to St. Clair Studio, Hurstville (in Sydney's southern suburbs). It was a small place behind a butcher's shop in a strip shopping centre, owned and operated by Kipner's friend Ossie Byrne, a sound engineer who was working wonders with even more modest facilities than Festival Studios. Both Kipner and Barry Gibb recall that the recording equipment was just two one-track tape decks and a mixer. But many Festival acts would make the trip to Hurstville to get the benefit of Byrne's talents and the more relaxed artist-oriented atmosphere. Among them was the band Steve and the Board, led by Kipner's son, Steve Kipner, all of whom became friends with the Bee Gees because both groups were allowed the run of the studio whenever it was not booked for other performers. The Bee Gees had never had much studio time before.

We decided after some discussion on a name taken from the William Shakespeare play Troilus and Cressida.\" Their first gigs as Cressida were in Germany, including the Star-Club in Hamburg sharing the bill with Colosseum and East Of Eden, in the Autumn of 1969. Their manager at the time, Mike Rosen, also drove their Transit van and, being a trumpet player (he later joined Mogul Thrash), occasionally joined the band on stage for some of their more extended numbers.

It was produced by Ossie Byrne with their manager Robert Stigwood as executive producer. The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album, Bee Gees' 1st.

During mid-1966 Kipner collaborated with independent producer Ossie Byrne on the short-lived Downunder Records. During this period he briefly took over the management of The Bee Gees and persuaded Festival's Leedon label to release the band from their contract and signed them to the newly established Spin Records, which he had just joined as A&R manager. Following Kipner's departure, Pat Aulton took over as Sunshine's main producer, but both he and Kipner also produced recordings on Sunshine's short-lived sister label Kommotion, which was set up to promote the acts who appeared on the TV pop show of the same name.
