She  worked with the Ashendene Press, the writer Olive Schreiner, and the archaeologist Flinders Petrie, among others. She is considered a leading illuminator of the British Arts and Crafts movement, with one authority holding that her originality as an illuminator was greater even than that of William Morris. She also designed some sets and costumes for opera and ballet.", "link_mentions": []}}
