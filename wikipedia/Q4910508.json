Iliffe was also invited to compete at the World's Strongest Man finals in consecutive years. Iliffe's career was affected in 2002 by a split disc in his back that had caused weakness in his legs. However, surgery to correct the injury looked very positive. On his personal website he said: \"I have now had an MRI scan and the bottom disk in my back is split, so I go into the woodlands private Hospital in Kettering on the 22nd of October to  surgery to fix the problem, so I will be back fighting fit very soon and will be at BSM 2003 to hopefully win title for a second time. Can't wait to get it sorted as it has caused problems the last few months,and will be back in training very soon the surgeon . It should not cause me any more problems and is near enough an instant fix, and leg pain and weakness will be gone instantly.\"\"Marc's Back Injury\", News on RawMuscle.com"]}, {"page": "World Muscle Power Classic", "response": ["|1999 ||  Hugo Girard ||colspan=2 align=center |  Mark Philippi /  Raimonds BergmanisTuesday, August 3, 1999, Philippi Second Place in World Musclepower... by Randall J.
