A scene where a cat escaped during Zoe's operation to bug Kane's cottage, and the ensuing search in the rain mirrored an experience during Wolstencroft's early career. It was also intended that the episode established that although spies plan heavily before operations, things can go wrong. Among the main cast, Peter Firth was attracted to appearing on Spooks after hearing of Howard Brenton's involvement in the series. The cast were advised by ex-MI5 officers in order to help give insight into how the characters operate in the spy world and how their personal lives would be affected by it. The character Maisie Simm (Heather Cave), Ellie's daughter, was created because Featherstone believed that \"children are the best spies of all\"; Maisie is often seen \"spying\" on Tom throughout the episode and first series.

Keeley Hawes plays junior case officer Zoe Reynolds. Hawes was attracted to the parallels between acting and spying. The actress described Zoe as \"a feisty little number.

Wolstencroft was influenced by American television to make the episodes pacier. His chosen writing style was a mixture of the \"grittyness\" of le Carr\u00e9's works and James Bond-like fantasies. While writing the series, the writer introduced a set of \"MI5 terminology\", terms used by the main characters in the series. According to Oyelowo, Wolstencroft's scripts included more spy terms, stating \"we curse David Wolstencroft often. His dialogue tends to be the most chewy,\" and the actors had to learn them as if they spoke as such on a daily basis. Brenton, meanwhile, adopted the same writing style based on early episodes of Taggart, a Scottish-based crime drama; the writer was impressed by the show's ability to add more to the plot halfway through. He also took inspirations from novels including le Carr\u00e9's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Mirren wrote \"One Last Dance\", which he felt was difficult to write as he had to tie two main storylines together. Brenton and Wolstencroft collaborated to write \"Lesser of Two Evils\" due to timing constraints. Wolstencroft pitched the story, and then each writer wrote 30 pages of dialogue.", " Colin Green was nominated for his editing work, and Jennie Muskett for Original Television Music in the Craft awards, but lost to Daniel Deronda and The Forsyte Saga respectively.

He included characters, such as innocent Muslims who opposed the Islamic extremists, as well as a \"Muslim hero\" who would thwart the terrorists. The writer still wrote \"Nest of Angels\" as a classic spy story, where an operative goes undercover to subvert a villainous operation. Director Bharat Nalluri felt that making the hero a Muslim exemplified the balanced view.
