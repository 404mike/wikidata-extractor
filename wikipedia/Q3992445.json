He is known for having discovered a record number of supernovae. The main-belt asteroid 7648 Tomboles is named in his honor.He was President of the British Astronomical Association from 2003 to 2005 and Vice President from 2005 to 2007. He is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and an Examinations Moderator in astronomy with the International Baccalaureate. At the International Astronomical Union, he was a member of Division VIII Galaxies & the Universe and \"Commission 28\" until 2012 and 2015, respectively, and is currently a member of IAU's division C and J (Education, Outreach and Heritage; Galaxies and Cosmology).Boles has co-authored three text books on popular astronomy and has published numerous articles in Astronomy Now, Sky and Telescope; the Austrian The Star Observer, the Journal of the British Astronomical Association, and in the journal The Astronomer. In 2007 he co-authored a research paper about a \"giant outburst two years before the core-collapse of a massive star\" in the journal Nature.Boles holds a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from the Open University. He held director level appointments over a period of 18 years with four multinational computer companies. He retired in 2001 to dedicate himself to astronomy work and to help with the public Outreach of astronomy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Astronomical Association", "response": ["The BAA continues to contribute to the science of astronomy, even despite modern competition from space-based telescopes and highly automated professional observatories. Modern digital sensors, coupled with techniques such as lucky imaging, mean that even modest amateur equipment can rival what professional observatories could have achieved a few decades ago. The vastness of the night sky, together with the sheer number of amateur observatories, mean that BAA members are often the first to pick up new phenomena. In recent years, the Association's leading supernova hunter, Tom Boles (President 2003\u20135), has discovered over 150 supernovae. He now holds the world record for the greatest number of such events discovered by any individual in history."]}, {"page": "Meanings of minor planet names: 84001\u201385000", "response": ["| 84417 Ritabo ||  || Rita Boles, wife of Scottish amateur astronomer and discoverer of this minor planet, Tom Boles || "]}, {"page": "7648 Tomboles", "response": ["7648 Tomboles, provisional designation , is a background asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately  in diameter.
