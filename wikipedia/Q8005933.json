Italian anatomical pathologist Giovanni Battista Morgagni further described the characteristics of gastric inflammation.

Between 1808 and 1831, French physician Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph-Victor Broussais gathered information from the autopsy of the dead French soldiers. He described chronic gastritis as \"Gastritide\" and erroneously believed that gastritis was the cause of ascites, typhoid fever, and meningitis. In 1854, Charles Handfield Jones and Wilson Fox described the microscopic changes of stomach inner lining in gastritis which existed in diffuse and segmental forms. In 1855, Baron Carl von Rokitansky first described hypertrophic gastritis. In 1859, British physician, William Brinton first described about acute, subacute, and chronic gastritis. In 1870, Samuel Fenwick noted that pernicious anemia causes glandular atrophy in gastritis. German surgeon, Georg Ernst Konjetzny noticed that gastric ulcer and gastric cancer are the results of gastric inflammation. Shields Warren and Willam A. Meissner described the intestinal metaplasia of the stomach as a feature of chronic gastritis."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*William Brinton - physician"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| William Brinton||02/06/1864||20 November 1823 \u2013 17 January 1867"]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* William Brinton (1823\u20131867)"]}, {"page": "Brinton, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Brinton"]}]}}
