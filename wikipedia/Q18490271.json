Garnett was educated at Addiscombe Military Seminary, where he obtained his first commission in 1846, and proceeded to India in 1848 as a lieutenant of the Bengal Engineers. He was appointed assistant field engineer with the army before the conflict at Mooltan, and wounded while in attendance with Sir John Cheape reconnoitering the breaches, but was able to take charge of the scaling-ladders in the subsequent assault. He joined the army under Lord Gough, held the fords of the Chen\u00e2b during the victory at the Battle of Gujrat, and went forward with Sir Walter Raleigh Gilbert's flying column in pursuit of the Afghans. Having taken part in the first survey of the Peshaw\u00fbr valley with Lieutenant James Walker (afterwards surveyor-general of India), he was next engaged on public works at Koh\u00e2t, where in 1850 the sappers employed under his command in making a road to the Kothul were surprised in their camp by the Afridis. Garnett and Sir F. R. Pollock (then Lieutenant), who was also stationed at Koh\u00e2t, were surrounded, but held their position until the arrival of a relieving force from Peshaw\u00fbr under Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde, accompanied by General Charles J. Napier, by whom the Koh\u00e2t pass was forced."]}, {"page": "Sir John Cheape", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Cheape"]}, {"page": "1838 Coronation Honours", "response": ["*Lieutenant-Colonel John Cheape, of the Bengal Engineers"]}, {"page": "Cheape", "response": ["* John Cheape (1792\u20131875), Scottish general"]}, {"page": "Cheape, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Cheape"]}]}}
