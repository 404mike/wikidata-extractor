His parents were computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975.  A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. He studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in physics. While at university, Berners-Lee made a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop."]}, {"page": "Ferranti Mark 1", "response": ["Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods, the parents of Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, both worked on the Ferranti Mark\u00a01 and Mark\u00a01*."]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 September \u2013 Conway Berners-Lee, mathematician and computer scientist (died 2019)"]}, {"page": "Science and invention in Birmingham", "response": ["Conway Berners-Lee, a mathematician and computer scientist from Birmingham, works in the team that develops the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial stored program electronic computer.

Hugh McGregor Ross records that \"George Felton tells how, when Pegasus was new, he would borrow a front door key on Friday evenings so he could get in during the weekends. Then, alone in the building, he would start up the computer to sum a series to calculate the value of \u03c0 to a then record 10,024 decimal places. This was a good test of the reliability of Pegasus\". His computations of \u03c0 were records in their day 1957.
