LeoI sent his niece, Philippa, to Nicaea, and Theodore married her at Christmas 1214. Historian Michael Angold proposes that Pope InnocentIII promoted a marriage alliance between Theodore and Leo to secure Theodore's support in his conflict with Emperor Henry during the War of the Antiochene Succession. Theodore repudiated Philippa for an unknown reason and disinherited her son. According to Angold, Theodore was informed only after the marriage that his wife was not Leo's daughter. Her son must have been born in 1214, because he was not yet eight years old when Theodore died. Theodore's third wife, Maria of Courtenay, was the daughter of Yolanda of Flanders and Peter\u00a0II of Courtenay. Theodore married Maria in the hope of intervening in the administration of the Latin Empire late in 1218 or early in 1219."]}, {"page": "Theodore II Laskaris", "response": ["Theodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\", without naming his opponents, in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254. Historian Michael Angold proposes that Emperor Frederick\u00a0II's similar policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\". Theodore appointed George Mouzalon to be the commander-in-chief of the mobile army as the new megas domestikos. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new protovestiarites (commander of the guards of the imperial palace). Theodore also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, Constantine Margarites. He also tried to compensate the aristocrats who had been put aside during this father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals. His appointments offended most aristocrats."]}, {"page": "Index of Byzantine Empire\u2013related articles", "response": ["* Michael Angold"]}, {"page": "Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty", "response": ["*Michael Angold, The Byzantine Empire 1025\u20131204, Longman, Harlow Essex (1984)."]}]}}
