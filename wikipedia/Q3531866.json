He worked with director Paul McGuigan to establish the look of the show in the first two episodes, with Coker hiring McGuigan based on his direction of the Sherlock episode \"A Scandal in Belgravia\". Coker was delighted to learn how little CGI McGuigan used to craft the visuals of that episode, and wanted the same approach for Luke Cage, \"just old school camera stuff. He brought a very analogue perspective, analogue feel to the show.\" McGuigan, Coker explained, directed \"every scene [as] long takes, from multiple takes over and over again. We would run an entire eight-page scene almost like a play, so when it comes together it's seamless.\" McGuigan was inspired by the works of photographers Gordon Parks, Tony Ray-Jones, and Jack Garofalo. Billeter looked to differentiate the look of Luke Cage from Jessica Jones, using modified gels on lights, and saturating and warming colors in color correction to give Harlem a more glowing look. Coker noted that the series' has a color scheme of yellow, brown, amber, and gold, in contrast to the violet tint Billeter gave Jessica Jones to reflect that series' villain, the Purple Man. The series was shot on Netflix's standard 4K cameras, with Billeter pairing them with Panavision Primo lenses that were \"custom treated with a reflective coating in between the glass elements in the interior of the lens, causing more flares and bringing down the contrast in addition to very slightly de-focusing them\" in order to \"add something magic, less controlled and more cinematic\". Billeter filmed Colter with a lot of low angles to make him look \"even more heroic\", and kept the camera close to him with Harlem in the background so that Cage \"is always the dominant force in his shots, but he also remains a part of the terrain. The shots aren't of him alone; they\u2019re of him in his home.\""]}, {"page": "Camera Owner", "response": ["Colin Osman, himself a keen photographer, historian and collector of photography, and owner of Coo Press, a publishing house with a long and lucrative history of racing pigeon publications, bought the failing Camera Owner from the publishers Davpet Ltd. for \u00a31 in 1966.Colin Ford.
