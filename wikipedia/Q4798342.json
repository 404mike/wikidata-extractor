He helped many people by building the Dowleswaram Barrage (Rajamahendravaram), the Prakasam Barrage and the Kurnool Cuddappah Canal (K. C. Canal). His dream was only partially realised, but he is still honoured in parts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for his efforts. The Sir Arthur Cotton Museum has been built in his honour in Rajamahendravaram, Andhra Pradesh. The museum holds approximately one hundred images and 15 machine tools that Cotton used when constructing the barrage in Andhra Pradesh from 1847 to 1852.\nHe entered the Madras Engineers in 1819 and fought in the First Burmese War. He was knighted in 1861. \nAn evangelist, he was the father of fellow evangelist Elizabeth Hope.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
