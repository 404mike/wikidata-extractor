Due to the calibre of his performance, the Spanish media nicknamed Forster \"La Gran Muralla\" (\"The Great Wall\"). Forster continued to impress in domestic matches as well. In January 2013, Motherwell were awarded a soft penalty against Celtic. Bizarrely, referee Steven McLean allowed Tom Hateley to take the penalty kick from in front of the penalty spot. Forster was yellow carded for his protests to McLean, but the goalkeeper went on to produce an excellent one-handed save high to his right. The following month in a league match against Dundee, Forster tipped over a powerful Gary Harkins dipping shot at full-stretch. This save was voted the SPL Save of the Season in May 2013. Forster went to win a second league title with Celtic that season, and completed a league and cup double on 26 May 2013 with a 3\u20130 win over Hibernian in the Scottish Cup Final."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["|  Tom Hateley", "|Tom Hateley", "||| MF|| 24 ||Tom Hateley"]}, {"page": "Hateley", "response": ["*Tom Hateley (born 1989), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["|Tom Hateley", "||| MF|| 6 ||Tom Hateley"]}, {"page": "Motherwell F.C. 6\u20136 Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["Hibs raced into a 4\u20131 lead in the first half, largely thanks to a hat-trick by Colin Nish. Giles Coke had equalised for Motherwell after Nish opened the scoring, but had then gifted Hibs their third goal, scored by Derek Riordan. Motherwell did pull a goal back before half-time through John Sutton, but two goals by Anthony Stokes after the restart seemingly put the game beyond doubt at 6\u20132. Within 15 minutes, however, Motherwell had reduced the deficit to 6\u20135, thanks to a simple tap-in by Coke, a Tom Hateley free kick and a Sutton header from close range. Substitute Ross Forbes then had the chance to equalise from a penalty kick with three minutes left, but it was saved by Graeme Smith, who had conceded the penalty in the first place. Forbes had taken the penalty despite the fact that Lukas Jutkiewicz was the nominated penalty taker; Jutkiewicz had deferred to Forbes as he was fresher, having only come on less than 10 minutes previously. In the third minute of injury time, Jutkiewicz produced a remarkable effort to score the equaliser, a goal that his manager Craig Brown compared to Marco van Basten's goal in the 1988 European Championship Final.", "|CM ||24 || Tom Hateley || "]}, {"page": "2011 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||6 || Tom Hateley"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Scottish Premier League", "response": ["| Tom Hateley"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dunfermline Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["Both teams went into this match after an excellent start to the season, both surpassing expectations. From the start the visitors looked like they would get goals with Dunfermline's defence being torn apart, especially by a lively Chris Humphrey. The breakthrough finally came when Keith Lasley and Michael Higdon combined with Higdon curling in from the edge of the area. Tom Hateley nearly made it two a few minutes later with a free-kick hitting the post. But it was only a short respite for Dunfermline as Motherwell scored again, Jamie Murphy strolled past Gary Mason and was given time to hit a 20-yard shot which heavily deflected off Alex Keddie and into the net. In the second half things hadn't changed with Motherwell dominating and when Chris Humphrey was allowed to cut inside into the box his shot clipped the post and into the net. Dunfermline then started to attack, pushing Motherwell back, and were rewarded when David Graham's 25-yard shot flicked off Joe Cardle and into the net, with Cardle claiming the goal. Cardle then bagged another as he cut into the box and his shot deflected off Stephen Craigan and past the helpless keeper. With two minutes to go Dunfermline pushed forward, but were counter-attacked and Higdon's late finish from a cross by Nicky Law finished the game.
