He was born at Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England.\nWilson played 171 first-class matches for Lancashire over 15 seasons, but was intermittently throughout his career superseded by other wicketkeepers who were generally better batsmen: Alfred Barlow in 1950, Frank Parr in 1953 and John Jordan in 1956. He was finally supplanted by Geoff Clayton in 1959 but returned for a single game in 1962 when he was granted a benefit to reward his loyalty.", "link_mentions": {}}}
