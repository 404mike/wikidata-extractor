On discharge, he returned to Lancashire and was brought into the first team at the start of June 1959, remaining then as first-choice wicketkeeper until he left the county at the end of the 1964 season. In his first innings for the county side, he top-scored with 43. In his third County Championship match, against Middlesex at Liverpool, he scored an unbeaten 74. The batting was a bonus: Lancashire's previous first-choice wicketkeeper, Alan Wilson, had a career batting average of less than six runs per innings. But Clayton in his first full season averaged more than 24, and though he did not sustain this, and the 74* remained his highest score until 1963, he batted for most of his career at No 7 or No 8. Clayton's arrival was noted by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack's 1960 edition: \"In the sturdily built Clayton, Lancashire discovered a wicketkeeper of real promise and lively character,\" it wrote."]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Alan Wilson, 94, cricketer (Lancashire County Cricket Club)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2015", "response": ["*Alan Wilson, 94, English cricketer (Lancashire).Alan Wilson Obituary"]}]}}
