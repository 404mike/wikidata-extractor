In 1881 he built a range of offices, shops and warehouses at the junction of Cannon Street and Cherry Street in Birmingham whose Queen Anne revival style marked one of the first signs of the new simplicity in Birmingham architecture that would emerge with the Arts and Crafts movement, in reaction against the heavily decorated terracotta style then prevalent. During the early 1880s, he trained Robert England from Christchurch in New Zealand; England would become a prominent architect in his home town.During the 1890s Ball emerged as one of the leading domestic architects in England and fully absorbed the influence of the Arts and Crafts movement, designing a series of one-off houses that gradually abandoned his earlier classical influences, culminating in the exceptional simplicity of the semi detached pair of houses he built for himself at 17 and 19 Rotton Park Road in Edgbaston.In 1899 Ball collaborated with William Lethaby on 122\u2013124 Colmore Row in central Birmingham, whose break with revivalism makes it a building of European importance. In 1904 he completed Winterbourne House in Edgbaston, his most important individual commission and one of the finest houses of its period in the Birmingham area, comparable to contemporary work by other notable Birmingham Arts and Crafts architects such as William Bidlake, Charles Bateman and Herbert Tudor Buckland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Architecture of Birmingham", "response": ["The early 1890s saw a sudden change in Birmingham's dominant architectural style, as High Gothic gave way to a distinctive local school of Arts and Crafts architecture. Buildings came increasingly to be designed in an understated style that limited ornament and was based on traditional forms of local vernacular architecture, in Birmingham largely brick, roughcast and half-timbering. Design emphasised the simple and honest expression of the building's construction, highlighting structural elements such as the bonds of the brickwork, and often emphasising differences in the function of elements of the building through the deliberate creation of awkward juxtapositions and contrasts. Buildings often featured decorative elements such as furnishings, friezes or paintings by local artists and craftsmen \u2013 particularly by the Birmingham Group which formed around the Birmingham School of Art in the 1880s \u2013 considering these to be integral to the design of the building to form a \"total work of art\".  The Arts and Crafts philosophy was an approach to design rather than a defined style, however, and the work of Arts and Crafts architects within Birmingham ranged from the eclectic and spectacular Elizabethan revival work of Crouch and Butler to the Methodist purism of Joseph Lancaster Ball; and from the politically radical austerity of Arthur Stansfield Dixon; to the mystically-charged symbolism of the work of William Lethaby.", "File:Detail of Winterbourne House, Edgbaston, Birmingham - Joseph Lancaster Ball.jpg|Winterbourne, by Joseph Lancaster Ball, 1903"]}, {"page": "Listed buildings in Birmingham", "response": ["|W.R.
