The day after, Kevin Davies was called up into the England squad for the first time and included in the squad to play Montenegro on 12 October. Later in the week, Gary Cahill was called into the squad as a late replacement for Phil Jagielka, meaning that, for the first time since Eddie Hopkinson and Doug Holden in 1959, Bolton had two representatives in the England squad.

After losing to Blackburn in the League Cup midweek, Ipswich went into their next home league game against Bolton Wanderers after two consecutive defeats, a situation they had not been in since late August.  Bolton took the lead through Doug Holden but two goals from Crawford in the last seven minutes secured a 2\u20131 victory for Ipswich who The Observer Arlott described as making a \"mockery of footballing justice \u2014 if it exists.\"  Two days before Christmas, Ipswich travelled to Maine Road to face Manchester City on a frozen pitch.  Although they had not won in eight games, City were 2\u20130 ahead by half time.  Neil Young scored City's third and with Ipswich being denied a goal with numerous saves from Bert Trautmann, the match ended 3\u20130, inflicting Ipswich's third defeat in their last four games.  The Boxing Day fixture saw Leicester City visit Portman Road for the first competitive fixture in the clubs' histories.  Leadbetter missed his first match in 156 games with a knee injury.  Crawford scored past Gordon Banks midway through the second half to secure the points for Ipswich.  The return fixture, scheduled for 30 December at Filbert Street, was called off on the morning of the match due to a frozen pitch.  Ipswich finished the year in fourth place, three points behind leaders Burnley who had two games in hand."]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 in English football", "response": ["* 7 April 2021: Doug Holden, 90, England, Bolton Wanderers and Preston North End winger."]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Doug Holden, English professional footballer (b. 1930)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2021", "response": ["*Doug Holden, 90, English footballer (Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, national team).Last survivor of 1953 FA Cup Final, ex-Bolton & Preston winger Doug Holden passes away at 90"]}]}}
