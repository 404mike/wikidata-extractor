However, his registration papers were lost after heavy bombing in the Birmingham area. In the summer of 1948, Timmins signed for Coventry City.Timmins had given up hope of pursuing a career in top-flight football and was playing for non-league Jack Moulds Athletic in Birmingham when Coventry manager Harry Storer turned up unannounced at the Timmins family home and persuaded him to sign for Coventry City. Timmins spent 11 years at Coventry, including three years as club captain. During the 1955\u201356 season, Timmins was touted by press as the \"best full back outside the top flight\" and speculation grew that he would join teammate Reg Matthews in the England squad. Coventry turned down a substantial bid from Newcastle United for Timmins during his time at Highfield Road. He played a total of 165 games (161 in the Football League) and scored five goals before leaving Coventry to join Leamington in 1959, aged 37.Timmins then spent the 1960\u201361 season coaching Evesham United before finally retiring aged 39.
