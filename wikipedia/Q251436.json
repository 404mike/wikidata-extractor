Campbell Parkin doubled the lead with a close-range effort from a corner in the twentieth minute. It was Parkin's second final, as he had played in the losing Dunedin Technical side in the 2008 final. Nathan Strom reduced the deficit with a 34th-minute header, and Bay olympic continued to push for the rest of the half and the first few minutes of the second spell. With fifteen minutes remaining, it was Miramar who gained their third however, with a run by Michael White through the Bay defence. Olympic had a chance to reduce the deficit shortly afterwards when an ill-timed challenge on Joe Edwards by Schaeffers gave them a penalty. Goalkeeper Phil Imray kept out Strom's spot kick, and the score remained 3\u20131."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 New Zealand Football Championship", "response": ["|  ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Michael White ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| 15px YoungHeart Manawatu"]}, {"page": "Richmond Athletic FC", "response": ["*  Michael White (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Arbroath F.C. season", "response": ["| Michael White", "|  Michael White"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 New Zealand Football Championship", "response": ["|  ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| Michael White ||style=\"text-align:left;\"| 15px|border Canterbury United"]}, {"page": "2003 OFC U-17 Championship", "response": ["* Michael White"]}]}}
