Crean, who had a background in competitive fencing, began choreographing fights in 1932 when he was working in England as an actor in The Legends of Don Juan.  He received public acclaim for choreographing the impressive fight scenes for John Guilgud's 1944-45 season of Hamlet at the Haymarket, with a personal feature on Path\u00e9 News and in Post Magazine.  Crean and his partner Rex Rickman were frequently hired to stage fight scenes for theatrical productions as well as in films such as The Master of Ballantrae (1953) and Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960). They both ran the Sophy School of Fencing in London and used it to teach many celebrities sword work for stage and films. He worked with actors including Paul Scofield, Laurence Olivier, Trevor Howard, Alec Guinness, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Errol Flynn, often performing as Flynn's stunt double in films.\nCrean travelled to the Canadian Stratford Theatre Festival in 1962 to serve as the fight arranger for Macbeth, directed by Peter Coe. After his second season in 1963, he decided to make Stratford, Ontario his home and worked as the festival's fight director until 1983. Among festival productions for which he arranged the swordplay, The Three Musketeers, directed by John Hirsch in 1968, received great acclaim for its stage action. Crean returned from retirement in 1988 to assist fight director Jean-Pierre Fournier for The Three Musketeers as directed by Richard Ouzounian.\nCrean's choreographic philosophy included tenets such as matching the combat to the character and included research into various historical and cultural forms of swordplay. His system of stage combat safety protocols were highly influential around the world. Those guidelines were codified through the Society of British Fight Directors, for which Crean was a fight master. He was also a certified fight master with Fight Directors Canada as well as being an honorary member of the Society of American Fight Directors.\nCrean continued to work as an actor, sometimes taking small roles in shows for which he had done fight arranging and also performing his one-man show about Rudyard Kipling, The Sun Never Sets, at Stratford's Avon Theatre in 1970.\nHis autobiography, More Champagne, Darling (ISBN 0075480778), was published in Toronto by McGraw-Hill Ryerson in 1981.\nThe annual Paddy Crean International Stage Combat Conferences, named in honour of Mr. Crean, present a wide range of seminars run by prominent stage combat and martial arts instructors.\nPatrick Crean died on 22 December 2003, at the age of 92. He was once married to the actress Helen Christie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stage combat", "response": ["Cinematic fencing has its roots in the 1920s, with the movies of Douglas Fairbanks. One of the more celebrated fight directors who emerged in this time was Paddy Crean who revolutionized stage combat, specifically sword play, for the silver screen and theater. Paddy created the flamboyant style of sword play that can be seen in Errol Flynn movies, among others. He promoted the use of safety above all things and then focused on story of the fight. B. H. Barry and J. Allen Suddeth, students of Paddy Crean, are two fight masters who have continued developing Paddy's legacy. Barry helped found the Society of British Fight Directors and then came to the United States to give fight direction a more specific shape. J. Allen Suddeth founded the National Fight Directors Training Program in the United States and wrote the book \"Fight Direction for the Theater\" (1996). Martial arts movies emerge as a distinct genre from the 1940s, popularized by Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba from the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Seven Hills of Rome (film)", "response": ["* Paddy Crean  as Mr. Fante"]}, {"page": "Crean", "response": ["* Paddy Crean (1911\u20132003), British actor"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Medieval reenactment", "response": ["Paddy Creannot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Patrick Crean", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paddy Crean"]}]}}
