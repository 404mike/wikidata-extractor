Withering deduced that digitalis was the active ingredient in the formulation, and  over the ensuing nine years he carefully tried out different preparations of various parts of the plant (collected in different seasons) documenting 156 cases where he had employed digitalis, and describing the effects and the best - and safest - way of using it.  At least one of these cases was a patient for whom Erasmus Darwin had asked Withering for his second opinion.  In January 1785 Darwin submitted a paper entitled \"An Account of the Successful Use of Foxglove in Some Dropsies and in Pulmonary Consumption\" to the College of Physicians in London;Medical Transactions, Volume 3, 1785, published by the College of Physicians, London.

After this, Darwin and Withering became increasingly estranged, and eventually a argument broke out apparently resulting from Robert Darwin having accused Withering of unprofessional behaviour by effectively poaching patients. This is a very early example of medical academic plagiarism.

His proposition that all species of life have descended from common ancestors is now widely accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.
