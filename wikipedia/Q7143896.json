He has attributed the start of this interest to experiences including seeing an entertainer at a children's party and watching television programmes such as the David Nixon show. When he was nine his parents gave him a David Nixon Magic set as a Christmas present and thereafter he became a dedicated performer always seeking to learn new tricks. During a school trip to London to visit the British Museum he stumbled upon the Davenports magic shop, to which he would return often during his teens as he sought to learn more about professional magic. At Davenports he met magician Pat Page who became a mentor and lifelong friend.
