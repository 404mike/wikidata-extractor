The last five minutes were assigned to the Weather Forecast  every day of the week, with the biggest listening figures being at weekends when parents joined in too. It was the time of day during the week when children could be expected to be home from school, and was aimed at an audience aged about 5 to 15 years.  Programming was imbued with Reithian virtues, and Children's Hour was often criticised, like \"Auntie\" BBC itself, for paternalism and middle-class values. It was nonetheless hugely popular, and its presenters were national figures, their voices instantly recognisable.  Derek McCulloch was closely involved with the programme from 1926, and ran the department from 1933 until 1950, when he had to resign for health reasons. From 1928 to 1960, Children's Hour in Scotland was organised and presented by Kathleen Garscadden, known as Auntie Kathleen, whose popularity brought crowds to the radio station in Glasgow.W. H. McDowell, \u2018Garscadden, Kathleen Mary Evelyn (1897\u20131991)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009  Popular nature study programmes on Children's Hour were presented by George Bramwell Evens ('Romany of the BBC'), Norman Ellison ('Nomad of the BBC') and David Seth-Smith (the 'Zoo Man of the BBC') in England and Wales during the 1930s, 40s and 50s.  On Scottish Children's Hour their equivalents were Gilbert Dempster Fisher (the 'Hut Man of the BBC'), James Douglas-Home (the 'Bird Man'), and Thomas Haining Gillespie (known later as the 'Zoo Man of the Scottish BBC')."]}, {"page": "Thomas Haining Gillespie", "response": ["Gillespie was well known on the Scottish Children's Hour radio programme as 'the Zoo Man' who gave talks about the animals in Edinburgh Zoo and who answered nature questions in a panel programme produced by Kathleen Garscadden. His contributions to these Children's Hour programmes began in 1926 when they were broadcast by the Edinburgh and Glasgow stations of the BBC. He was, in those early years, probably not billed as 'the Zoo Man' of the BBC - that title, for English stations at least, was given to David Seth-Smith who broadcast on Children's Hour and published books as 'Zoo Man of the BBC' in the 1930s. Gillespie's early books did not include the Zoo man nickname. However Gillespie was, by the late 1950s, being described as the 'Zoo man of the Scottish BBC' and he published books under that name from 1960 onwards.As is evidenced by the issues of the Radio Times for the period. His early radio talks were published in a series of 'Zoo Tales' books which are listed below. He appears in a group photograph with Garscadden, the 'Bird Man of the BBC' (James Douglas-Home), and the 'Hut Man of the BBC' (Gilbert D. Fisher). He is referred to as 'Tom H. Gillespie' in reference to this group photograph."]}, {"page": "Kathleen Garsgadden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kathleen Garscadden"]}, {"page": "Garscadden (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Kathleen Garscadden (1897\u20131991), Scottish radio presenter"]}]}}
