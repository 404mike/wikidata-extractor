The memorial includes a bronze statue of a nude warrior, carrying a flaming cross and wielding a sword with which he defends two children from a serpent, erected on a granite plinth, with bronze plaques listing the names of the dead. Goulden designed a number of such allegorical memorials, including others at Crompton, Greater Manchester, and Redhill, Surrey.

He had trained as a sculptor at the Dover School of Art and at the National Art Training School, followed by a pre-war career as a teacher and artist. In 1920 he won a commission to design the Bank of England War Memorial to commemorate the staff of the Bank of England who had died in the war. His chosen subject was St Christopher carrying a child, and this allegorical approach, which Historic England terms manhood defending, became a regular motif in his work, as it is at Kingston.

The surrounding buildings of the bank are separately listed at Grade I.", "Successful fundraising allowed the committee to recommend a more ambitious memorial structure than the intended memorial cross.  The committee approached Sir George Frampton, and he introduced them to Richard Reginald Goulden as a promising sculptor.  Goulden was commissioned to design and make the memorial sculpture.  Goulden's first design was approved by the committee but rejected by the bank's court of directors, but his second design, portraying St Christopher carrying the Holy Child, was accepted.  The design reflected the location, as the bank's garden was the site of the church of St Christopher le Stocks until it was demolished in 1781, and Saint Christopher is the bank's patron saint; and it also reflects the spirit of service and self-sacrifice embodied by Saint Christopher.  The materials for the sculpture cost \u00a3750, with a payment to Goulden of \u00a3105.  A further fundraising gathered \u00a3300 to inscribe the names of the war dead at the base of the statue.
