Eventually however, John was switched back to left half, and this time he remained a first-team regular. A prodigious ball-winner and noted passer of the ball, John reached (but lost) the FA Cup Final with Arsenal in 1926\u201327, after a mistake by his compatriot and close friend Dan Lewis; it was John who consoled Lewis after the final whistle, assuring him he would get another chance to a win a medal (although Lewis never did).

By now, Hoar played more often on the right than the left, but the arrival of Joe Hulme put in 1926 forced him out of the Arsenal first team and he spent most of 1926-27 on the sidelines. However, Hoar forced himself back in the side towards the end of the season, taking over Sam Haden's spot on the left wing.
