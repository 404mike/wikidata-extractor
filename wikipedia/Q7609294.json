He was the younger son of Clive Gardiner, painter and principal of Goldsmiths College from 1929 to 1958, and Lilian Lancaster, also a painter and one of Walter Sickert's favourite pupils at the Slade.  His paternal grandfather was the journalist A. G. Gardiner.  His elder brother, Patrick Gardiner, became a professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford.\nHe was educated at Dulwich College, and served in the Royal Navy from 1942. He studied at the Architectural Association and qualified as an architect in 1948.  He then worked for Wells Coates, then for short periods with Richard Blow and Peter Dickinson, and with Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew.  He worked with Richard Sheppard from 1951 to 1957, working mainly on schools.\nHe founded his own practice in 1957, and was in partnership with Christopher Knight in the 1960s.  Perhaps his crowning achievement was designing a new house at Stratton Park in Hampshire for Sir John Baring, replacing a late 18th-century house by George Dance with a modern building largely in brick with a steel conservatory.  The original building was demolished, but the Tuscan portico was left standing as an architectural feature in front of the house.  He also worked on many school buildings in and around London.  He became a business partner of Joan Scotson in 1970, who later became his wife.  He received the OBE in 2002 for his contribution to community architecture.\nConcerned at the precarious nature of his profession, and the number of projects that were never built, he also taught architecture.  He taught at the Architectural Association from 1955 to 1956, and at the Oxford School of Architecture (now part of Oxford Brookes University) from 1957 to 1968, at the University of Westminster from 1970 to 1974, at Washington University in St Louis in 1978, at Cheltenham College from 1979 to 1981, and at the University of London from 1981 to 1986.\nGardiner was also a writer.  He wrote a thriller, Death is an Artist in 1958.  He wrote for the London Magazine for 37 years, from 1964 to 2001, and was architectural correspondent for The Observer for 23 years, writing a weekly column from 1970 to 1993.  He also wrote for The Spectator, The Times, the Architectural Review, and the RIBA Journal.\nHe also wrote several books on architectural subjects, including Evolution of the House (1974), a monograph on Le Corbusier (Fontana Modern Masters, 1974), Kuwait: The Making of a City (1984) and The House: Its Origins and Evolution (2002).  He wrote two biographies,  Epstein: Artist Against the Establishment (1992), and Frink, a life of the sculptor Elisabeth Frink (1997).  Le Corbusier was a significant influence on his professional work, and he knew both Jacob Epstein and Elisabeth Frink.  He also published poetry, and exhibited paintings and drawings.\nHe married four times.  His first marriage, to Shirley Warwick, second marriage, to Lucy Ward, and third marriage, to Shirley Blomfield, all ended in divorce.  He married Joan Scotson in 1979, living on the King's Road in Chelsea until 2002, when they moved to Tunbridge Wells.  He died at Pembury in Kent.  He was survived by his fourth wife, and a son and daughter from his third marriage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen Gardiner", "response": ["Stephen Gardiner (27 July 1483Lindsey, Karen, xvii, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived, Perseus Books, 1995. \u2013 12 November 1555) was an English bishop and politician during the English Reformation period who served as Lord Chancellor during the reign of Queen Mary I and King Philip.", "Before long his abilities attracted the notice of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who made him his secretary,\"Stephen Gardiner (1483 \u2013 1555), Bishop of Winchester\", National Trust Collections and in this capacity he is said to have been with him at The More in Hertfordshire, when the conclusion of the celebrated Treaty of the More brought King Henry VIII and the French ambassadors there.

Henry had made provision in his will for a 16-man Council to rule England during his son Edward's minority (Edward VI). Gardiner was excluded from this council. Edward Seymour, a brother of Jane Seymour, seized power as Protector Somerset and he and his Council introduced radical Protestant reforms. Gardiner completely opposed these reforms. Between the time of Henry VIII's death in January 1547 and the end of that year, Gardiner wrote at least 25 indignant letters arguing that the reforms were both theologically wrong and unconstitutional. Most of these letters were addressed to Somerset.The Letters of Stephen Gardiner, ed.

Although soon released, he was summoned before the council, which demanded an explanation. Refusing to answer satisfactorily on some points, Gardiner was imprisoned in the Tower of London. Eventually he was given a lengthy appearance before the Privy Council, beginning in December 1550 and, in February 1551 he was deprived of his bishopric and returned to the Tower where he remained for the rest of the reign (a further two years).The Letters of Stephen Gardiner, op.cit. During this time he unsuccessfully requested his acknowledged right as one of the Lords Spiritual to appear before the House of Lords. His bishopric was given to John Ponet, a chaplain of Cranmer's, translated from the bishopric of Rochester.", "Bishop Gardiner died at Westminster on 12 November 1555.  He was temporarily buried in a vault at the church of St Mary Overie, and in February 1556 his body was conveyed to Winchester Cathedral, where, after a number of ceremonies, a final funeral service was conducted on 28 February 1556, at which time it was recorded that he had not been buried and that no ground was broken, in the expectation that in due course his executors would build a chapel within the cathedral for his incarceration.Heralds' Account of Gardiner's Obsequies, College of Arms, cited in The Letters of Stephen Gardiner, op.cit. pp.502-517 Some claim that his last words were Erravi cum Petro, sed non flevi cum Petro (Like Peter, I have erred, unlike Peter, I have not wept).Latham, Edward.
