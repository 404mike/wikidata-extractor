Included in the supergroup are the Ferrar Dolerite sills and dykes, the Kirkpatrick Basalts, and the volcanogenic Carapace Sandstone and Mawson Formation."]}, {"page": "V\u00edctor Alberto Ramos", "response": ["Ramos has proposed that the Patagonian landmass originated as an allochtonous terrane that separated from Antarctica and docked in South America 250 to 270 Ma in the Permian period.
