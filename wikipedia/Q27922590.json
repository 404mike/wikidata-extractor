In the 55th minute, a free kick from Jacobson went over the crossbar, and in the following minute Oxford equalised. A cross from Sykes from a tight angle beat Allsop and made it 1\u20131.  Eight minutes later, Henry made a run into the Wycombe box and passed to Taylor whose shot went wide.  Wycombe then made two further substitutions in the 64th minute, Akinfenwa and Curtis Thompson replacing Samuel and Ofoborh.  Stewart once again made a saving tackle to deny Taylor before Allsop saved an attempt from Robert Dickie.  After the second-half drinks break, Thompson was booked in the 73rd minute for a foul on Kelly.  On 77 minutes,  the Oxford goalkeeper Eastwood fouled Onyadinma and a penalty was awarded.  Jacobson struck the spot kick down the centre as Eastwood dived to his left, giving Wycombe the lead once again.  Oxford responded by making two further substitutions, Anthony Forde and Dan Agyei replacing Long and Henry.  Heavy rain began to fall and in the 87th minute a Forde cross was headed into Allsop's hands by Taylor.  Agyei and Taylor then combined but Stewart once again denied the chance. On 89 minutes, Ben Woodburn replaced Browne.  Five minutes of additional time was indicated and three minutes in, Nick Freeman came on to replace Onyadinma.  The match ended 2\u20131 to Wycombe who were promoted to the EFL Championship for the first time in their 133-year history.", "|MF ||22|| Nick Freeman || || "]}]}}
