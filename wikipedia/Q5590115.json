There were no new names in the Bristol City team that took the field in the opening game a 2\u20131 win v Swansea Town on 20 August 1955 which was the Second Division debut for Atyeo. Two days later Atyeo scored the first of many goals in the Second Division in a 3\u20131 win at Rotherham United. Atyeo played at inside right throughout the season with Eisentrager as his regular right wing partner until Pat Beasley signed Wally Hinshelwood for \u00a315,000 from Reading in February 1956. Jimmy Rogers had his most productive goalscoring season with 25 goals from centre forward. Tommy Burden provided the skill and drive at inside left and Jack Boxley was on the left wing  completing the regular forward line. Atyeo missed only 3 league games, all of which were defeats, two against Leeds United. Atyeo had a productive first half of the season scoring 20 goals in his first 19 games as the \"Robins\" stormed to the top of the table in mid November and remained at the summit until Christmas Eve. Atyeo scored a hat-trick (including a penalty) in a 3\u20131 win v Bury on 17 September and another hat-trick in a 5\u20131 win v Lincoln City on 3 December. City only won seven more league games after the win over Lincoln City and finished in 11th position in the final Second Division table as Atyeo scored only 10 more goals in the remaining 20 matches, still a good goals per game ratio. Overall Atyeo made 39 appearances and scored 30 goals in the league recording the highest total of league goals in a season in his career. This is the closest Atyeo came to the Bristol City record for goals in a season held by Don Clark with 36 goals in 1946\u201347. In the FA Cup a crowd of 46,493 saw City defeated 1\u20133 in the 3rd round at Everton. However the 46,713 who witnessed the 1\u20132 league defeat at Liverpool became the largest crowd to watch Atyeo in Bristol City colours, that is, until the following season. Frankfurt, Nice and Stuttgart Kickers were the European teams welcomed to Ashton Gate for first team friendlies with Atyeo a regular scorer in the friendlies.", "Bristol City spent another season in 1957\u201358 struggling to avoid dropping into the relegation places. A poor run in mid season of only a single win in 14 matches between mid November and the start of March 1958 prompted a change of manager with Pat Beasley sacked on 6 January. There followed a three-week spell of caretaker management until Harry Dolman secured Peter Doherty as the new manager from Doncaster Rovers whom Dolman had first sought some nine years earlier. Doherty was quick to sign inside right Bert Tindill from Doncaster Rovers for \u00a36,400 on 3 February and seven wins in the last 12 games lifted the \"Robins\" to safety and a 17th-place finish in the Second Division. The forward line had a distinctly more stable look in 1957\u201358 with wingers Hinshelwood and Watkins, Atyeo at centre forward and Etheridge at inside left. Tommy Burden, Curtis, Eisentrager and latterly Tindill also all featured in short spells across the forward line. Atyeo was the only ever present player with 42 appearances and ended as leading scorer with 23 goals including a hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win at Sheffield United. Tindill scored ten goals in only 14 appearances including successive hat-tricks in April wins v Barnsley and at Fulham. In the FA Cup the 5th round tie v Bristol Rovers at Ashton Gate drew a crowd of 39,160 but resulted in a 3\u20134 defeat to the local rivals. Atyeo scored twice in a mid season friendly 4\u20133 win over Tottenham Hotspur."]}, {"page": "List of Leeds United F.C. players", "response": ["|1949||1954||Tommy Burden||||"]}, {"page": "List of footballers in England by number of league appearances", "response": ["!scope=row data-sort-value=\"Burden, Tommy\"|Tommy Burden"]}, {"page": "Jack White (footballer, born 1924)", "response": ["\"Jack\" White a former miner played locally for Broadworth Main and Frickley Colliery in Yorkshire.
