These flaws include: 1) a constructivism which fails to recognise the cognitive and social processes that underpin social 'reality'; 2) an excessive emphasis on ethnic boundaries as opposed to ethnic narratives, thereby overstating the degree of malleability possible in ethnic identity; 3) a tacit belief in white exceptionalism, which overemphasises the ideological character of whiteness and deifies whites; 4) an elision of dominant ethnicity and race; and 5) a threefold parochialism in terms of place, time horizon and the role of race in ethnic studies.\"Kaufmann then proposes, as an alternative approach to the study of white identity, the emerging concept of \"dominant ethnicity\", using Anthony D. Smith's definition of \"ethnic group\" as a \"named, imagined, human community, many of whose members believe in a myth of shared ancestry and place of origin.\""]}, {"page": "Nationalist historiography", "response": ["Nationalism was so much taken for granted as the \"proper\" way to organize states and view history that nationalization of history was essentially invisible to historians until fairly recently.

Smith agrees to an extent, as from his ethnosymbolist perspective the ethnic core necessary for the development of modern nations had begun to crystallise during the fourteenth-century.

It also includes ideas of a culture shared between members of the group and with their ancestors, and usually a shared language.  Membership in the nation is hereditary. The state derives political legitimacy from its status as homeland of the ethnic group, and from its duty to protect of the partly national group and facilitate its family and social life, as a group. Ideas of ethnicity are very old, but modern ethnic nationalism was heavily influenced by Johann Gottfried von Herder, who promoted the concept of the Volk, and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Theorist Anthony D. Smith uses the term 'ethnic nationalism' for non-Western concepts of nationalism, as opposed to Western views of a nation defined by its geographical territory. The term \"ethnonationalism\" is generally used only in reference to nationalists who espouse an explicit ideology along these lines; \"ethnic nationalism\" is the more generic term, and used for nationalists who hold these beliefs in an informal, instinctive, or unsystematic way.  The pejorative form of both is \"ethnocentric nationalism\" or \"tribal nationalism,\" though \"tribal nationalism\" can have a non-pejorative meaning when discussing African, Native American, or other nationalisms that openly assert a tribal identity."]}, {"page": "Anthony D Smith", "response": ["#redirectAnthony D.
