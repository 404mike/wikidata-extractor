The American Revolution had occurred only two decades earlier, the events of the French Revolution were even more recent, and the Haitian Revolution, the most successful of the African slave rebellions in the Western Hemisphere, was in process. Ideas about enfranchisement, liberty, and equality were widespread. To Polwhele and others who shared his perspective, these ideas were perceived as attacks on religion, the monarchy, and the government. Women's advocacy of access to educationSee History of Feminism was confused with the most outrageous actions ascribed to the revolutionaries: free love, irreligion, and violent upheaval. Some commenters went so far as to blame the French Revolution on \"a notorious dereliction of female principle\" and \"the dissipated and indelicate behaviour and loose morals\" of French women.Jane West, Letters to a Young Lady, in which the Duties and Character of women are considered, 3 vols. (London, 1806), I 58. Many of those who had initially supported the French Revolution turned away from the excesses of the Terror, and Britain was gripped by a strong backlash against any ideas that seemed in the least revolutionary. Janet Todd wrote that \"Britain, once priding itself on being the most politically enlightened and liberal state in Europe, came to define itself in increasingly conservative, patriotic, and anti-French terms.\"Janet Todd, The Sign of Angelica: women, writing and fiction, 1600\u20131800 (London: Virgo, 1989. 196.) See also John Bull. \"Gallic\" and \"French\" came to mean, in the popular imagination, \"revolutionary,\" so when Polwhele writes of \"Gallic freaks\" (l. 21) he is not merely describing fashions in clothing. Those Britons who sympathized with the French Revolution were known as \"Jacobins.\" Those who opposed it were \"Anti-Jacobins.\" The Antijacobin, or Weekly Examiner (1797\u20131798), the Anti-Jacobin Review, and the British Critic (1793\u20131843), were among the conservative journals that grew up during this highly polarized period. Polwhele, a conservative member of the Anglican clergy, was himself a contributor to the Anti-Jacobin Review. According to Eleanor Ty, although feminist thought had existed for decades, the women of the 1790s seemed \"particularly threatening to the anti-Jacobins\" because of \"the outspoken claiming of their 'rights' shortly after and coinciding with the events in France that culminated in the Revolution.\"Eleanor Rose Ty, Unsex'd Revolutionaries: Five Women Novelists of the 1790s (University of Toronto Press, 1993. 4)."]}, {"page": "Reception history of Jane Austen", "response": ["The war with France that began in 1793 was seen as an ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led conservative writers such as Jane West, Hannah More, and Elizabeth Hamilton to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their \"modesty\", as defined by conduct books, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French.Irvine 34\u201335. Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony.Irvine 130. In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in Sense and Sensibility that the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead of warmth and comfort; in Mansfield Park the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and Northanger Abbey where satirizing Gothic stories gives \"a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression\" as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man.Irvine 130\u201331. Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in Mansfield Park is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers.Irvine 131. Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy.Irvine 132. Irvine, in a critique of the work of feminist scholars like Johnson and Kirkham, argued that if Austen was indeed an Enlightenment feminist, there were clearly limits to her radicalism as Austen never criticised either explicitly or implicitly the hierarchical structure of British society, with her villains failing to live up to the standards expected of their class, instead of their moral failures being presented as a product of the social system.Irvine 129. Writing about the work of Johnson, Irvine wrote that for her, Austen was a radical because it is women like Emma Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Mrs. Churchill who really run Highbury society, undercutting traditional gender roles, but Irvine questioned whether this really made Austen into radical, noting it was the wealth and status of the gentry women of Highbury that gave them their power.Irvine, 133. Irvine argued it was just as possible to see Emma as a conservative novel that upholds the superiority of the gentry, writing that Johnson was \"close here to defining 'conservative' in terms of gender politics alone\". Likewise, Elizabeth may defy Lady Catherine de Bourgh who wants to keep her in place by marrying Mr. Darcy, who comes from old landed family, which Irivine used to argue that while Pride and Prejudice does have a strong heroine, the book does not criticise the structure of English society.Irvine, 134."]}, {"page": "1758 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 30 April \u2013 Jane West, writer (died 1852)"]}, {"page": "West (name)", "response": ["* Jane West (1758\u20131852), British writer and poet", "* Jane West (campaigner), American cannabis activist"]}, {"page": "Jacobin novel", "response": ["Along with Walker there were Elizabeth Hamilton, Robert Bisset, Henry James Pye, Charles Lloyd, Jane West, and Edward Dubois.

Butler argues that one measure of a conservative writer is \"whether the plot, broadly, suggests a victim suffering at the hands of society\". Butler argues that Austen's novels are so structured, and thus conservative. She divides Austen's works into two kinds: stories involving a \"Heroine who is Right\" and a spokeswoman for conservative orthodoxy, and stories involving a \"Heroine who is Wrong\" who must learn from her mistakes by recognizing them and resolving to do better. In the novels in which the \"Heroine is Right\", the same process of error, self-knowledge and resolve to follow reason is present, but in another principal character or characters. The \"Heroine who is Right\" helps bring about the change in these other characters.Butler, 165\u2013167. Butler contends that \"Austen's stress upon her heroines' subordinate role in a family, upon their dutifulness, meditativeness, self-abnegation and self-control, were codes shared with other conservative writers, especially women moralists such as Jane West and Mary Brunton.
