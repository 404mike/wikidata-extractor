When interviewed in 2004 for the book 'Twelve Canary Greats', Allcock stated that his decision to sign for Bolton was made when his Father's job moved to Blackpool and Bolton permitted him to commute from there. He made his first team debut in October 1953 against Manchester City and scored twice in the first twenty minutes. Despite his good start, Allcock was unable to secure a regular first team spot at Burnden Park because he was competing against internationals Nat Lofthouse, Willie Moir and Harold Hassall for a place in the side.
