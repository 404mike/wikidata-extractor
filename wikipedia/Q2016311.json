D. Wilson in the Wind River Range. They were the first to ascend the south slopes of Wind River Peak, and, with Wilson, Yount was the first to ascend West Atlantic Peak. Hayden's expedition of 1878 conducted surveys in Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas in 1878. That expedition included the British mountaineer James Eccles and Eccles's favorite Swiss mountain guide, Michel Payot of Chamonix. Eccles wanted to attempt an ascent of the Grand Teton, then unclimbed.  This was the third attempt to climb the Grand Teton by members of Hayden's expeditions. Yount served as the guide in a four-man party that included Eccles, Payot and Wilson. Eccles and Payot were held up by the disappearance of two mules carrying their gear, and so were unable to accompany Wilson and Yount on to the higher parts of the mountain. During the climb, Yount slipped on the ice and fell close to a deep chasm in the glacier, where water was streaming down from the cliff above.  The hold of his buckskin pants on the ice reportedly prevented him from being carried down into the crevice. Wilson was quoted as saying that Yount was clinging to the rock like \"a starfish hanging to a breakwater,\" and that he himself lowered a rope to assist Yount. Because of the delay and the absence of the experienced Alpine climbers, Yount and Wilson had to turn back a few hundred feet short of the summit, at a spur called The Enclosure.Ortenburger, Leigh N. and Jackson, Reynold G., A Climber's Guide to the Teton Range, The Mountaineers Books, 1996, p. 152 No previous party had come so close to reaching the summit. The undisputed first ascent of the Grand Teton took place 20 years later, in 1898."]}, {"page": "Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey", "response": ["Together with its neighbour \u2013 the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey (3,773 m) \u2013 the Aiguille Blanche forms part of the Peuterey ridge that leads, via the summit of the Grand Pilier d'Angle, to the summit of Mont Blanc. James Eccles, with guides Alphonse and Michel Payot, made the first ascent of the upper part of the ridge during their first ascent of Mont Blanc de Courmayeur on 31 July 1877.Dumler, Helmut and  Burkhardt, Willi P., The High Mountains of the Alps, London: Diadem, 1994, p. 193 The main ridge itself was first climbed via a couloir on the Brenva face by Paul G\u00fcssfeldt with Emile Rey, Christian Klucker and C\u00e9sar Ollier on 15\u201319 August 1893 (the second ascent was a week later by Klucker and John Percy Farrar). The first ascent of the complete ridge including the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey (the Int\u00e9grale) was on 28\u201331 July 1934 by Adolf G\u00f6ttner, Ludwig Schmaderer and Ferdinand Krobath."]}]}}
