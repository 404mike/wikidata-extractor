It met with immediate success and was soon the most widely bought provincial newspaper in Britain. Its editor was William Hill, a former Swedenborgian minister; Joshua Hobson was its publisher; and Bronterre O'Brien, former editor of the Poor Man's Guardian, became the principal leader-writer. Perhaps the most popular part of the paper was Feargus' weekly front page letter, often read aloud at meetings; but the inclusion of reports of Chartist meetings from around the country and of readers' poetry were also vital sections of a paper made it a very important instrument in unifying and promoting the Chartist cause."]}, {"page": "Northern Star (Chartist newspaper)", "response": ["From its start, Northern Star was a lively and innovative newspaper. It quickly abandoned the standard practice of devoting the front page to advertisements (O'Connor's weekly letter was prominent in the columns that took their place). Unusually for a provincial paper, each issue was published in various editions (sometimes as many of eight) tailored to different regions of the country.Mussell, Jim, \"Headnotes: Northern Star\", Nineteenth-century Serials Edition (NCSE) http://www.ncse.ac.uk/headnotes/nss.html O'Connor presented copies of engraved portraits of Chartist heroes to regular readers, effectively pioneering newspaper \"give aways\". The Star's poetry column not only printed the work of radical heroes such as Shelley and Shakespeare but hundreds of contributions by the paper's working-class readers.Chase, Malcolm, Chartism: A New History (2007), p. 119.Mike Sanders\u2019 The Poetry of Chartism, published in 2009, is a complete record of the poetry published in the Northern Star. Much of the credit for the astonishing success of the Northern Star is due to its publisher and general manager, Joshua Hobson, and the founding editor, William Hill, who was also a minister of the Swedenborgian New Jerusalem Church."]}, {"page": "Book of Murder", "response": ["The Book of Murder was a piece of anti-Poor Law propaganda presented as the work of one pseudonymous \"Marcus\", originally published in Britain during the 1830s by Joshua Hobson.Bloy, Marjie (16 November 2002). \"The Book of Murder\". The Victorian Web. Retrieved 4 October 2010. It aimed to incite opposition to the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, claiming that Poor Law commissioners were intent on using infanticide to control the explosion in the population of the poor, which had been a fear of the working class since the adoption of the 1834 legislation."]}, {"page": "National Association of United Trades for the Protection of Labour", "response": ["No attempt had been made to co-ordinate the activities of trade unions in various industries across the country since the failure of the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union in 1834.Henry Pelling, A History of British Trade Unionism  The idea to found the organisation was first proposed by the Chartist newspaper the Northern Star, and was then taken up by the United Trades of Sheffield, who lobbied the Member of Parliament Thomas Duncombe.  This encouraged the Central Association of London Trades to convene a preliminary meeting for trade unionists in the city, which called a national conference for Easter 1845, held at London's Parthenium.  The conference founded the Association, appointing Duncombe as President and editor of the Northern Star Joshua Hobson to the Central Committee.David Goodway, London Chartism 1838\u20131848"]}, {"page": "Thomas Crowther", "response": ["Crowther, who said he spoke out on account of \u201cthe responsible nature of my office\u201d, seems to have confined to the pulpit his public calls for reform, perhaps under advice from Archdeacon Musgrave, the Vicar of Halifax, in whose parish and in whose gift his living lay.In 1844 Oastler lamented that neither Musgrave nor any of the Church of England clergy within his parish thought it their duty to attend public meetings in support of the Ten Hours Bill: The Halifax Guardian and Huddersfield and Bradford Advertiser, 13 April 1844. Musgrave (whose brother became Archbishop of York soon afterwards) had installed Crowther at St John\u2019s, was godfather to his youngest son (Charles Musgrave Crowther) and officiated at the marriages of his daughters. However, Oastler and his lieutenants continued to draw attention to the practices Crowther had exposed, and the name of Cragg Vale acquired an almost totemic significance for some of those calling for greater protection of factory children.See, for example, Joshua Hobson\u2019s 1843 reference to \u201csights at Cragg Dale hidden from public view but dragged to light by the labours of Mr Oastler\u201d (Halifax Guardian and Huddersfield and Bradford Advertiser, 16 December 1843), and Oastler\u2019s 1844 denunciation of \u201csuch places as Cragg Dale where more cruelty, oppression and fraud has been practised than in any part of England\u201d (Halifax Guardian and Huddersfield and Bradford Advertiser, 13 April 1844)."]}, {"page": "New Moral World", "response": ["Unlike Crisis, New Moral World was largely sold rather than given away, and therefore had a smaller circulation.  The newsagents who sold it typically also sold the Chartist Northern Star.  Initially published in London, publication moved to Manchester, Birmingham, then in 1839 to Leeds, where its publication was arranged by Joshua Hobson.  In 1842, publication moved back to London, then in 1845 to Harmony Hall in Hampshire.  This colony soon collapsed, and Owen sold the newspaper to James Hill, father of Octavia Hill.Gillian Darley, Octavia Hill, pp.27-28  George Fleming attempted to relaunch the paper as Moral World, but both the original and relaunched versions of the paper had stopped publication by the end of the year."]}]}}
