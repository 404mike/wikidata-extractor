This organization was, along with COBRA and the Lettrist International, involved in the formation of the Situationist International. Amongst those present at the founding in the Italian village of Cosio d'Arroscia were Walter Olmo, Mich\u00e8le Bernstein (later his second wife), Asger Jorn, and Guy Debord. However, within seven months Rumney had been 'amiably' expelled from the SI by Debord for allegedly \"failing to hand in a psychogeography report about Venice on time.\"\nRumney spent much of his life living as a wanderer, and was variously described as both a 'recluse' and a 'media whore', seeing his existence as a 'permanent adventure and endless experiment.' Rumney married Pegeen Guggenheim, the daughter of Peggy Guggenheim. He moved, as his friend Guy Atkins said, \"between penury and almost absurd affluence. One visited him in a squalid room in London's Neal Street, in a house shared with near down-and-outs. Next, one would find him in Harry's Bar in Venice, or at a Max Ernst opening in Paris. He seemed to take poverty with more equanimity than riches.\" \nRalph Rumney died of cancer at his home in Manosque, Provence, France, in 2002, aged 67.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Situationist International", "response": ["The most prominent member of the group, Guy Debord, generally became considered the organization's de facto leader and most distinguished theorist.

By 1957, however, most of the members of the Letterist International had either quit or been forcibly excluded, and the remnants opted to fuse with two other groups to form the Situationist International. Bernstein and Debord visited Cosio di Arroscia in July 1957: the Situationist International officially came into being there on 28 July. The other two groups involved were the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus and the London Psychogeographical Committee. The former was an offshoot of the earlier CoBrA group of artists; the latter was not really a 'group' at all, but merely a name given to a single British artist, Ralph Rumney.", "A few years later, Bernstein happened to encounter Ralph Rumney. Rumney, notwithstanding his presence at the foundation of the Situationist International, had been excluded after only about nine months. They had not seen one another for some twenty years, but they fell in together again and got married.

However, the journal suggests that the temporary ban applied to the K Foundation and WNLA itself, with the group committing to stop intervening in their activities entirely until 2018."]}, {"page": "Gil J. Wolman", "response": ["In 1955, Wolman wrote Why Lettrism?, also with Guy Debord, published in Potlatch no. 22. The following year, he represented the Letterist International at the World Congress of Artists in Alba, Italy. This conference established important links between the Letterist International and those figures (primarily Asger Jorn and Pinot-Gallizio of the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus) who would soon afterwards be joining forces with it to form the Situationist International. Wolman himself, however, never made it as far as the Situationist International. He was officially excluded from the Letterist International on 13 January 1957, just six months before the creation of the new group, the exclusion being announced in obituary format in Potlatch no. 28. Debord seems to have been the driving force behind the exclusion, which did cause some consternation among his colleagues. Even Mich\u00e8le Bernstein, Debord's wife at the time, has stated that she did not understand why Debord took so suddenly against Wolman.Andrew Hussey, The Game of War (Jonathan Cape, 2001), p. 117. Jean-Michel Mension, an early member of the Letterist International, recalls that \"Gil was reticent, sweet\u2014an incredibly sweet guy. I don't think I ever heard him actually raise his voice, except occasionally, except when he was reciting his poetry, but that was different. Everyone loved Gil.\"Jean-Michel Mension, The Tribe (Verse, 2002), p. 61. He also could not understand why Debord had excluded him, and observed: \"I think Wolman, in Guy's eyes, was a truly extraordinary artist, clearly superior to the other artists in the Letterist International. Personally, I've never believed in the exclusion of Gil.\".-Michel Mension (2002), p. 80. Ralph Rumney, an early member of the Situationist International, speculated that the real reason behind the exclusion was that Wolman and his wife, Violette, had just had a child: \"Guy, and Mich\u00e8le for that matter, had an absolute horror of domesticity and babies in particular. They were trying to experiment with new ways of living, which for Guy meant total sexual freedom. Wolman's happy family life could not be tolerated.\"The Game of War, p. 117."]}, {"page": "G\u00fcnther C. Kirchberger", "response": ["Kirchberger studied at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart from 1950-1954 where he came in close contact with abstract painter Willi Baumeister. In 1956 he went to London and became friends with Lawrence Alloway, Denis Bowen and Ralph Rumney. Back in Stuttgart, he founded gruppe 11 (group 11) together with Georg Karl Pfahler. The group had exhibitions in Munich, Brussel, Rome and London in 1957-59. In 1959 his art shifted from Art informel to color forms. In 1960 he comes in contact with the philosopher Max Bense and his circle, and 1964 he finally becomes a pure Hard Edge painter. Since 1964 he taught at the Werkkunstschule (School of Applied Arts) in Krefeld and began working with so called do-it-yourself paintings. One of his students was the later star photographer Peter Lindbergh. Since 1996 Kirchberger lived in Bad Boll, near G\u00f6ppingen. He died in G\u00f6ppingen in 2010.
