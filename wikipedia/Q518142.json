He was born in Caterham, England. He was one of the early pioneers of the finite element method. Since his first paper in 1947 dealing with numerical approximation to the stress analysis of dams, he published nearly 600 papers and wrote or edited more than 25 books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["* Olgierd Zienkiewicz, pioneer of computational methods for engineering"]}, {"page": "1921 in science", "response": ["* May 18 \u2013 Olgierd Zienkiewicz (died 2009), British civil engineer."]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Olgierd Zienkiewicz, academic (died 2009)"]}, {"page": "Finite element method in structural mechanics", "response": ["The origin of finite method can be traced to the matrix analysis of structures Matrix Analysis Of Framed Structures, 3rd Edition by Jr. William Weaver, James M.
