Respectable middle-class magazines, tabloids and comics alike spread stories of ruthless Chinese ambitions to destroy the west. The Chinese master-criminal (with his \"crafty yellow face twisted by a thin-lipped grin\", dreaming of world domination) had become a staple of children's publications. In 1911, \"The Chinese in England: A Growing National Problem\" (an article distributed around the Home Office) warned of \"a vast and convulsive Armageddon to determine who is to be the master of the world, the white or yellow man\". After the first world war, cinemas, theatres, novels and newspapers broadcast visions of the \"Yellow Peril\" machinating to corrupt white society.Julia Lovell, \"The Yellow Peril: Dr. Fu Manchu and the Rise of Chinaphobia by"]}, {"page": "Lu Xun", "response": ["Party leaders depicted him as \"drawing the blueprint of the communist future\" and Mao Zedong defined him as the \"chief commander of China's Cultural Revolution,\" although Lu did not join the party. During the 1920s and 1930s Lu Xun and his contemporaries often met informally for freewheeling intellectual discussions, but after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 the Party sought more control over intellectual life in China, and this type of intellectual independence was suppressed, often violently. Finally, Lu Xun's satirical and ironic writing style itself was discouraged, ridiculed, then as often as possible destroyed. In 1942, Mao wrote that \"the style of the essay should not simply be like Lu Xun's. [In a Communist society] we can shout at the top of our voices and have no need for veiled and round-about expressions, which are hard for the people to understand. During the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party both hailed Lu Xun as one of the fathers of communism in China, yet ironically suppressed the very intellectual culture and style of writing that he represented. Some of his essays and writings are now part of the primary school and middle school compulsory curriculum in China. Living under the rule of the dark forces and deprived of freedom of speech, Lu Hsun used burning satire and freezing irony, cast in the form of essays, to do battle; and he was entirely right. We, too, must hold up to sharp ridicule the fascists, the Chinese reactionaries and everything that harms the people; but in the Shensi-Kansu-Ningsia Border Region and the anti-Japanese base areas behind the enemy lines, where democracy and freedom are granted in full to the revolutionary writers and artists and withheld only from the counter-revolutionaries, the style of the essay should not simply be like Lu Hsun's. Here we can shout at the top of our voices and have no need for veiled and roundabout expressions, which are hard for the people to understand.\" In 2007 some of his bleaker works were removed from school textbooks. Julia Lovell, who has translated Lu Xun's writing, speculated that \"perhaps also it was an attempt to discourage the youth of today from Lu Xun's inconveniently fault-finding habits.\"", "Lu Xun's works became known to English readers as early as 1926 with the publication in Shanghai of The True Story of Ah Q, translated by George Kin Leung, and more widely beginning in 1936 with an anthology edited by Edgar Snow and Nym Wales  Living China, Modern Chinese Short Stories, in which Part One included seven of Lu Xun's stories and a short biography based on Snow's talks with Lu Xun.(New York: Reynal & Hitchcock,  1937. Reprinted: Westport, CT: Hyperion Press, 1973. . However, there was not a complete translation of the fiction until the four-volume set of his writings, which included Selected Stories of Lu Hsun translated by Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang. Another full selection was William A. Lyell. Diary of a Madman and Other Stories. (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press,  1990). In 2009, Penguin Classics published a complete translation by Julia Lovell of his fiction, The Real Story of Ah-Q and Other Tales of China: The Complete Fiction of Lu Xun, which the scholar Jeffrey WasserstromJeffrey Wasserstrom, UC Irvine, Department of History said \"could be considered the most significant Penguin Classic ever published.\""]}, {"page": "Taiping Rebellion", "response": ["* The Taiping Rebellion \u2013 BBC discussion with Rana Mitter, University of Oxford; Frances Wood British Library; and Julia Lovell, University of London."]}, {"page": "Journey to the West", "response": ["*  Julia Lovell's translation of selected chapters into lively contemporary English, with an extensive Introduction by Lovell and a Preface by Gene Luen Yang."]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["*Julia Lovell, Maoism: A Global History"]}, {"page": "In Our Time (radio series)", "response": ["The programme is considered one of the BBC's most successful projects, acknowledged to have \"transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time\".
