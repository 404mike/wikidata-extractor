He co-founded Oxford Instruments, one of the first spin-out companies from the University of Oxford and still one of the most successful.\nHe was educated at Gresham's School, Holt and Trinity College, Cambridge University, where he read engineering, and Imperial College, London. In 1945 he joined the Coal Board as a Bevin Boy for his National Service, working underground at the coal face first in South Wales and later in the Midlands. From 1955 to 1969, he was a Senior Research Officer at the Clarendon Laboratory at the University of Oxford. He used the knowledge he acquired on high field magnets to form Oxford Instruments in 1959. Two years later new superconductors were developed in the USA, and he soon acquired some material and made the first superconducting magnet outside the USA in 1962. Oxford Instruments has since developed these magnets for research and NMR analysis and eventually developed the whole-body superconducting magnets which made possible the development of magnetic resonance imaging.\nSir Martin and his wife, Audrey, have many philanthropic achievements, including donating \u00a32m for the building of the Sir Martin Wood Lecture Theatre at the Clarendon Laboratory. He also founded the Earth Trust to promote nature conservation at Little Wittenham and the Wittenham Clumps, The Oxford Trust for the promotion of scientific education and science-based enterprise, and the Sylva Foundation to support sustainable forest management. In 2005, Oxford Innovation, a company which came out of the Oxford Trust, launched the Martin and Audrey Wood Enterprise Awards for entrepreneurship.\nWood was knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace in 1986. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1987, was a recipient of the Order of the Rising Sun, and received honorary degrees from eight British universities.  He was President of Farm Africa, a development charity co-founded by his late brother Sir Michael Wood.He died after a short illness on 23 November 2021, at the age of 94. His work pioneering the development of super conducting magnets facilitated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), leading to millions of lives being saved every year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1927 in science", "response": ["* April 19 \u2013 Martin Wood (died 2021), English applied physicist."]}, {"page": "Oxford Instruments", "response": ["The company was founded by Sir Martin Wood in 1959 with help from his wife Audrey Wood (Lady Wood)Audrey Wood, Magnetic Venture: The Story of Oxford Instruments (Oxford University Press, 2001).  to manufacture superconducting magnets for use in scientific research, starting in his garden shed in Northmoor Road, Oxford, England.

It was built in 1760 but has a datestone giving the year 1806, probably referring to repairs or rebuilding work. It has four common sails and a fantail. It was modernised with some iron fittings in 1889, and seems to have ceased work early in the 20th century.  In about 1940 an amateur carpenter, a Mr Wood of Great Milton, started renting the mill from Lt-Col Muirhead for five shillings a year. Wood and his son conserved the mill by keeping the building weatherproof and repairing the machinery. In 1959 Wood's son, the engineer Sir Martin Wood, bought the mill, took over the project and in the 1970s undertook more maintenance and repairs.  In 2005 Sir Martin transferred ownership to the newly formed Great Haseley Windmill Trust, which has since continued the restoration. The cap (i.e. roof) has been restored and in June 2014 the Trust fitted new common sails and fantail, completing the external part of the mill's restoration."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Christ Church, Oxford", "response": ["* Sir Martin Wood (1927\u2013), engineer"]}, {"page": "Sir Martin Francis Wood", "response": ["#REDIRECTMartin Wood (engineer)"]}, {"page": "Martin Wood", "response": ["Martin Wood may refer to:", "* Martin Wood (director), Canadian television director", "* Sir Martin Wood (1927\u20132021), British engineer, co-founder of Oxford Instruments", "* Martin Wood (rugby league) (born 1970), English former Rugby League footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of Wolfson College, Oxford", "response": ["* Martin Wood"]}, {"page": "Yasunobu Nakamura", "response": ["* 1999 \u2013 The 1st Sir Martin Wood Prize for Japan"]}]}}
