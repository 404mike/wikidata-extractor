He was a strict disciplinarian and from the beginning set up a very high standard of work in his department. During his 17 years as director, over 60 geological maps were issued which were among the best of their period: they were models of accuracy which established a tradition of geological mapping in Australia. Selwyn was well qualified to analyse the Silurian strata. He was also responsible for several reports on the geology of Victoria and added much to the knowledge of gold-bearing rocks. Selwyn discovered the Caledonian goldfield near Melbourne in 1854 and in the following year reported on coal seams in Tasmania, until in 1869 the Colonial Legislature brought the Survey to an abrupt termination on economic grounds."]}, {"page": "Robert Etheridge", "response": ["His son Robert Etheridge, Junior was also a palaeontologist."]}, {"page": "1920 in Australia", "response": ["*4 January \u2013 Robert Etheridge, Junior (b. 1847), palaeontologist"]}, {"page": "Robert Logan Jack", "response": ["Jack was appointed geologist for northern Queensland in March 1876. He arrived in the colony in April 1877, and soon afterwards was made geologist for the whole colony, succeeding Richard Daintree. An early piece of work was an examination of the coal resources of the Cooktown district, and in August 1879 he began an exploring expedition to the most northerly part of Queensland in the hope that payable goldfields might be found. A second expedition was made towards the end of the year, and though no field of any great value was discovered, much was added to the knowledge of the country. The party endured many hardships and Jack himself was speared through the shoulder by hostile aborigines. In 1880 he published a work on the Mineral Wealth of Queensland, a Handbook to Queensland Geology appeared in 1886, and in 1892 with Robert Etheridge, Junior, The Geology and Palaeontology of Queensland and New Guinea was published in two volumes.

He had become assistant curator of the Australian museum in 1908 and in 1920 he succeeded Robert Etheridge, Junior as principal keeper of collections. During this time he worked with Joyce Allan, from whom he obtained illustrations for his scientific papers. He resigned in 1925 to become scientific director of the Great Barrier Reef Investigation Committee. Between April and August 1926 he was supervising the sinking of a bore on Michaelmas Reef near Cairns, and he returned to Sydney in August intending to visit Japan in connexion with the third Pan-Pacific Science Congress. Not being well he decided to abandon the journey, and though it was hoped that a rest would restore his health, he died suddenly on 14 September 1926.

Jack also mentioned in his report that the area between Wokingham Creek and the Diamantina River, just north of the town, was characterised by grey sandstones \"with occasional sandy ironstone or ironmasked sandstone\". He furthermore wrote that there was silicified wood strewn over the ground. Jack's report also makes clear that there are coal seams in the region. A well sunk about 1878 between Werna and Ayrshire Downs, about 50\u00a0km north of Collingwood, struck two such seams, and otherwise yielded strata of grey sandstones and sandy shales with beds of argillaceous flagstone (which contained seashells) and sandstone with iron pyrites. The well also yielded forth many fragments of silicified and carbonised wood. The boring ended at 204 feet (62\u00a0m) in hard, fine-grained sandstone. Water was struck at two levels below the first coal seam.
