They were either formed as \"The Raiders\" in 1959 when the members were at secondary school, or were one of the first \"manufactured\" bands, the organisers of a band competition at the Palace Hotel in Southend forming a group out of the best musicians in the contest. The Raiders had Robin Trower and Chris Copping (guitars), Mick Trower (lead vocals; older brother of Robin Trower) and Gary Nicholls (drums; born 1945 died April 2007). The initial line-up of the Paramounts from September 1960, was Gary Brooker (piano, ex-Johnny Short and the Coasters), Mick Brownlee (drums; born October 1943, Chiswick, West London died June 2017, ex-Mickey Law and the Outlaws), Chris Copping (bass), Bob Scott (vocals, ex-Bob Scott and the Clansmen) and Robin Trower (guitar). Scott soon left, and Brooker became the vocalist, but as he was only 14, this made playing in licensed premises difficult, so they started performing in Trower's father's cafe, which became The Shades Club.  Copping left in December 1962 and Brownlee left in September 1963, and were replaced by Diz Derrick (bass; born Grahame Derrick, 11 December 1944, Upminster, Essex) and B J Wilson (drums).  Their musical style evolved from their initial R&B towards soul and by 1963 they were regularly playing in London, and were signed by Parlophone. In late 1964 and early 1965 they had Phil Wainman on drums (born Philip Neil Wainman, 7 June 1946, Hampton Court), briefly replaced Wilson who went to Jimmy Powell and the Five Dimensions. Their first single, \"Poison Ivy\", produced by Ron Richards, was a cover of the Leiber and Stoller song, which had been a hit for The Coasters in 1959.  It became a minor hit for the Paramounts, reaching No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart, which led to them appearing on TV shows such as Ready Steady Go!.", "Brooker concentrated on writing music, collaborating with Keith Reid, and Matthew Fisher (organ), and they recorded \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\".
