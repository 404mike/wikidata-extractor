The replay at The Valley also ended in a draw (1\u20131), and with extra time unable to separate the teams, a second replay was required at Villa Park, where goals from Joe Carter, Stan Wood and W. G. Richardson gave Albion a 3\u20131 victory. Wood also scored the only goal of the game in round four against Tottenham Hotspur to set up a fifth round tie with First Division Portsmouth, the only top division side that Albion faced en route to Wembley; W. G. Richardson's goal was enough to give Albion a 1\u20130 victory. The quarter-final stage saw Albion paired with local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, whom they had already beaten both home and away during the league season. After a 1\u20131 draw at The Hawthorns,  Albion won the replay at Molineux 2\u20131, thanks to goals from W. G. Richardson and Stan Wood.McOwan p. 228", "In the second half, after Albion had failed to take several chances, Birmingham equalised. Bradford controlled a long ball, pivoted and shot past Pearson from 25 yards. But the lead did not last. Straight from the restart, Carter, W. G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford took the ball directly down the field. George Liddell sliced his attempted clearance, which left the ball at Richardson's feet, and the forward had an easy task to beat Hibbs from close range.", "|Forward ||Teddy Sandford", "Teddy Sandford, who played on the winning side, is believed to have been the last surviving player from the game when he died in May 1995 at the age of 84."]}, {"page": "1935 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The 1935 FA Cup Final was contested by Sheffield Wednesday and West Bromwich Albion at Wembley. Sheffield Wednesday won 4\u20132, with goals scored by Jack Palethorpe, Mark Hooper and Ellis Rimmer (2). Wally Boyes and Teddy Sandford scored West Brom's goals. It is the most recent time that the trophy has been won by Sheffield Wednesday, and would be their last major trophy win for 56 years, until they won the Football League Cup in 1991.", "West Brom went into the match as favourites even though they were below Wednesday in the table, pundits believing that they had the better forward players with Wally Boyes, W.G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford all having notched over 20 League goals for the season. The two teams had actually met in a League game five days earlier on Easter Monday and drawn 1\u20131 at The Hawthorns. Wednesday went into the match with a full strength squad and fielded the same starting eleven that they had for every round except the third, Ellis Rimmer was their ace in the pack having scored in every round up to the final. West Brom brought back Joe Carter into the team having been absent with a knee injury since the semi-final. Harry Jones being the unlucky player to miss out. In hindsight the decision to play Carter was clearly a gamble and a mistake with no substitutes allowed. Carter was limping after only ten minutes of the match and missed two second half chances which he may have taken if he had been fully fit. Another controversial move by West Brom was the decision to leave out Arthur Gale who had played in all six FA Cup ties leading up to the final that season, scoring four goals from the right wing. Gale was replaced by Tommy Glidden who was effectively shackled by Wednesday's left back Ted Catlin.", "The early stages of the second half saw Ronnie Starling miss a chance and then have another effort cleared off the line. Not to be deterred Starling was prominent in Wednesday re-taking the lead on 70 minutes when his pass released Mark Hooper who beat two men before hitting a shot past Harold Pearson that went in off a post. Within five minutes West Brom were level as a Teddy Sandford shot was deflected into the net off Walt Millership. At this stage West Brom looked the likely winners with some of the Wednesday players arguing amongst themselves as they kicked off. It was during this stage of the game that the limping Joe Carter missed his two good chances, hitting the post with one of them. W. G. Richardson also missed a fine opportunity. With only five minutes remaining and extra time looking a distinct possibility Ellis Rimmer, who had had a quiet match up till that point made his mark on the match. He chased a long through ball from Wilf Sharp and the tall winger got his head to the ball just before West Brom keeper Pearson could reach it and guided it into the net. In the final minute Rimmer scored his second goal when Pearson could only parry a Mark Hooper shot and Rimmer knocked the ball home from close range. Wednesday had won the cup and Ellis Rimmer had scored in every round.\"Sheffield Football, A History\", Keith Farnsworth,  Page 200 (Gives details of match).\"Wednesday\", Keith Farnsworth, pages 132\u2013135 (Gives details of match and team selections).", "| ||10|| Teddy Sandford"]}, {"page": "Edward Sandford", "response": ["#REDIRECTTeddy Sandford"]}, {"page": "1931 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|FW || ||  Teddy Sandford"]}, {"page": "Sandford (surname)", "response": ["* Teddy Sandford (1910\u20131995), English footballer"]}]}}
