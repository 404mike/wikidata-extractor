At the age of seventeen he had already exhibited together with sculptor Lynn Chadwick.After travelling throughout Europe, Carl spent three years visiting countries like Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal in order to widen his perception of the ancient art form. Following the Silk Route and visiting China, Japan (at Kyoto-based Kawai Kanjiro Studios) and Korea, which he claimed as one of the most important regions in ceramic history, much due to its exquisite celadon glazes.\nAfter apprenticeship and dialogues with Bernard Leach, Hans Coper, Lucy Rie, Liu Shengdao (with whom he participated on national Chinese TV), Dong O Anh and Hamada Shoji, Carl developed techniques which would make him notable among the masters of the ceramic arts.\nAfter some years in Denmark, he settled in the village of Algutsboda in southern Sweden, where he lived and worked for over forty years.\nAfter decades of attempts and studies, in the beginning of the 2000s he achieved several sequential firings, producing a peach-coloured very rare glaze exclusively connected with the Chinese Sung Period (960-1279).\nHis work is discussed in the 2001 documentary \u2018MasterPiece - The Art of Carl Cunningham-Cole\u201d by Swedish filmmaker Johan Robach.Although living in Sweden for most of his life, he remained a British citizen.\nHe died in his home in Algutsboda in February 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*6 February \u2013 Carl Cunningham-Cole, ceramic artist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2015", "response": ["*Carl Cunningham-Cole, 72, British ceramic artist.Carl Cunningham-Cole "]}]}}
