Her parents were James Hope-Vere and Lady Elizabeth Hay, and through her mother she was a cousin of Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington. After her marriage to John Loftus, the third Marquess of Ely, she developed friendships with Queen Sophie of the Netherlands and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Jane arrived at court as a Lady of the Bedchamber in 1851, and despite her own nervousness and lack of discretion, she became a close companion of Queen Victoria until her resignation in 1889. Her service was marred by her constant illnesses and fear of the Queen, but she proved a loyal and devoted servant, deferring to her royal mistress in all matters. Jane died on 11 June 1890 and is buried at Kensal Green cemetery in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lady-in-waiting", "response": ["* Jane Loftus, Marchioness of Ely (1821\u20131890)"]}, {"page": "Lady of the Bedchamber", "response": ["*1851\u20131889: Jane Loftus, Marchioness of Ely"]}, {"page": "Lady Ely", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jane Loftus, Marchioness of Ely"]}, {"page": "Jane, Lady Ely", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jane Loftus, Marchioness of Ely"]}, {"page": "Jane Loftus", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jane Loftus, Marchioness of Ely"]}]}}
