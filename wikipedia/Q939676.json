Spencer, his views on race were not likely widely shared in Canada at the time.  While Bengough sympathized with the plight of Canada's native peoples, he condemned the 1885 North-West Rebellion and called for the execution of M\u00e9tis rebel leader Louis Riel, and celebrated Major-General Frederick Dobson Middleton's victory at the Battle of Batoche in Saskatchewan with a poem.  His racial caricatures could, according to Carman Cumming, lead a modern reader to see him as \"a racist chauvinist bigot\": they distort facial features and behaviour in ways typical of cartoons of the era and employ such derogatory terms as \"coon\" for blacks and \"sheeny\" for Jews.  Bengough called for restrictions on Chinese and Irish immigration and his work shows a bias against immigrants who did not conform to Anglo-Saxon Protestant ideals."]}, {"page": "Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan", "response": ["General Frederick Dobson Middleton, who billeted in Qu'Appelle's Queen's Hotel (which survived into the 21st century), made Qu'Appelle the marshalling point to the locus of the North-West Rebellion in the north-west for troops arriving by train from eastern Canada."]}, {"page": "Charles Frederick Houghton", "response": ["After his marriage and a half-year in Europe, Houghton was transferred to Manitoba where he organised the 90th (Winnipeg) Battalion of Rifles.
