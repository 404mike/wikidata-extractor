A second album followed, which was released only in Japan; the group broke up in 1998. Menswear, made up of a new line-up in addition to frontman Johnny Dean, played their first show in 15 years in August 2013.", "The beginnings of the band were a feature in a Select article about a supposed London mod revival led by Graham Coxon. Two individuals closely associated with the burgeoning Britpop scene, Chris Gentry and Johnny Dean, made references to a \"top new unsigned band\" (Menswear), an act which did not yet exist.Harris, John (2003) The Last Party, Harper Perennial, , p. 207-208 They later appeared on the cover of Melody Maker before they had released any material. Their dress sense was Mod (tight-fitting suits etc.) whilst their music was influenced by both Blur's second album Modern Life Is Rubbish and Elastica. Gentry and Dean had a single song - called \"Daydreamer\" - but soon recruited friend Simon White, who contributed \"I'll Manage Somehow\" to add to the setlist necessary for their upcoming debut gig at a Britpop-oriented club on Regent Street called Smashing. The music press reviewed their performance enthusiastically, with NME comparing them to a \"Tarantino film... totally derivative but totally brilliant\", increasing the record labels' interest.", "The band parted company with Laurel in 1997, after delivering their country-rock-tinged second album Hay Tiempo!.
