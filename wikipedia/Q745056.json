After four years with the club, he rejected a new contract and signed for Nottingham Forest on a free transfer. He made over 150 appearances for Forest in four years there, and helped them win promotion to the Championship in his final season. He then moved to Derby, again on a free transfer. Injury problems curtailed his goalscoring in his first two years there, but in his final season there he had scored 13 goals by the time of the mid-season transfer window.\nIn January 2011, Commons moved to Celtic for \u00a33,000,000. He went on to win five Scottish League Championships, two Scottish Cups and one Scottish League Cup. He was the top goalscorer in Scotland in season 2013\u201314 with 32 goals, and that same season won both the PFA Scotland and Scottish Football Writers' Association Player of the Year awards.

Two days later, Enckelman agreed to join the club, signing a two-year deal. Enckleman made his debut for the club in a 1\u20131 draw against Hearts on 14 August 2010. At St Johnstone, Enckleman immediately became a first choice goalkeeper. At the beginning of the season, Enckelman made a bad start and was relegated to the substitution bench after two matches. In his first season, Enckelman faced competition from Graeme Smith to take the first choice. In the end, Enckelman managed to win the spot. Despite the following season when Smith left and Alan Mannus arrived, Enckelman managed to retain his first choice throughout the season. Enckelman made an impressive penalty save from Kris Commons and won 1\u20130 against Celtic, keeping a clean sheet on 22 August 2011. After the match, Enckelman said the game was his best match. He saved another penalty from Jamie Hamill in a 2\u20131 win at Hearts on 3 December 2011. After the 2011/12 season, Enckelman was released by the club after his contract expired. After his release, Enckelman went on a trial at Preston and played in a friendly match in a 2\u20130 win over Southport on 14 July 2012."]}]}}
