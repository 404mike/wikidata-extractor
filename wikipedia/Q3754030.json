This early 20th-century work is his most prominent, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory. The most famous example of this is the \"episode of the madeleine\", which occurs early in the first volume. The novel gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a literal rendering of the French, became ascendant after D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992.", "The first six volumes were first translated into English by the Scotsman C. K. Scott Moncrieff  under the title Remembrance of Things Past, a phrase taken from Shakespeare's Sonnet 30; this was the first translation of the Recherche into another language. The individual volumes were Swann's Way, in two books (1922), Within a Budding Grove, in two books (1924), The Guermantes Way, in two books (1925), Cities of the Plain, in two books (1927), The Captive (1929), and The Sweet Cheat Gone (1930). The final volume, Le Temps retrouv\u00e9, was initially published in English in the UK as Time Regained (1931), translated by Stephen Hudson (a pseudonym of Sydney Schiff), and in the US as The Past Recaptured (1932) in a translation by Frederick Blossom. There were thus eleven books in the original English translation. Although cordial with Scott Moncrieff, Proust grudgingly remarked in a letter that Remembrance eliminated the correspondence between Temps perdu and Temps retrouv\u00e9 (Painter, 352). Terence Kilmartin revised the Scott Moncrieff translation in 1981, using the new French edition of 1954. An additional revision by D. J. Enright\u2014that is, a revision of a revision\u2014was published by the Modern Library in 1992. It is based on the \"La Pl\u00e9iade\" edition of the French text (1987\u201389), and rendered the title of the novel more literally as In Search of Lost Time."]}, {"page": "School and university in literature", "response": ["* D.
