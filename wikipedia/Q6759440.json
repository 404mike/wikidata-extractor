She served as President of the English Place-Name Society from 1986 to 1998, and Vice-President of the International Council of Onomastic Sciences from 1993 to 1999, as well as being a Fellow of St Hilda's College, Oxford, She was an elected fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the British Academy.\nBorn in Manchester and raised in Kent, she studied at St Hilda's College, becoming involved in socialist activism. She proceeded to work for the English Place-Name Society from 1946 to 1953, focusing her research on the place-names of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. Marrying archaeologist Peter Gelling of the University of Birmingham in 1952, she moved to Harborne in Birmingham while undertaking her PhD research into the place-names of West Berkshire. Lecturing on the subject across the Midlands, she published her research in a series of books, achieving prominence within academia for her 1978 work Signposts to the Past: The Geographical Roots of Britain's Place-names. In the coming decades she focused on researching the place-names of Shropshire, resulting in a multi-volume publication, earning a number of awards and prominent appointments for her life's work.\nGelling's work focused on establishing the Old English origins of English place-names in the Midlands, and her approach sought to connect toponyms to geographical features in the landscape.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St Hilda's College, Oxford", "response": ["* Margaret Gelling, toponymist"]}, {"page": "Toponymy", "response": ["*Margaret Gelling (1924-2009), English toponymist"]}, {"page": "Heorot", "response": ["An alternative theory was proposed in 1998 by the archaeologist Paul Wilkinson. He suggested that Heorot was at Harty on the Isle of Sheppey; Harty was indeed named Heorot in Saxon times. He suggests that the steep shining sea-cliffs of Beowulf would match the pale cliffs of Sheerness on that island, its name meaning \"bright headland\". An inlet near Harty is named \"Land's End\", like Beowulf's landing-place on the way to Heorot. The sea-journey from the Rhine to Kent could take the day and a half mentioned in the poem. The road to Heorot is described as a straet, a Roman Road, of which there are none in Scandinavia, but one leads across the Isle of Harty to a Roman settlement, possibly a villa. The toponymist Margaret Gelling observed that the description in Beowulf of Heorot as having a fagne flor, a shining or coloured floor, could \"denote the paved or tessellated floor of a Roman building\". Finally, the surrounding area was named Schrawynghop in the Middle Ages, schrawa meaning \"demons\" and hop meaning \"land enclosed by marshes\", suggestive of Grendel's lonely fens in the poem. The archaeologist Paul Budden found the theory risible, even if \"the story appealed\" to him as a Kentish man; he noted that Wilkinson conceded that the subject was \"mythology, not archaeology or science\"."]}, {"page": "English Place-Name Society", "response": ["In 1929 Professor Mawer was appointed Provost of University College, London and the Society moved there at the end of the year.

It is hard to see the river in dramatic terms. Undoubtedly it has a history of flooding and can rise quickly after rain, but it is unlikely that anyone familiar with the Severn, into which it flows, could see the Stour as embodying raw power or turbulence.

However, this ridge is not actually very prominent and few visitors would perceive Penkridge as a hill town. Modern toponymists have become convinced that the hill in question was more likely a tumulus\u2014prominent in pre-Roman and Roman times, and perhaps much later. Brewer comments that \"none is evident in the locality\". However, Margaret Gelling, predisposed to find direct evidence for toponyms in the local landscape, has proposed a precise location for the mound, now destroyed by ploughing, that gave both the town and, ultimately, the river their names.Gelling, Margaret (1984) Place-Names in the Landscape. London: J. M. Dent , p. 138 This was a tumulus at Rowley Hill Farm, Ordnance Survey reference GR90251180, approximately , which was still prominent in the 18th century and still discernible in the early 20th. It would have directly overlooked the outlying Roman camp, across the Penk and just north of Pennocrucium on Watling Street, the remains of which are clearly visible in satellite photographs. Certainly, it makes more sense to look for the hill in question in the immediate vicinity of the ancient settlement than that of the modern town, which is well to the north of it. The Rowley Hill tumulus is well documented, and was clearly an extremely important landmark for several millennia."]}, {"page": "Place name origins", "response": ["Topographical names were held in low esteem by early place name scholars but their importance was raised in a book by Margaret Gelling, first published in 1978.

Dent , p. 129 It appears in various combinations, but sometimes on its own, as in Bray. Margaret Gelling, a specialist in West Midland toponyms, suggested that it was often misunderstood by the Anglo-Saxons as a name rather than as a common noun. So they thought they had come upon a place called by the natives Brig or Bre, rather than simply a hill. This is why the word is often combined tautologically, as in Bredon Hill, where all three elements have the same meaning."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Saxon paganism", "response": ["Old English place-names also provide some insight into the pre-Christian beliefs and practices of Anglo-Saxon England. Some of these place-names reference the names of particular deities, while others use terms that refer to cultic practices that took place there. In England, these two categories remain separate, unlike in Scandinavia, where certain place-names exhibit both features. Those place-names which carry possible pagan associations are centred primarily in the centre and south-east of England, while no obvious examples are known from Northumbria or East Anglia. It is not clear why such names are rarer or non-existent in certain parts of the country; it may be due to changes in nomenclature brought about by Scandinavian settlement in the Late Anglo-Saxon period or because of evangelising efforts by later Christian authorities. In 1941, Stenton suggested that \"between fifty and sixty sites of heathen worship\" could by identified through the place-name evidence, although in 1961 the place-name scholar Margaret Gelling cautioned that only forty-five of these appeared reliable. The literature specialist Philip A. Shaw has however warned that many of these sites might not have been named by pagans but by later Christian Anglo-Saxons, reflecting spaces that were perceived to be heathen from a Christian perspective.", "It has been suggested that Woden was also known as Grim \u2013 a name which appears in such English place-names as Grimspound in Dartmoor, Grimes Graves in Norfolk and Grimsby (\"Grim's Village\") in Lincolnshire \u2013 because in recorded Norse mythology, the god \u00d3\u00f0inn is also known as Gr\u00edmnir. Highlighting that there are around twice as many Grim place-names in England as Woden place-names, the place-name scholar Margaret Gelling cautioned against the view that Grim was always associated with Woden in Anglo-Saxon England."]}, {"page": "Badger, Shropshire", "response": ["Badger has its origin in the Old English language of the Anglo-Saxons.
