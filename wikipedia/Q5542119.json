On the one hand, he argued that his faith drove him to defend the \"Protestant people of Ulster\", while at the same time, he conceded that the cold-blooded murder of non-combatant civilians would ensure his damnation.

The West Belfast Brigade would later reference Wright as a true loyalist who had been a victim of the UVF in a leaflet circulated to foment a feud between the UDA and the UVF. Despite this, the two men had had a fractured relationship during Wright's life and according to Adair's sometime girlfriend Jackie \"Legs\" Robinson, Adair had told her that Wright was a \"bastard\" when the UVF leader attended a party at Robinson's house.

Adair by this time had forged close links with the dissident LVF, a breakaway group to which the UVF was ardently opposed.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 323 Amidst an atmosphere of increasing tension in the area, Adair decided to host a \"Loyalist Day of Culture\" on the Shankill on Saturday 19 August 2000, which saw thousands of UDA members from across Northern Ireland descend on his Lower Shankill stronghold, where a series of newly commissioned murals were officially unveiled on a day which also featured a huge UDA/UFF parade and armed UDA/UFF show of strength. The UVF leadership had sought and been given assurances that no LVF regalia would be displayed on the Shankill on the day of the procession. However, and unknown to the UDA beyond its \"C Company\", Adair had an LVF flag delivered to the Lower Shankill on the morning of the celebrations.

Adair waited until the bulk of the parade of UDA men had made its way up into the heart of the Shankill before initiating the provocative gesture. Violence broke out between UVF men who had been standing outside the Rex watching the procession and the group involved in unfurling the contentious flag, which had been discreetly concealed near the tail end of the parade. Prior to this the atmosphere at the Rex had been jovial, with the UVF spectators even joining in to sing UDA songs along to the tunes of the UDA-aligned flute bands which accompanied the approximately ten thousand UDA men on their parade up the Shankill Road. But vicious fighting ensued, with a roughly three hundred-strong C Company (the name given to the Lower Shankill unit of the UDA's West Belfast Brigade, which contained Adair's most loyal men) mob attacking the patrons of the Rex, initially with hand weapons such as bats and iron bars, before they shot up the bar as its patrons barricaded themselves inside. Also shot up was the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) headquarters which faced the pub. C Company then went on the rampage in the Lower Shankill, attacking the houses of known UVF members and their families, including the home of veteran UVF leader Gusty Spence, and evicting the inhabitants at gunpoint as they wrecked and stole property and set fire to homes. By the end of the day nearly all those with UVF associations had been driven from the Lower Shankill.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 325-327 Later that night, C Company gunmen shot up the Rex again, this time from a passing car.
