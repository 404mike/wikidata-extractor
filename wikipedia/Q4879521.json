One of the first was Mrs Rundell's A New System of Domestic Cookery, 1806; it went through sixty-seven editions by 1844, selling hundreds of thousands of copies in Britain and America. This was followed by Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families 1845, which Bee Wilson has called \"the greatest cookery book in our language\", but \"modern\" only in a nineteenth-century sense."]}, {"page": "Isabella Beeton", "response": ["The Book of Household Management has been edited, revised and enlarged several times since Beeton's death and is still in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Beeton's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.", "Beeton and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are \"sometimes slapdash and misleading\", although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagn\u00e9's Larousse Gastronomique also contains errors. The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled \"how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse\u00a0... [Acton's] superior work\", while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that \"It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for.\" In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Beeton's work was only a \"fashionable\" stance to take and that the cook's writing \"simply makes you want to cook\". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the \"relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930\" may instead be explained by the \"progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers\". David comments that \"when plain English cooks\" were active in their kitchens, \"they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives\". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a \"fascinating source of information\" from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be \"the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era\"."]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["The shortlist of six titles was announced on 15 October 2020.

Bee Wilson, in an article for The Daily Telegraph, critiqued \"Hollywood marriages\" for often being based on the unrealistic dreams of what she termed \"permanent children\", although she points to some classic Hollywood couples, like Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart or Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, as exceptions to these criticisms.
