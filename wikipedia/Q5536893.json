He played club level rugby union (RU) for Weston-super-Mare RFC, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Wales, and at club level for Wigan, Bradford Northern and Castleford (Heritage \u2116 260 as a wartime guest) as a centre, stand-off, or scrum-half, i.e. number 3 or 4, 6, or 7.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wales national rugby league team", "response": ["The 1930s were to herald a new era for the team as it emerged at times as one of the dominant sides in world rugby league. In 1930 and 1933 Wales played Australia at Wembley Stadium in London. On both occasions they failed to win, losing 26\u201310 and being thrashed 51\u201319. However at the time Australia were arguably considered the world's second best nation (behind England) and so particularly in the first game, Wales had done very well against the touring Kangaroos. Wales luck against England did not change either suffering three losses to the Lions in three games, in Huddersfield, Salford and Leeds. They were very unlucky in the latter however, with England winning 14 points to 13. Exactly 27 years after Wales played their first match, they played France for the first time in a new competition called the European Nations Cup, in which Wales, France and England would play two matches each. Wales and France kicked off the tournament on New Year's Day in front of 15,000 in Bordeaux. But the Dragons lost 18\u201311, and their match against England was just as bad losing 24\u201311 in Liverpool. The France versus England match finished a 15\u201315 draw so England won the inaugural competition on points difference. Wales finished bottom. The next European Nations Cup brought better fortunes to the Welsh and they kicked off the competition, which was staged across Winter 1935 and 1936, with a 41\u20137 thrashing against France. The team were cheered on by 25,000 people at Llanelli and three months later Wales did the unexpected and squeezed past England, winning 14\u201317 away at Hull. This was a huge result for Wales, having not beaten England since 1923, and they had won the cup for the first time. For the next two competitions Wales successfully defended the cup. A 3\u20132 win against the English in Pontypridd, coupled with a 9\u20133 victory in Paris saw Wales clinch the cup for the second time, and then in 1938 the Dragons beat England again by one point in Bradford before beating the French 18\u20132. This represents perhaps the highest point in Welsh rugby league history with great players such as Jim Sullivan, Gus Risman, Alan Edwards and Alec Givvons featuring. In 1935 Welsh rugby league would produce its first black international in George Bennett (some 48 years before Welsh rugby union would do so). In the 1938/1939 tournament, the last to be held for six years because of the Second World War, Wales beat their main rivals England before dramatically losing 16\u201310 in Bordeaux against Les Tricolores. Because of the French's victory against England, Wales finished second and the cup was taken across the channel."]}, {"page": "Rugby league in England", "response": ["Rugby league has had a tradition of being inclusive and for some notable firsts in terms of black participation. Professional black players first took to the professional rugby league pitch prior to the First World War. George Bennett became the first black player to play for Great Britain while it was another 44 years before Viv Anderson became the first black footballer to play association football for England. Clive Sullivan became the first black captain of the Great Britain team in 1972, 21 years before Paul Ince became the first black captain of England's association football team. Roy Francis was the first black coach of a leading club, almost half a century before the top flight of English association football would have a black British manager, a milestone also achieved by Ince (on 22 June 2008). Ellery Hanley earned the distinction of being the first black coach of any British national sporting team when he took charge of Great Britain in the home Ashes series of 1994."]}, {"page": "George Bennett", "response": ["George Bennett or Bennet may refer to:", "*George Bennett (Australian rules footballer) (1911\u20131974), Australian professional football player", "*George Bennett (cricketer, born 1829) (1829\u20131886), English cricketer", "*George Bennett (cricketer, born 1832) (1832\u20131913), English cricketer", "*George Bennett (cricketer, born 1883) (1883\u20131966), English cricketer, British Army officer and solicitor", "*George Bennett (Australian cricketer) (1906\u20131983), Australian cricketer", "*George Bennett (cyclist) (born 1990), New Zealand road cyclist", "*George Bennett (rugby) (1913\u20131970), Welsh rugby union and rugby league player", "*George Bennett (Ontario politician) (1888\u20131948), Canadian politician, Mayor of Windsor", "*George Bennett (Wisconsin politician), Wisconsin state senator from Kenosha", "*George Bennett (bishop) (1875\u20131946), Roman Catholic Bishop of Aberdeen", "*George Bennet (hebraist) (1750\u20131835), English Hebraist", "*George Bennet (missionary) (1774\u20131841), English-born Christian missionary to India and Far East countries", "*George Bennett (murderer) (died 1880), Canadian who was executed for the murder of George Brown", "*George Bennett (naturalist) (1804\u20131893), English-born Australian physician and naturalist", "*George Bennet (pastoralist) (1870\u20131928), pastoralist and racehorse owner in South Australia", "*George Bennett House, historic house near Harrison, Ohio in the United States", "*George Bennet, 7th Earl of Tankerville (1852\u20131931), British peer, cowpuncher, circus clown, and revival meeting singer", "*George Bennett (admiral) (1926\u20131996), Australian admiral", "*George Bennett, who proved Bennett's inequality in probability theory at the University of New South Wales in 1962", "*George Bennet, 1st Baronet (died  1700), of the Bennet baronets"]}, {"page": "Weston-super-Mare RFC", "response": ["*  (RL) 1935 George Bennett"]}, {"page": "George Bennett (rugby league)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Bennett (rugby)"]}, {"page": "List of Wigan Warriors internationals", "response": ["* George Bennett won caps for Wales while at Wigan 1935\u20261936 3-caps"]}, {"page": "1934\u201335 Lancashire Cup", "response": ["|||4||George Bennett", "|||T||George Bennett"]}, {"page": "1945\u201346 Yorkshire Cup", "response": ["|George Bennett||6||Ronald \"Ron\" Rylance"]}]}}
