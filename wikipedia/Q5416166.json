Lee had a solo single to his name and was a budding songwriter. Stevens had been classically trained, but had since adapted her vocals and was performing as a cabaret singer. The trio began recording together, but their first single, \"Rock Me Baby\", to be released at the end of 1972, was cancelled due to the release of the song by David Cassidy. Finally their first two singles \"Happy Ever After\" and \"Our World of Love\" were released in 1973. Neither single charted and soon after, another female vocalist was added to the line up, Sandra Stevens. Stevens (no relation to Nicky) had been performing as a big-band singer since a teenager in the late 1960s. She had sung with the Joe Loss big band and alongside Eve Graham (of The New Seekers) in club group, The Nocturnes."]}, {"page": "The New Seekers", "response": ["The group was formed after the disbanding of the successful 1960s Australian group the Seekers. Keith Potger, a member of the Seekers, put together the New Seekers in 1969, featuring Laurie Heath, Chris Barrington, Marty Kristian, and Eve Graham and Sally Graham (no relation), the latter of whom was a member of The Young Generation. Potger himself also performed and recorded with the group. Despite only having released one album with no commercial success, ITV's Scottish Television gave the group their own TV series Finders, Seekers. The line up for this version of the group hosting the series was Keith Potger, Eve Graham, Sally Graham, Laurie Heath, Marty Kristian and Chris Barrington. Produced in colour the show was given a prime-time slot, starting on March 27, 1970 (Good Friday) and continuing for seven shows. The public did not take to the show, with several complaints seemingly targeted at the band. Despite the complaints, the series was shown on several ITV channels, sold to Canada, Australia and Sweden with interest from other countries as a result of being shown at the international television market in Cannes. Following the series failure, later in 1970, after one album release, the line-up was reworked to comprise Eve Graham, Lyn Paul, Marty Kristian, Peter Doyle, and Paul Layton. This line-up found instant success with their debut release, a cover of Melanie Safka's \"What Have They Done to My Song, Ma\" (titled in the U.S. as \"Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma\"US Elektra Records release, #45699), which became a top 20 hit in the US, No. 3 in Canada, and a minor one in the UK.", "Up to now, the group's biggest success had been as a five-piece harmony, but it was around this time that they began to favour lead singers for their songs with title credits given to Marty Kristian for \"Come Softly to Me\" and Eve Graham for \"Nevertheless\", but it was in late 1973 that this formula found its biggest success when Lyn Paul took the lead on the new single, \"You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me\". The song became a big hit over Christmas and eventually peaked at No. 1 in January 1974, becoming their second biggest hit. This formula continued with the next single, \"I Get a Little Sentimental Over You\", which also became a big hit, peaking at No. 5. However, despite this revival, the group announced their split amid much publicity. With allegations that the members were receiving little financial reward for their success, The New Seekers officially disbanded in May 1974.", "In 1976, the New Seekers reformed with Kathy Ann Rae and Danny Finn replacing Lyn Paul and Peter Oliver. Although they never replicated their earlier success, signed to CBS (Columbia in the US) the group did manage to score a few hits with It's So Nice (To Have You Home) (1976), I Wanna Go Back (1977) and Anthem (One Day in Every Week) (1978). This line up remained intact until 1978, when Danny Finn and Eve Graham left the group to marry. Their final single for CBS was Don't Stop The Music in 1979, with Kathy Ann Rae on lead vocal, but after it failed to chart, she left the band and the group signed their final contract with EMI. In 1980, the group attempted to represent the UK again in the Eurovision Song Contest with the song Tell Me, but it was disqualified shortly before the British heats were televised due to the fact the group had already performed the song on TV a year earlier. Had they appeared in the 1980 UK contest, the group would have been up against former member Danny Finn, who was the lead singer of the winning group Prima Donna. In addition, Mick Flinn and Donna Jones of the final New Seekers line-up (2010) were also in the contest, placing fourth under the group name Pussyfoot. Marty Kristian entered a song in the 1983 UK Eurovision finals, performed by a trio called 'Audio', which included Kathy Ann Rae in the line up. Since then, there have been personnel changes which included Caitriona Walsh, Nicola Kerr and Vikki James (Grammy Winner Victoria Horn). Paul Layton remained with the band throughout this time.
