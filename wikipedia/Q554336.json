On transfer deadline day during the January transfer window, it was reported Tyler had been approached by Peterborough about a return to the club as cover for Ben Alnwick. However, a transfer failed to materialise, with Tyler claiming Luton had \"pulled the plug\" on the move, a claim manager Nathan Jones denied, stating no official deadline day approach was made. However, Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony later clarified the situation, claiming that Jones was \"misinformed\" and in fact an approach was made for Tyler's services, but was turned down by Luton. Tyler was recalled to the first-team in a 2\u20131 win over Hartlepool United on 20 February 2016. He made two further appearances in a 3\u20132 win over York City on 27 February 2016, followed by a 1\u20130 win over Morecambe on 1 March 2016. However, Tyler's situation changed once more when it was revealed a re-occurrence of his back injury would keep him out for the rest of the season, as talks with Peterborough resumed about a potential return. This led to Derby County goalkeeper Jonathan Mitchell being brought in on loan until the end of the season as Tyler's replacement.

The ramshackle nature of the United defence showed as Tottenham took an early lead through a glancing header from Roman Pavlyuchenko. However, United soon took the initiative back as Carlos Tevez rattled the bar before forcing Spurs 'keeper Ben Alnwick into a reflex save, while Danny Welbeck was only denied by a last-ditch block from Chris Gunter after dancing past three defenders. The score was turned on its head shortly after the half-hour mark, when the home side hit a two-goal salvo in as many minutes. In the 35th minute, Michael Carrick pulled the ball back to Paul Scholes on the edge of the box from a corner, and the midfielder's shot was deflected off Tom Huddlestone past a flat-footed Ben Alnwick. Then, a minute later, Carrick was the provider for United's second goal as he played Berbatov through the middle and the Bulgarian fired past Alnwick from the edge of the area. Early in the second half, United lost F\u00e1bio to injury and he was replaced by fellow debutant Richard Eckersley.
