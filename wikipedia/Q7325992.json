Executive producers Tony Tenser and Michael Klinger threatened to take over production as they did not want to increase the budget. Since Croydon had hired Curteis, it became his responsibility to fire him and finish directing the film. Richard Gordon suggested that \"I think Curteis was relieved to step out because he simply didn't know any longer what to do.\" Croydon was not credited for his directing work on the film; as Gordon said, \"one tries not to publicize such incidents.\"", "The Projected Man was shot at the same time as Island of Terror, with which it was released on a double bill. The idea of the double bill came to Richard Gordon when he ran Island of Terror for Universal Studios' executive in charge, Hi Martin. As The Projected Man's special effects were not yet finished, Gordon showed Martin Island of Terror. Martin enjoyed the film and obtained the American rights for a \"very large sum of money.\" As Gordon was not keen on the idea of Island of Terror being placed at the bottom of the bill with one of Universal's other features, which he described as \"no good for [our production company] financially,\" he proposed adding a second film, noting that The Projected Man was nearing completion. He showed an unfinished workprint of the film to see if Martin was interested, and he enjoyed it enough to accept the deal. When The Projected Man was shown in theatres in the United States, it was cut thirteen minutes shorter than the original British print, due to the fact that Universal felt the opening scene, which depicted a rehearsal for an experiment which came later in the film, was \"repetitive.\" They also did not want a double bill with a duration of over three hours, and did not want to edit Island of Terror, so The Projected Man was trimmed to provide an exact 180-minute running time.", "Many reviews were critical of the film's resemblance to The Fly.
