In a videotape recorded by Settelen in 1992, Diana said that in 1984 through to 1986, she had been \"deeply in love with someone who worked in this environment.\" It is thought she was referring to Barry Mannakee, who was transferred to the Diplomatic Protection Squad in 1986 after his managers had determined that his relationship with Diana had been inappropriate. Diana said in the tape that Mannakee had been \"chucked out\" from his role as her bodyguard following suspicion that the two were having an affair. Penny Junor suggested in her 1998 book that Diana was in a romantic relationship with Mannakee. Diana's friends dismissed the claim as absurd. In the subsequently released tapes, Diana said she had feelings for that \"someone\", saying \"I was quite happy to give all this up [and] just to go off and live with him\". She described him as \"the greatest friend [she's] ever had\", though she denied any sexual relationship with him. She also spoke bitterly of her husband saying that \"[He] made me feel so inadequate in every possible way, that each time I came up for air he pushed me down again.\""]}, {"page": "British royal family", "response": ["Royal biographer Penny Junor says that the royal family has presented itself \"as the model family\" since the 1930s. Author Edward Owen wrote that during World War II, the monarchy sought an image of a \"more informal and vulnerable family\" that had a unifying effect on the nation during instability. In 1992, the Princess Royal and her husband Mark Phillips divorced; the Prince and Princess of Wales separated; a biography detailing the Princess's bulimia and self-harming was published; her private telephone conversations surfaced, as did the Prince's intimate telephone conversations with his lover, Camilla Parker Bowles; the Duke and Duchess of York separated; and photographs of the topless Duchess having her toes sucked by another man appeared in tabloids. Historian Robert Lacey said that this \"put paid to any claim to being a model of family life\". The scandals contributed to the public's unwillingness to pay for the repairs of the Windsor Castle after the 1992 fire. A further \"PR disaster\" was the royal family's initial response to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997."]}, {"page": "Prince Andrew, Duke of York", "response": ["In August 2020, anti-child trafficking protesters chanting \"Paedophile!

I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture \u2013 you remember: 'every time I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver.'

The Prince of Wales has a great sense of history and a lot of that comes from his mother\".

Writing in The Guardian, Simon Jenkins described the season as \"fake history\", \"reality hijacked as propaganda, and a cowardly abuse of artistic licence\" which fabricated history to suit its own preconceived narrative. The season has reportedly received backlash from the British royal family and some royal commentators. Royal historian Hugo Vickers stated: \"In this particular series, every member of the royal family...comes out of it badly, except the Princess of Wales (Diana). It's totally one sided, it's totally against Prince Charles\".

On 20 January 2020, royal biographer Penny Junor also told The New York Times that \"The family is trying to prevent a half-in, half-out arrangement, which doesn't work\".  On 22 January, The Guardian published a cartoon by illustrator Andrzej Krauze, titled \"Brexit and Megxit\", saying \"The rest of the EU is mesmerised as the UK prepares for Brexit \u2013 and Harry and Meghan begin their transition to exiting the royal family\"."]}]}}
