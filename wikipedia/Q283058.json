He is a previous holder of the 10, 25, 30, 50 and 100-mile competition records.\nHe has made two unsuccessful attempts at the hour record, the first of which forms the basis of his 2006 book The Hour, which gained him the award for Best New Writer at the 2007 British Sports Book Awards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Team time trial", "response": ["Unique to the UK the Grand Prix des Gentlemen is a very special event, and rather unique for a two-up time trial. First held in 1970 and based on the Parisian cycle race 'Gentlemen \u00e0 Aulnay'.  The teams of two must include a veteran rider (over the age of 40), who is classed as the \u2018Gentleman\u2019, the other rider being the pacer. The Gentleman isn\u2019t allowed to pass the pacer until 200 yards from the finish line. This is a challenging event and often has the older rider making every effort to hold the pace line to save energy and ensure he can contribute for the final pull. In the past riders such as Chris Boardman, Bradley Wiggins and Michael Hutchinson have raced the event as the pacer, while Tour de France rider Sean Yates has been the pacer as well as the 'Gentleman'."]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Michael Hutchinson"]}, {"page": "List of non-professional marathon runners", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Hutchinson\"|Michael Hutchinson||sports||cycling||2017||London Marathon ||3:01:22||||"]}, {"page": "Cycling Weekly", "response": ["Alan Gayfer left Cycling in 1969 to work for the United Press news agency on the other side of Fleet Street, London, where Cycling then had its offices. There he could also report his other love: boxing. He died of a heart attack while cycling in Canada after retirement. Gayfer was succeeded by Ken Evans, whose interest in short-distance time-trialling led to a parallel competition to the British Best All-Rounder: the Campagnolo Trophy for races over 25 miles (40\u00a0km). It lasted only two seasons before it was considered not worth the effort and expense. Evans resigned to work with the components wholesaler, Ron Kitching.cited Breckon, Michael (1993), A Wheel in two Worlds, the Ron Kitching Story, p227 Evans was replaced by Martin Ayres. He in turn was followed by Andrew Sutcliffe, who had been editor of Cycle Trader. Under Sutcliffe the magazine took on a stronger pictorial content and reporting of domestic cycling, especially where it didn't concern racing, was lessened in favour of coverage of continental racing. Sutcliffe left to help form a company called Cabal Communications, run by other former IPC staff. Cabal introduced a monthly magazine called Procycling as a rival to IPC's own monthly publication, Cycle Sport. Its first editor was William Fotheringham, who had also been on IPC's staff. Sutcliffe's replacement was Robert Garbutt, who is the current editor. Significant members of staff have included Sid Saltmarsh \u2013 deputy editor under Alan Gayfer \u2013 who worked formerly for the News Chronicle and the BBC and who was reporting the Tour de France when the English rider Tom Simpson died during the race in 1967.
