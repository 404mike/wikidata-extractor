AFC Wimbledon physiotherapist, Mike Rayner, confirmed later that day that an X-Ray had shown that Prior had broken both his tibia and his fibula which would prevent him playing again for over nine months. After a long recuperation, Prior was finally able to make his return to league football on 29 December 2012, in a 3\u20130 defeat at home to Oxford United.
