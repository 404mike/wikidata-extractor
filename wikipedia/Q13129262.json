He won a scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford, before becoming a solicitor working for Denbighshire County Council.  He became active in Plaid Cymru, and stood unsuccessfully in Conway at the 1955 and 1959 general elections, then in Merthyr Tydfil in 1964.Rees worked for local government in Lancashire, Cardiff and Pembrokeshire before returning to Gwynedd, where he was Chief Executive from 1974 until 1991.  An advocate of localism and environmentalism, he wrote Government by Community as a critique of the planned changes to local government enacted in the Local Government Act 1972; this won the Royal Institute of Public Administration's Haldane Medal.\nLater in life, Rees compiled an anthology, The Mountains of Wales, and he became a druid of the Gorsedd in recognition of his Welsh-language poetry.

He has a brother and a sister; his father was Ioan Bowen Rees (13 January 1929 \u2013 4 May 1999), a \"poet, essayist, polemicist, mountaineer, internationalist ... and a White Robe Druid of the Gorsedd of Bards\". Bowen Rees \"campaigned all his life for Welsh rights, language and culture\" although he did not believe in the narrow view of nationalism, glorifying one country over another, rather that the \"battle for Wales is the battle for all small nations, all small communities, all individuals in the age of genocide\". Rhys's mother, Margaret Wynn Meredith, shared his father's love of writing and was a poet."]}, {"page": "Clough Williams-Ellis", "response": ["Clough Williams-Ellis was born in Gayton, Northamptonshire, England, but his family moved back to his father's native North Wales when he was four.
