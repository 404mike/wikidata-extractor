The idea was that when the batsman defended against the ball, he would be likely to deflect the ball into the air for a catch."]}, {"page": "Bodyline", "response": ["Jardine was appointed captain of England for the 1931 season, replacing Percy Chapman who had led the team in 1930.

Iremonger was much more positive, assuring Larwood that his bowling required only fine tuning.Hamilton, pp. 43\u201344 Larwood had also gained the support of the county captain, Arthur Carr, a powerful personality who decided that the new recruit had the makings of a future Test match bowler. \"The best way to deal with him\", Carr said later, \"was as if he was my own son\".Hamilton, p. 58 Carr played a major part in encouraging and developing the young bowler's talents, and acted as Larwood's guiding spirit throughout the latter's career."]}, {"page": "1922 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Arthur Carr, Tich Freeman, Charlie Parker, Jack Russell, Andy Sandham"]}, {"page": "Jack Hobbs", "response": ["Hobbs was given a third benefit by Surrey in 1926 which raised \u00a32,670.McKinstry, p. 268.

Hobbs began the season well,McKinstry, p. 270. and after the first Test, which was badly affected by rain, he remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University, sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham; this remained a Surrey first wicket record as of 2016.McKinstry, pp. 270\u201371. In the drawn second Test, he and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182. Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings, leading to accusations that he was more concerned with reaching three figures than batting for the team.McKinstry, pp. 271\u201372.

England followed on in the face of a large Australian total, but Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the second innings with a partnership of 156 and Hobbs scored 88 as the game was saved.McKinstry, pp. 273\u201375.

Jardine explained his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring to one side of the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. Jardine asked Larwood and Voce if they could bowl accurately on leg stump and make the ball rise up into the body of the batsman. The bowlers agreed that they could, and that it might prove effective, but Jardine stressed that bowling accurately was vitally important, or Bradman would dominate the bowling. Larwood believed that Jardine saw Bradman as his main target and wished to attack him psychologically as well as in a cricketing sense. At the same time, other Australian batsmen were also discussed.Hamilton, pp. 130\u201331.Frith, pp. 43\u201344. Larwood and Voce practised the plan over the remainder of the 1932 season with mixed success.Frith, pp. 45\u201348.Douglas, pp. 113\u201317. Jardine also visited Frank Foster who had toured Australia in 1911\u201312 to discuss field placings appropriate to Australian conditions. Foster had bowled leg theory on that tour with his fielders placed close in on the leg-side, as had George Hirst in 1903\u201304.Frith, pp. 18\u201319. During the second half of the season, the team to tour Australia was announced. The selection of four fast bowlers and a few medium pacers was very unusual at the time, and it was commented on by the hosts' media, including Bradman.Frith, pp. 54\u201355. The selection of Eddie Paynter, who did not have a strong record, to replace the ill Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji was very likely a choice of Jardine. He had a history of good performances against Yorkshire, and Jardine considered that a player's record against northern counties was a good indication of his potential at international level.Douglas, pp. 105, 120\u201321."]}, {"page": "Bill Voce", "response": ["He was selected for the English tour of the West Indies and made his Test debut in the first Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, on 11 January 1930. However, the hard wicket encouraged him to move to a faster style, and he had so much success that he persisted with the faster method when he returned to England, except on wet pitches. He did not do particularly well as a pace bowler in 1930, but following Australia's tour of England in that summer, when Don Bradman scored freely against the English bowling, Voce was part of a meeting convened between the future English captain, Douglas Jardine, and Nottinghamshire captain, Arthur Carr, to come up with a tactic to defeat Bradman and the Australians. Voce, and his fellow Nottinghamshire fast bowler, Harold Larwood, agreed to a suggestion by Jardine that bowling fast rising balls into the batsmen's bodies, with several catching fielders on the leg side would be an effective tactic."]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| rowspan=3 | Arthur Carr100px"]}]}}
