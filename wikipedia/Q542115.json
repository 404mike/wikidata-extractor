Their first full-length record, White Music, was then recorded in less than two weeks, and released for January 1978. Partridge characterized the album as \"Captain Beefheart meets the Archies\" shrouded in 1950s-style retrofuturism. He reflected that the album was the sum of everything the band enjoyed, including the Beatles, Sun Ra, and Atomic Rooster, but dismissed the contents as premature songs \"built around this electric wordplay stuff\". White Music reached number 38 on the UK Albums Chart. Although the album was well received by the press (Melody Maker, NME, Sounds, and Record Mirror all gave positive reviews), none of its singles managed to chart. They rerecorded \"This Is Pop\" as a lead single. Its follow-up, \"Statue of Liberty\", was banned on BBC Radio due to the lyric \"I sail beneath her skirt\". With each member placed on a \u00a325 weekly salary, the band toured perpetually for the next five years. The group also made appearances on the children's television shows Tiswas and Magpie, which meant they would occasionally play for under-16 crowds on these early tours. Partridge enjoyed these early shows, but would later resent touring as the band's audience numbers grew and the performing experience became more impersonal.", "When Gregory joined the band in 1979, Partridge learned that they both shared a longtime enthusiasm for 1960s psychedelic music. An album of songs in that style was immediately put to consideration, but the group could not go through with it due to their commercial obligations to Virgin. In November 1984, one month after The Big Expresss release, Partridge and John Leckie traveled to Monmouth to produce the album Miss America by singer-songwriter Mary Margaret O'Hara, who had recently signed with Virgin. Partridge and Leckie were dismissed due to conflicts related to their religious affiliations or lack thereof (O'Hara was a devout Catholic). Partridge was feeling inspired by Nick Nicely's 1982 psychedelic single \"Hilly Fields 1892\", and devised a recording project to fill the newfound gap in his schedule. The rules were as follows: songs must follow the conventions of 1967 and 1968 psychedelia; no more than two takes allowed; use vintage equipment wherever possible. After receiving a \u00a35,000 advance from a skeptical Virgin Records, the group devoted two weeks to the sessions.", "Partridge was reluctant to make another Dukes album, but to appease requests from his bandmates and Virgin Records, Psonic Psunspot (1987) was recorded. This time, 10 songs and a \u00a310,000 budget was supplied, while John Leckie returned as producer. Once again, the Dukes' record outsold XTC's previous album in the UK (Skylarking in this case). Partridge felt it was \"a bit upsetting to think that people preferred these pretend personalities to our own personalities ... But I don't mind because we have turned into the Dukes slowly over the years.\" Likewise, Moulding felt that the \"psychedelic element was being more ingratiated into the pie\" since 25 O'Clock. When issued on CD, Psonic Psunspot was combined with 25 O'Clock and given the title Chips from the Chocolate Fireball (1987).", "The band are often compared reverentially to 1960s acts such as the Who, the Kinks, and most frequently, the Beatles. In a 1991 article that focused on a resurgence of power pop groups, members of Jellyfish and the Posies reflected that they were drawn to 1960s artists because of the 1980s music they influenced. As the Posies' Jon Auer said: \"our '60s-ish-ness is actually early-'80s-ish-ness, a pop sensibility that came from listening to Squeeze and XTC\". According to Chris Ingham, acts such as Kula Shaker, the Shamen and the Stone Roses recruited engineer John Leckie chiefly because of his productions for the retro-psychedelic Dukes of Stratosphear records. According to Neville Farmer, the name XTC inspired the names of U2, R.E.M., and INXS. Japanese band Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her was named after the XTC song of similar title. Peter Gabriel is quoted: \"I've always looked to XTC for inventive songwriting, innovative production, and a sense of humor. It's their strong blend of personalities that make them one of the great British bands.\" Kurt Cobain of Nirvana said in 1991: \"There\u2019s a lot of good pop music.

It was first released on 7 September 1999 in France, on 28 September 1999 in the United States by Maverick Records, and on 4 October 1999 in the United Kingdom by Mushroom Records and Taste Media. Recorded between April and May 1999 at RAK Studios and Sawmills Studio, respectively, the album was produced by John Leckie and Paul Reeve in conjunction with the band. Showbiz was a moderate commercial success, reaching number 29 on the UK Albums Chart.", "John Leckie, the producer of the album, started attending Muse's concerts in the latter half of 1998. Leckie was based at Sawmills recording studio, where the owner Dennis Smith had given the band free recording time the previous year, from which the Muse EP had resulted in 1998. He built up a relationship with the band during this time, coming to say that he'd \"want to work with the band if ever they could afford him\". Leckie had not worked with many bands for quite some time prior to doing so with Muse. The recording was finished by 15 May 1999.", "Upon its release, the album received positive to mixed reviews from music critics, who saw the young band's potential, but were also quick to dismiss the album as promising yet derivative of other alternative rock bands of the 90s. Several critics drew comparisons to Radiohead, due to the style of the songs, and the fact that Showbiz was produced by John Leckie, who also worked on the aforementioned band's album The Bends. Neva Chonin of Rolling Stone gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, saying Showbiz \"matches Thom Yorke's penchant for majestic agony \u2013 screams and the word self-destruction pepper the title track \u2013 but with an edge that's quirkier and decidedly more ragged than their elders\". Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork said in his review of the album that \"Muse expertly boil down Radiohead into punkish radio nuggets\", but went on to question that \"despite this promise, where can they go from here?\", which resulted in a rating of 6.7 of a possible 10. In a less favourable review, NME said that \"Showbiz is not as clever as they think it is ... \"Unintended\" and the title track are overwrought, prone to excruciatingly bad pseudo poetry\", which ended in a 6 out of 10 score from the publication. On the other hand, a more positive review came from Edna Gundersen of USA Today, who gave the album 3 out of 4 stars, saying that the album \"offers smart, seductive rock that's sophisticated but not stuffy, fun but not frilly\", and that the songs \"get a boost from the handsome voice of Matthew Bellamy, who builds tension by vocally snowballing from a hushed intensity to full-throttle wails.\"", "*John Leckie \u2013 production and mixing on \"Sunburn\", \"Fillip\", \"Falling Down\", \"Cave\", \"Escape\", \"Overdue\" and \"Hate This and I'll Love You\"", "Category:Albums produced by John Leckie"]}, {"page": "Starsailor (band)", "response": ["The band co-produced seven of the other tracks with Danton Supple and former The Stone Roses and Radiohead producer John Leckie was brought in to oversee the recording of \"Shark Food\"."]}, {"page": "The Coral", "response": ["The Coral released their sixth album Butterfly House on 12 July 2010.

Michael Timmins found a house near a gristmill on a pond, a couple hours from Toronto called Maiden's Mill. Michael spent six months at the house writing the songs, and during that period, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down at times to work on a few songs, then let Michael write some more, and then revisit and create some more, until the Junkies were ready to record. The bands plan for the album was to develop the songs minimally at this point, and to use a studio and a good producer to help finish up the work. They searched out a producer, and selected John Leckie who impressed the band with his love of music and his resume of other bands he had worked with. Leckie came over from England and joined the band at Maiden's Mill and spent a few days listening to the songs the band had assembled. Leckie found a recording studio in Toronto called McClear that he liked for its large room and for being well-equipped. In September 1997, the basic tracks were recorded, along with guitar overdubs, and the vocals. Michael Timmins managed to record seven or eight overdubs for the title track, which was his career high for overdubs. Leckie recommended Vince Jones of The Grapes of Wrath for the keyboard work, and he flew in from Vancouver to add piano and organ work for ten tracks in one day. Some of the overdub work was done at another Toronto studio, Chemical, which eventually became one of the Cowboy Junkies favorite studios. When the recording was complete, Leckie took the tracks to London to mix the tracks at Abbey Road. Leckie and the Junkies mixed for three weeks in Studio One, and recorded strings in Studio Two. During this period, the band were constantly reminded of the Beatles previous occupancy of the studios, and somewhat awed by it. At one point, the band ran into Robert Plant and Jimmy Page in the basement cafeteria and shared a brief greeting. Craig Leon wrote out the string arrangements, and Gavyn Wright and a small string orchestra created the music, all the while overseen in a small control room which was crowded with the band, Leckie, two engineers, an agent, and a writer, which added up to a very expensive three hours of a recording session. After a few weeks of mixing, the Cowboy Junkies returned to Canada with a CD. However, after taking a break from all music for a period, the band decided a few of the mixes could be different, so they had Michael Timmins sit with Chris Lord-Alge (Mr. Mixer) at his Los Angeles studio and re-mix several of the tracks for a few days.", "*John Leckie \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing", "Category:Albums produced by John Leckie"]}, {"page": "The Lilac Time", "response": ["The Duffy brothers and Michael Weston recorded music that was first released on Swordfish Records in 1987 and later became the band's self-titled debut.
