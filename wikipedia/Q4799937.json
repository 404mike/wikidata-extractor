From 1917 he was also a founding member of the Advisory Committee for the Welfare of the Blind, a government body, and remained in that role until 1942.  Purse's cooperation with the government led to some complaints in the NLB's journal, the Blind Advocate. One member W. Halkyard wrote to say Purse was \"a former comrade influenced through personal gain and was now on the side of the opponents\".  Purse responded by calling Halkyard \"mischievous and inaccurate\" and that his intention was only to increase his stature in the NLB by criticising others.  Purse was persuaded by Sir Arthur Pearson in 1916 to accept employment as director of aftercare at the National Institute for the Blind, helping to train blind people and find opportunities for them in the workplace.  He remained in the role until 1943.  Purse became president of the NLB again in 1918, holding the position for two years."]}]}}
