Following a string of poor performances, Awford scrapped his 3-5-2 system that utilised wing-backs, but did not blame Wynter or his teammates for the lack of function within the system. After making 15 appearances for Portsmouth in all competitions, Awford brought in Gillingham loanee Matt Fish as a replacement for Wynter, but insisted he would remain a part of his squad but the situation would be reassessed in the January transfer window. However, on 28 December, both Fish and Wynter returned to their parent clubs after the loans were not renewed with both players having fallen out of favour at Fratton Park."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|17||DF||||16||Matt Fish||1||0||0||0||1", "|16||||DF||Matt Fish||2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0", "| Matt Fish"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|2||DF||Matt Fish||2||1||0||0||3", "|2||DF||Matt Fish||5||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||6||0"]}, {"page": "Stephen Butcher (footballer)", "response": ["Butcher made his debut for Gillingham on 3 August 2013, replacing Matt Fish five minutes into a 1\u20130 defeat to Colchester United at Priestfield Stadium.
