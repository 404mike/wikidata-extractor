Fictional content aside, the point of origin of virtually all of his stories is biographical: they are often set in places he knew or had visited, and feature thinly-disguised, often deeply unflattering, depictions of friends, family and acquaintances (to the extent that over thirty years after Welch's death, his art school friend, the artist Gerald Leet, refused to contribute to Michael De-la-Noy's biography, where he is identified only as 'Gerald' in the index.De-la-Noy, Michael (25 June 1998), Obituary: Gerald Leet, \"The Independent\"James Methuen-Campbell stated that before his death in 1998, Gerald Leet (who sometimes used his middle name \u2014Mackenzie\u2014as a surname) was more co-operative for his own biography of Welch, published in 2002.). Welch chose to depict himself a few times in fictionalised form, most notably as \"Orvil Pym\" in In Youth is Pleasure, and as \"Mary\" in \"The Fire in the Wood\". \"Robert\" was also one of his favourite personas. The philosopher Maurice Cranston, who had known him since his teens (and who featured in at least one story) observed that Welch was as unforgiving in depictions of himself as he was of others.Cranston, Maurice (1951) \"Denton Welch\" in The Spectator, 1 June 1951, reprinted in Spectator Harvest (1952), ed.

(1984a) The Journals of Denton Welch, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books. . p. x As such, the notebooks include undated fragments, a substantial entry for an uncompleted novel, as well as poetry and longer prose passages (all of which were published separately). De-la-Noy observes that several of the entries seem intended as a recollection write-up for use elsewhere, potentially prompted by an anniversary or other memory-triggering event.De-la-Noy (1984a), p. xi As if to emphasise their non-linear nature, the manuscripts themselves are not physically diaries but \"nineteen thin, paper-covered 'school' exercise-books.\"Brooke, Jocelyn (ed.) (1952) The Denton Welch Journals, London: Hamish Hamilton, p. xv James Methuen-Campbell has noted that the journals (now in the Denton Welch Archive at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin) appear to have been written \"with a definite eye on posterity\".Methuen-Campbell, James (2002) Denton Welch: Writer and Artist, Carlton-in-Coverdale: Tartarus Press , p. 114 Having been left the invalided victim of a near-fatal collision between his bicycle and a motor car in 1935, Welch was acutely aware of his mortality, and it seems to have been rarely far from his thoughts. As he confided in a letter to his partner Eric Oliver, \"I think I'm going to have a very sticky death\".Quoted in De-la-Noy, Michael (1984b) Denton Welch: The Making of a Writer, London: Viking , p. 212", "As might be expected from personal papers, the journals are an unvarnished depiction of the author's frailties. Welch's first biographer Robert Phillips states that they portray him, \"at his most thoroughly unprofessional, disclosing the life of a high-strung, complex, temperamental young man who, in spite of obvious gifts, is visited with... spitefulness, childishness, vanity, gloryseeking, and materialism\"Phillips, Robert (1974) Denton Welch, New York: Twayne, p. 148 not to mention snobbery and callousness. In the view of Michael De-la-Noy, these undoubted shortcomings are counterbalanced by \"a consistent honesty about himself\" which, given the hugely challenging physical circumstances he faced, display \"a perfectly justfied self-indulgence\".De-la-Noy (1984a) p. xii", "The third edition of 1984 was prompted by the discovery of additional material by the actor Benjamin Whitrow.De-la-Noy (1984a) p. xi Whitrow had been corresponding with one of Welch's friends, Francis Streeten. After Streeten's death, Whitrow found amongst his belongings Brooke's typescript working copy of the journals,In his 1988 biography of Edward Sackville-West, Michael De-la-Noy suggests that Eric Oliver had originally entrusted editorship of the journals to Streeten; one to whom, in De-la-Noy's words, \"it would have been rash to trust with a shopping list.\" (, p. 242). In a letter to Brooke, Sackville-West referred to Oliver as a \"seedy nobody\". and these he used to uncover (in some cases decipher) the material Brooke had excised.Whitrow, Benjamin (2013) \"Feverish Haste\", Slightly Foxed 38,  This new edition completely revised the content, replacing all the redacted names, and expanding Brooke's edition by some 75,000 wordsDe-la-Noy (1984a) p. x but not including the longer prose passages and some of the poetry (published in A Last Sheaf), and novel fragment (published as I Left My Grandfather's House in 1958).The 1984 edition is not completely unexpurgated, however. De-la-Noy states in the introduction that \"two very minor cuts have been made on the grounds of libel\" with a further excision of \"gratuitous gossip.\" (1984a, p. x) However, reviewingHollinghurst, Alan (1984) \"Diminished Pictures\", Times Literary Supplement, December 21 1984, p. 1479-80 this edition, the writer Alan Hollinghurst expressed reservations about its veracity: finding errors in the extracts De-la-Noy quoted from the Journals in his biography, Hollinghurst wondered which ones were the misprints.Hollinghurst found over seventy inconsistences: as an example, in the 1984 edition of the Journals, Welch identifies his partner's aunt as \"...delicate and gentle\" (De-la-Noy (1984a) p. 167) whereas in the biography this is quoted as \"...delicate and genteel\" (De-la-Noy (1984b), p. 236)Jean-Louis Chevalier's overview of the Denton Welch papers at the University of Texas at Austin for the Texas Quarterly, Summer 1972, quotes a handful of passages from the journals which Brooke did not use. Even here there are inconsistencies with the 1984 publication. For instance, \"golden brown\" becomes \"gold brown\" in the 1984 edition, \"verandah\" becomes \"veranda\", \"all those fifty years ago\" becomes \"all those years ago\". These errors are all in a single journal entry and on one page. Even more critically, an entry for January 4 1944 states: \"... I thought how many times I had sat in tea-shops and restaurants alone, listening to others talking, watching them, fitting into their lives, then watching them walk out of the door and away for ever.\" (p. 12). In the 1984 edition, De-la-Noy omits a comma, and in so doing changes the meaning: \"... watching them fitting in to their lives, then watching them walk out of the door...\" (1984a, p. 180). In his notes to his 2002 biography, James Methuen-Campbell identifies several other misprints or misreadings present in the 1984 edition.The tale of how the 1984 edition came into being is particularly labyrinthine: after Welch's death, his friend Helen Roeder transcribed the journals into a typewritten copy, almost certainly making errors in the process. Jocelyn Brooke used this transcription for his 1952 edition (and it appears he physically cut and pasted Roeder's work to achieve this). This heavily-edited document passed (possibly back - see note 15 above) into the hands of Francis Streeten, and thence to Benjamin Whitrow, who attempted to reconstruct the original material from what remained. De-la-Noy used this as the basis for his edition, stating that it \"saved me hours of routine work\" (1984a, p. xi), presumably meaning the work of verifying its accuracy with the originals in Texas."]}]}}
