Extracts were also broadcast in 1925 as part of Shakespeare: Scene and Story, with Edna Godfrey-Turner and William Macready, and in 1926 as part of Shakespeare's Heroines, with Madge Titheradge and Edmund Willard.

In 1932, National Programme aired another truncated version, this one running eighty-five minutes, and again starring Couper, with Francis James as Petruchio. In 1935, Peter Creswell directed a broadcast of the relatively complete text (only the Bianca subplot was trimmed) on National Programme, starring Mary Hinton and Godfrey Tearle. This was the first non-theatrical version of the play to feature Sly, who was played by Stuart Robertson. In 1941, Creswell directed another adaptation for BBC Home Service, again starring Tearle, with Fay Compton as Katherina. In 1947, BBC Light Programme aired extracts for their Theatre Programme from John Burrell's Edinburgh Festival production, with Patricia Burke and Trevor Howard.

Starring Harvey's wife Nina de Silva and Harvey himself as Petruchio, the production was very much in the style of Poel's own minimalist and authentically Elizabethan productions. Harvey kept Sly on stage throughout, however, in a unique move, he neither incorporated text from A Shrew nor did he have Sly lose interest and fall asleep. Instead, Sly explicitly reacts to the play - laughing at certain points, attempting to climb onto the stage during the wedding before being restrained by his 'wife', and finally succeeding in getting onto the stage later in the play, at which point he shook Petruchio's hand and then introduced himself to Katherina (albeit without dialogue). In an \"extremely conventional production\" at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1919, starring Ethel Warwick and Edmund Willard, William Bridges-Adams stuck rigidly to the First Folio text, but completely removed the Induction and all references to Sly."]}, {"page": "Heat Wave (1935 film)", "response": ["* Edmund Willard as Hoffman "]}, {"page": "The Silver Box", "response": ["In 1949 it was a BBC play, produced by Fred O'Donovan.
