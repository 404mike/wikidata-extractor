He made a duck, and not long afterwards he had returned to what was to become his accustomed place near or at the bottom of the order. His wicket-keeping was more of a success, though it took him until mid-June 1921 to record his first stumping, that of Edward Solb\u00e9 of Kent."]}, {"page": "Thomas G.

Rose himself, however, had a fairly successful game with the ball, claiming 3-68 in Kent's first innings; his victims were Bill Ashdown, Edward Solb\u00e9 and Tich Freeman."]}, {"page": "Edward Solbe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Solb\u00e9"]}]}}
