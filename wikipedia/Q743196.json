His name was also written as Teddiman, Tyddiman or Teddyman.\nThe early career of Thomas Teddeman is unknown; he was not a naval captain during the First Anglo-Dutch War. He was the namesake of his father, who descended from a family of ship-owners in Dover. His cousin was the naval captain Henry Teddeman.\nTeddeman, first serving the English Commonwealth, commanded from 1659 till 1660 the Tredagh (after the English Restoration renamed to HMS Resolution) in the Mediterranean during the Anglo-Spanish War. From 31 May till 10 June 1660 he chased six Spanish vessels he encountered off Algiers. In May 1661 he became captain of HMS Fairfax and in 1663 commanded HMS Kent on which he brought the English ambassador to Russia, the Earl of Carlisle, to Archangel in July. In May 1664 Teddeman was made commander of HMS Revenge and the same year promoted to captain of HMS Swiftsure. In 1665, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, he distinguished himself as rear admiral of the Blue Squadron in the Battle of Lowestoft, with as flagship the new second rate HMS Royal Katherine, and was knighted on 30 June (Old Style).\nIn August 1665 Teddeman was sent on the Revenge to Bergen to capture a Dutch treasure fleet with a flotilla of frigates but was defeated in the Battle of V\u00e5gen by Commandeur Pieter de Bitter. Though this was a major disappointment to Charles II of England, Teddeman's career did not suffer much and he fought, again on the Katherine, the next year as vice admiral of the Blue in the Four Days Battle and as vice-admiral of the White in the St James's Day Battle. In 1667 Teddeman had no command, the main vessels of the English fleet having been laid up. In 1668 he commanded on HMS Cambridge, but was the subject of an investigation by English Parliament, trying to establish the causes of the lost war, by which he was much troubled. On 13 May he died from a fever caused by a thrush in the mouth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester", "response": ["Rochester attempted to redeem himself by volunteering for the navy in the Second Dutch War in the winter of 1665, serving under the Earl of Sandwich. His courage at the Battle of V\u00e5gen, serving on board the ship of Thomas Teddeman, made him a war hero. Pleased with his conduct, Charles appointed Rochester a Gentleman of the Bedchamber in March 1666, which granted him prime lodgings in Whitehall and a pension of \u00a31,000 a year.Frank H.

In the summer of 1666, Rochester returned to sea, serving aboard  under Edward Spragge. He again showed extraordinary courage in battle, including rowing between vessels under heavy cannon fire, to deliver Spragge's messages around the fleet."]}, {"page": "Battle of V\u00e5gen", "response": ["The English battle fleet on 4 July became present in the North Sea to intercept the squadron of Vice-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, which was about to arrive from America after he had raided the English possessions there. The English fleet learned about the arrival of the first ships of the VOC fleet, which had been announced by the English ambassador in the Republic, George Downing, from a merchantman from Rostock on 22 July. This caused a heated discussion about which target should have priority. The fleet commander, Lord Sandwich, against the advice of most of his flag officers, decided to split the fleet. On 30 July, after a merchantman from Ostend had reported the other VOC ships had also arrived, a small task force was dispatched to Bergen to capture or at least block the convoy. The flotilla under Rear-Admiral Thomas Teddeman first had 22 warships but was reduced to 14 after eight ships sailed too westerly, were swept beyond Bergen and could not beat up the wind to the south. Besides the gunships, the fireships Bryar, Greyhound, and Martin Gally were present. Teddeman reached Bergen at six in the evening of 1 August and blocked the entry to the bay. The beginning of the English action was inauspicious: Teddeman's flagship Revenge ran aground that same evening at Cape Nordnes, and it was only by much effort that it managed to work itself free. The entrance of the bay being only about 400 m wide, the English could position only seven ships there: from north to south Prudent Mary, Breda, Foresight, Bendish, Happy Return, Sapphire and Pembroke. The others pointed their guns at the coastal batteries."]}, {"page": "Order of battle at the Battle of Lowestoft", "response": ["| align= left |Rear-Admiral Thomas Teddeman"]}, {"page": "Pieter de Bitter", "response": ["Pieter de Bitter (15June 1666) was a 17th-century Dutch officer of the Dutch East India Company (, commonly abbreviated to VOC).
