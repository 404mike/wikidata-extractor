The island's most powerful bushranger, the self-styled \"Lieutenant Governor of the Woods\", Michael Howe, led a gang of up to one hundred members \"in what amounted to a civil war\" with the colonial government. His control over large swathes of the island prompted elite squatters from Hobart and Launceston to collude with him, and for six months in 1815, Lieutenant-Governor Thomas Davey, fearing a convict uprising, declared martial law in an effort to suppress Howe's influence. Most of the gang had either been captured or killed by 1818, the year Howe was clubbed to death.Boyce, James (2010). Van Diemen's Land. Black Inc.. . pp. 76\u201382. Vandemonian bushranging peaked in the 1820s with hundreds of bolters at large, among the most notorious being Matthew Brady's gang, and cannibal serial killers Alexander Pearce and Thomas Jeffries. Originally a New South Wales bushranger, Jackey Jackey (alias of William Westwood) was sent to Van Diemen's Land in 1842 after attempting to escape Cockatoo Island. In 1843, he escaped Port Arthur, and took up bushranging in Tasmania's mountains, but was recaptured and sent to Norfolk Island, where, as leader of the 1846 Cooking Pot Uprising, he murdered three constables, and was hanged along with sixteen of his men."]}, {"page": "Aboriginal Tasmanians", "response": ["By 1816, kidnapping of Aboriginal children for labour had become widespread.
