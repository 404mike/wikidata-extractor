About 100 students tried to occupy the office of Sandra Kemp, head of the college at that time, in protest over lack of supervision for dissertations. Students later occupied a lecture theatre and private security guards tried to remove protesting students. This failed when a member of academic staff questioned their right to touch the students and police were summoned who prevailed upon the protesters to leave the building. Several students faced disciplinary action, including suspension."]}, {"page": "The Ruskin - Library, Museum and Research Centre", "response": ["The Director of The Ruskin is Professor Sandra Kemp.'Lancaster University Staff Profile', accessed 15 September 2021"]}, {"page": "Professor Sandra Kemp", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sandra Kemp"]}, {"page": "Lizzie Allen Harker", "response": ["Lizzie Allen Harker (n\u00e9e Watson; 1863 \u2013 14 April 1933) was an English author.The Times, 15 April 1933; pg. 12; issue 46419; col D; Mrs. Allen Harker Authoress Of \"Marigold\" Category: Obituaries- Harker, L.
