As a player, he was a right-winger who began his professional career at Blackburn Rovers, and later played for Mansfield Town, Manchester City and Tranmere Rovers in the years before World War II. In August 1939, he joined Carlisle United, but because of the war, he had to wait seven years before making his debut for the club in an official league game. He played one post-war season for Carlisle.\nDuring the war, Dellow served in the RAF. In 1948, Dellow moved to the Netherlands. He coached HVV Helmond, Holland Sport, FC Volendam between 1964 and 1969, and guided the club to promotion to the Eredivisie in 1967. He also coached GVAV, Heracles Almelo and Helmond Sport in the 1970s.\nAfter retiring from football, Dellow spent his retirement years in Almelo. He died on 7 November 2013, aged 99.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 7", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Ron Dellow, English footballer and manager (b. 1914)"]}, {"page": "Heracles Almelo", "response": ["*  Ron Dellow (1 July 1972 \u2013 30 June 1975)"]}, {"page": "Helmond Sport", "response": ["* Ron Dellow (1975\u201377)"]}, {"page": "FC Volendam", "response": ["A year later, in 1955, Volendam also entered professional football by means of the issue of bonds. Volendam ended its first season in third place and thus qualified for the first season of the second-tier Eerste Divisie; 1956\u201357. In the 1958\u201358 KNVB Cup, Volendam reached the final by beating MVV 1\u20133 in the semi-final. Sparta, however, proved too strong there, and Volendam finished runners-up. The following season, Volendam became champions in the Eerste Divisie A and thus promoted to the top-tier Eredivisie for the first time in club history. However, the euphoria was short-lived, and after one season at the highest level, the club suffered relegation again. Soon, the club had established its reputation as the Heen-en-weer club (\"the back-and-forth club\") due to its numerous promotions and relegations between the first and second tiers of Dutch football. Head coach Bram Appel piloted Volendam back to the Eredivisie within one season, honouring the club's new nickname. This time, however, the stay at the highest level was longer than one season. Striker Dick Tol, who would become the club's all-time top goalscorer, became the top goalscorer of the 1961\u201362 Eredivisie with 27 goals. After three seasons in the Eredivisie, the club once again suffered relegation in the 1963\u201364 season. The third promotion for Volendam took place in 1967 under the English manager Ron Dellow. That season also marked Dick Tol's final season before retiring, as he became top goalscorer of the Eerste Divisie.", "* Ron Dellow (1964\u201369)"]}, {"page": "Blauw-Wit Amsterdam", "response": ["* Ron Dellow (1954\u20131956)"]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Eredivisie", "response": ["| Ron Dellow"]}]}}
