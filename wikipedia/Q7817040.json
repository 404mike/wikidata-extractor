The \"Saints\" had made a poor start to the 1910\u201311 Southern League season having won only once in their first six games, and Brown was persuaded to re-join the club in October, replacing Bill Buckenham who returned to the Army. With Brown playing alongside Frank Jefferis and new signings Sid Kimpton and Martin Dunne, the team started to turn the season round and in the six weeks from the start of November 1910 they won six out of seven games with Brown scoring six goals, including a hat-trick in a 5\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle. From January onwards, however, the season took a turn for the worse and the team only managed two more victories narrowly avoiding relegation at the end of the season, with Brown only scoring twice more.

For the following season, Haynes linked up with Tom Nicol, with Meston moving to right half. Their defensive prowess helped Southampton to retain their Southern League title, again conceding only 18 goals (from 22 matches).

At this time, Burnley had a very large squad of players, including \"nearly fifty Scotsmen\", so the majority of their players had to content themselves by appearing in the reserve side. One of those Scotsmen was Tom Nicol, who made the No. 2 shirt his own in 1892\u201393 as a result of which, Jeffrey made no further first-team appearances for the Turf Moor club."]}, {"page": "Tom Smith (footballer, born 1877)", "response": ["Despite this auspicious start, Smith's subsequent indifferent form led the directors to realise that they had acquired the services of the wrong player, and by February Smith had lost his place, initially to Tom Nicol and then to Jimmy Yates.
