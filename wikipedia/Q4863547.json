The news was widely publicized leading many to surmise that he was in fact the \"fifth man\", a designation which would be confirmed in 1989 by KGB agent Oleg Gordievsky who had defected to Britain.   ", "In 1967, Cairncross moved to Rome, where he worked for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization as a translator, also taking on work for the Research Office of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Banca d'Italia and IMI. In 1970, he moved to France and lived in Provence. In the BNL, a young economist engaged with international scenarios analysis (the Iran\u2013Iraq War of 1980\u20131988, petroleum's strategic routes in the Middle East and Far East) reported a strong and unusual interest by Cairncross about the bank's role in that area. During his time in Rome, his secret finally reached the public. In December 1979, in the wake of the Blunt scandal, the former civil servant Jock Colville alluded to the Sunday Times's journalist, Barrie Penrose, that there had been another spy in the Foreign Office at the same time as Donald Maclean. After searching the Foreign Office lists, Penrose concluded that Cairncross was that spy and confronted him. Cairncross's third confession became front-page news. In 1981, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher informed parliament that Cairncross was a Soviet agent and was living with his wife in the west of England while he wrote his memoirs. His status as the \"fifth man\" was established in 1990 by Oleg Gordievsky, the KGB defector. Cairncross retired to the south of France until 1995 when he returned to Britain and married American opera singer Gayle Brinkerhoff.

In the days leading up to his resignation there had been no hint that he was about to go.  Two months later, on 12 May, Wilson invited two BBC reporters, Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour to visit him at his home at 5 North Street, near Parliament.  He told the reporters that he believed members of MI5 had been involved in a plot to undermine his Government.  He said that he had called in the head of MI6, Sir Maurice Oldfield, who told him that there was a section of MI5 that \"was unreliable\" and that he (Oldfield) was \"going to bring it out\".  Wilson also said that he had called in the head of MI5, Sir Michael Hanley, who confirmed the existence within his Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right-wing views.  Later, the two reporters interviewed Sir Michael Hanley at his home and asked him if there had been talk of a coup to overthrow the Wilson Government in the mid 1970s.
