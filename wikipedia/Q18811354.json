He was described by Geoffrey Chamberlain as \"a primary influence on world gynaecology in the years between the wars\".Bonney is primarily remembered for the invention of an antiseptic solution known as \"Bonney's blue\", used to sterilise and stain the vagina, cervix and surrounding skin during gynaecological procedures, and therefore reducing post-operative infection. He became experienced in the radical extended Wertheim hysterectomy for treating cervical cancer, performing more than 500 of these in his lifetime.\nPersonal tragedy directed Bonney towards conservative surgery and he became a pioneer in the field of the less drastic procedures of ovarian cystectomy for removing ovarian cysts and the myomectomy for removing uterine fibroids. Its preference over hysterectomy preserved the fertility of many women of reproductive age. He developed a surgical clamp to reduce post-myomectomy haemorrhage, established operative techniques to reduce post-operative haematomas and modified the Reverdin needle.\nIn addition, he wrote more than 200 medical papers and co-authored and illustrated A Textbook of Gynaecological Surgery (1911), still in print in 2004 as Bonney's Gynaecological Surgery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Donald", "response": ["* Victor Bonney prize"]}, {"page": "Richard Turner-Warwick", "response": ["In 1987 he was awarded the Victor Bonney prize from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

This collaboration would lead them to proving the Wertheim radical hysterectomy that was used to treat cervical cancer.
