At the time of his death, he was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University and Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London. Dworkin had taught previously at Yale Law School and the University of Oxford, where he was the Professor of Jurisprudence, successor to renowned philosopher H. L. A. Hart. An influential contributor to both philosophy of law  and political philosophy, Dworkin received the 2007 Holberg International Memorial Prize in the Humanities for \"his pioneering scholarly work\" of \"worldwide impact.\" According to a survey in The Journal of Legal Studies, Dworkin was the second most-cited American legal scholar of the twentieth century.  After his death, the Harvard legal scholar Cass Sunstein said Dworkin was \"one of the most important legal philosophers of the last 100 years. He may well head the list.\"His theory of law as integrity as presented in his book titled Law's Empire, in which judges interpret the law in terms of consistent moral principles, especially justice and fairness, is among the most influential contemporary theories about the nature of law. Dworkin advocated a \"moral reading\" of the United States Constitution, and an interpretivist approach to law and morality. He was a frequent commentator on contemporary political and legal issues, particularly those concerning the Supreme Court of the United States, often in the pages of The New York Review of Books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crime", "response": ["Thus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal logic and consistency, and that the state's agents used state power with responsibility. Ronald Dworkin rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of deference (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make."]}, {"page": "Coercion", "response": ["John Rawls, Thomas Nagel and Ronald Dworkin argue that the state is coercive. Max Weber defined the state as a community that has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Morris argues that the state make operate through incentives rather than coercion. In health care, informal coercion may be used to make a patient adherence to a doctors treatment plan, such as taking psychoactive medication. Under certain circumstances physical coercion is used to  treat a patient involuntarily."]}, {"page": "Democracy", "response": ["Robert A. Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.Dahl, Robert, (1989). Democracy and its Critics. New Haven: Yale University Press.  Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that \"democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.\"Dworkin, Ronald (2006). Is Democracy Possible Here?

Primary rules require individuals to act or not act in certain ways and create duties for the governed to obey. Secondary rules are rules that confer authority to create new primary rules or modify existing ones. Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (how to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (how laws are amended), and the rule of recognition (how laws are identified as valid). The validity of a legal system comes from the \"rule of recognition\", which is a customary practice of officials (especially barristers and judges) who identify certain acts and decisions as sources of law. In 1981, Neil MacCormick wrote a pivotal book on Hart (second edition published in 2008), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his Institutions of Law, 2007). Other important critiques include those of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and Joseph Raz.", "American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin's legal theory attacks legal positivists that separate law's content from morality.Brooks, \"Review of Dworkin and His Critics with Replies by Dworkin\", Modern Law Review, vol. 69 no. 6 In his book Law's Empire,Ronald Dworkin, Law's Empire (1986) Harvard University Press Dworkin argued that law is an \"interpretive\" concept that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the best moral justification for the institutional facts and practices that form a society's legal tradition. It follows from Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some truths about the moral justifications of the social and political practices of that society. It is consistent with Dworkin's view\u2014in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists\u2014that  in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best moral justification for its practices.", "Deontology is the \"theory of duty or moral obligation\".Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, p. 378 (2d Coll. Ed. 1978). The philosopher Immanuel Kant formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin."]}, {"page": "Justice", "response": ["In political theory, liberalism includes two traditional elements: liberty and equality. Most contemporary theories of justice emphasize the concept of equality, including Rawls' theory of justice as fairness. For Ronald Dworkin, a complex notion of equality is the sovereign political virtue.(Ronald Dworkin, Sovereign Virtue (Harvard University Press, 2000) Dworkin raises the question of whether society is under a duty of justice to help those responsible for the fact that they need help. Complications arise in distinguishing matters of choice and matters of chance, as well as justice for future generations in the redistribution of resources that he advocates.Young Kim, Justice as Right Actions (Lexington Books, 2015), ch.7 ()"]}]}}
