For thirty-four years he taught at Jesus College, Cambridge, serving as dean from 1895 to 1916.  Then, at the age of 61, he became the Briggs Professor of Christian Institutions at Union Theological Seminary, New York City, finally becoming emeritus in 1933.

Beginnings was a project that had been conceived during conversations with F. J. Foakes-Jackson while Lake was still at the Leiden University, sometime before 1912 (vol. v, p. vii). It sought to investigate the view \"that Christianity in the first century achieved a synthesis between the Greco-Oriental and the Jewish religions in the Roman Empire.  The preaching of repentance, and of the Kingdom of God begun by Jesus passed into the sacramental cult of the Lord Jesus Christ. But the details are complex and obscure.  What were the exact elements in this synthesis? How was it effected?\" (vol. i, p. vii). The undertaking began at Cambridge University in the form of a seminar, presided over by F. C. Burkitt.  It \"was largely attended by scholars of the most varied interests in the University, not only theological, but historical, classical, mathematical, and Oriental [...] Lake paid frequent visits from Leiden\" and \"the United States and Canada were not unrepresented\" (vol. v, p. vii). The project was to be a grand endeavour. The five volumes that were ultimately published only comprise \"Part I\". As they explain: \"Before, however, attempting to reconstruct this history we believed it necessary to study Acts in the light of the results of modern criticism. [...] Later on we hope to return to the subject and reconsider the narrative of the life of Jesus, and the influence on the Church of his own teaching and of the teaching of others about him\" (vol. ii, p. v). As it turned out they were never able to \"return to the subject\" and complete the project. \"In sum,\" writes Baird, \"The Beginnings of Christianity is a monumental work\u2014the most extensive investigation of a NT book by English-speaking scholarship\" (cf. vol. v, p. ix).Baird, W.
