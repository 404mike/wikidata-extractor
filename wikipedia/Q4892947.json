The judgement, which forced Tolstoy into bankruptcy, was widely criticized as excessive and unfair. The way in which the Ministry of Defence supplied Aldington with certain documents that were denied to Tolstoy has been an especially controversial aspect of the trial, and Tolstoy continues to maintain that he was a victim of \"the Establishment\". Tolstoy retained a loyal set of defenders consisting of the Conservative MP Bernard Braine, the philosopher Roger Scruton, the journalist Chapman Pincher, the writer Nigel Nicolson, Lord Cranborne and from farther afield Solzhenitsyn, who was living in exile in the United States at the time.Burgh, Hugo de Investigative Journalism, Milton Park, Taylor & Francis 2000 p.250 The Tolstoy vs. Aldington case attracted much publicity as the British journalist Hugo de Burgh wrote: \"From 1989 to 1993 a historical investigation became news in tabloid and broadsheet media alike as argument raged over the merits of combatants in a struggle over who might have done what over a few days in 1945. The case of \"the Cossacks\" has been perhaps the single most prominent example of historical investigation to be turned into journalism, not only in acres of newsprint devoted to the story and based upon several books on the subject, but also in a programme in the BBC historical series, Timewatch\".Burgh, Hugo de Investigative Journalism, Milton Park, Taylor & Francis 2000 p.240"]}]}}
