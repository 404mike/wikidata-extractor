Beevor says that in January 1945 Montgomery had tried to claim far too much credit for the British (and for himself) in defeating the German counter-attack in the Ardennes in December 1944. This \"crass and unpleasant blunder\" helped make it impossible for Churchill and Field Marshal Alan Brooke to persuade Eisenhower of the need for an immediate thrust - to be led by Montgomery - through Germany to Berlin. Eisenhower did not accept the viability of the \"dagger thrust\" approach, it had already been agreed that Berlin would fall into the future Soviet occupation zone, and he was not willing to accept heavy casualties for no gain, so Eisenhower disregarded the British suggestions and continued with his conservative broad front strategy, and the Red Army reached Berlin well ahead of the Western Allies."]}, {"page": "Battle of Stalingrad", "response": ["A significant historical debate concerns the degree of terror in the Red Army. The British historian Antony Beevor noted the \"sinister\" message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: \"The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower\" as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed SMERSH). On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to Verdun, and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice. Richard Overy addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is \"easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,\" to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to \"distort our view of the Soviet war effort.\"Overy, Richard. Russia's War (New York: 1997), 201.

We all knew where we stood after we had heard it. And we all \u2013 it's true \u2013 felt better. Yes, we felt better.\""]}, {"page": "December 14", "response": ["*1946 \u2013 Antony Beevor, English historian and author"]}, {"page": "Francisco Franco", "response": ["According to Gabriel Jackson and Antony Beevor, the number of victims of the \"White Terror\" (executions and hunger or illness in prisons) only between 1939 and 1943 was 200,000.Jackson, Gabriel (1967).

William Shirer argued that Hitler's Balkan Campaign had delayed the commencement of Barbarossa by several weeks and thereby jeopardized it. Many later historians argue that the 22 June start date was sufficient for the German offensive to reach Moscow by September.

According to historian Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were so successful that German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result was not only a vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions."]}, {"page": "War film", "response": ["The British military historian Antony Beevor \"despair[s]\" at how film-makers from America and Britain \"play fast and loose with the facts\", yet imply that \"their version is as good as the truth\". For example, he calls the 2000 American film U-571 a \"shameless deception\" for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the Atlantic\u2014seven months before America entered the war. He is equally critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film Dunkirk with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat over the sea, and rescues mainly by the \"little ships\". Beevor feels, however, that Continental European film-makers are often \"far more scrupulous\"; for example, in his view the 2004 German film Downfall accurately depicted the historical events of Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker, and he considers the 1965 French film The 317th Platoon, set in Vietnam, \"the greatest war movie ever made\".
