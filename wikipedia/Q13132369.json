After the Roman departure from Britain in the early 5th century, pirates from Ireland colonised Anglesey and the nearby Ll\u0177n Peninsula. In response to this, Cunedda ap Edern, a Gododdin warlord from Scotland, came to the area and began to drive the Irish out. This was continued by his son Einion Yrth ap Cunedda and grandson Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion; the last Irish invaders were finally defeated in battle in 470. Anglesey as an island had a good defensive position, and so Aberffraw became the site of the court, or Llys, of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. Apart from a devastating Danish raid in 853, it remained the capital until the 13th century, when improvements to the English navy made the location indefensible. Anglesey was also briefly the most southerly possession of the Norwegian Empire."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1857 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Beaumaris||William Owen Stanley||Liberal"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1847\u20131857)", "response": ["|William Owen Stanley"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1832\u20131847)", "response": ["|William Owen Stanley"]}, {"page": "Elin's Tower", "response": ["Elin's Tower () is a Victorian stone tower on Holy Island, located around  west of Holyhead.

A selection of 2nd to 4th century finds included sherds of Samian ware pottery, a glass bead, a later Iron Age bronze tankard handle, a collection of stone objects including spindle whorls and rotary querns, a pennanular brooch and a carnelian intaglio.

It is a two-storey building measuring 1,732 square metres and is built of local green shaley rubble with buff sandstone dressings and slate roofing. After 145 years of use the hall temporarily closed its doors, then became a furniture store and, fittingly, a grocery store.
