A left-hander, he was considered to have one of the fastest serves in the world.  Although he won numerous tournaments on the West Coast, he played only twice in any of the four major Grand Slam tournaments.   In the summer of 1925 he travelled with an American contingent to England.  According to the Official Encyclopedia of Tennis, at the Eastbourne tournament Casey beat Patrick Wheatley of Great Britain in a 6\u20130 set that took only 9 minutes.  This is still considered the fastest set ever played in a tournament match.  Later, Casey and John Hennessey reached the finals of the Wimbledon doubles.  In an era in which tournament doubles matches were considered almost as important as singles, they lost one of the most famous matches in the early history of tennis, being beaten 4\u20136, 9\u201311, 6\u20134, 6\u20131, 3\u20136 by one of the great French teams of Jean Borotra and Ren\u00e9 Lacoste.
