He had a successful career as session guitarist starting in the late 1960s, and played with Blue Mink, The Congregation, CCS and Serge Gainsbourg.\nMuch of his session work has gone uncredited, but he has been named as the electric guitarist on Donovan's \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\", the Walker Brothers' \"No Regrets\", David Bowie's \"1984\", Mike Batt's \"The Ride to Agadir\" and the Top of the Pops theme music version of \"Whole Lotta Love\".Parker's later work comprised compositions for film and television. His television work includes Angels, Minder, One Summer, The Glory Boys, Dempsey and Makepeace, French Fields, Room at the Bottom, Red Fox, ITN's News At Ten, and the BBC series Walking with Cavemen and Coast. His film scores include Jaws 3-D (1983), American Gothic (1988), What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993) and Alex Rider: Stormbreaker (2006).\nParker is also known to have owned Jimi Hendrix's Epiphone acoustic guitar, which was given to him by Hendrix in March 1970. He is also the father in law of the comedian and actor Ben Miller.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Three Week Hero", "response": ["*Alan Parker \u2013 electric guitar"]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Alan Parker"]}, {"page": "Allan Holdsworth", "response": ["Holdsworth first recorded in 1969 with the band 'Igginbottom on their lone release, 'Igginbottom's Wrench (later reissued under the group name of \"Allan Holdsworth & Friends\").

With Scott's departure, Bowie produced the album himself. Keith Harwood, who had worked previously with the Rolling Stones on numerous sessions, and on Led Zeppelin's Houses of the Holy, handled engineering duties. Pegg writes that despite Bowie and Harwood's previous collaborations on Mott the Hoople's All the Young Dudes and the original version of \"John, I'm Only Dancing\" (both 1972), Diamond Dogs was Harwood's first credit on a Bowie album. Bowie described being \"in awe\" of Harwood because of his work with the Stones. With the departure of the Spiders from Mars, Bowie handled lead guitar duties. He recalled in 1997 that he practiced every day knowing \"the guitar playing had to be more than okay\". This surprised NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, producing what they described as a \"scratchy, raucous, semi-amateurish sound that gave the album much of its characteristic flavour\". Pianist Mike Garson and drummer Aynsley Dunbar returned from the Pin Ups sessions, Tony Newman also played drums while Herbie Flowers, who had played previously on Space Oddity (1969), was recruited to play bass. Alan Parker of Blue Mink played guest guitar on \"1984\" and \"augmented\" Bowie's riff on \"Rebel Rebel\", although he was only credited for \"1984\". Bowie's longtime friend Geoff MacCormack, now known as Warren Peace, sang backing vocals. Diamond Dogs was a milestone in Bowie's career as it reunited him with Tony Visconti, who provided string arrangements and helped mix the album at his studio in London. Visconti would go on to co-produce much of Bowie's work for the rest of the decade.", "Multiple biographers cite the suite of \"Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing (Reprise)\" as the album's highlight. Pegg describes Bowie's vocal performance, which he believes to be one of his finest, as a croon. \"Sweet Thing\" paints pictures of decay, with sex being a \"drug-like commodity\" while \"Candidate\" contains references to Charles Manson and Muhammad Ali, with Bowie being \"consumed by the fakery of his own stage creations\". Cited by Pegg as Bowie's most covered track, \"Rebel Rebel\" is based around a distinctive guitar riff reminiscent of the Rolling Stones and was his farewell to the glam rock era. The song features guest guitar by Alan Parker who, according to Pegg, \"added the three descending notes at the end of each loop of the riff\". It features a character who predates 1970s punk rock and gender-bending lyrics (\"You got your mother in a whirl / She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl\"). Some commentators praised the song itself but felt it did not contribute to the overall theme of the album.
