He scored two goals for Newcastle since relegation, a header at Cardiff City, and another header at Watford. The club was eventually promoted back to the Premier League as champions, and Coloccini's great contributions awarded him a place in the Championship's Team of the Year. Coloccini scored his third Newcastle goal against Wigan Athletic in the fourth minute of injury time as they came from two goals down to draw 2\u20132 at St James' Park, with that being his first goal in the Premier League on the same day that he captained Newcastle for the first time. Coloccini scored a striker's finish in a 1\u20131 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on 22 January 2011, the day of his 29th birthday and his 100th Newcastle appearance.", "He continued his fine form for Newcastle into April, reforming his partnership with Mike Williamson after a brief time with Steven Taylor in January. On 2 April, Coloccini made numerous forward runs and forward roaming to help supply Peter L\u00f8venkrands' goal in the 4\u20131 win over Wolves. Manager Alan Pardew, along with pundit Jamie Redknapp complimented the defender for his contributions to the team's attack, calling him a \"top, top player\"."]}, {"page": "Steven Taylor (footballer)", "response": ["However, during pre-season for the 2010\u201311 season, Taylor dislocated his shoulder in a friendly against Carlisle United, ruling him out for up to four months. In August, it was reported that he was transfer-listed due to unresolved contract issues but no transfer was made. In an interview after Newcastle's cup tie with Accrington Stanley, manager Chris Hughton said he was still hopeful a contract could be negotiated. On 28 November, Taylor marked his return by putting in a solid performance in a 1\u20131 home draw against Chelsea, partnering with Sol Campbell as stand-ins for the suspended Coloccini and Mike Williamson."]}, {"page": "Chris Hughton", "response": ["A positive start to the 2009\u201310 season saw Hughton win successive Manager of the Month awards for August and September and then again in November, resulting in the board naming him as the new permanent manager of the club, after two stints as caretaker. Hughton's league start to his managerial career was the best in Newcastle's history. In January, Newcastle signed Mike Williamson, Wayne Routledge and Leon Best in permanent transfers and Fitz Hall and Patrick van Aanholt on loan. On 5 April 2010, Newcastle, under Hughton's control, confirmed their promotion back to the Premier League prior to a match against Sheffield United, after Nottingham Forest failed to win their match against Cardiff City. They then went on to win the game 2\u20131 with a Peter L\u00f8venkrands penalty and a bicycle kick-goal from Kevin Nolan to earn them a place back in the Premier League after just one season away. Newcastle then went on to clinch the Championship title on 19 April 2010 after a 2\u20130 victory over Plymouth Argyle, winning 30, drawing 12 and losing just 4 of their 46 matches.
