The name \"Dora Greenwell\" was for many years supposed to be the pseudonym of a writer of rare spiritual insight and fine poetic genius. It was very generally surmised that she was a member of the Society of Friends; and there was much ground for this supposition. As time wore on, and book followed book, some of the facts of her personal history became known and were occasionally referred to in the public press. But for a very long period little was really known of her actual life, and many mistakes gained currency.Her poem, \"I Am Not Skilled to Understand\" was set to music by William J. Kirkpatrick. A contemporary version of it, \"My Savior My God\", is a 2006 radio single by contemporary Christian musician, Aaron Shust, from his album, Anything Worth Saying.", "link_mentions": {}}}
