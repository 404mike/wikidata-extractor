He was invited to present a live astronomy programme and said the greatest difficulty was finding an appropriate theme tune; the opening of Jean Sibelius's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande was chosen and used throughout the programme's existence. The programme was originally named Star Map before The Sky at Night was chosen in the Radio Times. On 24 April 1957, at 10:30 pm, Moore presented the first episode about the Comet Arend\u2013Roland. The programme was pitched to casual viewers up to professional astronomers, in a format which remained consistent from its inception. Moore presented every monthly episode except for one in July 2004 when he suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning caused by eating a contaminated goose egg and was replaced for that episode by Chris Lintott. Moore appears in the Guinness World Records book as the world's longest-serving TV presenter having presented the programme since 1957. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was broadcast from Moore's home, when arthritis prevented him from travelling to the studios. Over the years he received many lucrative offers to take his programme onto other networks, but rejected them because he held a 'gentlemen's agreement' with the BBC.", "He was a friend of Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, who was an occasional guest on The Sky at Night. May bought Moore's Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book Bang! The Complete History of the Universe. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy for Cambridge University Press. In 1986 he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called Flying Saucer from Mars, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers;Allan, C. and Campbell, S.

Kevin Schawinski, a co-founder of the website Galaxy Zoo, stated: \"We think that in the recent past the galaxy IC 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar. Because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the Voorwerp, light from that past still lights up the nearby Voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100,000 years, and the galaxy's black hole itself has gone quiet.\" Chris Lintott, also a co-founder of Galaxy Zoo stated: \"From the point of view of the Voorwerp, the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned offit's this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe.\" The analysis of HsV in turn has led to the study of objects called Voorwerpjes and Green bean galaxies."]}, {"page": "Galaxy Zoo", "response": ["A key factor leading to the creation of the project was the problem of what has been referred to as data deluge, where research produces vast sets of information to the extent that research teams are not able to analyse and process much of it. Kevin Schawinski, previously an astrophysicist at Oxford University and co-founder of Galaxy Zoo, described the problem that led to Galaxy Zoo's creation when he was set the task of classifying the morphology of more than 900,000 galaxies by eye that had been imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, USA. \"I classified 50,000 galaxies myself in a week, it was mind-numbing.\" Chris Lintott, a co-founder of the project and a professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford, stated: \"In many parts of science, we're not constrained by what data we can get, we're constrained by what we can do with the data we have. Citizen science is a very powerful way of solving that problem.\"", "Chris Lintott commented that: \"One advantage is that you get to see parts of space that have never been seen before. These images were taken by a robotic telescope and processed automatically, so the odds are that when you log on, that first galaxy you see will be one that no human has seen before.\" This was confirmed by Kevin Schawinski: \"Most of these galaxies have been photographed by a robotic telescope, and then processed by computer. So this is the first time they will have been seen by human eyes.\".", "As of July 2017, 60 scientific papers have been published as a direct result of Galaxy Zoo and hundreds of thousands of volunteers. In previous studies though, it was found that data produced by volunteers was more likely to contain bias or mistakes. However Chris Lintott says that crowdsourced results are reliable, as proven by the fact that they are being used and published in peer-reviewed science papers. Indeed, other scientists have questioned crowdsourcing and crowdsourced studies. Steven Bamford, a Galaxy Zoo research scientist, stated: \"As a professional researcher you take pride in the work that you do. And the idea that anybody off the street could come and do something better sounds threatening but also implausible.\" David Anderson, the founder of BOINC, stated: [For many sceptical scientists] \"There's this idea that they're giving up control somehow, and that their importance would be diminished\". The continuing goodwill of citizen scientists is also questioned. Chris Lintott stated: \"Rather than letting anyone pitch for volunteers, we'd like to be a place where people can come and expect a certain level of commitment\".", "A conference was held between 10\u201312 July 2017 at St. Catherine's College, Oxford, to recognise the tenth anniversary of the start of Galaxy Zoo in July 2007. Co-founder Chris Lintott stated: \"What started as a small project has been completely transformed by the enthusiasm and efforts of the volunteers... It has had a real impact on our understanding of galaxy evolution.\" 125 million galaxy classifications resulting in 60 peer reviewed academic papers from at least 15 different projects have been made since July 2007. Discoveries include: Hanny's Voorwerp, Green pea galaxies and more recently objects known as 'Yellow Balls'. On the conference Twitter feed, #GZ10, it states that 10 of the 60 papers have over 100 citations [within the Astrophysics Data System] in 10 years. Karen Masters, an astrophysicist at Portsmouth University and project scientist for GZ stated: \"We're genuinely asking for help with something we cannot do ourselves and the results have made a big contribution to the field.\" As a result of GZ's success, the citizen science web portal Zooniverse was started, which has since hosted a 100 projects.", "Also, a population of red spirals was found. These have a different evolutionary path from normal spiral galaxies, showing red spiral galaxies can stop making new stars without changing their shape. Using Galaxy Zoo data for their sample, Tojeiro et al. 2013 found (pg.5): 13,959 red ellipticals, 381 blue ellipticals, 5,139 blue late-type spirals, 294 red late-type spirals, 1,144 blue early-type spirals, and 1,265 red early-type spirals. Chris Lintott stated: \"These red spiral galaxies had been lurking in the data and no-one had spotted them. They were staring us in the face. Now we know that a third of spirals around the edges of some clusters of galaxies are red.\" He also stated: \"These results are possible thanks to a major scientific contribution from our many volunteer armchair astronomers. No group of professionals could have classified this many galaxies alone.\" A team using the Hubble Space telescope has independently verified the existence of red spirals. Meghan Gray stated: \"Our two projects have approached the problem from very different directions. It is gratifying to see that we each provide independent pieces of the puzzle pointing to the same conclusion.\"", "It is thought that Red Spirals are galaxies in the process of transition from young to old. They are more massive than blue spirals and are found on the outskirts of large clusters of galaxies. Chris Lintott stated: \"We think what we\u2019re seeing is galaxies that have been gently strangled, so to speak, where somehow the gas supply for star formation has been cut off, but that they\u2019ve been strangled so gently that the arms are still there.\" The cause might be the Red Spiral's gentle interaction with a galaxy cluster. He further explained: \"The kind of thing we\u2019re imagining [is that] as the galaxy moves into a denser environment, there\u2019s lot of gas in clusters as well as galaxies, and it\u2019s possible the gas from the galaxy just gets stripped off by the denser medium it\u2019s plowing into.\""]}, {"page": "Astronomy Ireland", "response": ["* Lectures: These are recorded by the society and are made available on for download and via DVD.
