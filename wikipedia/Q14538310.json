Two English Romantics are largely responsible for raising the status of landscape painting worldwide: John Constable (1776\u20131837) and J. M. W. Turner (1775\u20131851), who is credited with elevating landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting. Other notable 18th and 19th century landscape painters include: George Arnald (1763\u20131841); John Linnell (1792\u20131882), a rival to Constable in his time; George Morland (1763\u20131804), who developed on Francis Barlow's tradition of animal and rustic painting; Samuel Palmer (1805\u20131881); Paul Sandby (1731\u20131809), who is recognised as the father of English watercolour painting; and subsequent watercolourists John Robert Cozens (1752\u20131797), Turner's friend Thomas Girtin (1775\u20131802), and Thomas Heaphy (1775\u20131835).", "File:Palmerston 1802.jpg|Thomas Heaphy's portrait of Palmerston; 1802."]}, {"page": "1835 in art", "response": ["* October 23 \u2013 Thomas Heaphy, English watercolour and portrait painter (born 1775)"]}, {"page": "Colin Campbell (British Army officer, born 1776)", "response": ["Campbell can be seen in three works at the National Portrait Gallery:Sir Colin Campbell in the National Portrait Gallery collection a pencil and watercolour sketch by Thomas Heaphy (1803), an oil on canvas by William Salter (c1834), and in the group Field Marshall the Duke of Wellington KG &c &c Giving Orders to his Generals Previous to a General Action by Thomas Heaphy (1822).
