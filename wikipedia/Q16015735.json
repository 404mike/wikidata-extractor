He started off as a player of the English diatonic accordion, but was best known as a harmonica or moothie player. His playing was distinguished by a very clear sense of rhythm, with a definite lilt. He was a major figure in Northumbrian music. He was also the composer of several tunes that have entered the tradition and are played at gatherings and sessions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of folk musicians", "response": ["*Will Atkinson"]}, {"page": "Kathryn Tickell", "response": ["Kathryn Tickell was born in Walsall, then in Staffordshire, to parents who originated from Northumberland and who moved back there with the family when Kathryn was seven. Her paternal grandfather played accordion, fiddle, and organ. Her father, Mike Tickell, sang and her mother played the concertina. Her first instrument was piano when she was six. A year later, she picked up a set of Northumbrian smallpipes brought home by her father, who intended them for someone else. Frustrated by fiddle and piano, she learned that the pipes rewarded her effort. She was inspired by older musicians such as Willy Taylor, Will Atkinson, Joe Hutton, and Billy Pigg."]}, {"page": "Music of Northumbria", "response": ["Free reed instruments have been of growing importance since their development in the nineteenth century.

Going back to listen to traditional musicians like Bob Cann and Scan Tester was a good start. Remembering that these were social dances, not a precious art form, gave licence to all sorts of creative cavorting. Of these new bands, Old Swan Band, Flowers and Frolics, Umps and Dumps, Pump and Pluck seemed to concentrate more on Southern English styles and repertoire. The New Victory Band developed a more Northerly aspect, listening to recordings of George Tremain, Ned Pearson, Adam Gray, Willie Taylor & Will Atkinson."]}, {"page": "1908 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 31 January \u2013 Will Atkinson, folk musician (died 2003)"]}, {"page": "Will Atkinson (Musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Will Atkinson (musician) "]}, {"page": "Geoff Heslop", "response": ["*Harthope Burn (Joe Hutton, Will Atkinson and Willy Taylor)", "Joe Hutton, Willy Taylor, Will Atkinson, Mike Tickell, Allan Wood,", "*Mouthorgan (Will Atkinson) (with Alistair Anderson)"]}, {"page": "Joe Hutton (piper)", "response": ["In retirement after 1978, he continued to play,  making a solo record Joe Hutton of Coquetdale MWM Records 1024(1980).
