However, over the course of the following two years Abbott's work on the series decreased as he moved on to other projects. Nonetheless, every series was nominated for a BAFTA and other writers including Danny Brocklehurst, John Fay and Jan McVerry wrote successful stand-alone episodes. The programme finally ended, after a series with no Abbott scripts at all, in 2003. The BBC said the programme was axed following declining ratings, but creator Abbott said the programme's demise was down to \"a lack of writers able to come up with stories good enough to carry the stand alone episodes.\""]}, {"page": "Torchwood", "response": [" The other episodes were written by James Moran, Matt Jones, J.

John Fay wrote episodes two and four.", "For the fourth series, Miracle Day, Davies secured several popular US television writers, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer Jane Espenson; The X-Files, Star Trek: Enterprise and Supernatural writer John Shiban; and House writer Doris Egan. Additionally, both Davies and John Fay returned to write episodes. In continuing the series Davies chose to keep Torchwood more focused on the human condition than its science fiction backdrop. He drew inspiration from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, noting that \"the best metaphors in Buffy came down to, 'What's it like to be in high school, as a kid?'\" He felt the fourth series of Torchwood to be \"about us and our decisions and our lives, and how we live with each other and how we die with each other\". The depiction of human nature in the fourth series led to a sequence which many felt to be evocative of the Holocaust. Jane Espenson noted that as a series Torchwood \"is willing to go to horrible places\". She stated that in storylining Miracle Day, the writers \"didn't want to flinch away from what mankind can do\"."]}, {"page": "Gwen Cooper", "response": ["Eve Myles won the 2007 Bafta Cymru Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Gwen Cooper, winning over the parent series' actress Billie Piper.

In 2010 Myles won the 'Best Actress\" award in the SFX Reader's Awards poll, and was crowned best actress in the 11th annual Airlock Alpha Portal Awards. For her role as Gwen Cooper in Torchwood: Miracle Day Myles was nominated for a Satellite Award in the Best Television Actress category,2011 Satellite Award Nominations and reached the shortlist for the 2012 UK National Television Awards. She has also received a nomination for Best Actress in Television at the 38th Saturn Awards, held in June 2012. Action figures of Gwen have been created in her likeness, which Myles' describes as \"bizarre and wonderful\" and at the same time \"really kind of strange\". In a reader's awards poll in the sixth issue of Torchwood Magazine, Gwen was voted second favourite Torchwood character behind Captain Jack, a ranking she received in a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live interview with writer John Fay. Myles, describing her experiences at various science-fiction conventions, has praised the fan response as \"incredible\" and \"just extraordinary\".

ITV decided to move its flagship programme from 19:30 to 20:30 on Monday nights, to provide a successful lead-in for Celebrity Love Island, in the hope of increasing ratings. Writers John Fay and Daran Little complained to the press about the treatment of the show. ITV argued that it took the decision to move the soap very seriously and only did so when absolutely necessary.

However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing \"unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll was the subject of a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome\". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans \"suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious\". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it was time to move on, \"while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate\", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as \"sickening\" and quoted \"crazed\" fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called \"completely unacceptable\". David-Lloyd added that he \"would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that\". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the \"ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions\" of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as \"thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, and doing what we can to be supportive of the character and actor\". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: \"Not reversing it. Stop asking.\" In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding \"indifferent\" and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the \"scary\" fan reaction, maintaining that \"a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting\"."]}, {"page": "List of time travel works of fiction", "response": ["| Russell T DaviesChris ChibnallJane EspensonJohn Fay"]}, {"page": "Mobile (TV series)", "response": ["Mobile is a British television drama series, broadcast over three episodes, each featuring part of an interweaving plot involving a fictional mobile phone operator and the adverse-effect of mobile phone radiation to health.
