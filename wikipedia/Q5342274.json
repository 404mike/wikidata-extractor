He studied medicine but abandoned a career in this discipline in 1836 to work in the British Museum. He was interested in the Crag fossils of East Anglia and in the period 1835\u20131838 debated with Charles Lyell on the age and nature of the Crag formations. At this time he took over the Magazine of Natural History associated  with William Bean. The Magazine of Natural History is, in contemporary scientific literature, often referred to as Charlesworth's Magazine.\nCharlesworth was the second keeper of the Yorkshire Museum, from 1844\u20131858, following on from John Phillips and preceding Charles Wakefield (only in post for 6 months) and William Dallas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Megalodon", "response": ["Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz gave this shark its initial scientific name, Carcharodon megalodon, in his 1843 work Recherches sur les poissons fossiles, based on tooth remains. English paleontologist Edward Charlesworth in his 1837 paper used the name Carcharias megalodon, while citing Agassiz as the author, indicating that Agassiz described the species prior to 1843. English paleontologist Charles Davies Sherborn in 1928 listed an 1835 series of articles by Agassiz as the first scientific description of the shark. The specific name megalodon translates to \"big tooth\", from  and \u1f40\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (odo\u00fas), \"tooth\". The teeth of megalodon are morphologically similar to those of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and on the basis of this observation, Agassiz assigned megalodon to the genus Carcharodon. Though \"megalodon\" is an informal name for the shark, it is also often informally dubbed the \"giant white shark\", the \"megatooth shark\", the \"big tooth shark\", or \"Meg\"."]}, {"page": "George Crawford Hyndman", "response": ["The Ulster Museum has an 1854-62 archive  of  George Crawford Hyndman containing 20 letters from Francis Archer, Edward Benn, J.

Considering the large number of bones found, and the unusually perfect state in which they had been disinterred, this discovery Mr Charlesworth considered to be the most remarkable of the kind that had ever occurred in this country ... the cavern at Kirkdale with its numerous remains of huge Hyenas, was well known ... and at the farm called Bielbeck, near Market Weighton, was another celebrated locality for fossil bones of the extinct Elephant and other large quadrupeds ... The Museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society possessed large collections from both these localities, but no remains of the Hippopotamus were found at Beil-beck Farm, and very few in the cavern at Kirkdale. Indeed, so rare are the remains of this animal in the fossil state, that the bones found at Leeds probably equal in number the united collections of all the other Museums in the kingdom."]}]}}
