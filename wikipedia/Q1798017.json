Sierz Remarked that Herbert \"chose the more direct \"in-yer-face\" formulation over the more staid \"in-your-face\"\". After Herbert's writings in Theatre Record the phrase began to be used by other critics and, according to Sierz, \"By the time Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking opened at the Royal Court in October 1996, the expression was spreading rapidly\".", "Sierz first cites Ian Brown, artistic director of Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre, who during the late 1980s started looking \"for provocative plays from Canada and America\" to be staged at the theatre, namely those written by Brad Fraser and Tracy Letts. Brown described himself as \"a risk-taker; I had a taste for doing plays that are a bit between-the-eyes: most London theatres didn't dare put on Brad Fraser['s plays] because of the explicit sex\". Fraser has been hailed by director Dominic Dromgoole as \"the early prophet, the John the Baptist of the brutalist school that flourished in the mid-nineties. A lot of tricks that tired by the end of the Nineties, the rimming, the sadism, the antibodies, the sexual frankness, the cool irony in the face of outrage, began with Fraser\". Brown also developed \"Scottish work with Scottish actors\" such as the \"provocative\" 1992 play The Life of Stuff written by \"local actor\" Simon Donald. Sierz has said that Brown unknowingly was \"opening the long road that led to Anthony Neilson, to Mark Ravenhill (who was influenced by the work of Canadian Brad Fraser) and to that 1990s youth anthem, Trainspotting\". ", "In 2004 the playwright Mark Ravenhill gave a lecture entitled 'A Tear in the Fabric: the James Bulger Murder and New Theatre Writing in the 1990s'. In this lecture Ravenhill explained how the Bulger murder prompted him to make his \"first attempt at writing a play\". Ravenhill believes that the murder may have inspired other playwrights from the 1990s: \"I wonder if I was alone? I doubt it. I wonder how many other people there were who started to write with that CCTV picture of the boy led away somewhere in their head? [\u2026] How many of the young British playwrights of the 1990s \u2014 the so-called in-yer-face playwrights \u2014 were driven, consciously or unconsciously, by that moment?\" ", "Other notable in-yer-face plays that The Royal Court programmed while Daldry was artistic director include Penetrator (1994) by Anthony Neilson, Mojo (1995) by Jez Butterworth, The Beauty Queen of Leenane (1996) by Martin McDonagh, Shopping and Fucking (1996) by Mark Ravenhill and The Censor (1997) by Anthony Neilson.", "In 2004 Sierz hosted a debate on New Writing, which featured the playwrights Mark Ravenhill, Simon Stephens and Richard Bean as panellists. An audience member asked the panel if they thought that in-yer-face theatre \"was now no longer at the forefront\" of new writing. Bean responded by saying \"I think it's quite true that things have moved on\". He explained how it no longer is seen as shocking or cutting edge to have sex scenes in plays, stating that \"I suppose there came a point where if you went to The Royal Court and somebody got their knob out and spat in their hand, and you think 'oh here we go again'\". Sierz added to this comment by jokingly remarking how previously \"there was a time in the 1990s that if you didn't see an anal rape on stage, you asked for your money back\". Bean pointed out how his 2004 play Honeymoon Suite contained \"two fucks and a wank\" yet critics felt it was a \"very commercial play\" and thus wondered why it was \"being put on on the main stages of The Royal Court?\" Bean felt that this reaction from critics demonstrated how \"obviously all that kind of gross behaviour is now perfectly acceptable\" in plays. Stephens, who has tutored at The Royal Court's Young Writers' Programme, responded to the question by saying that: \"It's fascinating now giving copies of Blasted to a group of young writers in The Young Writers Programme, and they find it completely alien and completely tedious and completely disinteresting. [\u2026] They're responding to it with anger, which I find really bracing.\" He went on to say that he thought this anger towards the play was because \"in the wake of [Blasted and] that initial rush of very strong [in-yer-face] plays, an awful lot of lesser plays were written by pale imitators so that images of anal rape became tedious and became kind of signatures. And I think they're maybe not distinguishing between the people who are original with those plays and their imitators, and they just find it a little bit gratuitous [\u2026] not gratuitous because it's offensive, but gratuitous because it's boring now.\"THE THEATREVOICE DEBATE: NEW WRITING Audio recording and Transcript.

Their premiere productions of Osborne's A Patriot for Me and Saved by Edward Bond (both 1965) necessitated the theatre turning itself into a 'private members club' to circumvent the Lord Chamberlain, formally responsible for the licensing of plays until the Theatres Act 1968. The succ\u00e8s de scandale of the two plays helped to bring about the abolition of theatre censorship in the UK. During the period of Devine's directorship, besides Osborne and Bond, the Royal Court premiered works by Arnold Wesker, John Arden, Ann Jellicoe and N.F. Simpson. Subsequent Artistic Directors of the Royal Court premiered work by Christopher Hampton, Athol Fugard, Howard Brenton, Caryl Churchill, Hanif Kureishi, Sarah Daniels, Errol John, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Martin Crimp, Sarah Kane, Sylvia Wynter, Mark Ravenhill, Martin McDonagh, Simon Stephens, Leo Butler, Polly Stenham and Nick Payne.

By the early 1990s the theatre had deteriorated dangerously, and it was threatened with closure in 1995. The Royal Court received a grant of \u00a316.2\u00a0million from the National Lottery and the Arts Council for redevelopment, and beginning in 1996, under the artistic directorship of Stephen Daldry, it was completely rebuilt, except for the fa\u00e7ade and the intimate auditorium.

Since 1994, a new generation of playwrights debuting at the theatre has included Joe Penhall, Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, and Roy Williams, among others.
