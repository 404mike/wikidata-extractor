The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by Nazi Germany or other Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.   \nHeslop undertook two missions to France, the first from July 1942 to June 1943 and the second and more important mission from September 1943 until September 1944. In his second mission, Heslop was the organiser of the Marksman network (or circuit) assisting one of the largest groups of the French Resistance which operated in the mountainous region near the border with Switzerland.\nOf the more than 400 SOE agents who worked in France during World War II, M.R.D. Foot, the official historian of the SOE, named Heslop as one of a half-dozen best male agents.  Although military rank was not very important in SOE, Heslop was one of only three SOE agents to become a Lt. Colonel along with Francis Cammaerts and George Starr. Heslop's reports to London on his activities were brief, leaving little grist for the historian's mill beyond his book, Xavier, first published in 1970.", "link_mentions": {}}}
