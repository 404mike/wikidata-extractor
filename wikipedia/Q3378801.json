In 1956 he became the first make-up designer ever to receive on-screen credit for \"special\" make-up effects for his \"bold and innovative\" work in X the Unknown.He provided Christopher Lee's celebrated makeup for Hammer's The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), whose \"monster\" had to be memorable and terrifying without infringing the copyright on Universal's earlier makeup, created by Jack Pierce for Boris Karloff.\nLeakey created make-up for Dracula and The Revenge of Frankenstein (both 1958) before leaving Hammer, disgusted by the cost-cutting measure by Hammer's associate producer, Anthony Nelson Keys, of revoking his retainer. His assistant, Roy Ashton, took charge of Hammer make-up from then onwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Cushing", "response": ["Unlike Frankenstein (1931) produced by Universal, the Hammer films revolved mainly around Victor Frankenstein, rather than his monster.O'Flinn, Paul (1983). \"Production and Reproduction: The Case of Frankenstein\". Literature and History. 9.2: 194\u2014213. Screenwriter Jimmy Sangster wrote the protagonist as an ambitious, egotistical and coldly intellectual scientist who despised his contemporaries. Unlike the character from the novel and past film versions, Cushing's Baron Frankenstein commits vicious crimes to attain his goals, including the murder of a colleague to obtain a brain for his creature. The Curse of Frankenstein also featured Christopher Lee, who played Frankenstein's monster. Cushing and Lee became extremely close friends, and remained so for the rest of Cushing's life. They first met on the set of the film, where Lee was still wearing the monster make-up prepared by Phil Leakey. Hammer Studios' publicity department put out a story that when Cushing first encountered Lee without the make-up on, he screamed in terror.Cushing, p. 112"]}, {"page": "The Quatermass Xperiment", "response": ["The screenplay, written by the American B-film scenarist, Richard Landau, and heavily revised by Val Guest, presents a reworked version of the events of the original television serial. Among the plot changes are the elimination of the gangster episode. The most significant plot change, however, occurs at the climax of the film. In the television version, Quatermass appeals to the last vestiges of the creature's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world. In the film Quatermass kills the creature by massive electrocution. Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation, and also of the casting of Brian Donlevy, whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking. To make the film's plot convincing to audiences, Guest employed a high degree of realism, directing the film in a style akin to a newsreel. The film was shot on location in London, Windsor, Bray, and at Hammer's Bray Studios. Carroon's transformation was effected by makeup artist Phil Leakey, who worked in conjunction with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate Wordsworth's naturally gaunt features to give him an increasingly menacing, yet tragically in-pain, appearance. Special effects, including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax, were provided by Les Bowie. The music was composed by James Bernard, the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer.", "thumb|right|alt=A black-and-white screenshot from the film depicting a tall man in a white coat reading a clipboard watched by a man with a moustache wearing a dark suit.

Makeup artist Phil Leakey worked with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate the shadows around Wordworth's face to give him a skeletal appearance.", "The work of makeup artist Phil Leakey in transforming Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature was a key contribution to the effectiveness of the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds, and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed from time to time in the film, were also made by Leakey."]}, {"page": "The Curse of Frankenstein", "response": ["Peter Cushing, who was then best known for his many high-profile roles in British television, had his first lead part in a movie with this film.
