He was a member of the 1966\u201367 side that won both the Third Division Championship and the League Cup, defeating West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132 at Wembley Stadium.Hazell played 369 League games for QPR before transferring to Millwall in 1974, where he played 153 League games. He later had a short spell at Crystal Palace and a little longer with Charlton Athletic before retiring.Following his retirement from football, Hazell worked as a technician for British Telecom.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stan Bowles", "response": ["Bowles was often regarded as something of a character both on and off the pitch. Bowles has been known to cite a notable incident in his playing days involving the famous FA Cup trophy. Having won the FA Cup competition four days prior, Sunderland were parading the trophy at Roker Park on 9 May 1973 when they met QPR in the old Division 2. The trophy had been placed on a table at the side of the pitch when Bowles tore straight across the park and claims to have kicked the ball at it full speed, sending the Cup flying through the air. According to Stan, the crowd predictably went ballistic, but he had the last laugh by scoring two goals in the match which ended in a pitch invasion. Some reports suggest that some of the QPR players had laid bets as to who could hit the trophy first. However this version of events has been disputed and, according to Gordon Jago (QPR's manager at the time), it was Bowles's teammate, defender Tony Hazell, who struck the cup with an accidental clearance."]}, {"page": "Alec Stock", "response": ["It was perhaps Stock's time as manager of Queens Park Rangers where he is most fondly remembered. It was during his spell in the 1960s that coincided with the development of the club with chairman Jim Gregory. The team enjoyed unprecedented success in 1967 and 1968 winning consecutive promotions with the club reaching the First Division for the first time and becoming the first Third Division team to win the Football League Cup in 1967 beating then First Division West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132 in a come from behind win. Stock had a focus on youth bringing many of the team through the club's youth system (including Frank Sibley, Tony Hazell, Roger Morgan, Ian Morgan and Mick Leach) as well as blending characters such as Rodney Marsh and Mark Lazarus into the set up."]}, {"page": "1967 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["| DF ||2 ||\u00a0Tony Hazell"]}, {"page": "Hazell", "response": ["*Tony Hazell (born 1947), British football player"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Football League Cup", "response": ["| ||2 ||Tony Hazell"]}, {"page": "South London derby", "response": ["* Tony Hazell"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Fears that Brentford's largely-unchanged squad would be out of its depth in the Third Division were heightened after the season began with a 7\u20131 aggregate defeat to fellow third-tier side Watford in the first round of the League Cup. A dire start to the league season, which had seen Brentford sink into the relegation places by the end of September 1978, led manager Bill Dodgin Jr. to act in the transfer market. Potentially club-record breaking bids for Watford's Alan Mayes, Queens Park Rangers' Tony Hazell and Bristol City's John Bain were all rejected, but Dodgin did manage to sign defender Jim McNichol and forward Dean Smith, with McNichol's transfer from Luton Town setting a new club-record incoming fee of \u00a330,000. While McNichol would instantly impress and go on to be voted the Supporters' Player of the Year, Smith (who had been signed to support the misfiring Steve Phillips and Andrew McCulloch) would only score sporadically during the rest of the season."]}]}}
