Styling himself as a \"nationalist, fascist, theorist and supporter of white rights\", he ran a blog called The Daily Bale (\"Britons Against Left-wing Extremism\") which published several racist and anti-immigration hoaxes, as well as false accusations against his opponents. He has described himself as \"a proud anti-semite\".Bonehill-Paine's online activity has led to criminal charges being brought against him for harassment, antisemitic commentary and hoaxing, including a 2013 online hoax that led to the owners of a Leicester pub receiving death threats, and other false accusations, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. He was described as an \"internet troll\" by the prosecutor at a 2014 court hearing. He was arrested in June 2015 for inciting racial hatred against Jews, for which he was found guilty in December, receiving a jail sentence of three years and four months. In 2016, he was sentenced to two years in prison for racially-aggravated harassment to be served in addition to his first sentence, and was serving his sentence at HM Prison Wayland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luciana Berger", "response": ["Joshua Bonehill-Paine, a supporter of Garron Helm and a self-described far-right antisemite, was convicted of racially aggravated harassment of Berger in December 2016.
