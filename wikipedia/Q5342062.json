He did experimental work on the perception of colours, and in his theoretical work introduced the concept of psychical distance: that which \"appears to lie between our own self and its affections\" in aesthetic experience. In languages, Bullough was a dedicated teacher who published little. He came to concentrate on Italian, and was elected to the Chair of Italian at Cambridge in 1933.", "link_mentions": {}}}
