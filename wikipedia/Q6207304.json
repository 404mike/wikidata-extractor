However, this Allied push failed, and the 7th Armoured Division was forced to withdraw on the third day of fighting.Liddell Hart, Basil H.. The Tanks: The History of the Royal Tank Regiment and its Predecessors, Heavy Branch, Machine-Gun Corps, Tank Corps, and Royal Tank Corps, 1914\u20131945, pg. 90 On 18 November, as part of Operation Crusader the whole of the 7th Armoured Division was concentrated on breaking through. They faced only the weakened 21st Panzer Division. However, the XXX Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Willoughby Norrie, aware that the 7th Armoured Division was down to 200 tanks, decided on caution. During the wait, in the early afternoon of 22 November, Rommel attacked Sidi Rezegh with the 21st Panzer and captured the airfield. Fighting was desperate and gallant: for his actions during these two days of fighting, Brigadier Jock Campbell, commanding the 7th Support Group, was awarded the Victoria Cross. However, the 21st Panzer, despite being considerably weaker in armour, proved superior in its combined arms tactics, pushing the 7th Armoured back with a further 50 tanks lost (mainly from the 22nd Armoured Brigade)."]}, {"page": "Jock Campbell", "response": ["Jock Campbell may refer to:", "*Jock Campbell (British Army officer) (1894\u20131942), British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*Jock Campbell, Baron Campbell of Eskan (1912\u20131994), British businessman", "*Jock Campbell (footballer) (1922\u20131983), Scottish footballer (Charlton Athletic FC)", "*Jock Campbell (rugby union) (born 1995), Australian rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Jock (given name)", "response": ["* James Jock Campbell (footballer) (1922\u20131983), Scottish footballer", "* John Jock Campbell (British Army officer) (1894-1942), British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* John Jock Campbell, Baron Campbell of Eskan (1912-1994), British businessman"]}, {"page": "Campbell, John Charles", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jock Campbell (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "John Charles Campbell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jock Campbell (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Jock Campbell (VC)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jock Campbell (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "1st Lincolnshire Artillery Volunteers", "response": ["Eighth Army was preparing a new offensive in the Western Desert (Operation Crusader) to drive the Axis forces back from the Egyptian Frontier across Cyrenaica and to relieve Tobruk. For this operation, 60th Fd Rgt was assigned as an additional regiment to 7th Support Group in 7th Armoured Division (a support group at this time was essentially an artillery brigade acting as the pivot group within an armoured division).Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 206\u20139.Playfair, Vol III, p. 45. The operation began at dawn on 18 November 1941, achieving surprise and taking almost all its first day objectives. The next day, 7th Armoured Division began exploitation towards Sidi Rezegh, and on 20 November 7th Support Group was ordered up to join the leading armoured brigade at Sidi Rezegh. On 21 November, 7th Armoured Division with its support group advanced northwards to meet 70th Division breaking out of Tobruk, but both Panzer divisions of the Afrika Korps intervened and bitter fighting broke out (the Battle of Sidi Rezegh). 7th Support Group under Brigadier Jock Campbell attacked Sidi Rezegh with tank support, but came under tank and artillery fire from the north and suffered badly. At one point, 50 German tanks passed through the 7th Hussars to attack S Company and Battalion HQ of 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade but were driven off by anti-tank guns of J Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) and the 25-pounders of 60th Fd Rgt. The RHA detachment fought to the last gun, winning a Victoria Cross (VC) and the Honour title 'Sidi Rezegh' for their battery. Meanwhile, 60th Fd Rgt, deployed round the edge of Sidi Rezegh airfield, were in contact a point-blank range but kept firing despite rising casualties. As about 40 panzers advanced directly towards the guns, one Troop of the regiment moved out onto the airfield itself but was overrun. The RA historian records that 'the whole area was filled with blazing hulks, solid shot ran out and anything to hand was fired'. At dawn the following day the defenders of Sidi Rezegh could see a mass of some 80 tanks and support vehicles advancing against them some three miles away. 60th Field Regiment was very short of men, but Brigadier Campbell himself helped the gunners swing the trails of their guns round to engage these targets, before bringing up a squadron of tanks. This attack was dispersed. Later he stood on the wing of a crashed Italian aircraft to direct the guns of 60th Fd Rgt to scatter another attack. The Afrika Korps then redirected its attack to the east and overran two infantry companies from the rear: once again Campbell helped swing the guns round to face this attack. At the end of the day the regiment was exhausted, but the Germans had never been able to close in. Campbell was later awarded the VC.Lt-Gen Sir Geofrey Evans, 'Crusader: Auchinleck recovers Cyrenaica', in Purnell's History of the Second World War, pp. 740\u201353.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 210\u201314; Maps 45\u20139.Hughes, pp. 188\u201390.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 38\u201349, Maps 7\u20138."]}, {"page": "General Campbell", "response": ["*Jock Campbell (British Army officer) (1894\u20131942), British Army major general"]}]}}
