Cindy tells Simon that she wants to leave, but he replies that the party is just about to start. Later, Cindy tells Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) that she got away from them by crying and claiming she would be late for her school prom."]}, {"page": "EastEnders Live Week", "response": ["During a toast at the reception in The Queen Vic, Jane returns home where she calls Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) over with Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) and asks him to take the boy to his home. Ian catches up with Jane, and Peter walks in with Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) and says he thinks that it was either Cindy, Ian or Jane who killed Lucy.", "* Mimi Keene as Cindy Williams", "After the reveal of Lucy's killer aired, Treadwell-Collins revealed that Eliot Carrington, who portrays Bobby Beale, found out that his character was responsible on Monday 16 February. Bywater mentioned that she found out eight hours prior to the reveal, when she turned up to rehearse the scene. Adam Woodyatt (Ian Beale), Laurie Brett (Jane Beale), Mimi Keene (Cindy Williams) and Ben Hardy (Peter Beale) were told prior to Christmas, in order to film scenes for episodes that will air after live week. Following Friday's live episode, it was revealed that it was the last day that Hardy and Timothy West (Stan Carter) were due to film for EastEnders, as they had already filmed their characters' final scenes, although Hardy later re-shot his final scene with Carrington as Peter and Bobby for the Tuesday 24 February episode.https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/a632215/eastenders-omnibus-airs-different-bobby-and-peter-beale-scene/ Jacqueline Jossa (Lauren Branning), who had also filmed her departure scenes alongside Hardy in December 2014 prior to going on maternity leave, was originally scheduled to appear during the live segments, but the birth of her daughter Ella Osbourne on Sunday 15 February meant that she was unavailable for the live broadcast; Lauren only appeared during the pre-recorded segments.", "Thursday's episodes were described by the Guardian's Hannah Verdier as so much more than just unleashing the whodunnit. Verdier noted that the Fox sisters had their finest moment in a furious confrontation in the Vic. Danny Dyer was described as on form by Verdier and noted that the character of Kat provided light to his shade. She also commented that the most shocking revelation of the night was that Kathy Beale was alive. Following Friday's live episode Verdier noted, that every cast member had performed a blinder and that one could forget that it was live. However she felt that the end was cheesy drawing attention away from the Beale house. On the week as a whole she notes that critics may not be a fan of the Lucy reveal, especially if the Beale family get away with it but for fans it had everything that one wanted from the show. Chris Bennon in the Independent noted that Adam Woodyat \"excelled more than ever\" in a role he has played for 30 years. He also commented that a special mention was needed for Eliot Carrington, who is only 12, who held his own against senior actors in this tricky environment. Writing for the Metro online, Vicky Prior, stated that producers were not far wrong when they said that the square would never be the same again in the buildup to the week. Prior states that Woodyat's performance was of the type only seen by those who are Knights or Dames. She also praised Mimi Keene and Eliot Carrington, calling the pair outstanding and that they seemed unfazed that the programme was live. Prior also praised Dominic Treadwell-Collins for turning the show around and making the 30th Anniversary a success."]}]}}
