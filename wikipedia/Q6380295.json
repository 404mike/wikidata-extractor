She published her novels in Mills & Boon since 1968. All her novels have also been published under Harlequin Enterprises Limited. Over a period of four decades, she has produced a body of sensuous work that investigates heritage, family, class and love. Her forte is to encode the opposing reading within the classic Harlequin plot. A synopsis of the author that accompanies her publications notes that she researched the market for romance fiction before electing to write in this category. Her first book published in North America established her reputation as a gifted storyteller. She has a strong vital writing style.\nAs her career graph began in the late 1960s, Kay Thorpe, along with Charlotte Lamb and others, was one of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflecting the forefront of the \"sexual revolution\" of the 1970s. As such she was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship. However, under Kay Thorpe's expert analysis, the modern romantic heroine had to re-evaluate her age-old perceptions of what constituted love and marriage: she had to accept love unconditionally without looking for security in marriage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlotte Lamb", "response": ["*Dolphin Bay by Gloria Bevan / Festival Summer by Charlotte Lamb / Safari South by Kay Thorpe (1981)"]}, {"page": "Anne Mather", "response": ["* Latin Lovers (2006) (Anne Mather, Kay Thorpe and Michelle Reid)"]}, {"page": "Carole Mortimer", "response": ["*The Innocence Collection (2007) (Innocent Bride by Penny Jordan / Innocent Desires by Carole Mortimer / Innocent Seduction by Kay Thorpe)"]}, {"page": "Margaret Way", "response": ["*The Shifting Sands / Portrait of Jaime / Touched by Fire (1982) (with Jane Donnelly and Kay Thorpe)"]}, {"page": "Sara Craven", "response": ["*To Claim His Mistress (2008) (with Alison Fraser and Kay Thorpe)"]}, {"page": "Anne Weale", "response": ["* Stranger in the Glen / The Man at Kambala / Lord of the Sierras (1978) (with Flora Kidd and Kay Thorpe)"]}, {"page": "Violet Winspear", "response": ["Many established Harlequin novelists such as Robyn Donald and Kay Thorpe, employ sexual antagonism in developing conflict in their stories. These devices are popular with modern readers. For instance, Robyn Donald creates leaping sexual awareness between men and women. Since men are quick to acknowledge this vital force, Robyn casts them into the role of hunter and as women label it as a weakness to despise and overcome, she makes them the prey. This is the adversarial set up that drives her plots forward."]}, {"page": "Flora Kidd", "response": ["*Stranger in the Glen / The Man at Kambala / Lord of the Sierras (1978) (with Kay Thorpe and Anne Weale)"]}, {"page": "Jane Donnelly", "response": ["*The Shifting Sands / Portrait of Jaime / Touched by Fire (1982) (with Kay Thorpe and Margaret Way)"]}, {"page": "Dangerous Moonlight (novel)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kay Thorpe"]}, {"page": "Thorpe (surname)", "response": ["* Kay Thorpe (born 1935), romantic novelist"]}, {"page": "List of works by Penny Jordan", "response": ["*The Innocence Collection (2007) (Innocent Bride by Penny Jordan / Innocent Desires by Carole Mortimer / Innocent Seduction by Kay Thorpe)"]}, {"page": "Eleanor Farnes", "response": ["* The Enchanted Island / The Kindled Fire / Rising Star (1975) (with Essie Summers and Kay Thorpe)"]}, {"page": "List of Harlequin Romance novels released in 1975", "response": ["| # 1909 || The Shifting Sands || Kay Thorpe || September 1975 "]}]}}
