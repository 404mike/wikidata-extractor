Mr Partridge was born in 1885. After leaving school he began a successful music hall career under the stage name of \"Whimsical Willie, the Juggling Joker\". at the height of his career he topped the bill at the Holborn Empire and performed for King George V in the Royal Command Performance at Windsor Castle. In 1914 he joined the British Army and fought on the Western Front until 1916, when he was badly wounded. He was shipped home to England but found that, due to the nature of his injuries, he was unable to return to his music hall career. Initially he tried a brief period as a comic, travelling the American circuit in New Orleans. He subsequently returned to England and started a children's entertainment business, performing Punch and Judy shows and magic tricks as Willie the Wizard. The business was a success and Mr Partridge found himself highly in demand performing for wealthy and respectable families. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Mr Partridge left his business and joined ENSA, performing as a comic entertaining the troops in North Africa and France. After demobilisation in 1945, Mr Partridge found the demand for his services had dwindled and he was forced to take a job as children's entertainer at the Crimpton-on-Sea Maplins Holiday Camp. As the years wore on, Mr Partridge became dispirited by the lack of respect he received from the increasingly bad-mannered children who stayed at the camp. By the early 1950s he was drinking heavily and slipping into seasonal alcoholic benders, and regularly taking it upon himself to discipline the unruly children in a harsh and often violent manner. He is often asked why he is a children's entertainer if he dislikes children so much, a question which remains unanswered. At one point he tried to strangle a boy who was spoiling one of his shows, and it was left up to Ted to save Partridge's job. Mr Partridge also shows on numerous occasions a deep disdain for organised religion, frequently citing it as being responsible for all the trouble in the world.  Yet at the same time, he quotes from the Bible \"thou shalt not make a graven image\" when it suits him and even encourages Ted to set up religious services when the local vicar leaves the camp and he can see a money-making opportunity. During the 1960 season, he became involved with a pub landlady, faked his own death and left the camp to live with her in Cornwall."]}, {"page": "Comedy Playhouse", "response": ["Captive Audience (2 July 1975) starring Derek Fowlds, Daphne Heard, Leslie Dwyer, Cheryl Hall and Leon Vitali"]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Leslie Dwyer,Alfie Bass,Roddy McMillan,Bryan Pringle,Michael Robbins"]}, {"page": "The Goose Steps Out", "response": ["* Leslie Dwyer as German on train (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Seven of One", "response": ["In addition to Barker, Seven of One also featured Roy Castle, Bill Maynard, Talfryn Thomas, Prunella Scales, Glynn Edwards, Joan Sims, Keith Chegwin, Leslie Dwyer, Robin Parkinson, Sam Kelly, Christopher Biggins, Richard O'Callaghan, Yootha Joyce, David Jason, and Avis Bunnage in supporting roles.

He praised the guest cast, though he felt the Drashigs were a mixed bag. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the serial three and a half out of five stars, describing it as \"light and fun\" and praising the Miniscope and guest actor Leslie Dwyer. Neela Debnath of The Independent wrote that Carnival of Monsters had a \"well-crafted plot that keeps the audience guessing for quite a while and this suspense serves as the driving force behind the serial\". She felt that the Drashigs still worked because they were \"such hideous-looking creatures\". On the other hand, IGN reviewer Arnold T. Blumburg named the serial one of the worst of the Pertwee tenure, stating that it had \"the most appalling character, set, and costume design in the era's history\" and that some of the guest actors were wasted. In 2013, Den of Geeks Andrew Blair selected Carnival of Monsters as one of the ten Doctor Who stories that would make great musicals."]}, {"page": "The Way Ahead", "response": ["* Leslie Dwyer as Private Sid Beck"]}, {"page": "The 39 Steps (1959 film)", "response": ["*Leslie Dwyer as Milkman"]}, {"page": "I've Gotta Horse", "response": ["*Leslie Dwyer as Bert"]}, {"page": "Laughter in Paradise", "response": ["*Leslie Dwyer as Police station sergeant "]}, {"page": "The Good Die Young", "response": ["* Leslie Dwyer as Stookey"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1950", "response": ["|Midnight Episode||Gordon Parry||Stanley Holloway, Leslie Dwyer||Mystery||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1956", "response": ["|Cloak Without Dagger||Joseph Sterling||Philip Friend, Mary Mackenzie, Leslie Dwyer||Thriller||", "|Not So Dusty||Maclean Rogers||Bill Owen, Leslie Dwyer ||Comedy||"]}, {"page": "Temptation Harbour", "response": ["*Leslie Dwyer as Reg"]}, {"page": "When the Bough Breaks (1947 film)", "response": ["* Leslie Dwyer as George "]}, {"page": "East London Cemetery", "response": ["* Leslie Dwyer"]}, {"page": "Stormy Crossing", "response": ["Stormy Crossing is a 1958 British crime, drama, thriller, mystery film directed by C.M.
