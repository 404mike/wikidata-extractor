An all-rounder, Wainwright helped to establish the county at the top under Lord Hawke's captaincy, during the early years of County Championship cricket. He also appeared in five Test matches for England, although without any real international success.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1893 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five All\u2013Round Cricketers \u2013 George Giffen, Alec Hearne, Stanley Jackson, Harry Trott, Ted Wainwright"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Ted Wainwright"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Hawke succeeded Emmett in 1883 and remained as official captain for 27 years, but at first he was careful to take his time and did not make too many changes. Yorkshire improved in 1883 and finished second behind Nottinghamshire in the unofficial County Championship. However, the remainder of the 1880s was disappointing for the team and its supporters. Kilburn said that Yorkshire \"continued to be an unreliable side, mingling brilliant achievement with miserable performance\". The basic problem was that the older players were past their peak while younger replacements did not make the progress expected. A poor season on the field in 1889 was reflected by reduced income and changes were made with several good new players being introduced. These included Jack Brown, David Hunter and Stanley Jackson, while Bobby Peel was becoming increasingly effective as a bowling all-rounder. They were followed by John Tunnicliffe, David Denton, Ted Wainwright and George Hirst. Hawke worked on fielding practice and the players became specialised and efficient as fielders.", "* Ted Wainwright"]}, {"page": "Neville Cardus", "response": ["In the spring of 1912, in search of a change from his unrewarding clerical job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket.Brookes, p. 64 and Cardus: Autobiography, p. 59 He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, he would be able to finance his winter studies of music and literature.Cardus: Autobiography, pp. 60\u201361 His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Walter Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional, and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright.Brookes, p. 64 Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: \"Because of Alington I call myself\u00a0... an old Salopian\".Cardus: Autobiography, p. 81 Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea.Daniels, p. 15 In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.Brookes, p. 65 and Cardus: Autobiography, p. 81"]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["Hawke got what he wanted in 1893 as his new Yorkshire team fulfilled its promise and won the County Championship, the club's first-ever title. It was achieved by what Hodgson called \"a cumulative effort\", although the standout players were Ted Wainwright, Hirst and Peel; and was the \"first confirmation of Hawke's striving for teamwork and discipline\".Hodgson, p. 59. Hawke himself played in only 11 matches that season and George Ulyett deputised for him as team captain. Hawke scored 241 runs at 15.06 with two half-centuries. With the title won by a team built on his principles and under his direction, Hawke established himself the de facto supremo of Yorkshire cricket. His captaincy had changed the character of cricket in the county and, for himself, he enjoyed cricket both as a pastime and in terms of his own growing influence upon it. In Kilburn's view, Hawke \"accepted authority and the responsibilities of authority; he assumed the responsibilities of leadership and exercised them with determination to lead\"."]}, {"page": "Archie MacLaren", "response": ["MacLaren's teaching duties meant that in 1897 he again missed the start of the cricket season, and he felt it necessary to resign as Lancashire's captain. When he began playing, he scored heavily, including another double century against Kent, and his runs helped Lancashire to win the County Championship:Down (1981), p. 45. concentrating on aggressive batting, he scored faster than in previous years, and hit 974 runs at 51.26.Wynne-Thomas, pp. 67\u201368. At the end of the season, MacLaren was included in Stoddart's second Australian touring team. Despite high expectations of success, the Test series was lost 4\u20131. Although nominally captain, Stoddart played in only two Tests; he was grief-stricken after the death of his mother and disillusioned by the failures of his team.Gibson, pp. 69\u201370. MacLaren, after an unproductive start to the tour, scored 142 and 100 against New South Wales to become the first batsman to score two centuries in the same Australian first-class match.Down (1981), p. 47. In the absence of Stoddart, he captained the England team in the first Test.Down (1981), pp. 47\u201348. He scored 109 in the first innings, batting more cautiously than usual, and 50 not out in the second as England won by nine wickets.Down (1981), pp. 48\u201349. His captaincy proved controversial when he refused to recall the Australian batsman Charlie McLeod to the wickets after he was dismissed; McLeod was out to a no-ball but, being deaf, did not hear the umpire's call and was run out when he left his crease.Gibson, p. 70. With Stoddart still absent, MacLaren was captain in the second Test. Australia won by an innings, and MacLaren was criticised in the Australian press for complaining about the pitch.Down (1981), p. 49. Commentators also suggested that he underused the bowling of Ted Wainwright.Down (1981), p. 50. Stoddart returned for the third and fourth Tests, both of which England lost by an innings. MacLaren scored 124 in the third game, but was mocked in the press after the fourth when he claimed that a fly in his eye caused him to be dismissed. When Stoddart withdrew from the final match, MacLaren once more assumed the leadership. He scored 65 in the first innings but could not prevent Australia winning again.Down (1981), p. 51."]}, {"page": "Bobby Peel", "response": ["In first-class matches during 1892, Peel scored 772 runs at 19.79 and took 121 wickets at 16.80. Additionally, in a non-first-class games against Leicestershire, he scored 226 as well as taking five wickets in Leicestershire's first innings. In the 1893 season, he took slightly more wickets at a lower average (126 at 14.51) but his run aggregate fell to 550 runs at 13.75. He was part of a successful Yorkshire team. The county won their first official County Championship title and the team was no longer as dependent on Peel with the ball\u2014Ted Wainwright took more wickets than he did.Hodgson, p. 59. The Australians toured England once again, but Peel played in just one of the three Test matches. He did not take a wicket, did little with the bat, and was left out of the team for the second Test. As the Australians had proved poor on the field, Lord Hawke withdrew Peel and Stanley Jackson from the team for the third Test so that they could play for Yorkshire.Knox, pp. 242\u201343. In 1894, Peel scored 699 runs at 16.25, failing to score a half-century. With the ball, he took 145 wickets at 13.44. During the season, he was awarded a benefit match at Bradford, which raised \u00a32,000.Hodgson, p. 251. The retirement of George Ulyett that season made Peel the team's senior professional, an important position at the time.Coldham, p. 108."]}, {"page": "George Hirst", "response": ["Over the next few seasons, Hirst became a regular member of the Yorkshire side, but although his performances were good enough to keep him in the team, he had few outstanding successes. Wisden noted: \"For some time after his first season Hirst's career was one of steady progress rather than of brilliant achievement.\" Hirst's batting remained undeveloped in 1893; he batted at number 10 and did not pass fifty in any one innings, though he managed some useful scores.Thomson, p. 28. He averaged only 15.04 with the bat, but his bowling continued to make a good impression on critics. He took 99 wickets at an average of 14.39, placing him third in the Yorkshire averages for the season; that year, the county won the official County Championship, which had begun in 1890, for the first time. In 1894, Hirst scored his maiden first-class century against Gloucestershire, hitting an unbeaten 115 out of a partnership of 176 for the ninth wicket. Although this was his only score over fifty, Wisden recorded how his batting often helped his team out of difficult situations.Thomson, p. 29. In total, he hit 564 runs at an average of 16.58. With the ball, his record was similar to the previous season. He took 98 wickets at an average of 15.98, and his best figures came in a match against Lancashire, a feat appreciated by Yorkshire supporters as the fixture was always highly competitive.Thomson, p. 30. Then in the 1895 season, Hirst passed 100 wickets in the season for the first time, securing 150 wickets at an average of 17.06. He established himself as an opening bowler for Yorkshire, assuming the role from Ted Wainwright and developing a good partnership with Bobby Peel.Thomson, p. 22. Against Leicestershire, he took a hat-trick. Although primarily regarded as a bowler, and while Wisden later described his batting as being in \"temporary decline\" in 1895, Hirst also scored 710 runs at an average of 19.18, with three fifties."]}, {"page": "1893 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five All-Round Cricketers) \u2013 George Giffen, Alec Hearne, Stanley Jackson, Harry Trott, Ted Wainwright "]}, {"page": "1894 English cricket season", "response": ["|Ted Wainwright || Yorkshire || 15 || 2617 || 97 || 10.17"]}, {"page": "Edward Wainwright", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Wainwright"]}, {"page": "E Wainwright", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Wainwright"]}, {"page": "1897 English cricket season", "response": ["|Ted Wainwright || Yorkshire || 25 || 1372 || 39.20 || 5 || 4", "|Ted Wainwright || North of England, Players, Yorkshire || 32 || 1612 || 35.82 || 5 || 6"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Ted Wainwright \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Arthur Bannister", "response": ["Born in Somers Town, London, Bannister made his first-class debut on 7 May 1900 against Yorkshire.
