Green and Iranian-American mechanical engineer Paul M. Naghdi in the 1970s (see,Green, A. E. & Naghdi, P. M. (1974), \"On the theory of water waves\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The original equations, namely the Level I GN equations, are mostly applicable to the propagation of long waves in shallow waters. However, high level GN equations are also developed which are applicable to deep water waves. The equations differ from the classical water wave theories (e.g. Boussinesq equations) in that the flow need not be irrotational, and that no perturbation is used in deriving the equations. Hence, the GN equations satisfy the nonlinear boundary conditions exactly, and postulate the integrated conservation laws. Although the GN equations were developed very recently (compared to other wave theories), they are well-known and fairly understood by the research and scientific community."]}]}}
