She is best known for popularising Dante (1265\u20131321) and for her children's books. Many of her works are written under the pseudonym Norley Chester, which name appears to have been taken from the village of Norley, Cheshire, near the town of Chester. The use of pseudonyms was common with female writers of the time. She also illustrated the book The Pageant of The Year: A Garden Record In Verse.\nAccording to Chaucer as Children's Literature: Retellings from the Victorian and Edwardian Eras, Underdown's The Gateway to Chaucer \"...is probably the most thoughtful presentation to children...\" of the complicated work, and \"...one of the most thoughtful collections with great philosophical and historical interest.\"She is also remembered as a \"war poet\" of the First World War for her work \"The Gifts of War\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Underdown", "response": ["* Emily Underdown (1863-1947), English author"]}, {"page": "Henry Charles Innes Fripp", "response": ["Most of his best-known works are of fantasy or religious themes, including \"The Centaur at Play\", \"Madonna and Child\", and his series of illustrations for \"The Gateway to Romance\" by Emily Underdown, for which Innes Fripp did the illustrations in 1909 for publisher Thomas Nelson And Sons, and Lancelot and Guenevere by Gladys Davidson, illustrated by Fripp, published in 1912 by Dana Estes and Co."]}]}}
