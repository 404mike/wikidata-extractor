The Kaiser is slapped by one of his captains in anger, who then commits suicide to atone for his disgrace. Despite having signed a peace treaty with his neighbors, the Kaiser decides to declare war on Belgium. When Belgium is invaded by the German army during World War I, Marcas, a mighty-muscled blacksmith (Elmo Lincoln), although wounded, is able to save his daughter from the clutches of a German soldier, whom he kills and disposes of in a burning building. Soon after this, the RMS Lusitania is sunk by Captain von Neigle (Nigel De Brulier), and the Kaiser gives him a medal for his action, but the captain is later driven mad with remorse at the thought of the innocent women and children he killed. After the United States declares war, the Allied generals turn the Kaiser over to Albert I of Belgium.
