Entries in Philip Henslowe's Diary show that in the years around 1600 Henslowe paid as little as \u00a36 or \u00a37 per play. This was probably at the low end of the range, though even the best writers could not demand too much more. A playwright, working alone, could generally produce two plays a year at most. In the 1630s Richard Brome signed a contract with the Salisbury Court Theatre to supply three plays a year, but found himself unable to meet the workload. Shakespeare produced fewer than 40 solo plays in a career that spanned more than two decades: he was financially successful because he was an actor and, most importantly, a shareholder in the company for which he acted and in the theatres they used. Ben Jonson achieved success as a purveyor of Court masques, and was talented at playing the patronage game that was an important part of the social and economic life of the era. Those who were purely playwrights fared far less well: the biographies of early figures like George Peele and Robert Greene, and later ones like Brome and Philip Massinger, are marked by financial uncertainty, struggle, and poverty.", "Playwrights dealt with the natural limitation on their productivity by combining into teams of two, three, four, and even five to generate play texts. The majority of plays written in this era were collaborations, and the solo artists who generally eschewed collaborative efforts, like Jonson and Shakespeare, were the exceptions to the rule. Dividing the work, of course, meant dividing the income; but the arrangement seems to have functioned well enough to have made it worthwhile. Of the 70-plus known works in the canon of Thomas Dekker, roughly 50 are collaborations. In a single year (1598) Dekker worked on 16 collaborations for impresario Philip Henslowe, and earned \u00a330, or a little under 12 shillings per week\u2014roughly twice as much as the average artisan's income of 1s. per day. At the end of his career, Thomas Heywood would famously claim to have had \"an entire hand, or at least a main finger\" in the authorship of some 220 plays. A solo artist usually needed months to write a play (though Jonson is said to have done Volpone in five weeks); Henslowe's Diary indicates that a team of four or five writers could produce a play in as little as two weeks. Admittedly, though, the Diary also shows that teams of Henslowe's house dramatists\u2014Anthony Munday, Robert Wilson, Richard Hathwaye, Henry Chettle, and the others, even including a young John Webster\u2014could start a project, and accept advances on it, yet fail to produce anything stageworthy.", "*Philip Henslowe, entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "Thomas Kyd", "response": ["The Spanish Tragedie was probably written in the mid to late 1580s.

However, the play was usually known simply as \"Hieronimo\", after the protagonist. It was arguably the most popular play of the \"Age of Shakespeare\" and set new standards in effective plot construction and character development. In 1602 a version of the play with \"additions\" was published.

Henslowe refers to the play as \"ne\" (which most critics take to mean \"new\", although it could be an abbreviation for the Newington Butts theatre, which Henslow may have ownedSee Winifred Frazer, \"Henslowe's \"ne\"\", Notes and Queries, 38:1 (Spring, 1991), 34\u201335 and Brian Vickers, Shakespeare, Co-Author: A Historical Study of Five Collaborative Plays (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 149 for more information on this theory) and mentions that it had fifteen performances and earned \u00a33.16s.8d, meaning it was extremely successful. Harey Vj is usually accepted as being 1 Henry VI for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is unlikely to have been either 2 Henry VI or 3 Henry VI, as they were published in 1594 and 1595, respectively, with the titles under which they would have originally been performed, so as to ensure higher sales. As neither of them appear under the title Harey Vj, the play seen by Henslowe is unlikely to be either of them. Additionally, as Gary Taylor points out, Henslowe tended to identify sequels, but not first parts, to which he referred by the general title. As such, \"Harey Vj could not be a Part Two or Part Three but could easily be a Part One.\"Taylor (1995: 152) The only other option is that Harey Vj is a now lost play."]}, {"page": "1904 in literature", "response": ["*Philip Henslowe (died 1616), edited by Walter W.

Later that year he published a description of the event to prove to doubters that it was true.The year Kempe gives was 1599 Old Style, which has caused some later confusion. That Kempe's jig took place in 1600 (New Style) is established by a record of the payment of his prize money by the Norwich City Corporation. However, his activities after this famous stunt are as obscure as his origins. On evidence from The Travels of the Three English Brothers, he is assumed to have made another European tour, perhaps reaching Italy, but by 1601 he was borrowing money from Philip Henslowe and had joined Worcester's Men.

For a period of only five years, from 1597 to 1602, Drayton was a member of the stable of playwrights who supplied material for the theatrical syndicate of Philip Henslowe. Henslowe's Diary links Drayton's name with 23 plays from that period, and shows that Drayton almost always worked in collaboration with other Henslowe regulars, like Thomas Dekker, Anthony Munday, and Henry Chettle, among others.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; pp. 306\u20138. Of these 23 plays, only one has survived, that being Part 1 of Sir John Oldcastle, which Drayton composed in collaboration with Munday, Robert Wilson, and Richard Hathwaye. The text of Oldcastle shows no clear signs of Drayton's hand; traits of style consistent through the entire corpus of his poetry (the rich vocabulary of plant names, star names, and other unusual words; the frequent use of original contractional forms, sometimes with double apostrophes, like \"th'adult'rers\" or \"pois'ned'st\") are wholly absent from the text, suggesting that his contribution to the collaborative effort was not substantial.

If, then, it was a new play in March 1592, and if we also assume that it was a prequel written after the other two plays in the trilogy, the play was most likely written in 1591 or very early 1592.", ":First official record: Philip Henslowe's diary, 24 January 1594, where he records seeing the play \"titus & ondronicus\" at The Rose.", ":Evidence: obviously the play was written by November 1604, and conventionally, it tends to be dated 1603\u20131604. An important element in this dating is Shakespeare's use of sources. For example, \"burn like the mines of sulphur\" (3.3.331), \"one entire and perfect chrysolite\" (5.2.143), and \"Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees/Their medicinal gum (5.2.349\u2013350) are all thought to allude to Philemon Holland's translation of Pliny the Elder's Naturalus Historia, published in 1601. Additionally, Shakespeare probably took the information regarding the Turkish invasion of Cyprus (found in 1.3, 2.1 and 2.2) from Richard Knolles' General History of the Turks, which contains an epistle dated 30 September 1603. Specifically, he may have got the name Signor Angelo, mentioned in the sailor's report (1.3.16), from Angelus Sorianus, a Venetian commander discussed in Knolles. Also, the sailor's description of Turkish tactics, \"The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,/Steering with due course toward the island of Rhodes,/Have there injoined with an after fleet\" (1.3.34\u201336), may have come from Knolles' description of the Turkish fleets' actions prior to the siege of Nicosia. This suggests September 1603 as a likely terminus post quem. A possible terminus ante quem could be March 1604, when Philip Henslowe paid Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton for Part 1 of The Honest Whore, which contains the line \"more savage than a barbarous Moor.\" Whilst not specific enough to be a definite reference to Shakespeare, it is known that Othello was immensely popular from its very inception, and such a reference would certainly have made sense to an audience at the time. It has also been argued that the play may have been written with an eye to pleasing the new king, James I. James was interested in Turkish history, and had written a poem in 1591 about the Battle of Lepanto. The poem was republished upon his accession in 1603, and a play set amongst the events which ultimately led to that battle would have had a special interest for the king.  This would also support a date of 1603\u20131604. However, following H.C. Hart's 1928 edition of the play for the first series of the Arden Shakespeare, E.A.J. Honigmann dates the play mid-1601 to mid-1602, believing it to have influenced the bad quarto of Hamlet (in existence by July 1602). For example, he cites the substitution of the name \"Montano\" for \"Reynaldo.\" Montano occurs in no other play except Othello, and Honigmann believes the actor who worked on Hamlet Q1 played Reynaldo, but had played Montano in an earlier production of Othello, and unconsciously mixed up the names.  Additionally, MacDonald P. Jackson's pause analysis of the plays places Othello closest to Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, Twelfth Night and Measure for Measure, in that order. The \"average date\" for these four plays is 1602.  In his 2006 Oxford Shakespeare edition of the play, however, Michael Neill discusses Honigmann and Jackson's arguments, finding them suggestive, but not wholly persuasive, and ultimately settling for a \"compromise date\" of 1602\u20131603."]}, {"page": "George Chapman", "response": ["By the end of the 1590s, Chapman had become a successful playwright, working for Philip Henslowe and later for the Children of the Chapel. Among his comedies are The Blind Beggar of Alexandria (1596; printed 1598), An Humorous Day's Mirth (1597; printed 1599), All Fools (printed 1605), Monsieur D'Olive (1605; printed 1606), The Gentleman Usher (printed 1606), May Day (printed 1611), and The Widow's Tears (printed 1612). His plays show a willingness to experiment with dramatic form: An Humorous Day's Mirth was one of the first plays to be written in the style of \"humours comedy\" which Ben Jonson later used in Every Man in His Humour and Every Man Out of His Humour. With The Widow's Tears, he was also one of the first writers to meld comedy with more serious themes, creating the tragicomedy later made famous by Beaumont and Fletcher."]}]}}
