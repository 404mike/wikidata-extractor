A day later Romaine Sawyers of West Brom received racist abuse following a match, as did Reece James of Chelsea. On 30 January 2021, a 49-year old man from Kingswinford was arrested for racially abusing Sawyers. The same day, Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford received racist abuse on social media following a draw in a match. The increasing use of social media to racially abuse footballers was noted by Dan Roan of the BBC. In February 2021, Alex Jankewitz of Southampton suffered racist abuse on social media after the midfielder got sent off early in a game. Following a draw in February 2021, Tuanzebe received more racist abuse on social media after conceding a free-kick late in the game, which resulted in a last minute goal for the visitors. By February 2021, several clubs and players had decided against taking a knee before games, with Brentford feeling the gesture no longer had the required impact while Queens Park Rangers felt like it had become diluted. Similar reasons for stopping applied to Middlesbrough, with their player, Britt Assombalonga, calling for change after the initial success of taking a knee. Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace described the gesture as \"degrading\". He announced on 19 February 2021 that he would stop taking a knee before matches. Following Manchester United's draw against West Brom, Martial was again subjected to racist abuse on Instagram."]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.
