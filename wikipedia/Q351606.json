However, he still figured in Arsenal's 1950 FA Cup-winning side and after a successful run in the England B side, he was picked for England's squad for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. By now though, he was 33, and had not played for his country for two years; England's first choice right-back for the entire tournament was Alf Ramsey, and Scott did not play a single minute. In 1950\u201351 Scott played 17 matches for Arsenal, but with his injury often recurring, he was no longer automatic first-team choice, sharing the right-back position with Walley Barnes.

He regained his place the following season, and continued to be a near ever-present for Arsenal for the next five.

In the United Kingdom the match commentator was Kenneth Wolstenholme, former player Walley Barnes was also pitchside with a radio cameraman to capture the atmosphere before the game and also interview the players during the buildup. He was called upon only once during the match itself to comment on the injury to Chalmers. Many other countries broadcast either a full delayed match cast or edited highlights. The telecast was shown in its entirety in the United States by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on Wide World of Sports two weeks later on 20 May. The contest was the first overseas event to appear on the sports anthology series. The Chalmers storyline was played up to the point that \"Poor old Chalmers\" became a familiar phrase among fans of the television program."]}, {"page": "Freddie Cox", "response": ["Cox made his Arsenal debut straight away, on 7 September 1949 against West Bromwich Albion, and became an immediate regular in the side.

In the final, against Liverpool, he laid on a cross for Reg Lewis to score the only goal of the match, winning the Cup for Arsenal. Two years later, Arsenal again played Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals, and again Cox proved crucialhe scored Arsenal's goal in a 1\u20131 draw, and in the replay he scored twice and set up a third as Arsenal ran out 3\u20130 winners.
