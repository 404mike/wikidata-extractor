In 1925 Orpen painted Sunlight, a brilliant depiction, in dappled sunlight, of a nude woman on a bed, behind whom hangs The Seine at Marly, the 1874 painting by Monet which Orpen owned. In 1922, Orpen was reported to be receiving treatment in London for 'tobacco poisoning'. In 1923 Arthur Lee introduced Orpen to Edward, the Prince of Wales, and secured Orpen a commission to paint the Prince for the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. A long series of disagreements followed between the Prince's advisors, who wanted a formal portrait, and Orpen, who wanted to paint Edward in his golf clothes. Orpen got his way but it was not until 1928 that the R&A put the painting on display. In 1927, Orpen accepted a commission to paint a portrait of David Lloyd George but the completed work was rejected as being too informal for such a senior politician. The painting remained with Orpen and was only purchased by the National Portrait Gallery after his death. In 1928 Orpen stood for election as President of the Royal Academy but lost to Sir William Llewellyn. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics."]}, {"page": "Llywelyn", "response": ["*Sir William Llewellyn (1858\u20131941), English painter and President of the Royal Academy"]}, {"page": "Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)", "response": ["* 1933: Sir William Llewellyn GCVO PRA 'for his encouragement of Art in Industry'"]}, {"page": "1928 in Wales", "response": ["*Sir William Llewellyn is the first Welshman to become President of the Royal Academy of Arts."]}, {"page": "Past Three O'Clock", "response": ["Numerous variations of the carol include an arrangement by William Llewellyn as a \"quodlibet\" for choir: London Waits (Past Three O'clock).Novello and Co Ltd."]}, {"page": "Harcourt Clare", "response": ["In 1916, Sir Harcourt was knighted.
