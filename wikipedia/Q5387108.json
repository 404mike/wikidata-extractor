He was capped twelve times for Scotland between 1910 and 1914, his first appearance coming as a surprise replacement for the Scottish captain, George Cunningham. He was selected for the 1910 British Isles tour to South Africa after other players were forced to withdraw. Due to illness, he only participated in three matches, and did not take part in any of the tests against South Africa. In 1914, he captained Scotland against Ireland, and against England in the last international match before the outbreak of the First World War.\nAt the start of the war, Milroy was commissioned in the Black Watch and was killed in action in Delville Wood, France, during the Battle of the Somme. He was one of 31 Scottish rugby internationals to be killed in action. Milroy is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial to the missing dead of the Somme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thiepval Memorial", "response": ["* Scots rugby international Eric Milroy"]}, {"page": "Watsonian FC", "response": ["* Eric Milroy, 12 caps."]}, {"page": "1912\u201313 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe", "response": [";Scotland: Walter Dickson, Walter Sutherland, Alex Angus, AW Gunn, James Pearson, James Boyd, Eric Milroy, Patrick Blair, Lewis Robertson, WDCL Purves, David Howie, David Bain, JMB Scott, J Dobson, FH Turner capt."]}, {"page": "1910 British Lions tour to South Africa", "response": ["|Eric Milroy"]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union players killed in World War I", "response": ["* : David Bedell-Sivright, Eric Milroy", "* Eric Milroy, (\"Puss Milroy\") died on 18 July 1916 Aged 28.", "Adam Burdett was part of the 1906-7 tour to the British Isles.

Poignantly, in the two games he played on that tour in November 1906, he shared the field with  David Bedell-Sivright of , and Basil Maclear of , who were also casualties of that war. Likewise, Toby Moll would probably have rubbed shoulders with Eric Milroy, Noel Humphreys or Phil Waller in the 1910 British Isles tour of South Africa."]}]}}
