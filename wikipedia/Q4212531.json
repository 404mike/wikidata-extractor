Cunningham published several topographical and biographical studies, of which the most important are his Handbook of London (1849) and The Life of Drummond of Hawthornden (1833). He edited Extracts from the Accounts of the Revels at Court in the Reigns of Elizabeth and James I (1842) and Horace Walpole's Letters (1857).\nIn 1851 he appeared in an amateur production of a play Not So Bad As We Seem by Edward Bulwer-Lytton along with Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Mark Lemon, John Tenniel, Douglas Jerrold and others.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Horace Walpole", "response": ["After Walpole's death, Lady Louisa Stuart, in the introduction to the letters of her grandmother, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1837), wrote of rumours that Horace's biological father was not Sir Robert Walpole but Carr, Lord Hervey (1691\u20131723), elder half-brother of the more famous John Hervey. T. H. White writes: \"Catherine Shorter, Sir Robert Walpole's first wife, had five children. Four of them were born in a sequence after the marriage; the fifth, Horace, was born eleven years later, at a time when she was known to be on bad terms with Sir Robert, and known to be on romantic terms with Carr, Lord Hervey.\" The lack of physical resemblance between Horace and Sir Robert, and his close resemblance to members of the Hervey family, encouraged these rumours.

Turner", "response": ["As an academy probationer, Turner was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures. From July 1790 to October 1793, his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times. In June 1792, he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models. Turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout Britain, particularly to Wales, where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours. These particularly focused on architectural work, which used his skills as a draughtsman. In 1793, he showed the watercolour titled The Rising Squall\u00a0\u2013 Hot Wells from St Vincent's Rock Bristol (now lost), which foreshadowed his later climatic effects. The British writer Peter Cunningham, in his obituary of Turner, wrote that it was: \"recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipidities...[and] evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated\"."]}, {"page": "Peter Cunningham", "response": ["Peter Cunningham may refer to:", "*Peter Cunningham (footballer) (1906\u20131934), Scottish soccer player", "*Peter Cunningham (photographer), American photographer", "*Peter Cunningham (priest) (c.1747\u20131805), English cleric and poet", "*Peter Cunningham (racing driver) (born 1962), American race car driver", "*Peter Cunningham (British writer) (born 1816), British writer", "*Peter Cunningham (Irish writer) (born 1947), Irish writer"]}, {"page": "Morley's Hotel", "response": ["Morley's Hotel opened in 1832.
