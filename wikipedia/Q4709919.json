A forward, he scored 88 goals in 345 leagues games over a sixteen-year professional career in the Football League.\nTurning professional with Burnley in 1951, he spent the next eight years at the club, making 158 appearances in league and cup competitions. Signing with Leicester City in 1959, he went on to play for the \"Foxes\" in the 1961 FA Cup Final. He moved on to Port Vale in 1963, and after recovering from injury he became the club's top-scorer in 1964\u201365, before he transferred to Mansfield Town in 1965. He spent two years with Mansfield before he was forced to retire due to injury.
