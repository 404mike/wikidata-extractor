A shoulder injury kept Jelley out of action for four months and limited him to only three starts in Tigers 1997\u201398, however the following campaign was his best with a club-leading 35 appearances in the 1998\u201399 season, including 20 starts, as Leicester won the Premiership that season.  Jelley's appearances became more limited as Freshwater was preferred as reserve loosehead and Ricky Nebbett was signed to cover tighthead.  His final Leicester appearance was on 23 January 2003 at Welford Road in the Heineken Cup against Neath."]}]}}
