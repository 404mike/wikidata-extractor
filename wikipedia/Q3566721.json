As Commander in Chief, Phillip was in command of both the naval and marine forces, his naval officers readily obeyed his commands, but as he sought a measure of co-operation from the marine officers that ran against their tradition. Major Robert Ross and his officers (with the exception of a few such as David Collins, Watkin Tench and William Dawes) refused to do anything other than guard duty, claiming that they were neither gaolers, supervisors nor policemen.", "Even though there was now friendly relations with the aborigines around Sydney Cove, the same couldn\u2019t be said about the ones around Botany Bay, whom had killed or wounded 17 colonists.

The region's indigenous population was also suffering. It is estimated that half of the native people in Sydney died during the smallpox epidemic of 1789.

Phillip and several of his officers \u2013 most notably Watkin Tench \u2013 left behind journals and accounts which tell of immense hardships during the first years of settlement. Part of Macquarie's effort to transform the colony was his authorisation for convicts to re-enter society as free citizens. Roads, bridges, wharves, and public buildings were constructed using convict labour and by 1822 the town had banks, markets, and well-established thoroughfares. Parramatta Road was opened in 1811, which is one of Sydney's oldest roads and Australia's first highway between two cities \u2013 Sydney (present day city centre) and Parramatta.", "Many writers have originated in and set their work in Sydney. Others have visited the city and commented on it. Some of them are commemorated in the Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay. The city was the headquarters for Australia's first published newspaper, the Sydney Gazette. Watkin Tench's A Narrative of the Expedition to Botany Bay (1789) and A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson in New South Wales (1793) have remained the best-known accounts of life in early Sydney. Since the infancy of the establishment, much of the literature set in Sydney were concerned with life in the city's slums and working-class communities, notably William Lane's The Working Man's Paradise (1892), Christina Stead's Seven Poor Men of Sydney (1934) and Ruth Park's The Harp in the South (1948). The first Australian-born female novelist, Louisa Atkinson, set various of her novels in Sydney.Maguire, M., 'Atkinson, (Caroline) Louisa Waring', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens, South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 35. Contemporary writers, such as Elizabeth Harrower, were born in the city and thus set most of the work there\u2013Harrower's debut novel Down in the City (1957) was mostly set in a King's Cross apartment. Well known contemporary novels set in the city include Melina Marchetta's Looking for Alibrandi (1992), Peter Carey's 30 Days in Sydney: A Wildly Distorted Account (1999), J.M.
