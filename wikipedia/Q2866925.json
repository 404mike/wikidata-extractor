His findings resulted in the length of operator duty shifts being severely reduced.In 1951, Mackworth became head of the Unit for Research in Applied Psychology at Cambridge University, where he remained until emigrating to Canada in 1958.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit", "response": ["* Norman Mackworth, 1951\u20131958"]}, {"page": "N.H.

It was originally created by Norman Mackworth as an experimental simulation of long term monitoring by radar operators in the British Air Force during World War II.Mackworth, N. H. (1948). The breakdown of vigilance during prolonged visual search. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, vol. 1, pp.6-21 The device has a large black pointer in a large circular background like a clock. The pointer moves in short jumps like the second hand of an analog clock, approximately every second. At infrequent and irregular intervals, the hand makes a double jump, e.g. 12 times every 30 seconds. The task is to detect when the double jumps occur by pressing a button. Typically, Mackworth's participants would do this task for two hours.Shackel, B. (1999). How I broke the Mackworth clock test (and what I learned). In Hanson, M., Lovesey, E. J., and Robertson, S. A. Contemporary Ergonomics 1999. Taylor & Francis. (pp. 193-197) The Mackworth Clock was used to establish one of the fundamental findings in the vigilance and sustained attention literature: the vigilance decrement (signal detection accuracy) decreases notably after 30 minutes on task. The test continues to be used today in vigilance research in various forms, including computer-displayed versions.Lichstein, K. L., Riedel, B. W., & Richman, S. L. (2000).

Mackworth authored \"The breakdown of vigilance during prolonged visual search\" in 1948 and this paper is the seminal publication on vigilance.Mackworth, N.H. (1948). The breakdown of vigilance during prolonged visual search, Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 1, 6-21. Mackworth's 1948 study investigated the tendency of radar and sonar operators to miss rare irregular event detections near the end of their watch. Mackworth simulated rare irregular events on a radar display by having the test participants watch an unmarked clock face over a 2-hour period. A single clock hand moved in small equal increments around the clock face, with the exception of occasional larger jumps. This device became known as the Mackworth Clock. Participants were tasked to report when they detected the larger jumps. Mackworth's results indicated a decline in signal detection over time, known as a vigilance decrement. The participants' event detection declined between 10 and 15 percent in the first 30 minutes and then continued to decline more gradually for the remaining 90 minutes. Mackworth's method became known as the \"Clock Test\" and this method has been employed in subsequent investigations."]}, {"page": "Norman H. Mackworth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Norman Mackworth"]}]}}
