She was the daughter of George Thomson, merchant, by his wife Peggy Cook, an actress, whose aunt, Sarah West, enjoyed a high position on the stage. At an early age, she accompanied her parents to Australia, and at eight, as a child singer and dancer, earned a reputation as a prodigy. In 1845, she was playing at the Victoria Theatre, Melbourne. In June 1846, at Trinity Church, Launceston, Tasmania, she was married to Charles Frederick Young, a comedian. She supported G. V.

She took on parts such as Julia in The Hunchback (Knowles), Lady Teazle, and Lady Townley in The Provoked Husband (John Vanburgh and Colley Cibber) for which her years began to disqualify her. She revived in November The Scornful Lady, adapted by Serle, playing in it the Lady; and in 1848 Lucille and The Double Marriage, the latter again in Serle's adaptation.  In 1847 Martha Cranmer Oliver made her London d\u00e9but at the Theatre Royal,Obituary, The Era, 1 January 1881, p. 8 which was the same year the actress Sarah West made her last appearance at the theatre before retiring. However, Mary Warner's period of management at the Marylebone Theatre was not a success and she was succeeded by others such as E. T. Smith (1850-1852) and J. W. Wallack (1853-1857) in joint management with William Shaftoe Robertson, the father of Madge Kendal, who similarly failed to make the Marylebone a success. "]}]}}
