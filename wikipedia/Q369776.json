The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for nude women. The leading British genre painter, Sir David Wilkie was 55 when he travelled to Istanbul and Jerusalem in 1840, dying off Gibraltar during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a Protestant agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: \"a Martin Luther in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered\", by which he meant traditional Christian iconography. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the Pre-Raphaelite William Holman Hunt and David Roberts (in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia) had similar motivations,Tromans, 14 (quoted), 162\u2013165 giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start.Nochlin, 289, disputing Rosenthal assertion, and insisting that \"there must be some attempt to clarify whose reality we are talking about\". The French artist James Tissot also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.", "Other artists concentrated on landscape painting, often of desert scenes, including Richard Dadd and Edward Lear.

The newest development in these popular entertainments was the \"moving diorama\" or \"moving panorama.\" These consisted of huge paintings that unfolded upon rollers like giant scrolls; they were supplemented with sound and lighting effects to create a nineteenth-century anticipation of cinema. Stanfield and Roberts produced eight of these entertainments; in light of their later accomplishments as marine painters, their panoramas of two important naval engagements, the Bombardment of Algiers and The Battle of Navarino, are worth noting."]}, {"page": "Saint Catherine's Monastery", "response": ["File:David Roberts - Convent of St. Catherine with Mount Horeb - 1927.90 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|David Roberts, 1839, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia"]}, {"page": "Colossi of Memnon", "response": ["With the exception of the Colossi, however, very little remains today of Amenhotep's temple.
