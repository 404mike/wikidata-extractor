Once he left school, at age 14, he started working in Rylands. His first professional club was Manchester City, who he joined from amateur side Greenwood Victoria in August 1949. He did not make his league debut until more than three years later, playing against Liverpool at Anfield in January 1953. He made five further appearances that season, but the following season he displaced Jack Hannaway to become first choice full-back. Under the Revie Plan, Little formed a defensive partnership with Jimmy Meadows, as Manchester City reached consecutive FA Cup finals.\nIn the 1955 FA Cup final, against Newcastle United, Little's despairing lunge was unable to prevent Jackie Milburn from scoring the opening goal after less than a minute. Midway through the first half Little's defensive partner Meadows was lost to injury, and though Manchester City equalised, the final score was a comfortable 3\u20131 win for Newcastle. Though defeated in the 1955 final, Manchester City had another strong season in 1955\u201356. Little was ever-present as City finished fourth in the league and again reached the FA Cup final, in which they faced Birmingham City. This time Manchester City scored an early goal, and by the middle of the second half gained a 3\u20131 lead. A serious injury to Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann meant City captain Roy Paul considered putting Little in goal. However, Trautmann insisted upon carrying on, and City held out for the victory, giving Little the first and only major honour of his career. Three days later X-rays found that Trautmann had broken his neck.Little remained a first team regular for two further seasons, but lost his place to Cliff Sear in 1958, and was transferred to Brighton & Hove Albion for \u00a34,850 on 18 October, having played a total of 187 matches for City, scoring two goals. He later played for Crystal Palace, who had just gained promotion to the Third Division. He was one of four players to make their Palace debut on the opening day of the 1961\u201362 season. After 38 appearances for the Glaziers, Little ended his football career with a spell as player-manager of Dover.\nAfter retiring from professional football Little returned to Manchester, and took a job at a University of Manchester sports centre in Wythenshawe, where he worked for over 25 years until retirement. A university football competition is named in his honour. The current holders are German Society FC who overturned a two-goal deficit against a much fancied Medics outfit to win 3\u20132.\nLittle died on 29 January 2015 in Manchester. He was 83. His obituary was placed in the Manchester Evening News on 2 February 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roy Clarke (footballer)", "response": ["He later managed Northwich Victoria for a brief period, before returning to Manchester, where he opened a sports shop in Fallowfield. Through his friendship with Bert Trautmann he gained a contract to become the first Adidas merchant in the area,Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p190 but the shop closed a few years later as Clarke wished to concentrate upon activities at Manchester City. Clarke became the manager of the Manchester City social club in 1966; he and his wife Kathleen ran the social club together for nearly 25 years. The social club was open seven days a week, providing an opportunity for players, management and supporters to form closer bonds. It received praise in Arthur Hopcraft's 1968 book The Football Man, for providing a counterpoint to football clubs who \"largely ignored [their fans] except when they were inside the ground\". During his time at the social club Clarke was a founder of two other Manchester City organisations: the Development Association, which acts as a fund for ground improvements and youth development, and the Former Players' Association, which was co-founded with Paddy Fagan and Roy Little, Clarke serving as secretary. In 2004, he was inducted into the Manchester City Hall of Fame, receiving a lifetime achievement award. Towards the end of his life he suffered from Alzheimer's disease, and died on 13 March 2006, leaving a wife and three daughters."]}, {"page": "Roy Paul", "response": ["The following season the club surpassed the achievements of the previous season, finishing fourth in the league and again reaching the FA Cup final, this time facing Birmingham City.

Then German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann badly hurt his neck in a collision with Peter Murphy. Paul instructed Roy Little to take Trautmann's place, but Trautmann insisted that he would keep playing. Then Manchester City held on for the victory, and Paul collected the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II. X-rays later revealed that Trautmann had played on with a broken neck. Paul took the match ball from the final as a souvenir, and gave it to his son.Maddox, Saffer and Robinson, Manchester City Cup Kings 1956, p. 59."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Roy Little||  || Full back || 1949\u20131958||187||2|| ||"]}, {"page": "1956 FA Cup Final", "response": ["With 17\u00a0minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing.
