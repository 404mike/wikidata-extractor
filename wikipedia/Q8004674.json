The play was performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with a cast including Edward Woodward as Owen Tudor and Frank Finlay as the Gaoler. The Queen and the Welshman transferred to the Lyric, Hammersmith, in 1957 and was well received. William Aubrey Darlington, drama critic of The Daily Telegraph, praised Sisson's \"keen nose for stories that are both true to actuality and to stage affect.\" The play was broadcast several times, including a television production in 1958. When John Wiles adapted The Queen and the Welshman for this version, Sisson sat next to him and asked questions about the art of writing television screenplays. The play was also adapted as a Theatre 625 production in 1966. This was thought to have been lost, but it was found in 2010 to have been deposited with the Library of Congress.
