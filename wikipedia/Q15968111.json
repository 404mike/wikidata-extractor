The ALRA's turning point was to gain the support of the liberal politician David Steel. He was a liberal M.P. who had been lucky enough to win a third chance of placing a private members bill through the house of commons. He was able to choose which law to introduce. He rejected a call to amend the rights of plumbers and homosexuals and decided to reform the laws of abortion. He cites Alice Jenkin's argument in her book \"Law For The Rich\" as being pivotal in his decision. Steele put forward a private members bill that was backed by the government and it resulted in the 1967 Abortion Act."]}, {"page": "Haberdashers' School for Girls", "response": ["*Vera Houghton CBE, campaigner (1914\u20132013) (Class of 1931)"]}, {"page": "Douglas Houghton, Baron Houghton of Sowerby", "response": ["In 1939, he married Vera Houghton who also worked at Association of Officers for Taxes, before becoming a campaigner for abortion law reform and free birth control."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Vera Houghton, 99, health campaigner."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2013", "response": ["*Vera Houghton, 99, British health campaigner.Vera Houghton obituary"]}, {"page": "May Farquharson", "response": ["In 1939, Farquharson helped found the Birth Control League of Jamaica, which would later become the Family Planning League of Jamaica (FPLJ). At the same time, she founded in Kingston the Mother\u2019s Welfare Clinic. The goal of these organizations was to promote birth control among the populace as a means to improve their social condition, provide care and education about health needs to mothers and children, and to enlist government backing of the program. To that end, Farquharson kept a wide correspondence with other reformers, such as Vera Houghton, Edith How-Martyn, and Margaret Sanger, as well as birth control suppliers, such as Holland\u2013Rantos. Reformers, such as Farquharson, saw their clients in Jamaica as a special population, which needed unique contraception methods and education techniques. Much of this attitude came out of the Eugenics movement of the 1930s, which saw the Afro-Jamaican poor as a culturally different and backward segment of society. Though in some ways, the efforts of the FPLJ were opposed by the Catholic Church of Jamaica, clergy and birth control advocates were in agreement that illegitimacy and co-habitation without marriage were social ills. Farquharson and the FPLJ, believed that limiting birth rates would not only reduce immorality, but also would diminish demand on the over-burdened and under-funded health services."]}]}}
