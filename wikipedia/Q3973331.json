They are still touring and draw in large crowds from around the world.", "After reading an NME review of the Sex Pistols' first performance, Shelley and Devoto travelled to London together to see the Sex Pistols in February 1976. Shelley and Devoto were impressed by what they saw and arranged for the Sex Pistols to come and perform at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester, in June 1976. Buzzcocks intended to play at this concert, but the other musicians dropped out, and Shelley and Devoto were unable to recruit replacements in time for the gig. Once they had recruited bass guitarist Steve Diggle and drummer John Maher, they made their debut opening for the Sex Pistols' second Manchester concert in July 1976. A brief clip of Devoto-era Buzzcocks performing The Troggs' \"I Can't Control Myself\" appears in the Punk: Attitude documentary directed by Don Letts. In September 1976 the band travelled to London to perform at the two-day 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Malcolm McLaren. Other performers included: the Sex Pistols, Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Clash, The Vibrators, The Damned and the French band Stinky Toys.", "After a few months, Devoto left the group, expressing his dissatisfaction at the direction that punk was taking in his statement \"what was once unhealthily fresh is now a clean old hat\". He returned to college for a year, then formed Magazine. Pete Shelley took on the vocal duties; his high-pitched, melodic singing stood in stark contrast to the gruff pub rock vocal stylings of many punk contemporaries. Steve Diggle switched from bass to guitar, and Garth Davies (a.k.a. Garth Smith) rejoined on bass. While Davies appeared on the band's first Radio 1 Peel Session, in September 1977, his alleged unreliability led to his expulsion from the band. (He later joined New York band Dirty Looks.) Davies was replaced by Steve Garvey.

The band recorded their first album in 14 years, Trade Test Transmissions (1993), a return to the band's original pop punk sound and a departure from the experimental music Shelly and Diggle had recorded away from the Buzzcocks. Although it was a critical success, it was not a commercial one despite the huge surge in popularity for pop punk at the same time, but regardless, the band toured relentlessly worldwide following its release.", "On All Set, the band's drummer Phil Barker was noted as \"in particular showing more individual flashes and flair than before,\" whilst Shelley and Diggle \"throw in a couple of almost mainstream guitar solos along the way, but otherwise are as dedicated as always to the virtues of high-volume, brisk poppiness.\" Some songs on All Set seem to borrow whole guitar licks from older songs by the band, such as the European siren lick from \"Harmony in My Head\" that resurfaces on \"Point of No Return\", but, in the words of Roger Catlin, \"these aren't middle-age musicians trying to pass for callow youth,\" as some of the songs on the album \"reflect their maturity and approach to relationships that the early singles just couldn't.\" The sound of the band changes considerably in songs written by Steve Diggle, who according to Catlin \"sounds a bit like Pete Townshend when he doesn't sound like Peter Frampton.

So, its easier when you start writing songs. You haven't got any songs that you know you are trying to write like that. So, you don't have that subconscious fear of coming up with the same song twice.
