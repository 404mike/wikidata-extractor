Five minutes later he took another shot that deflected off John Potter and fell kindly for Lauri Dalla Valle, who was left with a simple finish to make it 2\u20130. Dunfermline's task was made much harder when Gary Mason was sent off for a seemingly innocuous tackle on Johnny Russell.

Jim McIntyre immediately stated he would appeal the decision.</ After the red card Dunfermline rallied and managed to put the visitors under pressure and after the ball bounced nicely off Paddy Boyle, Andy Kirk was on hand to score. Dunfermline pushed for a second, but left spaces in the defence and when Russell scored a third for United, it seemed game over. Dunfermline continued their pressure and when Pat Clarke went to play the ball past Jon Daly, only for the defender to handle the ball, a red card was expected as Clarke would have been clean through on goal.
