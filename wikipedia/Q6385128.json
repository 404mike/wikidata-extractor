Some have blamed the return to 25-minute episodes, coming after Thunderbirds 50-minute format, for a lack of subplots and perceived drop in the quality of the storytelling.

In the United States it was shown on the premium cable TV channel Showtime and, later, on PBS. The show starred Michael Praed and Jason Connery as two different incarnations of the title character.

While he found that some elements of the story were enjoyable, he felt that it lacked emotional continuity and the Daleks did not impress. DVD Talk's John Sinnott found the story more enjoyable than Frontier in Space, praising the way Nation \"filled the plot with creative other-worldly creatures and devices and used them nicely to move the story\".

In 2009, Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was positive towards the detailed scripts and the various villains, especially the War Chief. The A.V. Club reviewer praised the way the serial subverted viewers' expectations of a typical historical story. He noted that there was padding to fill the running time, but felt that it was done well and that it worked better than in The Dalek Invasion of Earth. He also wrote positively of Madoc's War Lord and Jamie and Zoe's departure, and said that the story purposefully \"doesn't resolve neatly or satisfyingly\". Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised Troughton's performance and the way that it was structured to \"constantly [expand] the story's scope\", though he admitted there was still padding.

Howe and Walker also praised Letts' direction, though they found that the over-use of CSO caused some scenes to \"look false and strained\". In 2009, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times compared the serial to a comic strip and wrote positively about Manning and Delgado. However, he noted that there were \"plot holes\" and \"gaudy early '70s production values\". Ian Berriman of SFX, reviewing the serial for its 2011 DVD release, also commented that Delgado was \"note-perfect from the off\" and that while the climax was \"feeble\", he felt \"it's all such outrageous fun that it doesn't really matter\". DVD Talk reviewer John Sinnott described Terror of the Autons as \"a wonderful romp,\" although \"the ending is rushed and pretty much just pulled out of nowhere\".
