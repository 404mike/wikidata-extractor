The Scottish writer Alan Warner has written two novels in tribute to two different Can members (Morvern Callar to Holger Czukay and The Man Who Walks to Michael Karoli respectively). The Sacrilege remix album features remixes of Can tracks by artists who were influenced by Can, including Sonic Youth and U.N.K.L.E.. Their ethnomusicological tendencies pre-date the craze for world music in the 1980s. While not nearly as influential on electronic music as Kraftwerk, they were important early pioneers of ambient music, along with Tangerine Dream and the aforementioned band. Many groups working in the post-rock genre can look to Can as an influence as part of the larger krautrock scene, as can New Prog bands such as The Mars Volta. Rolling Stone called the group a \"pioneering space rock band\". Kanye West has sampled \"Sing Swan Song\" on his song \"Drunk & Hot Girls\" from his 2007 album Graduation. The UK band Loop was deeply influenced by Can for their repetitive polyrhythmic style, covering Can's \"Mother Sky\" on their Fade Out album. The Yugoslav progressive/psychedelic rock band Igra Staklenih Perli, heavily influenced by Can, on their self-titled debut album released the song \"Pe\u010durka\" (\"Mushroom\") as a tribute to Can."]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Mr Egg (born 1959), formerly known as James McDonald, singer/songwriter, Egebamyasi, progenitor of acid house music"]}, {"page": "Egebamyasi (band)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mr Egg"]}, {"page": "Egebamyasi", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mr Egg"]}, {"page": "Mr. Egg", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mr Egg"]}, {"page": "Mr. Egg (musician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mr Egg"]}]}}
