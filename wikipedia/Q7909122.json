However, after 18 months of Miller's touring in secondary theatres, he was invited back to the \"number ones\", the Moss Empires and returned in triumph to the London Palladium. This revitalised his career and with it came a new recording contract, this time with Philips. He was back on radio and appeared on television, but his television appearances were never a great success.
