By the 11th century Friskney, Wolmersty and Wrangle were established on the raised ground, while Wainfleet had formed on a roddon by the north-eastern end. The Tofts acted as a sea defence;Simmons (2015), p. 16. the former path running along the length of the Tofts (variously called High Street, Highgate and Saltersgate) is described as a sea-dyke by H. E. Hallam.Hallam (1965), p. 76. Salt-making took place in the proximity during the Middle Ages; between Leake and Wainfleet, there were 56 salterns mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 and there are many subsequent documentary references to salt-production among the medieval inhabitants.Simmons (2015), pp. 11\u201320.Some discussion of the medieval industry is also in Hallam (1965), pp. 76\u201377. The long strips of land occupied by salters (tofts) provide the name for the feature. The process of producing salt from salt marsh also gradually led to the accretion of wastes in the havens at Wrangle, Wainfleet and Friskney, as well as along the estuaries at the havens and along the Tofts's seaward side.Simmons (2017), p. 44. The geographer Ian Simmons has argued that this process and the presence of salterns along much of the coast led to the \"seawards movement\" of a coastline composed of salterns. The top 2\u20133m of the Tofts, which are composed of silt and sands, are probably human deposits and the remnants waste from these salt-making activities."]}]}}
