She was best known for creating the character Adrian Mole.\nAfter writing in secret from the age of 14, Townsend first became known for her plays, her signature character first appearing in a radio drama, but her work soon expanded into other forms. She enjoyed great success in the 1980s, with her Adrian Mole books selling more copies than any other work of fiction in Britain during the decade. This series, which eventually encompassed nine books, takes the form of the character's diaries. The earliest books recount the life of a teenage boy during the Thatcher years, but the sequence eventually depicts Adrian Mole in middle age.\nThe Queen and I (1992), another popular work which was well received, was an outlet for her republican sentiments, although the Royal Family is still rendered with sympathy. Both the earliest Adrian Mole book and The Queen and I were adapted for the stage and enjoyed successful runs in London's West End.\nTownsend was poor until well into her thirties, and used her experiences of hardship in her work. In her later years she suffered ill health, in part related to the diabetes she developed in the mid-1980s, and in her last years endured serious sight and mobility problems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 2", "response": ["*  1946   \u2013 Sue Townsend, English author and playwright (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "April 10", "response": ["*  2014   \u2013 Sue Townsend, English author and playwright (b. 1946)"]}, {"page": "Epistolary novel", "response": ["* The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13\u00be (1982) by Sue Townsend is a comic novel in the form of a diary set in 1980s Britain."]}, {"page": "John Major", "response": ["Private Eye parodied Sue Townsend's The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, age 13\u00be to run a regular column The Secret Diary of John Major, age 47\u00be, in which Major was portrayed as na\u00efve and childish, keeping lists of his enemies in a Rymans Notebook called his \"Bastards Book\", and featuring \"my wife Norman\" and \"Mr Dr Mawhinney\" as recurring characters.

An early example is Anita Loos's novel of 1925: Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady in which the protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that \"follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech\" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, \"burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class\".  The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978\u201381 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of \"Simon Crisp\", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, The Diary of a Somebody, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in The Spectator, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is \"affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not\". In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend's teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter. "]}, {"page": "University of Leicester", "response": ["* The Sue Townsend Collection.
