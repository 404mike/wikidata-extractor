He played the role of Finn Sharkey in Waterloo Road, and has appeared in series such as Brookside and Grange Hill.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brookside (TV series)", "response": ["In 2003, and now with a much reduced cast, storylines focused strongly on Brookside's most popular remaining characters in more self-contained episodes, such as Bev's troubled relationship with her young son Josh (Jack McMullen) and the developing relationship between Jimmy Corkhill and Nikki Shadwick. Nikki had been raped, stalked, held hostage, and her father, brother and sister had all been killed during her time in Brookside Close. With her mother, Margi, now living abroad, she became increasingly dependent on Jimmy and started to see him as a father figure, even agreeing to look after Jimmy so that he could be released from secure psychiatric care. Following the siege, however, she had a brief relationship with the sniper who had rescued her, Matt Henderson (Jamie Lomas), but when that storyline was quickly abandoned during the jarring transition to the 90-minute block format, Nikki began to become romantically interested in Jimmy. After pursuing him for some time, viewers cringed when the two slept together, but knowing a relationship would be impossible, the two resolved to move on. On the rebound, Nikki became involved with Sean Smith (Barry Sloane), Ruth Gordon's ex-husband from across the Close, while Jimmy became engaged to Nikki's returned mother Margi (Bernadette Foley). Ultimately though, Jimmy called off the wedding when he suspected he may have lung cancer (although it later transpired to be asbestosis), so Margi jumped on the first plane back to Brussels leaving Nikki all alone at number 6 once again until long running characters Sammy and Katie Rogers eventually moved back to the Close as Nikki's lodgers.", "Further low-key storylines in the final year of Brookside included following Mike (Paul Byatt) and Rachel Dixon's (Tiffany Chapman) continuous problems with debt before they finally settled down away from the Close with their daughter Beth. Long serving character Katie Rogers (Diane Burke) found love with Nic Howard (James Sarsfield) and gave birth to their baby girl, although it was left up to the viewer to decide whether Katie and Nic were eventually married when they left the Close for Florida in the closing episodes. Anthony Murray's harrowing bullying storyline was happily resolved and his parents, Marty (Neil Caple) and recently returned real mum Jan (Helen Sheals), eventually reconciled and remarried. Bev and Ron Dixon also got back together, finally forgiving all the problems of their chequered pasts, they gave their relationship another chance and got married, with young Josh (Jack McMullen) completing their happy family. Some viewers were surprised to discover, however, that long-running characters Max and Jacqui Farnham had left Brookside off-screen, with Ron making a scripted, off-hand remark about their departure to a new life in Woolton."]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Jack McMullen: Actor."]}, {"page": "List of Brookside characters", "response": ["|Josh Dixon || Jack McMullen ||1993\u20131996, 1998\u20132003"]}, {"page": "The British Soap Awards", "response": ["| \"Best Newcomer\" || Jack McMullen (Josh McLoughlin in Brookside)", "| \"Best On-Screen Partnership\" || Jack McMullen & Sarah White (Josh & Bev McLoughlin in Brookside)"]}, {"page": "List of Waterloo Road characters", "response": ["*Finn Sharkey (Jack McMullen, series 5\u22127)"]}, {"page": "List of Grange Hill characters", "response": ["| Jack McMullen "]}, {"page": "List of British former child actors", "response": ["*Jack McMullen (born 1991)"]}, {"page": "John McMullen", "response": ["*Jack McMullen (born 1991), actor"]}]}}
