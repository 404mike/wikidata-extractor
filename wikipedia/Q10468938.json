He played for St Mirren before joining Blackburn Rovers in 1904. He spent three years at the club before signing for First Division rivals Chelsea. After they were relegated, he helped Chelsea to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1911\u201312. He signed with non-league Port Vale in 1913, departing the following year, only to return in 1916.

A tragic figure owing to his premature death when probably the best wicket-keeper in the world, Cameron is often forgotten today but regarded by those who know about him as one of the best wicket-keepers in the history of cricket.

He was succeeded by Tommy Clare, though it was Sam Bennion at the helm when the club left the Second Division and folded at the end of the 1906\u201307 season. Port Vale reformed in the obscurity of the North Staffordshire Federation League and it was Harry Myatt who was next recorded as first-team manager in October 1913. He was soon followed by Tom Holford and Jock Cameron. Vale's first major success was with Tom Morgan, who managed the club to the Third Division North title in the 1929\u201330 season, though he had simply carried on the work of Joe Schofield, who died on 29 September 1929 after over nine years in the post. Morgan was replaced by former manager Tom Holford in June 1932, who led the club to a record high finish of eighth in the Second Division in 1933\u201334. He was however sacked in September 1935 and not replaced, as the club reverted to selection by committee. Following relegation, the club appointed former England full-back Warney Cresswell as manager-coach in May 1936. He lasted just one season and Tom Morgan was reinstated in December 1937, who tendered his resignation shortly before World War II in April 1939."]}]}}
