Ceres signed a number of national team members such as Patrick Reichelt, Carlie De Murga and brothers Marwin and Marvin Angeles to boost its campaign. As fate would have it, Ceres and Global met again in the finals to battle for the first and only UFL FA League Cup trophy. During the finals, Ceres came out firing right at the opening whistle, with Kim Jin Ho scoring at the first minute after converting a header for an early 1-nil lead. Ceres suffered a huge blow after Azkals veteran Carlie De Murga was stretchered out of the pitch due to a possible knee injury. He never returned to the game. But Adri\u00e1n Gallardo doubled Ceres\u2019 cushion with a header at the 22nd minute as they held a comfortable 2-nil halftime lead. In the second half, Global got a boost when Mark Hartmann connected with a long distance shot from outside the box off a Misagh Bahadoran feed to trim their deficit, 2\u20131. Global then got another break a few minutes after as Ceres team captain Juani Guirado was sent off after being involved in a scuffle that saw Global goalkeeper Patrick Deyto hurt after a Ceres player accidentally hit him in the head. That reduced the newly promoted club to just 10 men, giving Global another shot at tying the match. But Global, despite having plenty of chances at the goal, failed to convert its shots, including a last-second effort which was denied by the Ceres goalkeeper Louie Casas that sealed the result. Ceres managed to hold on and won its first major trophy in the UFL after having been promoted during that season. The victory halted Global's run of back-to-back trophies in the UFL, while effectively throwing into disarray the hierarchy of clubs in the Philippines\u2019 elite domestic competition. Global head coach Leigh Manson was pleased at the interest generated by the spectacular affair. \"Tonight's game, with the amount of fans \u2013 the passion, the drama, the excitement, that's got to be great for the League, for Filipino football,\" he said.", "|Mark Hartmann", "|Mark Hartmann"]}, {"page": "2011 UFL Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Mark Hartmann"]}, {"page": "Khoun Laboravy", "response": ["In early 2018 Boravy was heavily linked with Thai club Ratchaburi Mitr Phol F.C., where he was invited to a week long trial.
