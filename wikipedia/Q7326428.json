The squad was strengthened by Alfred Barker who brought in a new half back line with the arrival of Jimmy McGillvray, Jock Grieve and George Smart. Stoke made a useful start to the season and held a position in the top half of the table, but four defeats either side of Christmas saw them plunge into the bottom five and prospects for the new year did not look too promising. Yet, things did manage to improve on the pitch. Goalkeeper Richard Herron and right-half Sam Baddeley were restored to the first team and forwards John Lenaghan and Tom Revill joined to add some much needed punch up front. Stoke sold both Arthur Cartlidge and Jock Grieve to South Shields for a decent price while Jack Peart joined Newcastle United for \u00a3600.

There was of course sadness as seven players died fighting in the war.  These were goalkeeper Richard Herron, half-backs Henry Hargreaves and Stan Ripley and reserve team players George Limer, Jack Shorthouse, Tom Kinson and Bill Nixon. Stoke's exploits in the War-League not only brought prestige and standing, but also swelled the coffers to the extent of financial stability. It was hoped that the club was set from a bright future and, with virtually everyone retained who had acquitted themselves so well in the war period, promotion was the target. Two Scottish players George Jarvis (from Celtic) and Jock Stirling (from Bradford Park Avenue) joined the forward ranks, whilst goalkeeper Tom Kay became first choice keeper and would go on to make 70 successive appearances."]}, {"page": "Bob Dixon (footballer)", "response": ["Dixon was born in Whitehaven and played for West Stanley before he was spotted by Stoke City's north-eastern scouts who had previously signed another 'keeper Richard Herron from West Stanley. He made his debut in a 5\u20131 victory at Blackburn Rovers but he was at fault for Rovers' goal and was 'not at ease'.  That nervy display convinced the management that he needed a spell in the reserves, and was replaced by Gilbert Brookes and played just one more match in 1922\u201323. Early in the 1923\u201324 season Dixon won his place back this time from Scottish international Ken Campbell. New manager Tom Mather installed Dixon as his first choice and he went on to conceded just three goals in three months and banish memories of his awkward debut.  Rarely seen without his cloth cap, Dixon's courage during the relegation battle of 1924\u201325 dug his errant defenders out of the mire on numerous occasions and was not afraid to throw himself at oncoming forwards feet often leading to personal injury. Following errors in a 3\u20130 home defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers in March 1925, Dixon was dropped."]}, {"page": "Bert Gadsden", "response": ["Gadsden was born in Nottingham and played amateur football with Standen Hill Victoria before joining Stoke in 1912.
