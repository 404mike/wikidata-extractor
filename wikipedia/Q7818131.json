Trevor Arnott had dismissed Tom Young a number of times in the previous two season perhaps explaining why his name came to mind."]}, {"page": "Tom Young", "response": ["Tom Young may refer to:", "*Tom Young (basketball) (born 1932), American college basketball coach", "*Tom Young (cricketer) (1890\u20131936), English cricketer", "*Tom Young (American football) (1907\u20131973), American college football coach in the 1940s and 1950s", "*Tom Young (Australian footballer) (born 1992), Australian rules footballer", "*Tom Young (novelist) (born 1962), American novelist", "*Tom Young (trade unionist) (1870\u20131953), New Zealand seaman and trade unionist", "*Tom Young (baseball) (1902\u2013?), Negro leagues utility player", "*Tom Youngs (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Sydney Rippon", "response": ["In six out of the ten seasons between 1920 and 1929, he made centuries, but never more than one in any season, and his total of runs in a season never exceeded 600. Among his centuries was one of 118, made in Somerset's first-ever first-class match against Glamorgan in 1921. He put on 189 for the first wicket with the dashing Peter Randall Johnson, who made 123 of the runs; Rippon was, by implication in Wisden's report, much slower, though his runs came in 190 minutes. His highest innings was 133 against Worcestershire at the Knowle ground in 1927, the runs being made out of 314 runs while he was at the wicket: he \"wore down the attack\", wrote Wisden, and \"showed such patience in waiting for the right ball to hit that he did not give a chance\". Not all of his batting was slow, however: in 1928, the last of his centuries was 112 against Hampshire and he put on 197 for the first wicket with Tom Young, the runs coming in less than 150 minutes."]}, {"page": "Lansdown Cricket Club", "response": ["Lansdown has had a number of talented professionals through the years.  The Somerset opener Tom Young spent some time at the club in 1910, and the brothers Jack and Frank Lee played for the club while qualifying for Somerset in the 1920s.  In the postwar years, the mainstay of the batting for many years was Les Angell, whose prolific scoring for Lansdown masked a more modest record in first-class cricket for Somerset. Almost overlapping with Angell, in 1973, Viv Richards similarly turned out for the side while he served his qualification period for Somerset.  During his time at the club he not only entertained the crowd with his runs, but also cut the grass for the club."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Tom Young", "|align=left|Tom Young", "|align=left|Tom Young", "|align=left|Tom Young", "|align=left|Tom Young"]}, {"page": "Louis Powell", "response": ["Powell was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He was a prominent member of Bath Cricket Club, and eight of his 10 first-class matches were played at Bath. His debut in 1927, however, was at Taunton and the three Lancashire wickets he took in that game amounted to more than half his first-class career total. In his Obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1996, Powell's batting in this match was also discussed: \"He was... forced to face Ted McDonald in full cry when he went out to bat (at) No 10...: the senior pro Tom Young noticed his pads were not good enough, loaned him his and Powell made 22.\" Powell played a couple of matches in 1927 and then one in 1928, but reappeared more regularly in matches at Bath from 1934 to 1938. His first match on his return was his most successful: still batting at No 10, he made 52 against Hampshire sharing a ninth wicket stand of 97 (Wisden says 101) with Jack White."]}, {"page": "List of Players cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Tom Young (1925\u20131928)"]}]}}
