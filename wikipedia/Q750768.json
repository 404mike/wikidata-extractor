The Board's initial report offered suggestions for how the play could be adapted to secure an A certificate (suitable for children if accompanied by an adult), including shifting the play's focus away from Sally Bowles, but recognized that such changes were unlikely because of how markedly they would depart from the original play.Aldgate and Robertson, pp. 66\u201367", "Director Henry Cornelius asked Isherwood to write the screenplay.
