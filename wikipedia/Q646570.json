The Germans chasing Voss found themselves stalemated by British Sopwith Camels, as well as some SPADs and Bristol F.2 Fighters patrolling under the overcast. Two flights of the elite 56 Squadron formed a lower layer of British patrols at 1,800\u00a0meters (6,000\u00a0feet) altitude. Below that, Lieutenant Harold A. Hamersley, flying as a rear guard to his squadronmates in 60 Squadron, had a wary eye on a nearby enemy formation of 20 to 25 German aircraft.Diggens 2003, p. 82. At about 18:25 hours, he turned to help what he believed to be a Nieuport threatened by a German Albatros, firing a short burst of machine-gun fire to distract the German. The \"Nieuport\", Voss's misidentified Fokker Triplane, rounded on Hamersley and raked him with Spandau fire. Hamersley flung his Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a into a spin that went inverted, with Voss continuing to fire at him, holing his wings and engine cowling. Lieutenant Robert L. Chidlaw-Roberts, a squadronmate of Hamersley, rushed to his aid. Within seconds, Voss shredded Chidlaw-Roberts's rudder bar, also driving him out of the fray into a forced landing."]}, {"page": "No. 60 Squadron RAF", "response": ["* Robert L.

After attending the 2nd Royal Flying Corps School of Instruction, he was subsequently posted to No. 60 Squadron on the Western Front to pilot a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a in September 1917. On the 16th, he promptly scored his first victory, destroying an Albatros D.III. On the 22nd, he shared a victory as he helped Captain Robert L. Chidlaw-Roberts become an ace by driving down an Albatros D.III out of control. The following day, Hamersley almost became Werner Voss's 49th victim; Voss shot up his SE.5a before being shot down and killed by a patrol from 56 Squadron. Hamersley survived unhurt. He continued to score; on 18 November, he scored his sixth and last win for 1917, again teaming with Chidlaw-Roberts as they destroyed a DFW reconnaissance plane."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Robert L.
