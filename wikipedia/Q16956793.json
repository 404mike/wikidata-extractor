The musical video parodies the DC Comics limited series Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, portraying the opening sequence of a fictional 1980s Saturday morning cartoon based on the series. The video was animated, written, composed and sung by Harry Partridge and voiced by Partridge, Joshua Tomar, and Hans Van Harken. In stark contrast to the comic, it has a cheerful, upbeat tone, poking fun at the tendency of the campy nature of 1980s animation to sanitize superheroes and other violent themes. It features many of the mainstays of 1980s cartoon films, like catchy rock themes, and references to the openings of Thundercats, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Jem, The Legend of Zelda, and Scooby-Doo. On the Newgrounds site, Partridge stated the video \"combines two huge passions of mine, one being the comic genius that is Alan Moore and the other being kids' programming from the late '80s, which I would say is my biggest animation inspiration.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Garden of Earthly Delights", "response": ["\"Garden of Earthly Delights\" is a song written by Andy Partridge of the English rock band XTC, released as the opening track on their 1989 album Oranges & Lemons.

He intended it to sound \"like this crazy tapestry of camels and elephants and belly dancers and all the Arabian Nights, interwoven -- a big ornate Eastern rug come to life.\" It features Arabic modalities and a guitar solo played through two harmonizers set to different intervals.", "Andy Partridge wrote \"Garden of Earthly Delights\" as a children's guide to the world dedicated to his son Harry Partridge. He said the song stemmed from \"a little musical figure\" he found playing a guitar's D string, which led to the lyrics and Arabic feel. Partridge had used the name as a working title for the theme to the 1983 film Ocean's Daughter. In the liner notes to Fuzzy Warbles, he wrote that the theme's melody \"was from a song I was working on [at the time] called 'Garden of Earthly Delights'.\" In a 2007 phone interview, he refused to answer whether the lyric \"can't all think like Chekov\" refers to the Star Trek character, Pavel Chekov, or the Russian playwright, Anton Chekhov. In Neville Farmer's 1998 biography Song Stories, it is stated that Partridge had the playwright in mind."]}, {"page": "List of RiffTrax", "response": ["|Animation by Harry Partridge with music by Jonathan Coulton"]}, {"page": "Saturday Morning Watchmen", "response": ["Saturday Morning Watchmen is a Newgrounds and YouTube viral video published on March 5, 2009, the day before the release of the live-action Watchmen film.
