The decision to establish the university was, in part, a response to the already-thriving University of Paris.Darwin Porter, Frommer's Provence & the Riviera, Wiley Publishing, Inc., 2010, p. 20 As a result, in order to be sure of the viability of the new institution, Louis II compelled his Proven\u00e7al students to study in Aix only.Walter R\u00fcegg, Hilde de Ridder-Symoens, A History of the University in Europe, Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 105 Thus, the letters patent for the university were granted, and the government of the university was created. The Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence, Thomas de Pupio, was appointed as the first chancellor of the university for the rest of his life. After his death in 1420, a new chancellor was elected by the rector, masters, and licentiates \u2013 an uncommon arrangement not repeated at any other French university. The rector was to be an \"ordinary student\", who had unrestricted civil and criminal jurisdiction in all cases where one party was a doctor or scholar of the university. Those displeased with the rector's decisions could appeal to a doctor legens. Eleven consiliarii provided assistance to the rector, being elected yearly by their predecessors. These individuals represented all faculties, but were elected from among the students. The constitution was of a student-university, and the instructors did not have great authority except in granting degrees.Carol Summerfield, Mary Elizabeth Devine, International Dictionary of University Histories, Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1998, p. 418 A resident doctor or student who married was required to pay charivari to the university, the amount varying with the degree or status of the man, and being increased if the bride was a widow. Refusal to submit to this statutable extortion was punished by the assemblage of students at the summons of the rector with frying-pans, bassoons, and horns at the house of the newly married couple. Continued recusancy was followed by the piling up of dirt in front of their door upon every Feast-day. These injunctions were justified on the ground that the money extorted was devoted to divine service.Hastings Rashdall, The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, Volume 2 \u2013 Part 2, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 648"]}]}}
