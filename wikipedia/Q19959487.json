She trained as a teacher at Furzedown Training College, and taught at a primary school in south-east London. While teaching she studied in the evenings at Birkbeck, University of London, obtaining a first class B.Sc. in zoology. She then took up full-time studies and gained her doctorate in 1936.

She was awarded the 1986 Frink Medal from the Zoological Society of London: \"for her contributions to the understanding of the developmental biology, physiological ecology and functional morphology of the prosobranch molluscs\". British Prosobranch Molluscs was originally published in 1962 by The Ray Society, and republished in a revised and updated edition in 1994.Fretter was President of the Malacological Society of London for three years from 1966-9.
