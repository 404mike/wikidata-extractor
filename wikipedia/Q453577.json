He wrote prolifically into the 1890s, after which his output declined, in part due to struggles with alcoholism and mental illness. At times destitute, he spent periods in Darlinghurst Gaol and psychiatric institutions.

His earliest work was a poem criticising the British war in the Sudan, which also had Australian participation. Over the next decade, the influential journal provided an important platform for Paterson's work, which appeared under the pseudonym of \"The Banjo\", the name of his favourite horse. As one of its most popular writers through the 1890s, he formed friendships with other significant writers in Australian literature, such as E.J. Brady, Harry \"Breaker\" Morant, Will H.

Lawrence that led to his \"discovery of Australia\" as he became convinced that the story of Australia had not been properly told by historians, and the Australians had a past to be proud of.Hughes-Warrington, Fifty Key Thinkers on History, p.34 Clark was also disappointed by the treatment afforded by historians of \"dinkum\" Australians (i.e ordinary Australians, so-called because they spoke the \"dinkum\" variety of English) with their values of mateship, egalitarianism and anti-elitism with the \"dinkum\" people being portrayed as almost a national disgrace.Hughes-Warrington, Fifty Key Thinkers on History, p.34 Clark argued it was time for Australian intellectuals to stop treating Great Britain as the model of excellence to which Australians should strive to meet, writing that Australia should be treated as an entity in its own right.Hughes-Warrington, Fifty Key Thinkers on History, p.34 However, Clark himself was critical of \"dinkum\" Australians, albeit from another direction as he maintained that values such as mateship were mere \"comforters\" that helped to make life in colonial Australia with its harsh environment more bearable, and failed to provide a means to fundamentally change society.Hughes-Warrington, Fifty Key Thinkers on History, p.34 Clark stated that he did not know what were the new values that Australian society needed, but the historians had the duty to start such a debate.Hughes-Warrington, Fifty Key Thinkers on History, p.34 A major problem for Australian historians in the 1940s was that most of the primary sources relating to the colonial period were held in archives in Britain, making research expensive and time-consuming.Hughes-Warrington, Fifty Key Thinkers on History, p.34 Starting in 1946, Clark together with L.J. Pryor collected documentary material relating to the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788,  the transportation of convicts to the penal colony and the squatter living illegally in the bush with the aim of publishing them to make them more accessible to historians.Hughes-Warrington, Fifty Key Thinkers on History, p.34 \u00a0  \u00a0", "In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Commission invited Clark to give the 1976 Boyer Lectures, a series of lectures which were broadcast and later published as A Discovery of Australia. The Boyer lectures allowed Clark to describe many of the core ideas of his published work and indeed his own life in characteristic style. \"Everything a historian writes,\" he stated for example, \"should be a celebration of life, a hymn of praise to life. It should come up from inside a man who knows all about that horror of the darkness when a man returns to the dust from whence he came, a man who has looked into the heart of that great darkness, but has both a tenderness for everyone, and yet, paradoxically, a melancholy, a sadness, and a compassion because what matters most in life is never likely to happen\".CMH Clark. Discovery of Australia. 1976 Boyer Lectures Australian Broadcasting Commission Sydney 1976 p12. Clark's next work, In Search of Henry Lawson (1979), was a reworking of an essay which was originally written in 1964 as a chapter for Geoffrey Dutton's pioneering The Literature of Australia. It was worked up in some haste in response to the desire of the Macmillan publishing house for a new book with which they could cash in on Clark's popularity. Predictably, and with more than usual justification, Clark saw Lawson as another of his tragic heroes, and he wrote with a good deal of empathy of Lawson's losing battle with alcoholism: a fate Clark himself had narrowly avoided by giving up drink in the 1960s. But the book showed both its age and its haste of preparation, and was savaged by Colin Roderick, the leading authority on Lawson, as \"a tangled thicket of factual errors, speculation and ideological interpretation\".Holt, A Short History, 187", "Clark was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1975. He won the Moomba Book Award and the Henry Lawson Arts Award in 1969, the Australian Literature Society's Gold Medal in 1970, Age Book Prize in 1974 and the New South Wales Premier's Literary Award in 1979. He was awarded  honorary doctorates by the Universities of Melbourne, Newcastle and Sydney. In 1980 he was named Australian of the Year."]}, {"page": "St. Matthews Central School, Mudgee", "response": ["A Catholic school was first established in Mudgee in the 19th century.
