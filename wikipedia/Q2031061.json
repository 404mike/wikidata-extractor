Soon after the move, Damian's \"hermitage\" in a cardboard box (which is by the train tracks) is disturbed by a bag of money flung from a passing train. Damian immediately shows the money to his brother, 12 year old Anthony (Lewis Owen McGibbon), and the two begin thinking of what to do with it. Anthony wants the money all to himself. Damian, kind-hearted and religious, had recently overheard three Latter-day Saint missionaries lecture other members of the community on building foundations of rock rather than foundations of sand, an old Christian principle which dictates that self-worth should be based on the teachings of Jesus Christ rather than any other object of worship such as wealth or power. The lecture inspires Damian, who looks for ways to give his share of the money to the poor; at one point he even stuffs a bundle of cash through the missionaries' letter box, having heard about their modest lifestyle and deciding that they too must be poor.", "* Alex Etel as Damian Cunningham", "*Nominated, Most Promising Newcomer: Alex Etel", "*Nominated, Best Young Actor: Alex Etel", "*Nominated, Best Performance by a Younger Actor: Alex Etel"]}, {"page": "Alex etal", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alex Etel"]}, {"page": "Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer", "response": ["** Alex Etel as Damian Cunningham \u2013 Millions"]}, {"page": "11th Critics' Choice Awards", "response": ["* Alex Etel \u2013 Millions as Damian Cunningham"]}, {"page": "British Independent Film Awards 2005", "response": ["* Alex Etel - Millions"]}, {"page": "1994 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 19 September \u2013 Alex Etel, English actor"]}, {"page": "32nd Saturn Awards", "response": ["* Alex Etel - Millions as Damian Cunningham"]}, {"page": "Alexander Etel", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alex Etel"]}, {"page": "List of people from Stockport", "response": ["*Alex Etel (born 1994), English actor known for Millions and The Water Horse"]}, {"page": "List of comedy films of the 2000s", "response": ["|Millions||Danny Boyle||Alex Etel, Lewis McGibbon, James Nesbitt ||United Kingdom||Comedy-drama"]}, {"page": "List of fantasy films of the 2000s", "response": ["|The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep||Jay W.
