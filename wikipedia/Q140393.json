After retiring from racing in 1979, Hunt became a media commentator and businessman.\nBeginning his racing career in touring car racing, Hunt progressed into Formula Three, where he attracted the attention of the Hesketh Racing team and soon came under their wing. Hunt's often reckless and action-packed exploits on track earned him the nickname \"Hunt the Shunt\" (shunt, as a British motor-racing term, means \"crash\"). Hunt entered Formula One in 1973, driving a March 731 entered by the Hesketh Racing team. He went on to win for Hesketh, driving their own Hesketh 308 car, in both World Championship and non-championship races, before joining the McLaren team at the end of 1975. In his first year with McLaren, Hunt won the 1976 World Drivers' Championship, and he remained with the team for a further two years, although with less success, before moving to the Wolf team in early 1979. Following a string of races in which he failed to finish, Hunt retired from driving halfway through the 1979 season.\nAfter retiring from motor racing, he established a career as a motor racing commentator for the BBC. He died from a heart attack aged 45.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 29", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 James Hunt, English race car driver and sportscaster (d. 1993)"]}, {"page": "June 15", "response": ["*  1993   \u2013 James Hunt, English racing driver and sportscaster (b. 1947)"]}, {"page": "McLaren", "response": ["Founded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971.
