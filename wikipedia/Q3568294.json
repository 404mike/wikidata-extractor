Joining Walters in the pack were international debuts for Will Osborne, Will Joseph, Arthur Harding and Dai \"Tarw\" Jones. Adding to the unfamiliarity of the forwards was the fact that of the eight men, only Jehoida Hodges and George Boots played for the same club as each other. Under the captaincy of Gwyn Nicholls, the Welsh were victorious by a single point, thanks to a penalty goal from John Strand-Jones. Despite the win, Walters was the only member of the Welsh pack to lose his place for the next game, being replaced by Harry Jones of Penygraig.

Osborne was one of seven new caps, four of whom joined Osborne in a much changed pack. Although lacking international experience many of the players winning their first caps that day went on to form the nucleus of the Wales team that beat The Original All Blacks in 1905, including Arthur Harding, Will Joseph, and fellow collier Dai \"Tarw\" Jones. In a very close encounter, Osbourne scored his one and only international try on his d\u00e9but; Wales then won the game through a late penalty goal from John Strand-Jones. Osborne was then reselected to face Scotland in the second game of the series, played on Welsh home soil at the Cardiff Arms Park. The Scottish Rugby Union stated that they would refuse to face Wales if Osborne played, as there were rumours that he had accepted and signed a professional contract with a rugby league team. This was illegal under rugby union rules, which was a purely amateur sport. Osborne was forced to make a full statement denying the claim, and the match went ahead with Osborne in the Welsh pack.Jenkins (1991), pg 121. The only change to the Welsh team from the previous match was Harry Jones coming in for Lanelli's Nathaniel Walters, and the more fluent Welsh play resulted in a victory over a very gifted Scottish team.Godwin (1987), pg 66.
