In March 1881 he became chief commissioner of Assam, and in Feb. 1886 was entrusted with the unpopular task of presiding over a committee appointed to inquire into public expenditure throughout India, and report on economies. A falling exchange and a heavy bill for war operations compelled Lord Dufferin to apply the shears to provincial expenditure, and while the committee inevitably withdrew funds needed by the local governments, it was generally recognised that immense pains were taken by Elliott and his colleagues. Elliott, who had been made C.S.I. in 1878, was promoted K.C.S.I. in 1887, and from 6 January 1888 to 17 December 1890 he was a member successively of Lord Dufferin's and then of Lord Lansdowne's executive councils. On the retirement of Sir Steuart Bayley, Elliott, although he had never served in Bengal, became lieutenant-governor of that province, holding the post, save for a short leave in 1893, until 18 Dec. 1895. The greatest service which Elliott rendered to Bengal was the prosecution of the survey and the compilation of the record of rights in Bihar, carried out in spite of much opposition from the zemindars, opposition that received some support from Lord Randolph Churchill. Sir Antony MacDonnell's views as to the maintenance of the record were not in harmony with those of Elliott, but Lord Lansdowne intervened to reduce the controversy to its proper dimensions. Public opinion has finally endorsed the opinion expressed by Mr. C. E. Buckland in Bengal under the Lieutenant-Governors (1901), that \"there was not another man in India who could have done the settlement work he did in Bihar and Bengal, so much of it and so well.\" In his zeal for the public service Elliott courageously faced unpopularity. Economy as well as efficiency were his principles of government. Towards the native press he took a firm attitude, prosecuting the editor and manager of the Bangobasi for sedition in the teeth of hostile criticism. He was inclined to establish a press bureau, but Lord Lansdowne's government did not sanction his proposals. With the distressed Eurasian community he showed generous sympathy, and, always on the watch for the well-being of the masses he pushed on sanitary and medical measures, being largely instrumental in the widespread distribution of quinine as a remedy against fever. In foreign affairs he was impatient of Chinese delays in the delimitation of the frontiers of Tibet and Sikkim, and urged Lord Elgin to occupy the Chambi Valley (19 November 1895), and even to annex it."]}, {"page": "Stuart Colvin Bayley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steuart Bayley"]}, {"page": "Jorehaut Provincial Railway", "response": ["In 1885, a narrow gauge train services Jorehaut Provincial Railway had come into operation and ultimately became instrumental in the rapid growth of the tea industry. The first railway junction in Assam was Makum Junction on the Dibru-Sadiya Railway (DSR) line, and the second junction was Cinnamara of the Jorehaut Provincial Railway (JPR). The former railway line had proven its practicability. The chief commissioner of Assam, Steuart Bayley, was so enthralled by the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR), that he authorized the construction of a railway line in Jorehat in 1882 at an estimated cost of 111,320 Indian Rupees. This cost was to be paid from the provincial revenues of Assam without obtaining the sanction of the Government of India."]}]}}
