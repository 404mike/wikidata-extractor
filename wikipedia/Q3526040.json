He was born at Blackheath, London and died at Otford, Kent.\nAlthough he played only seven Tests, his Test batting average of 64.85, including two centuries and one fifty, is twice his overall first-class cricket record of 30.15 with 35 centuries and 90 fifties in 399 first-class matches. He played in just two Test series, scoring 179 runs in two tests against India on the 1933/34 tour with a best of 136 in less than 3 hours on debut in Bombay.  He amassed 275 runs in 5 matches against South Africa on the 1938/39 MCC tour, including a score of 112 in 2 hours, 40 minutes in Cape Town in the Second Test of the series. His final Test was the famous 'timeless test' in Durban which saw England's last innings cut short at 654/5 when they were forced to catch the boat home after 10 days of cricket.   Valentine ended the match on 4 not out.\nValentine was educated at Repton School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. He represented Cambridge University at cricket in 1928 and 1929, and also won a Blue for soccer. His long career at Kent County Cricket Club as a right-handed batsman and occasional medium pacer spanned two decades from 1927 to 1948.  He was awarded his Kent cap in 1931 and captained the county on occasion during the 1930s in the absence of Percy Chapman; in 1937 he shared the captaincy with Ronnie Bryan.  Following Gerry Chalk's death in World War II Valentine captained Kent again between 1946 and 1948 before being succeeded by David Clark.\nAn attacking batsman whose defence improved with experience in the first-class arena, he was particularly strong through the leg side but his Test appearances were limited by the strength of the England team at the time.  His highest score, 242, was made for Kent against Leicestershire at Oakham in 1938.   A limited bowler, he was an excellent all round fielder equally at home in the covers or catching close to the wicket.\nDuring World War II Valentine served with the Royal West Kent Regiment and was awarded the Military Cross \"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in North Africa\". He returned to cricket despite being badly wounded during hostilities.  He was President of Kent County Cricket Club in 1967 and served on the cricket committee for many years.\nHis sister, Carol, also played test cricket for England women's cricket team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kent County Cricket Club", "response": ["Gerry Chalk had captained the side in 1939 when they had, once again, finished in the top five of the Championship, but he was killed during World War II and the post-war period saw Kent struggle to compete consistently.

The team was again captained by Bryan Valentine and featured England stars Godfrey Evans and Doug Wright, though they missed several championship matches for Test calls. Kent were particularly well served by their batsmen, although Valentine had problems with loss of form at times. Les Ames, Les Todd and Arthur Fagg all scored more than 2,000 runs in the season. The young left-hander Peter Hearn was regarded as a fine prospect and was awarded his county cap. Wright was the main bowler and was supported by off spinner Ray Dovey, all-rounder Jack Davies and the two pacemen Fred Ridgway and Norman Harding. Harding died unexpectedly in September, aged 31.Wisden 1948 \u2013 obituary, p. 783. Other players included Geoffrey Anson, Brian Edrich, the veteran Hopper Levett in his final season, Tony Mallett, future captain Bill Murray-Wood and Tony Pawson. A curious case was pace bowler Jack Martin, who played for Kent only twice in 1947 and yet was selected to play for England in the Trent Bridge Test.Playfair, pp. 89\u201390.", "At the beginning of the season, on 3, 5 and 6 May, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) played a three-day match at Lord's against the 1946 county champions, Yorkshire. MCC won by 163 runs. The MCC team in batting order was Dennis Brookes (Northamptonshire), Jack Robertson (Middlesex), Bob Wyatt (Worcestershire), Denis Compton (Middlesex), Bryan Valentine (Kent, captain), Leslie Compton (Middlesex, wicketkeeper), Wilf Wooller (Glamorgan), Haydn Davies (Glamorgan), Jack Young (Middlesex), Rowland Shaddick (Middlesex) and Jack Martin (Kent). MCC won the toss and chose to bat first but were bowled out in 57 overs for 134, Denis Compton making 73. Yorkshire got off to a very bad start when Len Hutton was dismissed by Jack Martin for nought. This began an outstanding spell for Martin who finished with six for 23 from 12.1 overs as Yorkshire collapsed to 81 all out. At close of play on the Saturday, MCC were 67 for one with Jack Robertson 36 not out. On the Monday, Robertson built a big innings and scored 164 of a declared total of 343 for 9. Yorkshire's hopes slumped when Hutton was again dismissed cheaply and at close of play they were 69 for two. Vic Wilson tried his best and scored 74, which was his highest career score to date, but Jack Young was in fine form and took six for 85 to win the match for MCC.CricketArchive \u2013 MCC v Yorkshire 1947.
