After making his first-team debut in 2010, he attracted the interest of a number of clubs including Blackburn Rovers, for whom he signed in September 2011 for a \u00a31.1 million fee. Slew also made two appearances for the England U19s in 2011. He subsequently spent time on loan at Stevenage, Oldham Athletic, Rotherham United, Ross County, and Port Vale.

Defeat to local rivals Crewe Alexandra marked the club's fifth consecutive loss, and after the game Adams accepted that his position would be under threat if results did not turn around quickly. Following six straight defeats Adams resigned as manager on 18 September after lengthy discussions with the chairman. The club would decline and suffer relegation after his departure, leading Adams to say in 2018 that: \"I\u2019m sad to see the Vale where they are. A couple of things about the Vale: To the players\u2026 liven yourselves up, and secondly to Norman Smurthwaite, sell the club for God\u2019s sake.\""]}, {"page": "Tom Pope", "response": ["He opened the 2014\u201315 campaign by scoring in each of the first four games of the season. After Rob Page took over as caretaker-manager in September, Pope said that he was happy to act as a \"battering ram\" to help create chances for new signing Jordan Slew. The following month Pope was named as a transfer target by Barnsley manager Danny Wilson, and an unnamed Championship club also had a formal approach to Port Vale turned down. Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite told him that a new contract offer in the summer would mean a 50% reduction in his wages, despite other clubs indicating they would pay him almost double his current wage. In late October he picked up a knee injury and was ruled out of action for three months after undergoing surgery. He managed to finish as the club's top-scorer for the third successive season despite admitting that he was not fully fit at any point following his recovery from injury."]}, {"page": "Scott Fox", "response": ["Following a bad ankle injury in late 2013, Fox was replaced by substitute keeper and ex-Scotland international Paul Gallacher for the remainder of the 2013\u201314 Scottish Premiership season.

Another 0\u20130 draw followed three days later, on 20 March, as Stevenage played out a goalless draw against Colchester United at Broadhall Way. Stevenage played the second-half with ten men, after striker Jordan Slew was sent-off just before the interval for \"lashing out\" at Colchester midfielder Anthony Wordsworth. An away trip to the Bescot Stadium to play Walsall on 24 March followed, ending in a 1\u20131 draw. The home side took an early lead when Walsall defender Andy Butler turned in area and found the bottom right hand corner of the goal. Stevenage equalised on the hour mark, Jennison Myrie-Williams made room down the left wing, before his attempted cross was blocked, the ball fell into the path of Michael Bostwick who curled the ball into the net from 25\u00a0yards out. A seventh draw in eight games was played out three days later, with Stevenage drawing 2\u20132 at home with Bournemouth. All four goals came in the first half of the match, with Bournemouth taking a two-goal lead before two Stevenage goals within the space of seven minutes meant the teams went into the break level. The visitors opened the scoring through Wesley Thomas' half volley that found the top right corner of the goal. Bournemouth then doubled their advantage when Scott Malone made a bursting run from full back before hitting a rasping drive that found the net from the edge of the area. The hosts were looking second best, but reduced the two-goal deficit when Luke Freeman cut in from the left and curled a right footed shot past Bournemouth goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan from 25\u00a0yards. Michael Bostwick scored his second goal in as many games with a low struck effort from the edge of the area, ensuring the two sides went in level at the interval. Another draw followed when Stevenage drew 1\u20131 at home to Wycombe Wanderers. Stevenage took the lead with just ten minutes remaining, Michael Bostwick scoring his third goal in as many games when he made room for himself outside the area after a neat interchange with Scott Laird, before curling an effort that beat Nikki Bull in the Wycombe goal. The away side equalised deep into injury-time when Mark Roberts was adjudged to have halted Craig Eastmond's run into the area illegally; Grant Basey stepped up and converted the resultant penalty.", "Stevenage's nine game unbeaten run was ended on 6 April, losing 3\u20130 away to Tranmere Rovers courtesy of two early goals from on loan striker Jake Cassidy, and a second-half strike from Lucas Akins. Three days later, on 9 April, Stevenage welcomed Preston North End to Broadhall Way, signalling the return of former manager Graham Westley, who left Stevenage in January 2012 to take up the vacant position at Deepdale. The game ended 1\u20131, stretching Stevenage's winless run to seven league games. Preston took the lead with just four minutes remaining, with substitute Iain Hume sliding the ball in from six yards out following Danny Mayor's through ball. Stevenage then equalised in the fourth minute of injury time, with captain Mark Roberts heading in Michael Bostwick's floated cross to ensure a share of the spoils. The result meant that Stevenage were in ninth position, six points away from the final play-off place with just six games remaining. Stevenage travelled to in-form Yeovil Town five days after the draw with Preston, looking to secure a first away win in just under two months. Stevenage won the match 6\u20130, recording their biggest Football League victory to date, as well as recording the joint biggest away victory of 2011\u201312 League One campaign. Stevenage took an early lead in the match when Patrick Agyemang was played into the area by Craig Reid, Agyemang then squared the ball across goal for Luke Freeman to score from close range. Yeovil were reduced to ten men when Michael Woods fouled Michael Bostwick. Agyemang scored Stevenage's second goal when he collected Jamaal Lascelles long pass, before calmly beating Sam Walker in the Yeovil goal. Two goals within the space of three second half minutes put the game beyond doubt, with Jon Ashton and Lascelles scoring headers from set pieces. Mark Roberts added a fifth goal with ten minutes remaining \u2014 prodding in Freeman's centre. Freeman then scored his second, and Stevenage's sixth, when Jordan Slew made room down the right wing after a neat interchange with Agyemang, before finding Freeman at the back post to tap in from six yards out. The club then welcomed play-off rivals Carlisle United to Broadhall Way, knowing that a defeat would virtually end the club's play-off hopes. Stevenage dominated the first-half, but were unable to take an advantage into the interval. The second half was a much more even affair, with both teams spurning goalscoring opportunities. The deadlock was broken with just fifteen minutes remaining, substitute John Mousinho, returning from a six-month injury lay-off, latched onto Stacy Long's chipped through ball, before crashing the ball into the goal off the crossbar. Four days later, on 21 April, Stevenage hosted another team hoping to snatch the final play-off place when Brentford travelled to Broadhall Way. Stevenage secured a 2\u20131 victory, consequently ending Brentford's play-off hopes in the process. The visitors had the opportunity to take the lead on the half hour mark when Jamaal Lascelles was adjudged to have pushed Clinton Morrison in the area. However, Clayton Donaldson's penalty rebounded off the crossbar and Stevenage were able to clear to ensure the teams went in level at half-time. Brentford were then handed another chance from the penalty spot five minutes after the interval, this time the referee deemed Jon Ashton to have fouled Morrison. Brentford's Sam Saunders stepped up and his powerful penalty rebounded off the post and into the arms of Chris Day. Just three minutes after the second penalty miss, Stevenage were one goal to the good. Craig Reid controlled Lawrie Wilson's low cross, before hitting a shot on the turn that bounced off the ground and past Brentford goalkeeper Simon Moore. Luke Freeman then doubled Stevenage's advantage ten minutes later, dispossessing Adam Thompson before cutting in and hitting a right-footed shot that crashed into the goal off the post. Saunders reduced the deficit in injury-time with a curling free-kick, although Stevenage held on to secure a vital victory. The third straight victory, coupled with Notts County's home loss to Bury, meant that Stevenage were back in the play-off places with just two games remaining. Stevenage then travelled to Bramall Lane to face Sheffield United in a game that was televised live on Sky Sports on 28 April, and attracted a crowd of over 30,000 spectators. The game was an evening kick-off, meaning Stevenage had moved down to seventh in the league table as a result of Notts County's 4\u20133 win at Wycombe Wanderers earlier in the day. The game ended 2\u20132, with Stevenage taking a two-goal lead through strikes from Joel Byrom and Scott Laird, before Sheffield United's Richard Cresswell and Matthew Lowton restored parity. The draw meant that Stevenage had regained their place in sixth with just one game remaining.", "|FW|| Jordan Slew || Blackburn Rovers|| 2 March 2012 || 31 May 2012||"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["With Danny Wilson still needing to raise money and trim the wage bill, the Blades had a relatively busy transfer deadline day, allowing Jordan Slew to join Blackburn Rovers for \u00a31.1m, and Daniel Bogdanovi\u0107 to join Blackpool for an undisclosed fee, but turning down another offer from the Seasiders for Stephen Quinn.  The Blades also agreed a deal to take two young midfielders, John Fleck and Kyle Hutton, on loan from Rangers for the remainder of the season, but the deal subsequently fell through due to issues with the paperwork involved.  The team kicked off September by crushing Bury 4\u20130 at Bramall Lane, and then travelled to Scunthorpe United where they maintained their unbeaten start after coming from behind to grab a 1\u20131 draw.  Off the field the restructuring of the club continued with the appointment of former Blades player Julian Winter as Chief Executive to replace the departing Trevor Birch.  Danny Wilson added to his defensive options by signing Marcus Williams on a months loan from Reading, with the defender making his d\u00e9but only hours later, although he was unable to prevent the Blades from crashing to their first league defeat of the season as they were trounced 3\u20130 at home by Huddersfield Town.  Despite this setback the Blades quickly returned to winning ways, reversing the previous scoreline to crush Colchester United 3\u20130 at Bramall Lane.

The Owls were obviously favourites for the cup clash due to being a league above their opposition. However, Wednesday started the game still in 'pre-season mode', while Oldham Athletic played in a competitive manner and scored within seven minutes with Jordan Slew scoring on his debut for the club. Oldham then doubled their lead with defender Jean-Yves Mvoto getting on the scoresheet. The first half was then summed up when debutant Nejc Pe\u010dnik missed a penalty for the Owls. After one of the worst starts to the season, Wednesday came out in the second half a completely different side. Jermaine Johnson pulled one back and then substitute Chris O'Grady nine-minutes later equalised. A great comeback was completed when O'Grady grabbed his second of the game on the seventieth-minute, while last season's promotion hero and new-signing Michail Antonio scored late on to secure Wednesday of the win and a place in the second round. The second-round draw took place on the Wednesday of the same week and the Owls found themselves drawn at home to Premier League side Fulham, with the tie due to be played later on that month. The day before the first league game of the season Wednesday signed young Preston North End midfielder Danny Mayor on a three-year contract. Finally after a long pre-season the league campaign kicked off at 15:00 on 18 August 2012. However, Wednesday started poorly, similarly to the League Cup game earlier in the week against Oldham Athletic. The Owls went behind after a goal from Nathan Tyson, and then Jake Buxton doubled the lead for Derby County, just before the half-hour mark. Chris O'Grady hit a wonderful strike before half-time to make it 2\u20131 at the break.
