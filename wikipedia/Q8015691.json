He is best known for his large scale concrete murals and public works of art from the 1960s and 1970s. His work is often of an abstract or stylised nature with its roots in the traditions of craft and \"buildability\". His use of heavily modelled surfaces created a distinctive language for his predominantly concrete and glass reinforced concrete (GRC) sculptures. After long years of neglect, many of William Mitchell's remaining works in the United Kingdom are now being recognised for their artistic merit and contemporary historic value, and have been granted protective, listed status.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harrods", "response": ["The second memorial, unveiled in 2005 and located by the escalator at door three is entitled Innocent Victims, a bronze statue of the two dancing on a beach beneath the wings of an albatross, a bird said to symbolise the \"Holy Spirit\".Harrods unveils Diana, Dodi statue, CNN.com, 1 September 2005.

On the Sanctuary, symbolically closest to the Baptistery, is the Ambo (or lectern), used for reading the Scriptures. It is covered in fibreglass panels by William Mitchell (similar panels previously covered the three ceremonial doors). The altar [A on Plan], designed by Ronald Weeks, is made of Portland Stone, raised on legs (visible from the side) and contains relics of Pope Pius X (1835\u20131914) and Oliver Plunkett (1625\u20131681).
