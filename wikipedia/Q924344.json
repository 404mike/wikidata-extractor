This impromptu scrimmage served as a key part of Mpenza's brief trial with City and saw him perform well enough, with his scoring of the second goal in the 3\u20130 win, that he was subsequently signed by City two days later (his unattached free agent status permitting him to be signed outside of the January transfer window).
