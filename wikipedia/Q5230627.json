Southampton paid \u00a32000 for his services and acquired \"a half-back with a strong personality and ball-winning abilities\". Hill's resolve and leadership helped steer Saints away from relegation during 1937\u201338, only for him to suffer a series of injuries the following season which sidelined him for long periods."]}, {"page": "Bill Kennedy (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["In August 1936 he was one of several players signed by Southampton manager George Goss as he attempted to rebuild the team that had struggled for several years in the Second Division. Kennedy formed a useful partnership with fellow half-backs Cyril King and Billy Kingdon, but once again the Saints struggled to avoid relegation, finishing 19th in the table. Described by Saints historians Holley & Chalk as \"a reliable centre-half\" he retained his place at the start of the following season before being replaced by David Affleck at the end of September, as new manager Tom Parker re-organised the side following a run of seven games at the start of the season in which Saints lost four and drew three. He spent most of the rest of the season in the reserves, although he was drafted in as an inside forward for the final two games of the season, replacing Ted Bates. In May 1938 he refused a new contract and moved back to Scotland."]}, {"page": "Coylton", "response": ["Professional footballers George Getgood (1892\u20131970) and David Affleck (1912\u20131984) were born in Coylton.  Coylton was also home to one of Ayrshire's celebrated artists.  Robert Bryden (1865\u20131939) was born in the village. After a period working in Ayr, he became a modeller of bronze busts which are highly regarded. Among his works are bronze portraits of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce in Ayr Town Hall.  He also specialised in carved wooded figures, a collection of which are to be found at Rozelle. Bryden is also responsible for the Coylton War Memorial, a stone cross located near the church at the eastern end of the village.  The author George Douglas Brown, notable for his pioneering 1901 novel \"The House with the Green Shutters\", was born in nearby Ochiltree and received his early schooling in Coylton.George Douglas Brown at Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/170161/George-Douglas"]}, {"page": "Tom Carnaby", "response": ["In May 1938, he moved to the south coast to join Southampton of the Football League Second Division.
