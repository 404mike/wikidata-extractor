At United, Armstrong worked very closely alongside reserve team manager and follow scout, Jimmy Murphy, and the youth players that made their debut from the early 1950s onwards are a tribute to their scouting skills. \nEarly in 1953, Joe Armstrong signed 15-year-old Bobby Charlton, who went on to become one of the greatest players in the world, being part of Manchester United's European Cup winning team of 1968 and the 1966 England World Cup winning team.\nAnother notable signing was Duncan Edwards, who broke into the Manchester United first team at the age of 17, was capped for the England team at 18, and gained two Football League championship medals as well as 18 England caps before he died two weeks after being injured in the Munich crash.\nArmstrong died in 1975 at the age of 81.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Charlton", "response": ["On 9 February 1953, then a Bedlington Grammar School pupil, Charlton was spotted playing for East Northumberland schools by Manchester United chief scout Joe Armstrong. Charlton went on to play for England Schoolboys and the 15-year-old signed with United on 1 January 1953, along with Wilf McGuinness, also aged 15. Initially his mother was reluctant to let him commit to an insecure football career, so he began an apprenticeship as an electrical engineer; however, he went on to turn professional in October 1954."]}, {"page": "George Best", "response": ["At the age of 15, Best was discovered in Belfast by Manchester United scout Bob Bishop, whose telegram to United manager Matt Busby read: \"I think I've found you a genius.\"Stephen McGinty, \"Best coming to the end of his life\", The Scotsman, 25 November 2005  His local club Glentoran had previously rejected him for being \"too small and light\".Anne Cadwallader, \"Best too small and light for local club as teen\", Tiscali News, 25 November 2005  Best was subsequently given a trial and signed up by United's chief scout Joe Armstrong. His first time moving to the club, Best quickly became homesick and stayed for only two days before going back home to Northern Ireland. He returned to Manchester and spent two years as an amateur, as English clubs were not allowed to take Northern Irish players on as apprentices. He was given a job as an errand boy on the Manchester Ship Canal, allowing him to train with the club twice a week."]}, {"page": "Matt Busby", "response": ["After the crash, Busby built a new side around Munich survivors including Harry Gregg, Bobby Charlton and Bill Foulkes.

Byrne undertook two years of National Service in the Royal Air Force, where he was not considered good enough to play football and played rugby instead. While playing for Ryder Brow, Byrne came to the attention of United scout Joe Armstrong and was offered amateur terms at the club, turning professional soon after, becoming the first of what would come to be known as the Busby Babes.Morrin, Stephen The Munich Air Disaster \u2013 The True Story behind the Fatal 1958 Crash, Gill Books, 2007, "]}, {"page": "Busby Babes", "response": ["The \"Busby Babes\" is the name given to the group of footballers, recruited and trained by Manchester United F.C. chief scout Joe Armstrong and assistant manager Jimmy Murphy, who progressed from the club's youth team into the first team under the management of the eponymous Matt Busby from the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.

David Pegg, Dennis Viollet, Duncan Edwards, and Bill Foulkes, aged between 16 and 21, all made their first appearances in the 1952\u201353 season. Many of the players at this time were a tribute to the scouting skills of Chief Scout Joe Armstrong (assigned the duty of finding talent in the North of England), Bob Bishop (Belfast), Billy Behan (Dublin) and Bob Harper, underpinned by United's innovative youth policy under Matt Busby. United finished eighth in 1954 and fifth in 1955 before winning the league by an 11-point margin in 1955\u201356 with Tommy Taylor and Dennis Viollet leading the line for a side which had an average age of only 22. Only two players in the 1956 team, Roger Byrne and Johnny Berry, had collected medals in both the 1952 and 1956 title winning campaigns.

In the team that day, Crompton, Carey, Aston, Anderson, Morris, Pearson and Mitten had all come through the youth system. However, this was to be his last major contribution to the club, as he died in 1950, bringing an association with the club of more than 50 years to an end.Dunphy; p.147 His legacy would continue, though, through Joe Armstrong, the man appointed as Rocca's replacement in the role of chief scout. Like Rocca, Armstrong would seek out the best young players in the Manchester area, and even further afield as the North East of England, where he discovered a 15-year-old Bobby Charlton in 1953.Dunphy; pp.181\u2013182"]}, {"page": "United Trinity", "response": ["Charlton was a member of the Busby Babes, a group of talented young players brought through the club's academy by the eponymous manager Matt Busby and his assistant Jimmy Murphy, as well as club scout Joe Armstrong, who discovered Charlton in 1953 and Best in 1961, among others.
