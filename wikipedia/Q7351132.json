He became active in his union, the National Amalgamated Labourers' Union, at the age of 16 and eventually became its president. He also served as a Labour Party councillor in Swansea from 1910 to 1912.In 1912, Williams was elected as the first secretary of the National Transport Workers' Federation. In this role, he unsuccessfully campaigned for its affiliates to amalgamate into a single union. He opposed World War I, and was a leading member of the Union of Democratic Control. An active member of the Labour Party, he stood in Aberavon at the 1918 general election, but as a supporter of the October Revolution, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920.In 1920 he was part of a deputation of British trade unionists who travelled to Moscow for talks on the founding of a new trade union international, which was formed the following year as the Red International of Labour Unions.  That year, he was elected as President of the International Transport Workers' Federation, and served five years in that position.Although the Transport Workers were signatories to the Triple Alliance, allying them with the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) and the National Union of Railwaymen, on 15 April 1921 Williams decided not to support strike action in support of miners who had seen their wages cut, a decision which became known as \"Black Friday\". He was expelled from the Communist Party, and renewed his membership of the Labour Party the following year.Williams stood unsuccessfully for Labour in Coventry at the 1923 and 1924 general elections, but was elected to the National Executive Committee of the party, serving as its chair in 1925. However, after criticising the attitude of the miners during the 1926 general strike, he was de-selected. He also stood down from his National Transport Workers' Federation post, the organisation having become increasingly irrelevant with the establishment of the Transport and General Workers' Union.Williams also played a prominent role in establishing the Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union in 1922 as an NTWF-sponsored rival to Havelock Wilson's shipowner-friendly National Union of Seamen.  From 1922 until 1930, Williams was General Manager of the Daily Herald.Following his removal from all his labour movement posts, Williams supported Ramsay MacDonald's National Labour Party split. Unable to find regular work, he committed suicide in 1936.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Williams", "response": ["* Robert Williams (actor) (1894\u20131931), American stage and film actor", "* Chocolate Williams (Robert Williams Jr., 1916\u20131984), jazz bassist and blues vocalist", "* Robert Williams (drummer) (born 1955), Captain Beefheart, Hugh Cornwell, and solo", "* Robert Williams (Robert ap Gwilym Ddu) (1767\u20131850), Welsh-language poet", "* Robert Williams (Trebor Mai) (1830\u20131877), Welsh-language poet", "* Robert Williams (artist) (born 1943), cartoonist and painter", "* Robert Williams (poet) (1744\u20131815), British poet", "* Robert Williams (adjutant general) (1829\u20131901), American brigadier general and Adjutant General of the US Army", "* Robert Williams (Medal of Honor) (1837\u2013unknown), American sailor and Medal of Honor recipient", "* Sir Robert Williams, 2nd Baronet (c. 1627\u20131678), MP for Carnarvonshire, 1656\u20131658, and for Carnarvon Boroughs, 1659", "* Sir Robert Williams, 9th Baronet (1764\u20131830) of Penryn, MP for Carnarvonshire, 1790\u20131826, and for Beaumaris, 1826\u20131831", "* Sir Robert Williams, 1st Baronet, of Bridehead (1848\u20131943), Conservative MP for West Dorset, 1895\u20131922", "* Robert Williams (died 1763) (1695\u20131763), MP for Montgomeryshire, 1740\u20131741 and 1742\u20131747", "* Robert Williams (1735\u20131814), MP for Dorchester, 1807\u20131812", "* Robert Williams (1767\u20131847), MP for Dorchester, 1812\u20131835", "* Robert Williams (1811\u20131890), MP for Dorchester, 1835\u20131841", "* Robert Williams (Mississippi politician) (1773\u20131836), Governor of the Mississippi Territory", "* Robert Williams (Victorian politician) (1870\u20131938), Australian politician", "* Robert Williams (archdeacon of Carmarthen) (1863\u20131938), historian and Anglican priest", "* Robert Williams (archdeacon of Gower) (born 1951), Welsh Anglican priest", "* Robert Williams (American priest) (1955\u20131992), first openly gay male priest in the American Episcopal Church", "* Sir Robert Williams, 1st Baronet, of Park (1860\u20131938), Scottish mining engineer, explorer, and railway developer", "* Robert Williams (physician) (1916\u20132003), Welsh pathologist", "* Robert Williams (English chemist) (1926\u20132015), Professor of Oxford University", "* Robert Williams (psychologist) (born 1930), second president of the Association of Black Psychologists", "* Robert Williams (astronomer) (born 1940), director of STScI 1993\u201398; president of IAU, 2009\u20132012", "* Robert Williams (physicist) (born 1941), Welsh physicist and academic", "* Robert Williams (quarterback), football player for Notre Dame, 1956\u20131958", "* Robert Williams (cornerback) (born 1962), former American football cornerback", "* Robert Williams (defensive back) (born 1977), former American football cornerback", "* Robert Williams (baseball) (1917\u20132000), American baseball pitcher and infielder in the Negro leagues", "* Robert Williams (basketball) (born 1997), American professional basketball player, played collegiately for Texas A&M", "* Robert Williams (Grambling State basketball), American college basketball player for Grambling State", "*Robert Williams (footballer, born 1927), English footballer for Wrexham and Shrewsbury Town", "*Robert Williams (footballer, born 1932), English footballer for Mansfield Town", "* Robert Williams (archer) (1841\u20131914), American archer", "* Robert Williams (South African cricketer) (1912\u20131984), South African cricketer", "* Robert Williams (English cricketer) (born 1970), former English cricketer", "* Robert Williams (geometer) (born 1942), American designer, mathematician, and architect", "* Robert Williams (robot fatality) (1953\u20131979), the first person to be killed by a robot", "* Robert Williams (trade union leader) (1881\u20131936), British trade union organizer", "* Vila Robert Williams, former name of Ca\u00e1la, Angola"]}, {"page": "National Transport Workers' Federation", "response": [":1912: Robert Williams"]}, {"page": "International Transport Workers' Federation", "response": [":1920: Robert Williams"]}, {"page": "Black Friday (1921)", "response": ["Despite the decision against fully-fledged strike action, transport and railworkers were ordered not to handle imported coal. Some workers were unhappy with this limited action. In Glasgow, for example, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers broke with the policy of the Transport Workers' Federation and called its members out on strike on 7 May. On the same day, wage reductions were imposed on merchant seamen, leading to a well-supported general strike at the docks which lasted for over a month. Transport and rail leaders were widely criticised for their actions, with J. H. Thomas of the NUR and Robert Williams of the NTWF being singled out for particular criticism. For their part, union leaders pointed to the difficulties of resisting the wage reductions in a period which had a lot of unemployment, alleged that there was little support for sympathy action amongst rank-and-file dockers and railwaymen and argued that the involvement of other workers would only lead to needless sacrifices on their part.
