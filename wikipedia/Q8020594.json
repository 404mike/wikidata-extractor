In 1887, excavations at Amarna in Egypt uncovered the diplomatic correspondence of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and his son, Akhenaten. Two of the letters from a \"kingdom of Kheta\"\u2014apparently located in the same general region as the Mesopotamian references to \"land of Hatti\"\u2014were written in standard Akkadian cuneiform, but in an unknown language; although scholars could interpret its sounds, no one could understand it. Shortly after this, Sayce proposed that Hatti or Khatti in Anatolia was identical with the \"kingdom of Kheta\" mentioned in these Egyptian texts, as well as with the biblical Hittites. Others, such as Max M\u00fcller, agreed that Khatti was probably Kheta, but proposed connecting it with Biblical Kittim rather than with the Biblical Hittites. Sayce's identification came to be widely accepted over the course of the early 20th century; and the name \"Hittite\" has become attached to the civilization uncovered at Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y."]}, {"page": "Archibald Sayce", "response": ["Sayce dreamed of finding a Hittite Rosetta Stone to help with his research.
