The group's best-known single is \"Roxanne, Roxanne,\" a widely acclaimed hip hop classic, which created a sensation on the hip hop scene soon after it was released and inspired a record-high of 25 answer records in a single year (Roxanne Wars), with estimates ultimately spawning over 100. The most notable remake was done by Marley Marl's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Roxanne Shant\u00e9, which led to hip hop's first rap beef. \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" was originally the B-side of the lesser-known single \"Hangin' Out\". Due to personal issues, Educated Rapper was absent for its second effort, Skeezer Pleezer (1986), which produced one notable track with the song \"Split Personality\". EMD was, however, on one album track, \"Pick Up the Pace\", also featured in the movie Krush Groove.\nIn 2008, \"Roxanne, Roxanne\" was ranked number 84 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lyricist Lounge", "response": ["| colspan=12|Educated Rapper, Da Bush Babees, Moptops, Doug E.
