Chant\u00e9 also mentioned that Aaliyah had been part of her life \"since I was 6.\" R&B singer and friend Brandy said about the late singer \"She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record companies did not believe in kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. When I met her I embraced her, I was so happy to meet her.\" Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to \"Are You That Somebody?\" convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Japanese pop singer Hikaru Utada has said several times that \"It was when I heard Aaliyah's Age Ain't Nothing but a Number that I got hooked on R&B.\", after which Utada released her debut album First Love with heavy R&B influences. In 2012, British singer-songwriter Katy B released the song Aaliyah as a tribute to Aaliyah's legacy and lasting impression on R&B music. The song first appeared on Katy B's Danger EP and featured Jessie Ware on guest vocals.

At the time, Billboard, declared that Lipa was \"leading the charge toward disco-influenced production\" a day after her retro and disco-influenced album Future Nostalgia was released on March 27, 2020. By mid 2020, multiple disco albums and songs had been released and cultural phenomena associated with 1970s disco, specifically roller skating and roller discos, experienced a resurgence in mainstream popularity across the Western world. The resurgence of roller skating has been powered by social media apps like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat which have seen an increase of roller skating-related content throughout 2020, partially the result of people seeking escapist hobbies during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Hobart, Australia, it was reported that the popularity of roller skating was at its highest since the 1980s. In early September 2020, South Korean boy band BTS debuted at number 1 in the US with their English\u2013language disco single \"Dynamite\" having sold 265,000 downloads in its first week in the US, marking the biggest pure sales week since Taylor Swift's \"Look What You Made Me Do\" (2017).
