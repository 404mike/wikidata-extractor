The production was conducted by Piero Bellugi, and an all-star cast featuring Mirella Freni, Rolando Panerai, Fiorenza Cossotto, Irene Companez, Leonardo Monreale, Franco Calabrese, and Luigi Alva in the title role. Because Handel operas were still in a relatively early stage of their return to the stage, musicians had not yet thought to ornament the da capo sections (repetition of the A section) of the arias and thus, they were not ornamented. A complete recording was made in 1979. A particularly highly acclaimed production, sung in English, was staged by the English National Opera in 1985, to mark the 300th anniversary of the composer's birth. Conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, it was directed by Nicholas Hytner, who also translated the libretto, and starred Ann Murray in the title role, with Valerie Masterson as Romilda, Christopher Robson as Arsamene, and Lesley Garrett as Atalanta.Evan Dickerson, \"Seen and Heard Opera Review\" on Seen and Heard International website, retrieved 2 October 2014 The production returned for a sixth revival to the London Coliseum in September 2014, starring Alice Coote as Xerxes.William Hartston, \"Handel's Xerxes by the English National Opera: Astonishing comedy, glorious fun\", Daily Express (London), 17 September 2014.
