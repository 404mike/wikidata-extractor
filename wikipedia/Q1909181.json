However, after a good start tragedy struck the club when popular defender Matt Gadsby collapsed and died on the pitch at Harrogate on 9 September 2006. The practical response in the days following Gadsby's death included fans voluntarily organising bucket collections at games across the country to donate to Gadsby's widow and daughter. These events culminated in a memorial match at the Marston Stadium featuring a Legends XI and a Gadsby Select XI, featuring players from Gadsby's previous clubs.  Hinckley players took a month away from football and spent the rest of the season playing catch up. When Hinckley returned to action the season was one of up and down, but held on to a play-off spot, eventually rallying on and off the field to secure fourth place in the league, reaching the play-off final, but missing out on promotion conceding a last minute penalty."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2006", "response": ["*Matt Gadsby, 27, British footballer (Hinckley United), ARVC."]}, {"page": "List of association footballers who died while playing", "response": ["|  Matt Gadsby"]}, {"page": "2001 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["Less than a minute into the first half of extra time, Butler's header from a Harper throw-in found the back of the Walsall net to put Reading 2\u20131 ahead.
