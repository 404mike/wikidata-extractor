As promoted primarily by Robert Hutchins and Mortimer Adler, a universal curriculum based upon the common and essential nature of all human beings is recommended.  This form of perennialism comprises the humanist and scientific traditions. Hutchins and Adler implemented these ideas with great success at the University of Chicago, where they still strongly influence the curriculum in the form of the undergraduate Common Core.  Other notable figures in the movement include Stringfellow Barr and Scott Buchanan (who together initiated the Great Books program at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland), Mark Van Doren, Alexander Meiklejohn, and Sir Richard Livingstone, an English classicist with an American following."]}, {"page": "Oxford Preservation Trust", "response": ["*Sir Richard Livingstone (1944\u201347)"]}, {"page": "Classical Association", "response": ["*Sir Richard Livingstone (1941\u20132)"]}, {"page": "Richard Winn Livingstone", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Livingstone"]}, {"page": "Sir Richard Winn Livingstone", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Livingstone"]}, {"page": "Chewton Glen", "response": ["In 2006, Chewton Glen was bought by the property magnate Ian Livingstone.
