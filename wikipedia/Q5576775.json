After leaving the Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, Holland Park, in 1981, he failed to qualify as a London bus driver and then worked as a bookmaker, a betting-shop manager, and a minicab driver until the 1990s, when he began to freelance as a writer for Sporting Life and applied to university to study psychology. Dropping out after a year, he began his full-time writing career at Car magazine in 1993, becoming features editor, then in September 1995 moved to Focus magazine as deputy editor then acting editor, before joining F1 Racing (now renamed GP Racing) magazine as editor in December 1996, remaining until September 2007. F1 Racing has been credited with transforming the coverage of Formula 1 in print, and became the world's best-selling Formula 1 magazine, selling 1.25 million copies worldwide during Bishop's tenure.In the wake of the 2007 Formula 1 espionage controversy, which resulted in the McLaren Formula 1 team being fined an unprecedented $100 million, Bishop was recruited by McLaren chairman Ron Dennis to become the company's communications director. He left McLaren in July 2017. He then took a sabbatical to write his first novel, The Boy Made the Difference (published in 2020), before returning to motorsport public relations work in 2018 as a member of the senior leadership team of W Series, the world\u2019s first single-seater motor racing championship for female drivers only. After the 2020 W Series season was cancelled owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was announced that eight races in the championship's 2021 season would take place in support of Formula 1 Grands Prix.On 10 December 2020 it was announced that Bishop had been recruited by the Aston Martin Formula 1 team to be its chief communications officer, starting in 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen Kovacevich", "response": ["From 1961 to 1967 Kovacevich was married to novelist and psychotherapist Bernardine Bishop n\u00e9e Wall, who died in 2013.
