After the war, he played for Leyton Orient, before injury again forced him out of the professional game. He spent time with Ashington, before making another comeback in May 1949, this time with Port Vale. He was in goal for the \"Valiants\" in one of the club's brightest periods, helping them to win the Third Division North title and to reach the FA Cup semi-finals in 1953\u201354. He won one cap for the England \"B\" team, and later went into management with non-league clubs Boston United, Poole Town and Sittingbourne.

Vale's hard-working defensive five-some of Ray King (goalkeeper), Tommy Cheadle, Reg Potts, Stan Turner, and Roy Sproson were hailed as 'the Iron Curtain' or 'the Steele Curtain' (in honour of their manager). They finished top of the table with 69 points, eleven clear of second-placed Barnsley. Their 26 league goals conceded in a 46-game season was a record. Just five of these were conceded at home, another Football League record. This was based upon 30 clean sheets, again a Football League record. They also recorded a club record low of three league defeats. They were undefeated at home all season, continuing a 42 match unbeaten run started on 8 November 1952, that would last until 18 September 1954. His team's achievements were built on a settled squad of nineteen players, twelve of which played regularly. However the greatest success came in the FA Cup, where they beat Darlington, Southport, Queens Park Rangers, First Division teams Cardiff City and Blackpool, and finally Leyton Orient to reach the semi-finals. There Vale lost 2\u20131 to West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park in highly controversial fashion, as the \"Baggies\" were awarded a penalty despite the foul having occurred outside the box, and Vale also had a goal disallowed for offside."]}, {"page": "Frank King (footballer)", "response": ["Frank King (13 March 1917 \u2013 c. 2003) was an English football goalkeeper who played for Blyth Spartans, Everton, and Derby County in the 1930s.

However, he was unable to trouble the club's firmly established number one, Ted Sagar, and was transferred to Derby. There he picked up an injury after a challenge from Stoke City's Freddie Steele. Further injury problems forced his retirement at age 22, at which point he joined the police force. He guested for Southport during World War II.

In the semi-final clash with West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park he was dispossessed for the \"Throstles\" equaliser and gave away the penalty for Albion's winning goal. Cheadle featured only 26 times in the Second Division in 1954\u201355. He played 19 games in 1955\u201356 and 14 games in 1956\u201357, as the club suffered relegation under new boss Norman Low.

However Vale were already heading out of the Second Division, and went on to finish in last place in 1956\u201357. Low announced a new youth policy at Vale Park, and promptly released Cyril Done (Winsford United); Ray King (sold to Boston United for \u00a32,500); Reg Potts and Stan Turner (Worcester City); Tommy Cheadle, Stan Smith, and Derek Mountford (Crewe Alexandra); Len Stephenson and Billy Spurdle (Oldham Athletic); and Harry Anders (Accrington Stanley)."]}, {"page": "List of Port Vale F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Most clean sheets in a season: 29, Ray King, 1953\u201354."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["The club started 1949\u201350 with 86 players, though only 27 of these were full-time professionals.

The defence of Ray King, Stan Turner, Reg Potts, Albert Mullard, Tommy Cheadle and Roy Sproson was key to the \"Valiants\" success, missing just ten games between them.
