In an essay printed in The Sacred Wood, T. S. Eliot attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his \"surface\", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by E. E. Stoll and M. C. Bradbrook, provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time."]}, {"page": "1935 in literature", "response": ["*M. C.

Gibbon's book, the first full-length study of the genre, was first published in 1968 and was substantially revised, to address a broader audience and to update its conclusions in relation to subsequent scholarship, in a second edition that was published in 1980; see Gibbons (1980, Preface). The genre had been described and defined in earlier, broader surveys; see, for example, M. C. Bradbrook's The Growth and Structure of Elizabethan Comedy (1955), chapter nine (1955, 138\u2013164). Its principal playwrights were Jonson himself, Thomas Middleton, and John Marston, though many others also contributed to its development, including Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, John Day, and John Webster.Gibbon (1980, 2, et passim). Once the companies of boy players\u2014the Children of Paul's and the Children of the Chapel\u2014had resumed public performances from 1600 onwards, most of their plays were city comedies.Gibbon (1980, 1). The closest that William Shakespeare's plays come to the genre is the slightly earlier The Merry Wives of Windsor (c. 1597), which is his only play set entirely in England; it avoids the caustic satire of city comedy, however, in preference for a more bourgeois mode (with its dual romantic plots governed by socio-economics not love or sex), while its setting, Windsor, is a town rather than a city.Orlin (2008, 160); see also, Howard (2001)."]}, {"page": "F.

This device usually involves the prodigal \"having to choose between a faithful wife and a wanton mistress, choosing wrongly at first and later being brought to repentance.\" In Bradbrook's account, the play belongs to a more general shift within English popular comedy away from adventure stories and towards a greater interest in those focused on love.Bradbrook (1955, 133\u2013137)."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 1990s", "response": ["* Professor M.
