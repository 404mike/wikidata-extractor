The first news stories about the drug appeared in 1994. The UCI gave the task of developing a test for EPO to Francesco Conconi, a professor at the University of Ferrara, Italy, and a member of the UCI Medical Commission. In June 1996, Conconi, seemingly unable to find a definite test for the substance, proposed to the UCI to introduce a test for an athlete's hematocrit level instead, which tested how many red cells were in a rider's blood. During the UCI's meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 January 1997, the procedure, labelled as a \"health test\", limiting the allowed hematocrit level to 50 per cent, was introduced. If a rider returned a value higher than 50 per cent, they were not allowed to compete for a two-week period. However, as cycling journalist Alasdair Fotheringham noted, \"the 50 per cent threshold became a target to aim for\" instead of a reliable deterrent to using EPO.", "In the direct aftermath of the Tour, there were many raids and searches of cycling teams and many riders questioned by police. Two meetings to discuss the issue of doping were held shortly after the Tour: the first, between the UCI, race organisers and teams, took place four days after the Tour ended in Paris; the second, on 11 August, was between the UCI and representatives of the riders. Neither meeting yielded results that had \"any long-term effect\". The riders voiced concern over the length of races and demanded changes to be made, while the question of a general amnesty for riders who took banned substances was also briefly discussed. In a press communiqu\u00e9 released on 13 August, the UCI claimed that \"it is difficult to do more than is already being done\" in response to doping and that the blood tests enforced in 1997 enabled the UCI \"to control the EPO problem\", a claim that Alasdair Fotheringham later described as bordering \"on the delusional\"."]}, {"page": "1990 Tour de France", "response": ["LeMond had won the Tour without taking a stage win.
