He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints from the likes of Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him.Howell, p. 52. He consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military.Howell, p. 55. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works as a means of generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective.Howell, pp. 55\u201356. Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation.Howell, p. 56. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust.Howell, p. 61. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.Cockburn, pp. 75\u201376."]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1947\u20131950", "response": ["|| Hon Sir Herbert Hudd  || LCL || Alexandra || 1912\u20131915, 1920\u20131938, 1941\u20131948", ": Alexandra LCL MHA Sir Herbert Hudd died on 30 April 1948.
