He had played only school and club cricket when he was selected to tour New Zealand in 1906-07 with an MCC team of amateur cricketers. \nA lower-order batsman and medium-paced bowler, he made his first-class debut in the tour match against Wellington on Christmas Day 1906. His form was modest until late in the tour, when in the two-day match against a Wairarapa XV he took 11 wickets. In the next first-class match, against Hawke's Bay, he made the top score of the match with 87 and took 3 for 44 and 2 for 28. He was selected to play in the two matches against New Zealand that followed immediately, but was not successful.After the tour Torrens continued to play club cricket in England, including two first-class matches for MCC and one for the Free Foresters. He never played county cricket.\nHe was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1915 and left for the front in May 1916.
