In 1925, in a landmark contribution to catalytic theory, Taylor suggested that a catalysed chemical reaction is not catalysed over the entire solid surface of the catalyst but only at certain 'active sites' or centres.\nHe also developed important methods for procuring heavy water during World War II and pioneered the use of stable isotopes in studying chemical reactions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Active site", "response": ["* Hugh Stott Taylor"]}, {"page": "Ira Remsen", "response": ["* 1951: Hugh Stott Taylor"]}, {"page": "George Kistiakowsky", "response": ["In 1926, Kistiakowsky traveled to the United States as an International Education Board fellow. Hugh Stott Taylor, another student of Bodenstein, accepted  Bodenstein's assessment of Kistiakowsky, and gave him a place at Princeton University. That year, Kistiakowsky married a Swedish Lutheran woman, Hildegard Moebius. In 1928, they had a daughter, Vera, who, in 1972 became the first woman appointed as a professor of physics at MIT.Vera Kistiakowsky Papers, MC 485, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Institute Archives and Special Collections, Cambridge, Massachusetts. When Kistiakowsky's two-year fellowship ran out in 1927, he received a Research Associate and DuPont Fellowship. On October 25, 1928, he became an associate professor at Princeton. Taylor and Kistiakowsky  published a series of papers together. Encouraged by Taylor, Kistiakowsky also published an American Chemical Society monograph on photochemical processes."]}, {"page": "Arne Tiselius", "response": ["Tiselius became a research assistant at Theodor Svedberg's laboratory in 1925 and obtained his doctoral degree in 1930 on the moving-boundary method of studying the electrophoresis of proteins. From then to 1935 he published a number of papers on diffusion and adsorption in naturally occurring base-exchanging zeolites, and these studies continued during a year's visit to Hugh Stott Taylor's laboratory in Princeton University with support of a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship. On his return to Uppsala he resumed his interest in proteins, and the application of physical methods to biochemical problems. This led to a much-improved method of electrophoretic analysis which he refined in subsequent years."]}, {"page": "List of Christians in science and technology", "response": ["*Hugh Stott Taylor (1910\u20131974): chemist who received Villanova University's \"Mendel Medal\" and was made a Knight Commander of the Papal Order of St. Gregory the Great."]}, {"page": "Paul Hugh Emmett", "response": ["Emmett's doctoral advisor, Arthur F.
