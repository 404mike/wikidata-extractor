Agnes Strickland (1848), 276 Retrieved 10 May 2007; Willson, 95; \"Her traditionally flaccid court image\u00a0...\" Barroll, 27; Croft, 55; \"Anne had proved to be both dull and indolent, though showing a certain tolerant amiability so long as her whims were satisfied. She was interested in little that was more serious than matters of dress.\" Akrigg, 21. However, 18th-century writers including Thomas Birch and William Guthrie considered her a woman of \"boundless intrigue\".William Guthrie, History of Scotland, vol. 10 (London, 1768), p. 6: Thomas Birch, Memoirs of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 1 (London, 1754), p. 242. Recent reappraisals acknowledge Anne's assertive independence and, in particular, her dynamic significance as a patron of the arts during the Jacobean age.\"She quickly moved vigorously into court politics, an aspect of her new life not foregrounded by her few biographers\u00a0... she soon became a political presence at the Scottish court.\" Barroll, 17; \"Though she has been accorded insufficient attention by historians, James' Queen, Anne of Denmark, was politically astute and active.\" Sharpe, 244; \"This new king's influence on the high culture of the Stuart period, although considerable in certain discrete areas, has been misunderstood in terms of innovations at the court itself\u00a0... during the first decade of his reign, these innovations were fundamentally shaped by James' much neglected queen consort, Anna of Denmark.\" Barroll, 1\u20132.", "In late 1594, she began a furious campaign for custody of Henry, recruiting a faction of supporters to her cause, including the chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane.Stewart, 140\u2013141; Williams suggests that Maitland was playing a double game: though he shared Anne's enmity towards Mar, he secretly urged James not to give way to her. Williams, 53\u201357. Nervous of the lengths to which Anne might go, James formally charged Mar in writing never to surrender Henry to anyone except on orders from his own mouth, \"because in the surety of my son consists my surety\", nor to yield Henry to the Queen even in the event of his own death.Stewart, 141; \"And in case God call me at any time see that neither for the Queen nor Estates, their pleasure, you deliver him till he be eighteen years of age, and that he command you himself.\" Williams, 55. Anne demanded the matter be referred to the Council, but James would not hear of it.Williams, 54. After public scenes in which James reduced her to rage and tears over the issue,In May 1595 Anne desperately pleaded with James to be allowed custody of Henry, complaining that \"it was an ill return to refuse her suit, founded on reason and nature, and to prefer giving the care of her babe to a subject who neither in rank nor deserving was the best his Majesty had.\" The King countered that \"though he doubted nothing of her good intentions yet if some faction got strong enough, she could not hinder his boy being used against him, as he himself had been against his unfortunate mother.\" Williams, 54, quoting from Thomas Birch, Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 1 (London, 1754), p. 243. Anne became so bitterly upset that in July 1595 she suffered a miscarriage.Williams, 56. Thereafter, she outwardly abandoned her campaign, but it was thought permanent damage had been done to the marriage. In August 1595, John Colville wrote: \"There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other.\"Stewart, 141. Despite these differences, Anne and James visited the Prince at Stirling in December 1595 and returned to Holyrood Palace to celebrate her 21st birthday.M. Giuseppi ed, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 88-9. They had six more children. Anne extended and rebuilt Dunfermline Palace, in 1601 preparing a lodging for her daughter Princess Elizabeth, but the princess remained at Linlithgow Palace on the king's orders.

By late 1617, Anne's bouts of illness had become debilitating; the letter writer John Chamberlain recorded: \"The Queen continues still ill disposed and though she would fain lay all her infirmities upon the gout yet most of her physicians fear a further inconvenience of an ill habit or disposition through her whole body.\"Thomas Birch, Court and Times of James I, vol. 1 (London, 1849), p. 42."]}, {"page": "Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury", "response": ["In 1597 he was made Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and in February 1598 dispatched on a mission to Henry IV of France, to prevent the impending alliance between that country and Spain.

Cecil and Herbert lodged at a house of the Duke of Montpensier in Paris, and subsequently travelled south to meet the French king at Angers in March.

His success there led him to join Cumberland's other ventures in 1591 and 1593. The voyage in 1592 however was the most spectacular and led to the capture of the rich carrack Madre de Deus. After this, in another venture Monson was taken prisoner by the Spaniards in a recaptured prize after an engagement off Berlengas Islands, and was for a time detained at Lisbon in captivity.
