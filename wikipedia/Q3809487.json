By far the most common form, or \"use\", found in Southern England was that of Sarum (Salisbury). However, there was no single book; the services that would be provided by the Book of Common Prayer were to be found in the Missal (the Eucharist), the Breviary (daily offices), Manual (the occasional services of baptism, marriage, burial etc.), and Pontifical (services appropriate to a bishop\u2014confirmation, ordination). The chant (plainsong, plainchant) for worship was contained in the Roman Gradual for the Mass, the Antiphonale for the offices, and the Processionale for the litanies. The Book of Common Prayer has never contained prescribed music or chant; however, John Merbecke produced his Booke of Common Praier noted in 1550, which set what would have been the proper of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Creed, etc.) in the new BCP to simple plainchant inspired by Sarum Use."]}, {"page": "November 21", "response": ["** William Byrd, John Merbecke and Thomas Tallis (Episcopal Church (USA))"]}, {"page": "William Byrd", "response": ["Byrd is honoured together with John Merbecke and Thomas Tallis with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the US Episcopal Church on 21 November."]}, {"page": "Thomas Tallis", "response": ["Tallis is honoured with a feast day, together with Byrd and the musician John Merbecke, on the liturgical calendar of the American Episcopal Church on 21 November."]}, {"page": "Stephen Gardiner", "response": ["Thus Gardiner and the archbishop maintained opposite sides of the king's church policy; and though Gardiner was encouraged by the king to put up articles against the archbishop for heresy, the archbishop could always rely on the king's protection in the end.

Naming conventions may vary according to the churchmanship of the place of worship; in churches that tend towards a low church or broad church style of worship, the terms Eucharist or Communion are common, while in high church worship, the more Catholic term Mass may be used. Musical pieces corresponding to the liturgical pattern of the Ordinary of the Mass (Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus & Benedictus, Agnus Dei) may be sung by the choir or congregation. Many English-language settings of the communion service have been written, such as those by Herbert Howells and Harold Darke; simpler settings suitable for  congregational singing are also used, such as the services by John Merbecke or Martin Shaw. In high church worship, Latin Mass settings are often preferred, such as those by William Byrd.", "The tradition of a robed choir of men and boys was virtually unknown in Anglican parish churches until the early 19th century. Around 1839, a choral revival took hold in England, partially fuelled by the Oxford Movement, which sought to revive Catholic liturgical practice in Anglican churches. Despite opposition from more Puritan-minded Anglicans, ancient practices such as intoning the versicles and responses and chanted Psalms were introduced. The 16th century setting by John Merbecke for the Communion Service was revived in the 1840s and was almost universally adopted in parish churches. Composers active around this time included Samuel Sebastian Wesley and Charles Villiers Stanford. A number of grandiose settings of the Anglican morning and evening canticles for choir and organ were composed in the late 19th and early 20th century, including settings by Thomas Attwood Walmisley, Charles Wood, Thomas Tertius Noble, Basil Harwood and George Dyson, works which remain part of the Anglican choral repertoire today."]}, {"page": "Sanctus", "response": ["The Sanctus appears thus in the 1549 Book of Common Prayer (and as set to music by John Merbecke in 1550):"]}, {"page": "List of Anglican church composers", "response": ["*John Merbecke"]}, {"page": "John Merbeck", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Merbecke"]}, {"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["*John Merbecke (also Marbeck) (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1585), produced the first musical setting for the English liturgy, publishing The Booke of Common Praier Noted, 1549; surviving works include a Missa Per arma iustitie; almost burnt as a heretic in 1543"]}, {"page": "Template talk:Anglican Communion", "response": ["*John Merbecke - Anglican who composed the liturgy in the Book of Common Prayer"]}, {"page": "List of English-language hymnals by denomination", "response": ["**The Book of Common Prayer Noted (1550) by John Merbecke"]}, {"page": "The Cardinall's Musick", "response": ["The Cardinall\u2019s Musick has produced over 25 CDs on the ASV/Gaudeamus label: they are now exclusive artists with Hyperion Records.
