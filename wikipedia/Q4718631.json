Delicate in health and with his mother dying while he was still young, he was home-schooled by his father in a conservative interpretation of Christianity as well as via the classics such as the Iliad.  The former put him off conventional religion for life, while the latter was a continual influence on his art. He showed artistic promise very early, learning sculpture from the age of 10 with William Behnes, starting to study devotedly the Elgin Marbles (later writing \"It was from them alone that I learned\") and then enrolling as a student at the Royal Academy at the age of 18. He first exhibited at the Academy in 1837.Lucie-Smith, Edward. (1972) Symbolist Art. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 47.
