She was a winner of the British Academy's Rose Mary Crawshay Prize in 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rose Mary Crawshay Prize", "response": ["|Madeline House"]}, {"page": "Letters of Charles Dickens", "response": ["In 1949 the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis set a new edition in motion, with a grant of \u00a36000 from the Pilgrim Trust and the Dickens scholar Humphry House in place as editor.  In 1955, with almost 10,000 letters transcribed, House died unexpectedly.  His widow Madeline House took over the project in collaboration with the critic Graham Hough, though Graham Storey soon took over Hough's role.  The first volume of the Pilgrim Trust Edition, as it was named, was eventually published by Oxford University Press under their Clarendon Press imprint in 1965, and 11 more volumes appeared periodically, the last one in 2002.  The editorial team changed over the years, with Madeline House, Graham Storey, Kathleen Tillotson, K. J. Fielding, Nina Burgis and Angus Easson all being named as editor at various points.  The British Academy took over the financing of the project, and from 1995 it was renamed the British Academy \u2013 Pilgrim Trust Edition.  An electronic version of the edition has been published by InteLex Past Masters.  The Pilgrim Edition includes some 14,000 letters addressed to 2,500 known correspondents and to more than 200 unnamed and unidentifiable ones.  Not all of the originals of these letters can be found; some are printed from short extracts in sale catalogues and similar sources, and some are only known from mentions of their existence in other letters.  Dickens's biographer Claire Tomalin reported that \"Each volume of this edition wins acclaim as it appears, and it is right that it should do so\"; one such critic thought that \"it brings Dickens so close you can almost smell the cigar smoke\".  Dissenting voices have been few, and though Joel J. Brattin noted that there were some errors and omissions of transcription he endorsed it as being in general extremely accurate, and thought the project as a whole \"of incomparable value\"."]}]}}
