Retrieved 23 August 2010. He returned to Manchester United in 1904, and as well as being named club captain, he was again the club's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 32 league appearances. The arrival of high-scoring Jack Picken in May 1905 meant Peddie was unable to repeat the feat for a third time in four seasons, although he still made an important contribution with 20 goals in all competitions as Manchester United finished in second place to win promotion back to the First Division for the first time since 1894. Peddie was also replaced as captain by Charlie Roberts prior to the 1905\u201306 season. Having played in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots international trial match twice while playing for Third Lanark and twice with Newcastle, he made his fifth appearance in the fixture as a Manchester United player in March 1906, but would never be selected for the Scottish national team. In January 1907, he returned to Scotland, signing for Heart of Midlothian in a triple transfer with Dick Wombwell and William Yates.

A defeat at Villa Park in the penultimate game of the season left United needing to beat third-place Sunderland and hope that Aston Villa failed to beat Liverpool. United were a goal down when Meredith provided Enoch West with a cross which West sent into the net for the equalising goal.
