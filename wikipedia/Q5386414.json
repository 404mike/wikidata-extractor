However many games were put on hold until May, due to the exceptionally disruptive winter weather. Hodgson also helped to set up a youth program, arranging visits to schools, trials, and the running of two junior sides. In March 1947 he signed centre-half Eric Eastwood from Manchester City for a four figure fee. Experimenting with the first eleven, from 10 March to 19 April the team went on a run of one victory in eight games. Promotion hopeless and re-election unlikely, the experiments proceeded into the postponed games in May, when three consecutive away 1\u20130 defeats were followed by high-scoring victories at home to Crystal Palace and Southend United. Also the experienced Jack Smith was brought in from Manchester United.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Eric Eastwood", "|\u2013||MF||||Eric Eastwood||1||0||1", "| March 1947 || DF ||  || Eric Eastwood || Manchester City || 'four-figure fee' || "]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Eric Eastwood"]}, {"page": "1948\u201349 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Over the Christmas period talk was dominated by 'The Wembley of the North', which had been projected as an 80,000 capacity stadium, now it was planned as a 40,000 capacity ground with room for future expansion. Finding just fifty members for the '100 club', the financing was helped by a \u00a38,000 grant from The Football Association. In January the club initiated a fire-sale of players: Bill Pointon went to Queens Park Rangers for a then-club record five-figure fee, whilst Harry Hubbick was sold to Rochdale for around \u00a31,000. Meanwhile, the club transfer listed Palk, Aveyard, and Eric Eastwood (who all lived outside North Staffordshire); whilst Hulligan returned from injury. A two-month run without a win followed, in which Hodgson again experimented with the first eleven. This run finally ended with a 1\u20130 win over Notts County on 9 April. Nine days later at Ashton Gate, keeper Harry Prince was given a chance in place of regular George Heppell, who embarrassed himself by attempting to punch a forty-yard punt from Stone, only to miss the ball entirely and thereby concede the equalizer. Later in the month, Hodgson signed George King from Hull City for a four-figure fee. King scored twice in his debut against Torquay United.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Eric Eastwood"]}, {"page": "1949\u201350 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On the financial side, a profit of \u00a310,671 was made, another record, this was due to the sale of Allen which gave them a transfer credit of \u00a315,000.

Trouble with the new ground continued, as the Regional Officer of the Ministry of Works refused to permit the transfer of the stand from the old to the new stadium, despite having approved similar procedures at Liverpool and Millwall. Chairman William Holdcroft felt this was unfair, and was supported by Stoke-on-Trent North MP Albert Davies. Despite this set-back the stadium was opened on 2 August in a ceremony attended by 12,000 rain-soaked people.", "| April 1950 || DF ||  || Eric Eastwood ||  || Released || "]}, {"page": "Eric Eastwood", "response": ["Eric Eastwood may refer to:", "* Eric Eastwood (footballer) (1916\u20131991), British footballer", "* Sir Eric Eastwood (engineer) (1910\u20131981), British engineer and Fellow of the Royal Society"]}]}}
