One concept was a project called Hellraiser: Hellfire, a pitch by Stephen Jones and Michael Marshall Smith in which Kirsty Cotton would face a plot by a cult to unleash the Leviathan and the Cenobites into the real world, with a climax involving a large Lament Configuration enclosing London. The pitch was rejected due to budgetary concerns after the film was opted to be released direct-to-video. Although Barker was briefly in negotiations to return as executive producer in 1999 he was ultimately dropped from the production due to creative disagreements with the studio, and was barred from the providing any sort of assistance on the film. Bob and Harvey Weinstein ultimately commissioned a script by Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson. After giving Derrickson $10,000 to direct a single scene from the film, they hired him as the director. Doug Bradley has since claimed that Boardman's and Derrickson's script was originally not intended as a Hellraiser sequel, and that it was rewritten to provide connections to the series."]}, {"page": "Jack Randall", "response": ["*Jack Randall, main character in Spares by Michael Marshall Smith"]}, {"page": "Steven Savile", "response": ["He has edited and co-edited numerous anthologies, including Redbrick Eden, which raised money for the homeless charity Shelter and the 2006 science fiction and fantasy anthology Elemental, a benefit anthology for children who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that includes work by Arthur C.
