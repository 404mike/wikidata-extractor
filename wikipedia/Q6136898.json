He contributed nearly 50 drawings of scenes from Bristol, England to the topographical collection of George Weare Braikenridge. The Braikenridge Collection makes Bristol's early 19th century appearance one of the best documented of any English city. Johnson was also a painter of poetic landscapes in oil.Johnson was born in 1803 at Downend near Bristol. His father was a publican. By 1819 he was producing drawings, and he exhibited a landscape at the Royal Academy in 1822. In Bristol he participated in the evening sketching meetings of the Bristol School, and in 1823 he collaborated with Francis Danby and Samuel Jackson in a lithography project.In 1824 Johnson was one of the organisers of the exhibition of local artists at the new Bristol Institution. However finding it difficult to sell his work he moved to London in 1825 - \"starved out\" of Bristol, according to John Eagles, a fellow member of the Bristol School. He exhibited landscapes at the Royal Academy again in 1825 and 1826.In 1826 he returned to Bristol and then moved to Bath, Somerset, where he became a teacher of drawing. However he continued to produce Bristol drawings for Braikenridge, including some very fine watercolours of church interiors in 1828. He died in Bath in 1834 after throwing himself from a window.The Braikenridge Collection is in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. The Tate Gallery has one of his romantic landscape oil paintings, The Tranquil Lake: Sunset Seen through a Ruined Abbey, which has been called one of the finest landscapes of the Bristol School", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Johnson", "response": ["James Johnson may refer to:", "*James Johnson (artist) (1803\u20131834), English artist", "*James Johnson (engraver) (1753\u20131811), Scottish publisher", "*Super Chikan (James Johnson, born 1951), American blues musician", "*James Johnson (author and priest) (1674\u20131740), English author and cleric", "*James Johnson (South African Navy officer) (1918\u20131990), Chief of the South African Navy", "*James Johnson (Virginia congressman) (died 1825), U.S. Congressman from Virginia", "*James Johnson (Kentucky politician) (1774\u20131826), U.S. Congressman from Kentucky", "*James Johnson (Georgia) (1811\u20131891), U.S. Congressman and governor of Georgia", "*James Johnson (British politician) (1908\u20131995), British Labour MP for Rugby, 1950\u20131959, and Hull West, 1964\u20131983", "*James Johnson (Manitoba politician) (1855\u20131929), politician in Manitoba, Canada", "*James Johnson (Delaware politician) or \"J.J.\" (born 1943), member of the Delaware House of Representatives", "*James Johnson (Canadian football) (born 1980), professional American football and Canadian football cornerback", "*James Johnson (basketball, born 1971), former head coach of the Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball team", "*James Johnson (basketball, born 1987), basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets", "*James Johnson (cricketer) (born 1998), English cricketer", "*James Johnson (running back) (born 1984), former running back for the Minnesota Vikings", "*James Johnson (baseball owner) (died 1967), co-owner of the Washington Senators of the American League", "*James Johnson (sprinter), American track and field sprinter", "*James Johnson (wrestler) (born 1954), American Olympic wrestler", "*James Johnson (Master of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge) (1640\u20131704), Master of Sidney Sussex 1688\u20131704", "*James Johnson (surgeon) (1777\u20131845), British surgeon, writer and editor", "*James Johnson (Assistant Bishop of Western Equatorial Africa) (1836\u20131917), Sierra Leone Creole Anglican bishop", "*James Johnson (bishop of Worcester) (1705\u20131774), English prelate, Bishop of Gloucester (1752\u201359) and Worcester (1759\u201374)", "*James Johnson (bishop of St Helena) (born 1926), English prelate, Bishop of St Helena (1985\u201391)", "*James Johnson (railway engineer), Locomotive Superintendent of the Great North of Scotland Railway, 1890\u20131894", "*President James Johnson (Metal Gear), the fictional 44th President of the United States in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty", "*James Johnson, sole survivor of the wreck of the Dunbar"]}, {"page": "Bristol School", "response": ["The school initially formed around Edward Bird some years before his death in 1819.
