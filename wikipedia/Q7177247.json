He was one of a number of siblings, one of his younger brothers being the athlete and strongman Pete Tancred. As a school boy, the javelin was his main event but he developed elbow trouble and was forced to abandon this event. His father, Adrian,UK ALL-TIME RANKINGS Top spot for Capes and Tancred, MEL WATMAN rates the top British shot and discus throwers of all time, according to championship and record performances  believed that this was not a barrier to athletics in another discipline and Bill took up the discus in which his father coached him. After the family moved to Ipswich from Felixstowe he would find roads with adjoining fields to throw into and would often lose the discus in long grass. His father would get him to read books on the subject as well, to hone the technique, a discipline not used widely in the 1950s. His father would also improvise with equipment if none were available. He joined Ipswich Harriers and trained at the Ipswich Town training ground. This gave him opportunities for competition within the county and also in the Eastern Counties framework."]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's discus throw", "response": ["| 25||align=left| Pete Tancred ||align=left| "]}, {"page": "List of people from Quetta", "response": ["* Pete Tancred, former athlete"]}, {"page": "Peter Tancred", "response": ["#REDIRECT Pete Tancred"]}]}}
