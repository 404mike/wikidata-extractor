He joined Crystal Palace in 1979, before moving on to Queens Park Rangers two years later. After a loan spell at Port Vale, he helped QPR to top the Second Division 1982\u201383. He signed with Fulham in 1984, before ending up at Leicester City a year later. In 1987, he was loaned out to AFC Bournemouth, before moving to Portugal to sign with Sporting Lisbon and later S.C.

In February, McGrath signed goalkeeper Mark Harrison and defender Lee Harwood from Southampton, as well as forward Tony Sealy on loan from Crystal Palace. He also placed fifteen players on the transfer list, after which the Vale went on a six-game unbeaten run. Harwood and Phil Sproson made a solid defensive pair, whilst young Mark Chamberlain (brother of Neville) was used in midfield. The end of their run was a 2\u20132 draw with league leaders Walsall.

Mansfield Town manager Stuart Boam was so enraged that the goal stood that he raced onto the pitch to verbally abuse the linesman. In March, Johnny Miller had to retire with a knee injury. On 20 March, Mark Harrison conceded 'a crazy goal' from Hull City left-back Dennis Booth at Boothferry Park, whose fifty yard free kick hit the back of the net after several bounces.
