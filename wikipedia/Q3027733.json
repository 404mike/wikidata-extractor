The tension between France and Madagascar had grown especially acute in the three years prior to Ranavalona's succession, with an intensification of attacks in the months prior to her coronation. In February 1883 the northwestern coast was bombarded, followed by the occupation of Mahajanga by the French in May, and bombardment and capture of Toamasina in June. Attacks along the northern coast were ongoing at the time Ranavalona III was crowned in the summer of 1883. Shortly after the French initiated this latest round of hostilities, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony decided to engage Lieutenant Colonel Digby Willoughby, a Briton who had gained combat experience in the Anglo-Zulu War (but without having been a member of the British armed forces), to oversee the nation's military affairs and train the queen's army to defend the island against the seemingly inevitable French invasion."]}, {"page": "Goring-on-Thames", "response": ["*Digby Willoughby (1845\u20131901), military mercenary, died in Goring."]}, {"page": "Digby Willoughby", "response": ["Digby Willoughby may refer to:", "*Digby Willoughby, 7th Baron Middleton (1769\u20131856)", "*Digby Willoughby (adventurer) (1845\u20131901), English mercenary", "*Digby Willoughby (bobsleigher), Lieutenant Colonel Digby Willoughby, (1934\u20132007) ", "*Michael Willoughby, 12th Baron Middleton, real name Digby Willoughby, (b. 1921)", "*Digby Willoughby (Conservative politician), Lord Mayor of Hull, and figure of the 1946 corruption scandal"]}]}}
