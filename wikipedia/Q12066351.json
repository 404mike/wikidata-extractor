He was governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay from 1757 to 1760, and afterwards sat in the House of Commons from 1767 to 1780. He travelled widely in the North American colonies prior to the American Revolutionary War, opposed Parliamentary attempts to tax the colonies, and was a minority advocate of colonial positions until the Revolution.\nClassically educated and well-connected to the colonial administration in London, Pownall first travelled to North America in 1753. He spent two years exploring the colonies before being appointed Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey in 1755. He became governor of Massachusetts in 1757 after helping engineer the recall of longtime Governor William Shirley.  His administration was dominated by the French and Indian War (called the \"Seven Years War\" in Europe) in which Pownall was instrumental in raising Massachusetts provincial militia for the war effort. He opposed military interference in colonial administration, including attempts to quarter British troops in private homes, and had a generally positive relationship with the colonial assembly.\nReturning to England in 1760, Pownall continued to be interested in colonial affairs, publishing widely read materials on conditions in the colonies, including several editions of The Administration of the Colonies.  As a Member of Parliament he regularly advocated for colonial positions, without much success, but supported the war effort once the Revolutionary War began.  In the early 19th century he became an early advocate of the reduction or removal of trade barriers, and the establishment of a solid relationship between Britain and the United States.  Several writers have proposed that Pownall was Junius, a pseudonymous writer of letters critical of British governmental practices.\nJohn Adams wrote, \"Pownall was the most constitutional and national Governor, in my opinion, who ever represented the crown in this province.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 25", "response": ["*1805 \u2013 Thomas Pownall, English politician, Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay (b. 1722)"]}, {"page": "Lincoln, England", "response": ["*Thomas Pownall (1722\u20131805) politician, Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay"]}, {"page": "1805", "response": ["* February 25 \u2013 Thomas Pownall, English colonial statesman (b. 1722)"]}, {"page": "Lincoln County, Maine", "response": ["Lincoln County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maine.

By the late 17th century, Europeans may have entered the area as a result of the establishment of the Dutch patroonship owned by Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, which extended west and east out of Albany and the fur trading community of Beverwyck. The southwestern corner of Pownal was part of the patroonship. Rensselaerswyck passed into English control in 1664. The first European settlers may have entered the area in the 1730s.Hayward's New England Gazetteer of 1839 Those settlers may have been Dutch or other Europeans who leased land within Rensselaerwyck.

The labourers soon discovered the entrance to the tomb within the mound, and a Welsh antiquarian named Edward Lhwyd, who was staying in the area, was alerted and took an interest in the monument. He wrote an account of the mound and its tomb, describing what he saw as its \"barbarous sculpture\" and noting that animal bones, beads, and pieces of glass had been found inside of it (modern archaeologists have speculated that these latter two were in fact the polished pottery beads that subsequently have been found at the site and that were a common feature of Neolithic tombs).O'Kelly (1982:24) Soon another antiquarian visitor, Sir Thomas Molyneaux, professor at the University of Dublin, also came to the site. He talked to Charles Campbell, who informed him that he had found the remains of two human corpses in the tomb, one (which was male) in one of the cisterns and another farther along the passageway, something that Lhwyd had not noted.O'Kelly (1982:27) Subsequently, Newgrange was visited by a number of antiquarians, who often performed their own measurements of the site and made their own observations, which often were published in various antiquarian journals; these included such figures as Sir William Wilde, Thomas Pownall, Thomas Wright, John O'Donovan, George Petrie, and James Ferguson.O'Kelly (1982:33\u201334)", "These antiquarians often concocted their own theories about the origins of Newgrange, many of which have since been proved incorrect.

Archaeologia Vol 2, pp. 236\u2013276  which numbers all the stones and also records some of the carvings on the stone and asserted that the mound originally had been taller and a lot of the stone on top of it had been removed, a theory that has been disproven by archaeological research.O'Kelly (1982:33) The majority of these antiquarians also refused to believe that it was ancient peoples native to Ireland who built the monument, with many believing that it had been built in the early medieval period by invading Vikings, whilst others speculated that it had been built by the ancient Egyptians, ancient Indians, or the Phoenicians.O'Kelly (1982:35)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Hutchinson (governor)", "response": ["When Governor Shirley's political opponents engineered his recall in 1756, Hutchinson sought and received the endorsement of the British military leader Lord Loudoun to succeed Shirley as governor. During this time Hutchinson was the leading politician in the province due to the age and infirmity of Lieutenant Governor Spencer Phips.Walmsley, p. 30 Hutchinson's application was unsuccessful, but he did receive an appointment as lieutenant governor in 1758, serving under Thomas Pownall. Hutchinson's relationship with Pownall was awkward, for Pownall was at the center of political activities that dislodged Governor Shirley, under whose patronage Hutchinson had risen in power and influence.  Pownall cultivated relations with the populist factions in the state and sought to remove the influence of Shirley supporters, sometimes asking Hutchinson to turn against people he (Hutchinson) had earlier supported.  This Hutchinson refused to do since he saw these actions as harming the province's stability and taking place at \"the caprice of the governor\".Bailyn, pp. 41\u201342  Pownall, whose mistrust of Hutchinson was reciprocated, requested to leave to return to England in late 1759. The political opposition of Shirley supporters and the death of some of his leading populist supporters may have contributed to this decision.Waters and Schutz, p. 557  He departed the province on 3 June 1760, leaving Hutchinson as acting governor.Bailyn, p. 44  Several months later Pownall's replacement, Francis Bernard, arrived to take the reins of power.Bailyn, p. 45", "Because of his central role as the main focal point for the opposition to the royal rule, Hutchinson's reputation in America was generally quite poor. He was often seen as a traitor to his native Massachusetts and the cause of freedom. John Adams was characteristically harsh in his assessment of him, calling him \"avaricious\" and describing him as a \"courtier\" who manipulated those at higher levels of power to achieve his aims.Bailyn, p. 2  He was also criticized by British political figures: Thomas Pownall continued to disagree with Hutchinson after the latter's exile, Francis Bernard (despite working on Hutchinson's behalf) disapproved of some of his actions, and Lord North believed the publication of his letters to be responsible for the outbreak of the war.Bailyn, p. 3"]}, {"page": "William Shirley", "response": ["During the winter of 1755\u201356 Shirley's feud with Johnson continued.  Johnson, who was being advised by Thomas Pownall, continued to assert his exclusive authority over interactions with Indians, and renewed complaints about Shirley's interference in recruiting for the 1755 campaign.  In one letter Johnson wrote that Shirley had \"become my inveterate enemy\" who would do everything he could \"to blast if he can my character.\"Schutz (1961), p. 217  Johnson made common cause with the DeLanceys (to whom he was related by marriage) in their dislike of Shirley.Jennings, p. 162Schutz (1961), p. 218  They all fed unflattering reports to the new New York governor, Sir Charles Hardy, who forwarded them on to London.  Shirley was unaware of this looming threat to his authority.Schutz (1961), p. 221", "As commander-in-chief, Shirley made a grandiose proposal for the 1756 campaign season in November 1755, continuing the routes of attack begun in 1755 and adding an expedition to Quebec via the Kennebec River.Schutz (1961), pp. 221\u2013222  However, the complaints against him had reached the Duke of Newcastle, who felt he needed someone less embroiled in controversies with other leaders in charge of military matters in North America.Schutz 1961), pp. 225\u2013227  British leaders had also received intercepted letters destined for France that some believed might have been written by Shirley, in part because he married a Frenchwoman.  Thomas Pownall traveled to London in early 1756 and further denounced Shirley to the colonial administration.  Shirley did not learn of these matters until April 1756, by which time the British leadership had already decided to replace him as commander-in-chief.Schutz (1961), pp. 232\u2013234", "Although Shirley had been removed as commander-in-chief, he retained the Massachusetts governorship. He expected to lose even that post not long after his return to Boston in August.  However, no replacement had yet been named, and Loudoun saw either Shirley's interference or ineffectiveness in all that was wrong on the New York frontier.  He also raised detailed questions about Shirley's war-related expenditures, which he (and later historians) concluded was poorly-disguised patronage spending.Jennings, p. 287Schutz (1961), p. 240  Loudoun and Shirley argued over many issues, including Shirley's continuance of military preparations after January 1756, when Loudoun's commission was issued.  Shirley pointed out that British leadership could hardly expect preparations to cease in the interval between Loudoun's commission and his arrival to take command.  While he waited for a replacement to be announced, Shirley took depositions, gathered evidence to support his version of affairs, and worked to close his financial affairs down.Schutz (1961), p. 241  (Loudoun was of the opinion that Shirley delayed his departure intentionally as a political maneuver.)Jennings, p. 288  He sailed for England in October 1756.Schutz (1961), p. 242  Shirley would be formally replaced by Thomas Pownall in 1757.Schutz (1961), p. 245"]}, {"page": "Boston Port Act", "response": ["Even some of the strongest allies of America in Parliament at first approved the Act as moderate and reasonable and argued that the town could end the punishment at any time by paying for the merchandise destroyed in the riot and allowing law and order to have their course. However, the Whig opposition soon collected itself, and the bill was fought in its various stages by Edmund Burke, Isaac Barr\u00e9, Thomas Pownall and others. In spite of them, the Act became a law on March 31, without a division in the Commons and by a unanimous vote in the Lords."]}, {"page": "Waldo Patent", "response": ["In 1759, Waldo accompanied the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Thomas Pownall, and his 400 men to help establish this site. To open the Penobscot River area to settlement, the governor selected Fort Point in Stockton Springs to build a breastwork and blockhouse. Called Fort Pownall, the fort included a trading post. But Waldo died on May 23 near present-day Bangor while exploring the northern reaches of his property. He was buried without monument at Fort Point. Ownership of the Waldo Patent then transferred to his heirs, who included the Fluckers of Boston.  Lucy Flucker married Henry Knox, who served as a general in the American Revolutionary War, and the Knoxes eventually acquired most of the patent.  Much of their land was eventually sold to William Bingham, leading those lands to become known as the Bingham Purchase."]}, {"page": "Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet", "response": ["Bernard became an advisor to the North administration on matters concerning the colonies.  He generally took a harder line than his predecessor Thomas Pownall, who advocated for colonial interests in Parliament.  Proposals he made in 1771 included ideas central to the 1774 Massachusetts Government Act, which severely constrained colonial political power, including a council appointed by the governor rather than one elected by the assembly.  Bernard may also have played a role in the difficulties Benjamin Franklin had in being recognized as a colonial agent; after Franklin's credentials were refused by the colonial secretary, he encountered Bernard in an antechamber.Nicolson (2000), p. 214  Biographer Colin Nicolson observes that Bernard's presence as an advisor to the ministry \"cast a shadow on virtually every American measure regarding Massachusetts that [Lord Frederick] North pursued between 1770 and 1774,\" because of Bernard's role in breaking trust between the colonists and the London government and the subsequent radicalization of Massachusetts politics.Nicolson (2000), p. 215", "In 1774, when the North government was considering how to respond to the Boston Tea Party, Bernard published Select Letters on Trade and Government, containing proposals on how to deal with the ongoing difficulties in the colonies. He proposed to reconcile the constitutional grievances of the British and radical Americans by the possible introduction of American representatives into the Parliament of Great Britain.  In the Select Letters, which included the essay Principles of Law and Polity which he drafted in 1764, he laid out a point-by-point exposition of his viewpoints concerning imperial governance.  Some of his ideas were enacted, notably those enshrined in the Massachusetts Government Act; the outrage in London even sparked the sympathetic colonial advocate Thomas Pownall to propose the closure of Boston's port, which was enacted in the Boston Port Act.Nicolson (2000), p. 221\u2013223"]}]}}
