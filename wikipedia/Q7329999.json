He averaged barely 11 in his career, though his obituary in Wisden suggested that he had played \"some useful innings\".Williams' career began very badly. In his first game, against Derbyshire, he made 4 and 2* in 1923.\nHe did not appear again until 1925, when in his first nine innings of the season he made just 13 runs.\nHe brought this dreadful sequence to a close with 23 against Sussex in early June, then followed it up with the first of just three half-centuries: 56 versus Nottinghamshire.This innings was a false dawn, however, and in Williams' next 30 innings he never made more than 41.\nBy now it was August 1926, but then \u2014 admittedly after the match was dead\n\u2014 he produced what was to be his career-best innings: 81 against Nottinghamshire (again) at Trent Bridge.\nAnother lengthy run of failures followed, and although he made an unbeaten 76 against Yorkshire in early May 1928,\nhe was out of the side again by the start of June.\nWilliams was to make only three more first-class appearances: two in 1931 and one in 1932. His four innings produced scores of 2, 0, 0 and 1, bringing an unhappy end to his largely unsuccessful career in county cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Williams", "response": ["Richard Williams is the name of:", "* Richard Williams (animator) (1933\u20132019), Canadian-British animator", "* Richard Williams (theatre director), theatre director, producer and teacher", "* Richard Williams (Royal Marines officer) (1764\u20131839), British military officer", "* Richard Williams (RAAF officer) (1890\u20131980), Australian aviator", "* Richard Williams (conductor) (1923\u20132007), Welsh conductor", "* Richard Williams (musician) (1931\u20131985), American jazz trumpeter", "* Richard Williams, drummer for The Passions", "* Richard Williams (alias Cromwell) (by 1502\u20131545), Welsh soldier and courtier", "* Richard Williams (congressman) (1836\u20131914), American politician from Oregon", "* Richard Williams (died 1579) (before 1535\u20131579), English politician for Oxford", "* Richard Williams (died 1601) (before 1560\u20131601), MP for New Romney", "* Richard Williams (died 1692) (c. 1654\u20131692), MP for Radnorshire, for Breconshire and for New Radnor Boroughs", "* Richard Williams (MP for Flint) (c. 1699\u20131759), Welsh politician for Flint", "* Richard Williams (of Rhosygeido) (before 1570\u20131622), Welsh politician from Anglesey", "* Richard Williams (basketball coach), American basketball coach at Mississippi State University from 1986 to 1998", "* Richard Williams (cricketer, born 1901) (1901\u20131982), English, played for Worcestershire", "* Richard Williams (cricketer, born 1957), Welsh-born, played for Northamptonshire", "* Richard Williams (cricketer, born 1969), English, played for Gloucestershire", "* Richard Williams (American football) (born 1960), American running back for Atlanta Falcons and Houston Oilers", "* Richard Williams (Australian rules footballer) (1905\u20131958)", "* Richard Williams (English footballer) (1869\u2013after 1895), English, played for Everton and Luton Town", "* Richard Williams (rugby league) (born 1986), Australian rugby league footballer", "* Richard Williams (tennis coach) (born 1942), American coach and father of Venus and Serena Williams", "* Richard Williams (boxer) (born 1971), English boxer", "* Richard Williams (racing driver) (born 1977), English racing driver", "* Richard Williams (rock climber), American climber and entrepreneur", "* Richard Williams (academic) (born 1960), English academic and engineer", "* Richard Williams (journalist) (born 1947), English journalist"]}, {"page": "Richard Williams (Worcestershire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Williams (cricketer, born 1901)"]}]}}
