During the war he guested as a player for Arsenal, playing over 100 wartime matches, and after peace broke out, he signed as a permanent player in April 1919, as Arsenal were promoted back into the Football League First Division. He made his league debut against Sunderland at Roker Park on 13 September 1919 and became Arsenal's regular left back during the 1919-20 season, taking over from Frank Bradshaw who had moved up front to become an inside forward.\nHutchins was a first-team stalwart for 1920-21 and 1921-22, missing only three and five games in each season respectively. However, he only played ten games in 1922-23 before being dropped for Andy Kennedy. Unable to regain his place, Hutchins moved to Charlton Athletic in July 1923. In total he played 108 games for Arsenal, scoring one goal.\nHe spent three seasons with Charlton, of the Third Division South, before retiring in 1926. He died in 1948, aged 57.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy Kennedy (footballer, born 1897)", "response": ["Soon after joining Arsenal, Kennedy stepped up to the first team after Arthur Hutchins was dropped, and made his debut against Birmingham on December 2, 1922.
