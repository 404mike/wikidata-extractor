Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Dundee United had also made inquiries about signing Kelly, although Inverness were only interested in loan terms. Kelly instead signed for Conference Premier club York City on 29 August on a two-year contract for an undisclosed five-figure fee, with family reasons being his motivation for moving to a British club. A day after signing for the club, he made his debut against Rushden & Diamonds and scored a late own goal, meaning his new team lost 3\u20132. He was ruled out for at least a month with a suspected torn hamstring in January 2008, which was picked up in training, and returned to the team in their 2\u20130 defeat against Cambridge United on 1 March 2008, after coming on as a 53rd-minute substitute for Darren Craddock. He finished the 2007\u201308 season with 33 appearances and 2 goals for York. Kelly drew praise from York manager Colin Walker following York's 2\u20130 victory against Woking in October, which was his first start of the 2008\u201309 season. Following this, he admitted fears over his future at York after struggling to feature in the team, having only made two starts since April.

Robson made a run in the 52nd minute and despite beating McGovern, struck his shot high over the bar as the second half became a more evenly matched contest.  Darren Craddock then came on in the 61st minute to replace Michael Barron for Hartlepool and nine minutes later, Porter pulled up with an injury and was replaced by Jon Daly.  Within a minute, the substitute had scored to put Hartlepool into the lead with a header from Strachan's free-kick.  On 75 minutes, Sheffield Wednesday made a triple-substitution with Pat Collins, MacLean and Drew Talbot coming on for Alex Bruce, Quinn and Peacock.  Talbot's first attempt on goal was a bicycle kick.  In the 81st minute, he was then brought down in the penalty area by Westwood which the referee adjudged to have been a foul:  he awarded a penalty to Sheffield Wednesday and sent off Westwood.  MacLean took the spot kick which Konstantopoulos was unable to keep out.
