South African motorcycle designer Pierre Terblanche and Tamburini were working side by side at the Cagiva Research Center (CRC) on new designs, Tamburini on the 916 and Terblanche on the Ducati Supermono. Terblanche's Supermono, which shared several visual cues with the Tamburini's 916, was shown to the public before the 916, leaving the impression that Tamburini was influenced by Terblanche. In fact, the influence was the other way around, with Terblanche incorporating ideas that Tamburini shared with him in the design studio from his 916 design. Journalist Kevin Ash said that the roots of the 916's styling were found elsewhere, outside Ducati and CRC. Ash said that the timing of the public debut of Honda's advanced oval-piston, 32-valve V4 engine Grand Prix racing bike, the NR750, in August 1991, indicates that NR750 influenced the final shape of the 916, though Tamburini, Terblanche and others at Ducati would not confirm this, Tamburini only saying that he was influenced by \"existing designs.\" Ash said that Tamburini showed a better understanding of visual weight than the NR750's designers, and the 916 design, \"moved it forward, personalized, and Ducati-fied it, in particular the blend of sharp edges and sweeping curves, which, like most innovation, broke existing rules.\""]}, {"page": "Suzuki V-Strom 650", "response": ["At the DL650's launch, Kevin Ash said \"taking everything into account - price, comfort, fuel range, general ability, you could argue it was the bike of the year,\" adding, \"there's something honest and solid about the V-Strom.\"  Having ridden a DL650 as his daily rider, in 2005 Ash called it the \"best bike you can buy.\" Ash complimented the bike's comfort, fuel range, engine and handling, faulting its brakes and corrosion resistance, and described the bike as \"perhaps the ultimate all-round machine.\"  At the launch of the revised 2012 model, Ash said that the previous generation, which could be very vulnerable to corrosion, had \"been left behind, especially by direct rival, the Kawasaki Versys.\"  After the release of the 2012 model, Ash placed the Vstrom ahead of the Versys."]}, {"page": "Miguel Angel Galluzzi", "response": ["Galluzzi said he is, \"looking for the next form of mobility,\" five to fifteen years into the future, and he will be, \"hiring young and creative and crazy people,\" at the new design center to do, \"experiments that might offer a rethinking or a melding of recent mobility concepts\". Piaggio and Galluzzi hope to bring a more cosmopolitan perspective than is possible working only in Italy, and branch out to such areas as electric vehicles that combine aspects of a motorcycle and a car, like the Renault Twizy and Audi Urban Concept.

The Hyosung GT250, rebadged as the ATK GT250 for 2011, is also a potential competitor in those markets, although it fares poorly in comparison. In India, the Ninja 250R and Hero Honda Karizma R are the leading competition. Though lower in peak power and with a slower top speed than the Ninja 250, the CBR was lauded for having more torque available at lower engine speeds, meaning that it was easier to accelerate from low speed and pulling away required less noise and drama, since the Ninja had to be revved to 9,000\u00a0rpm and above to make use of its greater power. This made the CBR250R more pleasant and forgiving to ride than the sportier, but more challenging, Ninja. Complaints from The Economic Times of Mumbai included a tendency to stand up if the rider makes a sloppy mid-corner correction, and brakes and suspension not up to the standards of a track bike. The Indian reviewer also perceived the  wet weight as \"not so light\", while American journalists considered it a featherweight, \"incredibly agile, flickable ... almost too light,\" at  lighter than the Ninja 250R. The Ninja 250R's brakes had a better, more linear feel with stronger initial bite and could stop from  in , while the CBR250R, with a stopping distance of , was lauded for its combined anti-lock brake option, a boon to beginners in spite of the slightly shorter braking distance achievable on the Ninja 250R by a skilled sport rider. Kevin Ash, at , found the dimensions comfortable for someone of his height, while David Booth cautioned it could be cramped for taller riders."]}, {"page": "Dual ignition", "response": ["Dual ignition promotes engine efficiency by initiating twin flame fronts, giving faster and more complete burning and thereby increasing power. Although a dual ignition system is a method of achieving optimum combustion and better fuel consumption, it remains rare in cars and motorcycles because of difficulties in siting the second plug within the cylinder head (thus, many dual ignition systems found on production automobiles typically were of a two valve design rather than a four valve). The Nash Ambassador for 1932-1948 used twin sparkplugs on the straight eight engine, while later Alfa Romeo Twin Spark cars use dual ignition, as do Honda cars with the i-DSI series engines, and Chrysler's Modern Hemi engine. In 1980 Nissan installed twin sparkplugs on the Nissan NAPS-Z engine, with Ford introducing it on the 1989 Ford Ranger and 1991 Ford Mustang four-cylinder models. Several modern Mercedes-Benz engines also have two spark plugs per cylinder, such as the M112 and M113 engines. Some motorcycles, such as the Honda VT500 and the Ducati Multistrada, also have dual ignition. The 2012 Ducati Multistrada was upgraded with \"twin-plug cylinder heads for smoother, more efficient combustion\", the change contributing to a 5% increase in torque and a 10% improvement in fuel consumption.Kevin Ash in Daily Telegraph, page M18, \"Motoring Section\", Saturday 29 September 2012 Early BMW R1100S bikes had a single spark plug per cylinder, but after 2003 they were upgraded to dual ignition to meet emission law requirements."]}]}}
