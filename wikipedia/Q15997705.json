He was born and died at Groby, Leicestershire. He was the uncle of later Leicestershire cricketer Terry Spencer.\nSmith was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. Early in his career he was considered promising as a batsman and scarcely bowled, but his batting did not develop and although he often made runs he was largely \"a useful hitter\". Unusually for the fast bowlers of his period, he was a good fielder, taking 257 catches in his 341 first-class games.", "link_mentions": {}}}
