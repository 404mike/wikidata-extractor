He was born and died at Groby, Leicestershire. He was the uncle of later Leicestershire cricketer Terry Spencer.\nSmith was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. Early in his career he was considered promising as a batsman and scarcely bowled, but his batting did not develop and although he often made runs he was largely \"a useful hitter\". Unusually for the fast bowlers of his period, he was a good fielder, taking 257 catches in his 341 first-class games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|Haydon Smith || 1,076"]}, {"page": "Haydon", "response": ["*Haydon Smith (1901\u20131948), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Smith", "response": ["*Haydon Smith (1901\u20131948), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Terry Spencer", "response": ["Charles Terence Spencer (18 August 1931 \u2013 2 February 2020) was an English first-class cricketer who played for Leicestershire. Only Ewart Astill and George Geary have taken more wickets for Leicestershire. His career best figures of 9-63 were made in 1954 against Yorkshire. He is the nephew of Leicestershire fast bowler Haydon Smith."]}, {"page": "John Bass (cricketer)", "response": ["Bass made two first-class appearances for Northamptonshire in the 1935 County Championship against Leicestershire and Sussex.  In the match against Leicestershire, Bass scored 5 runs in Northamptonshire's first-innings, before becoming one of eight victims for Haydon Smith.  In their second-innings, he scored 16 runs before becoming one of seven victims for George Geary.  He also bowled thirteen wicketless overs in this match.  In the match against Sussex at Horsham, Bass scored 12 runs in Northamptonshire's first-innings, before being dismissed by Alan Melville, while in their second-innings the same bowler dismissed him for 10 runs."]}, {"page": "Horace Snary", "response": ["In 1924, Leicestershire, to that point one of the weaker first-class counties, decided that a more professional approach was needed for success; the club appointed its first-ever professional coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and entered a second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship for the first time. Snary, Haydon Smith and Norman Armstrong were among players who later became prominent who were brought on through this system and in the team's first season in the Minor Counties Snary took 38 wickets at a cost of less than 12 runs per wicket, including a return of five wickets for six runs against Buckinghamshire. He made one first-team appearance in 1924 and three in 1925 \u2013 finally taking a first-class wicket \u2013 and then came into the team regularly in the second half of the 1926 season. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he was \"able to keep an excellent length and make the ball go away\" and that he \"required careful watching\"."]}, {"page": "James Sperry", "response": ["The Leicestershire club that Sperry returned to in 1946 after the Second World War was a rather different side from that of 1939: other seam bowlers such as William Flamson and Haydon Smith were either dead or retired, and the attack centred on the spin bowling of Jack Walsh and Vic Jackson. Sperry played regularly in the first six post-war seasons as often the only regular seam bowler, sometimes having Jackson's off-breaks as the other opening bowler. His best return was in the 1948 season, when he took 81 wickets in all matches at an average of 23.55; his average was better in 1951, when his 62 wickets cost just 22.70, but in some other seasons he averaged more than 33 runs per wicket, high for a regular bowler in the period in which he played. He retired at the age of 41 after the 1951 season but returned for two games in 1952 when he was granted a benefit match by Leicestershire."]}, {"page": "Gustavus Fowke", "response": ["Fowke was one of those over-40s, but was in fact only at the start of his cricket career, and he remained as Leicestershire's captain for the next five seasons, overseeing a transition in the team that saw the retirement of older players such as John King, Samuel Coe and Arthur Mounteney and the introduction of the nucleus of the team of the 1930s with Les Berry, Norman Armstrong, Haydon Smith and Alan Shipman. His own performances did not equal those of 1922, but nor did they fall much short: he made at least 500 runs in each season and his season average only once dipped below 15 runs per innings. His only century for Leicestershire was an innings of 104 in the match against Northamptonshire in 1923. In that match and in others until the emergence of Eddie Dawson, Berry and Shipman as regular opening batsmen, Fowke opened the innings, but later he dropped down the batting order to No 6 or No 7, and sometimes even lower. He missed a few matches in 1926 through a leg strain, but otherwise maintained fitness through to the end of the 1927 season, when he played in 29 first-class matches, more than in any other season, and then retired."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Among their better players were the wicket-keepers Tom Sidwell and Percy Corrall; batsmen Norman Armstrong, Les Berry and Eddie Dawson; and bowlers Ewart Astill, George Geary and Haydon Smith."]}]}}
