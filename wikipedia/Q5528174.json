He had already met Altolaguirre and Concha M\u00e9ndez in London.  They enjoyed some kind of intense but short-lived relationship, commemorated in a poem dated 20\u201322 March 1935 and included in Invocaciones, before Richardson returned home.Taravillo A\u00f1os espa\u00f1oles p 315  In February 1938,Stanley Richardson and Spain Richardson arranged for him to give a series of lectures in Oxford and Cambridge.  At the time, Cernuda thought that he would be away from Spain for one or two months, however this was to be the start of an exile that would last for the rest of his life.  The lectures never took place.  Richardson was well-connected, however, and arranged a party for him, attended by celebrities such as the Duchess of Atholl, Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon, the Chinese ambassador, Rebecca West and Rose Macaulay.  Even by then, the situation in Spain meant that it was not advisable for Cernuda to return and so Richardson suggested that he should join a colony of evacuated Basque children at Eaton Hastings on Faringdon's estate.Murphy: Pub Poets"]}, {"page": "Alexander Henderson", "response": ["* Alexander Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon (1902\u20131977), British Labour politician"]}, {"page": "List of McGill University people", "response": ["* Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon (BA 1922) \u2013 former member of the London County Council, Chairman of the Fabian Society, 1960\u20131961"]}]}}
