The programme, initially shown on BBC Three before moving to BBC Two since 2007, focuses on interviews between the host and panel of guests, with a prominent candidate from the latest episode of the main programme that had been broadcast, often mixing general discussion, expert opinion and interviews, with highlight clips (unedited and edited) and small sketches designed for comedic effect.

In addition to this, the show announced an amendment to the host-panel format of the show; along with the news on 11 September 2015 that comedian Jack Dee would be the new host for the tenth series, it was also revealed that the show would feature only two guest panellists, with the third being filled by comedian Romesh Ranganathan, who acted as a regular, recurring panellist on each episode. Dee left after the tenth series had finished, due to work commitments he had made towards other comedies and a radio show, while Ranganathan was forced to drop out after his work schedule for the following year made it unlikely for him to appear in the next series. As a direct result the production team dropped the use of a regular panellist, returning to the original host-panel format, while also modifying the set - this included returning to the use of the original main stage layout, and removing the audience spaces that had been added in. In September 2016, the BBC unveiled comedian Rhod Gilbert, as the show's new host for the twelfth series; Gilbert left in 2019 and was replaced by Tom Allen.", "| 15 || 2 October 2019 || 18 December 2019 || rowspan=\"2\" |Tom Allen"]}, {"page": "Sensitive Skin (British TV series)", "response": ["*Tom Allen as Raphie (Episodes 4 and 6)"]}, {"page": "Adaptations of A Christmas Carol", "response": ["*In Bleak Expectations, a Dickensian pastiche comedy series, the protagonist Philip 'Pip' Bin (played by Tom Allen) unsuccessfully attempts to become a novelist to raise himself out of poverty, one of his rejects starting \"How Ebenezer Scrooge hated Harvest Festival\".
