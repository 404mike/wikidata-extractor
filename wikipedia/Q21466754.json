He was 'a trenchant defender of traditional painting', who fought against the dominant art school conventions of his day. Primarily a painter with a love of colour, Weinberger also taught art and illustrated books. He rarely painted people. Weinberger preferred to paint interiors and objects within them. He never dated his work (which has posed problems for curators, historians and those concerned with sales of his art). Harry Weinberger died at the age 85 on 10 September 2009.", "link_mentions": {}}}
