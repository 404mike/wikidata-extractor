He was 'a trenchant defender of traditional painting', who fought against the dominant art school conventions of his day. Primarily a painter with a love of colour, Weinberger also taught art and illustrated books. He rarely painted people. Weinberger preferred to paint interiors and objects within them. He never dated his work (which has posed problems for curators, historians and those concerned with sales of his art). Harry Weinberger died at the age 85 on 10 September 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Iris Murdoch", "response": ["* The Iris Murdoch Archive, Kingston University, London  accessed 2010-02-24.

Bloch also taught Koppel's cousin, the artist Harry Weinberger, who had fled to England from Czechoslovakia a year after Koppel. In addition, Koppel became interested in Freudian psychoanalysis, which is reflected in his work. Other influences included German Expressionism and Surrealism."]}]}}
