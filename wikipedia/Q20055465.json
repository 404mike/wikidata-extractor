The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generated significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38. As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. The parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.Stephen Constantine, The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940, London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183. This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, then Lord Passfield. Its initial annual budget of \u00a31 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the infrastructure of transport, electrical power and water supply in colonies and dominions abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade. The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies."]}, {"page": "Empire Marketing Board", "response": ["*'Buy and Build: The Advertising Posters of the Empire Marketing Board', Stephen Constantine, PRO, London."]}, {"page": "Stephen Constantine", "response": ["Stephen Constantine (born 16 October 1962) is an English professional football coach and former player."]}, {"page": "Stephen Tallents", "response": ["*Stephen Constantine, \u2018Tallents, Sir Stephen George (1884\u20131958)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, retrieved 4 June 2007"]}, {"page": "Historiography of the British Empire", "response": ["The studies of policy-making in London and the settlement colonies like Canada and Australia are now rare.

Firstly, they have suggested that the British empire was a cultural project as well as a set of political and economic relationships.
