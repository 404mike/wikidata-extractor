His version then entered the public domain. Perhaps he wrote the poem down from memory and reconstructed it in the process. He may not have consciously intended to improve on Twells' version.", "Pentreath's Amended VersionThe full version was quoted by Sir Peter Gadsden in his address at \"The Service of Thanksgiving for the Life of Guy Pentreath\" held in Westminster Abbey on 20 January 1986.
