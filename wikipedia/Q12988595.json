He was a slow bowler who played fourteen matches for Worcestershire in the 1920s, 11 in 1923 and 1924, then a gap before another three in 1928.\nGale's most successful match was his first-class debut in early May 1923, when he claimed 5-49 in the first innings against Warwickshire. He never again took more than two wickets in a first-class innings; indeed, this single innings performance garnered him as many wickets as the entire remainder of his Worcestershire career.\nAfter the end of his first-class career, Gale played minor counties cricket for Staffordshire in the 1930s, primarily as a top-order batsman.\nGale was born in Solihull; he died in Dudley at the age of 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norman Sharp", "response": ["Sharp made his only appearance in first-class cricket when he was selected to play for Warwickshire against Worcestershire in the County Championship at Edgbaston. He batted just once in the match, which Warwickshire won by 7 wickets, scoring 3 runs from the lower-order, before being dismissed bowled by Leslie Gale."]}]}}
