Fowler was criticised by Kettering's chairman, Imraan Ladak, for his bad attitude and alleged desire to leave the club. However, after featuring in his last game in the league on 24 November 2009, Fowler was brought on as a substitute in the club's crucial FA Cup second round replay against Leeds United at Elland Road.

Kettering went on to concede 4 goals in the next 14 minutes to lose the game 5\u20131. Deehan was sacked after the match by Ladak for using Fowler, claiming that he did not think his side would have conceded had Fowler not been in the team, and also that he was only on the bench to make up the numbers, and not to be brought on to the field.
