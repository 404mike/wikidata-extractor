Originally joining the band in 1975 with a new drum kit, haircut and scooter, he left the band temporarily during a period when the line-up was incomplete, and joined a mod trio called Relay, who played a number of school discos and pubs around Islington, London.\nIn 1977, following a Relay gig, Paul Cattini was spurred on to find a bass player and completed the line-up for The Fixations.\nAfter leaving the band, Gamby played the congas at the Green Street Green Baptist Church, and runs drum workshops for people with disabilities, working with organisations such as Mencap in Bromley, CASPA and Leonard Cheshire Disability.\nHe had a mention in the mod fanzine, Maximum Speed.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Fixations", "response": ["The Fixations were a mod revival band from North London that formed in 1978. An early incarnation of the band, including Ken Gamby (drums), Paul Cathcart (vocals, lead guitar), Paul Cattini (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Noel Hughes (bass) started in summer 1976. The line-up changed in 1978 with Richard Sharp joining the band on rhythm guitar. Later Cathcart switched to lead guitar and taught Richard bass guitar, and gigs were lined up by November 1978, making them one of the first bands in the mod revival scene, and gaining a very early mention in Sounds.", "Their management turned down a number of record deals, so no vinyl records exist by this band, despite recording a double A side (\"No Way Out\"/\"Clever Remarks\") with Larry Wallace for Carerre. Detour Records has released The Sound Of Young London, and a book has been written by their drummer called The Fixations Modest Recognition. Written by Ken Gamby and Paul Cattini, the book chronicles the history of the band."]}]}}
