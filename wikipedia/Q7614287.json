This resurgence was in part thanks to the goals of Steve White who emulated Dixie McNeil by being the leading goalscorer in the top four divisions. Hereford lost to Darlington in the play-offs and, with financial problems worsening, the club lost key players for the following 1996\u20131997 season. After a terrible run of form Hereford were ultimately relegated after a relegation-decider at Edgar Street with Brighton & Hove Albion."]}, {"page": "Paul Walsh", "response": ["Walsh was signed by Luton Town manager David Pleat for \u00a3400,000 plus Steve White in July 1982. Pleat had an attacking philosophy which gave Walsh the freedom to express himself and score goals. In only his second game for Luton at Kenilworth Road he scored a hat-trick in a 5\u20133 win over Notts County, the second goal of which was voted Goal of the Season as he beat numerous defenders before chipping the goalkeeper. On the final day of the 1982\u201383 season Luton needed to beat Manchester City at Maine Road to remain in the First Division, and a late Radomir Anti\u0107 volley secured the \"Hatters\" a 1\u20130 win and a place in the top-flight. After the game Pleat celebrated by running down the touchline in a scene that became an iconic moment of 1980s football in England."]}, {"page": "Steve Flack", "response": ["While playing for Cambridge, he attracted attention from several Football League clubs, including Cambridge United, Lincoln City and Barnet, before signing for Third Division side Cardiff City in November 1995 for \u00a310,000. Cambridge United had already agreed a deal with Flack over a transfer but a late bid from Cardiff convinced him to move to South Wales. Prior to turning professional, Flack had worked as a hod carrier and bricklayer on building sites, competed as a boxer and been a stand-up comedian. He made his professional debut for the club on 13 January 1996 in a 1\u20130 defeat to Northampton Town, before scoring his first goal during a 3\u20131 defeat to Wigan Athletic on 16 March 1996. He made ten appearances in his first season of professional football, five coming as a substitute, but the arrival of Steve White at the start of the 1996\u201397 season saw Flack struggle to break into the first-team."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 in English football", "response": ["Leading goalscorers: Steve White (Hereford United) - 30"]}]}}
