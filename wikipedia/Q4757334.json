According to Chambers and Partners Hopper is \"the oracle of all things relating to solicitors\u2019 disciplinary proceedings\".Hopper advised Andrew Crossley of ACS:Law who was referred to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal in relation to claims against people suspected of copyright infringement using peer-to-peer file sharing.He developed cancer in 2017 and died in July 2018 at the age of 69.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Solicitor advocate", "response": ["Whilst there has been a steady growth of numbers in recent years, the bulk of the serious advocacy is still undertaken by solicitor advocates with many years of advocacy practice behind them.

He also suggested the decision to prosecute and the level of the fine were reactions to Bindman's \"robust\" defence to the charges against him. Hopper sympathised with the view that Bindman was treated \"disproportionately because of his stature in the profession\"."]}, {"page": "Hopper (surname)", "response": ["*Andrew Hopper (1948\u20132018), British solicitor"]}, {"page": "Hopper, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Hopper"]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Andrew Hopper, 69, British lawyer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2018", "response": ["*Andrew Hopper, 69, British lawyer.Andrew Christopher Graham Hopper QC"]}]}}
