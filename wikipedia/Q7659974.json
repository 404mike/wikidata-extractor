He was born in Leytonstone, Essex, and educated at Redcliffe School and Colston School in Bristol.\nHis first job was with Western Daily Press and Allied Newspapers in Bristol started in 1905. This lasted until 1911 when he left to become a special writer on the staff of Edward Hulton and Co. in Manchester. He moved to London to work on the Daily Mail and Daily Citizen in Fleet Street, although he also worked in the propaganda section of Air Intelligence towards the end of the First World War. When it ended he joined the editorial staff of George Newnes Ltd as a sub editor of the John O'London's Weekly. He didn't see eye to eye with the editor and after a big row in 1919 his employment was terminated.\nHe decided to become a full-time writer. He became a popular author with the publication, in 1925, of his first crime novel, The Mystery of No.1, and with novels such as Checkmate (1930). Horler's work was influenced by other popular thriller writers such as Edgar Wallace and \"Sapper\". His main hero was \"Tiger\" Standish, a character similar to Sapper's Bulldog Drummond. Horler's work began to be commercially successful after being serialised in the News of the World. By the 1930s, Horler's books had sold an estimated two million copies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1925 in literature", "response": ["*Sydney Horler \u2013 The Ball of Fortune"]}, {"page": "1926 in literature", "response": ["*Sydney Horler \u2013 The House of Secrets"]}, {"page": "1928 in literature", "response": ["*Sydney Horler \u2013 The Curse of Doone"]}, {"page": "1930 in literature", "response": ["*Sydney Horler \u2013 Checkmate"]}, {"page": "Leytonstone", "response": ["*Sydney Horler (1888\u20131964), novelist"]}, {"page": "H.
