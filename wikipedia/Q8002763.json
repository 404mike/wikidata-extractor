The band signed to WEA Records, but were dropped without releasing the album they had recorded after Clive Black, who had signed the band, left the label. Harris and Rowe left soon after before Crewdson and Ryder Prangley recruited drummer Robin Guy and released several E.P.s through their own label 'Bitch Vinyl'. The band built up a considerable live following and received favourable coverage from magazines such as Kerrang!, Melody Maker and Metal Hammer. They appeared in the film 'G.M.T. Mean Time' produced by Taylor Hackford. Keyboard player Shaheena Dax joined the band in time to record Hymns For Strange Children, their first official album release. It was recorded in two weeks with John Fryer (HIM, Nine Inch Nails, White Zombie) as record producer, and upon its release went to the top of the NME's Independent Chart. Around this time the band headlined the 2000 capacity Astoria Theatre in London, England. The band next signed to Pure Stirling Records, who released their second album Oceans Of Venus in the UK. It was subsequently released in the US by Captiva Records, and in Germany through Sony Music.  The video for the single 'Black Cherry' was playlisted on music channel VH1. Robin Guy left the band before Rachel Stamp headed to the USA to play as part of the 'United II' tour featuring Pigface and Dope. Shortly after this the band became inactive for a few years despite never officially splitting up. In 2009 Guy returned to the group for a headling show at London's O2 Academy Islington to support their best of compilation album, Now I'm Nailed To Your Bedroom Wall, I've Only Got Myself To Blame.  This was followed by a short UK tour in late 2009.", "In 2010, Will Crewdson and David Ryder-Prangley played alongside Adam Ant on guitar and bass for performances around London.   Ant and former longtime collaborator Marco Pirroni had previously guested with Rachel Stamp at a 1997 gig at the original Camden Monarch. Crewdson later returned to Ant's band as joint guitarist in early 2014 (appearing on the concert DVD Dirk Live At The Apollo) and is still presently a member. He was sole guitarist for Ant following the sudden death of bandmate Tom Edwards during a US tour in January 2017 until the recruitment of replacement Adam Leach later that year. Crewdson has also worked with LIVAN, fronted by Greek-born musician Cosmas Livanos.Click on \"I\" for information and see bio at - ", "Will Crewdson and Sheheena Dax have also formed a band She Made Me Do It.
