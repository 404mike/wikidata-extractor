One theatre critic in their review described Burn's Queenie as, \"a dynamo dumpling with enough personality to light up a whole fleet of show boats\". When the show moved to the London Palladium in 1991, Burns won the Laurence Olivier Award, the United Kingdom's most prestigious prize for theatre, for her work in the show.

It was commissioned by the John S. Cohen Foundation. He had learnt of Kay's original work after he was shown a copy of the BBC video by poet and artistic director Maura Dooley. It was a difficult development with Turnage at one point abandoning the work in favour of other pieces. Composer and librettist had started out with the intention of developing a full-length opera including both soprano and baritone narrators.Nick Kimberley, \"Two from the Heart\", The Independent, Tuesday, 17 June 1997. Retrieved 11 December 2009. (The original television script had included poems for the judge as well as for the woman.) However, the creators felt that their attempts at redeveloping and expanding the original work \"water[ed] down its impact\" and they eventually cut everything apart from the woman's words. Both text and setting also underwent repeated changes in detail. Kay changed some of the wording to make it easier to sing. Similarly, Turnage revised the music after trying it out with Sally Burgess who was to give the first performance. He had become Composer in Association with English National Opera (ENO) in 1995 and was able to thoroughly workshop Twice and its companion piece with ENO's Contemporary Opera Studio before arriving at their respective final versions.Sue Knussen, \"Mark-Anthony Turnage: Defying the Stereotype\" in Philip Reed (ed.)

Three pages in publication without page numbering.", "Twice Through the Heart was first performed on 13 June 1997 at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall during the 50th Aldeburgh Festival. Sally Burgess was accompanied by the ENO Contemporary Opera Studio conducted by Nicholas Kok. The companion piece was the chamber opera The Country of the Blind which Turnage had composed relatively quickly in order to make up a full programme after Twice had turned out much shorter than originally intended. To Turnage's surprise, ENO decided to follow up the original four performances, split between Snape Maltings and the Queen Elizabeth Hall, with a staging at its main home in the London Coliseum.Duncan Hadfield, \"Classical & opera:Short but not sweet\", The Independent, Saturday, 18 October 1997.

For this critic, the instrumental writing came over far more successfully than the vocal part with Kimberley praising the use of colour and finding the \"draining\" final climax particularly effective. Michael Kennedy, in contrast to Kimberley, found the scena \"the more dramatic and musically more inventive\" of the two works performed that night.Michael Kennedy, \"Paler but still burning\", The Daily Telegraph, 28 June 1997.
