He is currently a member of Guidebooks, an experimental sample and song-based band, and a record producer. Pilot lives in Berlin.\nPilot is known for using unusual sounds and instruments alongside more traditional band arrangements.  This has been variously with found sound samples or instruments such as bowed saw or bass clarinet.  He was quoted as \"it's all about finding the unique creative voice of a songwriter, or a story and then finding the sounds and arrangement that match these moments\". Pilot has worked with bands such as Clare & the Reasons, The Black Atlantic, Beth Rowley, Rue Royale, and Tim Williams.\nAfter disbanding The Amazing Pilots in 2007, Pilot became in demand as a record producer.  Notably he has worked with Northern Ireland artist Duke Special, acting as co-producer for Songs from the Deep Forest and Oh Pioneer while acting as producer for I Never Thought This Day Would Come.Pilot wrote the score for Bidder 70, a documentary film that in 2012 won the Moving Mountains Prize at the Telluride Film Festival and was named Best American Film at the Traverse City Film Festival.

A piano-based songwriter with a romantic style and a warm, distinctly accented voice, he has distinctive long dreadlocks, eyeliner and outfits he describes as \"hobo chic\". His live performances have a theatrical style inspired by Vaudeville and music hall, and often incorporate 78s played on an old-fashioned gramophone, or sound effects from a transistor radio. He is most often accompanied by percussionist \"Temperance Society\" Chip Bailey, who plays cheese graters and egg whisks, a Stumpf fiddle and a Shruti box, as well as the more typical drums and cymbals.
