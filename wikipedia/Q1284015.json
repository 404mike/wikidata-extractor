His contributions to the fields of papyrology and Greek studies were many and substantial, and Eric Gardner Turner believed that Lobel should \"be acknowledged as a scholar to be mentioned in the same breath as Porson and Bentley, a towering genius of English scholarship.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sappho", "response": ["In 1652, the first English translation of a poem by Sappho was published, in John Hall's translation of On the Sublime. In 1681 Anne Le F\u00e8vre's French edition of Sappho made her work even more widely known. Theodor Bergk's 1854 edition became the standard edition of Sappho in the second half of the 19th century; in the first part of the 20th, the papyrus discoveries of new poems by Sappho led to editions and translations by Edwin Marion Cox and John Maxwell Edmonds, and culminated in the 1955 publication of Edgar Lobel's and Denys Page's Poetarum Lesbiorum Fragmenta."]}, {"page": "Corinna", "response": ["Since the early twentieth century, scholars have been divided over the accuracy of the traditional chronology of Corinna's life.  As early as 1930, Edgar Lobel argued that the language used in Corinna's surviving poetry seems to favour a later date than tradition suggests, and that there is no reason to believe that Corinna significantly predated the mid-fourth century BC, the point at which the orthography preserved in the Berlin Papyrus of Corinna's poetry began to be used.  More recently, M. L. West has argued for dating Corinna to the late third century BC, and W. J. Henderson supports a middle-ground, between West's very late and the traditional early date.  David A.  Campbell judges it \"almost certain\"  that her poetry belongs to the 3rd century BC.  Other scholars, such as Archibald Allen and Jiri Frel, argue for the accuracy of the traditional date, writing that a Hellenistic Corinna as argued for by West would be \"astonishing\".  An apparent terminus ante quem is established by the report in Tatian's Oration against the Greeks of a sculpture of Corinna by Silanion (fl. c.325 BC), though Tatian's report has been doubted.  The evidence remains inconclusive."]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Edgar Lobel"]}, {"page": "Catalogue of Women", "response": ["The myth of Actaeon is known to have been narrated in the Catalogue by virtue of a paraphrase found in a fragmentary dictionary of metamorphoses.Cat. fr. 217A OCT, first edited by . Before the publication of the dictionary, some version of the myth appeared to be attributed to the Cat. (called the Ehoiai) by Philodemus (On Piety B 6552\u201355 Obbink), but, because of great damage to that text, Merkelbach and West printed it as a doubtful fragment (fr. 346); the Philodemus fragment contains very little more than the name Actaeon and the citation. According to the dictionary, the Catalogue included a variant of the myth in which Actaeon was changed into a stag by Artemis and then killed by his own hounds because he attempted to take Semele as his wife, thus angering Zeus, who had designs upon the woman.The role of Zeus in the myth is not made explicit (or, at least, does not survive) in the papyri, but has been assumed by scholars; cf. , . Before this testimonium appeared, another papyrus containing 21 hexameters related to the Actaeon myth was published by Edgar Lobel, who tentatively attributed the text to the Catalogue.. This is P.Oxy. XXX 2509, printed as Cat. fr. 103 in  and fr. 162 in . As the fragment opens, Actaeon has already been torn apart by his dogs, and a goddess\u2014Athena or, less likely, ArtemisThe general consensus is that this is Athena because she occasionally acts as Zeus's courier and because the goddess is referred to as the \"daughter of great aegis-bearing Zeus\" (, aigiokhoio Dios kour\u0113 megaloio), one of Athena's common appellations; cf. , , . , argues that similar epithets are also applied to Artemis, and that her central role in the myth and status as the goddess of both the hunt and the taming of animals would make her a deity more likely to cure the hunting dogs of their madness in line 15.\u2014arrives at Chiron's cave. She prophesies to the centaur that Dionysus will be born to Semele and that Actaeon's dogs will roam the hills with him until his apotheosis, after which they will return to stay with Chiron. At this point the papyrus is damaged, but it is clear that the dogs are delivered from a \"madness\" (, lussa, line 15) and begin to mourn their master as the goddess returns to Olympus. Merkelbach and West did not include this papyrus in their edition of the fragment, the latter calling it an \"incoherent epic pastiche\" which would cause the author of the Catalogue to \"turn in his grave if he knew that it had been attributed to him.\". Twenty years later, West was \"still loth to believe\" the fragment was Hesiodic (). (\u00c0 propos of Cat. fr. 42, which reports that Chiron married a Naiad, M\u2013W do, however, cite a parallel at P.Oxy. 2509, line 3.) According to Glenn Most, some scholars believe that the text is Hellenistic,, without naming names\u2014none of the scholarship cited in the present article mentions this opinion, and Most might here be confusing this papyrus with the passages found in the Bibliotheca discussed below. but it is demonstrably archaic, and at least a few classicists today consider it to be part of the Catalogue.On the age of the fragment, see  and ; the case is made for its inclusion in the Catalogue by ,  and  .More doubtful is the attribution of ten corrupt verses found in the manuscripts of Apld. Bibl. 3.4.4 which concern the Actaeon myth. After relating the motivation for Actaeon's death which was found in the Catalogue (but attributing it to Acusilaus), Apld. reports the better-known version, in which the transformation and death are punishment for Actaeon's having seen Artemis bathing. He continues to say that Artemis transformed him into a stag and drove the dogs into a \"madness\" (, cf. P.Oxy. 2509.15) so that they wouldn't recognize their master as they devoured him. Distraught, they then went in search of Actaeon, before coming back to the cave of Chiron, who made an image of the dead man so as to cease their grief. Following this paraphrase are the ten verses interpolated into the text of the Bibliotheca () which name some of the hounds and describe their rending of Actaeon.  and  believe that these lines also derive from the Catalogue, but many consider them Hellenistic (e.g. ), and none of the recent editions include them; cf. ."]}, {"page": "Philaenis", "response": ["Fragments of a work claiming to have been written by Philaenis were discovered at Oxyrhynchus and published in 1972 as P.

Although the book was formerly believed to have been a monograph on sexual positions, the discovered fragments suggest that the scope of the work was much broader; according to Edgar Lobel, it appears to have been rather \"a systematic exposition of ars amatoria\".

M. Kirkwood in a 1964 review. Although his work on tragedy has not garnered the same admiration from fellow classicists,  Page's edition of Euripides' Medea was considered \"indispensable\" by a reviewer for the Journal of Hellenic Studies.
