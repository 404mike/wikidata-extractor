Effortlessly filling the boots of the recently departed Billy Kellock, Appleyard scored an impressive 29 goals in all competitions.  He made a particular impression in the FA Cup, scoring in all five Qualifying rounds and getting Torquay to the First Round Proper for the very first time.  Their reward was a visit from high-flying Third Division South side Reading.  6,000 supporters at Plainmoor witnessed Torquay take a first half lead over their League opponents before Reading equalised through a penalty which forced a replay at Elm Park.  A late equalising goal from George Appleyard in that match saw the fixture taken to a second replay, to be held at Bristol City's Ashton Gate ground.  However, it was to be third time unlucky for the Magpies as the League side eventually emerged with a 2\u20130 victory."]}, {"page": "Joe Little", "response": ["He made his Football League debut on 8 September for an injury-hit Argyle team at home to Crystal Palace, forming a new left-wing pairing with Billy Kellock; the Daily Express reporter felt their inclusion \"did not improve the combination\" between the forwards.
