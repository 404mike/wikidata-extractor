Leyland later played for Tranmere Rovers (playing 180 League games for them) and for the last 25 years of his life he was a very active in the running of New Brighton Rugby Union Football Club and in January 2009 a stand at their ground was named in his honour.

He was spotted in a youth international match in Brentford by Everton and signed as a professional with the club in May 1949, the \"Toffees\" seeing him as a potential replacement for 39-year-old Ted Sagar. He made his d\u00e9but as an 18-year-old against Middlesbrough in August 1950. Everton were relegated out of the First Division in 1950\u201351. They finished seven points short of promotion in 1951\u201352, before dropping to 16th in 1952\u201353, just five points above relegation. O'Neill played in the 1953 FA Cup semi-final against Bolton Wanderers, and shared the goalkeeping duties with Harry Leyland during the promotion campaign of 1953\u201354, as Cliff Britton led the club to a second-place finish, behind champions Leicester City on goal average but ahead of Blackburn Rovers by a single point. Everton then finished 11th in the top-flight in 1954\u201355, and 15th in 1955\u201356. New boss Ian Buchan led the club to 15th in 1956\u201357 and 16th in 1957\u201358. O'Neill did not get along with new manager Johnny Carey and so became unsettled. He remained though for further mid-table campaigns in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, and played a total of 213 league and cup games during his time at Goodison Park."]}, {"page": "Bert Llewellyn", "response": ["Llewellyn made his league debut for Wigan against Buxton, scoring twice in a 4\u20133 win. He formed a solid partnership with Harry Lyon, and hit 57 goals in 57 games in his first season at Springfield Park, as the \"Latics\" finished as the league's runners-up in 1965\u201366. He also helped the club to win the Cheshire League Cup, Lancashire Junior Cup and Liverpool Non League Senior Cup. He scored 28 goals in 40 games in 1966\u201367, as Wigan finished in second place again, whilst lifting four trophies: the Liverpool Non League Senior Cup, Lancashire Floodlit Cup, and the Northern Floodlit League championship and cup. Llewellyn then hit 18 goals in 35 league games in 1967\u201368, his last season in football. In all he scored 140 goals in 185 appearances across all competitions in just three seasons at Wigan, playing under the management of four different men: Allan Brown, Alf Craig, Harry Leyland, and Allan Sanders. He hit five goals on two separate occasions, hit four goals in three other games, and also claimed a total of six hat-tricks."]}]}}
