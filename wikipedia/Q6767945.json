A man of discipline, within his first fortnight with the club he had levied two fines.

The \"Valiants\" had flat-lined, and finished fifth-from-bottom in the Fourth Division in 1979\u201380, outside of the re-election zone on goals scored.

Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign. He bought striker Jim Steel from Oldham Athletic for \u00a310,000, whilst letting Ernie Moss go to Lincoln City for a \u00a31,500 fee after judging him to be too old to be of any further use.

Mind you I wouldn't, I didn't really have any mates.\" He proved to be a good signing for manager Richie Barker, and got the better of Arsenal's left-back Kenny Sansom.
