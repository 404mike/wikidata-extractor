In 1849 he had married Flora Hastings Macwhirter, the daughter of Dr John Macwhirter, late President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh.\nRenny was 32 years old, and a Lieutenant in the Bengal Horse Artillery, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny on 16 September 1857 at siege of Delhi, India when the following deed led to the award of the Victoria Cross:\nThe storming of Delhi took place between 14\u201316 September 1857 the aim of the British being to dislodge the mutineers and retake the city. When the Delhi Field Force renewed its advance on 16 September, its progress was steady and sustained. Siege guns had been brought into the city and began battering a breach in the repaired walls of the arsenal allowing the 61st Regiment and the Baluchi Battalion to storm the building.\nWithin the arsenal were no less than 171 guns and howitzers and a large quantity of ammunition. Realising the enormity of their loss, the mutineers mounted a serious counter-attack, covered by musketry fire from the roofs of nearby buildings. They set fire to the thatched roof of a shed containing explosives. With musket balls cracking around him and in imminent danger of being blown apart, Second Lieutenant Edward Thackery of the Bengal Engineers extinguished the blaze. Simultaneously, Lieutenant George Renny of the Bengal Horse Artillery climbed the arsenal's wall and flung several shells with lighted fuses into the midst of the attackers. The carnage caused by the explosion of these put an end to the attack. Both Thackery and Renny were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions.\n[ London Gazette, 12 April 1859 ], Delhi, Indian Mutiny, 16 September 1857, Captain George Alexander Renny, Bengal Horse Artillery.\nLieutenant-Colonel Farquhar, Commanding the 1st Belooch Regiment, reports that he was in command of the troops stationed in the Delhi magazine, after its capture on 16 September 1857. Early in the forenoon of that day, a vigorous attack was made on the post by the enemy, and was kept up with great force for some time, without the slightest chance of success.\nUnder cover of a heavy cross fire from the high houses on the right flank of the magazine, and from Selinghur and the Palace, the enemy advanced to the high wall of the magazine, and endeavoured to set fire to a thatched roof. The roof was partially set fire to, which was extinguished at the spot by a Sepoy of the Belooch battalion, a soldier of the 61st Regiment having in vain attempted to do so.\nThe roof having been again set on fire, Captain Renny with great gallantry mounted to the top of the wall of the magazine, and flung several shells with lighted fuzes over into the midst of the enemy, which had an almost immediate effect, as the attack at once became feeble at that point, and soon after ceased there.\nGeorge Renny was invested with his Victoria Cross by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 9 November 1860.\nHe later achieved the rank of major general. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum.\nMajor General Renny is buried in Locksbrook Cemetery, Bath, England. In early 2007 his grave was cleaned and refurbished by T Battery (Shah Sujah's Troop) Royal Artillery, successor unit of the Bengal Horse Artillery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Regiment of Artillery (India)", "response": ["**Sergeant Bernard Diamond, Gunner Richard Fitzgerald, Lieutenant Hastings Edward Harrington, Lieutenant James Hills-Johnes, Rough Rider Edward Jennings, Gunner Thomas Laughnan, Gunner Hugh McInnes, Captain William Olpherts, Gunner James Park, Captain George Alexander Renny, Lieutenant Frederick Roberts, Bombardier Jacob Thomas, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Tombs, Major Richard Keatinge."]}]}}
