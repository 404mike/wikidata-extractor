Religious Toleration in Classical Antiquity. Studies in Church History, 21, 1-27.   In his view, it is a misuse of terminology.

Garnsey explains that foreign gods were not tolerated in the modern sense, but were made subject, together with their communities, when they were conquered. The Romans \"cannot be said to have extended to them the same combination of disapproval and acceptance which is actual toleration\" in our contemporary understanding of the term.
