However, with the post-Cold War reduction in the manpower strength of the British Armed Forces and the additional reasoning that no new 5-star appointments are to be made in peacetime, since 1997 the Chief of the Defence Staff has kept the rank of admiral, general or air chief marshal, (NATO OF-9), which he invariably already holds. However, during the 2010s Guthrie, Boyce, Walker and Stirrup were honorarily promoted to their respective services' senior ranks, sometime after they had each stepped down as CDS. Although there is no policy against a Royal Marines officer being appointed, few officers in the Corps attain a high enough rank to be considered for the post. However, in 2016, Gordon Messenger was promoted to the four star rank of general and appointed as Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff."]}, {"page": "3 Commando Brigade", "response": ["*2008\u20132009 Brigadier Gordon Messenger"]}, {"page": "Comparison of United Kingdom and United States military ranks", "response": ["*Due to their modern-day size, the ranks of general and lieutenant-general are not used within 3 Commando Brigade or the main Royal Marines.
