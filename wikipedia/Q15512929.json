The show was similar to those from the 1979 season of YCDTOTV, including music videos and several earlier YCDTOTV sketches and motifs (including a variation on the show's trademark green slime gag called \"Yellow Yuck\"). Despite high ratings, the series ended after its five-episode trial run in October 1983, possibly because of complaints from parents for its content and also Nickelodeon's concern that if Don't Look Now were to be successful, it could mean the end of YCDTOTV. The series was believed lost until all five episodes surfaced in early 2013; these have been posted on YouTube, excluding the copyrighted music videos.", "Roger Price moved to France following production of the 1987 season after being informed that Nickelodeon was not planning to order more episodes, and production was suspended for 1988. When Price eventually returned to Canada, he wanted to resume production of You Can't Do That on Television from Toronto, but was convinced by the cast and crew to return to Ottawa and CJOH. Nickelodeon ordered more YCDTOTV episodes for the 1989 season. Auditions were held at CJOH in the spring of 1988, and taping began that fall.

An Oral History of Nickelodeon's Golden Age, the original slime developed \"by accident\"; Darby had originally planned for a bucket of food leftovers from the CJOH cafeteria, with water added, to be dumped on Tim, but the production of that first episode was delayed by a week, and when the time came to shoot the scene, the contents of the bucket had turned green with mold.

Produced by Thames Television for the ITV Network, the series first ran from 30 April 1973 to 19 February 1979.", "In the original series, the Tomorrow People are also referred to as both Homo Novis and Homo superior. The term Homo Superior was originally coined by Olaf Stapledon in his 1935 novel Odd John. This is also the term that comics writer Stan Lee has his Magneto character use to refer to mutants in X-Men #1, 1963. The same term later appeared in David Bowie's 1971 song \"Oh! You Pretty Things\": \"Let me make it plain. You gotta make way for the Homo Superior.\" This term came up as part of a conversation between Roger Price and David Bowie at a meeting at Granada Studios in Manchester when Price was directing a programme in which Bowie was appearing. Price had been working on a script for his Tomorrow People project and during a conversation with Bowie, the term Homo superior came up. Bowie liked the term and soon afterwards wrote it into his song. Price has sometimes been quoted as saying that the lyrics to this song were inspired by the series.", "Roger Price dreamed up the idea in 1970; he initially offered the format to Granada, where he was working, but was turned down so offered it to Southern Television, who expressed an interest but had concerns over the budgetary requirements. Finally, Lewis Rudd at Thames Television commissioned a 13-episode series, having seen the potential of the format and looking to replace Ace of Wands after its three-year run. At this time, ITV was keen to find its own answer to Doctor Who, although Price never really envisaged the show as such but more as an outlet for his own personal ideas and beliefs. Very early on, Ruth Boswell was brought in as associate producer and script editor as she had experience of children's fantasy drama (Timeslip and Tightrope) while TV dramatist Brian Finch was hired to co-write the scripts in view of the fact that Price had little experience of writing drama. Finch disliked the experience as he was not engaged by the material and found a large part of his time was taken up in trying to rein in Price and his very ambitious ideas. Thames enlisted the services of Doctor Who director Paul Bernard to help set up and oversee the first series. He would be credited as director for two stories but was unofficially a third producer. Bernard was very heavily involved in the creation of the memorable title sequence which involved a mixture of haunting images and facial shots of the main cast zooming towards the camera in monochrome, with an eerie theme tune from prolific Doctor Who composer Dudley Simpson playing behind. He got inspiration from seeing billboards rushing towards him when driving. The sequence opened with a clenched fist opening out to signify a telepathic mind breaking out. Amongst the next shots were a human foetus, shadowy figures behind scaffolding and even the insides of a bell pepper (a somewhat exotic fruit in the UK in the 1970s)."]}, {"page": "Price (surname)", "response": ["* Roger Price (Australian politician) (born 1945), Australian politician", "* Roger Price (comedy) (1918\u20131990), American comedy writer best known for his collaborations with Leonard Stern on Mad Libs", "* Roger Price (television producer) (born 1941), British television producer"]}, {"page": "Roger", "response": ["* Roger Price (comedy) (1918\u20131990), American humorist who created Droodles and Mad Libs", "* Roger Price (television producer) (born 1941), English television producer", "* Roger Price (Australian politician) (born 1945), Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives (1984\u20132010)"]}, {"page": "List of You Can't Do That on Television episodes", "response": ["| 8 || Backstage ||March 31, 1979 || Marc Baillon, Jonothan Gebert, Rodney Helal, Jim Johnson, Les Lye, Christine McGlade, Elizabeth Mitchell, Kevin Schenk, Kevin Somers||Locked out of the studio during the taping of \"the network show,\" Christine is forced to host from backstage.

In most of her scenes in 1982, she wore a wig of human hair that somewhat resembled the hairdo she had worn in 1981. However, since she could not get that human hair wig slimed or watered, for scenes involving messy or wet slapstick (including some scenes in which she was not the one to be slimed or watered), McGlade had to wear a curly synthetic wig. McGlade later referred to the period as \"the much-hated (by me) wig years\", and, while noting that she did not personally remember the incident, related a story told to her by others which involved her attempting to run over one of the wigs in the studio parking lot with her motorcycle. McGlade was allowed to host Something Else, a Price-created game/variety show which also aired on CJOH in 1982, without the wig; for this reason, there are a number of videos and photographs in circulation from this period which show her with short, dyed hair.

A sliming scene from a 1982 episode of  You Can't Do That on Television was also used in the opening of the 1987 film Fatal Attraction, and references to the series have been used in mainstream U.S. television series ranging from NewsRadio to Family Guy.
