He was able to devote his energies to her education, providing an extensive library and a number of greenhouses in the family home for her use.After qualifying as school teacher, she taught in the Dr Williams School, Dolgellau, which was a pioneering secondary school for girls.She was brought up in the Presbyterian faith but came to question this as a teenager. At this time she met Margaret Dale, another daughter of a schoolmaster. They became close friends, but Bessie wanted more from the relationship. They shared an ambition to become doctors, and Dale accepted a well-paid job at St. Andrew's Scots School, Buenos Aires. While in Argentina she was engaged to be married, but then died. When news of this reached Craigmyle, she suffered from a breakdown. Following an accident on the 46th anniversary of Margaret's death in 1933 Bessie herself died.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Craigmyle", "response": ["* Bessie Craigmyle, Scottish poet (1863\u20131933)"]}, {"page": "Dr Williams' School", "response": ["* Bessie Craigmyle was a teacher here in the 1880s."]}]}}
