He made his debut for the club the following April in a home match against Newport County. In the 1963\u201364 season he made 25 appearances and helped the club to win the championship of the Football League Fourth Division. At the end of the season, however, manager Freddie Cox decided that Stringfellow would not feature in his plans at the higher level, and the player moved to Chesterfield in an exchange deal which saw Charlie Rackstraw move in the opposite direction. Stringfellow made 28 appearances for the \"Spireites\", scoring seven goals, but in December 1964 he was involved in a car crash in which teammate Ralph Hunt (the brother of Stringfellow's former Gillingham teammate Dennis Hunt) was killed and two other players injured.  Stringfellow had been driving the car which crashed, but no responsibility was attached to him for the accident. Nonetheless, following the accident, his form dramatically declined and he was allowed to leave Saltergate at the end of the season. He chose to emigrate to Australia, and no details are known of his subsequent life."]}, {"page": "Rackstraw", "response": ["*Charlie Rackstraw (born 1938), English footballer"]}]}}
