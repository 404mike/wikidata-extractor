In 1935, Pam Barton reached the final again, beating her sister Mervyn in the semi-finals, but lost, this time to Wanda Morgan. In 1936 Bridget Newell led the qualifying and reached the final where she met Pam Barton. Barton won the final 7&5 to win her first championship. The 1937 championship was played at Turnberry. Bridget Newell had died just before the event, causing the Home Internationals to be cancelled. However, the championship continued as normal. There had been a reduction in the number of entries and qualifying was dropped, the event returning to the earlier Monday to Friday dates.
