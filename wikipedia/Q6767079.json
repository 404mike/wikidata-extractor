Freelance journalist Chris Scullion praised the character as an example of a \"rare, well-rounded female lead\" in video games. Agnello lauded the subtle approach utilized in the progression of Ashley's character arc and her investigation of the mysteries surrounding her. Skiles found Ashley's personality to be more sarcastic in the sequel, with \"a far more interesting variety of actions and reactions\" as she is fully animated. He lauded the game's writing for the convincing portrayal of Ashley's growth in between games and called it one of its highlights. Conversely, Oli Welsh from Eurogamer felt that while the focus on a confused teenage girl is a welcome change, the game's slow pace fails to make her narrative journey compelling. This iteration of the character has been noted by the 2010 publication EZ Guides: The Games of the Decade to be more \"tailored for the female demographic\", citing story elements like the use of conventionally attractive male characters befriended by Ashley, her personal desire to be a musician, and the game's portrayal of her issues with her father, as being gender orientated aspects and a shift in tone from \"Agatha Cristie and more One Tree Hill. Mark Clapham expressed disappointment at Ashley's story arc within Another Code: R, noting that the character was \"never really threatened\" and criticized the realism behind her approach to problem solving.
