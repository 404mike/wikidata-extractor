Within a week this had improved to 1\u00a0kW, and within the next few months, with the addition of water cooling and many detail changes, this had improved to 10 and then 25\u00a0kW. To deal with its drifting frequency, they sampled the output signal and synchronized their receiver to whatever frequency was actually being generated. In 1941, the problem of frequency instability was solved by James Sayers coupling (\"strapping\") alternate cavities within the magnetron which reduced the instability by a factor of 5\u20136. (For an overview of early magnetron designs, including that of Boot and Randall, see ) According to Andy Manning from the RAF Air Defence Radar Museum, Randall and Boot's discovery was \"a massive, massive breakthrough\" and \"deemed by many, even now, to be the most important invention that came out of the Second World War\", while professor of military history at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, David Zimmerman, states:"]}, {"page": "University of Birmingham", "response": ["The cavity magnetron was developed in the Department of Physics by Sir John Randall, Harry Boot and James Sayers.

The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941.

VIII radar", "response": ["Additionally, during this period the magnetron team at Birmingham had made a breakthrough. One of the problems with the magnetron was that every pulse caused slightly different oscillations within each cavity, sometimes interfering with each other. With some patterns, particularly the pi mode, the signals added up and the tube was much more efficient. James Sayers had discovered that if a strap of metal was run between alternating lobes of the magnetron's cavities, the pi mode was strongly favoured. This allowed power levels to be greatly increased, and GEC began producing the new CV64, designed to operate at as much as 50\u00a0kW.
