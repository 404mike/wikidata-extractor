Sorrell came to the attention of Wright through recommendations from conducting faculty at the Aspen Music Festival and Tanglewood Music Festival where she had studied under Leonard Bernstein, Roger Norrington and others. Wright was handling the Cleveland Orchestra's search for an assistant conductor, and he invited Sorrell to an interview for the position.  The interview was conducted by Cleveland Orchestra Music Director Christoph von Dohn\u00e1nyi along with Roger Wright. During the interview, Dohn\u00e1nyi told Sorrell that there was \"no point in finding time with the orchestra for her to audition, as the audience in Cleveland would never accept a woman as a conductor.\" Sorrell replied that she had not applied for this job, and her true goal was to work with a period-instrument orchestra.
