Despite being released on the charge of murder, Maria is arrested again, as she reveals to MacKinnon during an interview that she had organised a sham marriage between herself and Pablo in order to grant him residence in the country. Maria is ordered to serve a 12-month custodial sentence, but ends up serving a couple of months before she is released. MacKinnon is the lead officer investigating an attack on Ken in March 2017.
