Dover had died in 1652, and bereft of his influence, the games became \"just another drunken country festival\", according to an account written by the poet William Somervile in 1740. By then the games, known as Dover's Meeting, were well established and once again quite popular, and included events such as backsword fighting. It is unclear whether the contestants fought with metal or wooden swords, but there is no doubt that very real danger was involved. During a fight at the beginning of the 19th century, one of the contestants was so badly injured that he died soon afterwards. The wrestling competitions had become shin-kicking contests, with competitors wearing heavily nailed boots, sometimes with pointed tips. The poet and writer Richard Graves described the games in his picaresque novel The Spiritual Quixote (1773) as a \"heathenish assembly\". Somervile's account of the 1740 games describes a general riot in which \"chairs, and forms, and battered bowls are hurled/With fell intent; like bombs the bottles fly\". Graves dramatised the enthusiasm for the women's race for a Holland shift displayed on a pole: \"six young women began to exhibit themselves before the whole assembly, in a dress hardly reconcilable to the rules of decency\". By 1845 the games were being organised by a local publican, William Drury, who paid \u00a35 for the right to do so. He hired out space for stalls and booths, and presumably sold alcohol at the event. The rector of Weston-sub-Edge, the parish in which Dover's Hill is located, Reverend Geoffrey Drinkwater Bourne, claimed that up to 30,000\u00a0people were attending the games by then, and that the hillside was full of drunk and disorderly individuals.

Originally from Yorkshire, they came to Ireland with Oliver Cromwell, when their ancestor, Colonel William Graves (who became a Cavalier after being placed in charge of Charles I of England) commanded a Regiment of Horse and was granted land there in 1647.

He has written on many subjects, and on all well. His work on the Pentateuch is used in the English universities as well as in Dublin. And we may safely say, that it never has been perused without great benefit. Nor are his other works indicative of less ability, though their subjects have not brought them so prominently before the religious world...
