Martin was not interested in sacrificing so much of the overall story. When the pilot for the HBO adaptation went into production years later, one of the first parts cast was Jon, with Kit Harington announced in the role in July 2009. Alfie Allen and Iwan Rheon had also auditioned for the role, and were brought into the show to play Theon Greyjoy and Ramsay Snow instead, respectively. In October 2014, Harington and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. The Hollywood Reporter called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". Deadline Hollywood put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and The Hollywood Reporter wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight.
