In particular, they used mirror symmetry to show that a six-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of degree three. In addition to counting degree-three curves, Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians.Yau and Nadis, p. 171", "During this period, David Gross, Jeffrey Harvey, Emil Martinec, and Ryan Rohm discovered heterotic strings. The gauge group of these closed strings was two copies of E8, and either copy could easily and naturally include the standard model. Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz, Andrew Strominger and Edward Witten found that the Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds are the compactifications that preserve a realistic amount of supersymmetry, while Lance Dixon and others worked out the physical properties of orbifolds, distinctive geometrical singularities allowed in string theory. Cumrun Vafa generalized T-duality from circles to arbitrary manifolds, creating the mathematical field of mirror symmetry. Daniel Friedan, Emil Martinec and Stephen Shenker further developed the covariant quantization of the superstring using conformal field theory techniques. David Gross and Vipul Periwal discovered that string perturbation theory was divergent. Stephen Shenker showed it diverged much faster than in field theory suggesting that new non-perturbative objects were missing."]}, {"page": "Shing-Tung Yau", "response": ["* A special case of the Calabi conjecture asserts that a K\u00e4hler metric of zero Ricci curvature must exist on any K\u00e4hler manifold whose first Chern class is zero. In string theory, it was discovered in 1985 by Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz, Andrew Strominger, and Edward Witten that these \"Calabi-Yau manifolds,\" due to their special holonomy, are the appropriate configuration spaces for superstrings.Candelas, P.; Horowitz, Gary T.; Strominger, Andrew; Witten, Edward. Vacuum configurations for superstrings. Nuclear Phys. B 258 (1985), no. 1, 46\u201374.

Mirror symmetry, which is a proposal of physicists dating to the late 80s, postulates that Calabi\u2212Yau manifolds of complex dimension three can be grouped into pairs which share characteristics, such as Euler and Hodge numbers. Based on this conjectural picture, the physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes proposed a formula of enumerative geometry which encodes the number of rational curves of any fixed degree in a general quintic hypersurface of four-dimensional complex projective space.Candelas, Philip; de la Ossa, Xenia C.; Green, Paul S.; Parkes, Linda.

Mathematicians became interested in this relationship around 1990 when Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that it could be used as a tool in enumerative geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count rational curves on a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been proven rigorously.", "The idea of mirror symmetry can be traced back to the mid-1980s when it was noticed that a string propagating on a circle of radius R is physically equivalent to a string propagating on a circle of radius 1/R in appropriate units.This was first observed in Kikkawa and Yamasaki 1984 and Sakai and Senda 1986. This phenomenon is now known as T-duality and is understood to be closely related to mirror symmetry.Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow 1996 In a paper from 1985, Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz, Andrew Strominger, and Edward Witten showed that by compactifying string theory on a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold, one obtains a theory roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics that also consistently incorporates an idea called supersymmetry.Candelas et al. 1985 Following this development, many physicists began studying Calabi\u2013Yau compactifications, hoping to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string theory. Cumrun Vafa and others noticed that given such a physical model, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi\u2013Yau manifold. Instead, there are two Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds that give rise to the same physics.This was observed in Dixon 1988 and Lerche, Vafa, and Warner 1989.", "By studying the relationship between Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds and certain conformal field theories called Gepner models, Brian Greene and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship.Green and Plesser 1990; Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 158 Further evidence for this relationship came from the work of Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.Candelas, Lynker, and Schimmrigk 1990; Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 163", "Mathematicians became interested in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry could be used to solve problems in enumerative geometryCandelas et al. 1991 that had resisted solution for decades or more.Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 165 These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Str\u00f8mme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques.Yau and Nadis 2010, pp. 169\u2013170 Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Str\u00f8mme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 170", "By the year 1991, most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish.
