Her study of radiation-induced illness among workers at the Hanford plutonium production plant, Washington,  is frequently cited by those who seek to demonstrate that even very low doses of radiation cause substantial hazard. She was the first person to demonstrate the link between x-rays of pregnant women and high cancer rates in their children.
