In 1946 he took up a research position with Metropolitan-Vickers, leading to a secondment to Bristol University, where Nobel laureate Nevill Mott was head of the department. After gaining his PhD, he took a position at Reading University in 1951, becoming professor of physics in 1961, and later dean of science and deputy vice chancellor. In 1978 he became Dr Lees professor of experimental philosophy at Oxford University and head of the Clarendon laboratory.He was also a skilled administrator who served in many public capacities. He became chairman of SERC in 1985, at a time of conflict between the British government and higher education over funding and independence. He was vice-president of the European Science Foundation from 1989 to 1992 and president of CERN in 1991. Mitchell was also a member of the SEPP Board of Science Advisors. He won the Richard Glazebrook Medal and Prize in 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kingsbridge", "response": ["* Sir William Mitchell (1925\u20132002), physicist, was born here."]}, {"page": "William Mitchell", "response": ["William Mitchell may refer to:", "* William Mitchell (sculptor) (1925\u20132020), English sculptor and muralist", "* William Mitchell, former alias of actor Peter Finch", "* William Mitchell (barrister) (died 1937), Scottish Advocate and Liberal  politician", "* William Mitchell (Burnley MP) (1838\u20131914), Conservative MP for Burnley, 1900\u20131905", "* William Mitchell (congressman) (1807\u20131865), Congressman from Indiana", "* William Mitchell (Huntingdonshire MP) (c. 1703\u20131745), Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire, 1741\u20131745", "* William Mitchell (North Dakota) (1830\u20131890), North Dakota Superintendent of Public Instruction", "* William Mitchell (died 1823), Member of Parliament for Plympton Erle, 1796\u20131799", "* William Mitchell (Canadian politician) (1851\u20131926), Canadian senator", "* William Mitchell (Australian politician) (1850\u20131923), member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "* William Mitchell (RAF officer) (1888\u20131944), senior Royal Air Force commander and former Black Rod", "* William Mitchell (Royal Navy officer) (c. 1745\u20131816), Royal Navy admiral", "* William Mitchell (mathematician), set theorist, see J\u00f3nsson cardinal", "* William Mitchell (physicist) (1925\u20132002), Oxford physicist who helped pioneer neutron scattering", "* William Mitchell (cricketer, born 1859) (1859\u20131929), English cricketer", "* William Mitchell (philosopher) (1861\u20131962), University of Adelaide Professor, Vice Chancellor and Chancellor, 1942\u20131948", "* William Mitchell (missionary) (1803\u20131870), Anglican priest who established religious services in the Swan River Colony", "* William Mitchell (Scottish entrepreneur) (1781\u20131854), co-founder of the Alloa Coal Company", "* William Mitchell College of Law, law school named for William B.
