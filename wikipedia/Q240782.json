Mill believe that the moral and intellectual advancement from giving women the opportunity to be considered equal would translate to greater happiness for everyone involved.  He believed that all humans had the capability of being educated and civilized, with which he argued women should be given the right to vote.  Throughout the book Mill continues to argue that both men and women should be able to vote to defend their rights and be able to have the opportunity to stand on their own two feet morally and intellectually, and constantly used his position in Parliament to advocate for women's suffrage.John Stuart Mills (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\". plato.stanford.edu.
