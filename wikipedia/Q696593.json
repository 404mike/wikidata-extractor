The former he shared with his wife Alice Bertha Gomme, born Alice Merck (1853\u20131938), whom he married on 31 March 1875.  The couple had seven sons, including Arthur Allan Gomme, a librarian and historian of technology, and Arnold Wycombe Gomme, a noted classical scholar.Robert Gomme, \"Gomme, Alice Bertha, Lady Gomme (1853\u20131938)\", Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: OUP, 2004, online ed. 2006). Both Gomme and his wife were founder members of the Folklore Society in 1878; and Gomme went on to be its honorary secretary, director and president.Gomme (1916), 408; Gomme (2004). Gomme wrote many books and articles on folklore, including Primitive Folk Moots (1880), Folklore Relics of Early Village Life (1883), Ethnology in Folklore (1892) and Folklore as a Historical Science (1908).  His work in the field is now generally regarded as too dependent on a survivals theory, which tried to trace folk customs back to earlier stages of civilisation; but it retains value as a collection.Simpson and Roud (2000), 149\u201350; 349. His historical writings show a particular interest in the history of London, in books such as The Governance of London (1907) and The Making of London (1912). He was also one of the founders of the Victoria County History project,Gomme (2004); Victoria County History news release. and had a passion for old buildings. He used his council position to protect threatened buildings and to advance the Survey of London, to which he also contributed historical material. Another overlap of his historical and professional interests was the blue plaque commemorative scheme, which he persuaded the council to take on in 1901: the 800th blue plaque to be awarded would later mark his own London residence in 24 Dorset Square.Gomme (2004); \"English Heritage celebrates 800th blue plaque\", English Heritage press release."]}, {"page": "Arnold Gomme", "response": ["#Redirect Arnold Wycombe Gomme"]}, {"page": "Women in Classical Athens", "response": ["Until the 1980s, scholars of women in classical Athens were primarily interested in the status of women and how they were viewed by men. Early feminist scholarship aimed to assert that women were significant in ancient history and to demonstrate how they had been oppressed. Early scholars held that Athenian women had an \"ignoble\" place, but in 1925 this position was challenged by Arnold Wycombe Gomme. According to Gomme, women had high social status despite their limited legal rights; his view has reinforced that position ever since. Pomeroy attributes the variety of viewpoints to the types of evidence prioritised by scholars, with those arguing for the high status of Athenian women predominantly citing tragedy and those arguing against it emphasising oratory."]}, {"page": "Andor Gomme", "response": ["Andor was the son of Arnold Wycombe Gomme, a British classical scholar and Professor of Ancient History at the University of Glasgow and Phyllis Kate Harvey. The first name Andor was originally a nickname, and began as a family joke for the unborn baby (or babies) of unknown sex. He studied at Clare College, Cambridge, where he was taught by F.R. Leavis and attained a First Class Honours degree in Moral Sciences. He was appointed to a three-year fellowship at Gonville and Caius College in 1956."]}]}}
