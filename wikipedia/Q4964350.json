He played as a centre half for Notts County, Coventry City, Oldham Athletic, Newcastle United, Swindon Town, Mansfield Town and Halifax Town, and was famous for his long hair and moustache.\nKilcline captained Coventry City in the 1987 FA Cup Final at Wembley against Tottenham Hotspur. At the time it was thought that Kilcline was possibly responsible for scoring an own-goal to give Spurs a 2\u20131 lead on the 40 minute mark, but this goal was eventually accredited to Gary Mabbutt. Kilcline and Mabbutt were to clash again in the second half when Kilcline brought down Mabbutt with a tackle. Kilcline was not cautioned by referee Neil Midgley but had to be replaced by substitute Graham Rodger just a minute before the end of normal time due to the injury he himself sustained in the clash. After Coventry's extra time winner (the match finished 3-2) Kilcline limped slowly up the famous Wembley step to receive the trophy for the only time in Coventry's history.In 1991, Kilcline joined newly promoted Oldham Athletic but his stay at the club was not to be a long one.\nWhen Kevin Keegan became manager of Newcastle United in 1992, \"Killer\" Kilcline was his first signing, and was immediately installed as club captain. He became known for his hard tackling and aerial ability - he often would prefer a diving header to a volley, even for balls only half a metre off the ground. Keegan later remarked that Kilcline was the most important signing he had ever made for the club. This was echoed by fans, who considered him partially responsible for saving the club from relegation and possible bankruptcy.\nDuring the 1993\u201394 season, he briefly played for Swindon Town in the Premier League and wore the squad number 31.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["Further assessing his squad, Keegan noted some players could not handle the pressure and would sneak in by a turnstile rather than meet and greet the big crowds at the front entrance prior to games.

Keegan signed the experienced Brian Kilcline. Keegan stated about Kilcline, \"Even on his bad days his head never dropped, he was tough as teak, absolutely fearless\" and \"He was a ready-made captain - one of my more important signings as Newcastle's manager.\" Keegan's managerial guidance in the 1991\u201392 season helped secure survival, which meant Newcastle United would play in the new Division One for the 1992\u201393 season."]}, {"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  Brian Kilcline", "|  Brian Kilcline", "|  Brian Kilcline", "|  Brian Kilcline", "|  Brian Kilcline", "|  Brian Kilcline"]}, {"page": "Fantasy Football League", "response": ["*Jeff Astle Sings \u2013 former West Bromwich Albion player (and Frank's idol) Jeff Astle would come in at the end of the show and lead the guests in an improbable rendition of a classic song over the credits.

Steve Ogrizovic, who would go on to break the club's appearance record, joined from Shrewsbury, Brian Kilcline moved from Notts County, and England-international Cyrille Regis switched from West Bromwich Albion. But the season started poorly, developing into another relegation fight, and Gould was sacked after two lacklustre defeats at Christmas, being replaced by his assistant Don Mackay. Their form improved, but they remained in deep relegation trouble. After a number of game cancellations in April due to a bout of flu, Coventry had three games to play after most other teams had completed their fixtures. Relegation rivals Norwich were eight points ahead, which left City requiring wins in all three games. In the first, they narrowly beat already-relegated Stoke, surviving when a late penalty hit the bar, and in the second they beat Luton with a winner six minutes before the end. The final game was at Highfield Road against Everton, who were already guaranteed the league championship. Coventry put on one of their best performances of the season, winning 4\u20131 to complete an unlikely escape and send Norwich down. In 1985\u201386 they faced their third successive relegation battle which went down to the final game. Home form was particularly poor, as City did not win any games at Highfield Road between 6 October and 22 February.

Coventry City's youth team also won the FA Youth Cup in 1987 (beating Charlton Athletic 2\u20131) to secure a remarkable 'double'.
