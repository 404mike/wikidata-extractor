St Albans beat FC Clifton Hill, Avondale FC, Eastern Lions SC and Northcote City FC to qualify for the FFA Cup Round of 32. Dinamo drew Parramatta FC at the Melita Stadium in Sydney, Australia. Barry Devlin scored the lone goal as Dinamo progressed to the Round of 16. Dinamo then drew A-League side Perth Glory. The match was played at sister-club Melbourne Knights' Knights Stadium. The game was played in front of 3,500 supporters, with the entire Victorian Croatian community rallying around the side for this huge encounter. Unfortunately, Dinamo lost by four goals to one, as their fully professional opponents' quality shone through in the second half. St Albans sacked head coach Toby Paterson and his son Brodie in September 2014, after an altercation broke out in their Round 23 NPL clash against Richmond SC. Captain Ryan McGuffie took on a caretaker player-coach role, leading the side in the remainder of the 2014 season. At the club's AGM towards the end of 2014, Richmond FC star ruckman Ivan Mari\u0107 was appointed as president of the club."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Ryan McGuffie"]}, {"page": "Alex Walker (footballer, born 1984)", "response": ["He began his career at Rangers, where he made 2 appearances.
