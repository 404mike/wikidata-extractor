Steel FRAS (born 11 June 1955) is a British scientist born in Midsomer Norton, Somerset. Currently he lives in Wellington, New Zealand, but holds visiting positions as a Professor of astrobiology at the University of Buckingham in England; as a space scientist at NASA-Ames Research Center in California; and as an astronomer at Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland. Duncan is a space science authority who has worked with NASA to assess the threat of comet and asteroid collisions and investigate technologies to avert such impacts. He is also the author of four popular-level science books on space, and regularly writes for The Guardian and various other newspapers and magazines. He is a discoverer of minor planets including the main-belt asteroid 9767 Midsomer Norton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 11", "response": ["*  1955   \u2013 Duncan Steel, English-Australian astronomer and author"]}, {"page": "1955 in science", "response": ["* June 11 \u2013 Duncan Steel, English/Australasian space scientist."]}, {"page": "List of minor planets named after people", "response": ["*4713 Steel (Duncan Steel)"]}, {"page": "Midsomer Norton", "response": ["* Duncan Steel (born 1955), writer on space science"]}, {"page": "4923 Clarke", "response": ["This minor planet was named after the science fiction writer Arthur C.

Duncan Steel, Gerhard Hahn, Mark Bailey, and David Asher carried out projections of its long-term dynamical evolution, and found a good probability that it will become an Earth-crosser asteroid, and may spend a quarter of its life in such an orbit.
