They were facing a prison sentence at the time and in exchange for their help, the FBI agreed to let them out on probation. Weinberg, supervised by the FBI, created a fake company called Abdul Enterprises in which FBI employees posed as fictional Arab sheikhs led by owners Kambir Abdul Rahman and Yassir Habib, who had millions of dollars to invest in the United States. Weinberg instructed the FBI to fund a $1\u00a0million-account with the Chase Manhattan Bank in the name of the fictional company, Abdul Enterprises, giving the company the credibility it needed to further its operation."]}, {"page": "Black & White Records", "response": ["In 1948, Supreme Records recorded in Los Angeles and released \"A Little Bird Told Me,\" written by Harvey Oliver Brooks (1899\u20131968), sung by Paula Watson (1927\u20132003), who is African American, accompanied by guitarist Mitchell \"Tiny\" Webb, and others. Her version spent 14 weeks on Billboards R&B charts in 1948 and 1949, reaching number 2 on the R&B charts and number 6 on the pop charts. In 1948, Decca released a cover version, sung by Evelyn Knight (1917\u20132007), who was white. Knight copied Watson's singing to the degree that it fooled musical experts brought into court as witnesses. Knight was accompanied by a band that included Walter Page on bass, the Stardusters (vocal group), and Johnny Parker (vocal and hand-clapping). Supreme claimed that Decca had stolen aspects of its original recording, including its arrangement, texture, and vocal style.
