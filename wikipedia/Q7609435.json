He noted there was an apparent misconception about the composition of Parliament: \"It is fundamental within the precepts of the principles of Parliamentary Sovereignty that a chamber of the legislature is not sovereign, it is instead the Queen-in-Parliament which is sovereign.\" Ali reiterated an argument he made before the judgment in the Oxford University Political Blog that in lieu of dissolution and prorogation, future prime ministers may ask the sovereign to refuse royal assent to any bill until the House of Commons agreed to call an early general election, which he argued would likely cause far greater public outrage than prorogation. Ali invoked an A. V. Dicey argument that\u2014where Parliament is sovereign\u2014dissolution is necessary both for security and harmony between the government and Parliament, and concluded that: \"Paradoxically, in its quest to control its own destiny, the House of Commons might achieve the opposite.\""]}]}}
