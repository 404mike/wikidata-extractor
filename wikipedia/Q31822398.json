Before the end of the campaign, Brown received two foul challenges in which the perpetrator appeared to deliberately stamp on his groin area: Andrew Davies of Ross County was ordered off at the time, with Brown stating \"I didn't want more kids anyway\" but later adding that \"Stamping on opponents when the ball is nowhere near you is definitely not being a hard man or going into a hard tackle\"; the referee took no action against Steven Naismith of Hearts at the time, but the Scotland forward was later banned by the SFA. On the latter incident, Brown commented \"I think they try to wind me up and get me sent off but let's be honest, I am past that stage and have matured eventually. So it is not going to work.\""]}, {"page": "Knutsford Academy", "response": ["* Sam Cosgrove - Aberdeen Footballer."]}, {"page": "List of Aberdeen F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Sam Cosgrove||17", "|align=\"left\"|Sam Cosgrove||11"]}, {"page": "Aberdeen F.C. in European football", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Sam Cosgrove || 6 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 6"]}, {"page": "Nick Pope (footballer)", "response": ["On 19 July 2016, Pope joined newly promoted Premier League club Burnley on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.
