An adventurous football romantic with an indefatigable appetite for planning and organisation, Roy believed in football's ability to bridge geographic and political distances. He was also quick to recognise the new opportunities for adventure that new and enterprising tour operators could offer working-class boys like himself, and the club eventually became one of the most prolific touring clubs in English amateur football history."]}]}}
