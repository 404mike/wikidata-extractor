But military victory was rapidly followed by political defeat as Churchill lost the June 1945 general election. He almost immediately went abroad, while Clementine went back to Chartwell to begin the long process of opening up the house for his return\u2014\"it will be lovely when the lake camouflage is gone\". Later that year, Churchill again gave thought to selling Chartwell, concerned by the expense of running the estate. A group of friends, organised by Lord Camrose, raised the sum of \u00a355,000 which was passed to the National Trust allowing it to buy the house from Churchill for \u00a343,800. The excess provided an endowment. The sale was completed on 29 November. For payment of a rent of \u00a3350 per annum, plus rates, the Churchills committed to a 50-year lease, allowing them to live at Chartwell until their deaths, at which point the property would revert to the National Trust. Churchill recorded his gratitude in a letter to Camrose in December 1945, \"I feel how inadequate my thanks have been, my dear Bill, who (...) never wavered in your friendship during all these long and tumultuous years\". In October 1946, Hastings \"Pug\" Ismay, Churchill's chief of staff during the war and a frequent guest at Churchill's \"own beloved Chartwell\", recorded his chief's observation on the outcome of the Nuremberg trials: \"It shows that you get into a war, it is supremely important to win it. You and I would be in a pretty pickle if we had lost\".
