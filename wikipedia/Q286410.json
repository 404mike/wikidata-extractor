He is the lead guitarist and keyboardist of the alternative rock band Radiohead, and has written a number of film scores.\nAlong with his elder brother, Radiohead bassist Colin, Greenwood attended Abingdon School in Abingdon near Oxford, England, where he met the future band members. The youngest of the group, Greenwood was the last to join, first playing keyboards and harmonica but soon becoming lead guitarist. He abandoned a degree in music when the band signed to Parlophone; their debut single \"Creep\" was distinguished by Greenwood's aggressive guitar work. Radiohead have since achieved critical acclaim and sold over 30 million albums. Along with the other members of Radiohead, Greenwood was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.\nGreenwood was named the 48th greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone. A multi-instrumentalist, he uses instruments including bass guitar, piano, viola, and drums, and is a prominent player of the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument. He uses electronic techniques such as programming, sampling and looping, and writes music software used by Radiohead. He described his role in the band as an arranger, helping to transform Thom Yorke's demos into finished songs.\nRadiohead albums feature Greenwood's string and brass arrangements, and he has composed for orchestras including the London Contemporary Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra. His first solo work, the soundtrack for the film Bodysong, was released in 2003. In 2007, he scored There Will Be Blood, the first of several collaborations with director Paul Thomas Anderson; in 2018, he was nominated for an Academy Award for his score for Anderson's Phantom Thread. Greenwood's other scores include two collaborations with director Lynne Ramsay. He has collaborated several times with the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur, including on the 2015 album Junun. In 2021, Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile, with Yorke and drummer Tom Skinner.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Electronic musical instrument", "response": ["Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris.

Guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year, guitarist Ed O'Brien and drummer Philip Selway the year above, and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin, two years below. In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became lead guitarist; he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and Yorke's brother Andy Yorke. According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, rather than through any particular interest: \"It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool.\" At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section.", "Having introduced more new songs on tour, Radiohead finished recording their second album by the end of 1994, and released The Bends in March 1995. The album was driven by dense riffs and ethereal atmospheres from the three guitarists, with greater use of keyboards than their debut. It received stronger reviews for its songwriting and performances. While Radiohead were seen as outsiders to the Britpop scene that dominated music media at the time, they were finally successful in their home country with The Bends, as singles \"Fake Plastic Trees\", \"High and Dry\", \"Just\", and \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" made their way to chart success. \"High and Dry\" became a modest hit, but Radiohead's growing fanbase was insufficient to repeat the worldwide success of \"Creep\". The Bends peaked at No. 88 on the US album charts, which remains Radiohead's lowest showing there. Jonny Greenwood said The Bends had been a \"turning point\" for Radiohead: \"It started appearing in people's [best-of] polls for the end of the year. That's when it started to feel like we made the right choice about being a band.\" In later years, The Bends appeared in many publications' lists of the best albums of all time, including Rolling Stone's 2012 edition of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" at No. 111.", "In 1995, Radiohead again toured North America and Europe, this time in support of R.E.M., one of their formative influences and at the time one of the biggest rock bands in the world. The buzz generated by such famous fans as R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe, along with distinctive music videos for \"Just\" and \"Street Spirit\", helped to sustain Radiohead's popularity outside the UK.Randall, p. 127 The night before a performance in Denver, Colorado, Radiohead's tour van was stolen, and with it their musical equipment.

Their first live video, Live at the Astoria, was released in 1995.", "Radiohead released their third album, OK Computer, in May 1997. It found the band experimenting with song structures and incorporating ambient, avant-garde and electronic influences, prompting Rolling Stone to call the album a \"stunning art-rock tour de force\". Radiohead denied being part of the progressive rock genre, but critics began to compare their work to Pink Floyd, whose early 1970s work influenced Jonny Greenwood's guitar parts at the time. Some compared OK Computer thematically to Floyd's bestseller The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), although Yorke said the album's lyrics were inspired by observing the \"speed\" of the world in the 1990s. Yorke's lyrics, embodying different characters, had expressed what one magazine called \"end-of-the-millennium blues\" in contrast to the more personal songs of The Bends. According to journalist Alex Ross, Radiohead had become \"the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation\u2014as the Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before\". OK Computer received critical acclaim. Yorke said he was \"amazed it got the reaction it did. None of us fucking knew any more whether it was good or bad. What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create.\"", "Hail to the Thief was Radiohead's final album with EMI; in 2006, the New York Times described Radiohead as \"by far the world's most popular unsigned band\". Following the Hail to the Thief tour, Radiohead went on hiatus to spend time with their families and work on solo projects. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood contributed to the Band Aid 20 charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", produced by Godrich. Greenwood composed soundtracks for the films Bodysong (2004) and There Will Be Blood (2007); the latter was the first of several collaborations between Greenwood and director Paul Thomas Anderson.", "In July 2006, Yorke released his debut solo album, The Eraser, comprising mainly electronic music. He stressed it was made with the band's blessing, and that Radiohead were not breaking up. Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood said: \"He had to get this stuff out, and everyone was happy [for Yorke to make it] ... He'd go mad if every time he wrote a song it had to go through the Radiohead consensus.\"", "The retail version of In Rainbows was released in the UK in late December 2007 on XL Recordings and in North America in January 2008 on TBD Records, charting at number one in the UK and in the US. The success \u2013 after having been legally available for months as a free download \u2013 was Radiohead's highest chart placement in the US since Kid A. It became their fifth UK number-one album and sold more than three million copies in one year. The album received acclaim for its more accessible sound and personal lyrics. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize and won the 2009 Grammy awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. It was nominated for five other Grammy awards, including Radiohead's third nomination for Album of the Year. Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed \"15 Step\" with the University of Southern California Marching Band at the televised award show.", "In May 2009, Radiohead began new recording sessions with Godrich. In August, they released \"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\", a tribute song to Harry Patch, the last surviving British soldier to have fought in World War I, with proceeds donated to the British Legion. The song has no conventional rock instrumentation, and instead comprises Yorke's vocals and a string arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood. Later that month, another new song, \"These Are My Twisted Words\", featuring krautrock-like drumming and guitars, was leaked via torrent, possibly by Radiohead. It was released as a free download on the Radiohead website the following week. Commentators saw the releases as part of Radiohead's new unpredictable release strategy, without the need for traditional marketing.", "In 2009, Yorke formed a new band to perform his solo material, Atoms for Peace, with musicians including Godrich and Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea. The band played eight North American shows in 2010. In January 2010, Radiohead played their only full concert of the year in the Los Angeles Henry Fonda Theater as a benefit for Oxfam. Tickets were auctioned, raising over half a million US dollars for the NGO's 2010 Haiti earthquake relief. In September 2010, Radiohead released the soundboard recording of their 2009 Prague performance for use in a fan-made concert video, Live in Praha. In December, a fan-made video of Radiohead's Oxfam benefit performance, Radiohead for Haiti, was released via YouTube and torrent with Radiohead's support and a \"pay-what-you-want\" link to donate to Oxfam. The videos were described as examples of Radiohead's openness to fans and positivity toward non-commercial internet distribution. In June 2010, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood performed a surprise set at Glastonbury Festival, performing Eraser and Radiohead songs, while Selway released his debut solo album, Familial in August.", "In February 2014, Radiohead released the Polyfauna app for smartphones, a collaboration with the British digital arts studio Universal Everything using music and imagery from The King of Limbs. In May, Yorke contributed a soundtrack, Subterranea, to The Panic Office, an installation of Radiohead artwork in Sydney, Australia. Yorke and Selway released their solo albums Tomorrow's Modern Boxes and Weatherhouse in late 2014. Jonny Greenwood scored his third Anderson film, Inherent Vice; it features a new version of an unreleased Radiohead song, \"Spooks\", performed by Greenwood and members of Supergrass.

In September, the nature documentary series Blue Planet II premiered featuring a new version of the King of Limbs track \"Bloom\", created with composer Hans Zimmer.", "In 2017, Selway released his third solo work, the soundtrack to the film Let Me Go. Jonny Greenwood scored his second film by Lynne Ramsay, You Were Never Really Here (2018), and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for his fifth collaboration with Anderson, Phantom Thread (2017). Yorke released his first feature film soundtrack, Suspiria (2018), and his third solo album, Anima (2019), backed by a short film directed by Anderson. O'Brien released his debut solo album, Earth, in 2020. He had been writing songs for years, but felt they had a \"distinct energy\" that would be lost with Radiohead.", "In a livestream event held by Glastonbury Festival in May 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile, a collaboration with Godrich and drummer Tom Skinner. Greenwood said the project was a way for him and Yorke to work together during the COVID-19 lockdown. Guardian critic Alexis Petridis described the Smile as \"more skeletal and knottier version of Radiohead\", with unusual time signatures, complex riffs and \"hard-driving\" motorik psychedelia.", "Radiohead have cited 60s and 70s jazz artists such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Alice Coltrane as influences. According to Jonny Greenwood, \u201cWe bring in our favourite jazz albums, and say: we want to do this. And we enjoy the sound of our failing!\" He likened their jazz influence to 1950s English bands imitating American blues records. Drummer Clive Deamer, who has recorded and performed with Radiohead since 2011, said Radiohead do not see themselves as a rock band and that their methodology had closer parallels with jazz: \"They deliberately try to avoid clich\u00e9 and standard forms for the sake of the song ... Rock bands don't do that. It's far more like a jazz mentality.\"", "The electronic music of Kid A and Amnesiac was inspired by Yorke's admiration for Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin; in 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. Kid A also samples early computer music. 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood's interest in 20th-century classical music also had a role, as the influence of composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen was apparent. Since the recording of Kid A, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument popularised by Messiaen. Recording In Rainbows, Radiohead mentioned rock, electronic, hip hop and experimental musicians as influences, including Bj\u00f6rk, M.I.A, Liars, Modeselektor and Spank Rock. In 2011, Yorke denied that Radiohead had set out to make \"experimental music\", saying they were \"constantly absorbing music\" and that a variety of musicians are always influencing their work.", "Yorke is Radiohead's principal songwriter and lyricist. Songs usually begin as a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the rest of the band develop their parts. Arrangement is a collaborative effort, with all members having roles in the process. While Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts, O'Brien often creates ambient effects, making extensive use of effects units. The band often try several approaches to songs, and may develop them over years; for example, Radiohead first performed \"True Love Waits\" in 1995 before releasing it in a different arrangement on A Moon Shaped Pool in 2016. Greenwood said he saw Radiohead as \"just a kind of an arrangement to form songs using whatever technology suits the song. And that technology can be a cello or it can be a laptop. It's all sort of machinery when looked at in the right way.\" Yorke dismissed accusations that Radiohead make \"depressing\" music, saying in 2004: \"They just don't get it. Depressing music to me is just shit music. It's like air freshener \u2013 just a nasty little poison in the air.\"", "The Kid A and Amnesiac sessions brought a change in Radiohead's music and working methods. Since their shift from conventional rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played ondes Martenot, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulation, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 sessions for Hail to the Thief led to a different dynamic, with Yorke saying his power in the band had been \"absolutely unbalanced\" and that he would \"subvert everybody else's power at all costs. But\u00a0... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy-wise.\"", "Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide by 2011.Jonathan, Emma. \"BBC Worldwide takes exclusive Radiohead performance to the world\"  (press release).

The group had nearly completed four songs: \"Electioneering\", \"No Surprises\", \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"The Tourist\". They took a break from recording to embark on an American tour in 1996, opening for Alanis Morissette, performing early versions of several new songs.", "Yorke said that the starting point for the record was the \"incredibly dense and terrifying sound\" of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: \"It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core of what we were trying to do with OK Computer.\" Yorke identified \"I'll Wear It Proudly\" by Elvis Costello, \"Fall on Me\" by R.E.M., \"Dress\" by PJ Harvey and \"A Day in the Life\" by the Beatles as particularly influential on his songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as \"abusing the recording process\". Jonny Greenwood described OK Computer as a product of being \"in love with all these brilliant records ... trying to recreate them, and missing\".", "According to Yorke, Radiohead hoped to achieve an \"atmosphere that's perhaps a bit shocking when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds\". They expanded their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, cello and other strings, glockenspiel and electronic effects. Jonny Greenwood summarised the exploratory approach as \"when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it.\" Spin characterised OK Computer as sounding like \"a DIY electronica album made with guitars\".", "The songs of OK Computer do not have a coherent narrative, and the album's lyrics are generally considered abstract or oblique. Nonetheless, many musical critics, journalists, and scholars consider the album to be a concept album or song cycle, or have analysed it as a concept album, noting its strong thematic cohesion, aesthetic unity, and the structural logic of the song sequencing.Conversely, other critics have also argued that OK Computer is a concept album only in part, or in a nontraditional or qualified sense, or is not a concept album at all. See Letts 2010, pp. 28\u201332 Although the songs share common themes, Radiohead have said they do not consider OK Computer a concept album and did not intend to link the songs through a narrative or unifying concept while it was being written. Jonny Greenwood said: \"I think one album title and one computer voice do not make a concept album. That's a bit of a red herring.\" However, the band intended the album to be heard as a whole, and spent two weeks ordering the track list. O'Brien said: \"The context of each song is really important\u00a0... It's not a concept album but there is a continuity there.\"", "\"Let Down\" contains multilayered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano. Jonny Greenwood plays his guitar part in a different time signature to the other instruments. O'Brien said the song was influenced by Phil Spector, a producer and songwriter best known for his reverberating \"Wall of Sound\" recording techniques. The lyrics, Yorke said, are about a fear of being trapped, and \"about that feeling that you get when you're in transit but you're not in control of it\u2014you just go past thousands of places and thousands of people and you're completely removed from it\". Of the line \"Don't get sentimental / It always ends up drivel\", Yorke said: \"Sentimentality is being emotional for the sake of it. We're bombarded with sentiment, people emoting. That's the Let Down. Feeling every emotion is fake. Or rather every emotion is on the same plane whether it's a car advert or a pop song.\" Yorke felt that scepticism of emotion was characteristic of Generation X and that it had informed the band's approach to the album.", "\"Karma Police\" has two main verses that alternate with a subdued break, followed by a different ending section. The verses centre around acoustic guitar and piano, with a chord progression indebted to the Beatles' \"Sexy Sadie\". Starting at 2:34, the song transitions into an orchestrated section with the repeated line \"For a minute there, I lost myself\". It ends with guitarist Ed O'Brien generating feedback using a delay effect. The title and lyrics to \"Karma Police\" originate from an in-joke during The Bends tour; Jonny Greenwood said \"whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way, we'd say 'The karma police will catch up with him sooner or later.'\"", "\"Climbing Up the Walls\" \u2013 described by Melody Maker as \"monumental chaos\" \u2013 is layered with a string section, ambient noise and repetitive, metallic percussion. The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by modern classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima. Greenwood said, \"I got very excited at the prospect of doing string parts that didn't sound like 'Eleanor Rigby', which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years.\" Select described Yorke's distraught vocals and the atonal strings as \"Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo\". For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the Care in the Community policy of deinstitutionalising mental health patients, and a New York Times article about serial killers. He said:", "The album ends with \"The Tourist\", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where something \"doesn't have to happen\u00a0... every three seconds\". He said, \"'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It has become a song with space.\" The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it was chosen as the closing track because \"a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast and not being able to keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I needed to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down.\" The \"unexpectedly bluesy waltz\" draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.", "The title OK Computer is taken from the 1978 Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, in which the character Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase \"Okay, computer, I want full manual control now.\" The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. \"OK Computer\" became a working title for the B-side \"Palo Alto\", which had been considered for inclusion on the album.

Yorke, who had the greatest control, was still facing writer's block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Yorke's lack of lyrics created problems, as these had provided points of reference and inspiration for his bandmates in the past.", "The group struggled with Yorke's new direction. According to Yorke, Godrich \"didn't understand why, if we had such a strength in one thing, we would want to do something else. But at the same time he trusted me to have an idea of what I wanted.\" Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood feared \"awful art-rock nonsense just for its own sake\"; his brother, Colin, did not enjoy Yorke's Warp influences, finding them \"really cold\". Colin, O'Brien and drummer Philip Selway had \"major dilemmas\" wondering how to contribute, and considered \"walking away\". O'Brien said: \"It's scary\u00a0\u2013 everyone feels insecure. I'm a guitarist and suddenly it's like, well, there are no guitars on this track, or no drums.\"", "Radiohead worked on the first track, \"Everything in its Right Place\", in a conventional band arrangement in Copenhagen and Paris, but without results. In Gloucestershire, Yorke and Godrich transferred the song to a Prophet-5 synthesiser, and Yorke's vocals were processed in Pro Tools using a scrubbing tool. O'Brien and Selway said the track helped them accept that not every song needed every band member to play on it. O'Brien recalled: \"To be genuinely sort of delighted that you'd been working for six months on this record and something great has come out of it, and you haven't contributed to it, is a really liberating feeling.\" Jonny Greenwood described it as a turning point for the album: \"We knew it had to be the first song, and everything just followed after it.\"", "The strings on \"How To Disappear Completely\" were performed by the Orchestra of St John's and recorded in Dorchester Abbey, a 12th-century church about five miles from Radiohead's Oxfordshire studio. Radiohead chose the orchestra as they had performed pieces by Penderecki and Messiaen. Jonny Greenwood, the only Radiohead member trained in music theory, composed the string arrangement by multitracking his ondes Martenot. According to Godrich, when the musicians saw Greenwood's score \"they all just sort of burst into giggles, because they couldn't do what he'd written, because it was impossible\u00a0\u2013 or impossible for them, anyway\". The orchestra leader John Lubbock encouraged the musicians to experiment and work with Greenwood's ideas. Concerts director Alison Atkinson said the session was \"more experimental\" than the orchestra's usual bookings.", " \"Idioteque\" samples two computer music pieces, Paul Lansky's \"Mild Und Leise\" and Arthur Kreiger's \"Short Piece\". Both samples were taken from Electronic Music Winners, a 1976 experimental music LP which Jonny Greenwood stumbled upon while the band was working on Kid A. The track was built from a drum machine pattern Greenwood created with a modular synthesiser and a sample from \"Mild und Leise\". He gave the 50-minute recording to Yorke, who took a short section of it and used it to write the song. Yorke also referred to electronic dance music when talking about \"Idioteque\", and said that the song was \"an attempt to capture that exploding beat sound where you're at the club and the PA's so loud, you know it's doing damage\".", "The string orchestration for \"How to Disappear Completely\" was influenced by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki. Jonny Greenwood's use of the ondes Martenot on this and several other Kid A songs was inspired by Olivier Messiaen, who popularised the instrument and was one of Greenwood's teenage heroes. Greenwood described his interest in mixing old and new music technology, and during the recording sessions Yorke read Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head, which chronicles the Beatles' recordings with George Martin during the 1960s. The band also sought to combine electronic manipulations with jam sessions in the studio, stating their model was the German group Can.", "Radiohead also performed three concerts in North American theatres, their first in nearly three years. The small venues sold out rapidly, attracting celebrities, and fans camped overnight. In October, Radiohead performed on the American TV show Saturday Night Live; the performance shocked viewers expecting rock songs, with Jonny Greenwood playing electronic instruments, the house brass band improvising over \"The National Anthem\", and Yorke dancing erratically to \"Idioteque\". Rolling Stone described the Kid A tour as \"a revelation, exposing rock and roll humanity\" in the songs. In November 2001, Radiohead released I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, comprising performances from the Kid A and Amnesiac tours.", "Radiohead denied that they had set out to create \"difficult\" music. Jonny Greenwood argued that the tracks were short and melodic, and suggested that \"people basically want their hands held through 12 'Mull Of Kintyre's\". Yorke said: \"We're actually trying to communicate but, somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people\u00a0... What we're doing isn't that radical.\" He recalled that the band had been \"white as a sheet\" before early performances on the Kid A tour, thinking they had been \"absolutely trashed\". At the same time, the reaction motivated them: \"There was a sense of a fight to convince people, which was actually really exciting.\" He regretted having released no singles, feeling it meant much of the early judgement of the album came from critics.", "** Jonny Greenwood\u00a0\u2013 scoring"]}, {"page": "Amnesiac (album)", "response": ["The sessions drew influence from electronic music, 20th-century classical music, jazz and krautrock, using synthesisers, ondes Martenot, drum machines, strings and brass.

Lyttelton agreed to perform on the song with his band after his daughter showed him Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer. According to Lyttelton, Radiohead \"didn't want it to sound like a slick studio production but a slightly exploratory thing of people playing as if they didn't have it all planned out in advance\". The song was recorded over seven hours, and left Lyttelton exhausted. \"I detected some sort of eye-rolling at the start of the session, as if to say we were miles apart,\" he said. \"They went through quite a few nervous breakdowns during the course of it all, just through trying to explain to us all what they wanted.\"", "* Jonny Greenwood"]}, {"page": "The Bends (album)", "response": ["Work began at RAK Studios in London in February 1994.
