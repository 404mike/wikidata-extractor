She was married to John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan, and thus was the Countess of Buchan. \nAfter Robert the Bruce killed John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries, the Earl of Buchan joined the English side in the Scottish Wars of Independence. Isabella took the contrary view. \nAccording to tradition, the ceremony of crowning the monarch was performed by a representative of Clan MacDuff, but Isabella, Lady Buchan, arrived in Scone the day after the coronation of Robert the Bruce in March 1306. However, the Bruce agreed to be crowned for a second time the day after, as otherwise some would see the ceremony as irregular, not being performed by a MacDuff. \nBruce was defeated at the Battle of Methven in June 1306, so he sent Isabella and his female relatives north, but they were betrayed to the English by Uilleam II, Earl of Ross. Edward I of England ordered her sent to Berwick-upon-Tweed with these instructions: \"Let her be closely confined in an abode of stone and iron made in the shape of a cross, and let her be hung up out of doors in the open air at Berwick, that both in life and after her death, she may be a spectacle and eternal reproach to travellers.\"Lady Buchan was imprisoned in this cage for four years, then moved to the Carmelite friary at Berwick.  This was not necessarily a humanitarian move; it is suggested that by this stage Bruce was gaining support, his female relatives were potentially valuable hostages, and the English did not want them to die of ill-treatment.  The last clear mention of Lady Buchan is of her being transferred again in 1313, her eventual fate being uncertain.  Most of Bruce's female relatives returned to Scotland in early 1315, when they were exchanged for English noblemen captured after the Battle of Bannockburn, but there is no mention of her in the records, so she had probably died by then.Mary Bruce was treated in a similar fashion at Roxburgh Castle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward I of England", "response": ["Edward acted with unusual brutality against Bruce's family, allies, and supporters.

However, all the refugees who entered the castle were taken prisoner by its formerly pro-English governor Walter fitz Gilbert who, like many Lowland knights, declared for Bruce as soon as word came of the Scottish King's victory. Humphrey de Bohun was ransomed by Edward II, his brother-in-law, on the pleading of Edward's wife Isabella. This was one of the most interesting ransoms in English history.
