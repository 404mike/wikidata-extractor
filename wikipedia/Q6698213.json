Among the positive reviewers, Fiona Mountford wrote, \"\u201cRashbrook gives a marvellously restrained performance that hints at the unexplored depths of Stevens\u2019s soul, and he and Bradshaw, plus a top-notch ensemble, make easy work of the songs, many of which have a solemn and hymn-like feel. It\u2019s not all gloom, though, with the frothy music hall number 'The End of the Pier' to lighten the mood. A canny West End producer could do far worse than to tweak this fine show for a transfer.\u201dUnion Theatre, Remains of the Day. REVIEWS.  The What's On Stage review agreed, \"The songs are almost always well-integrated, intelligently written, and subtly performed. Although Loveless\u2019 adaptation does not quite pack what we feel is its potential punch, it does suggest a wealth of potential.\"  BroadwayWorld's review by Carrie Dunn observed, \"...some of this show works surprisingly well. This is pretty much entirely down to the touching, subtle performances of Stephen Rashbrook as butler Stevens and Lucy Bradshaw as housekeeper Miss Kenton. Both are compelling viewing, and work with the frequently limited (by necessity) material they have, endowing it with rich emotion.\"Dunn, Carrie.
