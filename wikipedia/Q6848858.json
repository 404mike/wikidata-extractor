Prior to 1980, only four countries qualified for the finals tournament, and Wales were drawn to play against the winners of Group 3 \u2013 Yugoslavia \u2013 in a two-legged, home-and-away tie. Wales lost the first leg 2\u20130 in Zagreb and were eliminated from the competition following a 1\u20131 draw in a bad-tempered return leg at Cardiff's Ninian Park, which was marred by crowd trouble. This initially led to Wales being banned from the 1980 tournament, but this was reduced on appeal to a four-year ban on qualifying matches being played within 100 miles of Cardiff. Yugoslavia went on to finish fourth in the 1976 tournament.", "Following the failure to qualify, Yorath's contract as manager of the national side was not renewed by the FAW, and Real Sociedad manager John Toshack was appointed on a part-time basis. However, Toshack resigned after just one match (a 3\u20131 defeat to Norway) citing problems with the FAW as his reason for leaving, although he was sure to have been shocked at being booed off the pitch at Ninian Park by the Welsh fans still reeling from the dismissal of Yorath.
