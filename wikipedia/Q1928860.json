For this finding, von Klitzing was awarded the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physics. A link between exact quantization and gauge invariance was subsequently proposed by Robert Laughlin, who connected the quantized conductivity to the quantized charge transport in a Thouless charge pump. Most integer quantum Hall experiments are now performed on gallium arsenide heterostructures, although many other semiconductor materials can be used. In 2007, the integer quantum Hall effect was reported in graphene at temperatures as high as room temperature, and in the magnesium zinc oxide ZnO\u2013MgxZn1\u2212xO."]}, {"page": "Cavendish Laboratory", "response": ["# Sir Michael Pepper FRS, Kt, Honorary Professor of Pharmaceutical Science in the University of Otago, New Zealand"]}, {"page": "Huw Edwards", "response": ["Edwards has been critical of some England-based newspapers for printing stories dismissive of the use of the Welsh language. In 2020 he responded to comments in The Times written by scientist Michael Pepper in which it was suggested that his late colleague John Meurig Thomas wrote notes in Welsh purely to stop others from reading them; Edwards pointed out that Welsh speakers do not \"use our native language in our daily lives simply to thwart others\". In 2021 he criticised former journalist Max Hastings for claiming that the Welsh language was of \"marginal value\" and that Wales could not succeed as an independent country because it was \"dependent on English largesse\"."]}, {"page": "Royal Society Bakerian Medal", "response": ["*2004 Michael Pepper, Semiconductor nanostructures and new quantum effects"]}, {"page": "2006 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Professor Michael Pepper, Professor of Physics, University of Cambridge.
