From this collection, he created a series of revelatory books unfolding the history of the Russian Revolution, and its associated art and propaganda. King developed a special interest in Leon Trotsky and the subsequent doctoring of revolutionary photos and records. Part of King's collection is housed on the fourth floor of Tate Modern, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Satire", "response": ["Karl Kraus is considered the first major European satirist since Jonathan Swift.Knight, Charles A. (2004) Literature of Satire p.254 In 20th-century literature, satire was used by English authors such as Aldous Huxley (1930s) and George Orwell (1940s), which under the inspiration of Zamyatin's Russian 1921 novel We, made serious and even frightening commentaries on the dangers of the sweeping social changes taking place throughout Europe. Anatoly Lunacharsky wrote \u2018Satire attains its greatest significance when a newly evolving class creates an ideology considerably more advanced than that of the ruling class, but has not yet developed to the point where it can conquer it. Herein lies its truly great ability to triumph, its scorn for its adversary and its hidden fear of it. Herein lies its venom, its amazing energy of hate, and quite frequently, its grief, like a black frame around glittering images. Herein lie its contradictions, and its power.\u2019David King & Cathy Porter 'Blood & Laughter: Caricatures from the 1905 Revolution' Jonathan Cape 1983 p.31  Many social critics of this same time in the United States, such as Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken, used satire as their main weapon, and Mencken in particular is noted for having said that \"one horse-laugh is worth ten thousand syllogisms\" in the persuasion of the public to accept a criticism. Novelist Sinclair Lewis was known for his satirical stories such as Main Street (1920), Babbitt (1922), Elmer Gantry (1927; dedicated by Lewis to H. L. Menchen), and It Can't Happen Here (1935), and his books often explored and satirized contemporary American values. The film The Great Dictator (1940) by Charlie Chaplin is itself a parody of Adolf Hitler; Chaplin later declared that he would have not made the film if he had known about the concentration camps.Chaplin (1964) My Autobiography, p.392, quotation: "]}, {"page": "Electric Ladyland", "response": ["*David King \u2013 UK album sleeve design"]}, {"page": "David King", "response": ["*David King (theatre producer) (born 1956), British theatre producer", "*David King (drummer) (born 1970), American drummer for Happy Apple and The Bad Plus", "*David King (chemist) (born 1939), British chemist, former chief scientific adviser to the UK government", "*David King (defensive back) (born 1963), American football player", "*David King (Australian rules footballer) (born 1972), Australian rules footballer for the North Melbourne Football Club", "*David King (punter) (born 1981), American football player from Australia ", "*David King (figure skater) (born 1984), British figure skater", "*David King (footballer, born 1985), Australian rules footballer for the Collingwood Football Club", "*David King (defensive end) (born 1989), American football player", "*David King (cricketer) (born 1990), Australian cricketer", "*David King (footballer, born 1990), English footballer", "*David King (hurler) (born 1993), Irish hurler", "*David King (hurdler) (born 1994), English hurdler", "*David King (graphic designer) (1943\u20132016), British graphic designer, historian, book author, collector of Soviet art", "*David King (historian) (born 1970), American writer and historian", "*David King (Resident Evil), a fictional video game character", "*David King, a character in the novel The Enemy", "*David King, a character in the multiplayer video game Dead by Daylight"]}, {"page": "Criticism of communist party rule", "response": ["There is a well-known literature focusing on the role of the falsification of images in the Soviet Union under Stalin.
