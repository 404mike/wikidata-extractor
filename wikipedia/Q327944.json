The dating of the parts of the collection is confusing but the bulk of it was put together before 1860. Although the collection was damaged, and substantial portions of it have been lost, it remains a very large insect collection. The bulk of the material collected by Haliday himself is in the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera. The undamaged Hymenoptera material is laid out in numbered blocks of systematised taxa, usually disparate groups (representing species) disposed below the appropriate generic name. Most of Haliday's specimens are from Ireland, however several of them are from England, Scotland, and Italy. In addition to the specialist collections of Hymenoptera and Diptera, there is Haliday's own general collection (mainly Coleoptera), and a large body of material added to the collection by other entomologists. The largest single source of donations to the collection was Francis Walker, the London entomologist with whom Haliday had a career-long association. The Walker addition was made up mostly of Hymenoptera and Diptera insects, however it contained insects of most other orders, especially Coleoptera and Thysanoptera. Other collectors represented are John Curtis, James Charles Dale, Jean Antoine Dours, Arnold F\u00f6rster or Foerster, Hermann Loew, Fernandino Maria Piccioli, G.T.Rudd, William Wilson Saunders, JamesFrancis Stephens, and Thomas Vernon Wollaston.
