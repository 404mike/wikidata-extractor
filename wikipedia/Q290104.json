Mr Hicks, who was in his forty-eighth year, was the son of the late Dr John Braxton Hicks, the famous obstetric surgeon, and was called to the Bar in Trinity term, 1875. For some time he was special pleader on the Western Circuit and at the Middlesex Sessions. Prior to his appointment as coroner seventeen years ago he was deputy coroner for the City of London and borough of Southwark, the City of Westminster, and the West London District. He had for some years been hon. Secretary of the Coroners' Society of England and Wales. Mr Hicks held many notable inquests, including the Pimlico poisoning case, the case in which a clergyman sent the dead body of a child to Sir William Harcourt, the then Home Secretary, to call his attention to the local burial scandal; the murder of Miss Camp on the South-Western Railway, the murder of Mr Pearson on the South-Western Railway, and the cancer case at Battersea. Mr Hicks held his last inquest at Lambeth on Saturday week, when he complained of the chilliness of the court, and two days previous to that he had a long sitting at Battersea to conclude the case in which a Lincolnshire farmer was alleged to have ill-treated his wife. He will be greatly missed by the poor, for whose benefit he had a fund and a clothes-box, and no needy person ever came before him without being assisted. Recently he was instrumental in inducing the Home Secretary to issue a public warning to parents on the subject of fireguards, and in not a few instances he has supplied them to poor people at his own expense. He never allowed an act of bravery to go unrewarded. To some extent the marked diminution in cases of baby-farming is due to Mr Hicks's searching inquiries, while he was also in a great measure responsible for the licensing of small boats and the alteration in the law restricting the sale of carbolic acid. Mr Hicks leaves a widow and a son and daughter."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* John Braxton Hicks (1823-1897), doctor and obstrecian"]}]}}
