However, in February 1964 a law firm representing James Bond movie producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli demanded an end to the use of Fleming's name in connection with the series and an end to the use of the name and character \"Solo\", \"Napoleon Solo\" and \"Mr. Solo\". At that time filming was underway for the Bond movie Goldfinger, in which Martin Benson was playing a supporting character named \"Mr. Solo\", being an American Mafia boss murdered by Auric Goldfinger. The claim was the name \"Solo\" had been sold to them by Fleming, and Fleming could not use it again. Within five days Fleming had signed an affidavit that nothing in the Solo pilot infringed any of his Bond characters, but the threat of legal action resulted in a settlement in which the name Napoleon Solo could be kept but the title of the show had to change."]}, {"page": "The King and I", "response": ["| The Kralahome ||The King's prime minister ||John Juliano|| Martin Benson, Saeed Jaffrey, Randall Duk Kim, Ho Yi, Paul Nakauchi, Takao Osawa", "The original London production opened on October 8, 1953, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and was warmly received by both audiences and critics;\"King and I wins London ovation\", The New York Times, October 9, 1953, p. 53.
