He was the first studio drummer of Siouxsie and the Banshees. He joined the band in January 1977; he had attended their first live appearance at the 100 Club a few months earlier and had been impressed by their performance. Morris's first studio recording with the group was in November 1977 when they recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio. Music journalist Kris Needs said : \"Like as a rhythm machine for feet and guts Kenny Morris' drumming is unorthodox, primitive (in a tribal sense) and far removed from the clicking hi-hats of the fly-strength paradiddle merchants\".He played mostly toms. He has been cited as a major influence by several drummers of the post-punk era including Stephen Morris of Joy Division, Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus, and  Paul Ferguson of Killing Joke.During the recording of the band's debut single \"Hong Kong Garden\", producer Steve Lillywhite suggested to him to record the drums separately. Morris did the bass drum and the snare drum first. He did the cymbals and the tom-toms later. Lillywhite also added echo on the drums, adding significant space to the entire recording. NME wrote that Lillywhite's work with Morris \"revolutionis[ed] the post-punk band's sound with an innovative approach to laying down the drums\".Morris played on the albums The Scream in 1978 and Join Hands. He left the band a few hours before a concert in Aberdeen at the beginning of the Join Hands tour, on 7 September 1979.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joy Division", "response": ["Sumner wrote that Curtis was inspired by artists such as the Doors, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Kraftwerk, the Velvet Underground and Neu!. Hook has also related that Curtis was particularly influenced by Iggy Pop's stage persona. The group were inspired by Kraftwerk's \"marriage between humans and machines\", and the inventiveness of their electronic music. Joy Division played Trans-Europe Express through the PA before they went on stage, \"to get a momentum\". Bowie's \"Berlin Trilogy\" elaborated with Brian Eno, influenced them; the \"cold austerity\" of the synthesisers on the b-sides of Heroes and Low albums, was a \"music looking at the future\". Morris cited the \"unique style\" of Velvet Underground's Maureen Tucker and the motorik drum beats, from Neu! and Can. Morris also credited Siouxsie and the Banshees because their \"first drummer Kenny Morris played mostly toms\" and \"the sound of cymbals was forbidden\". Hook said that \"Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of our big influences ... The way the guitarist and the drummer played was a really unusual way of playing\". Hook drew inspiration from the style of bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel and his early material with the Stranglers; he also credited Carol Kaye and her musical basslines on early 1970s work of the Temptations. Sumner mentioned \"the raw, nasty, unpolished edge\" in the guitars of the Rolling Stones, the simple riff of \"Vicious\" on Lou Reed's Transformer, and Neil Young. His musical horizon went up a notch with Jimi Hendrix, he realised \"it wasn't about little catchy tunes ... it was what you could do sonically with a guitar.\""]}, {"page": "Siouxsie and the Banshees", "response": ["While the band intended to split up after the gig, they were asked to play again. Over the next few months, Siouxsie and Severin recruited drummer Kenny Morris - and guitarist Peter Fenton. After playing several gigs in early 1977, they realised that Fenton did not fit in because he was \"a real rock guitarist\". John McKay finally took his place in July. Their first live appearance on television took place in November on Manchester's  Granada, on Tony Wilson's TV show So It Goes. That month they also recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio in which they premiered a new song \"Metal Postcard\", introducing a \"motorik austerity\" in the drums patterns, with \"the space in the sound\" and \"the serrated guitars\". The band described their music as \"cold, machine-like and passionate at the same time\". When they appeared on the cover of Sounds magazine, Vivien Goldman wrote: \"they sound like a 21st century industrial plant\".", "Joy Division's Peter Hook, who saw the group in concert in Manchester in 1977, said: \"Siouxsie and the Banshees were one of our big influences [...] The Banshees first LP was one of my favourite ever records, the way the guitarist and the drummer played was a really unusual way of playing and this album showcases a landmark performance\". Joy Division drummer Stephen Morris was influenced by the Banshees Mk1 from their 1977's John Peel session because their \"first drummer Kenny Morris played mostly toms\" and \"the sound of cymbals was forbidden\". He added, \"The Banshees had that [...] foreboding sound, sketching out the future from the dark of the past\". Joy Division producer Martin Hannett saw a difference between the Banshees' first main lineup and the other bands of 1977: \"Any harmonies you got were stark, to say the least, except for the odd exception, like Siouxsie. They were interesting\". The Cure's leader, Robert Smith, declared in 2003: \"Siouxsie and the Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something.\" He also pinpointed what the 1979 Join Hands tour brought him musically. \"On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing\"."]}, {"page": "Robert Smith (musician)", "response": ["Robert Smith met Steven Severin of Siouxsie and the Banshees at a Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire gig at the London YMCA on 3 August 1979.Thompson, Dave & Jo-Ann Greene.
