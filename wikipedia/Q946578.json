Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from London or were in the process of opening, and temporarily became London's main burial grounds. A proposal by Francis Seymour Haden to ship the bodies of London's dead to the Thames Estuary for use in land reclamation met with little approval, and the government sought alternative means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds."]}, {"page": "John Callcott Horsley", "response": ["Horsley remarried to Rosamund Haden who came from a family of distinguished surgeons\u2014her father Charles Haden had a practice in Sloan Street and her brother Francis Seymour Haden was a surgeon and etcher who founded the Royal Society of Painters, Etchers and Engravers in 1880.

This made the lines on the plates much more durable, and in particular the fragile \"burr\" thrown up by the drypoint process lasted much better than with copper alone, and so a greater (if still small) number of rich, burred, impressions could be produced.  Francis Seymour Haden and his brother-in-law, the American James McNeill Whistler were among the first to exploit this, and drypoint became a more popular technique than it had been since the 15th century, still often combined with conventional etching.  However, steel-facing could lead to a loss of quality.Mayor, 125; Griffiths, 71, 76, 154-155  It is not to be confused with steel engraving on wholly iron plates, popular in the same period but almost always for mezzotints and commercial printing.Griffiths, 154 ", "For Hamerton and others, the father of the British Etching Revival was Francis Seymour Haden, the surgeon etcher, who, with his brother-in-law, the American, James McNeill Whistler, produced a body of work starting around 1860 that still stands as one of the highpoints of etching history.  Haden was a collector and authority on the etchings of Rembrandt and it comes as no surprise that as Whistler, the younger man, began to show signs of veering far from the 17th-century model, Haden and he parted company.
