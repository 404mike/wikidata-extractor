Two weeks after the Wales match, Burge was part of the Australian team that faced Cardiff, and was again sent from the pitch by referee Gil Evans after 'brutally' kicking Dai Westacott while the player was prone on the ground."]}, {"page": "Tom Evans (rugby union)", "response": ["Evans made his first international appearance for Wales in the final game of the 1906 Home Nations Championship. Wales had won the previous years Championship, and with victories already established over England and Scotland, a win against Ireland in the last encounter would give the country back-to-back Triple Crown seasons. Three changes were made to the team for the trip to Belfast, all in the forward positions and all three new caps; Evans and two Cardiff players, Dai Westacott and Jack Powell. The game ended in a disappointing loss for Wales, with poor selection decisions blamed. All three new caps found the strains of international rugby too much, and failed to last the pace."]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union players killed in World War I", "response": ["| || Dai Westacott || || ||27 August 1917 (35)"]}, {"page": "Westacott", "response": ["*Dai Westacott (1882-1917), Welsh international rugby union player"]}]}}
