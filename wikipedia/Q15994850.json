The legal status of pew rents was, in many cases, very questionable. Further, it exacerbated a problem with a lack of accommodation in churches, that had been noted already in the 1810s, especially in London, and in particular by Richard Yates in his pamphlet The Church in Danger (1815) with his estimate of over 950,000 people who could not worship in a parish church. St Philip's Clerkenwell, a Commissioners' church, was the first London church to break with pew rents."]}, {"page": "Richard Yates", "response": ["Richard Yates  may refer to:", "*Richard Yates (actor) (1706\u20131796), English comic actor", "*Richard Yates (antiquary) (1769\u20131834), English cleric", "*Richard Yates (politician, born 1815) (1815\u20131873), 13th Governor of Illinois (1861\u20131865), U.S. Senator from Illinois (1865\u20131871), U.S. Congressman from Illinois (1851\u20131855), member of Illinois House of Representatives (1842\u20131845, 1848\u20131849)", "**Richard Yates, Jr. (1860\u20131936), his son, 22nd Governor of Illinois (1901\u20131905), U.S. Congressman from Illinois (1919\u20131933)", "*Richard Yates (novelist) (1926\u20131992), American novelist and short-story writer", "*Richard Yates (athlete) (born 1986), English athlete", "*Richard Yates (novel), 2010 novel by Tao Lin"]}, {"page": "David Williams (philosopher)", "response": ["His will, dated 16 July 1814, left his papers to his executors, Richard Yates and Thomas Wittingham; his other property went to his niece and housekeeper, Mary Watkins (died 5 February 1845), who moved from Gerrard Street to Lower Sloane Street, and afterwards to King's Road, Chelsea."]}, {"page": "John Bowyer Nichols", "response": ["* History and Antiquities of the Abbey of St. Edmunds Bury by Richard Yates, second edition, London, 1843, 2 parts."]}]}}
