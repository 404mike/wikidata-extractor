Though the format remained mostly the same, the show was retooled, aiming for a more mature audience. The periodic table scheme remained, but the show was given a darker, more rustic color scheme. The number of videos shown was reduced from ten to eight. The audience insets were also eliminated, but the internet messages remained. It was at this time, also, that MWL experienced its first host change. Amber Mogg left CMT and Lance Smith was moved to the network's Top Twenty Countdown show. Katie Cook and Greg Martin replaced Smith and Mogg. As part of the move to Opry Mills, the show added a Saturday airing, to act as a lead-in to Opry Backstage, which itself was a lead-in to CMT's live coverage of the Grand Ole Opry. Another host change occurred with less fanfare in October 2002, when Greg Martin was released. He was quickly replaced by Cledus T. Judd, a face with which many country music fans were already familiar.", "On January 13, 2003, CMT launched MWL Star, an interview series focusing on one artist per episode. The series was hosted by Katie Cook. MWL Star ended its run on June 3, 2003 and its replacement, MWL Stacked, debuted the same day. Stacked is a thirty-minute show featuring wall-to-wall videos from a single artist or group. When MWL was canceled, MWL Stacked became known as CMT Stacked, and it remains on the air sporadically ."]}, {"page": "Catherine Cooke (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Katie Cook (country music), English actress and television host", "*Katie Cook (writer) (born 1981), American comic artist and writer"]}, {"page": "CMT Hot Twenty", "response": ["* Katie Cook (2013\u2013present) "]}, {"page": "Nashville (season 2)", "response": ["* Katie Cook as herself"]}, {"page": "Whole World", "response": ["*\"Whole World\", Reno, Katie Cook, 2000"]}, {"page": "2021 CMT Music Awards", "response": ["* Cody Alan, Katie Cook and Ashley ShahAhmadi"]}, {"page": "Katie Cook (actress)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Katie Cook (country music)"]}]}}
