He began his career with Aberdeen, and initially played for Dundee United on loan in 2016 before joining St Mirren. He rejoined Dundee United permanently in 2019, and was on loan to Irish club Dundalk in 2020. After brief stints with Ayr United and Indy Eleven, Smith joined Partick Thistle in July 2021.

He pounced on a mistake by goalkeeper Alan Mannus and defender Frazer Wright, leaving Hayes with the easy task of firing into the empty net, before celebrating in front of the travelling Aberdeen support. On 15 September, he provided an assist for Cammy Smith to equalise against his old club, Inverness, in the dying minutes. The game finished 1\u20131.", "In a 4\u20130 win over St Johnstone in the League Cup semi-final at Tynecastle, Hayes scored twice to help send the Dons into their first major cup final for 14 years. A poor goal kick by Steve Banks allowed Adam Rooney to square the ball across the six-yard box for Hayes to knock into the net. Clever footwork by the winger late in the second half led to a fine finish just inside the 18-yard box to wrap up the match and send Aberdeen through to the final. Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster's run of clean sheets (13 games) was finally ended on 1,256 minutes on 25 February 2014 when Hayes beat him from 30 yards to open the scoring in a 2\u20131 win for The Dons. The goal was later voted as the SPFL Goal of the Season. On 16 March 2014, Hayes started for Aberdeen in the League Cup Final but early on he suffered a shoulder injury and had to be replaced by Cammy Smith."]}, {"page": "Balmedie", "response": ["There are four small play parks in Balmedie there are also two full-sized football pitches where amateur side Trophies International play their home matches.
