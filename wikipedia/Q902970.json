He finally made his first start for the club in a 2\u20132 draw with Middlesbrough on 16 March, in place of Buxton, and kept it for the rest of the season as Derby successfully fought off relegation. Anderson scored his first goal for Derby County, and his first in three years, on 17 April 2010 with the opener in a 1\u20131 draw against Crystal Palace which ensured Derby were mathematically safe from relegation. Anderson impressed enough for Derby manager Nigel Clough to confirm his intention to offer Anderson a two-year deal at the end of the 2009\u201310 season, seeing Anderson as one of four centre halves for the club's 2010\u201311 season alongside Barker, Buxton and Dean Leacock.

Upon returning to the side for a 3\u20130 win over Millwall at the end of September, Anderson played a role in seven of Derby's next eight games, often employed at right-back in the absence of first choice John Brayford.

However, a Steve Howard header in a 1\u20130 win at Wolves on 12 September 2006 proved a catalyst as the club lost only 4 of its next 27 fixtures (a run which included winning all 6 league fixtures in November 2006 and an 8 match winning streak, 6 league, 2 FA Cup, from 30 December 2006 up until 10 February 2007).

The run was ended with a 5\u20130 thrashing of Crystal Palace on 25 September 2010.

The defeats continued throughout the month, with a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Reading, the postponement due to snow of a home fixture against Doncaster Rovers and a 5\u20132 humbling away to local rivals Nottingham Forest meant Derby failed to take a solitary point from December's four fixtures and dropped to 12th in the table on the back of their worst sequence of results for three years. The Forest result saw Clough's patience snap with his playing staff, singling out Dean Leacock and Paul Green as \"offering nothing\", saying \"We get to the stage where we give the players every opportunity but at some point you have to move on to the next group.

Dean Leacock, heavily criticised as \"offering nothing\" the previous game, was dropped to the bench, and Stephen Pearson, Conor Doyle and a returning Robbie Savage introduced into the midfield. Two enforced changes came with Gareth Roberts replacing the suspended Dean Moxey and Chris Porter making his first start of the league campaign as a replacement for Luke Moore, who returned to W.B.A. on the completion of his three-month loan. In the event, the changes earned Derby a first win in 6 as a Porter double sealed a 2\u20131 win at the division's bottom club.

It's as if they're waiting for a mistake to get on our backs.\" However, the club's slight revival was undermined by a giant killing at the hands of non-league Crawley in the FA Cup third round, described by reporters as one of the \"biggest FA Cup shocks of all time\" and others as the most \"humiliating result in Derby County's history\".

I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with Derby and I want to walk away with my head held high.\" One fan responded by telephoning Savage during an interview on Radio Five Live and telling him to \"leave the club now\" and \"take young Mr. Clough with him.\" Savage eventually rejected the move, stating it was too big a move for his family.

There was also pressure on Clough, who was criticised by PFA Chief Gordon Taylor after comments he made about Tomasz Cwyka following a 1\u20131 draw at Portsmouth. Of Cywka, Clough said \"He's an extremely inexperienced and not very bright footballer\u00a0... he can go back to Wigan or wherever he came from \u2013 I'm not really bothered \u2013 until he learns the game.\" This led Taylor to state that \"It cannot be appropriate to criticise your team in such a way in public.

A loan deal which would have seen Dean Leacock move to Hull City for the remainder of the campaign also fell through. In terms of incoming deals, Matt Duke arrived on a season long loan from Hull City. The move for Duke proved to be a preemptive measure, as Frank Fielding's loan from Blackburn Rovers, which the club revealed was with a view to a permanent deal, would run out at the end of March, and not the end of the campaign as previously suggested, due to the 93-day emergency loan rule.
