He lasted 22 months in the job, before he was sacked in September 2004.

After leaving Brisbane Road, Turner was appointed as reserve team coach at Leicester City by manager Mark McGhee, and later moved with McGhee to Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he was appointed youth-team coach."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 in English football", "response": ["7 February 1995 \u2013 Leyton Orient co-manager John Sitton takes the bizarre move of sacking defender Terry Howard at half-time during a 1\u20130 defeat by Blackpool.", "20 April 1995 \u2013 New Leyton Orient owner Barry Hearn dismisses co-managers John Sitton and Chris Turner, and replaces them with Tottenham Hotspur coach Pat Holland.

Just before the end of the season, the Brisbane Road club was taken over by Barry Hearn, who was swift to sack joint managers John Sitton and Chris Turner, appointing Pat Holland in their place. Chester City suffered an instant return to Division Three as they finished second from bottom. Cardiff City went down to Division Three just two seasons after winning promotion.
