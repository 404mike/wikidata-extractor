The statutory notice of his application for citizenship was published in a Welsh newspaper so as not to alert the Germans.According to Ustinov in his biography Dear Me He was the controller of Wolfgang Gans zu Putlitz, an MI5 spy in the German embassy in London, who furnished information on Hitler's intentions before the Second World War.
