However, their opinions with respect to the Lord are quite similar to those of Cerinthus and Carpocrates. They use Matthew's gospel only, and repudiate the Apostle Paul, maintaining that he was an apostate from the Law.\" - Irenaeus, Haer 1.26.2 Eusebius of Caesarea wrote that they used only the Gospel of the Hebrews.Eusebius of Caesarea, Church History, III, 27, 4. From this, the minority view of James R. Edwards and Bodley's Librarian Edward Nicholson claim that there was only one Hebrew gospel in circulation, Matthew's Gospel of the Hebrews. They also note that the title Gospel of the Ebionites was never used by anyone in the early church.James R. Edwards, The Hebrew Gospel & the Development of the Synoptic Tradition, 2009 Wm. B.

Stebbing, The Life and Works of Flavius Josephus, reprinted Vol II, Kessinger Publishing, 2006. p. 576 Epiphanius contended that the gospel the Ebionites used was written by Matthew and called the \"Gospel of the Hebrews\".They too accept the Matthew's gospel, and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the Gospel of the Hebrews, for in truth Matthew alone in the New Testament expounded and declared the Gospel in Hebrew using Hebrew script. - Epiphanius, Panarion 30.3.7 Because Epiphanius said that it was \"not wholly complete, but falsified and mutilated\",Epiphanius, Panarion 30.13.1 writers such as Walter Richard Cassels and Pierson Parker consider it a different \"edition\" of Matthew's Hebrew Gospel;Walter Richard Cassels, Supernatural Religion - An Inquiry into the Reality of Divine Revelation, 1877 reprinted print on demand Read Books, 2010.
