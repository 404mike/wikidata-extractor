After beating Barry Town with an aggregate score 9\u20131, the team moved to the Champions League group stage after defeating Sparta Prague in a penalty shootout when both games ended 1\u20130 in favor of the away team. Dynamo were seeded against Arsenal, Racing Lens and Panathinaikos. The team lost its first game to Panathinaikos in Greece and then drew the home match with Lens, 1\u20131. Lobanovskyi's side then faced Arsenal at Wembley Stadium. In the second half, Andriy Shevchenko scored a goal that was cancelled due to offside. The replay, however, showed that the goal was valid. Instead, Dennis Bergkamp took Arsenal to the lead in the 72nd minute. In the 88th minute, Dynamo equalised after a strike from Serhiy Rebrov to the left corner of the net, and the match finished as a 1\u20131 draw.

Dynamo then defeated Panathinaikos in Kyiv thanks to an own goal from Angelos Basinas. Before the final match, Dynamo, Panathinaikos and Racing Lens had 8 points, while Arsenal earned only 6 points.
