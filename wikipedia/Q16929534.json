Allman established a distillery in a converted 18th Century mill, following the failure of the family's cotton manufacturing business. There is no record of any previous distillery operating in Bandon, nor is there any record of Allman having prior experience in distilling himself. A report at the time, showed that production between October 1826 and October 1827 totalled some 63,023 gallons. Thereafter, the distillery grew in capacity over time as profits from the initial years of operating were reinvested in the business, reaching a capacity of 200,000 per annum by 1836, and by the mid-1800s the distillery had become the largest rural distillery in Ireland, with a capacity in excess of 500,000 gallons per annum. By 1846, Richard Allman had succeeded to the business, and by 1881 it was owned by Richard and his brother James C. Allman (junior), in a partnership trading as \"Allman and Company\". When Alfred Barnard, a British historian visited the distillery in 1887, it had become a significant enterprise, with a payroll of about 200. Boasting its own private railway line, and with the largest malting floors in the United Kingdom aside from those at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, which were marginally larger, Allmans' and was said to be \"the most dominant landmark in rural Co. Cork\". According to Barnard, Allman's whiskey was of \"superior quality\", and although it enjoyed a large trade in Ireland, was chiefly exported to \"England, Scotland and the Colonies\". At the time, the firm produced both traditional Irish single pot still whiskey and pure malt whiskey.
