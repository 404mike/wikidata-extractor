He was articled to John Sherwood of Sheffield, and was admitted an attorney in January 1810. He practised in Manchester for over forty years, and was in partnership first with James Knight, then with James Grove, and finally with his son George. He spent many years  in litigation and controversy in connection with the alienation of Lady Hewley's and other charities. The dispute was finally resolved by the passing of the Dissenters' Chapels Act 1844 which he had played a part in framing. With Thomas Raffles and William Roby he established the Lancashire Independent College, first at Blackburn and then at Whalley Range, where in 1840 he laid the foundation-stone of the new building, and gave \u00a32000 towards the cost of the erection."]}, {"page": "Robert Moffat (missionary)", "response": ["Moffat was born of humble parentage in Ormiston, East Lothian. To find employment, he moved south to Cheshire in England as a gardener. In 1814, whilst employed at West Hall, High Legh in Cheshire he experienced difficulties with his employer due to his Methodist sympathies. For a short period, after having applied successfully to the London Missionary Society (LMS) to become an overseas missionary, he took an interim post as a farmer, at Plantation Farm in Dukinfield (where he first met Mary his future wife). The job had been found for him by William Roby, who took Moffat under his wing for a year."]}, {"page": "British Muslim Heritage Centre", "response": ["The college was built as an Independent (i.e. Congregational) college in 1840\u201343, the architects being Irwin and Chester. The site was in the new suburb whose development had been begun about 10 years earlier by Samuel Brooks; its name later became Whalley Range. The aim of the Lancashire Independent College was a project of the Lancashire Congregational Union to provide higher education for Non-Conformists who were excluded from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge until 1871. This included a new college building and moving the staff from Blackburn Academy which was then closed. The three founders were George Hadfield, Thomas Raffles and William Roby (minister of the Grosvenor Street Chapel, London Road, Manchester). The Blackburn Academy arose from courses of lessons given to prospective Congregational ministers by William Roby who was supported by the Manchester merchant Robert Spear. When the principal, Joseph Fletcher, left for London the academy became the Lancashire Independent College and moved to Manchester. The college became known much later as the Northern Congregational College."]}, {"page": "List of dissenting academies (19th century)", "response": ["|Blackburn Academy.
