While being equally comfortable playing at any of these positions, he prefers to play in a midfield role. He has also played in the hole and has given a composed performance as a second striker. His play as a right midfielder is \"skilful\" and he has been described as being \"comfortable on the ball, a good passer, mobile and with an eye for goal\". Stevenage Borough manager Graham Westley described him as a player \"who impresses me with his consistency\". After signing for York, manager Martin Foyle said \"He is a great all-rounder, a technically good footballer and has a very professional attitude towards the game.\" His partnership with Neil Barrett in the central midfield for York drew praise from teammate Richard Brodie, who said \"The midfield two worked really well together and picked up the second balls. Alex Lawless was flawless and he should be playing in the Football League\".", "After joining York City in 2009, Lawless moved into a house with teammates Neil Barrett, James Meredith, Richard Pacquette and Daniel Parslow.

After a run of entering three matches as a substitute, he started against Gateshead away and scored York's first goal with a 12-yard shot in a 2\u20131 victory. Brodie won a penalty against Crawley after being fouled by Dominic Collins, which he scored six minutes into the match, before passing the ball to Michael Gash, who scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 victory. Following the match, Foyle commented on their partnership, saying \"They are doing well together because Michael leads the line very well and Richard looks to hit the flanks.\" After receiving a yellow card in a home match with Oxford on 17 October 2009 for kicking the ball away, which was his fifth booking of the season, he was handed a one-match suspension for York's match against Luton Town. York claimed the booking was the result of mistaken identity, as Adam Smith was the player who committed the offence, and an appeal with the Football Association was lodged.
