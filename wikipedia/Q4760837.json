Hughes left The Orb during the production of Cydonia, which was reworked after his departure.  In 2009, he mastered the Orb's Baghdad Batteries (Orbsessions Volume III) for release.  He also did additional original production work and performed remixes for the Cranberries and Tangerine Dream. \nPrior to his Orb years he had helped to design and build the studios for Bunk Junk & Genius and worked with many famous artists.Andy Hughes died aged 43 of liver failure, at the Liver Intensive Care Unit at King's College Hospital in London, on 12 June 2009.

He made two high-profile errors in the pre-season match against Blackburn Rovers when he gave away a penalty and was very lucky not to give away a second penalty.

It was released on 27 February 2001 in the United Kingdom by Island Records and in the United States by MCA Records. Members Alex Paterson and Thomas Fehlmann, along with usual collaborators Andy Hughes, Nick Burton, and Simon Phillips, wrote and produced the album for a planned 1999 release.

With the album, the group, reunited with Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, returned to their spacy sounds typical of U.F.Orb (1992). Though Orblivion was recorded in May 1996, it was not released until almost a year later, due to Island Records' desire to promote it as a follow-up to U2's Pop."]}, {"page": "Orbus Terrarum", "response": ["Orbus Terrarum is the third studio album by English electronic music group The Orb, released on 20 March 1995 by Island Records. Member Kris Weston had begun work on the album before leaving the group; however, when he left, German producer Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member, and the group, now consisting of Alex Paterson, Andy Hughes, and Fehlmann, finished producing the album. Unlike their previous efforts, Orbus Terrarum features more \"earthbound\", \"organic\" sounds in contrast to the psychedelic, science fiction-themed music they had previously written."]}, {"page": "The Orb", "response": ["Beginning as ambient and dub DJs in London, The Orb's early performances were inspired by electronic artists of the 1970s, most notably Brian Eno, Cluster, and Kraftwerk. The Orb have maintained their signature science fiction aesthetic despite numerous personnel changes, including the departure of Cauty and members Kris Weston, Andy Falconer, Simon Phillips, Nick Burton, and Andy Hughes. Paterson has been the only permanent member, continuing to work as the Orb with Swiss-German producer Thomas Fehlmann, and later, with Martin \"Youth\" Glover, bassist of Killing Joke. Paterson's unauthorised use of other artists' works has led to multiple disputes, most notably with Rickie Lee Jones.", "Over the next year and a half, Paterson and Weston continued to produce \"new\" material, and the Orb left Big Life to sign a deal with Island Records. Their first release on Island Records was the live album Live 93, which gathered highlights from their recent performances in Europe and Asia. It featured the live crew of Paterson, Weston, producers Nick Burton and Simon Phillips, as well as audio engineer Andy Hughes, who had stepped in previously when Weston had decided to stop touring. The Orb's first studio production on Island Records was Pomme Fritz, a chaotic EP noted for its heavy use of strange samples and its lack of conventional harmonies. Though Pomme Fritz reached No.6 on the British charts, critics panned it as \"doodling\". Island Records \"hated it\" and \"didn't understand it at all\", according to Paterson. Soon after production finished on Pomme Fritz, Paterson, Weston, and Orb contributor Thomas Fehlmann joined with Robert Fripp to form the group FFWD as a side project. FFWD released a single self-titled album on Paterson's Inter-Modo label, which Fehlmann later described as \"an Orb track which became so long that it became a whole album!\". Due to this aimlessness, FFWD lacked an artistic goal and disbanded after a single release. Soon after the release of FFWD in August 1994, Weston suddenly left the Orb. Paterson claimed that Weston's departure was due to his desire to have more control in the Orb. In an interview with i-D, Weston attributed the split to Paterson, saying that Paterson \"didn't do his 50 per cent of the work\". Paterson reaffirmed the status of the Orb saying, \"The Orb is the Orb, and nothing can change that\", and continued work with Hughes and Fehlmann.", "Following Weston's departure from the Orb, Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member, but did not always participate in live performances. Paterson, Hughes, and Fehlmann then finished producing the album Orbus Terrarum, on which Paterson and Weston had been working. Orbus Terrarum, released in 1995, featured more \"earthbound\" and \"organic\" sounds than their previous trippy science-fiction-themed music. Orbus Terrarum suffered, as Paterson described it, \"a good kicking\" at the hands of the British press, who described it as \"generic\" and a low point for Paterson's creativity. Orbus Terrarum alienated many of the group's fans, and reached only No.20 on the British charts. (search for Orb albums) American critics gave it great acclaim, including Rolling Stone who made it their album of the month, citing its symphonic flow coupled with the Orb's \"uniquely British wit\". After a long world tour, the Orb, with Andy Hughes and Steve Hillage, settled down to produce their next album, Orblivion\u2014the process of which saw a return to their spacey sounds. Though Orblivion was recorded in May 1996, it was not released until almost a year later, due to Island Records' desire to promote it as a follow up to U2's techno-rock album Pop. Orblivion sold well in Europe as well as the United States, where it reached the Billboard Top 200. The first Orblivion single, \"Toxygene\", was the highest-charting single by the Orb, reaching No.4 in the United Kingdom on 8February 1997. Despite high sales, Orblivion received a lukewarm reception from the British press. As with Orbus Terrarum, Orblivion was better received by American critics, including Rolling Stone, who praised its \"contrast of chaos and euphony\". Meanwhile, the stresses of touring sat heavily on Paterson; he considered retiring the Orb, but continued touring and producing. In 1997 the band sold their studio Joe's Garage to the Godfrey brothers of Morcheeba.\"Sound On Sound Morcheeba studio 1997\" Sue Sillitoe, \"Morcheeba: From Clapham to The Orb\" Sound on Sound, December 1997 That same year, they contributed a cover of \"Jo the Waiter\" to the Gary Numan tribute album Random.", "The Orb began performing regularly at the Brixton Academy in the early 1990s, where they used the high ceilings and large space for their \"well-suited amorphous sound\", frequently performing their newest and more experimental pieces there. Andy Hughes took Weston's place at live performances after the 1993 tour, though Weston did reappear for the Orb's concert at the rainy Woodstock '94. The Orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of Woodstock '94 in addition to artists including Aphex Twin, Orbital, and Deee-Lite. The next year, the Orb's touring group consisted of Paterson, Hughes, Nick Burton on drums, and Simon Phillips on bass. This live setup created a \"cacophony\" of \"gigantic, swarming sounds\". Though the Orb's performances use much onstage equipment and many props, Paterson prefers to present them as \"a non-centralised figure of amusement on stage\"."]}, {"page": "Lo Presher", "response": ["After shunning interest from a variety of independent record labels, the band decided to create their own production company and formed Everything Records (EVREC) in 1995. Throughout the mid-nineties the band, acting as the production company, produced several showcases and events that promoted other up and coming bands and DJ's throughout the state of Florida (US). Earthvibe held in June 1995 at the Volusia County Fairgrounds in Daytona Beach, Florida helped to mark the early careers of such notable DJs as Andy Hughes, Chang, and DJ Sandy."]}, {"page": "Hughes (surname)", "response": ["*Andy Hughes (1965\u20132009), British music producer"]}]}}
