He made his league debut for the club alongside fellow new signing Paul France in the opening match of the 1990\u201391 campaign, a 2\u20132 draw against Lincoln City at Turf Moor. Bray kept his place for several matches before being dropped in favour of Ray Deakin, but regained the left-back berth towards the end of the season when the latter was unavailable through injury. He went on to make ten appearances during the following campaign, six of them in the league, before again being dropped for Joe Jakub. Bray played his final match for Burnley on 19 October 1991 in the 2\u20130 home win over Walsall.
