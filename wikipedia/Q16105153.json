He was promoted to the senior side in 1962 and played 26 matches as an amateur in the final year of amateur status in first-class cricket, scoring 651 runs at 17.59. He hit his highest score of 82 against Middlesex, when his 206-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Barry Knight equalled the Essex record. In assessing Essex's season, Wisden noted that Luckin \"batted well at times, though indifferent fielding lessened his value\".He played three first-class matches in 1963, and a few matches for the Essex Second XI in 1963 and 1964. He played for Cambridgeshire in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship from 1969 to 1972 with only moderate success.\nHe later served as a director of the accounting firm Moores Rowland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "RAG Luckin", "response": ["#REDIRECTRoger Luckin"]}]}}
