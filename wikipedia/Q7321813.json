Slovenia international Nejc Pe\u010dnik, who had been on trial at the club, signed on a two-year contract from Portuguese side Nacional. Pe\u010dnik is a winger who had played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup two-years previously. However, it was disappointing to hear that earlier that same day Sheffield Wednesday Academy manager Sean McAuley had left the club having been with the Owls since 2005. McAuley had gone over to America to become assistant manager at Major League Soccer club Portland Timbers. With a number of midfielder's in the Sheffield Wednesday squad Dave Jones decided to off-load promising youngster Liam Palmer on-loan to League One club Tranmere Rovers for a total of six-months. Palmer, a product of the Sheffield Wednesday Academy and a Scotland U-21 international, has scored one goal for the Owls and was a consistent starter at the early parts of the 2011\u201312 football league season. Wednesday played their first pre-season friendlies both at the same time, with manager Dave Jones sending out two different squads to the grounds of Sheffield F.C. and Stocksbridge Park Steels. A single goal by Chris O'Grady against Sheffield F.C. was not enough to earn a win and the game finished rightly as a draw, while a slightly stronger side beat Stocksbridge Park Steels 0\u20134. Two goals from Chris Maguire and one from Gary Madine and young trialist Patrick Antelmi saw the Owls get off to a good start in preparation to the pre-season tour in Portugal where the squad were due to fly to the next day. Sheffield Wednesday played their first game of two in Portugal after nearly a week of training their. The Owls went down 2\u20130 to a strong Sporting Lisbon side. Goals in either half saw off the Owls and was overall seen as a good workout in their preparation to the new season. Two days after this, Sheffield Wednesday were back at the Estadio Municipal de Albufeira to play Premier League side Reading, who had just been promoted from the Football League Championship. A goal either side of half-time from Mike Jones and Chris O'Grady saw Wednesday go out deserved 2\u20130 winners. After the win, the Owls came back to their training base in Sheffield. On 28 July 2012, Wednesday played their first game since getting back to England, a friendly against Doncaster Rovers, and with little chances from both teams the game finished a goalless draw. Back to the transfer market and the Owls revealed the new signing of Rhys McCabe on a free transfer after deciding not to join the new-co Rangers. The young attacking midfielder agreed a three-year deal with the club. However, the signing was over-shadowed by the leaving of club captain and fan favourite Rob Jones, who left via mutual consent and went on to join Doncaster Rovers just the very next day.", "On the Monday before the first home game against Birmingham City, Wednesday confirmed the signing of Rodrigo R\u00edos Lozano, also known as Rodri, on a season-long loan from Barcelona B. It is expected that the Owls have the option to buy Rodri on a permanent basis at the end of the season. Rodri made his debut for Wednesday just the next day when he started in the first home tie of the campaign against Birmingham City. After R\u00e9da Johnson put the Owls ahead due to a mistake from England goalkeeper Jack Butland, Rodri scored on his debut, after a brilliant solo effort. The first half ended with Wednesday two goals up. Nikola Zigic did pull back a goal for Birmingham in the second half, but Jermaine Johnson sealed victory on the eighty-ninth minute, after going one-on-one with the goalkeeper. However, Marlon King did score from the penalty-spot, with exactly the last kick of the game, after a clumsy challenge from R\u00e9da Johnson. Wednesday went second in the league after two games, due to the number of goals scored. Millwall were Wednesday's next opponents, again at home, and the Owls took the lead through the in-form Jermaine Johnson, who scored with a wonderful shot from outside the area. However, as thunder and lightning struck Hillsborough Wednesday's level of performance dropped, and so did their lead with Millwall scoring twice through James Henry and Liam Trotter, and Sheffield Wednesday went into the break a goal behind. Great team spirit and a higher level of performance saw Miguel Llera score a thoroughly deserved equaliser after a scramble in the box, which included the ball hitting the post and a wonderful save. Then as Wednesday pushed on defender Miguel Llera scored again after a Rhys McCabe free-kick in the last-minute of normal time. The Owls had turned it around again and won the game 3\u20132.", "The first international break of the campaign arrived and saw two Sheffield Wednesday players going out on international duty. Impressive youngster Rhys McCabe played the whole of the first game for the Scotland U-21's against Luxembourg U-21, however McCabe was only on the bench for the game against Austria U-21. Nejc Pe\u010dnik for Slovenia did not come off the bench for the game against Switzerland, however did within just the first five minutes against Norway in which Slovenia lost 2\u20131. Wednesday 12 September 2012, saw the eagerly anticipated release of over 400,000 pages of official documents from the Hillsborough Independent Panel, in relation to the Hillsborough disaster. Sheffield Wednesday made a club statement on the day in which the Owls offered an apology to the families who lost loved ones in the disaster over twenty-three years ago and welcomed the release of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report. Later on in the week and after the 'emergency loan market' opened, Wednesday sealed a one-month loan deal for eighteen-year-old Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, whom the club had been chasing for 'some time'. Later that same Friday Wednesday played away to Brighton & Hove Albion. After a fairly even first twenty-four minutes Manchester City-loanee Wayne Bridge hit a free-kick that took a large deflection off Rhys McCabe and went into the back of the net. After that Brighton took control of the game and maybe deserved to be 2\u20130 up at the break. The Owls came back slightly better after the break with Ross Barkley coming off the bench to make his debut. However, Brighton soon went back to dominating the game and within ten minutes of the restart they scored again through top scorer Craig Mackail-Smith and four minutes later a good move saw Will Buckley to score and finish Wednesday off. Debutant Jay Bothroyd came close to a late consolation goal but the end result finished in a 3\u20130 loss for the Owls, their biggest loss since nearly exactly the same time last year.", "Back on home soil, Wednesday faced Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town, and a great game was anticipated after last season's very dramatic 4\u20134 draw at Hillsborough Stadium. The game however was introduced with a minutes silence in respect to those that we have all lost, after a long few weeks which saw the Hillsborough disaster being a major talking point in society and through the media and also due to a Huddersfield Town fan who had died the week previously in the war in Afghanistan. The game then kicked off, and, within the first fifteen minutes of the game, Mark Beevers hit the bar for the Owls, and also James Vaughan of Huddersfield had an optimistic effort hit the bar. However, a controversial penalty was awarded when Jermaine Johnson seemed to foul Jack Hunt in the area. Oliver Norwood saw his penalty saved by Chris Kirkland but scored from the follow-up. Just two minutes later and a diving header from Lee Novak doubled Huddersfield's lead, and saw echoes of last season's encounter at Hillsborough, where Huddersfield were also two-up at this stage. Nearly twenty minutes later and R\u00e9da Johnson headed home to make the score 1\u20132. A minute after the goal, Joel Lynch saw a straight red card, after a challenge on Michail Antonio. With, Wednesday pushing for an equaliser before half-time, the Owls' defender Joe Mattock was sent-off deep in stoppage-time of the first half, with his first yellow card also being debatable. Half-time was then called after an entertaining first half. The second half began quite evenly, however eventually Wednesday started to push with R\u00e9da Johnson and Nejc Pe\u010dnik coming close. However, referee Salisbury was centre of attention again when he awarded Huddersfield Town their second penalty of the match for a Rhys McCabe handball, which replays after the game saw the decision to be harsh and more of a ball-to-hand incident. Adam Clayton stepped up and scored from the spot. R\u00e9da Johnson missed an almost open-net late on and the game finished in a 1\u20133 loss, with a total of seven yellow cards and two reds being handed out. This was Sheffield Wednesday's third defeat on the bounce, their first at home since February (after losing to Stevenage), and their biggest home defeat since March 2011 when they were defeated by Brentford. Later that same week Wednesday were in action again at home, this time against recently relegated Premier League side Bolton Wanderers. Although the Owls started brightly, with Michail Antonio looking the most troublesome player, the game became quite even and a Bolton corner saw Marcos Alonso score with a free-header. Second half was similar to the first with quite an even contest, but the Owls did start to push for the equaliser and deservedly got it when a foul in the box was conceded and loanee Ross Barkley scored from the penalty spot. However, just three minutes later and after a mistake by new-signing and captain Martin Taylor, Mark Davies curled a shot into the top corner of the goal, which saw Bolton Wanderers win the game 1\u20132. This was the first time Sheffield Wednesday had been beaten in four consecutive league matches since September 2010.", "The international break came with Wednesday having lost six of their last seven games. Rhys McCabe was called up to the Scotland U-21 squad, but did not play due to injury. Meanwhile, Nejc Pe\u010dnik was called up to the Slovenia side, but did not come off the bench in either of their games against Cyprus and Albania.", "The weekend before Christmas saw the Owls face Charlton Athletic at Hillsborough. Charlton was one of only two teams last season to beat Wednesday at Hillsborough. Charlton Athletic started the better of the two teams and came close after great work by Danny Haynes. However, Sheffield Wednesday slowly progressed into the game and started to be the team on the front foot, and after twenty-minutes a corner by Miguel Llera was cleared to the edge of the box where youngster Rhys McCabe spectacularly volleyed with his left foot into the back of the net. Sheffield Wednesday remained on top for the majority of the rest of the half, although created little else. Similarly to the first half, the second half started with Charlton Athletic on top, but Wednesday worked themselves into the game and the contest was quite even until the last five-minutes, along with stoppage time, where Charlton tried to push for an equaliser. The Owls remained comfortable at the back though, and scored another in the last minute of stoppage time, when a brilliant burst of pace by loanee J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan saw him sprint past two players and finished from a tight angle to give Sheffield Wednesday a 2\u20130 win. It was Sheffield Wednesday's second-consecutive win and clean sheet, and their first home win since the beginning of November. It also brought them out of the relegation zone for the first time since the middle of November, despite other teams around them winning as well.", "Saturday 12 January 2013 saw a late kick-off for Sheffield Wednesday as they faced second in the league Hull City at the KC Stadium, live on Sky Sports. Manager Dave Jones opted to play with no recognised striker and therefore had six midfielder's playing, with one being Giles Coke, who has only played once so far this season, and went on loan and has been injured until today's comeback. The game kicked off and first chance of the game came to Jermaine Johnson, whose shot just outside the area was tipped over the bar by the goalkeeper. Hull City started to take control of the game, but did not have any key chances. However, Hull City defender Abdoulaye Faye went into a tackle very dangerously using two-feet, and although won the ball should have arguably been sent-off. The defender escaped without a card, this decision was the first of many controversial decisions within the game. Then on 24-minutes, a free-kick by Rhys McCabe was met by R\u00e9da Johnson whose effort was poorly saved by Hull City goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovi\u0107 and it rolled into the back of net, giving Wednesday the lead. As Hull City began to pressurise Sheffield Wednesday, a counterattack was suddenly started and Jermaine Johnson's square pass to Michail Antonio had the goal gaping for the 0\u20132 lead. However, Michail Antonio very poorly controlled the ball and the goalkeeper ended up making a comfortable save. The Owls managed to hold onto the lead for half-time. Into the second half and the game began to even out, although Sheffield Wednesday did still look the more dangerous side on the attack. Then another free-kick for Sheffield Wednesday saw Anthony Gardner flick on the ball where Giles Coke just beat the goalkeeper to the ball and Sheffield Wednesday were unexpectedly celebrating a 0\u20132 lead. However, as the camera's concentrated on the celebrations, Hull City were suddenly attacking, the referee had not given the goal. It appears the referee had called for a foul for Giles Coke taking the ball out of the goalkeeper's hands. However, replays show this was most certainly not the case. Sheffield Wednesday looked robbed of a clear victory when a superb ball into the box saw Robert Koren head home and equalise for Hull City. Wednesday did not give up faith, and were rewarded when three-minutes later a corner by Sheffield Wednesday curled into the goalkeeper's hands, although he caught the ball just behind the line and the Owls were leading again. Hull City goalkeeper Jakupovi\u0107 went down in a bundle, in which seemed to be a shame behind the goal. However, it soon was obvious that Eldin Jakupovi\u0107 was seriously injured and was taken off in a stretcher with replays showing R\u00e9da Johnson just catching the goalkeeper on the face, but it was not a defence for the goal not to be given. There was seven-minutes stoppage time indicated and in the fifth-minute of stoppages, a clearance saw Michail Antonio just beat one player to the ball and then taking-on another man to be one-on-one, he rounded the substitute goalkeeper and passed the ball into the empty net. Sheffield Wednesday led by 1\u20133. It was not the end of controversy as the referee seemed to take an age to blow his whistle for full-time, in the thirteenth-minute of stoppages, Ahmed Elmohamady for Hull went down easily in the box and a penalty was given. Jay Simpson stepped up and his penalty was saved by Chris Kirkland. An incredible game with plenty to talk about was ended a minute-later with Sheffield Wednesday gaining a surprising but vital victory, taking them three-points clear of the relegation zone.", "| Rhys McCabe", "| Rhys McCabe", "| Rhys McCabe", "| Rhys McCabe", "| Rhys McCabe", "|Rhys McCabe", "| Rhys McCabe", "|= || || ||16 ||Rhys McCabe || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|= ||16 || || ||Rhys McCabe || 3 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 0", "| Rhys McCabe", "| Rhys McCabe"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Portsmouth F.C. season", "response": ["| 33 ||  || MF || Rhys McCabe || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["With hours to go before the League Cup, Round 1 fixture against local rivals Rotherham United kicked off and it was confirmed that Portuguese left-back Rafael Floro had signed for the club having spent all pre-season impressing while playing for the Owls. Rafael Floro is yet to play in a professional competitive fixture, although is likely to make an appearance on the day of his signing for the club, with Wednesday currently without any full-backs due to injury. And Floro did make his first career appearance hours later as he was one of three changes for the League Cup clash. The game was delayed by 15 minutes due to crowd congestion, but when the game did kick-off it was all Rotherham United who were taking the game to the Owls. And when a long throw-in was launched into the box, it bounced all the way to the other side of the box where Rotherham midfielder Ben Pringle volleyed into the far top corner of the net. Rotherham United continued to be the better side but soon after when Wednesday got a  free-kick 35 yards out, Rhys McCabe stepped up, and with the help of a small deflection, hit the ball into the far corner of the net to put the game level again. Although the game did even out slightly after this, it was still Rotherham United who played as the better side and when another long thrown-in was cleared just to the outside of the box, it was Lee Frecklington who managed to find some space and strike the ball from distance into the net and Rotherham were in front again. Into the second half and chances were few and far, but the main talking point was when Wednesday substitute Jermaine Johnson lost his cool and head-butted an opposition player in an off-the-ball incident. The officials were aware of this and Jermaine Johnson got a straight red-card, earning himself a three-match suspension on top of the already many injuries to the side. That was the last main piece of action and it was Rotherham United who went through to the next round, while earning themselves 'bragging rights' with Sheffield Wednesday losing and falling at the first hurdle of the competition. The weekend following the League Cup defeat and Sheffield Wednesday faced Burnley in the first home game of the season. Further injuries had hit the squad by the game, stretching the squad to its limit. The first opportunity of the game was when a shot was deflected into a cross and went into Sam Vokes's path, but he was unable to convert due to a good Chris Kirkland save. As Wednesday got into the game it was them who had more of the chances, with J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan's shot from distance just going wide and Jacques Maghoma's accurate free-kick being well-saved by the opposition goalkeeper. Also another chance was when Michail Antonio's cross fell to David Prutton whose shot hit the side netting. Maghoma's clever cross was nearly deflected to an own goal, but when Burnley broke on the Owls, a cross was failed to be closed down by new-boy and youngster Rafael Floro and unfortunately the cross fell to Danny Ings who headed home comfortably to give Burnley the lead. Then just five-minutes later near enough exactly the same thing happened: Floro failed to close down the cross and Sam Vokes headed pass the keeper to put Burnley two in front. Wednesday had been the better side in the first-half but poor defending had led to them being 2\u20130 down. Sheffield Wednesday came out fighting in the second half and Atdhe Nuhiu's header seemed destined for the far top-corner but span just wide. Nuhiu then had another head well saved and the follow up by Antonio was also blocked. With around 20-minutes to go and the Owls got what they deserved, a goal. Liam Palmer's first time cross met the head of Prutton to pull a goal back for Wednesday.
