Galston is a village in Ayrshire a few miles north of Burns's farm at Mossgiel. Burns had been reproved by Dr Smith, and Burns retaliated by pillorying Smith twice, by name, in \"The Holy Fair\", where he says that \"his English tongue and gesture fine are a' clean oot o' season\".  He is also mentioned in \"The Twa Herds\" and \"The Kirk's Alarm\".\nReverend Smith married Marion Freer. Their daughter Henrietta (\"Helen\") Scott Smith married Lewis Balfour, a minister of nearby Sorn (later Minister at Collinton), and was the grandmother of Robert Louis Stevenson.\nHe is buried in Galston Parish Church (which was built during his ministry, opened on 18 June 1809). There is a memorial plaque to him and his widow, Marion Freer, on the south wall.\nTheir son Rev George Smith DD (1793-1866) was minister of the Tolbooth parish in Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": {}}}
