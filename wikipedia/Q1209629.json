Among his films are Ken Russell's Savage Messiah (1972), Mahler (1974) and Tommy (1975), John Schlesinger's Yanks (1979), and a number of films directed by Blake Edwards.After attending Plymouth Art College, he was called up to serve in the Royal Military Police as an Officer after which he had various jobs, including working for Fry's Chocolate, and Clarks Shoes, where he began producing promotional films. This eventually landed him a job at the BBC in 1961, where he became part of the early outside broadcasting team and went with Malcolm Muggeridge to film the Holy Land. While never leaving television totally, he started working with feature films already in 1968.He won a BAFTA TV Award  for Individual Honour in 1967, and in 1980, he was nominated for a BAFTA for Best Cinematography for Yanks. In 1982, he was nominated for a similar award by the British Society of Cinematographers for Victor Victoria. And in 1996, he was nominated for a Gemini Award for Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series for The Man in the Attic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pink Panther", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Dick Bush"]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4 || Dick Bush || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 65 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Cinematographer, Camera Operator || "]}, {"page": "Aliens (film)", "response": ["The crew was dismissive of Cameron for his relative inexperience, thinking he had not done enough to earn such a prominent position, and Hurd had her job only because she was his partner.

First assistant director Derek Cracknell also ignored Cameron's requests.

Scheider's then-wife, Cynthia Scheider, was an assistant film editor who had previously worked with Bud Smith on The Exorcist. Since shooting the film required a prolonged stay in South America, the actress asked Friedkin if she could stay with him and have a job in an editing capacity. The director fulfilled his wish and was reportedly \"delighted\". Sorcerer was filmed during a ten-month production schedule, using approximately 1,200 camera set-ups. The director attempted to complete the picture \"without relying on dialogue\", and \"telling the story through imagery\" instead. In the film's pressbook Friedkin states that for him creating a film is multi-faceted experience: \"[e]very film is actually three films[.] There is the film you conceive and plan. There is the film you actually shoot. And there is the film that emerges with you in the editing room\".", "During a sequence involving the detonation of an enormous kaoba tree, Friedkin was faced with a problem of inadequate explosive power. Initially, Marcel Vercoutere, a special effects man who previously worked with the director on The Exorcist, was to be responsible for the explosion. However, it did not achieve the required effect and barely damaged the tree. This prompted Friedkin to reach for the services of an arsonist hailing from Queens, New York, going by the pseudonym \"Marvin the Torch\", who arrived at the Dominican Republic three days after the call and utilizing flammable materials obliterated the tree in one take the following morning. A week into the shooting in the Dominican Republic, Friedkin and his crew went to Los Angeles to process the film and view dailies. The director described the prologues as \"beautifully shot\", but he was dissatisfied with the jungle scenes which he deemed \"underexposed\" and \"dark\". He told Dick Bush a reshoot would be necessary. Bush, on the other hand, argued that filming should have taken place on a stage where he could have adequately adjusted the lighting. The response reminded Friedkin of his previous problems on the set of The Boys in the Band and offended him, as from the very beginning he had wanted to shoot the entire film on location. Upon seeing the underexposed scenes, Bush reportedly \"lost confidence\" and was subsequently dismissed, which forced Friedkin to employ a new camera crew. He replaced Bush with John M. Stephens with whom he had worked under David L. Wolper. Stephens applied necessary changes, including the employment of reflectors balancing \"the deep shadows of the tall trees\", as well as replacing lenses and film stock. This resulted in a leap of cinematographic quality which delighted the director, who has said \"the locations looked beautiful to the eye\"."]}, {"page": "Culloden (film)", "response": ["According to an estimate by the cinematographer for the film, Dick Bush, about 85% of all camerawork in Culloden was hand-held.Welsh, James Michael.
