Beaumont joined Nottingham Forest from Newcastle United in 2003, along with Ross Gardner. Unlike Gardner, however, Beamount was unable to break into the first team, and his only league appearance was during a loan spell with Darlington. During the January 2007 transfer window, he was released by Forest and signed for Northwich Victoria; however, he departed after only two months, released on 19 March.\nFollowing his release from Northwich, Beaumont retired from football to concentrate on journalism, later writing for the Nottingham Forest match-day programme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Staffordshire University", "response": ["*James Beaumont, Professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Neale McDermott", "response": ["McDermott started his career at Newcastle United.
