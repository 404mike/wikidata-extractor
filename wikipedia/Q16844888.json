Davies was selected on one occasion in 1924 to represent Wales in an infamous game against Scotland at Inverleith. Wales was completely outclassed letting in eight tries. Although Davies was never selected to play for Wales again he was chosen to represent the British Lions in their 1924 tour of South Africa. The 1924 tour was notorious for the amount of injuries suffered by the tourists, and Davies was called out at the late in the tour as a replacement.Griffiths (1987), pg 9:6.

Evans first game was against England at the Cardiff Arms Park under the captaincy of Tom Parker. Wales won in style, scoring a then record eight tries. All five Swansea players representing Wales in that match scored, Evans, Parker, Bowen and Palmer all scored tries, and Joe Rees completed two conversions. Evans was back on the scoresheet in his very next match, scoring a very late drop goal to grab a draw against Scotland at Inverleith.Godwin (1984), pg 135. Evans scored in both remaining games of the tournament, scoring tries in both wins over Ireland and then France. In the game against France, Evans was not originally chosen to play, but shortly before the kick-off the Welsh selectors dropped Frank Palmer and Harold Davies, and replaced them with Evans and Cliff Richards. Although becoming a Championship winner and scoring in every international game, Evans was not selected to represent Wales after 1922. This was due to having to retire from rugby because of a serious cartilage injury to his knee.

After the end of World War I he joined Llanelli a first class team within Welsh club rugby. He left Llanelli under poor circumstances, some sources stating that Hiddlestone was considered \"too dirty\" for the club,Not only Neath may be cast into outer darkness The Independent 18-12-2001 though at the time of leaving the club he was the present team captain, a position elected by the club members. Whatever the reason for his leaving Llanelli, Hiddlestone was accepted to play for Neath. In 1922 he was first selected to represent Wales as part of the Home Nations Championship in a game against England. The Welsh team he joined had many new caps, including Swansea's Islwyn Evans and Frank Palmer, Bridgend's Bobby Delahay and William Cummins from Treorchy. Led by Tom Parker, Wales overran the English team, scoring a record eight tries against England; Hiddlestone himself not only scored one of the tries, but is also credited as being the central linchpin in the Welsh attack that won the game so comfortably.Smith (1980), pg 205."]}, {"page": "Cliff Richards (rugby union)", "response": ["Richards was first capped for Wales while playing first class rugby for Pontypool. His first international game was against England in the opening Welsh match of the 1922 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Tom Parker, Wales were convincing winners over a far more experienced England, running in eight tries, of which Richards scored one. The 1922 Wales Championship team, captained by Tom Parker, was noted for its stability, with only two changes throughout the entire campaign. Richards played in all four matches, though was initially dropped for the final match of the tournament against France. The selectors had originally chosen Frank Palmer and Harold Davies, but switched to Richards and Islwyn Evans, just minutes before kick-off, as they believed they would be better suited to the harder French sun-baked pitch.Godwin (1984), pg 138. At the end of the Championship, Wales won three games and drew the match against Scotland, lifting the tournament as out-right winners."]}, {"page": "Frank Palmer", "response": ["Frank Palmer may refer to:", "*Frank Palmer (rugby union) (1896\u20131925), Welsh rugby union player", "*Frank Palmer (musician) on California", "*Frank Palmer (Australian footballer) (1925\u20131970), Australian rules footballer for South Melbourne", "*Frank Palmer (businessman) (born 1940), Canadian advertising executive", "*Frank Palmer Speare (1869\u20131954), first president of Northeastern University"]}]}}
