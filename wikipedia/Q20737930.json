He was born at Barton-upon-Irwell, Manchester, England.\nKennedy was a right-handed middle-order batsman. He scored 63 on debut against Oxford University in June 1960 and was then picked for a few more games that season, though he did not pass 50 again that year. In one of his 1960 matches, a home game against Somerset that was drifting towards a draw, he was put on to bowl for the final overs of the Somerset second innings before close of play: in nine balls, he took two wickets for just one run, and his victims were both Test players, Abbas Ali Baig and Colin McCool. Despite this success, he never bowled his right arm off breaks again.\nKennedy played fairly regularly for Warwickshire in 1961, achieving 756 runs in the season at an average of 27.00, but his highest score was only 78. He was less successful in 1962, though his 94 against Oxford University was the highest score of his first-class career, and he did not play any further first-class cricket after the end of the season. In 1964, he played Minor Counties cricket in a few matches for Staffordshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Kennedy (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Kennedy may also refer to:", "*John Kennedy (Australian musician) (born 1958), Australian musician", "*John Kennedy (cellist) (1922\u20131980), Australian musician", "*John Kennedy (Irish celebrity) (fl. 1968, 2009), songwriter", "*John Kennedy (American musician) (fl. 1987), American musician", "*John Kennedy (fl. 1620s), English author of the 1626 poem Calanthrop and Lucilla", "*John Kennedy (puppeteer) (born 1967), American puppeteer ", "*John Kennedy (radio broadcaster), British radio DJ and podcast host ", "*John Kennedy Toole (1937\u20131969), American novelist", "*John Kennedy (Brazilian footballer) (born 2002), football forward", "*John Kennedy (English footballer) (born 1978), footballer for Bury Town", "*John Kennedy (Northern Irish footballer) (born 1939), football goalkeeper", "*John Kennedy (Scottish footballer) (born 1983), Scottish footballer and manager", "*John Kennedy (Dublin Gaelic footballer) (fl. 1891\u20131894), Irish Gaelic footballer", "*John Kennedy (Canadian football) (born 1950), Canadian football player", "*John Kennedy Jr. (footballer) (born 1959), Australian rules footballer", "*John Kennedy (Gaelic footballer) (fl. 1984\u20132010), Gaelic football player and manager", "*John Kennedy Sr. (footballer) (1928\u20132020), Australian football player and coach", "*John Kennedy (canoeist) (fl. 1970s), American canoeist", "*John Kennedy (cricketer) (born 1931), English cricketer", "*John Kennedy (cyclist) (1931\u20131989), British cyclist", "*John Kennedy (hurler) (born 1964), Irish hurler", "*John Kennedy (racing driver) (fl. 1970s), American racing driver", "*John Kennedy (rowing) (1900\u20131971), American coxswain", "*John Kennedy (shortstop) (1926\u20131998), American Major League Baseball player", "*John Kennedy (third baseman) (1941\u20132018), American Major League Baseball player", "*John Kennedy (Louisiana politician) (born 1951), United States Senator from Louisiana", "*John Kennedy (Pennsylvania politician) (born 1938), member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives", "*John Kennedy (Utah politician) (1847\u20131928), Utah House of Representatives", "*John Kennedy (Manitoba politician) (1867\u20131927), Canadian politician", "*John Kennedy (public servant) (1884\u2013?), Australian public servant, Controller-General of the Department of Trade and Customs", "*John Kennedy (Medal of Honor) (1834\u20131910), American soldier", "*Sir John Kennedy (British Army officer, born 1878) (1878\u20131948), British general", "*Sir John Kennedy (British Army officer, born 1893) (1893\u20131970), British general", "*John Kennedy (1759\u20131842), English nurseryman, of Lee and Kennedy", "*John Kennedy, 2nd Lord Kennedy (before 1454\u2013c. 1508/9), Scottish lord", "*John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis (1575\u20131615), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis (died 1668), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy, 7th Earl of Cassilis (1653\u20131701), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy, 8th Earl of Cassilis (1700\u20131759), Scottish peer", "*John Kennedy (engineer) (1838\u20131921), Canadian civil engineer", "*John Kennedy (manufacturer) (1769\u20131855), Scottish-born textile manufacturer in Manchester, UK", "*John Kennedy (music industry executive) (born 1953), British entertainment lawyer", "*John Kennedy (theologian) (1813\u20131900), British religious leader and author ", "*John Kennedy (journalist) (1926\u20131994), New Zealand newspaper editor and political analyst", "*John Kennedy (The Inbetweeners), in the 2009\u20132010 British sitcom"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Kennedy (1960\u20131962) : J.
