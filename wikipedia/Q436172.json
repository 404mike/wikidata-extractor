As a competition climber, Moffatt won several of the nascent climbing tour events, and retired ranked first in the world.  As a boulder climber, Moffatt was one of the first-ever to solve problems of boulder grade 8A+ (V12), and 8B (V13).  As a traditional climber, Moffatt established some of the most intimidating routes at the time in Britain, which are still rarely repeated, and in particular, the Master's Wall (E7 6b) in 1983.Moffatt was noted for the intensity of his training, and the co-development of training techniques now considered mainstream in professional climbing.  In 1991, Moffatt opened Britain's first indoor climbing centre, \"The Foundry\" in Sheffield.  He has written books on mental preparation for competition climbing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of climbers and mountaineers", "response": ["* Jerry Moffatt (born 1963) UK, sport climber and boulderer"]}, {"page": "Nelson's Column", "response": ["The column has also been climbed on several occasions as a publicity stunt to draw attention to social or political causes.

On 30 March 1988, Joe Simpson and John Stevenson climbed the column as part of a Greenpeace Campaign against Acid Rain. On 14 June 1992, it was climbed by Martin Cotterrel, Joe Simpson and John Stevenson on behalf of Greenpeace to protest against the first Earth Summit meeting in Brazil. On 13 April 1995, Simon Nadin free-climbed Nelson's Column with Noel Craine, Jerry Moffatt and Johnny Dawes following on top rope, and graded the climb as \"E6 6b/5a\". This protest time was on behalf of Survival International to publicize the plight of Canada's Inuit people. On 13 May 1998, the Column was climbed by Al Baker, Peter Morris and John Cunningham on behalf of Greenpeace to protest against Old growth logging activity in British Columbia.

In his biography, Fawcett said that by late 1983, he was desperate to find a bold new route and that someone had mentioned that Moffatt had been working on a new climb just below Great Arete (E5 5c), at Millstone Edge, and had already called it Master's Edge (in January 1983, Moffatt had freed a major new route he called Master's Wall E7 6b at Clogwyn Du'r Arddu).
