She is the most successful captain of the England women's national team in terms of tournament successes and recognised as one of the genuine but unsung pioneers of the modern women's game. Thomas became captain at the age of 21 and held that position until her retirement with a then record 56 caps in 1985. She remained the longest, continuous serving captain for a period of 26 years before being overtaken by Faye White in 2011.\nThomas was a sturdy right-sided defender, who refused offers of professionalism from Italy and New Zealand in order to maintain the strict amateur status which was enforced by the Women's Football Association at that time. She was a leading women's footballing figure in the north of England and in particular her home area of Yorkshire, appearing in and on local and national media and, when on tours, the foreign media.", "link_mentions": []}}
