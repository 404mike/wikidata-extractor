More specifically, the name may be a contraction of two Romano-British words, tros (\"over\") and hynt (\"way\"). This may indeed indicate a river that is prone to flooding. However, a more likely explanation may be that it was considered to be a river that could be crossed principally by means of fords, i.e. the river flowed over major road routes. This may explain the presence of the Romano-British element rid (cf. Welsh rhyd, \"ford\") in various place names along the Trent, such as Hill Ridware, as well as the Old English\u2010derived ford. Another translation is given as \"the trespasser\", referring to the waters flooding over the land. According to Koch at the University of Wales, the name Trent derives from the Romano-British Trisantona, a Romano-British reflex of the combined  elements *tri-sent(o)-on-\u0101- (through-path-augmentative-feminine-) \u2018great thoroughfare\u2019.

A list composed in 1641 for the Trent, contained thirty types of fish and other species including those that migrated from the sea such as shad, smelt, salmon and flounder, and riverine species such as trout, grayling, perch and pike."]}, {"page": "1683 in literature", "response": ["*December 15 \u2013 Izaak Walton, English writer and biographer (born 1593)"]}, {"page": "1676 in literature", "response": ["*Charles Cotton \u2013 Cotton's Angler (a continuation of Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler)", "*Izaak Walton \u2013 The Compleat Angler, 5th edition"]}, {"page": "1670 in literature", "response": ["*Izaak Walton \u2013 Life of George Herbert"]}, {"page": "1668 in literature", "response": ["*unknown date \u2013 Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler goes into its fourth edition."]}, {"page": "1664 in literature", "response": ["*Izaak Walton \u2013 The Compleat Angler, 3rd edition"]}, {"page": "1661 in literature", "response": ["**Third edition of Izaak Walton's The Compleat Angler."]}, {"page": "1655 in literature", "response": ["*Izaak Walton \u2013 The Compleat Angler (2nd edition)"]}, {"page": "1653 in literature", "response": ["*Izaak Walton  -The Compleat Angler"]}, {"page": "1626 in literature", "response": ["*December 27 \u2013 Izaak Walton marries Rachel Floud (died 1640).Tara Hamling: \"'An Arelome To This Hous For Ever': Monumental Fixtures and Furnishings...\" Andrew Gordon and Thomas Rist (eds): The Arts of Remembrance in Early Modern England: Memorial Cultures...

In 1633 all of his English poems were published in The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations, with a preface by Ferrar. The book went through eight editions by 1690. According to Izaak Walton, when Herbert sent the manuscript to Ferrar, he said that \"he shall find in it a picture of the many spiritual conflicts that have passed between God and my soul, before I could subject mine to the will of Jesus, my Master\".
