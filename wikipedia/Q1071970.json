His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport. Although a strong man, his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to despatching his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered.\nJohnson's first fight probably took place in June 1783 against Jack Jarvis, after he had unintentionally slighted the wagon driver and professional fighter. Jarvis challenged Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour, and was comprehensively beaten in the resulting match. Johnson's success encouraged him to take up the sport professionally. By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion, although whether of England or the world is uncertain.\nIn the later years of his fight career, and for some time after it ended, he acted as a second for other prominent fighters and ran a public house. His dissipation outside the ring appears to have resulted in his decision to leave England for Ireland, where he continued to tutor other boxers but eventually resorted to gambling to earn a living. He died a broken man, both physically and financially.\nJohnson was inducted into the Pioneer category of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1995.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bare-knuckle boxing", "response": ["* Tom Johnson 1787-1791"]}, {"page": "Thomas Johnson", "response": ["Thomas Johnson, Tom Johnson or Tommy Johnson may refer to:", "*Tom Johnson (composer) (born 1939), American minimalist composer", "*Tom Johnson (sound engineer) (born 1958), American film sound mixer", "*Tom Johnson (journalist) (born 1941), American media executive; publisher of the Los Angeles Times and president of CNN", "*Tom Johnson (Illinois politician) (born 1945), Illinois State Senator", "*Tom Johnson (baseball, born 1951), American pitcher for the Minnesota Twins", "*Tom Johnson (baseball, born 1889) (1889\u20131926), American pitcher in the Negro leagues", "*Tom Johnson (bareknuckle boxer) (1750\u20131797), born Tom Jackling, English bare-knuckle boxer", "*Tom Johnson (boxer) (born 1964), American featherweight boxer", "*Tom Johnson (tackle) (born 1931), American football offensive/defensive tackle for Michigan and the Green Bay Packers", "*Tom Johnson (defensive tackle) (born 1984), American defensive tackle drafted by the Indianapolis Colts", "*Tom Johnson (footballer, born 1911) (1911\u20131983), English football defender for Sheffield United and Lincoln City", "*Tom Johnson (footballer, born 1921) (1921\u20131999), English footballer, Inside Forward for Gateshead and Nottingham Forest", "*Tom Johnson (footballer, born 1926), English football left half or forward for Darlington and Bradford Park Avenue", "*Tom Johnson (rugby union, born 1893) (1893\u20131948), Wales international rugby union player", "*Tom Johnson (rugby union, born 1982), rugby union player for Exeter Chiefs", "*Tom Johnson (golfer) (born 1981), American member of the PGA tour", "*Tom Johnson (ice hockey) (1928\u20132007), Canadian ice hockey defenceman", "*Tom Johnson (lacrosse) (born 1985), Canadian lacrosse player", "*Tom Johnson (runner), American runner third at the 1995 IAU 100 km World Championships ", "*Tom Johnson (swimming coach) (born 1963), American swim and diving coach", "*Tom Johnson (astronomer) (1923\u20132012), American astronomer and electrical engineer, founder of Celestron", "*Tom Johnson (lawyer) (born 1971), American attorney based in Portland, Oregon"]}, {"page": "Daniel Mendoza", "response": ["The second bout with Humphries made history.
