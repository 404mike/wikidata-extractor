His son, Anthony, was a professional footballer and played at Stoke. Pulis had a 17-year career as a defender where he played for Bristol Rovers, Newport County, AFC Bournemouth and Gillingham. He also had a short spell in Hong Kong with Happy Valley.\nPulis took his first steps into management at Bournemouth, where he was a player/coach and then Harry Redknapp's assistant. He then took control when Redknapp left the club. He then went on to Gillingham before leaving in 1999 after a dispute with chairman Paul Scally. Pulis then had unsuccessful spells at Bristol City and Portsmouth before being appointed manager of Stoke City in 2002. He guided Stoke through a tough 2002\u201303 season avoiding relegation to the Second Division on the final day of the season. He spent two more seasons with Stoke before being sacked by Stoke's Icelandic board for \"failing to exploit the foreign market\". He spent the 2005\u201306 season at Plymouth Argyle before returning to Stoke along with Peter Coates. After narrowly missing out on a play-off spot in the 2006\u201307 season he guided Stoke to the Premier League in the 2007\u201308 season by finishing runners-up in the Championship.\nWith Stoke amongst the favourites for relegation upon their return to the top flight after a 23-year absence, Stoke went on to comfortably survive and finished in 12th position. Pulis made history during the 2010\u201311 season as he guided Stoke to their first FA Cup Final after beating Bolton Wanderers 5\u20130 in the semi-final. The Potters, however, lost the final 1\u20130 to Manchester City, but had the consolation of qualifying for European football. In the UEFA Europa League, Stoke lost 2\u20130 on aggregate in the round of 32 to Spanish giants Valencia. The 2012\u201313 season saw Stoke make little progress and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.\nPulis returned to management on 23 November 2013 joining Crystal Palace on a two-and-a-half-year contract. He guided Palace away from relegation, to their highest Premier League finish of 11th in 2013\u201314, which earned him the Premier League Manager of the Season award. He left the club, however, shortly before the start of the subsequent season. He joined West Bromwich Albion in January 2015, a post he held until November 2017. Pulis achieved a top half finish with West Brom in the 2016\u201317 season, finishing 10th, but the club made a poor start to the following season, culminating in his sacking. On Boxing Day 2017, Pulis was appointed manager of Middlesbrough, a post he held until May 2019. On 13 November 2020, Pulis returned to management when he was named manager of Sheffield Wednesday; however, on 28 December, he was sacked after 10 games in charge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol City F.C.", "response": ["Jordan remained at the helm for two seasons after City's relegation, but left in March 1997 after failing to get them back into Division One.

But City struggled back in Division One, and Ward stepped down in October 1998 to be succeeded by Benny Lennartsson, their first non-British manager. City were relegated in bottom place and Lennartsson was dismissed in favour of Gillingham's Tony Pulis, who lasted six months before leaving to take over at Portsmouth. During his time at Ashton Gate he was manager of perhaps the worst City side since the one that completed a hat-trick of successive relegations almost 20 years earlier.", "| Tony Pulis"]}, {"page": "Plymouth Argyle F.C.", "response": ["* 2005  Tony Pulis"]}, {"page": "West Bromwich Albion F.C.", "response": ["Hodgson guided Albion to an 11th-place finish for the 2010\u201311 season.

On 5 August 2016, it was announced that long-term owner Jeremy Peace had sold the club to a Chinese investment group headed up by Lai Guochuan. By this time, the club had already begun to fall into a state of torpor, and were relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2017\u201318 season, ending their eight-year Premier League stay. Pulis and his replacement Alan Pardew were both sacked during the season. Albion finished fourth in their first season back in the Championship under the management of Darren Moore, and later, caretaker manager James Shan, losing the Championship play-off semi-final against Aston Villa on penalties.

He brought in new manager Tony Pulis, who led Gillingham to promotion in his first season, finishing second in the old Division Three (now Football League Two).  In 1999 the Gills made the play-offs but lost in the final to Manchester City.

Soon after the play-off loss, Pulis was sacked for gross misconduct, and Peter Taylor appointed manager.  In the 1999\u201300 season Gillingham qualified for the play-offs again, where they faced Wigan Athletic in the final at Wembley Stadium.

Peter Taylor replaced him and took the club to a second consecutive play-off final, where Gillingham gained promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time.
