He was the son of the amateur artist Charles Hodgson, whom he accompanied on a tour of Wales in 1805, when he was seven. He was taught art by John Crome at Norwich Grammar School.\nHodgson never lived away from Norwich. As well as earning an income from the sale of his paintings, he was employed as a drawing master at the Grammar School, which allowed him to live a comfortable, if uneventful, existence. He was an accomplished painter of architectural subjects, and showed works on a regular basis at exhibitions in Norwich, London and elsewhere. His paintings have at times been confused with those of his father, as his artistic style did not develop significantly during his career. A leading member the Norwich Society of Artists, he was a strong advocate for the arts in Norwich, and a man who was popular with both his pupils and his fellow artists during his lifetime.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["*David Hodgson"]}, {"page": "David Hodgson", "response": ["David Hodgson may refer to:", "* David Hodgson (rugby league) (born 1981), English rugby league footballer", "* David Hodgson (judge) (1939\u20132012), Australian judge", "* David Hodgson (chemist), English chemistry professor", "* David Hodgson (footballer) (born 1960), English football player", "* David Hodgson (artist) (1798\u20131864), English painter", "* David Hodgson, convicted murderer, see murder of Jenny Nicholl"]}, {"page": "Henry Ninham", "response": ["Henry Ninham (15 October 1796 \u2013 23 October 1874) was an English landscape artist, engraver and heraldic painter.

They sometimes etched the same buildings, as with the now demolished Sir Benjamin Wrenches Court, but Hodgson tended to be more interested in depicting ruins than his contemporary.Searle, Etchings of the Norwich School, p. 81. Their views of Norwich have provided historians with a valuable and accurate record of the city's streets, as many buildings that they knew have since disappeared.Walpole, Art and Artists of the Norwich School, pp. 134-135.

Together with Leman, the artists Henry Bright and John Middleton and Lound were all close friends. Along with Leman and David Hodgson, Lound was a member of the Norwich Amateur Club; he and Hodgson helped to revitalise the Norwich Artists' Conversaziones. He used his yacht Kathleen, which was adorned with a number of oil paintings, as a venue for entertaining his friends.
