The New York Times. C10. Variety wrote, \"The fun, as usual with Disney pix, comes in the believable sight gags provided along the way. Also as usual, it's a good cast of veterans and nothing to tax them beyond their abilities, all ably kept in place by director Norman Tokar. The aerial climax is especially good.\"\"Film Reviews: The Cat From Outer Space\". Variety. June 21, 1978. 18. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times described the film as \"successful G-rated family fare\" but \"at one hour, 43 minutes is too long, particularly the jeopardy situation involving the midair transfer of Duncan and her cat from a pilotless helicopter to another plane.\"Gross, Linda (July 12, 1978). \"Cat' Fantasy Fare From Walt Disney\".

For all that, The Cat from Outer Space displays its visual trickery ingeniously and more or less reverently within the caper-comedy narrative.\""]}, {"page": "The Monthly Film Bulletin", "response": ["*Martyn Auty (1978 - at least 1987)"]}, {"page": "Unidentified Flying Oddball", "response": ["Variety wrote, \"Pic has some good slapstick touches and offers a generous serving of visual tricks and space hardware, though on a par with Star Wars in that department it ain't.\" Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times stated, \"The film will provide mildly amusing summer fun for those having their first encounter with castles and kings.
