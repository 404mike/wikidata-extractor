These historians cite, for example, the Galileo affair and the Scopes trial; and assert that these were not purely instances of conflict between science and religion as personal and political factors also weighed heavily in the development of each. In addition, some historians contend that religious organizations figure prominently in the broader histories of many sciences, with many of the scientific minds until the professionalization of scientific enterprise (in the 19th century) being clergy and other religious thinkers. Some historians contend that many scientific developments such as Kepler's laws and the 19th-century reformulation of physics in terms of energy were explicitly driven by religious ideas."]}, {"page": "Ronald Numbers", "response": ["* Science and Religion Around the World, (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011) (ed. with John Hedley Brooke).
