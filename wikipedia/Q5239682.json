Travelling to Denver, she meets (and has an affair with) businessman Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby), who physically abuses her. In April, Case signed a new contract with the show. Executive producer and head writer at the time John F. Smith said that upon Sharon's return to Genoa City, she wants to keep where she was a secret. That December, Sharon is horrified when Cameron arrives in town for apparent business with Newman Enterprises. Smith stated that the story with Cameron and Sharon would be one that \"builds quickly into a lot of drama\". Explaining their relationship, Ashby revealed that Cameron and Sharon were \"kindred spirits\" and hooked up, but Cameron becomes abusive, with Ashby calling him \"really disturbing\". Cameron blackmails Sharon into meeting him at a motel. When she arrives they have a physical altercation in which Sharon throws a bottle at him to keep him from raping her, \"killing\" him (or so she believes).

Detective Weber (Sherman Augustus) is suspicious of Sharon's involvement in Cameron's disappearance.
