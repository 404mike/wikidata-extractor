He was born in Halesowen and attended Halesowen Grammar School.\nBradley made his debut against Combined Services at Worcester in June 1951, and though he did not bowl in the first innings, he claimed 3-84 in the second; his third wicket was that of Jim Parks. A couple of weeks later he played against Scotland and took five wickets in the match. In the second innings of this game Hugo Yarnold stumped six Scottish batsmen \u2014 this remains a first-class record \u2014 and Bradley took two of those wickets. (Yarnold also caught another man in the same innings off Bradley's bowling.)\nIn 1952 Bradley appeared seven times for Worcestershire, taking 15 wickets in all, but at an expensive average of 49.73, with six of those successes coming in a single stint against Nottinghamshire in June: in Notts' only innings, his final analysis was 63.3-20-162-6. Aside from this, only in his first game of the season (against Oxford University) did he take more than one wicket in any innings, and he bowed out of the first-class game with a return of 20-0-80-0 against Middlesex in early July.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Bradley", "response": ["*Michael Bradley (politician) (died 1923), Irish politician", "*Michael Bradley (rugby union, born 1897) (1897\u20131951), Irish and British Lions rugby union player", "*Michael Bradley (cricketer) (born 1934), English cricketer", "*Michael Bradley (rugby union, born 1962), Irish former rugby union player and coach of Edinburgh Rugby", "*Michael Bradley (golfer) (born 1966), American professional golfer", "*Michael Bradley (basketball) (born 1979), American basketball player", "*Michael Bradley (soccer) (born 1987), American soccer player", "*Michael Bradley (businessman), British businessman, chief executive of Defence Equipment and Support", "*Michael Bradley (musician) (born 1959), bassist for The Undertones", "*Michael Bradley (singer), former lead singer of Paul Revere & the Raiders and composer (Robotech)"]}, {"page": "The Earls High School", "response": ["* Michael Bradley, cricketer"]}]}}
