In White's opinion, autocracy is the defining factor in the history of Russian politics.Nicolai N.

Petro and Martin Malia (as cited by Hoffmann). Richard Pipes is another influential historian among non-specialists who holds the position about the distinctness of Russian history and political system, describing the absolutism of the Muscovite political system as \"patrimonial\", and saw the stability of the Soviet Union in the fact that Russians accepted the legitimacy of this patrimonial organization."]}, {"page": "December 1921", "response": ["*The Kingdom of Italy signed its first trade agreement with the Soviet Union, a prelude to full diplomatic recognition with the Communist government in 1924.

According to anti-communist academic Richard Pipes and political scientist Stephen White, this paved the groundwork for the development of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union after the October Revolution, describing the fabric of Russian identity being interwoven with autocracy. This progression of autocratic governments did not allow for the spread and rapid development of liberal ideals as seen in Western Europe, with state interventionism remaining the key ideology in all Russian parties. This influenced the development of conservative thought post the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, with state control playing a key role in Russian traditionalism."]}, {"page": "Journal of Eurasian Studies", "response": ["*Gu Ho Eom and Stephen White (current)"]}]}}
