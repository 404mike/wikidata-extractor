Reports by some early European explorers including Quir\u00f3s include attempts to trascribe notable Tahitian words heard during initial interactions with the indigenous people of Marquesa. Aboard the Endeavour, Lt. James Cook and the ship's master, Robert Molyneux, transcribed the names of 72 and 55 islands respectively as recited by the Tahitian arioi, Tupaia. Many of these were \"non-geographic\" or \"ghost islands\" of Polynesian mythology and all were transcribed using phonetic English spelling. In 1797, Protestant missionaries arrived in Tahiti on a British ship called Duff, captained by James Wilson. Among the missionaries was Henry Nott (1774\u20131844) who learned the Tahitian language and worked with P\u014dmare II, a Tahitian king, and the Welsh missionary, John Davies (1772-1855), to translate the Bible into Tahitian. A system of five vowels and nine consonants was adopted for the Tahitian Bible, which would become the key text by which many Polynesians would learn to read and write. John Davies's spelling book (1810) was the first book to be printed in the Tahitian language. He also published a grammar and a dictionary of that language."]}, {"page": "P\u014dmare II", "response": ["Pomare II believed that he lost favor with the god 'Oro, and, aided by the missionary Henry Nott, he began paying more attention to the God of the Christians."]}, {"page": "P\u014dmare III", "response": ["The British missionaries decided that Pomare should have a coronation, although Tahitian tradition required investment with a sacred girdle and did not involve the use of a crown. The coronation was arranged by the British missionary Henry Nott and involved a procession of Tahitian judges and other dignitaries as well as British missionaries, accompanying the infant king, seated in a covered chair, to a specially-constructed stone platform. Here he sat behind a table carrying a crown, a bible and a book of Tahitian law. Mr Davies, a senior missionary, spoke on his behalf, confirming that he agreed to reign with justice and mercy, according to the law and the word of God. Not then placed the crown on his head."]}, {"page": "List of people on the postage stamps of French Polynesia", "response": ["*Henry Nott (1988)"]}, {"page": "Joyce Reason", "response": ["Reason wrote missionary biographies of Mary Aldersey of China,Joyce Reason, The Witch of Ningpo: Mary Aldersey.
