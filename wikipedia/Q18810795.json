Independently the Lytham & St Annes Golf Club, who had not been sent the circular, decided to organise a ladies' championship. On becoming aware of this, the Lytham club was invited to attend the meeting of the new union. The outcome was that it was decided to hold the first ladies' championship at the Lytham club, under the auspices of the newly founded Ladies' Golf Union. The championship was held from Tuesday 13 to Thursday 15 June. It was played on the ladies links of the Lytham & St Annes Golf Club, a 9-hole course. This was on the Mayfield Road site which the club used before moving to its present location in 1896. There were 38 entries, requiring 6 knock-out rounds. Two rounds were played per day with the semi-finals and final played on the Thursday. All matches were over 18 holes, with extra holes played to ensure a result. The winner received the championship cup valued at 50 guineas. In addition the winner received a gold medal, the runner-up a silver one and the two semi-finalists received bronze medals.

In 1872, the Wimbledon Golf Club had laid out a nine-hole course for women and created the Wimbledon Ladies Golf Club. Purves arranged and presided over a meeting of the 15 ladies' golf clubs in the UK in 1893 which led to the formation of the Ladies' Golf Union (LGU) later that year. Issette Pearson, a Wimbledon Ladies member, was its first secretary. The support of Purves was described as crucial in its foundation and Amy Pascoe, who won the Ladies Championship in 1896, described Purves as the \"fairy godfather of ladies' golf\".", "Purves, Henry Lamb and Issette Pearson were the three key figures in the introduction of the system of handicap into the UK. The golf historian C.B. Clapcott in his History of Handicapping wrote that \"Dr. Laidlaw Purves set out the rules for universal handicapping (1898) which were evolved at Wimbledon. These rules indeed may be regarded as the basis upon which the British Golf Union's Joint Advisory Council have built up their system of uniform handicapping (average of the best three scores over two years of medal scores with compulsory handing in of signed scorecards)\". The LGU adopted the system before the British Golf Union adopted them for men and also developed a system of course rating. Issette Pearson appointed 'handicap advisers' who visited LGU clubs giving standard scratch score ratings to the courses. In 1898 Purves with Henry Lamb and Issette Pearson were at the forefront of the introduction of similar standards in British men's golf."]}, {"page": "Mabel Stringer", "response": ["In 1894 whilst she was still captain the second national ladies' golf championship was hosted at Littlestone.
