In 1872, the Wimbledon Golf Club had laid out a nine-hole course for women and created the Wimbledon Ladies Golf Club. Purves arranged and presided over a meeting of the 15 ladies' golf clubs in the UK in 1893 which led to the formation of the Ladies' Golf Union (LGU) later that year. Issette Pearson, a Wimbledon Ladies member, was its first secretary. The support of Purves was described as crucial in its foundation and Amy Pascoe, who won the Ladies Championship in 1896, described Purves as the \"fairy godfather of ladies' golf\".", "Purves, Henry Lamb and Issette Pearson were the three key figures in the introduction of the system of handicap into the UK. The golf historian C.B. Clapcott in his History of Handicapping wrote that \"Dr. Laidlaw Purves set out the rules for universal handicapping (1898) which were evolved at Wimbledon. These rules indeed may be regarded as the basis upon which the British Golf Union's Joint Advisory Council have built up their system of uniform handicapping (average of the best three scores over two years of medal scores with compulsory handing in of signed scorecards)\". The LGU adopted the system before the British Golf Union adopted them for men and also developed a system of course rating. Issette Pearson appointed 'handicap advisers' who visited LGU clubs giving standard scratch score ratings to the courses. In 1898 Purves with Henry Lamb and Issette Pearson were at the forefront of the introduction of similar standards in British men's golf."]}, {"page": "Mabel Stringer", "response": ["In 1894 whilst she was still captain the second national ladies' golf championship was hosted at Littlestone. Stringer was unaware of the championship until she hosted the Ladies' Golf Union's secretary  Issette Pearson when she came to Littlestone to inspect the course. Stringer beat her on their first game together and they became friends and colleagues. Pearson was a runner up that year and Stringer made her debut at a national championship. The golfers played in leather bound skirts and hats and were required to change in a corrugated iron building as women were not allowed in the clubhouse."]}]}}
