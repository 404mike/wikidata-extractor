He became a regular at Ashton Gate and went on to stay for seven years making 221 appearances including short loan spells with Stoke City and Shrewsbury Town. He left Bristol City in 1997 and joined Blackpool where he stayed for three seasons before entering non-league football with Kettering Town and Lancaster City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["Smith rebuilt the defence for 1993\u201394, signing right-back Brian Mitchell and centre-back David Thompson, and oversaw a mixed start to the season. City won four straight home matches but also lost 5\u20131 to West Ham, 5\u20130 at Newcastle, and most significantly 4\u20130 to local rivals Bristol Rovers at Twerton Park. He found it difficult to control the club's talented and popular players, as Dziekanowski regularly got into trouble in his social life and skilled left-winger Junior Bent was unwilling to deliver crosses as regularly as Smith demanded. He tried to sell Bent but was unable to have the deal sanctioned by the club's directors. His relationship with the board was poor and he found himself regularly undermined and sensitive boardroom discussions were leaked. He also tried to sell Cole in order to provide funds to restructure the first team but again the board refused to sanction the deal. He was dismissed on 21 January 1993 following a run of 10 matches without a victory, and his assistant Russell Osman was appointed as his successor."]}, {"page": "Bent (surname)", "response": ["* Junior Bent (born 1970), English football (soccer) player"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Junior Bent||||MF||6 (1)||1||0||0||1||0||1||0||8 (1)||1"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Junior Bent||||MF||14 (8)||5||3||1||0||0||2||0||19 (8)||6"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Junior Bent||||MF||5 (2)||0||0 (1)||0||0||0||0||0||5 (3)||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Junior Bent||||1985\u20131990||25 (11)||6||3 (1)||1||1||0||1||0||0||0||30 (12)||7"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Junior Bent"]}, {"page": "Junior (name)", "response": ["* Junior Bent (born 1970), English former footballer "]}, {"page": "Cory Bent", "response": ["Bent is the son of former footballer Junior Bent, as well as a cousin of former footballer Darren Bent."]}]}}
