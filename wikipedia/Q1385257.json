He competes in the T13 disability sport classification as he is legally blind, with his central vision being affected by Stargardt's disease; he also competes in elite non-Paralympic competition. As of July 2014, Smyth holds T13 World records in the 100m and 200m events. He was selected to represent Northern Ireland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Deterioration in his vision meant that he was reassigned to the T12 classification in 2014, but he was subsequently reclassified back to T13 in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2012 Summer Paralympics", "response": ["| align=left| Jason Smyth"]}, {"page": "List of Latter Day Saints", "response": ["* Jason Smyth, blind Irish athlete who won four gold medals in the Paralympics"]}, {"page": "100 metres", "response": ["| Jason Smyth"]}, {"page": "Jason Smith", "response": ["*Jason Smyth (born 1987), Irish sprinter"]}, {"page": "London Stadium", "response": ["The stadium also hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Paralympic Games.
