She has a low opinion of Lance's staff, referring to Ashley as a \"Shithouse\" and Christopher as a \"Creepy little cunt.\" For a time, she becomes close friends with Janine and takes her on a whirlwind tour of alcohol fueled late nights in Sutton, but the friendship ends when Shelley demands Janine prove her loyalty by joining her in a sex session with a group of male escorts which turn out to be two regulars from the local pub \u2013 Les and \"Wheelchair\" Dave \u2013 dressed in navy dress uniform (\"ones\"), causing Janine to almost vomit at the prospect.
