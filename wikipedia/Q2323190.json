Beginning his career as a political commentator, he subsequently edited The Independent newspaper (1996\u20131998) and was political editor of BBC News (2000\u20132005).  He began hosting a political programme\u2014Sunday AM, later called The Andrew Marr Show\u2014on Sunday mornings on BBC One from September 2005 until he left the BBC in December 2021.  In 2002, Marr took over as host of BBC Radio 4's long-running Start the Week Monday morning discussion programme.\nIn 2007, he presented Andrew Marr's History of Modern Britain, a BBC Two documentary series on the political history of post-war Britain, which was followed by a prequel in 2009, Andrew Marr's The Making of Modern Britain, focusing on the period between 1901 and 1945. In 2010, he presented a series, Andrew Marr's Megacities (the title distinguishes it from another Megacities series), examining the life, development and challenges of some of the largest cities in the world.\nIn early 2012, he presented The Diamond Queen, a three-part series about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. In late September 2012, Marr began presenting Andrew Marr's History of the World, a series examining the history of human civilisation.\nFollowing a stroke in January 2013, Marr was in hospital for two months.

These reforms would not have happened when they did, earlier than in most other European countries, if Jenkins had not supported them.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 298. In a speech in Abingdon in July 1969, Jenkins said that the \"permissive society\" had been allowed to become a dirty phrase: \"A better phrase is the 'civilized society', based on the belief that different individuals will wish to make different decisions about their patterns of behaviour and that, provided these do not restrict the freedom of others, they should be allowed to do so within a framework of understanding and tolerance\".'Chancellor sees no cause for gloom', The Times (21 July 1969), p. 3. Jenkins' words were immediately reported in the press as \"The permissive society is the civilised society\", which he later wrote \"was not all that far from my meaning\".Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 299.", "By May 1969 Britain's current account position was in surplus, thanks to a growth in exports, a drop in overall consumption and, in part, the Inland Revenue correcting a previous underestimation in export figures. In July Jenkins was also able to announce that the size of Britain's foreign currency reserves had been increased by almost $1\u00a0billion since the beginning of the year. It was at this time that he presided over Britain's only excess of government revenue over expenditure in the period 1936\u20137 to 1987\u20138.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 341\u2013342. Thanks in part to these successes there was a high expectation that the 1970 budget would be a more generous one. Jenkins, however, was cautious about the stability of Britain's recovery and decided to present a more muted and fiscally neutral budget. It is often argued that this, combined with a series of bad trade figures, contributed to the Conservative victory at the 1970 general election. Historians and economists have often praised Jenkins for presiding over the transformation in Britain's fiscal and current account positions towards the end of the 1960s. Andrew Marr, for example, described him as one of the 20th century's \"most successful chancellors\".

He adds that the area bombing campaign was no more reprehensible than President Truman's use of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki six months later.
