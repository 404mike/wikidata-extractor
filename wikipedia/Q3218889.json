He then took up residence in the Westminster School boarding house, owned by his adored \"Aunt Kitty\", Catherine Porten.  Soon after she died in 1786, he remembered her as rescuing him from his mother's disdain, and imparting \"the first rudiments of knowledge, the first exercise of reason, and a taste for books which is still the pleasure and glory of my life\".Norton, Letters, vol. 3, 10/5/[17]86, 45\u201348.

In Governor William Bradford's Dialogue (1648), he referred to synods of a separatist church as \"classical meetings\", defined by meetings between \"young men\" from New England and \"ancient men\" from Holland and England. In 1715, Laurence Echard's Classical Geographical Dictionary was published. In 1736, Robert Ainsworth's Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Compendarius turned English words and expressions into \"proper and classical Latin.\" In 1768, David Ruhnken's Critical History of the Greek Orators recast the molded view of the classical by applying the word \"canon\" to the pinakes of orators after the Biblical canon, or list of authentic books of the Bible.
