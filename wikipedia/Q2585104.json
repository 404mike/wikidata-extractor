As\u00edn inferred his school's original teachings based on, for example, medieval biographers (al-Faradi, al-Dabbi, Ibn Khaqan, and al-Maqqari [III:32,n.6]), two Iberian commentators (Ibn Hazm, and Sa'id of Toledo) [IV:43; VI:73], and on the writings of his followers (in particular Ibn 'Arabi) [IV:43-44; VI:73] and of his adversaries.Subsequently, two manuscripts of Ibn Masarra have been located (Kitab al-huruf [Book of Letters], & Kitab al-tabsira [Book of Clear Explanation]); very recently both have been translated into Spanish by Pilar Garrido. Cf., P. Garrido, \"The Science of Letters in Ibn Massara\" in Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society 47: 47-61, at 48. As\u00edn [Mys. Phil. at III:41,n.23] knew of these titles only from references to them by others, for example, Ibn Hazm.These works of Ibn Masarra are discussed by Claude Addas, \"Andalusi Mysticism and the Rise of Ibn 'Arabi\" at 909-933, 916-918, in The Legacy of Muslim Spain (Leiden: E. J. Brill 1992), edited by Salma Khadra Jayyusi.  As\u00edn discusses the Batini, the Mutazili, the Shi'a, the Sufi, the Greco-Roman mystic Plotinus (205-270), and Pseudo-Empedocles in particular.As\u00edn's theory that the pseudo-Empedocles was a source for Ibn Masarra's teachings has been challenged. Cf., Claude Addas, her Ibn 'Arabi ou La qu\u00e9te du Soufre Rouge (Paris: Editions Gallimard 1989), translated by Peter Kingsley as Quest for the Red Sulphur. The Life of Ibn 'Arabi (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 57-58, and the article by the Ismaili scholar Samuel Miklos Stern, cited there at note 113. Elsewhere Addas states, \"[T]he possible influence exerted by Eastern [Muslim] mystics on Ibn Masarra [is] a more decisive influence, in my view, than any pseudo-Empedocles might have had.\" Addas, \"Andalusi Mysiticism and the rise of Ibn 'Arabi\" at 909-933, 914, 918, in The Legacy of Muslim Spain (Leiden: Brill 1992).But compare the pseudo-Empedocles named by Shem Tob Falaquera (1225-1290) in discussing Ibn Gabirol (1021-1058), cited by Isaac Husik in his A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1941), at 60-61, 64. Mentioned several times by As\u00edn is a perspective he favored: eastern Christianity's early influence on the young religion before Islam's arrival in the west.As\u00edn, Abenmasarra y su escuela (1914), translated as The Mystical Philosophy of Ibn Masarra and his Followers (1978), for example, at 2-3, 12-13, 28, 88-89, 91 (and in As\u00edn's prior works referenced at 12, footnote 25).Confirmation of As\u00edn's perspective appears to be given in a later book by the scholar Margaret Smith, Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at Chap.VI, 103-124.Cf., R.C.Zaehner, Hindu and Muslim Mysticism (Univ.of London 1960; reprints: Schocken 1969, Oneworld 1994) at 86-87, 92, 112. As\u00edn infers that Ibn Masarra's school influenced Ibn al-Arif (1088\u20131141) of Almer\u00eda.As\u00edn's inference is based on an admitted dearth of 10th-century sources but indirectly on later Muslims of al-Andalus, i.e., on Ibn 'Arabi, whose own early writings drew heavily on the circle formed by Ibn al'Arif. As\u00edn, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:122-123. This Ibn al-'Arif became the focus of an emerging Sufi circle later called the muridin. His followers spread out over al-Andalus, but they became too strong in the opinion of the governing power;One muridin shaikh managed to set up a rival government in the Algarves. This Abu 'l-Qasim \"demonstrated how easily spiritual power can aspire to mundane power when he rose from his rabat [fort], [the year Ibn al-Arif died], and subjected [lands in Southern Portugal] before he was killed in 546/1151.\" Trimingham, The Sufi Orders in Islam (1971) at 46. they were variously suppressed by the Almoravids who then ruled al-Andalus from Marrakech.As\u00edn, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:121-123 (Ibn al-'Arif and his circle). The Berber Almoravids deported Ibn al-'Arif to Marrakech, where he was accused of heterodoxy and died in 1141. His follower Ibn Qasi managed to escape, to organize adepts into a militia under the mystic name muridin, and to prosecute a sustained revolt. Ibid. at VIII:122. As\u00edn then discusses the influence of the school on Jewish figures of al-Andalus, for example, Judah ha-Levi (c. 1085-c. 1140),Cf., Isaak Heinemann, editor, \"Jehuda Halevi: Kusari\", in Three Jewish Philosophers (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America c. 1946; reprint by Atheneum 1969). and in particular on Solomon ibn Gabirol (c. 1021-1058), known in Latin as Avicebron.As\u00edn, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:130-131 (ibn Gabirol, aka Avicebron) and 129 (Judah ha-Levi).Cf., Isaac Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1941) at 59-79 (Solomon ibn Gabirol), and 150-183 (Judah Halevi). Ibn Gabirol wrote in Arabic the book Fons Vitae which still survives.Fons Vitae being the book's well-known title in its Latin translation, meaning \"Fountain of Life\". It apparently shows clear neo-Platonic references to the school of Ibn Masarra.As\u00edn, The Mystical Philosophy (1914, 1978) at VIII:130-131. Regarding Ibn Gabirol, As\u00edn cites to the near contemporary writings of Shem-Tob b. Joseph Falaquera, and also references to 19th-century scholarship by David Kaufmann, Studien \u00fcber Salomon Ibn Gabirol (Budapest 1899) at 52-58, and Solomon Munk, M\u00e9langes de Philosophie Juive et Arabe (Paris 1859) at 241 [generally 151-306]. Munk made the then surprising discovery that it was Ibn Gabirol who wrote the Fons Vitae. As\u00edn (1914, 1978) at VIII:130.Husik, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy (1941) at 60, 63-64.", "In his introduction, As\u00edn observes that while Christian Spain later became deeply influenced by Muslim mysticism, previously the oriental Church had equally influenced early Islam.Miguel As\u00edn Palacios, El Islam cristianizado (Madrid: Editorial Plutarco 1931; reprint Ediciones Hiperi\u00f3n 1990), for example, at 12-13. Also, As\u00edn Palacios, \"Influencias evang\u00e9licas en la Literatura religiosa del Islam\" at 8-27, in A volume of oriental studies dedicated to Edward G. Browne (Cambridge Univ. 1922), edited by T. W. Arnold and Reynold A. Nicholson.The same year Margaret Smith described this Christian influence on early Islam in some detail in her Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at chapters VI, VII, and XI. (This book also said to be reissued in 1976 as The Way of the Mystics, reprint Oxford Univ. 1978). Islam then arrived in the far west, the Maghreb al-Aksa and Andalusia, where Ibn 'Arabi would be born. From the perspective of religious studies, it might be said that As\u00edn Palacios here presents us with a multidimensional, polyphonic text for comparative religion. In his other works on Sufi practice, As\u00edn mentions precursors of Ibn 'Arabi in al-Andalus (i.e., the school of Ibn Masarra), as well as those who drew on his teachings afterwards (for example, the tariqah of the Sadilies [or xadil\u00edes]).El Islam cristianizado at 171-174; cf. \"Selected Publications\" below (for example, Abenmasarra y su escuela, and Sadilies y alumbrados).
