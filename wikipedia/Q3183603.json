As the club awaited completion of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long's replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing an uphill battle on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their 6th consecutive Grand Final. However, for the 5th year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of a new crop of talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell stepping up to fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances."]}, {"page": "Billinge, Merseyside", "response": ["*Jonny Lomax, England and Great Britain professional rugby league player"]}, {"page": "Super League Dream Team", "response": ["| Jonny Lomax", "| Jonny Lomax", "| Jonny Lomax"]}, {"page": "Kyle Eastmond", "response": ["On 16 March 2011 it was announced on the St. Helens website that he had been suspended by the club pending an investigation into serious misconduct. The club followed this up by saying that no further comments were to be made until the completion of the investigation. It was later confirmed by the club that he had made an inappropriate gesture to his home fans, and it was unlikely he would ever play in the \u2018Red V\u2019 again, especially after the emergence of scrum-half sensation Jonny Lomax, and stand-off Lee Gaskell. He was dropped to the under-18s team but after injuries struck Saints, Eastmond was called on to fill in. He had to play under difficult circumstances, with Saints fans booing him with every touch of the ball. Despite this, he made a decent return. In July 2011 he successfully made the switch from the halfbacks to fullback, scoring 2 tries against Wakefield Trinity on 9 July. After that, Eastmond regained his confidence and was playing in a similar way to the 2008-09 seasons. He managed 15 appearances and scored 5 tries, but his workload was reduced to just 4 goal kicks (3 missed kicks), due to Jamie Foster replacing him as the club's kicker."]}, {"page": "List of St Helens R.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"  |Jonny Lomax"]}, {"page": "Albert Goldthorpe Medal", "response": ["|2019St Helens dominate 2019 Albert Goldthorpe Medal Rankings, totalrl.com, consult\u00e9 le 6 octobre 2019.|| Jonny Lomax ( - St. Helens) ||  Jackson Hastings( - Salford) ||  Lachlan Coote( - St. Helens)"]}, {"page": "Man of Steel Awards", "response": ["| Jonny Lomax"]}, {"page": "2009 St Helens RLFC season", "response": ["|Jonny Lomax"]}, {"page": "Super League", "response": ["| Jonny Lomax"]}, {"page": "List of St Helens R.F.C. international players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"  |Jonny Lomax"]}, {"page": "Rainford High School", "response": ["* Jonny Lomax, rugby league footballer for St. Helens"]}, {"page": "2010 St Helens RLFC season", "response": ["The game will see former talismanic scrum-half and captain Sean Long return to Knowsley Road with his new side Hull; ironically as captain. The St Helens squad sees Francis Meli absent as the big Kiwi and Samoa wing is in his native Samoa on compassionate grounds. His place is likely to be taken by Gary Wheeler or Jonny Lomax.

However, it was the Dragons who got the better of the opening exchanges, with Setaimata Sa and Chris Walker going over inside the first ten minutes. Neither scores were converted, but Catalans had an 8-0 lead. However, on the 15 minute mark, Saints found their cutting edge and began to tick, with young winger Jonny Lomax latching on to an inch-perfect Paul Wellens chip. Despite James Graham being off the field with  suspected concussion and Jonny Lomax being caught by a dangerous tackle by Olivier Elima which resulted in the French captain's sending off, St Helens pressed on and it was Lomax, who shrugged off the shot from Elima to cut inside his opposing winger to score a brilliant try. Kyle Eastmond scored a goal from the touchline for a 10-8 St Helens lead, and with the extra man advantage, it was looking ominous for the Dragons. Francis Meli got his first of the season after a fine kick form the in-form Leon Pryce, and shortly after, Matt Gidley cut back inside his winger to finish a fine move for the first of his two tries of the evening. Half-time - 8-18 to Saints. The second-half continued in a similar guise, with Maurie Fa'asavalu scoring a trade-mark, barnstorming try under the posts. Eastmond was next to score, Gidley cutting through the defence and flicking the ball back on the inside to Eastmond who sped 30 meters for a fine try. Meli then crossed for his second, finishing well a break from Matty Ashurst. Gidley then got his brace, with a trademark, show and go on the outside to score. That was the end of the St Helens scoring, but by no means the end of the action, with Bryn Hargreaves and Scott Moore involved in a brawl with the Catalans forwards. Walker got his second with five minutes remaining, but the win was in the bag by the hour mark.", "St Helens made it three consecutive wins with a hard-fought if scrappy win over the in-form Wakefield. Despite a strong, assured start from the Drednaughts with tries from Daryl Millard and young Dale Morton inside the first ten minutes, St Helens finally got going and got onto the scoreboard on 27 minutes with Jonny Lomax notching his third in four games. They continued to apply the pressure in the second half with scores from Kyle Eastmond, Francis Meli and Keiron Cunningham scoring on this landmark game for the hooker. Wakefield applied pressure late on with Millard getting his second, but St Helens held on for the win."]}, {"page": "2010 Super League Grand Final", "response": ["||  Jonny Lomax"]}]}}
