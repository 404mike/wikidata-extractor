In June of that year she was the chairman of one of the platforms at the Hyde Park rally, but the work took its toll on her health and shortly afterwards she was forced to temporarily step down from her position to recuperate, which included a period of time at a sanatorium. After recovering she moved closer to home, volunteering for Annie Kenney in Bristol. She soon agreed to resume her role as a paid organiser for he WSPU and was sent to Newport in south-east Wales to continue her duties. In 1910 Barrett was chosen to lead a group of women to talk to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, regarding the Liberal Party's role in supporting the first Conciliation Bill. The meeting lasted two and a half hours, and by its end she was convinced that Lloyd George had been insincere over his support for equal voting rights and believed him to be against women's suffrage. By the end of the year her post was changed to organising all WSPU activities in Wales and she was relocated to the country's headquarters in Cardiff. According to Ryland Wallace, writing in 2009, \"No individual worked harder than Rachel Barrett to promote the campaign in Wales.\""]}, {"page": "Moyes", "response": ["*Helen Fraser (feminist), later Moyes (1881\u20131979), Scottish suffragist, feminist, educationalist, politician emigrated to Australia, toured America to develop WWI Women's Land Army"]}, {"page": "Isabella Fyvie Mayo", "response": ["In 1870, Isabella married John Ryall Mayo, a London lawyer, who in 1854, became the first mayor of Yeovil. Fyvie Mayo's husband was in delicate health, which made travel imperative, and this led to a Canadian tour, followed by residence in Surrey, of which there are glimpses in some of her stories. In 1877, Fyvie Mayo became a widow, left with one son. In the following year, Fyvie Mayo left London, which had then grown unendurable to her.  At first, she was in danger of lapsing into invalidism, but her health improved after moving to Aberdeen. There Fyvie Mayo got involved in the debates in the women's suffrage movement between those she called the 'suffragists of the old school' and the militant WSPU, and the 'singularly effete' local activists linked so closely to the Women's Liberal Association that it was limited to 'one shade of political opinion.' Fyvie Mayo had a range of exchanges as convenor of the local WSPU events, with Emmeline Pankhurst and Helen Fraser, and in the local press with someone calling themselves 'Anti-Suffragette'. The collection of some of her letters are held in the University of Aberdeen archive (women's suffrage) ,  Fyvie Mayo was nominated for a blue memorial plaque in Aberdeen (suffragette Women's Political & Social Union campaigner, writer, translator)."]}, {"page": "Helen (given name)", "response": ["* Helen Fraser (feminist), later Moyes (1881\u20131979), Scottish suffragette, feminist, educationalist, politician emigrated to Australia, toured America to develop  WWI Women's Land Army."]}, {"page": "Holyoke High School", "response": ["On January 21, 1924, the school hosted the first of a series of debates in the United States between feminists Adele Schreiber-Krieger of Weimar Germany and Helen Fraser of the United Kingdom, under the topic \"That the Hope of Civilization Depends Upon the Continued Growth of Labor Parties Throughout the World\" with Schreiber arguing for and Fraser countering."]}, {"page": "1922 in Scotland", "response": ["* 15 November \u2013 1922 UK general election.
