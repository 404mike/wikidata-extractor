Heseltine was in close touch with President of the European Commission Jacques Delors, who paid a 3-hour visit to his Victoria office, diplomats Nicholas Henderson and Antony Acland and economist Christopher Johnson, who is thought to have persuaded him of the merits of European monetary union. The book won a \u00a310,000 Adolphe Bentincke prize for advancing European unity. Heseltine was a qualified supporter of the social charter (a stronger precursor to the Social Chapter from which John Major would later opt out in the Maastricht Treaty). He was seen as devoted to Europe as a matter of what he perceived as Britain's self-interest, not on an emotional level like Edward Heath, Roy Jenkins or Ken Clarke.Crick 1997, pp. 309\u201313."]}, {"page": "On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)", "response": ["On Her Majesty's Secret Service was written in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1962, whilst the first Bond film, Dr. No, was being filmed nearby.

Outside of Austria, foreign press coverage tended to be hostile towards Nolte, with the fiercest criticism coming from Israel. In 1988, an entire edition of Yad Vashem Studies, the journal of the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem, was devoted to the Historikerstreit. A year earlier, in 1987, concerns about some of the claims being made by both sides in the Historikerstreit led to a conference being called in London that was attended by some of the leading British, American, Israeli, and German specialists in both Soviet and German history. Among those who attended included Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, Sir Isaiah Berlin, Lord Weidenfeld, Harold James, Carol Gluck, Lord Annan, Fritz Stern, Gordon A. Craig, Robert Conquest, Samuel Ettinger, J\u00fcrgen Kocka, Sir Nicholas Henderson, Eberhard J\u00e4ckel, Hans Mommsen, Michael St\u00fcrmer, Joachim Fest, Hagen Schulze, Christian Maier, Wolfgang Mommsen, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Saul Friedl\u00e4nder, Felix Gilbert, Norman Stone, Julius Schoeps, and Charles S. Maier.Thomas, pp. vii\u2013viii Nolte was invited to the conference, but declined, citing scheduling conflicts. The Israeli historian Samuel Ettinger described Nolte as someone who wrote about Soviet history despite not being a Soviet specialist.Thomas, p. 27 Ettinger went to say about Nolte:\u201cQuotations from Latsis, who was First Cheka Chief; Tucholsky, the satirist and journalist, and Theodore Kaufmann (who knows who Theodore Kaufmann was?) were used as historical sources. Can an assorted collection of this kind serve as a basis for serious scholarly analysis, the starting point for the claim that poor Hitler was so frightened by the \u201cAsiatic deeds\u201d of the Bolsheviks that he started to exterminate Jewish children? All this without taking into account the historical development of the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, the military co-operation during the twenties which as well known to the German General Staff and to Hitler, Tukhachevsky's speech in 1935 was applauded at a meeting of the General Staff of Germany for its anti-Western remarks. Then there are the negotiations between Stalin and Hitler from \u201936 and \u201937 onwards which brought a rapprochement and led to the dismissal of Jewish diplomats and other public officials until the division of Poland in 1939\u201d.Thomas, pp. 27\u201328 The Anglo-American historian of Stalin's terror, Robert Conquest was quoted as saying about Nolte's theories:\u201cI think we all accept the proposition that Nazi crimes were unique and uniquely horrible, that they were a reaction against the Communist terrors seems untenable. It is conceivable that support for the National Socialists may largely have come as a reaction to Lenin's international civil war launched in 1918, but the actual crimes of the Holocaust are of a totally different nature from Stalin's crimes and I see no connection whatever. But although there is no causative connection, comparisons can still be made\u201d.Thomas, p. 48 Lord Annan was quoted as saying \"Nolte's article may have been sinister, even malevolent, but we have had a great example of an informed debate, of great heart-searching and of a profound examination of the nature of Germany's past and present\"\u201d.Thomas, p. 39 The German historian Julius Schoeps stated:\"I would like stress a seminal factor in the Historikerstreit: The historians who caused this dispute are men in their sixties, that is, men who were old enough to be in the Hitler Youth, Hitlerjugend; men who were perhaps soldiers in the war; men for whom the collapse of the Third Reich turned into a trauma which is inextricably linked to the key terms Holocaust and Auschwitz. Nolte's reaction is, I think, typical of this generation of scholars. Contrary to some historians who assert that Germans should not ask such questions at all, I believe that Germans must ask them. But there is no need for slanted questions and ambiguous statements which whitewash German history. Unfortunately, questions of this kind were posed in the Historikerstreit; such assertions were made. If historians are suggesting today that Hitler had the right to intern the Jews, they may be tempted to suggest tomorrow that he had the right to kill the Jews. That is why it is crucial to discuss such moral, political, ethical lies\".Thomas, p. 29 During the course of the debate, Eberhard J\u00e4ckel and Joachim Fest again clashed over the question of the \"singularity\" of the Holocaust with Fest accusing J\u00e4ckel of presenting a \"caricature\" of his opponents.Thomas, p. 87"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France", "response": ["*1975\u20131979: Sir Nicholas Henderson"]}, {"page": "Lord Warden of the Stannaries", "response": ["* 1985 Sir Nicholas Henderson"]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Germany", "response": ["*1972\u20131975: Sir Nicholas Henderson"]}, {"page": "Henderson (surname)", "response": ["*Nicholas Henderson, British diplomat"]}, {"page": "European-Atlantic Group", "response": ["The President and co-founder was the Earl of Bessborough, D.L., and there was an impressive list of Vice-Presidents, including The Marquess of Lansdowne, the Earl of Limerick, The Earl Jellicoe, The Lord Carrington, The Lord Chalfont, The Lord Shawcross, The Lord Granchester, Sir Nicholas Henderson, Sir Frederic Bennett, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, Bt., General Sir Harry Tuzo, and Douglas Fairbanks junior.
