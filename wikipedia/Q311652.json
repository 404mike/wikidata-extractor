Three days later, on 30 January 1820, a British expedition captained by Irishman Edward Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, and ten months later an American sealer Nathaniel Palmer sighted Antarctica on 17 November 1820.

On this voyage, he sailed over  farther north than his predecessor John Davis: since his voyages seemed to preclude hope of an ice-free nautical path to the Orient, the area was not explored again for two centuries and his furthest north (about  remained unsurpassed in North America until the Royal Navy officer Edward Augustus Inglefield reached  in the same area in 1852."]}]}}
