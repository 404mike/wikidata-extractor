The band met up with DJ Andrew Weatherall at a rave, and he was given a copy of \"I'm Losing More Than I'll Ever Have\", a track from Primal Scream, to remix for one of his shows. Weatherall added a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell's \"What I Am\", a sample of Gillespie singing a line from Robert Johnson's \"Terraplane Blues\" and the central introductory sample from the Peter Fonda B-movie The Wild Angels.

The arrival of Mani revitalized the group, who were considering disbanding after the failure of Give Out.

The album, like many of Primal Scream's previous albums, had multiple producers. Shields produced several tracks, and Andrew Weatherall produced three tracks, his first work with the band since Vanishing Point. Kate Moss sang professionally for the first time with single \"Some Velvet Morning\", a version of the Lee Hazlewood/Nancy Sinatra song.
