Taylor's decision to wear the shirt to a press conference drew criticism from a number of commentators, who saw a reflection of a culture where women are unwelcome in scientific fields (see gender inequality). Others, including Boris Johnson, Julie Bindel Op-Ed. and Tim Stanley, made arguments against this criticism. The woman who made the shirt for Taylor as a birthday present stated that she \"did not expect\" the shirt to attract the level of attention that it did. Taylor later made a public apology, saying: \"The shirt I wore this week \u2013 I made a big mistake, and I offended many people. And I'm very sorry about this\". Some writers expressed appreciation for Taylor's apology. A campaign was set up on the crowdfund website Indiegogo, with the objective of raising $3,000 to buy Taylor a gift, as a token of the public's appreciation for the work that he and the team had done. The campaign raised a total of $24,003, of which $23,000 was donated to UNAWE at Taylor's request, the remainder going towards a plaque commemorating the mission."]}, {"page": "Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards", "response": ["| Matt Taylor || Spirit of Hammer Award || "]}, {"page": "The Jodcast", "response": ["| Matt Taylor||Apr Extra 2015||Philae spacecraft and scientific findings of the Rosetta Mission"]}]}}
