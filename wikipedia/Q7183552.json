During that tour, which also included Hong Kong, she announced she was retiring, and her final recital was at a festival in Stirling, Scotland, on 18 May 1960, where she played two sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, Beethoven's Appassionata sonata, and works by Mendelssohn, Debussy, Chopin, Ravel, Granados and Liszt. She did, however, return to the concert platform a handful of times over the next 21 years, the first not until 1967, when she played Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 with the RPO conducted by Anatole Fistoulari, at the Royal Albert Hall. This was the work that had made her famous in the film Brief Encounter in 1945, and it was to be her last concerto performance. Also in 1967 she appeared with three other harpsichordists and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under Neville Marriner. In 1967 she started to foster the career of the ten-year-old Terence Judd. In 1969 she appeared alongside fellow Australian pianist Geoffrey Parsons in a two-piano recital at Australia House, London. In 1979 she gave a two-piano recital with Philip Fowke. She appeared again with Geoffrey Parsons on 29 November 1981 at a fund-raising concert at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. This proved to be her very last appearance as a pianist (another one was scheduled in 1988 but had to be cancelled).She had planned to play the third piano part in Percy Grainger's The Warriors at a special concert for Australia's Bicentenary on Australia Day 1988, at the Theatre Royal, London, but after practising she had to withdraw due to her stiffened fingers."]}, {"page": "List of classical pianists (recorded)", "response": ["* Philip Fowke"]}, {"page": "Mark Andrew James", "response": ["As well as the standard concerto repertoire, most recently including Beethoven's Emperor Concerto with Philip Fowke and the Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Cello Concerto with Guy Johnston, the orchestra also regularly includes premiere performances of commissioned works by both established and emerging composers, including David Fanshawe, Paul Lewis, Peter Copley and Paul Carr, whose music he has recorded with the orchestra on the \u2018Claudio Records\u2019 label.
