One of the very few active service artists of the Second World War, Worsley was the only person to render contemporary sea-warfare in situ, and the only official war artist captured by the Germans. Detained in the infamous prisoner-of-war camp Marlag O, Worsley documented prison life with supplies provided by the Red Cross, his expertise employed in the forging of identity papers, and an ingenious escape attempt requiring the construction of a mannequin named Albert R.N.During his lifetime, Worsley was president of the Royal Society of Marine Artists: sixty-one of his paintings \u2013 including portraits of Field Marshal Montgomery, and the First Sea Lord, Sir John Cunningham \u2013 hang in the Imperial War Museum, with another twenty-nine pictures archived in the collections of the National Maritime Museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wind in the Willows", "response": ["* The Wind in the Willows, a 1969 TV series adaptation of the story produced by Anglia Television, told by still illustrations by artist John Worsley.
