Although little-remembered today (he does not even have an entry in the comprehensive New Grove dictionary), Austin's orchestral music enjoyed some success in its own time, including performances at the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts and on BBC Radio during the 1920s. He was a prolific composer of songs, covering a wide spectrum of mood, from serious Shakespearean settings to ballads of both sentimental and robust natures. He found some success writing piano pieces and unison songs for children. He also made piano transcriptions of the work of other composers, a particularly common practice of the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 in music", "response": ["*July 24 \u2013 Ernest Austin, English composer, 72"]}, {"page": "The Pilgrim's Progress", "response": ["English composer Ernest Austin set the whole story as a huge narrative tone poem for solo organ, with optional 6-part choir and narrator, lasting approximately 2\u00bd hours."]}, {"page": "1874 in music", "response": ["*December 31 \u2013 Ernest Austin, English composer (d. 1947)"]}, {"page": "1947 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 24 July \u2013 Ernest Austin, composer (born 1874)"]}, {"page": "Piano trio repertoire", "response": ["*Ernest Austin"]}, {"page": "Frederic Austin", "response": ["Frederic William Austin (30 March 187210 April 1952) was an English baritone singer, a musical teacher and composer in the period 1905\u201330.

Gordon recognised a local farmhand, Ernest Austin, thundering past on his horse as he was emerging from the garden with the oranges in hand. Austin spotted Gordon as he rode by, saying \"Good night\", and urging his horse along with a small tree branch. Earlier witnesses had seen Austin with a riding crop, however Gordon claimed he did not have one when he rode past. John Lofft, another local labourer, worked on a property with Austin and the pair shared living quarters. The night Mitchell was murdered, Austin had been in their room scraping at the sole of his boot with a knife, and had asked Lofft \"Where are the pincers kept?\", to which Lofft replied \"In the blacksmith's shop.\" Austin then used the tool to remove the soles from his boots."]}, {"page": "1947 in British music", "response": ["*24 July \u2013 Ernest Austin, composer, 72"]}, {"page": "Ernest Bryson", "response": ["Bryson appears to have studied music with William H.
