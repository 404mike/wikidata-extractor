She has also called these procedures 'child abuse,' 'unethical medicine,' 'mass experimentation,' and a 'global scandal.'\" The Daily Dot further cited a December 2018 article by Joyce in the Australian online magazine Quillette labelling transgender ideology \"the new patriarchy\" and asserting that \"trans radicalism hurts women, children\u2014and trans people themselves.\" GLAAD, called Joyce's statements \"alarming\" and said they have \"no place in a newsroom.\" Joyce responded that Anthony G. Watson, a member of GLAAD's board based in the UK, was conducting an unprovoked harassment campaign against her."]}]}}
