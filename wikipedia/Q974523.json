Prior to his career as a professional mountain biker Peat was employed as a plumber by James Lamb. He is married to Adele Croxon and has two sons, Jake and George Peat.\nPeat began his career with little success riding for the Saracen team alongside Rob Warner, before moving in the mid 1990s to Team MBUK. He rode for GT Bicycles in the late 1990s and for the Orange team between 2002 and 2005, winning the Fort William downhill world cup round in 2005.  He then joined the Santa Cruz Syndicate team for the 2006 season, which saw him finish 1st overall. He continues to race for Santa Cruz Syndicate.\nAs last man down the hill, Peat won the La Bresse downhill world cup round 2 on 10 May 2009 with a time of 02:07.14 knocking Sam Hill out of the hot seat for his 16th world cup round win, tying at the top of the all-time leader-board with Nicolas Vouilloz.  Just one week later on 17 May 2009, at the third round of the UCI World Cup in Vallnord, Peat won again (besting compatriot Gee Atherton by just 0.02 seconds) making him the most successful male downhill mountain bike racer ever by number of wins at the time. This record has since been beaten Peat's South African teammate, Greg Minnaar.\nOther successes include placing second in the Mountain Bike World Championships in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2008. On 6 September 2009, Peat won the World Championships in Canberra for the first time in his career, with a winning time of 2:30.33, just 0.05 seconds ahead of his Santa Cruz team mate Greg Minnaar.  He was crowned World Cup champion in 2002, 2004 and 2006.  He has also won the Lisboa Downhill, held in Lisbon, Portugal, eight times.\nAside from his professional riding career, Peat has other involvements with the sport, including contributing to the design and manufacture of specialist riding clothing made by Royal Racing of which he is part owner. Peat also has involvements with young cyclist academies, and is a proponent of youth involvement in the sport.\nFollowing his recent world champ status he has released his own game 'Steve Peat - Downhill Mountain Biking' for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.\nIn recognition of his accomplishments, Peat was added to Sheffield's 'walk of fame' outside Sheffield Town Hall in 2016. In 2020, Sheffield-based publisher Vertebrate announced they would be releasing Peat's biography in October 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mountain Bike Hall of Fame", "response": ["*Steve Peat"]}, {"page": "Sheffield Hallam University", "response": ["* Steve Peat, World Championship winning downhill mountain biker"]}, {"page": "Kona Bicycle Company", "response": ["Kona has a long-standing tradition in the support of bicycle racing, beginning with their first product designer Joe Murray who was also a two-time US National mountain bike champion.

The extremely steep and technical track seemed almost tailor-made for the young Australian. All seemed to be going well for Hill when he qualified in first place early on race day, besting the second place qualifier by over 14 seconds! Hill was looking confident for Finals. However, with approximately 30 riders left to set off, on arguably the most dangerous course the world cup series has seen in many years, the skies opened up. It had rained every day at this time the whole weekend, but not this hard. Riders who qualified in the top ten, were seen finishing in the late forties, early fifties. When last man to down the track, Hill, set off, no one could believe their eyes. The World Champion at the time was ripping down the track faster than top riders were riding it in the bone dry, perfect conditions. Hill's split time was faster than second place (Steve Peat, who raced in the dry), but a fall later in his run meant the Aussie ended up in a very respectable third position, just 1.63sec off first place rider Matti Lehikoinen, who also completed his final run in the dry. Hill's run will go down in history as one of the greatest runs in the wet, if not one of the greatest ever. Dan Atherton later quoted \"He showed us all that it ain't over, 'till its truly over\". Further, eventual winner Matti Lehikoinen stated after the race \"I played the tactics (referring to a 20-second pause in his practice run, ensuring a lower qualifying position to avoid any unfavourable weather changes), but Sam is the winner of the day. No questions\". Steve Peat said \"Sam is the King \u2013 give him the crown.\" Despite his remarkable and certainly unmatched talent for riding in unfavorable conditions, Sam admits that he rarely rides in the rain. In an interview with Steve Jones of Dirt Magazine featured in the film 'Earthed 5: The Law of Fives', when asked if it rained that hard in Australia and if he was used to riding in such conditions Sam replied \"I don't even see a raindrop when I'm in Australia\". Jones then asked \"So you never ride in the rain?\" Hill's reply was simply, \"My bike gets muddy\".", "Sam Hill came into this race the reigning world champion. With four riders left on the hill Sam Hill started his final run. At the split he was five seconds up and no one could believe how fast he was going, even the commentator, Rob Warner, a former world level racer. Rob Warner yelled \"Look how fast he's going!\", \"It looks like the film has been speeded up!\". Sam was estimated 10 seconds up when he hit the final left hand turn at the bottom of the track. He pulled one of his classic drift turns around the corner but as he straightened up on exit his bike suddenly washed out from under him. He got straight back on his bike but it had cost him his lead and he finished 0.5 of a second behind eventual second place Steve Peat.2008 World Championships, 3rd Place, Sam Hill"]}, {"page": "Ecclesfield School", "response": ["* Steve Peat, mountain biker"]}, {"page": "Josh Bryceland", "response": ["He entered his first race at 10 .
