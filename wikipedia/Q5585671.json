It was a situation comedy in which he played a character with his own name. The series was cancelled after one season.\nAs a child, Peters sang in the choir of Durham Cathedral. He later enrolled at Durham Commercial College to learn bookkeeping. He worked as a junior clerk before volunteering for the Royal Navy.\nPeters has had many roles in other television shows over the years, including Oh Brother!, two episodes of Hi-de-Hi!, four episodes of Dad's Army, two episodes of Are You Being Served?, one episode of Grace & Favour (also called Are You Being Served? Again! in the United States). He played Victor and Margaret Meldrews' family friend Ronnie in three episodes of the long-running BBC sitcom One Foot in the Grave during the 1990s, five episodes of Never the Twain. Moreover he featured in one episode of Little Britain, as a booking clerk in an episode of the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances and in one episode of HBO's Tales from the Crypt.\nHe voiced some of the Mr. Men in the 1995\u201397 series of Mr. Men and Little Miss.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "One Foot in the Grave", "response": ["Ronnie and Mildred (Gordon Peters and Barbara Ashcroft) \u2013 Ronnie and Mildred were a constantly cheerful, but incredibly boring, couple who provided yet another annoyance to the Meldrews, who dreaded any upcoming visits to them; Victor once said that he had hoped they were both dead. In \"The Worst Horror of All\", when the couple attempted a surprise visit, the Meldrews hid in their house to give the impression they were away on holiday and then took the phone off the hook for several days afterwards, though these efforts to avoid them were in vain. They are referenced a number of times in the series for giving the Meldrews bizarre and always unwanted presents that are seldom opened, usually involving a garish photograph of themselves. In the final series, however it was clear that their cheerfulness was a fa\u00e7ade and, in a particularly dark scene, Mildred hanged herself \"during a game of Happy Families\". The shot of Mildred's feet dangling outside the window is usually cut from pre-watershed screenings."]}, {"page": "2002 in film", "response": ["| FeardotCom || Warner Bros.
