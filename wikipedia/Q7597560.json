This distinct company (known as \"New Jam Inc\") effectively became the independent Element 14 venture, acquiring the name from the former Acorn Computers Limited which then became known as Cabot 2 Limited. A subsequent report put the sale price of this division of Acorn at \u00a31.5\u00a0million, offering the prescient observation that this new business would itself be acquired for \"several million pounds\" by an established company in the industry, as it indeed was."]}, {"page": "Phoebe (computer)", "response": ["Acorn Computers' CEO Stan Boland said, \"There is not a big enough market for the PC (Risc PC 2), which is largely for home use and games. It's an enthusiast's product. We are going to resize the rest of the company and concentrate on becoming a digital TV and thin client company\".

In July 2004, Icera completed another $32.5M Series B funding round and, later that year, licensed TTPCom's 2G/3G protocol stack. In January 2005, the Sophia Antipolis offices in France were opened. In September 2005, Icera's first 90\u00a0nm Livanto ICE8020 chips were sampled to Seiko Instruments Inc, for a first product development for Vodafone KK. In March 2006, the company completed its third financing round raising $60M Series C funds. Icera launched its Espresso 200 platform in 2006, and two new offices were opened in Austin, Texas, and in Cambridge, United Kingdom."]}]}}
