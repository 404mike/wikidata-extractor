According to one biographer his love for his mother \"was the most powerful emotion of his entire life ... the whole of his psychological history was dominated by it\". Walpole did not have any serious relationships with women; he has been called \"a natural celibate\". His sexual orientation has been the subject of speculation. He never married, engaging in a succession of unconsummated flirtations with unmarriageable women, and counted among his close friends a number of women such as Anne Seymour Damer and Mary Berry named by a number of sources as lesbian. Many contemporaries described him as effeminate (one political opponent called him \"a hermaphrodite horse\"). Biographers such as Timothy Mowl explore his possible homosexuality, including a passionate but ultimately unhappy love affair with the 9th Earl of Lincoln. Some previous biographers such as Lewis, Fothergill, and Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, however, have interpreted Walpole as asexual."]}, {"page": "Astley Hall, Chorley", "response": ["* Timothy Mowl & Brian Earnshaw Architecture without kings, 1995, p.\u00a0174"]}, {"page": "John Betjeman", "response": ["Betjeman left Oxford without a degree.
