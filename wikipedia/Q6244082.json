In 1961, he moved to Umist, now part of Manchester University, to take up a lectureship and founded the Atmospheric Physics research group. In 1988, he was hired as a senior research associate in ESSL/MMM at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Colorado.Latham is most known for his work on thunderstorm electrification and marine cloud brightening, a form of geoengineering which relies on seawater sprayed from ships. In collaboration with Stephen Salter he developed a scheme involving Flettner vessels.\nHe supervised over 25 doctoral students, the first of whom was David Stow.Latham was also a talented writer. He published six collections of poetry and had radio plays broadcast on BBC Radio 4.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Latham", "response": ["John Latham may refer to:", "* John Latham (ornithologist) (1740\u20131837), British physician, naturalist and author", "* John Latham (1761\u20131843), English physician, President of the Royal College of Physicians", "* John Latham (1787\u20131853), his son, English magistrate  and poet", "* John Latham (judge) (1877\u20131964), Australian judge and politician", "* John Latham (artist) (1921\u20132006), conceptual artist born in Zambia", "* John Latham (Whitewater), U.S. bank executive involved in Whitewater controversy, 1990s", "* John Latham (physicist) (1937\u20132021), British physicist"]}, {"page": "John Mason (meteorologist)", "response": ["From 1965 to 1983 he was Director of the UK Meteorological Office at Bracknell where he also developed theories to explain how electric charge is separated in thunderclouds, ultimately leading to lightning.

Their goal was to make clouds more reflective to bounce more of the Sun's heat generating rays back into space as a stop-gap against global warming. By changing the size of water droplets within a cloud, they make clouds brighter and reflect the Sun's heat into space. They choose to seed marine stratocumulus clouds because of their commonality around the world and the fact that they are low-lying, making it easier for man-made droplets to reach them. The Project Earth team uses the potassium chloride and sodium chloride from (salt-based) flares to form droplet particles that are one micrometre in diameter, and that can rise to , even in adverse (cloudless) conditions. The experiment proves that man-made droplets can indeed seed stratocumulus clouds."]}, {"page": "Solar geoengineering", "response": ["Various cloud reflectivity methods have been suggested, such as that proposed by John Latham and Stephen Salter, which works by spraying seawater in the atmosphere to increase the reflectivity of clouds. The extra condensation nuclei created by the spray would change the size distribution of the drops in existing clouds to make them whiter. The sprayers would use fleets of unmanned rotor ships known as Flettner vessels to spray mist created from seawater into the air to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from the Earth. The whitening effect is created by using very small cloud condensation nuclei, which whiten the clouds due to the Twomey effect."]}, {"page": "Marine cloud brightening", "response": ["Marine cloud brightening was originally suggested by John Latham in 1990.", "In the earliest published studies, John Latham and Stephen Salter proposed a fleet of around 1500 unmanned Rotor ships, or Flettner ships, that would spray mist created from seawater into the air.  The vessels would spray sea water droplets at a rate of approximately 50 cubic meters per second over a large portion of Earth's ocean surface. The power for the rotors and the ship could be generated from underwater turbines. Salter and colleagues proposed using active hydro foils with controlled pitch for power.[1]"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2021", "response": ["*John Latham, 83, British climate physicist.John Latham obituary"]}]}}
