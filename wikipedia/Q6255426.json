Rogers' batting style is unknown, though it is known he fielded as a wicket-keeper.\nRogers was born at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, the first child of farmer Robert Rogers and Hannah Pritchard.  He was educated at All Saints Grammar School in Bloxham.Rogers made a single first-class appearance for Middlesex against Surrey at The Oval in 1891.  Middlesex made 86 in their first-innings, with Rogers ending the innings not out on 7, while in response, Surrey made 233 in their first-innings.  In their second-innings, Middlesex made 144, with Rogers being dismissed for a duck by George Lohmann.  In a season in which Middlesex experimented with a number of wicket-keepers, this match proved to be his only major appearance for the county.\nHe married Annie Wall in 1888 in Greenwich. In 1891, he was working as a school principal in London, at the Finchley House School for English and French Pupils. Prior to that, he was Head Mathematical Master of the Grange School in Eastbourne and First Master of London International College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rogers", "response": ["John Rogers may refer to:", "* John Rogers (died 1565) (before 1507\u20131565), English MP for Dorset, 1545\u20131559", "* John Rogers II (died 1611/12), MP for Canterbury", "* John Rogers (1750\u20131832), British MP for West Looe, Penryn and Helston", "* Sir John Rogers, 1st Baronet (1649\u20131710), English MP for Plymouth 1698\u20131700", "* Sir John Rogers, 2nd Baronet (1676\u20131744), British MP for Plymouth 1713\u20131722", "* Sir John Rogers, 3rd Baronet (1708\u20131773), British MP for Plymouth 1739\u20131740", "* Sir John Rogers, 6th Baronet (1780\u20131847), British MP for Callington", "* John Rogers (Continental Congress) (1723\u20131789), delegate to Continental Congress", "* John Rogers (New York politician) (1813\u20131879), US Congressman from New York", "* John Rogers (Alabama politician) (born 1940), Alabama State Representative", "* John Rogers (Ohio politician), Ohio state representative", "* John Rogers (Cherokee chief), last elected Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation West", "* John Rogers (Australian politician) (1842\u20131908)", "* John Rogers (Irish lawyer) (born 1947), Attorney General of Ireland, 1984\u20131987", "* John Rogers (Bible editor and martyr) (c. 1500\u20131555), editor and translator of the Matthew Bible", "* John Rogers (died 1636), Puritan lecturer of Dedham, Essex", "* John Rogers (Fifth Monarchist) (1627\u2013?), minister and physician", "* John Rogers (priest) (1679\u20131729), English controversialist", "* John Rogers (divine) (1778\u20131856), clergyman and writer", "* John Rogers (Dean of Llandaff) (born 1934), Dean of Llandaff Cathedral in Wales", "* John Rogers (Archdeacon of Leicester) (1648\u20131715), Anglican priest in England", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1858) (1858\u20131935), Australian cricketer for Victoria", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1860) (1860\u2013?), English cricketer for Middlesex", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1910) (1910\u20131968), English first-class cricketer", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1943), Australian cricketer for New South Wales, see Chris Rogers", "* John Rogers (cricketer, born 1987), Australian cricketer for Tasmania, Western Australia", "* John Rogers (rugby union) (1867\u20131922), England international rugby union player", "* John Rogers (baseball) (1844\u20131910), owner of the Philadelphia Phillies", "* John Rogers, Irish footballer for Shelbourne FC, brother of Eamonn Rogers", "* John Rogers (footballer) (born 1950), English footballer", "* John Rogers (ice hockey) (born 1953), Canadian ice hockey player", "* John Rogers (ice hockey, born 1910) (1910\u2013?), British ice hockey player", "* John Rogers (rower) (1930\u20132016), Australian Olympic rower", "* John Rogers (American football center) (1910\u20131968), American football player", "* John Rogers (Harvard) (1630\u20131684), president of Harvard University", "* John Rogers (sculptor) (1829\u20131904), sculptor from Salem, Massachusetts", "* John Rogers (naturalist) (1807\u20131867), English barrister and gardener", "* John Rogers (RAF officer) (1928\u20132021), British air marshal", "* John Rogers (writer), screenwriter, comics writer, film producer", "* John Rogers (businessman) (?\u20132018), Canadian-born American businessman and executive", "* John Rogers (academic) (1651\u20131703), English academic", "* John Rogers (Albemarle County, Virginia) (died 1838), overseer of three plantations"]}]}}
