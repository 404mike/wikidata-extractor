Field resigned following differences with the Prime Minister, and as a backbencher soon became one of the Labour government's most vocal critics.\nField was elected Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee in June 2015, and following the 2017 general election was re-elected unopposed.In August 2018, Field resigned the Labour whip citing anti-semitism in the party, and a \"culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation\" in parts of the party, including in his own constituency. Field lost a confidence vote in his constituency party a month before his resignation, after siding with the government in Brexit votes.
