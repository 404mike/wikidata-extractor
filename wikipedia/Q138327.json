Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that \"Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze.\" Later that year, she played a housewife dying of cancer in One True Thing. The film met with positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle declared, \"After One True Thing, critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural \u2013 so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration \u2013 that she's able to give us a woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable.\" Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan noted that her role \"is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career,\" but she \"adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [her performance] one of her most moving.\""]}, {"page": "28 Days Later", "response": ["A sequel, 28 Weeks Later, was released on 11 May 2007.
