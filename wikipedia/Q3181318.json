Dallas played international rugby for Scotland but is more notable as a rugby referee, and controversially officiated the 1905 encounter between Wales and New Zealand, a match seen as one of the greatest games in the history of the rugby union. He became the 39th President of the Scottish Rugby Union.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Watsonian FC", "response": ["* John Dallas"]}, {"page": "Dave Gallaher", "response": ["The match was preceded by an All Black haka, to which the crowd responded with the Welsh national song \"Land of my Fathers\". Wales had developed tactics to negate the seven-man New Zealand scrum, and removed a man from their scrum to play as a \"rover\", equivalent to Gallaher's wing-forward position. Gallaher was consistently penalised by the Scottish referee, John Dallas, who held that the New Zealander was feeding the ball into the scrum incorrectly. This eventually compelled Gallaher to instruct his team not to contest the scrums, and therefore give Wales possession following each scrum. Bob Deans, playing at wing for New Zealand that day, later said that Dallas had gone \"out to penalise Gallaherthere is no doubt about that\". Teddy Morgan scored an unconverted try for Wales shortly before half-time to give the home side a 3\u20130 lead."]}, {"page": "List of Beano comic strips", "response": ["| John Dallas, Dave Eastbury, Alexander Matthews", "| John Dallas", "| John Dallas"]}, {"page": "Dallas (name)", "response": ["* John Dallas (1878\u20131942), Scottish rugby union player and referee"]}, {"page": "John Dallas (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Dallas"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|256||DallasJohn Dallas||style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccffcc;\"|forward||1903-03-21||v England at Richmond"]}, {"page": "John Dallas (rugby union)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Dallas"]}, {"page": "Match of the Century (rugby union)", "response": ["There are conflicting reports on whether the referee, John Dallas was late to the incident.
