After one season at Millwall, he made a \u00a31 million transfer to Crystal Palace of the Premier League in 1992. In March 1995, he became the first Premier League player to receive a doping ban, testing positive for cannabis. He joined Tottenham Hotspur that June for a club record \u00a34.5 million and was part of their team that won the League Cup in 1999. After a one-game spell at Bolton Wanderers, he returned to Wrexham for the remainder of his career.\nArmstrong was tracked by the international teams of Wales, Nigeria and the Republic of Ireland but rejected all three.

His best form came in the FA Cup, in which he scored five goals in Tottenham's run to the semi-final. This included a hat-trick in a 6\u20132 fifth round replay win at Southampton.
