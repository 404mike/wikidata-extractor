After studying with Rudolf Laban he developed Movement Pattern Analysis - a system for analysing and interpreting movement behaviour, which has been applied in numerous fields including management consulting, executive recruitment and therapy.  Lamb used the MPA system in advising multinational corporations, typically at top team level, and also government organizations.  Lamb differentiated his system from the popular body language literature and argued that the key to interpreting behaviour was not fixed gestures but the dynamics of movement.  Lamb's underlying theory was that each individual has a unique way of moving which is constant and that these distinct movement patterns reflect (and predict) the individual's way of thinking and behaving.  In MPA he developed a system for identifying these patterns and relating them to behaviours, with the aim of predicting how people will behave in various situations based on their movement patterns.  Recent studies led by Harvard University and Brown University in the United States reported significant predictive reliability for the system.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rudolf von Laban", "response": ["Among Laban's students, friends, and associates were Mary Wigman, Kurt Jooss, Lisa Ullmann, Albrecht Knust, Lilian Harmel, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Hilde Holger, Gertrud Kraus, Gisa Geert, Warren Lamb, Elizabeth Sneddon, Dilys Price, Yat Malmgren, Sylvia Bodmer, and Irmgard Bartenieff."]}, {"page": "Laban movement analysis", "response": ["Laban movement analysis (LMA), sometimes Laban/Bartenieff movement analysis, is a method and language for describing, visualizing, interpreting and documenting human movement.

While isolated gestures and certain postures might have some social or cultural significance in a specific context, PGM\u02bcs have the potential to transcend cultural and social specificity, revealing a person's underlying motivations in decision-making. Lamb also identified, among other things, the correlation between styles of interaction (in behaviour) and the relationship between \"effort\" and \"shape\" (in movement).See Lamb (2012)."]}, {"page": "Irmgard Bartenieff", "response": ["While maintaining an active practice in physical therapy, Bartenieff resumed study with Laban and his colleagues in England in the 1950s.
