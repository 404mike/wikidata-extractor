One of the foremost teachers of his age, and the first Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Cambridge, he played a great part in the revival of Greek learning in England. He was tutor to Prince Edward, the future King Edward VI, and also sometimes to Princess Elizabeth. Of strongly Reformist sympathy in religious affairs, his public career as provost of King's College, Cambridge, Member of Parliament and briefly as Secretary of State during King Edward's reign was brought to a close by the accession of Queen Mary in 1553. He went into voluntary exile abroad, at first under royal licence (which he overstayed). He was captured and imprisoned in 1556, and under threat or apprehension of execution by the fire made a forced public recantation and affiliated himself to the Church of Rome. He died not long afterwards, filled with remorse for having forsworn his true belief from the infirmity of fear. His character, teaching and reputation were, however, admiringly and honourably upheld.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward VI", "response": ["From the age of six, Edward began his formal education under Richard Cox and John Cheke, concentrating, as he recalled himself, on \"learning of tongues, of the scripture, of philosophy, and all liberal sciences\".;  For example, he read biblical texts, Cato, Aesop's Fables and Vives's Satellitium Vivis, which were written for his sister, Mary. He received tuition from his sister Elizabeth's tutor, Roger Ascham, and from Jean Belmain, learning French, Spanish and Italian. In addition, he is known to have studied geometry and learned to play musical instruments, including the lute and the virginals. He collected globes and maps and, according to coinage historian C. E. Challis, developed a grasp of monetary affairs that indicated a high intelligence. Edward's religious education is assumed to have favoured the reforming agenda.;  His religious establishment was probably chosen by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, a leading reformer. Both Cox and Cheke were \"reformed\" Catholics or Erasmians and later became Marian exiles. By 1549, Edward had written a treatise on the pope as Antichrist and was making informed notes on theological controversies.;  Many aspects of Edward's religion were essentially Catholic in his early years, including celebration of the mass and reverence for images and relics of the saints.", "Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, but by the end of the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was \"much amended\", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, sitting at his window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that \"the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood\". Now his doctors believed he was suffering from \"a suppurating tumour\" of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery.;  Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor John Cheke he whispered, \"I am glad to die\"."]}, {"page": "June 16", "response": ["*1514 \u2013 John Cheke, English academic and politician, English Secretary of State (d. 1557)"]}, {"page": "September 13", "response": ["*1557 \u2013 John Cheke, English scholar and politician, Secretary of State for England (b. 1514)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Cranmer", "response": ["The origins of the statement which eventually became the Forty-Two Articles are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding that his bishops should subscribe to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of a statement to the bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort to developing the articles, most likely owing to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two Articles were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed during the time of the Convocation (hence evading giving a direct answer). The council gave Cranmer the unhappy task of requiring the bishops to subscribe to the articles, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded which were to render the subscriptions futile."]}, {"page": "1557", "response": ["* September 13 \u2013 John Cheke, English classical scholar and statesman (b. 1514)"]}, {"page": "1514", "response": ["* June 16 \u2013 John Cheke, English classical scholar and statesman (d. 1557)"]}, {"page": "Hans Holbein the Younger", "response": ["No certain portraits survive of Anne Boleyn by Holbein, perhaps because her memory was purged following her execution for treason, incest, and adultery in 1536.Parker, 53\u201354; Wilson, 209\u201310; Ives, 43. A drawing at Windsor inscribed \"Anna Bollein Queen\" has been discounted as incorrectly labelled by K. T. Parker and other scholars, citing heraldic sketches on the reverse. Anne's biographer Eric Ives believes that there is \"little to reinstate\" that drawing or another at the British Museum inscribed \"Anne Bullen Regina Angli\u00e6 \u2026 decollata fuit Londini 19 May 1536\", though he speculates that a 17th-century copy by John Hoskins \"from an ancient original\" may be based on a lost Holbein portrait of Anne. Derek Wilson, however, follows the recent scholarship of Starkey/Rowlands in arguing that the Windsor drawing is of Anne. He doubts that John Cheke was mistaken, who made the attribution in 1542, since Cheke knew many who had seen Anne. It is clear, however, that Holbein worked directly for Anne and her circle.Rowlands, 88, 91. He designed a cup engraved with her device of a falcon standing on roses, as well as jewellery and books connected to her. He also sketched several women attached to her entourage, including her sister-in-law Jane Parker.Wilson, 208\u2013209. At the same time, Holbein worked for Thomas Cromwell as he masterminded Henry VIII's reformation. Cromwell commissioned Holbein to produce reformist and royalist images, including anti-clerical woodcuts and the title page to Myles Coverdale's English translation of the Bible.

He also acquired the affections of Cheke's sister, Mary, and was in 1541 removed by his father to Gray's Inn, without having taken a degree, as was common at the time for those not intending to enter the Church. The precaution proved useless and four months later Cecil committed one of the rare rash acts of his life in marrying Mary Cheke. The only child of this marriage, Thomas, the future Earl of Exeter, was born in May 1542, and in February 1543 Cecil's first wife died. Three years later, on 21 December 1546 he married Mildred Cooke, who was ranked by Ascham with Lady Jane Grey as one of the two most learned ladies in the kingdom, (aside from another of Ascham's pupils, Elizabeth Tudor, who was later Elizabeth I)  and whose sister, Anne, was the wife of Sir Nicholas Bacon, and later the mother of Sir Francis Bacon.", "Years afterwards, he pretended that he had only signed the devise as a witness, but in his apology to Queen Mary I, he did not venture to allege so flimsy an excuse; he preferred to lay stress on the extent to which he succeeded in shifting the responsibility on to the shoulders of his brother-in-law, Sir John Cheke, and other friends, and on his intrigues to frustrate the Queen to whom he had sworn allegiance.P.

In it he urged Edward VI to take control of the English Reformation, and proposed that Parliament introduce fourteen laws of reform, covering both ecclesiastical and civil matters.  In his view the Reformation was not only concerned with the church, but in all areas of life. Noting the difficult social conditions in England, he promoted the role of deacons to care for the poor and needy.  He described marriage as a social contract rather than a sacrament, hence he permitted divorce, a modern idea that was considered too advanced for its time.  He advocated the restructuring of economic and administrative systems with suggestions for improving industry, agriculture, and education.

In 1576, Richard Farrant, then Master of Windsor Chapel leased part of the former buttery from More in order to stage plays. As often in the theatrical practice of the time, this commercial enterprise was justified by the convenient fiction of royal necessity; Farrant claimed to need the space for his child choristers to practice plays for the Queen, but he also staged plays for paying audiences.

However, at the end of the year he conspired (as part of \"Wyatt's Rebellion\") against her proposed marriage to Crown Prince Philip II of Spain: unlike many of his co-conspirators, he managed to escape arrest, and fled into exile on the European mainland in January 1554.Wagner 1998, pp. 154-95. In May 1556 he was arrested with Sir John Cheke in Flanders and returned unceremoniously to England in a fishing boat.

Sir Henry was appointed to the Lieutenancy of the Tower on 28 October 1555, after the resignation of Thomas Brydges. Among his prisoners were Sir Peter Carew, Sir Nicholas Arnold, Sir William Courtenay and Sir John Bray. Many unpleasant episodes passed in the Tower of London during Bedingfield's governance of it, not least the tortures and executions arising from the Henry Dudley conspiracy in 1556, and the enforced recantation of Sir John Cheke a few days after the death of Edward Lewknor. Yet several prisoners under his charge were permitted to have access to their wives or family members, and in such matters Sir Henry appears to have been the obedient interpreter of Mary's direct commands, rather than the initiator of autocratic or vindictive practises.The manuscripts of Sir Henry Bedingfield at Oxburgh Hall are calendared by A.J.

Thomas Cranmer took the couple into his palace at Lambeth and soon afterward appointed Enzinas to teach Greek at Cambridge. His status at the University is uncertain; there is no evidence that he held a professorship, and more likely was paid by Cranmer to cover an extended absence of Regius Professor of Greek John Cheke."]}, {"page": "Privy chamber", "response": ["During 1549\u201353, there were six \"principal gentlemen\" (Sir John Cheke, Sir Henry Sydney, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, Sir Thomas Wroth, Sir Henry Nevill and Barnaby) and twenty-six \"ordinary gentlemen\" in Edward VI's Privy chamber. All of these gentlemen, except for Barnaby, were 10 to 15 years older than the king.Clements R. Markham, King Edward VI: An Appreciation, p. 168 online Usually, the six \"principal gentlemen\" would be close intimates of the monarch; however, with a king as young and inexperienced as Edward, there was a huge possibility that some of these men could have forced themselves onto the king rather than the other way around. In fact, it might well have been the case that there were gentlemen of the privy chamber who were not so friendly with the king: such may have been Sir Phillip Hoby, who was a diplomatist and an intriguer, or Lord Strange and William Stanley who \"confessed to having been employed by Somerset as a spy\"."]}]}}
