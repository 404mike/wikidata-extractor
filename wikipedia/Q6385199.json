However, he failed to respond to the club's contract offer and on August 12, 2002, Feuer signed a week by week contract with Tranmere Rovers when their starting keeper, Keith Welch, was injured. He remained there for two weeks, playing in league matches against Colchester United and Cheltenham Town, before being asked to go on a trial with Arsenal. He spent six weeks at the North London based club but a move was cancelled by his former agent who Feuer described as \"dissatisfied\". Feuer instead went on a trial with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He joined the club on a non-contract basis as cover for the injured Michael Oakes during September 2002 where he featured as an unused substitute in two league games. Less than a week later, Crystal Palace attempted to sign Feuer when Matt Clarke was injured. However, they could not come to terms with Feuer and pulled out of the deal. Feuer then retired from playing professionally and returned to the U.S. to start a coaching career. He was appointed goalkeeper coach for LA Galaxy in 2007, remaining in the role until 2013 when he was replaced by Matt Reis."]}]}}
