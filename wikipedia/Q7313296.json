His liberal tendencies led to conflict with traditionalist clergy in general and the supporters of Tractarianism during the years he taught in Oxford (1829\u20131846) which coincided with a period of rapid social change and heightened political tensions.  His support for the campaign for the admission of non-Anglicans to Oxford and Cambridge Universities was unpopular at the time (1834) and led to serious protests when he was nominated to the Regius Professorship of Divinity two years later. His election as Bishop of Hereford became a cause celebre in Victorian religious controversies because it raised questions about the royal prerogative in the appointment of bishops and the role of the prime minister.  He administered the diocese with tolerance and charity without being involved in any further controversy for nearly twenty years.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Regius Professor of Divinity", "response": ["* Renn Dickson Hampden, DD, Principal of St Mary Hall; afterwards Bishop of Hereford (1836)"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Hereford", "response": ["*92.
