He once joked that due to the amount of time spent in underground air-raid shelters people in London were becoming troglodytes, and he took up this word for one of his early jazz bands, Wally Fawkes and the Troglodytes. After the group disbanded Fawkes adopted \"Trog\" as his pen-name. In 1947, he took a weekly course at the Camberwell School of Art in London where fellow students included Humphrey Lyttelton and Francis Wilford-Smith.  Fawkes had been a member of George Webb's Dixielanders, a semi-professional revivalist jazz band that featured Lyttelton on trumpet, since 1944. When Lyttelton left the Dixielanders in January 1948 to form his own jazz band, Fawkes went with him and stayed with the band until 1956, by which time it had evolved from revivalism to mainstream jazz. This suited Fawkes, as his own bands from then on could be broadly described as mainstream.  He re-united with Lyttelton periodically thereafter, and, though highly talented on his instrument, remains (in the best sense of the term) an \"amateur\". He has long admired Sidney Bechet and once recorded with him, as part of Lyttelton's band, in 1949.  He played with George Melly and John Chilton in the Feetwarmers band in the early 1970s."]}, {"page": "Francis Smith", "response": ["*Francis Wilford-Smith (1927\u20132009), British cartoonist, graphic artist, and producer and archivist of blues music"]}, {"page": "Warwick School", "response": ["* Francis Wilford-Smith: cartoonist, graphic artist, and producer and archivist of blues music"]}, {"page": "1927 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 12 March \u2013 Francis Wilford-Smith, cartoonist (died 2009)"]}, {"page": "2009 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Francis Wilford-Smith, cartoonist (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2009", "response": ["*Francis Wilford-Smith, 82, British cartoonist."]}, {"page": "Smilby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Wilford-Smith"]}, {"page": "Francis Wilford Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Wilford-Smith"]}, {"page": "Old Warwickians", "response": ["* Francis Wilford-Smith (British cartoonist, graphic artist, and producer and archivist of blues music)"]}]}}
