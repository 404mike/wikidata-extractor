The move to Freeview saw Dave launch in the bandwidth previously used by UKTV History which was moved to the time limited (7.00\u00a0am to 6.00\u00a0pm) bandwidth once occupied by UKTV Bright Ideas. Dave is available daily, from 7.00\u00a0am to 4.00\u00a0am, on all platforms. It uses the tagline \"the home of witty banter\" and uses Ralph Ineson as an announcer, along with David Flynn, Phill Jupitus, Iain Lee and BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James."]}, {"page": "Casualty (TV series)", "response": ["Holby City began on 12 January 1999 as a spin-off from Casualty and is named after the fictional Holby City Hospital in which both series are set. The show follows the lives and careers of staff and patients on the surgical wards of the hospital, and deals with a range of clinical and ethical issues. Similarly to Casualty, the regular characters are all surgeons, nurses and other medical and ancillary staff, with patients played by guest actors, including famous names such as Eric Sykes, Phill Jupitus, Michael Jayston, Michele Dotrice, Ronni Ancona, Emma Samms, Lee Ryan, Nikki Sanderson and Johnny Briggs. The show was created by Mal Young and Tony McHale, who became its executive producer between 2007 and 2010. He was succeeded by Casualty executive producer Belinda Campbell."]}]}}
