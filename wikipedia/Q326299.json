He wrote Tommy Steele's \"Rock with the Caveman\" and was the sole creator of the musical Oliver! (1960). With Oliver! and his work alongside theatre director Joan Littlewood at Theatre Royal, Stratford East, he played an instrumental role in the 1960s birth of the British musical theatre scene after an era when American musicals had dominated the West End.Best known for creating the book, music and lyrics for Oliver!, Bart was described by Andrew Lloyd Webber as \"the father of the modern British musical\". In 1963 he won the Tony Award for Best Original Score for Oliver!, and the 1968 film version of the musical won a total of 6 Academy Awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture.Some of his other compositions include the theme song to the James Bond film From Russia with Love, and the songs \"Living Doll\" by Cliff Richard, \"Far Away\" by Shirley Bassey, \"Do You Mind?\" (recorded by both Anthony Newley and Andy Williams), \"Big Time\" (a 1961 cover by Jack Jones of his show tune from Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be), \"Easy Going Me\" by Adam Faith, \"Always You And Me\" by Russ Conway, and several songs recorded by Tommy Steele (\"A Handful of Songs\", \"Butterfingers\" and \"Little White Bull\"). By the mid 1960s he was as well known for his outlandish lifestyle, his celebrity friends, his excesses and his parties, as he was for his work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 1", "response": ["*1930 \u2013 Lionel Bart, English composer (d. 1999)"]}, {"page": "April 3", "response": ["*1999 \u2013 Lionel Bart, English composer (b. 1930)"]}, {"page": "Sid James", "response": ["In 1968, British Path\u00e9, (film reference 457.1), James, Val Doonican, and Arthur Askey, were filmed playing golf in Cockington, for their production, 'Viva Torbay: Travelling to the British Seaside'.

In the case of musicals, the music, the lyrics and the \"book\" (i.e., the spoken dialogue and the stage directions) may each have its own author. Thus, a musical such as Fiddler on the Roof has a composer (Jerry Bock), a lyricist (Sheldon Harnick) and the writer of the \"book\" (Joseph Stein). In rare cases, the composer writes everything except the dance arrangements \u2013 music, lyrics and libretto, as Lionel Bart did for Oliver!.", "The libretto of a musical, on the other hand, is almost always written in prose (except for the song lyrics). The libretto of a musical, if the musical is adapted from a play (or even a novel), may even borrow their source's original dialogue liberally \u2013 much as Oklahoma! used dialogue from Lynn Riggs's Green Grow the Lilacs, Carousel used dialogue from Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's Liliom, My Fair Lady took most of its dialogue word-for-word from George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, Man of La Mancha was adapted from the 1959 television play I, Don Quixote, which supplied most of the dialogue, and the 1954 musical version of Peter Pan used J. M. Barrie's dialogue. Even the musical Show Boat, which is greatly different from the Edna Ferber novel from which it was adapted, uses some of Ferber's original dialogue, notably during the miscegenation scene. And Lionel Bart's Oliver! uses chunks of dialogue from Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist, although it bills itself as a \"free adaptation\" of the novel."]}, {"page": "Shirley Bassey", "response": ["In the early and mid-1960s, Bassey had numerous hits in the UK, and five albums in the top 15.

Like previous British rockers such as Tommy Steele and Marty Wilde, Richard adopted Elvis-like dress and hairstyle. In performance he struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera. His late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, \"High Class Baby\" and \"Livin' Lovin' Doll\", were followed by \"Mean Streak\", which carried a rocker's sense of speed and passion, and Lionel Bart's \"Living Doll\"."]}, {"page": "Andrew Lloyd Webber", "response": ["Although composed in 1965, The Likes of Us was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's Sydmonton Festival. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, The Likes of Us is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly Richard Rodgers, Frederick Loewe, and Lionel Bart. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly through-composed, and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.", "In April 2008, Lloyd Webber reprised his role as judge, this time in the BBC musical talent show I'd Do Anything. The show followed a similar format to its Maria and Joseph predecessors, this time involving a search for an actress to play the role of Nancy in a West End production of Lionel Bart's Oliver!, a musical based on the Charles Dickens\u2019 novel Oliver Twist. The show also featured a search for three young actors to play and share the title character's role, but the show's main focus was on the search for Nancy. The role was won by Jodie Prenger despite Lloyd Webber's stated preference for one of the other contestants; the winners of the Oliver role were Harry Stott, Gwion Wyn-Jones and Laurence Jeffcoate. Also in April 2008, Lloyd Webber was featured on the U.S. talent show American Idol, acting as a mentor when the 6 finalists had to select one of his songs to perform for the judges that week."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay", "response": ["| The musical by Lionel Bart"]}, {"page": "Acton, London", "response": ["* Playwright/Composer Lionel Bart lived the latter part of his life in an apartment on Churchfield Road."]}, {"page": "Golders Green Crematorium", "response": ["* Lionel Bart, composer of Oliver! and many other shows and songs"]}, {"page": "Stepney", "response": ["Musicians Monty Norman (composer of the James Bond theme) and Lionel Bart (known for creating the book, music and lyrics to the production Oliver!), were also born in Stepney, as was musician Wiley, widely considered to be the founding father of grime music."]}, {"page": "Sheet music", "response": ["Comprehending sheet music requires a special form of literacy: the ability to read music notation. An ability to read or write music is not a requirement to compose music. There have been a number of composers and songwriters who have been capable of producing music without the capacity themselves to read or write in musical notation, as long as an amanuensis of some sort is available to write down the melodies they think of. Examples include the blind 18th-century composer John Stanley and the 20th-century songwriters Lionel Bart, Irving Berlin and Paul McCartney. As well, in traditional music styles such as the blues and folk music, there are many prolific songwriters who could not read music, and instead played and sang music \"by ear\"."]}, {"page": "Graham Norton", "response": ["In 2006, Norton hosted the BBC One series How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria? in which Andrew Lloyd Webber tried to find a lead actress for his West End version of The Sound of Music.

Oliver! was one of eight UK musicals featured on Royal Mail stamps, issued in February 2011.", "The show was a lavish affair and moved from its original intimate melodramatic feel to a more cinematic and symphonic feel that would accommodate an audience familiar with the 1968 motion picture. This production featured brand new music and lyrics written by Lionel Bart, and also additional dialogue not featured in the original script, added by Bart and Sam Mendes. Other updated elements include the addition of a prologue, in which the audience is witness to Oliver's harrowing birth. The dialogue was homage to both the 1948 and 1968 film versions of the story which were in turn based on the original novel. New music arrangements and dance sequences were added to various songs, most notably \"Consider Yourself\" and \"Who Will Buy?\". Tempos for some of the musical numbers were altered (notably \"It's a Fine Life\", \"I'd Do Anything\" and \"You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two\"), while other incidental numbers were drastically rewritten, including the London Bridge chase sequence.
