The team went into the New Year in ninth position, with games in hand on the teams above them, and being unbeaten at home in the league.

He came to attention after being sent off in a pre-season friendly against Valencia in 2004, whilst still just sixteen. He was likened to former Elland Road heroes Alan Smith and David Batty. He made his competitive debut on 7 August 2004 against Derby County, and went on to score three goals in the 2004\u201305 season, Leeds' first in the Championship. Walton struggled to break into the first team during the 2005\u201306 season with his only appearances coming after injuries to Sean Gregan, Shaun Derry, Jonathan Douglas and Gylfi Einarsson."]}, {"page": "Matthew Kilgallon", "response": ["In his first season in the Championship with Leeds, he was mainly playing left-back with Paul Butler and Sean Gregan the main centre-back partnership.

However, Marques instead chose to move to Leeds United on a free transfer. He was signed by manager Kevin Blackwell, but Marques made only one appearance for Leeds in the 2005\u201306 season in the League Cup against Oldham Athletic, in which he was clearly very nervous and uncomfortable playing out of position at right-back. Marques did not feature again for Leeds that season, with Paul Butler, Sean Gregan, Matthew Kilgallon, Clarke Carlisle and Michael Duberry all ahead of him in the pecking order. Towards the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he joined Hull City on a short-term loan, though his loan was cut short due to injury. He then returned to Leeds. He represented Angola in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and was one of two Leeds players to take part in that tournament, Eddie Lewis being the other, for the United States."]}, {"page": "Andy Crosby", "response": ["Crosby signed with Alan Murray's Darlington in December 1993, which went on to end the 1993\u201394 campaign second-from-bottom of the Football League.

The \"Quakers\" improved under new manager Jim Platt, and Crosby played 55 games in the 1995\u201396 campaign as Darlington qualified for the play-offs after finishing in fifth-place; he played in a back five alongside centre-backs Sean Gregan and Matty Appleby, supported by wing-backs Mark Barnard and Simon Shaw.
