The home side took the lead with ten minutes remaining of the first-half, Stacy Long was fouled in the area and referee Brendan Malone pointed to the spot. John Mousinho stepped up to score the penalty, his seventh goal of the season. Bradford equalised with just twenty minutes remaining \u2013 the Stevenage defence failed to deal with a ball into the area, and Bradford midfielder Dave Syers was on hand to poke the ball into the net. Stevenage responded within five minutes, Mousinho fed Craig Reid down the left, who squared the ball to Darius Charles, who subsequently drilled the ball low past goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin to give Stevenage all three points. Stevenage drew their following game 2\u20132 at Stockport County. The away side took the lead ten minutes after half-time through Mark Roberts. However, two quick-fire Stockport goals within the space of three second-half minutes gave Stockport the lead. Lawrie Wilson popped up in injury-time to secure Stevenage a point. Another 2\u20132 draw followed, this time at home to Aldershot Town. Stevenage took the lead after ten minutes, Darius Charles scoring from John Mousinho's lofted free-kick. Aldershot equalised just before half-time, Alex Rodman lashing the ball home after Stevenage had failed to clear the ball. Rodman scored again just after the break, cutting in from the left channel and scoring from just outside the area. The home side restored parity for twenty minutes remaining; Mousinho's corner arrived to Luke Foster at the back post, who rifled his shot through a body of players to earn Stevenage a valuable point. Stevenage's eight game unbeaten run ended on 22 April 2011, following a 1\u20130 defeat to Southend United at Roots Hall. Stevenage were reduced to ten men in the first-half, after Peter Winn was dismissed for a challenge on Sean Clohessy. The visitors were awarded a second-half penalty after Southend defender Bilel Mohsni fouled Byron Harrison, but John Mousinho's subsequent penalty was saved. Barry Corr scored what proved to be the winner ten minutes from time. Stevenage recorded a win just three days later, beating play-off rivals Port Vale 1\u20130 at Broadhall Way thanks to a goal from Lawrie Wilson with twenty minutes remaining. The club fell to their second successive away defeat on 30 April, losing 2\u20130 at Northampton Town at Sixfields Stadium.
