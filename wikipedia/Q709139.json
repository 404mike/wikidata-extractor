Air transport, the government believed, was primarily a public service, like hospitals, the railways or the post office.

Burnett and Drakeford frequently clashed and when in early 1942 Burnett proposed sweeping organizational changes, including the abolition of the Australian Air Board, a breaking point was reached.  It had also been widely argued that Burnett's focus on the European theatre resulted in the RAAF lacking sufficient defensive strength and by 1942 the threat of invasion by Japan was growing. Burnett was replaced in May 1942 by an Australian, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who succeeded to the position despite Burnett's lobbying for his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, to take over.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp.116\u2013119"]}, {"page": "Frederick Scherger", "response": ["As well as the loss of civil and military infrastructure, twenty-three aircraft and ten ships, and the death of some 250\u00a0people, 278\u00a0RAAF personnel had deserted Darwin in an exodus that became known as the \"Adelaide River Stakes\".Grose, An Awkward Truth, pp. 225\u2013231 \"There was\", in Scherger's words, \"an awful panic and a lot of men simply went bush\".Lockwood, Australia Under Attack, p. 133 Praised for his \"great courage and energy\", he was one of the few senior Air Force officers in the region to emerge from Commissioner Charles Lowe's inquiry into the debacle with his long-term career prospects undamaged.
