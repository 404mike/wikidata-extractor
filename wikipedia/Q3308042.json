However many whites rejected the New Kenya Group and condemned the London agreement, because it moved away from racial quotas and toward independence. Following the agreement a new African party, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), with the slogan \"Uhuru,\" or \"Freedom,\" was formed under the leadership of Kikuyu leader James S. Gichuru and labour leader Tom Mboya. KANU was formed in May 1960 when the Kenya African Union (KAU) merged with the Kenya Independence Movement (KIM) and Nairobi People's Convention Party (NPCP).The Politics of The Independence of Kenya by Kyle Keith. Palgrave MacMillan 1999 p 93-111 Mboya was a major figure from 1951 until his death in 1969. He was praised as nonethnic or antitribal, and attacked as an instrument of Western capitalism. Mboya as General Secretary of the Kenya Federation of Labour and a leader in the Kenya African National Union before and after independence skilfully managed the tribal factor in Kenyan economic and political life to succeed as a Luo in a predominantly Kikuyu movement. A split in KANU produced the breakaway rival party, the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU), led by Ronald Ngala and Masinde Muliro. In the elections of February 1961, KANU won 19 of the 33 African seats while KADU won 11 (twenty seats were reserved by quota for Europeans, Asians and Arabs). Kenyatta was finally released in August and became president of KANU in October."]}, {"page": "List of Old Wellingtonians", "response": ["*Michael Blundell (1907\u20131993), politician and government minister in Kenya"]}, {"page": "List of white Africans of European ancestry", "response": ["*Michael Blundell, farmer, politician"]}, {"page": "Majimbo", "response": ["The original plan, as created by Wilfred Havelock, Michael Blundell, and R. S. Alexander, would have resulted in three self-governing regions (Rift Valley, Western and Coast) in Kenya, which would share governance of the country based upon the mandate of the regional governments. This way, the Kikuyu and Luo people would each receive their own majority-ethnic governments and would negotiate with each other and with the other region for the creation and execution of any law on the national level. This was assumed as reasonable because of the fear that tribalist politics between the Kikuyu and Luo under a Westminster system would have been damaging for the other ethnic minorities in Kenya, including the European settlers and Asian residents. It became a part of the party platform for Ronald Ngala's KADU, which competed in the first post-independence elections against Jomo Kenyatta's nationalist Kenya African National Union party. In the Lancaster House constitutional conferences, Ngala's KADU delegation managed to negotiate the adoption of a federal system of governance for Kenya, with 8 autonomous regions based on the country's provinces. However amendments to Kenya's constitution meant by 1970 Kenya had reverted to being a unitary state."]}, {"page": "Ministry of Agriculture (Kenya)", "response": ["*Michael Blundell (1955\u201359)", "*Michael Blundell (1961\u201362)"]}, {"page": "1956\u201357 Kenyan general election", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Rift Valley||Michael Blundell||Independent||align=right|792||align=right|64.97||Re-elected"]}, {"page": "1952 Kenyan general election", "response": ["|Rift Valley||Michael Blundell||colspan=2 align=center|Unopposed||Re-elected"]}, {"page": "1962 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Michael Blundell, , Minister for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Water Resources, Kenya."]}, {"page": "Canarina eminii", "response": ["* Collins Guide to the Wildflowers of East Africa by Sir Michael Blundell, 1987.
