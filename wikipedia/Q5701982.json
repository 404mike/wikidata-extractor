A 1981 review of her Viola Sonata called it a \"thoughtful, well constructed piece\" from a relatively obscure composer; a 1985 review noted its \"emotional intensity and use of dark tone colours\". Andrew Achenbach, in his review of a Helen Callus recording of several Clarke works, referred to Morpheus as \"striking\" and \"languorous\". Laurence Vittes noted that Clarke's \"Lullaby\" was \"exceedingly sweet and tender\". A 1987 review concluded that \"it seems astonishing that such splendidly written and deeply moving music should have lain in obscurity all these years\"."]}, {"page": "Primrose International Viola Competition", "response": ["| Jury: Helen Callus (Chairman), Barbara Hamilton, Michael Palumbo, Kathryn Steely, Dwight Pounds Honorable Mention:  Amalia Aubert,  Abigail Evans"]}, {"page": "Suite for Viola and Orchestra (Vaughan Williams)", "response": ["* Walton, Vaughan Williams, Howells & Bowen (Nos. 1\u20133) \u2013 Helen Callus (viola); Marc Taddei (conductor); New Zealand Symphony Orchestra; Asv CDDCA 1181 (2006)"]}, {"page": "American Viola Society", "response": ["* Helen Callus (2005\u20132008)"]}, {"page": "Morpheus (Rebecca Clarke)", "response": ["* A Portrait of the Viola \u2013 Helen Callus, viola; Robert McDonald, piano; ASV Living Era (2002)"]}, {"page": "Pamela Harrison (composer)", "response": ["* A Portrait of the Viola \u2013 Pamela Harrison: Sonata for viola and piano (1946) \u2013 Helen Callus (viola); Robert McDonald (piano); ASV Ltd.
