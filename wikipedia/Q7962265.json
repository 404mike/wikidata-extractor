Hampson was determined to continue playing, and joined Leeds City as a 'guest' player during the war.

He was appointed captain, played at centre half in the club's first Football League fixture, a 2\u20130 win away to Wrexham, and continued as a regular selection. He missed a few weeks with influenza in early 1922, and despite a rumour that he was about to leave the club, he was ever-present for the rest of the season. Hopkins played regularly for the first half of the 1922\u201323 season before losing his place to Walker Hampson, and he was listed for transfer at a fee of \u00a350. However, when another Third Division club, Durham City approached Hartlepools United, the directors agreed to let Hopkins leave on a free transfer. A pre-season profile suggested that the Durham club, whose financial situation meant their playing staff was about 80% amateur, were signing \"the right sort\" of professional player, which included the \"experienced and clever\" Hopkins. He missed only four league matches during the 1923\u201324 season, and scored three goals. He was appointed player-coach for 1924\u201325, and although he lost his place as first-team centre half to Joe Robson, he continued to contribute as coach and reserve-team player until the end of the season, at which point, at the age of nearly 37, he retired from playing."]}, {"page": "Walker (given name)", "response": ["*Walker Hampson (1889\u20131959), English footballer"]}]}}
