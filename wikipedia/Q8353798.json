Campbell Parkin doubled the lead with a close-range effort from a corner in the twentieth minute. It was Parkin's second final, as he had played in the losing Dunedin Technical side in the 2008 final. Nathan Strom reduced the deficit with a 34th-minute header, and Bay olympic continued to push for the rest of the half and the first few minutes of the second spell. With fifteen minutes remaining, it was Miramar who gained their third however, with a run by Michael White through the Bay defence. Olympic had a chance to reduce the deficit shortly afterwards when an ill-timed challenge on Joe Edwards by Schaeffers gave them a penalty. Goalkeeper Phil Imray kept out Strom's spot kick, and the score remained 3\u20131."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 OFC Champions League", "response": ["|align=left| Danny Robinson"]}, {"page": "2013 OFC Champions League Final", "response": ["| GK || 1 ||  Danny Robinson"]}, {"page": "Danny Robinson (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Danny Robinson"]}, {"page": "Fable Records", "response": ["Fable's success continued through 1971. Early in the year it scored another Top 20 hit with a version of Cat Stevens' \"Wild World\", credited to the studio group Fourth House. This song (which competed with the Jimmy Cliff version) had been intended as a solo release for Mike Brady (ex MPD Ltd), but an oversight during the recording of the backing track resulted in the song being pitched too high for Brady's vocal range, so Tudor called in former Wild Cherries lead singer Danny Robinson to overdub the lead vocal. A few weeks later The Mixtures' follow-up single \"The Pushbike Song\" became a major local and international hit\u2014it spent 12 weeks at #1 in Australia and also topped the charts in the UK, making it the first international hit to be entirely written, recorded and produced in Australia."]}]}}
