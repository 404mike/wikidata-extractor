She grew up in the State of Washington and attended the University of Washington. After college, Jewell briefly worked as an oil engineer before transitioning to the banking industry. A position on the board of Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI), a Seattle-based retailer of outdoor gear, in 1996, eventually led to her becoming the company's chief operating officer, from 2000 to 2005, and then chief executive officer from 2005 to 2013.\nJewell is a lifelong outdoors enthusiast and while at REI became known for her involvement in conservation and environmental protection. These efforts brought her to the attention of the Obama administration, and she was nominated as Secretary of the Interior to succeed Ken Salazar in 2013. Her nomination received substantial bipartisan support and she was handily confirmed by the Senate in April 2013. Jewell is the second woman to hold the position of Secretary of the Interior, after Gale Norton.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Washington", "response": ["Sally_Jewell_official_portrait.jpg|Sally Jewell, 51st United States Secretary of the Interior and former CEO of REI"]}, {"page": "United States Secretary of the Interior", "response": ["|Sally Jewell", "|Sally Jewell"]}, {"page": "King Cove, Alaska", "response": ["A partially completed road between King Cove and Cold Bay is awaiting approval through the USDOI.

Proponents of the road state it would help local citizens in need of medical evacuation when airplanes can not land or take off from the local airport due to darkness or weather conditions.

No evidence has been put forward to support a road would be safer in difficult weather condition than air transport.

The word Denali means \"the high one\" in the native Athabaskan language and refers to the mountain itself. The mountain was named after newly elected US president William McKinley in 1897 by local prospector William A. Dickey. The United States government formally adopted the name Mount McKinley after President Wilson signed the bill creating Mount McKinley National Park into effect in 1917.Sheldon, Charles (1931). A History of The Boone and Crockett Club. Boone and Crockett Club. pp. 54\u201359. In 1980, Mount McKinley National Park was combined with Denali National Monument, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act named the combined unit the Denali National Park and Preserve. At that time the Alaska state Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to Denali. However, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names did not recognize the change and continued to denote the official name as Mount McKinley. This situation lasted until Aug. 30, 2015, when President Barack Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell to rename the mountain to Denali, using statutory authority to act on requests when the Board of Geographic Names does not do so in a \"reasonable\" time period.McKinley no more: North America's tallest peak to be renamed Denali.
