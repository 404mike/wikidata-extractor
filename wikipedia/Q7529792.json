After boundary changes, he stood at the 1950 general election in the neighbouring Bradford North, where he unseated the Labour MP Muriel Nichol.\nTaylor served under Harold Macmillan as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Supply between 1957 and 1959, when the post was abolished, and as Under-Secretary of State for Air between 1959 and 1962. He held Bradford North until his defeat at 1964 general election by Labour's Ben Ford. He was created a Baronet, of Cawthorne in the West Riding of the County of York, in 1963. He died in July 1972, aged 69, when the baronetcy became extinct.", "link_mentions": {}}}
