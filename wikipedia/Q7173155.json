He described many new species; his collection, including type material,  is now in the Natural History Museum. He suffered from poor health and lack of employment. Latterly, he lived in New Mills and was supported by scholarships from the Royal Society.He loaned specimens to Jean-Jacques Kieffer, a teacher and Catholic priest in Bitche, Lorraine, who also named species after Cameron.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ichneumonidae", "response": ["*Peter Cameron"]}, {"page": "Timeline of entomology \u2013 1850\u20131900", "response": ["*Peter Cameron, A Monograph of the British Phytophagous Hymenoptera 1893 Ray Society commenced.

His interest deepened after Lord Walsingham and George Hampson published \"On Moths Collected at Aden and in Somaliland\" in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London in 1896. This article was based on Nurse's specimens and species new to science were described. Nurse later widened his interest to other orders of insects, especially Hymenoptera. At this time, Indian Hymenoptera were neglected. Nurse described many new species and added greatly to knowledge of the group. Many Nurse Hymenoptera specimens were described by Charles Thomas Bingham, Peter Cameron, and Claude Morley in The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma."]}, {"page": "Cotesia", "response": ["Cotesia is a genus of braconid wasps first described by Peter Cameron in 1891. Some species parasitize caterpillars of species considered pests, and are used as biocontrol agents. Cotesia congregata parasitizes the tomato and the tobacco hornworms. C. glomerata and C. rubecula feed on the cabbage white and other white butterfly caterpillars. C. gonopterygis and C. risilis are host-specific and parasitize the common brimstone.Lozan, Aurel; Spitzer, Karel; Jaro\u0161, Josef (2012-06-01). \"Isolated peat bog habitats and their food connections: parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea) and their lepidopteran hosts\".
