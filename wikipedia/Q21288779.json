Shortly after the war ended in 1945, Edgar Ainsworth, the art editor of Picture Post, commissioned Peake to visit France and Germany for the magazine. With writer Tom Pocock he was among the first British civilians to witness the horrors of the Nazi concentration camp at Belsen, where the remaining prisoners, too sick to be moved, were dying before his very eyes. He made several drawings, but not surprisingly he found the experience profoundly harrowing, and expressed in deeply felt poems the ambiguity of turning their suffering into art."]}, {"page": "Bergen-Belsen concentration camp", "response": ["* A number of British artists depicted the aftermath of the liberation of the camp.

Lorant, who was Jewish, had been imprisoned by Hitler in the early 1930s and later wrote a best-selling book, I Was Hitler's Prisoner. By 1940, he feared that he would be captured in a Nazi invasion of Britain and so fled to Massachusetts, where he wrote important illustrated US histories and biographies. During World War II, the art editor of the magazine, Edgar Ainsworth, served as a war correspondent and accompanied the American 7th Army on its advance across Europe in 1945. He visited the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp three times after the British army liberated the complex in April 1945. Several of his sketches and drawings from the camp were published in a September 1945 article, Victim and Prisoner. Ainsworth also commissioned the artist Mervyn Peake to visit France and Germany at the end of the war and reported from Bergen-Belsen."]}, {"page": "1945 in art", "response": ["* April 15 \u2013 Bergen-Belsen concentration camp liberated.

Zinkeisen was one of a small number of artists who produced pictures of Bergen-Belsen in the months following its liberation. The other artists there included Leslie Cole, Mary Kessell, Sergeant Eric Taylor (one of the camp's liberators), Edgar Ainsworth, and Mervyn Peake. Her painting Human Laundry shows German orderlies washing camp inmates before they go to hospital. Thomas Sutcliffe, columnist for The Independent described the painting as \"flatly representational\", \"as uninflected as a travel poster\", showing \"brutalisers obliged to become carers, victims turned to patients\". By the time Zinkeisen had become a war artist her palette had already darkened from the colours of her society paintings. Her war paintings use muted greys, browns, and ochres like contemporaries such as Eric Ravilious and Stanley Spencer."]}, {"page": "Ainsworth (surname)", "response": ["* Edgar Ainsworth (artist) (1905\u20131975), British artist"]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"A\"", "response": ["*Edgar Ainsworth (1905\u20131975), English painter and illustrator"]}, {"page": "Mary Kessell", "response": ["Kessell's first destination was the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, which had been liberated by Allied forces four months previously.

By the time Kessell arrived, the remaining camp buildings had been destroyed and former inmates were being transferred to the nearby displaced persons camp. Convoys for the camp survivors to return to their home countries were being organized and Kessell witnessed a number of these departures. This had a distinct effect on the work she produced. At Belsen, Kessell completed seven drawings in black and sanguine charcoal, which she called Notes from Belsen Camp, 1945. These were the smallest of the drawings produced during her time as a war artist. Unlike the work produced by the other artists, which often featured detailed scenes and backgrounds, Kessell's subjects are entirely removed from any sense of background.
