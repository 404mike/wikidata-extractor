In a rehearsal session, Rutherford recalled that the drummer demonstrated he could handle all the material after the first few bars had been played. Despite planning a rehearsal period of three weeks, Rutherford said it was cut short to three days as Phillips had learnt the parts quickly. Rutherford also enlisted his longtime friend and original Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips on keyboards, who had taken further music and piano lessons since his departure from the band in 1970. Rutherford felt he was an obvious choice as his style complemented his songwriting. With the addition of Morris Pert on percussion, the backing tracks were put down prior to the lead vocals. Rutherford deemed his voice unsuitable for singing, and sought a vocalist. The original plan was to have Chris Thompson from Manfred Mann's Earth Band do the vocals, but Rutherford thought his voice was too well known and the singer was unavailable due to other commitments. Rutherford then acquired Noel McCalla of Sniff 'n' the Tears who was once considered as the replacement for Genesis singer and frontman Peter Gabriel after he left the group in 1975. Rutherford played all lead and bass guitars on the album which included an acoustic 6-string Ovation, an electric 12-string Alvarez, his custom made Shergold double neck bass, a Fender Stratocaster for lead parts, an Ibanez, and a Roland guitar synthesiser, from which he acquired a string sound that reminded him of a Polymoog synthesiser.
