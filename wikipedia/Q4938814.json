She married fellow activist Lionel \"Rusty\" Bernstein in March 1941, and together they played prominent roles in the struggle to end Apartheid in South Africa. After her husband was tried and acquitted in the Rivonia Trial in 1964, government harassment forced them to flee to Botswana, an ordeal described in her 1967 book The World that was Ours, which was republished by Persephone Books in 2004. They lived in Britain for some years where she further established herself internationally as a speaker, writer, and artist. She returned with her husband to South Africa in 1994 for the South African election in which fellow activist Nelson Mandela was elected President. She died at the age of 91 in Cape Town, South Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 15", "response": ["*1915 \u2013 Hilda Bernstein, English-South African author and activist (d. 2006)"]}, {"page": "September 8", "response": ["*2006 \u2013 Hilda Bernstein, English-South African author and activist (b. 1915)"]}, {"page": "Bernstein", "response": ["* Hilda Bernstein (1915\u20132006), South African author, artist, activist against apartheid and for women's rights"]}, {"page": "1915 in literature", "response": ["*April 15 \u2013 Hilda Bernstein, English-born author, artist, and anti-apartheid activist (died 2006)"]}, {"page": "1967 in literature", "response": ["*Hilda Bernstein \u2013 The World that was Ours"]}, {"page": "Rivonia Trial", "response": ["Nat Levy was attorney of record in Pretoria for Mandela and the other accused, with the exception of Kantor.\"Jimmy, the Rivonia Trial\u2026and George Bizos\u2019 lamb-on-the-spit\", SA People, 27 May 2011.
