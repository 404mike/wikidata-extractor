In 2015 Ashcroft released Call Me Dave, an unauthorised biography of Cameron written with journalist Isabel Oakeshott, which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as Piggate, in which he allegedly inserted his penis into a dead pig's head.  No evidence for the anecdote has been produced. Many commentators have described the accusations as a \"revenge job\" by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when Cameron came to power in 2010. Ashcroft initially claimed the book was \"not about settling scores\", while Oakeshott said that they had held back publication until after the 2015 general election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives' electoral chances. Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations \"may have been case of mistaken identity\" and has stated that he has a personal \"beef\" with Cameron. Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft's reasons for writing the book were clear and the public could see clearly through it."]}, {"page": "Michael Ashcroft", "response": ["* Call Me Dave: The unauthorised biography of David Cameron, with Isabel Oakeshott, Biteback, 5 October 2015 ()"]}, {"page": "Daily Politics", "response": ["Sunday Politics was divided into a number of clearly defined sections.

During interviews with Essex Police, Huhne exercised his right to remain silent.
