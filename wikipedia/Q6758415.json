Veteran Stuart Bimson had moved on, to Cambridge United, and youngster Paul Mayo was sold to Watford for an initial \u00a375,000, but the acquisitions of Jamie McCombe, Marcus Richardson, Gary Taylor-Fletcher, Francis Green and loanee Kevin Ellison meant that they finished in the play-off places. Lincoln were beaten by Huddersfield Town in the semi-finals.", "In the close season Alexander purchased Gareth McAuley and Ciaran Toner. Toner and Marcus Richardson were later involved in a training ground fracas, and were both allowed to leave on loan with a view to a transfer. Regardless, rumours persisted that the morale of the squad was low both because of this incident, and in relation to the payment of bonuses. Lincoln again finished in the play-off places and played Southend United in the final, again at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Neither side could manage a goal in normal time, and all three strikers had to be replaced in the second half. Derek Asamoah, who was in poor form, was brought on alongside defenders Matt Bloomer and Lee Beevers. However, Southend scored twice in extra time to win."]}, {"page": "List of Troy University alumni", "response": ["*Marcus Richardson, linebacker for the Houston Texans"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["|Marcus Richardson"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["| 12 January 2004 || FW || Marcus Richardson || Lincoln City || Free ||", "| 22 August 2003 || FW || Marcus Richardson || Lincoln City || One month || "]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["|Marcus Richardson"]}]}}
