According to SPR critics John Grant and Eric Dingwall (a member of the SPR), early SPR members such as Henry Sidgwick, Frederic W. H. Myers, and William Barrett hoped to cling to something spiritual through psychical research.Dingwall, Eric (1985). The Need for Responsibility in Parapsychology: My Sixty Years in Psychical Research. In Paul Kurtz. A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. pp. 161\u2013174.  Author John Grant stated that prominent member F. W. H. Myers held that telepathy, according to some speculative explanations, might, in demonstrating that mind could communicate with mind apart from recognised channels, provide evidence supporting the proposition that human personality could continue after the death of the body. \"Thus the supernatural might be proved by science, and psychical research might become, in the words of Sir William Barrett, a handmaid to religion.\"Grant, John (2015). Spooky Science: Debunking the Pseudoscience of the Afterlife. Sterling Publishing. pp. 23\u201324.  Myers stated that \"[T]he Society for Psychical Research was founded, with the establishment of thought-transference\u2014already rising within measurable distance of proof\u2014as its primary aim.\"Woerlee, G. M. (2011). \"Review of Consciousness Beyond Life by Pim van Lommel\". Retrieved 2016-12-19. Defenders of the SPR have stated in reply that \"a 'will to believe' in post-mortem survival, telepathy and other scientifically unpopular notions, does not necessarily exclude a \"will to know\" and thus the capacity for thorough self-criticism, methodological rigour and relentless suspicion of errors.\"", "Some sceptical members have resigned from the SPR. Eric Dingwall resigned and wrote \" After sixty years' experience and personal acquaintance with most of the leading parapsychologists of that period I do not think I could name half a dozen whom I could call objective students who honestly wished to discover the truth. The great majority wanted to prove something or other: They wanted the phenomena into which they were inquiring to serve some purpose in supporting preconceived theories of their own.\""]}, {"page": "Telepathy", "response": ["Psychical researcher Eric Dingwall criticized SPR founding members Frederic W.

Prometheus Books. pp. 161-174.  \"Let me give an example, such as thought-transference, which is as good as any. When the British SPR was founded, the public was led to believe that at least a scientific survey was to be made, and I have no doubt that even some of those closely associated with the early days thought so too. But Myers, among others, had no such intention and cherished no such illusion. He knew that the primary aim of the Society was not objective experimentation but the establishment of telepathy. (...) What was wanted was proof that mind could communicate with mind apart from the normal avenues, for if mental sharing was a fact when the persons concerned were incarnate it could plausibly be suggested that the same mechanism might operate when death had occurred. Thus the supernatural might be proved by science, and psychical research might become, in the words of Sir William Barrett, a handmaid to religion.\""]}, {"page": "Frederic W. H. Myers", "response": ["Some historians have suggested that Myers was strongly biased to believe in the paranormal and held a secret religious agenda. After the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859), it was difficult for those with a scientific education to retain a belief in tenets of the Judeo-Christian religion.Grant, John. (2015). Spooky Science: Debunking the Pseudoscience of the Afterlife. Sterling Publishing. pp. 23\u201324.  Early SPR members like Myers and Henry Sidgwick hoped to cling to something spiritual through psychical research.

To understand why this was so it is necessary to realize the position in which so many educated and intelligent people found themselves during the 1870s and later in Victorian England. With the emergence of new scientific concepts touching the origin of man and his place in the universe, the very foundations of their religious beliefs began to give way.\""]}, {"page": "Materialization (paranormal)", "response": ["*Harry Price and Eric Dingwall.
