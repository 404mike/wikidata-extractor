Owen injured his hamstring once again while playing against Middlesbrough in January. He remained out of action for well over a month and later received treatment from German doctor Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt.

When Reid was sacked in October and replaced by Howard Wilkinson, Flo immediately fell out of favour \u2013 failing to make the bench for Wilkinson's first game \u2013 as Wilkinson publicly called into question the Norwegian's fitness.

He played a crucial role in Villa's League Cup second round victory against Wycombe Wanderers in September. With Villa trailing 3\u20131 at half time, Baro\u0161 scored shortly after the beginning of the second half and won a penalty, which Gareth Barry converted. He also provided the cross for Barry's second goal of the game as Villa scored seven goals in the second half, resulting in a final score of 8\u20133, their biggest win in over 40 years. He set up the first Aston Villa goal in a November match against Sunderland in dubious circumstances; back-heeling the ball, which \"looked to have gone out of play\" to Aaron Hughes.

In March 1999 Quinn again had to play in goal, this time replacing the injured Thomas S\u00f8rensen in a game against Bradford City. In similar circumstances to when playing for Manchester City against Derby County in 1991 Quinn scored and then went in goal, and kept a clean sheet to help his side win. He also has the distinction of being the first player to score at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, against Manchester City in 1997. He became a local legend at Sunderland, winning both the Sunderland and North East Sportswriters' Player of the Year awards in 1999 after scoring 21 goals in Sunderland's record-breaking Division One title-winning season.
