As of early 2017, no news had surfaced on whether the planned reboot was still going ahead. On 12 April 2017, Sothcott confirmed to thehollywoodnews that he was no longer involved with the film series. As of September 2019, three Carry On films were set to be filmed back-to-back, after Brian Baker won the rights to the movies following a legal battle with ITV earlier that year. Production of the new films had been planned to take place in spring 2020. However, filming was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and little more was heard about the project until after the death of Barbara Windsor in December 2020, when Brian Baker announced that he will be using old footage of the actress in the film, saying \"Barbara will be making an appearance.\" Baker told the Daily Star Sunday that \u2018we have got two new stories and we are looking to do one of the old ones again to bring it up to modern day quality - probably Carry On Sergeant.\u2019"]}, {"page": "The Dark Side (magazine)", "response": ["At the time it suspended publication, The Dark Side's regular contributors included John Martin, Calum Waddell, Alan Jones, Eileen Daly, Jason Slater, Jonathan Sothcott and Brad Stevens.

The film will be distributed, in the UK and Ireland, by Bulldog Film Distribution. Parkland Pictures has acquired worldwide sales rights. Producer Jonathan Sothcott stated that the film was influenced by gangster films such as The Long Good Friday and Sexy Beast and horror films such as The Purge and You're Next.", "The film has received mixed reviews. Tom Joliffe stated that the film gives Billy Murray 'centre stage, and an opportunity to exude' his 'magnetic charisma'. In Jolliffe's view, 'Murray, even approaching 80, revels in being the headline act' and plays 'brilliantly off Nick Moran (who is superb in the film), as two opposing forces collide again after years apart'. Roger Crow described the film as 'a slick, polished and at times nasty crime saga, which is just what you want from the genre'. Crow praised Bruce Payne for giving a 'brief but stunning turn as Damien, the arch bad guy' and also stated that Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott gave 'a brave, at times jaw-dropping performance as the photogenic matriarch Sadie'. Crow also opined that the film is producer Jonathan Sothcott's 'best offering to date'. Todd Gaines stated that the film is 'a bit different than your typical gangster flick' and 'is entertaining throughout its entire runtime'. Gaines praised 'Nick Moran\u2019s performance as Frank'. Another reviewer stated that 'Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott as Morgan\u2019s long suffering wife Sadie, puts in a really ballsy performance', but that Billy Murray and Nick Moran 'carry proceedings throughout doing all the heavy lifting'. They concluded that 'for fans of the genre [gangster thrillers], Nemesis is going to be a big hit as all the tropes are in there, guns, blood, violence, betrayal, unnecessary nudity and a lot of sneering and swearing'. In their view, Nemesis 'manages this with a tight run time, decent cast and interesting spin on the same formula'. Jeff Turner stated that Nemesis 'is a good solid home invasion thriller which has a nostalgic 70s feel to it, you could almost visualize Charles Bronson leading a movie like this'. Turner also stated that 'Billy Murray and co-star Jeanine Nerissa Sothcott deliver great performances as John Morgan and Sadie Morgan' and that Lucy Aarden (who played Zoe) was 'outstanding'. "]}]}}
