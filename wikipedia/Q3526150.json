He was one of Yorkshire's main players in the club's outstanding years, when they won eight County Championships out of ten.\nThough Smailes was never a player of the class of Sutcliffe, Hutton, Bowes, Verity or Leyland, he was extremely valuable to Yorkshire because of his versatility. He could bowl either swingers as a new ball partner to Bowes, or later off-breaks when pitches were affected by rain. He was also a dangerous left-handed batsman who scored over a thousand runs in 1938, with centuries against Glamorgan and Surrey.\nHe lost his best potential cricketing years to the cessation of competitive cricket during World War II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Frank Smailes"]}, {"page": "Brian Close", "response": ["In February 1949, Close underwent a medical examination with the British Army, but due to an injury he had suffered playing football his call-up was delayed by a few months, allowing him to continue into pre-season training with Yorkshire. His performance in pre-season was such that he was given a trial for the county in the two first-class matches against Cambridge and Oxford Universities. He made his debut on 11 May 1949, alongside Fred Trueman and Frank Lowson \u2013 all three went on to play for England. Close impressed the Yorkshire hierarchy enough for his trial to be extended into the County Championship season; Bill Bowes, one of Yorkshire's coaches, declared that he was the \"natural successor to the veteran all-rounder Frank Smailes\". Close continued to perform well, particularly his bowling; in his fifth first-class game, against Essex, Close took five for 58 in Essex's first innings, then top-scored with an undefeated 88 runs in the Yorkshire innings. His performances for Yorkshire earned him a place in the North v South match, which was also being used as a trial for selection for the upcoming Test matches against New Zealand. Close scored two runs, and did not take a wicket; The Times described his batting as a \"disappointing feature\" of the match, but noted that despite not taking any wickets, \"he bowled his off-breaks round the wicket well enough.\""]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["Miller came in at the start of the second day's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added, before falling at 7/86, part of a collapse of 5/27.

They added 126 in 75 minutes of which Bartlett scored 94. The bowlers were Bill Bowes, Hedley Verity, Frank Smailes, Emmott Robinson and Cyril Turner. He hit seven sixes (all off Verity) and nine fours. In two overs by Verity, Bartlett scored 062660 and 006606.

At the end of the year, he retired from first-class cricket and Yorkshire awarded him a special grant of \u00a3250. Yorkshire did have a replacement in mind; Frank Smailes was considered to be versatile enough in his bowling style to take Macaulay's place, but it was not until Ellis Robinson secured a place in 1937 that a new specialist off-spinner was found.Hodgson, p. 145."]}, {"page": "1939 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire were captained by Brian Sellers, whose efforts earned him a place in Wisdens \"Five Cricketers of the Year\".

Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches.

Bedser and batting all-rounder Jack Ikin were the only \"new\" players in that they had made two and five first-class appearances respectively before the war and each of them was now in his first full season.

Yorkshire had a comparatively poor season by their recent standards and finished 6th in the County Championship behind Lancashire.  The team was never really settled and the loss of Holmes resulted in a number of opening partnerships being tried.  Sutcliffe generally opened with Mitchell but Barber also opened and so, in 14 matches, did a rising star from Pudsey called Len Hutton, who was 18 in June 1934.  Sutcliffe and Hutton opened for Yorkshire in one championship match in 1934 which was the game against Essex at The Circle, Kingston upon Hull, in July.  They shared 14 in the first innings but then Hutton was out and Sutcliffe went on to make 166.  In the second innings, Hutton opened with Mitchell and was out without scoring.  Sutcliffe did not bat and Yorkshire won comfortably by 123 runs.  Yorkshire had too many players missing several matches each: the team played 30 championship games but none of Bowes, Leyland, Macaulay, Sutcliffe or Verity managed to appear in 20.  Cyril Turner and Frank Smailes became first-team regulars.", "Yorkshire regained the County ChampionshipWebber, pp.72\u201374. and this owed much to the strength of the opening partnership as Sutcliffe and Hutton scored 3550 runs between them in championship matches.  Other good scores were achieved by Barber, Leyland, Mitchell, Turner, Sellers, Wood and Yardley.  Frank Smailes was a very useful all-rounder and Ellis Robinson was successful with his off spin but Verity was again the outstanding bowler.  Bowes missed several championship matches but still averaged about four wickets per game."]}, {"page": "1946 County Championship", "response": ["Captained by Brian Sellers, Yorkshire's success was chiefly due to its two main bowlers Ellis Robinson and Arthur Booth who took 167 and 111 wickets respectively in all first-class matches.  Yorkshire's pace bowlers were the veteran Bill Bowes, who played for England in 1946, and future England player Alec Coxon.  They took 65 and 69 wickets respectively.  Seamer Frank Smailes, who also played for England against India, took 76 wickets.  Booth was the season's surprise success as he was then 43 and had been a Minor Counties player before the war.  Yorkshire had recalled him after many years absence as a replacement for the late Hedley Verity and Booth made the most of frequently damp conditions that suited his type of slow left arm bowling.  Yorkshire's batting depended heavily on Len Hutton, supported by veterans Wilf Barber and Maurice Leyland.  Norman Yardley batted well and took part in a Test trial."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Yorkshire were strong in all departments. The mainstay of the team was their world-class opening batsman Herbert Sutcliffe, whose career spanned the whole inter-war period. He had two significant opening partners in Percy Holmes and the young Len Hutton. Maurice Leyland was another regular England batsman and Yorkshire could also rely on Wilf Barber, Arthur Mitchell and Edgar Oldroyd. Opposing batsmen always knew that they would face a formidable attack, not least the two all-time greats Wilfred Rhodes through the 1920s and his successor Hedley Verity in the thirties. Yorkshire also called upon England bowlers George Macaulay, Roy Kilner, Abe Waddington, Bill Bowes and Frank Smailes. The redoubtable Emmott Robinson was a good bowler too, as was his namesake Ellis Robinson (no relation) in the late 1930s. Yorkshire's main wicket-keepers were Arthur Dolphin, who had made his debut in 1905, and Arthur Wood; they both played for England."]}]}}
