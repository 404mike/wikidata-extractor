He was one of Yorkshire's main players in the club's outstanding years, when they won eight County Championships out of ten.\nThough Smailes was never a player of the class of Sutcliffe, Hutton, Bowes, Verity or Leyland, he was extremely valuable to Yorkshire because of his versatility. He could bowl either swingers as a new ball partner to Bowes, or later off-breaks when pitches were affected by rain. He was also a dangerous left-handed batsman who scored over a thousand runs in 1938, with centuries against Glamorgan and Surrey.\nHe lost his best potential cricketing years to the cessation of competitive cricket during World War II.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
