Bruce's brother Robert first discovered the indigenous Assamese tea plant in 1823 and told Charles of its existence before his death. In 1824, Bruce fought in the First Anglo-Burmese War, during which he was posted to Sadiya and made commandant of a division of gunboats.In 1835, Bruce was charged by the British East India Company to start tea plantations, and in 1836 resigned his commission with the gunboat flotilla when he was appointed as the superintendent of the Assam tea plantations. At first, the East India Company tried to plant Chinese tea in Assam, but the Chinese plants cross-pollinated with the indigenous tea plants and the experiment was considered a disaster. In Sadiya, Bruce, acting on his own initiative, planted a nursery that consisted just of indigenous plants. In 1836, he sent a sample of the manufactured tea to the tea committee in Delhi. Lord Auckland approved this and tea experts stated that the tea was \"of good quality\". By 1837, Bruce had a consignment delivered to the tea committee \u2013 the consignment consisted of 46 chests filled with tea from the indigenous plants. Eight chests weighing 350 pounds were sent to be auctioned in London on 10 January 1839.In 1838, Bruce wrote An Account of the Manufacture of the Black Tea, As Now Practised at Suddeya in Upper Assam, By The Chinamen Sent Thither For That Purpose. In 1871, Bruce received the gold medal from the Royal Society of Arts for cultivation of the indigenous tea plants in Assam. Bruce died aged seventy-eight in Assam, where he was buried in the Christian graveyard at Tezpur.", "link_mentions": {}}}
