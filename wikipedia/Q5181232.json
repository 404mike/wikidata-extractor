He made a number of appearances in his first year but missed the whole of the following season, 1994\u201395. He did manage to return to the side but a shoulder injury towards the end of the season meant he was released by the club in 1996. He signed for Cardiff City and quickly became a first team regular and would be a vital part of the Cardiff team for the next three years before falling out of favour and, after a short loan spell at Plymouth Argyle, left to join Halifax Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1980s", "response": ["Coventry scorer: Craig Middleton"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["* Craig Middleton - Cambridge United"]}]}}
