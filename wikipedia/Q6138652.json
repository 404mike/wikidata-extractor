He was particularly close to his younger brother Archie, who later captained England. He attended Elstree School and Harrow School, where he coached as a cricketer and was later joined by Archie. He also received coaching at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, where his father was treasurer of Lancashire County Cricket Club. He played in the Harrow first team between 1886 and 1888, and was appointed captain in his final year.
