During the Angolan Civil War, he wrote about South Africa's involvement in Angola and in the 1990s he revealed human rights abuses committed by UNITA rebels under the command of Jonas Savimbi. Critics have derided his biography of Savimbi, Jonas Savimbi: A Key to Africa, as the work of an apologist. Bridgland has denied this claim in interviews, saying rather he was just a biographer.Bridgland has also written 3 books, including: The War for Africa: Twelve Months That Transformed a Continent, Jonas Savimbi: A Key to Africa, and Katiza's Journey", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jonas Savimbi", "response": ["There are considerable differences in the source material about the date of Savimbi's official induction into the UPA.   Fred Bridgland, who wrote a much-cited biography of Savimbi, says that Savimbi was \"inducted into the UPA\u201d on February 1, 1961.  Nonetheless, he may not have officially joined the UPA until late 1961.", "In 1994, UNITA signed a new peace accord. Savimbi declined the vice-presidency that was offered to him and again renewed fighting in 1998. Savimbi also reportedly purged some of those within UNITA whom he may have seen as threats to his leadership or as questioning his strategic course. Savimbi's foreign secretary Tito Chingunji and his entire extended family of over 50 people were murdered in 1991 after Savimbi suspected that Chingunji had been in secret, unapproved negotiations with the Angolan government during Chingunji's various diplomatic assignments in Europe and the United States. Savimbi denied his involvement in the Chingunji killing and blamed it on UNITA dissidents. Fred Bridgland, in his book The War for Africa: Twelve Months that Transformed a Continent, reports that in an earlier episode, called Red September Savimbi oversaw the torture and killing of dozens of people including over 2 score of his own officers, their wifes and children in a bizarre witchcraft ritual. He also had Aurora Katalayo (widow of charismatic guerilla leader Mateus Katalaoy - who Savimba had killed a few years earlier) and her 4-year old son thrown into a burning fire for the crime of witchcraft Savimbi called \"Swissification\" (Auroro had studied medicine in Switzerland). {{Citation | url = https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5152671-the-war-for-africa | title =  The War For Africa: Twelve Months That Transformed A Continent", "by Fred Bridgland."]}, {"page": "Emma Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne", "response": [" The South African national had been part of the so-called Mandela United Football Club, the bodyguards of Winnie Mandela.

Some blamed his murder on UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who purportedly viewed Chingunji as a political threat. Fred Bridgland  Savimbi's biographer and longtime supporter claimed that between 60 and 70 of Chingunji's relatives were killed following his own execution, including his own children who were swung against trees. Savimbi, however, suggested his killing was more likely the work of UNITA dissidents or the Central Intelligence Agency, which, Savimbi argued, had supported Chingunji in an effort to overthrow him.\"Angolan rebel lays killings to a CIA plot,\" The New York Times, May 5, 1992."]}, {"page": "Evelyn Mase", "response": ["Amid growing speculation that Mandela would be released from prison in 1990, Mase pinned a notice to the gate of her house asking media to leave her alone. One reporter, Fred Bridgland, did manage to obtain an interview. Mase was angry at the way Mandela's release was being anticipated, believing that it was being treated like the second coming of Christ and proclaiming: \"How can a man who has committed adultery and left his wife and children be Christ? The whole world worships Nelson too much. He is only a man.\" After Mandela became South Africa's first black president following the 1994 general election, Mase again spoke to a journalist, noting that when she was going door to door to spread the Jehovah's Witness message, she often saw Mandela's picture adorning people's walls. She stated that Mandela's \"strength has come from God\" and that \"God uses people to do his work even if they are not righteous.\""]}, {"page": "The Resurrection of Winnie Mandela", "response": ["Msimang's biography was published in September 2018, a month before another biography of Mandela, Truth, Lies and Alibis: A Winnie Mandela Story by Fred Bridgland. Msimang admired Mandela to a certain extent, and says she came to have a more nuanced view of Mandela. Where Mandela was typically cast either as a saint or a demon, Msimang acknowledges the good Mandela did without, she says, denying her guilt in the death of Stompie Moeketsi, or in the disappearance of two young men accused of being police informers who were abducted in 1988 and murdered soon after. Msimang's interest is in giving what she considers a more honest appraisal: Mandela's actions need to be regarded in the context of other violence condoned or enacted by the ANC and its members; in other words, she was no radical. In addition, she needs to be judged also in the light of the racism and sexism of her time; sexist double standards were often applied in judging her. Msimang disagrees with Bridgland on some factual details; for instance, Mandela's alleged culpability in the shooting death of Abu Baker Asvat is based on nothing but rumors, she wrote.

More than once it attempted to frame activists as police informants. Stratcom's activities in relation to media propaganda appear to have grown out of initiatives and networks established by the government in the 1970s and publicly exposed in the 1978 Information Scandal. McPherson, the former head of Stratcom at the Branch, claimed that the Branch nurtured a network of \"friendly\" journalists, some of whom were paid Branch informants. At the TRC, he announced that he had provided the Commissioners with a confidential list of journalists who had been \"friendly\" with, sporadically on the payroll of, or regularly on the payroll of the Security Branch. This list might well have been unreliable \u2013 the one name McPherson disclosed at the hearing he later withdrew when the journalist in question, Fred Bridgland, strenuously denied the allegation. However, the revelations about Stratcom, and the list of friendly journalists in particular, have occasionally been revivified in post-apartheid South Africa, through accusations that certain individuals were or remain \"Stratcom agents.\""]}]}}
