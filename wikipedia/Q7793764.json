A Marian exile, he was one of the Geneva Bible translators. On his return to England, he had trouble with conformity to the Anglican practices. With Laurence Humphrey, he played a leading part in the vestments controversy, a division along religious party lines in the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I of England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geneva Bible", "response": ["During the reign of Queen Mary I of England (1553\u201358), a number of Protestant scholars fled from England to Geneva, Switzerland, which was then ruled as a republic in which John Calvin and, later, Theodore Beza, provided the primary spiritual and theological leadership.  Among these scholars was William Whittingham, who supervised the translation now known as the Geneva Bible, in collaboration with Myles Coverdale, Christopher Goodman, Anthony Gilby, Thomas Sampson, and William Cole; several of this group later became prominent figures in the Vestments controversy. Whittingham was directly responsible for the New Testament, which was complete and published in 1557,. while Gilby oversaw the Old Testament."]}, {"page": "16th century in literature", "response": ["**William Whittingham, Anthony Gilby, Thomas Sampson \u2013 Geneva Bible"]}, {"page": "1589 in literature", "response": ["*Unknown date \u2013 Thomas Sampson, English theologian and translator (born c. 1517)"]}, {"page": "Elizabethan Religious Settlement", "response": ["The alternative title was less offensive to Catholic members of Parliament, but this was unlikely to have been the only reason for the alteration. It was also a concession to the Queen's Protestant supporters who objected to \"supreme head\" on theological grounds and who had concerns about a female leading the Church. John Calvin, an influential Continental reformer, had called Henry VIII's claim to supreme headship blasphemy. Thomas Sampson, a Marian exile, believed that \"All scripture seems to assign the title of head of the Church to Christ alone\"."]}, {"page": "Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon", "response": ["Henry entered the household of his great-uncle Cardinal Reginald Pole and followed him in his visits of Calais, Flanders and the monasteries of Smithfield, London. The two men also escorted the later Philip II of Spain from the Seventeen Provinces to the Kingdom of England for his marriage to Mary. Despite his personal loyalty to Mary and his great-uncle, Hastings practised Calvinism and showed little financial restraint in supporting his puritan beliefs.

In spite of Bullinger's advice, Humphrey refused to conform; and Parker wished to deprive him as well as Sampson. But the presidency of Magdalen was elective and the visitor of the college was not Parker but the Bishop of Winchester; and Humphrey escaped with temporary retirement. Parker, in fact, was not supported by the council; in 1566 Humphrey was selected to preach at St Paul's Cross, and was allowed to do so without the vestments."]}, {"page": "Vestments controversy", "response": ["Anticipating further problems with vestments, Thomas Sampson corresponded with Peter Martyr Vermigli on the matter. Martyr's advice, along with Bullinger's, was to accept vestments but also to preach against them. However, Sampson, Lever, and others were unsatisfied with the lack of such protest from Elizabeth's bishops, such as Cox, Edmund Grindal, Pilkington, Sandys, Jewel, and Parkhurst, even though some, like Sandys and Grindal, were reluctant conformists with nonconformist sympathies. Archbishop Parker, consecrated by the anti-vestiarian Miles Coverdale, was also a major source of discontent."]}, {"page": "Marian exiles", "response": ["Members of the English church in Geneva included Sir William Stafford, Sir John Burtwick, John Bodley and the eldest of his five sons (Laurence, Thomas, and Josias who was later knighted), James Pilkington, John Scory, Thomas Bentham, William Cole, William Kethe, Thomas Sampson, Anthony Gilby, John Pullein, Perceval Wiburne, and Robert Fills."]}, {"page": "List of Puritans", "response": ["*Thomas Sampson"]}, {"page": "Edward King (bishop of Elphin)", "response": ["He married firstly Anne Coxsed  of Cambridgeshire  and secondly Grace Sampson, daughter  of Nathaniel Sampson of Leicestershire, and granddaughter of the noted preacher Thomas Sampson, prebendary  of St. Paul's Cathedral.Burke's Peerage Tenth edition London 1848   By two marriages he had at least fifteen  children.

He was obliged to make a full recantation of his published opinions, and a protest in writing of his dutiful obedience to the queen's person and her lawful government.  In June he was again examined before Archbishop Matthew Parker, and forbidden to preach. He complained (26 July) to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester of his hard treatment.
