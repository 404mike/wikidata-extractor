The airfoils will spin the same direction regardless of the direction of airflow. The Wells turbine has both benefits and drawbacks. It has no moving parts other than the main turbine rotor, making it easier to maintain and more cost effective. However, it sacrifices some efficiency at high airflow rates because the airfoil's high angle of attack creates more drag. The angle of attack is the number of degrees the airfoil is from being parallel with the airflow. Wells turbines are most efficient at low speed airflows."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1977", "response": ["#Alan Arthur Wells  (d. 2005)"]}]}}
