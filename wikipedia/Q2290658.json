He attended school in Hackney at Upton House Comprehensive, and whilst there he appeared in the opera Tosca at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.\nHe helped out Def Leppard in August 1986 and played alongside Rick Allen who had lost his left arm in a car accident in December 1984. However, during Def Leppard's warm-up mini tour of Ireland, Rich missed a gig, and the rest of the band realised Allen could drum alone.\nRich played with Stretch, Judie Tzuke and the Climax Blues Band prior to joining Status Quo, where in  late 1985 he replaced Pete Kircher on drums. In April 2000, Rich announced his intention to leave Status Quo after 15 years in the group, due to exhaustion and family commitments. He was replaced on drums by Matt Letley.\nDuring his time with Status Quo, Rich used Paiste cymbals and Premier drums, with a 22\" Tama bass drum. Up until the Under the Influence tour in 1999, Rich had his cymbals free floating from a steel frame, which fans noted as making him look like he was 'drumming in a cage'.\nAfter leaving Status Quo, he began touring schools across the UK giving masterclasses in drumming and percussion, which he continues today. He approximates that he's given 6,500 separate masterclasses across the country. Rich also is drumming for 'Stealer', a tribute band to Free.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Def Leppard", "response": ["On 31 December 1984, drummer Rick Allen lost his left arm in a car crash on the A57 in the hills outside the band's home city of Sheffield. Allen was driving with his Dutch girlfriend, Miriam Barendsen, when his Corvette swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms. He then worked with Simmons to design a custom electronic drum kit.Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997 The other members of the band supported Allen's recovery and never sought a replacement. Allen was placed in a separate studio to practice his new drums. After a few months, Allen gathered the band together and performed the intro to the Led Zeppelin version of \"When the Levee Breaks\" to showcase his progress to the band. Joe Elliott reports this as being a \"very emotional moment.\" During this period, Mutt Lange returned as producer. Def Leppard brought in Jeff Rich in August 1986 to play alongside Allen during Def Leppard's warm-up mini tour of Ireland. When Rich turned up late for a gig, he and the band realised Allen could drum alone. Allen's comeback was sealed at the 1986 Monsters of Rock festival in England, with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by Joe Elliott.[ Def Leppard Biography]. Billboard.
