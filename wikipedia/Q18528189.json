Distressed, Jones concentrated on art. Petra's long neck and high forehead would continue as female features in his artwork. He returned to live with his parents at Brockley, also spending time at a house they rented on the coast at Portslade. He painted prolifically and exhibited watercolour seascapes and Welsh landscapes in London galleries. In 1927 Jones made friends with Jim Ede, at the Tate Gallery, who introduced him to art critics and prospective buyers, including Helen Sutherland, who became a patron. Ede introduced him to the painter Ben Nicholson, who in 1928 had Jones elected to the Seven and Five Society,  whose other members included Barbara Hepworth, Winifred Nicholson, Cedric Morris, Christopher Wood, and Henry Moore. Jones remained a member until 1935, when he was expelled by Nicholson for not painting abstracts. Disappointed by published accounts of personal combat experience during the war, in 1928 he began writing In Parenthesis, a fictional work based on his own experiences in the trenches. He was now in love with Prudence Pelham, who was its muse.", "In 1947 Jones created ten land-and-skyscapes at Helen Sutherland's house in Cumberland during a single week. As in 1932, this burst of creative activity precipitated a nervous collapse. He underwent psychotherapy at Bowen House in Harrow, where he was helped by the psychologist William ('Bill') Stevenson. Influenced by Freud, Stevenson traced Jones's breakdown to Oedipal and sibling tensions, in combination with repressed fear during the war, explaining that, allowed to strengthen, repression in the sexual domain shifted to repression of artistic freedom. He advised Jones to paint and write as essential to his healing. As a result, Jones was able throughout the 1950s to make many beautiful painted inscriptions (an artform that he invented), along with sometimes numinous still-lifes of flowers in glass chalices. And he was able to publish, in 1952, his second epic-length poem The Anathemata."]}, {"page": "Richard Denman", "response": ["Denman married first Helen Sutherland, in 1904; they had separated by 1909.

Lyon kept in contact with the Group's members, and wrote his MA thesis on his educational project with the Group. Over the next few years the work of the Group was noticed and praised by a number of prominent British artists and critics, such as Julian Trevelyan and Henry Moore. Their work was collected by prominent figures such as Helen Sutherland."]}, {"page": "Helen Christian Sutherland", "response": ["#REDIRECT Helen Sutherland"]}]}}
