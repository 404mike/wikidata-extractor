About 550 AD he founded a monastery at Meifod. This establishment became the mother church of several other monasteries and was a centre of the order for over one thousand years, and within a generation the monastery had become a centre of pilgrimage.\nGwyddfarch taught Tysilio, who replaced him as abbot.Legend holds that near the end of his life Tysilio talked the aging abbot out of a pilgrimage to Rome.\nHe is commemorated on 3 November.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brochwel Ysgithrog", "response": ["Powys has been frequently called \"the land of Brochwel\", but little is recorded of the events of this monarch's reign. Some details are available from Old Welsh poetry, but this is difficult to interpret, and none of the extant poems about this period seem to pre-date the 9th century. Some are from as late as the 11th century. Brochwel is presented as a warrior hero and ruler of wide lands. These sources suggest that he was passionately fond of hunting, and one of his chief resorts was the Vale of Meifod which he made his \"May-Abode\" or summer residence. On his summer visits to Mathrafal, he often visited the shrine of St. Gwyddfarch. Upon his saintly son, St Tysilio, he bestowed the Bishopric of that part of his kingdom. St Tysilio and Brochwel are linked with the foundation of the Church at Meifod, but none of the stones of the current Church of St. Mary date from this period."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh saints", "response": ["|Gwyddfarch"]}]}}
