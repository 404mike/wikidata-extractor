Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945\u201346 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team.

However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting a transfer. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy.

In addition to playing professional football at Roker Park, Bingham continued his shipbuilding apprenticeship on the Sunderland shipyards. His speed and ball-control made him a popular player with the \"Black Cats\", and he gradually worked his way into Bill Murray's first team plans in 1950\u201351. He established himself as the first choice outside-right in 1951\u201352, however he lost his place to Tommy Wright in 1952\u201353. He made just 19 appearances in 1953\u201354, as Wright continued to hold on to his first team place. Bingham regained his place in 1954\u201355, scoring ten goals in 42 games, as Sunderland finished fourth in the First Division, four points behind champions Chelsea. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they lost to Manchester City at Villa Park. They slipped to ninth in 1955\u201356, and again exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals, this time losing 3\u20130 to Birmingham City. The 1956\u201357 campaign started poorly, and Bingham was dropped in October; he put in a transfer request, which was turned down. New boss Alan Brown signed outside-right Amby Fogarty from Glentoran, and led the club to relegation in 1957\u201358. Out of the first team, Bingham fell out with Brown, and left the club in the summer on a \u00a38,000 transfer to top-flight Luton Town.

These credit notes were passed on to players. In total, just over \u00a35,000 (\u00a3 today) was handled in this way.
