Concerning his disposition, Hippocrates was first portrayed as a \"kind, dignified, old country doctor\" and later as \"stern and forbidding\".

Aretaeus of Cappadocia, living in the second century in the same area, recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea, causing a debilitation of the whole body. His \"C\u0153liac Affection\" (coeliac from Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 koiliakos, \"abdominal\") gained the attention of Western medicine when Francis Adams presented a translation of Aretaeus's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856. The patient described in Aretaeus' work had stomach pain and was atrophied, pale, feeble, and incapable of work. The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white, malodorous, and flatulent, and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return. The problem, Aretaeus believed, was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body, this incomplete digestion resulting in diarrhoea. He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women, explicitly excluding children. The cause, according to Aretaeus, was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming \"a copious draught of cold water.\""]}, {"page": "Hippocratic Corpus", "response": ["The writing style of the Corpus has been remarked upon for centuries, being described by some as, \"clear, precise, and simple\".. It is often praised for its objectivity and conciseness, yet some have criticised it as being \"grave and austere\".
