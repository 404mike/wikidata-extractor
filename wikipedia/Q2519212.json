The series portrays his rise from lieutenant to rear-admiral in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. The twenty (and one incomplete draft)-book series encompasses Aubrey's adventures and various commands along his course to flying a rear-admiral's flag.\nSome of his naval battles and adventures are drawn from Royal Navy history. Several of his exploits and reverses, most importantly those in the plots of Master and Commander, The Reverse of the Medal and Blue at the Mizzen, are directly based on the chequered career of Thomas Cochrane. Often in the other 17 novels in the series, Aubrey may witness an action or hear of one that is drawn from history, while the battles or other encounters with ships he captains are fictional.\nBesides reaching the peak of naval skills and authority, Aubrey is presented as being interested in mathematics and astronomy, a great lover of music and player of the violin, a hearty singer and is generally accompanied by his friend and shipmate Stephen Maturin on the cello. He is noted for his mangling and mis-splicing of proverbs, sometimes with Maturin's involvement, such as \u201cNever count the bear\u2019s skin before it is hatched\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot.\u201d Aubrey is played by Russell Crowe in the 2003 film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World and by David Robb in the BBC Radio 4 adaptations of the novels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amati", "response": ["* Patrick O'Brian's fictional British sea captain Jack Aubrey is described as owning a \"fiddle far above his station, an Amati no less\", in The Surgeon's Mate.

Maturin has travelled to Minorca with a patient who died there, leaving him penniless and stranded. A chance meeting with Jack Aubrey at a musical performance in the governor's house at Port Mahon did not go well, as Aubrey was despondent about his seemingly stalled naval career and Maturin was frustrated by his own situation, leading to some harsh words. However, Aubrey received a promotion later that evening and was in a much better mood when he ran across Maturin again the next day, leading to a fast friendship and an offer to be the ship's surgeon aboard Aubrey's first command, HMS Sophie, a fictional brig-rigged sloop-of-war. Being that ships' surgeons in that era usually received very limited training or advanced education, the officers and crew of the Sophie are very pleased to have a true physician on board. Their esteem for Maturin's medical skill increases early on when he successfully performs delicate surgery on deck, repairing a crew member's serious head injury by removing a damaged portion of his skull and replacing it with a coin hammered flat. The feat is witnessed by most of the crew, and they mention it several times in subsequent books in the series.", "As a passionate advocate of Catalan independence and a resolute opponent of Bonaparte's tyranny, Maturin had become involved in intelligence gathering, and as he begins his career with the Royal Navy, he becomes a valued volunteer secret agent for the Admiralty. His political and intelligence missions are of such vital importance that Jack Aubrey is often sent to far-flung corners of the world primarily to discreetly allow his apparent ship's surgeon to perform a task for the British government. His work put him in some difficult and dangerous situations, particularly when he was captured and tortured in Port Mahon in HMS Surprise, the third novel in the series. While being held by French intelligence agents, Maturin was subjected to the rack (among other implements), making him a temporary invalid and permanently damaging his hands. Aubrey leads a cutting-out mission to save his friend, who spends the next few months recuperating. The extent of the torture is revealed slowly across the novels following it.", "Maturin is habitually untidy or even disreputable in appearance; he spends as little as possible on clothes, preferring an \"old rusty coat\" unless the occasion calls for dressier clothes. As a physician, he often wears an old periwig over his sparse close-cropped hair. His frugal personal habits persist despite a considerable share of prize money earned over the years, and a fortune inherited from his Catalan godfather in The Reverse of the Medal. He uses part of his fortune to buy the recently decommissioned HMS Surprise, giving its command to Jack Aubrey when he had been framed for stock manipulation and temporarily lost his commission. Surprise was a letter of marque, and later as His Majesty's Hired Vessel when Aubrey is restored to the Navy List.", "He is renowned for his ability to nearly drown, and his frequent falls from every manner of ship are a bit of a running joke in the series.  While fairly sure-footed on land, he manages to get into mortal peril in even the calmest water \u2013 allowing Jack Aubrey to demonstrate his proficiency at diving rescues \u2013 and is prone to plunging down hatches and companionways on board ship. His clumsiness may (in part) be due to his torture by the French at Mahon early in the book series that left his hands permanently injured. Despite this, he is a crack shot with both pistol and rifle, and is an expert swordsman and veteran duelist, and continues to perform successful surgeries.", "In reviewing the film made from the series of books, Christopher Hitchens finds \"the summa of O'Brian's genius was the invention of Dr. Stephen Maturin. He is the ship's gifted surgeon, but he is also a scientist, an espionage agent for the Admiralty, a man of part Irish and part Catalan birth\u2014and a revolutionary. He joins the British side, having earlier fought against it, because of his hatred for Bonaparte's betrayal of the principles of 1789\u2014principles that are perfectly obscure to bluff Capt. Jack Aubrey. Any cinematic adaptation of O'Brian must stand or fall by its success in representing this figure. On this the film doesn't even fall, let alone stand. It skips the whole project.\" He finds the film's action scenes more inspirational: \"In one respect the action lives up to its fictional and actual inspiration.

Jack Aubrey. Any cinematic adaptation of O'Brian must stand or fall by its success in representing this figure. On this the film doesn't even fall, let alone stand. It skips the whole project.\" He finds the action scenes more inspirational: \"In one respect the action lives up to its fictional and actual inspiration.
