In the 19th\u00a0century, when under the care of George Warren, 2nd Baron de Tabley (1811\u201387), its structural condition was maintained, and it continued to be furnished with old furniture.  Retired employees of the family lived in the house, and kept an eye on the family's children who used it as a playhouse.  Following the weddings of two of Lord de\u00a0Tabley's daughters in the 1860s, celebratory balls were held in the hall.  When the Cheshire Yeomanry met on the estate, the officers dined in the new house, while the other ranks used the old hall.  The old hall was also used to host tours demonstrating the history of the family.  From the 1870s, Lord de\u00a0Tabley kept his collection of historical objects and curiosities in the great hall, creating it into a museum.  He also used the old hall as a lending library for local residents.  His heir, John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley (1835\u201395), lived for most of the time in London rather than at Tabley, and visited only occasionally.  His employees continued to live in the old hall, and he dined there each year at the time of the annual audit.  He allowed the general public to walk through the grounds if they attended services at the chapel, and also gave permission for groups and organisations to use the hall for meetings and events.  When Lord de\u00a0Tabley's sister, Eleanor, Lady Leighton Warren (1841\u20131914) inherited the estate, she did not continue this custom.  Wishing for more privacy, she closed the park to public access, and greatly reduced the number of visitors to the old hall."]}]}}
