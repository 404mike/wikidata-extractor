He was educated at Monkton Combe School and at Cambridge University, and was a contemporary of fellow Olympic rower Michael Lapage at both places. He was bowman in the winning Cambridge boat in the 1947 Boat Race and took the same position with the record-breaking Cambridge crew in the 1948 race. In 1948, he was a crew member of the British boat which won the silver medal rowing at the 1948 Summer Olympics in the men's eights.Wartime service : Pilot Officer \"Paul\" Mellows served with the RAF during WW II as a night fighter pilot flying De Havilland Mosquitos accompanying planes from Bomber Command on 50 operations over mainland Europe. His DFC was awarded following a raid over Stuttgart, during which his plane sustained critical damage as a result of AAA fire, which almost completely destroyed the aircraft's tailplane. Despite the damage incurred which made manoeuvring the aircraft extremely difficult if not almost impossible, PO Mellows managed to limp the damaged aircraft and his navigator crewman across occupied territory and back to base in England, and for valour and the superb flying skill demonstrated that night, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\nMellows died at Addlestone, Surrey at the age of 75.\nHis Widow Jean Mellows survives him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Monkton Combe School", "response": ["* Pilot Officer Alfred Mellows DFC, 1922-1997, Olympic rower"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|  || Paul BircherJack DearloveMichael LapageBrian LloydPaul MasseyAlfred MellowsJohn MeyrickGuy Richardson || Rowing || Men's eight || ", "|align=left|Christopher BartonPaul BircherJack DearloveMichael LapageBrian LloydPaul MasseyAlfred MellowsJohn MeyrickGuy Richardson"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in rowing (men)", "response": ["|Christopher BartonMichael LapageGuy RichardsonPaul BircherPaul MasseyBrian LloydDavid MeyrickAlfred MellowsJack Dearlove"]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|Christopher BartonMichael LapageGuy RichardsonPaul BircherPaul MasseyBrian LloydJohn MeyrickAlfred MellowsJack Dearlove"]}, {"page": "Michael Lapage", "response": ["Lapage was born at Shaftesbury, Dorset, the son of Reginald H.
