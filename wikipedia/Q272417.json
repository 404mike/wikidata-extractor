This is most notable in talent-search programs such as Idol and The X Factor, which have spawned music stars in many of the countries in which they have aired. Many other shows, however, have made at least temporary celebrities out of their participants; some participants have then been able to parlay this fame into media and merchandising careers. Participants of non-talent-search programs who have had subsequent acting careers include Lilian Afegbai, Jacinda Barrett, Jamie Chung, Stephen Colletti, David Giuntoli, Vishal Karwal, NeNe Leakes and Angela Trimbur; though Barrett and Trimbur were already aspiring actresses when they appeared on reality television. Reality TV participants who have become television hosts and personalities include Nabilla Benattia, Rachel Campos-Duffy, Kristin Cavallari, Colby Donaldson, Raffaella Fico, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Katie Hopkins, Rebecca Jarvis, Jodie Marsh, Heidi Montag, Tiffany Pollard and Whitney Port; some of them have had acting careers as well. Reality TV participants who have become television personalities as well as successful entrepreneurs include Gemma Collins, Lauren Conrad, Jade Goody, Bethenny Frankel and Spencer Matthews. Several cast members of MTV's Jersey Shore have had lucrative endorsement deals, and in some cases their own product lines.

During his time in CBB4, he was the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow. He was booed on his entrance into the house. His participation in the show caused controversy, partially due to him being a sitting MP at the time of his entry into Big Brother - although, as the only MP of his party in the House of Commons, he did not take a whip. He consistently put a great deal of effort into the tasks assigned in the show, which included an incident, often re-shown, in which he pretended to be Rula Lenska's pet cat. Another task involving Galloway wearing a leotard also led to public derision by the British media. Galloway broadly aligned himself with Dennis Rodman and Pete Burns throughout the show. He referred to Jodie Marsh as a \"wicked person\" after she had an argument with Michael Barrymore, however he himself later had a heated altercation with Barrymore. He attacked Preston and Chantelle for their relationship, and though initially friendly with Rula Lenska, incurred her hostility upon the broadcast of his correspondence with Big Brother to the other housemates. Galloway said he was shocked at the lack of interest in politics from the younger housemates \u2013 particularly Chantelle, who referred to the House of Commons as \"the place with the green seats\" \u2013 he also said that he would be most famous housemate worldwide as he is known to every Muslim. On Day 17 the housemates decided that he could not nominate for continuous rule breaking. He was evicted on Day 21 with 65% of the vote.

Jodie was by far the most unpopular with her fellow housemates, she was involved in a series of arguments with George Galloway, Michael Barrymore and Pete Burns, she received eight nominations on Day 5, and was evicted on Day 9 with 42% of the vote. She cried during her interview with Davina, whilst she reflected on her time in the house. Jodie claimed on finale night that she would not be appearing on any more reality shows, however she has since appeared on her own reality show, Totally Jodie Marsh, and even had the wedding of her short-lived marriage broadcast on MTV.

After he claimed in the house that his coat was made of gorilla skin, police removed the coat from the house, without his knowledge or consent, for testing. Ownership of products made from gorilla is illegal in the United Kingdom without a licence. Tests found that the coat was in fact made of Colobus monkey, another endangered species. As a result, the case was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service who determined that the pelts used to make the coat were imported before 1975, when it became illegal to import Colobus fur, and as such will not be pressing charges. This greatly upset animal rights campaigners. Burns was known for his 'acid tongue' and his verbal tirades against Jodie Marsh and Traci Bingham. He finished in fifth place on the finale, receiving 13.6% of the vote. He received a hostile reception on his exit. He later appeared on more reality shows, and presented Big Brothers Big Mouth for a week in August 2007 during Big Brother 8. Burns appeared on Davina's final send off which aired on the last night of Ultimate Big Brother performing \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\".
