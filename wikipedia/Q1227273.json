Examples of rhyming slang include: tin lids or dustpan lids for kids; jimmy grant for emigrant; apple and pears for stairs; rubbidy dub for pub and trouble and strife for wife.Hotten, John Camden, A Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant and Vulgar Words, 2nd ed, London, 1860, pp 263\u2013269 The selection of rhyming words often suggested a symbolic association.
