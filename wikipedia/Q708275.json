He was especially attacked by Charles Tilstone Beke, who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to Kana. But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his assertion \u2014 hotly contested by Beke \u2014 that the Blue Nile was the main stream. The topographical results of his explorations were published in Paris between 1860 and 1873 in G\u00e9od\u00e9sie d'\u00c9thiopie, full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps. Of the G\u00e9ographie de l'\u00c9thiopie (Paris, 1890) only one volume was published. In Un Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de manuscrits \u00e9thiopiens (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian manuscripts collected by Antoine.His manuscripts and notebooks have been digitized by the National Library of France and are available on their web portal Gallica as \"Ethiopien d' Abbadie\" and \"Antoine d' Abbadie \u2013 Carnets\". He also compiled various vocabularies, including a Dictionnaire de la langue amari\u00f1\u00f1a (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the Shepherd of Hermas, with the Latin version, in 1860. He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions. Under the title of Reconnaissances magn\u00e9tiques he published in 1890 an account of the magnetic observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the Red Sea and the Levant. The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the title of Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie.Available on Gallica."]}, {"page": "Hormuzd Rassam", "response": ["However, about this time Charles Tilstone Beke, arrived at Massawa, and forwarded letters from the hostages' families to Tewodros asking for their release.

However, Rassam did have supporters, both in the press and especially in Government amongst both Liberal and Tory ministers.
