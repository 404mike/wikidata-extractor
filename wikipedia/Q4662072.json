In Farsley's first preseason match of the 2014\u201315 season, Priestley assisted on the game-winning goal of a 1\u20130 victory over Barnoldswick Town. In Farsley's next preseason match, Priestley scored a first-half brace in an eventual 4\u20130 victory over Glasshoughton Welfare. In the first match of the regular season, Farsley were defeated 3\u20130 by Lancaster City with Priestley coming on as a 53rd-minute substitute. Although his addition was noted as strengthening the attack and prompted several scoring chances, he was unable to add to Farsley's tally. Three days later, Priestley scored his first goal of the season, the game winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Ossett Town with only minutes remaining. Earlier in the match Priestley earned the penalty kick which was converted by Aaron Hardy for Farsley's first goal after Priestley was taken down in the box by the Ossett Town goalkeeper. To begin Farsley's 2014\u201315 FA Cup qualifying campaign, Priestley scored his club's fourth goal in a 4\u20131 victory over Athersley Recreation on 30 August 2014 after coming on as a 76th-minute substitute for Marcus Edwards. The victory propelled Farsley to their first FA Cup First Qualifying Round appearance in two years. Additionally, Priestley's goal came off his last touch before leaving to join the Gibraltar national team in Portugal for a Euro qualifying match against Poland. In Priestley's first two matches back with Farsley following Gibraltar's Euro qualifying match against Germany in November 2014, Priestley scored four goals in league two matches, including his first hat trick of the season on 22 November against Burscough. In January 2015 Priestley was once again offered a move away from Farsley by an unnamed club but rejected the offer stating, \"At this time I don't want to be playing anywhere else. I've had a good run in the team and the management have been supportive throughout. Hopefully I can repay everyone with continuing to score the goals to get Farsley where they want to be.\" Priestley ended the 2014\u20132015 season with 14 goals in 33 league appearances and 7 goals in 10 cup matches. Farsley went on to lose 2\u20133 on penalties to Warrington Town in the Doodson Sport Cup final. Priestley came on as a 65th-minute substitute in the match and netted his penalty kick to make it 2\u20132.
