The Merseysiders were awarded a penalty on the hour mark following a foul by Clive Goodyear on John Aldridge. However, Aldridge's penalty was saved by Beasant's diving save to his left, thus Beasant became the first keeper to save a penalty in a Wembley FA Cup final. The Londoners survived more pressure from Liverpool to secure their first major trophy and a notable upset in FA Cup Final history. Captain Dave Beasant became the second goalkeeper to lift the FA Cup as a result (Royal Engineers goalkeeper and captain Major William Merriman lifted the Cup in 1875). After the final whistle John Motson who was commentating for the BBC delivered his famous line: \"The Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club.\"", "|RB ||2 || Clive Goodyear"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["|RB ||2 || Clive Goodyear"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Wimbledon F.C. season", "response": ["Wimbledon continued to exceed expectations in the First Division, finishing in seventh in the final table, one place lower than their sixth place the previous season, but, considering that Wimbledon were one of the smallest clubs in the First Division, this was still a great achievement. However, Wimbledon's greatest success during the season, perhaps in their entire history, came in the FA Cup, defeating West Bromwich Albion (4\u20131, home), Mansfield Town (1-2, away), Newcastle United (1-3, away), Watford (2\u20131, home) and Luton Town (2-1, neutral) to reach their first ever FA Cup Final, against that season's champions Liverpool. Wimbledon took a lead in the 37th minute when Lawrie Sanchez scored a looping header from Dennis Wise's free kick on the left. Liverpool created many chances, but failed to pull a goal back, with Dave Beasant saving a penalty from John Aldridge after Clive Goodyear was (incorrectly) adjudged to have fouled inside the box; Beasant was the first goalkeeper to ever save a penalty in an FA Cup final at Wembley. Wimbledon held on to win their first (and only) FA Cup, in one of the most unexpected finals of all time. Due to the ban on English clubs competing in European competition as a result of the Heysel disaster, Wimbledon were denied the opportunity to compete in the Cup Winners' Cup."]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Clive Goodyear", "||| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Clive Goodyear", "| Clive Goodyear", "| Clive Goodyear"]}]}}
