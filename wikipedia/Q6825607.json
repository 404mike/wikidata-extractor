Banks had thought of pursuing classical music at a later stage in his career when he could dedicate more time to it. Five originated when Banks was commissioned to write a fifteen-minute piece for live performance at the Cheltenham Music Festival in July 2014, the seventieth instalment of the festival, by artistic director, Meurig Bowen. Banks chose a composition from a collection of short pieces that were in development at the time and worked on it further, which was then known as \"Arpregg\" but re-titled \"Prelude to a Million Years\" and became the opening track on Five. Banks spoke of the debut performance of the composition: \"The softer passages were fine, but the parts that required real oomph, like the big cello riffs, didn't work very well at all\"."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Bowen (tenor)", "response": ["Bowen was born in Llanelli in 1932.
