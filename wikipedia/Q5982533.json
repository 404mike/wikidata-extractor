However, ethnomusicology, especially in the earlier years of the field, was still primarily focused on non-western cultures; it is only in recent years that ethnomusicological scholarship involved more diversity with respect to both the cultures being studied and the methods by which these cultures may be studied. Ian Pace has discussed how questions regarding what exactly is within ethnomusicology's purview tend to be political rather than scholarly questions.Pace, Ian. 2006. \"My contribution to the debate 'Are we all ethnomusicologists now?'\" Presented at City University. pp. 1\u20139 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82963722.pdf He also states that biases become readily apparent when examining how ethnomusicologists approach Western vs non-Western music."]}, {"page": "Brian Ferneyhough", "response": ["His scores make huge technical demands on performers.

Ian Pace proposes that the influence of the group's clarinetist Armand Angster might be a reason for the prominence of the clarinet in much of Dusapin's music from this time period. Griffiths, too, makes note of the important role of the clarinet in the series of shorter pieces that Dusapin wrote after the completion of his first opera, Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (1985\u201389). Dusapin's tendency to write for specific instrumentalists (in this case, clarinetist Angster) reveal a practical and realistic side of the composer.", "According to Ian Pace, Dusapin's first opera, Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (1985\u201388) is the \"pivotal work\" in the composer's career, for it is in this work that he first \"properly\" combines his ideas of narrative to the theatrical realm.Pace, \"Never To be Naught\", 18. Pugin views Dusapin's opera as a return to the \"more fruitful\" style of Niob\u00e9, and cites Dusapin's vocal pieces Mimi (1986\u201387), Il-Li-Ko (1987), and Anacoluthe (1987) as study pieces for the creation of his first opera, particularly for the setting of the French language.

The moment that the pen takes possession of it, the thought loses its original form\". The implication is that all composition is a form of transcription, and in this light Finnissy's often very substantial diversions from the originals may be viewed as re-creations of the original 'abstract ideas' which prompted Verdi himself.Pace (2001), p. 3. The influence of Busoni can be felt throughout the Transcriptions in the form of quotations from or allusions to Busoni's own compositions; the pianist Ian Pace considers the work to be a 'Homage to Busoni'.Pace (2001), p. 6.", "The first two books of the Transcriptions were composed in the period 1972\u20131988 and revised in 1995.

Michael Oliver,  in International Record Review (April 2002), wrote that the composer matches \"Verdian imagery with pianistic and fundamentally modern ones: a limpid glitter evokes the Venetian lagoon of I due Foscari but tempests follow, and lightning staccato clusters, and sepulchral rumblings like a Kraken stirring beneath the Adriatic. Grace notes in an aria from Giovanna d\u2019Arco prompt poised and ornate lines of Finnissy\u2019s own\"; Oliver calls the Don Carlos transcription \"both a highly original response to Verdi and a magnificently pianistic sound.\" Arnold Whitall, in The Gramophone (April 2002) was more cautious: \"You could certainly argue that in its boldness, emotional intensity and love of display, Finnissy's music is truer to Verdi than any abject imitator of the Verdi style could ever be. On the other hand, pushing things to extremes was not the Verdian way either.\" BBC Music Magazine gave the recording a five-star rating.Reviews cited on Ian Pace website, accessed 21 March 2016"]}, {"page": "Theodor Schubach", "response": ["His works have been interpreted by the singers Lisa Fornhammar and Anna Palimina and the pianist Ian Pace, among others.
