In 1979, two women's colleges, Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's, reciprocated by admitting men as undergraduates, while St Hugh's, which was already employing male college lecturers, decided to admit men as Fellows. Resistance to full co-education was led by those who predicted that it would have severely negative effects on women academics and who saw other advantages in women\u2019s colleges. Admitting men as undergraduates was first proposed to the governing body in 1980, and there was a majority for it, but it did not secure the required two-thirds majority. The college principal, Rachel Trickett, fought off full co-education at St Hugh's for some years, even taking her case to the national newspapers, and it was not finally agreed until 1986.Laura Schwartz, A Serious Endeavour: Gender, Education and Community at St Hugh's, 1886-2011 (Profile Books, 2011),  pp. 114\u2013118 When Trickett retired in 1991, she was succeeded by the first male Principal, Derek Wood.Schwartz (2011), p. 22", "A new boathouse was constructed for the St Hugh's Boat Club (jointly with St Anne's and Wadham Colleges) between 1989 and 1990. This was followed by the construction of the Rachel Trickett Building between 1991 and 1992 at a cost of \u00a33.4 million.", "The main entrance of the college leads straight to the Main Building, which usually accommodates first year students, and also houses the chapel and the dining hall. Other first year students may be accommodated in the 1960s Kenyon Building, named for Dame Kathleen Kenyon. Second years live in either the Rachel Trickett Building, named after a past principal of the college, or the Mary Gray Allen Building. Wolfson Building consists of nine staircases. Finalists usually live in the newer Maplethorpe Building, whose rooms have en-suite facilities; clusters of eight rooms share a kitchen on each of the three floors, with four staircases altogether. All the rooms have views of gardens.", "|Rachel Trickett"]}, {"page": "John Llewellyn Rhys Prize", "response": ["|1953 || Rachel Trickett || The Return Home || "]}, {"page": "Trickett", "response": ["*Rachel Trickett (1923\u20131999), English novelist and academic"]}, {"page": "Michael Gearin-Tosh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rachel Trickett"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 1999", "response": ["*Rachel Trickett, 75, English novelist, non\u2011fiction writer and literary scholar."]}, {"page": "Grongar Hill", "response": ["Later still, Rachel Trickett exposed the \u201cinnate absurdity\u201d of the supposition \u201cthat the technique Dyer acquired as a painter could be reproduced with a kind of transliterated accuracy in language.\u201d Furthermore, it is a legitimate part of the poet's role to comment and \u201cDyer does in fact make a distinction between the visual and the perceptual by separating his passages of description and of moralizing\u201d.\u201dSome Aspects of Visual Description\u201d in Augustan Studies, University of Delaware 1985, pp.241\u20132"]}, {"page": "Jean Jones (artist)", "response": ["Jones\u2019s work was the subject of a 1980 solo exhibition at Oxford\u2019s Ashmolean Museum.
