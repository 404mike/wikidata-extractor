She was first elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Morley and Outwood in West Yorkshire at the 2015 general election, defeating Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls. She was an advocate for the Eurosceptic organisation Leave Means Leave. She was a strong critic of Theresa May during her leadership of the Conservative Party due to her handling of Brexit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Morley, West Yorkshire", "response": ["Historically, Morley was the centre of one of two divisions of the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley. Morley became a Municipal Borough in 1889 and under the Local Government Act 1972, was incorporated into the City of Leeds Metropolitan District. Morley is represented on Leeds City Council by three wards (namely Morley North, Morley South and Ardsley and Robin Hood) each with three councillors. At the 2010 general election, Morley and Outwood was won by Ed Balls of the Labour Party, who had been MP for Normanton since 2005, and served as Labour's Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2011 until 2015. Balls narrowly lost the seat at the 2015 general election to Conservative Andrea Jenkyns."]}, {"page": "University of Lincoln", "response": ["*Andrea Jenkyns \u2013 MP for Morley and Outwood"]}, {"page": "List of Open University people", "response": ["*Andrea Jenkyns, Conservative MP"]}, {"page": "Normanton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Local newspapers and the Labour Party opposed the initial change, but following a public consultation the Commission decided to create the seat conceding only a name change \u2013 from Pontefract and Castleford, to Normanton and Pontefract. This was extended to cover all three names. The wards of Wrenthorpe and Outwood West and Stanley and Outwood East \u2013 the most affluent parts of the constituency \u2013 were joined to the Conservative-leaning commuter town of Morley, which is in the Leeds district, as Morley and Outwood. Ossett and Horbury were moved to the Wakefield constituency. At the time local groups and newspapers protested that this represented a takeover of the Wakefield district by the Leeds district. Also, an early concern of the Labour Party was that Morley and Outwood would be won by the Conservatives in 2010, alas Ed Balls held the seat by just 1,101 votes, and ultimately lost the seat at the 2015 general election to the Conservatives' Andrea Jenkyns."]}]}}
