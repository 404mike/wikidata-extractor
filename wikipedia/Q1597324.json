A graduate of the University of G\u00f6ttingen, where he studied for his doctorate under the direction of James Franck, winner of the 1925 Nobel Prize for Physics, he left Germany after the Nazi Party came to power there in 1933, and moved to Britain, where relatives had settled, becoming a British subject in 1939. At the invitation of Frederick Alexander Lindemann, he worked for Imperial Chemical Industries at the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford, where he studied hyperfine structure. During the Second World War, he worked on isotope separation for Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project. He was the first physicist to become a fellow at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1950, and published textbooks on atomic spectra in German in 1934 and English in 1962.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wroc\u0142aw", "response": ["*Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn, physicist"]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn (1950)"]}, {"page": "List of University of G\u00f6ttingen people", "response": ["*Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn \u2014 Physics"]}, {"page": "Francis Simon", "response": ["In 1940 in collaboration with Nicholas Kurti and Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn, he was commissioned by the MAUD Committee to investigate the feasibility of separating uranium-235 by gaseous diffusion. He initially adapted his wife's wire kitchen strainer to assist in this work before commissioning a membrane from ICI containing 160,000 holes to the square inch. His resulting conclusions on the separation of uranium isotopes was transferred to the Manhattan Project and was the basis of the process that produced sufficient U235 to make the atomic bomb.Medawar & Pyke.
