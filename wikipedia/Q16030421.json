In 1884 he wrote to the Manchester-based Women's Suffrage Journal declaring his support for women's suffrage, writing that \"[t]here are no questions which receive so little attention, or which, in my opinion, so urgently call for the close and serious consideration of social reformers, as those affecting the condition of women.
