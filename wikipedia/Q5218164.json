By the early 1930s several general meetings lapsed for want of a quorum. In March 1934, a reconstruction committee was elected. The Irish community soon rallied to the support of the INA, and by the 1940s the association was entering its golden age. It was at this time that the second great figure came onto the Sydney Irish scene Dan Minogue. A native of County Clare, Dan Minogue came to Australia in the 1910s, and for over 30 years it was his vision which shaped the course of the INA.", "The first stage of Dan Minogue's vision for the INA, was to purchase land in Devonshire St, Surry Hills to establish a cultural centre for the Irish in Sydney. He and the Committee worked hard to raise the money to build the centre and in develop a cohesive Irish community to patronise it.", "The founders of the INA were mainly working people with few political contacts, but the INA of the 1940s was dominated by those successful in politics. Dan Minogue was an alderman on the Sydney City Council along with two other INA Executive members, Tony Doherty and Eric Drew. Dan Minogue was elected Federal member for the seat of West Sydney. Deputy federal leader of the Australian Labor Party, and one-time Prime Minister, Frank Forde, was also a member of the INA.", "In 1953, the existing terrace houses in Devonshire Street were demolished, and as well as the c\u00e9il\u00eds and other cultural events the first issue of the newspaper \"Sydney Gael\" was published. Other activities of the INA included an annual lecture at Sydney University, housie, Irish dancing, the pipe band, and the upkeep of the 1798 Memorial at Waverley Cemetery. Finally, in 1956, the INA Cultural Centre was completed with the help of a \u00a337,000 loan. There was a grand opening on 16 September by Dan Minogue in the presence of Albert Dryer, the Irish charg\u00e9 d'affaires and the mayor of Sydney, and a crowd of over two thousand.", "1963 saw the end of an era with the death of the INA's founder, Dr Albert Dryer on 11 April. The reduction in the number of Irish immigrants arriving in Australia and the inevitable personality clashes which had developed within the enclosed Irish community soon led to a decline in the INA's membership. One by one the national Feis, handball, card nights and other activities were discontinued. Dan Minogue, detecting the assimilation of the Irish community and the need to compete with mainstream entertainment venues for their patronage, pressed ahead with providing a licensed club for the Irish community. It was to be Dan Minogue's last mission in the Irish community, and he officially opened The Gaelic Club on the first floor of the INA building in 1974.", "4.
