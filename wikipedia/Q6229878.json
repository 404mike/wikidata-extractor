Soon there appeared a 10\u00a0hp twin with radiator tubes forming the sides of the hood; in 1904 the company introduced a range of front-radiatored Aster-engined cars. One of these was a 10\u00a0hp of 1985 cc; others were fours of 3054 cc, 3686 cc, and 4849 cc. All cars featured Govan's rather awkward gearbox, which had a T-shaped gate and separate reverse and change-speed levers. The company, by now named Argyll Motors Ltd. had now become Scotland's biggest marque and soon moved from its premises in Bridgeton, Glasgow to a grand, purpose-built factory in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire. The Argyll Motor Works covered , had its own railway line, and was opened in 1906 by John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. However, the new factory was never used to capacity, and the company began to decline after Govan's death in 1907. It went into liquidation in 1908."]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 19th century", "response": ["* John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu (1866\u20131929), automobile enthusiast and expert"]}, {"page": "Beaulieu Abbey", "response": ["The sound of Gregorian chant, considered an omen by local tradition, have been reported by Mrs Elizabeth Varley, daughter of John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, and Michael C.

By 1905, the company was expanding production rapidly, and a new site at Alexandria, outside the city, was identified. Plans were drawn up by architect Charles James Halley, and the building was officially opened by John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, on 26 June 1906. The factory covered , and was served by its own railway line and several streets of houses for the factory workers. The new facility cost over \u00a3200,000, and was designed to produce 2,500 cars per year. By 1907, production had passed 800 per year, but a series of technical experiments, and increasing competition, led to the company's decline. The high running costs of the huge factory, and the failure to adopt mass production, may also have contributed to the company's troubles. The final blow came in 1914 following a lawsuit brought by Daimler, which Argyll won, but the costs led to bankruptcy and production ceased."]}, {"page": "John Walter Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu"]}, {"page": "JWE Douglas-Scott-Montagu", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu"]}, {"page": "David Lindesay-Bethune, 15th Earl of Lindsay", "response": ["Lord Lindsay married the Honourable Mary-Clare Douglas-Scott-Montagu, daughter of John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu and Alice Pearl Crake, on 31 October 1953.
