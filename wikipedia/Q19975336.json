He was on the books of Manchester United before the First World War and of Tranmere Rovers during it but never played for either in the League. He also played in the Manchester League and Lancashire Combination for Hurst, in the Southern League for Norwich City, and in the North-Eastern League for Darlington before their election to the Football League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steven Saylor", "response": ["Saylor contributed autobiographical essays to three anthologies of gay writing edited by John Preston, Hometowns, A Member of the Family, and Friends and Lovers, and prior to his novel-writing career he published gay erotic fiction under the pen name Aaron Travis.", ";Erotic fiction under the pseudonym Aaron TravisThe complete works published under the Aaron Travis pen name were reissued in Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Nook editions in 2012."]}, {"page": "Dick Healey (footballer)", "response": ["His goals also helped Darlington reach the second round proper (last 32) of the 1919\u201320 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth qualifying round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5\u20130. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put the ball in the net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead\u00a0\u2013 the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4\u20130."]}, {"page": "Percy Sutcliffe", "response": ["Together with Norwich teammate Billy Ingham, Sutcliffe signed professional terms with North-Eastern League club Darlington ahead of the 1914\u201315 season; the pair linked up again with Aaron Travis, with whom both had played at Norwich and who had joined Darlington some months earlier. He helped them reach the first round proper of the 1914\u201315 FA Cup, in which they faced Bradford City of the First Division. Although Darlington paid Bradford too much respect, the Yorkshire Post picked out Sutcliffe and Eddie Hanlon as \"effective spoilers of their opponents' tactics\"."]}]}}
