In the next match, he performed even better: he took 45 minutes to score his first run but then made 35 and shared a 118-run sixth-wicket partnership with his captain, Maurice Tremlett, before finishing off a victory for Somerset with three of the last four Nottinghamshire wickets. Those bowling figures of three for 44 were to remain his best, however. \nIn 1960, he played five games without bettering his personal batting or bowling bests. The following year, he was given an extended run on the Somerset side, playing in 10 of the first 12 first-class matches. He was used almost entirely as a batsman, bowling just seven overs and failing to take a wicket. In 18 innings, two of them not out, he made only 199 runs at an average of 12.43. This included his highest score of 41, made against Middlesex at Taunton. He left Somerset at the end of the season, and did not play first-class cricket again.\nMiles Lawrence returned to Yorkshire where he was associated with his father's indoor cricket schools business and coached at Leeds Grammar School. In Yorkshire league cricket, he became a wicketkeeper. He died just four months after his father, aged 48.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 16", "response": ["*  1989   \u2013 Miles Lawrence, English cricketer (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Miles Lawrence (1959\u20131961) 18 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Hurricane Fausto (2002)", "response": ["Deep convection around the eyewall began to diminish, and Fausto then weakened to a Category 3 hurricane. After quickly dropping in strength to a Category\u00a02 hurricane, Fausto weakened at nearly the same rate as it had intensified. Although Fausto held steady as a Category\u00a02 hurricane for 18 hours, it then began to rapidly weaken back into a Category 1 hurricane, then a tropical storm six hours later early on August\u00a026. Upon weakening into a tropical storm, Forecaster Miles Lawrence at NHC noted \"...there is no longer any deep convection associated with its circulation...\", although Fausto still remained a tropical cyclone. On August\u00a027, the NHC issued its final advisory on Fausto, although not for dissipation, but rather that the storm crossed 140\u02daW, and had entered the area of responsibility for the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). While post-storm analysis from the CPHC indicated that Fausto was a tropical storm upon emerging into the CPHC's area of responsibility (AOR), the storm was operationally classified as a tropical depression upon entering the AOR. With no deep convection remaining, the CPHC downgraded Fausto into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC August\u00a028. Fausto degenerated into a remnant low while located over 800\u00a0mi (1287\u00a0km) north of Hilo, Hawaii on August\u00a028 at 1200 UTC."]}, {"page": "Johnny Lawrence", "response": ["Lawrence's son, Miles Lawrence, also a right-handed batsman and leg-break bowler, played 18 first-class matches for Somerset between 1959 and 1961.
