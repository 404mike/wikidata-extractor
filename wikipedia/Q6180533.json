In March 2007 he was taken on trial by Yeovil Town, and the Somerset club signed him permanently for the 2007\u201308 season. At Yeovil, however,  he was restricted to just one appearance in the Football League, and was eventually loaned out to Worthing before being released at the end of the season. He was subsequently signed by Andy Hessenthaler, manager of Dover Athletic, after a successful trial. However, after travelling issues took their toll, Hughes left Dover by mutual consent in December 2009.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hughes (surname)", "response": ["*Jerahl Hughes (born 1989), English footballer"]}]}}
