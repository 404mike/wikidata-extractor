Her singing teacher in Milan was Adelaide Saraceni, who had been  one of the stars of the Toscanini seasons at La Scala in the 1930s.  Therefore, Helen's training is linked directly to the great Italian bel canto tradition.\nShe divided her career with equal success between the operatic stage and the concert platform and was an accomplished recitalist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Helen Lawrence", "response": ["Helen Lawrence may refer to:", "*Helen Lawrence (actress) in Murder in Harlem", "*Helen Lawrence (opera singer) ", "*Helen Lawrence (triathlete), see 2005 ITU Triathlon World Championships", "*Helen Lawrence, character in Helen's Babies (film)", "*Helen Lawrence, a play by Vancouver artist Stan Douglas"]}]}}
