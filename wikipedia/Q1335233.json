This conception presupposes a pre-existing matter or substratum out of which the earth was made. In Philippine mythologies, struggle between two hostile forces is a common theme in the formation of the earth (hence, the existence of the Land Breeze) which is always subsequently followed by the creation or appearance of the first man and woman in contrast to the animals that precedes it.Demetrio, Francisco (1968). Asian Folklore Studies Vol. 27, No. 1 (1968), pp. 41-79 (39 pages). Nanzan University. Page 43. According to Andres San Nicolas (1624) the Sambal people (An ethnic group closely related to the Tagalogs particularly those in Tanay, Rizal) \"did not doubt the fact of there having been in its time a creation of man, but they believed that the first one had emerged from a bamboo joint and his wife out of another, under very ridiculous and stupid circumstances.\"Blair, Emma Helen & Robertson, James Alexander (1973). The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898. Cachos Hermanos, 1973. Page 140. According to William Marsden (1784) the ancient Tagalogs believed that the first man and woman were produced from a bamboo, which burst in the island of Sumatra; and they quarreled about their marriage. A paper by Catalina Villaruz written about 1920 and now in the H. Otley Beyer manuscript collection reports that the Southern Luzon Tagalog believed that the first man started his life inside a bamboo pole. He grew, the bamboo cracked, and out he came. The same story is told of the first woman, and once out of the cane they looked at each other, fell in love, and married. A Tagalog euphemism for a child born out of wedlock is \"putok sa buho\" (\"one who burst out of a bamboo\") \u2013 an evident carryover from the times when the myth was held as gospel of truth.Roces, Alfredo R. (1977). Filipino Heritage: The stone age in the Philippines. Lahing Pilipino Pub. ; [Manila], 1977. Page 81. According to Nick Joaquin [Alamanac for Manile\u00f1o (1979)] \"The man wooed the woman but the woman was shy, illusive, and stubbornly coy. Becoming impatient, God [i.e. Bathala] started violent earthquake, which flung the woman into the man\u2019s arm. Only thus were they married and the earth populated\".Joaquin, Nick (1979). Alamanac for Manile\u00f1o. Mr and Ms Publications, 1979.

Chapter XV, page 107. Based on the version of creation myth provided by William Marsden (1784), the ancient Tagalogs viewed the \"earthquake\" as a\u00a0manifestation of Bathala Maykapal. However, Pedro Chirino in his writings did not speak of the \"earthquake\" nor does he believe that it is considered as God, because according to the Tagalogs and the Mandayas of Mindanao who informed him: the \"earthquake\" is nothing more than the effect of the movements of a huge animal in the entrails of the earth which according to some, an alligator; others, a boar who scratches his body against the trunk of the earth; which is also the belief of the mountain people of Palawan and Camarines.

Ancient Beliefs and Customs of the Tagalogs. Lulu.com, 2018. , 9780244348731. Page 45. Some of the documented old Tagalog curses includes: Kainin ka nang buaya! (May a crocodile eat you!) and Lamunin ka nang lindol! (May the earthquake swallow you up!).MacKinlay, William Egbert Wheeler (1905). A Handbook and Grammar of the Tagalog Language. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1905. Page 105. The low-frequency vibrations produced by male crocodiles just before bellowing, which could vibrate the ground and result in the water's appearing to \"dance\", is more likely where the ancient Tagalogs get the idea of the origin of earthquake. In modern Tagalog mythology, the earthquake is caused by a messianic figure named Bernardo Carpio, the King of the Tagalogs, who was trapped between the boulders in the mountains of Montalban.Potet, Jean-Paul G. (2018). Ancient Beliefs and Customs of the Tagalogs. Lulu.com, 2018. , 9780244348731. Page 36-37. In contrast to the gigantic subterranean crocodile, the ancient Tagalogs also believed in the existence of a gigantic celestial bird which makes its nest in the clouds.University of Manila (1958). University of Manila Journal of East Asiatic Studies, Volume 7-8. Page 144. It is not clear, however, whether this bird is identified to the primordial kite/glede that initiates the series of events which leads to the creation of the world and humankind. According to Colin, the Tagalogs believed that the first man and woman sprang from a bamboo pecked by a bird called by them Tigmamanokin and to which they applied the name of their god Bathala.University of Manila (1959).

However, John Crawfurd, later First Resident of Singapore, said in 1820 that Martina was not a princess, but a Portuguese woman from Siam, and Steuart points out that there is no evidence that Trapaud knew Light when the couple began living together. Other contemporary accounts name her as the daughter of the 19th Sultan of Kedah (Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II), by a lower-ranking wife of mixed Thai-Portuguese ancestry.

His intention was to provide education for the children of local leaders in the new British colony of Singapore as well as the company's employees and others who wished to learn the local languages. Another objective was to \"collect the scattered literature and traditions of the country\" so that the most important may be published and circulated. Raffles referred to the plan as his \"last public act\"; by setting up the Institution, he hoped it that it could, through its generations of alumni, serve as \"the means of civilising and bettering the conditions of millions\" beyond Singapore. Those involved in the plan for the Institution included Reverend Robert Morrison, Sophia Raffles, William Farquhar, and William Marsden. It was initially suggested that the Institution should merge with the Anglo-Chinese College founded by Morrison in Malacca, but this plan did not materialise.  Raffles contributed $2,000, secured a grant of $4,000 from the British East India Company and, together with subscriptions from other individuals, raised funds totalling $17,495 for the project.
