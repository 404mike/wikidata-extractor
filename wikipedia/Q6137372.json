The subject of his dissertation was \"Incantations against the demoness Lama\u0161tu\" (Beschw\u00f6rungen gegen die D\u00e4monin Lama\u0161tu). From May 1949 on, K\u00f6cher first worked as a research assistant and later, beginning in October 1952, as a research associate at the Institute for Oriental Studies (Institut f\u00fcr Orientforschung) of the Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin. Due to the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, he was forced to abandon his work, since he lived in West Berlin and the Akademie was in the east. Because of his relentless work in the years prior to these events, K\u00f6cher had already laid the foundations of his afore mentioned magnum opus. His talent for making hand copies of cuneiform tables quickly became apparent when he assisted Erich Ebeling with his volume \"Literarische Keilschrifttexte aus Assur\" in 1953. K\u00f6cher was introduced to cuneiform medicine through, among others, the work on Ebeling's \"Keilschrifttexte zur assyrisch-babylonischen Drogen- und Pflanzenheilkunde\" in 1955, which was mostly focused on the pharmacological series URU AN.NA. He kept working on the series even long after his retirement.James Kinnier Wilson: The Assyrian Pharmaceutical Series URU.AN.NA : MA\u0160TAKAL. In: Journal of Near Eastern Studies Vol. 64, No.1 (January 2005), pp. 45-52"]}]}}
