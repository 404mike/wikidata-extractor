Milan of the 1990s and Juventus from the 2010s onwards being in the spotlight. Rob Bagchi wrote in British newspaper The Guardian: \"Italy has also produced defenders with a surplus of ability, composure and intelligence. For every Gentile there was an Alessandro Nesta.\" Critics and foreign footballers who have played in the Serie A have described Italian defenders as being \"masters of the dark arts\" motivated by a Machiavellian philosophy of winning a game at all costs by cunning and calculating methods. Historian John Foot summed up the mentality: \"...the tactics are a combination of subtlety and brutality. [...] The 'tactical foul' is a way of life for Italian defenders\"."]}, {"page": "Paul Foot (journalist)", "response": ["Paul Foot was married twice, to Monica (n\u00e9e Beckinsale, 1962\u201370) and Rose (Roseanne, n\u00e9e Harvey, 1971\u201393) and had a long-term relationship with Clare Fermont.

It was part biography and part fiction. The author has admitted that details about Kilpin life were so scarce that he could not complete a full biography. The same year, a team from LeftLion began filming a documentary about Herbert Kilpin's life in both the UK and Italy. The film features commentary from Robert Nieri, Luigi La Rocca, Mark Hateley, Luther Blissett, Daniele Massaro, Giovanni Lodetti, John Foot and many others. The film was shown at cinemas and film festivals across Europe in 2017 and 2018 and eventually released online and on DVD in January 2019.
