A 2\u20130 win at Layer Road against rivals Colchester United was particularly sweet, with defender David Titterton scoring his one and only Wycombe goal. O'Neill strengthened the squad with the signing of midfielder Steve Brown from Northampton Town for \u00a360,000 and Nicky Reid, a free transfer from West Bromwich Albion. A 3\u20132 aggregate defeat in the Southern area final of the Associate Members Cup denied the Blues a trip to Wembley but everyone hoped a Wembley visit wouldn't be needed with automatic promotion still a realistic target. It came down a crunch game with Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. Ashley Ward gave the railwaymen a first-minute lead but a bizarre own goal from Darren Rowbotham soon pulled the Wanderers level. However, Ward snatched a winner 14 minutes from time and they jumped above the Blues into the automatic promotion places. A 1\u20131 draw with Preston North End on the final day of the season wasn't enough and the club had to settle for the play-offs. Martin O'Neill knew the disappointment would be huge but fortunately a trip Wembley Arena for the London Standard 5-a-sides provided the perfect tonic, as perennial substitute goalkeeper Chuck Moussadik performed heroics and was voted man of the tournament as Wimbledon were beaten on sudden death penalties in the final.", "The semi-final saw the Wanderers travel up to in-form Carlisle United for the first leg and put in one of their best performances of the season. Steve Thompson gave the visitors a priceless lead on the half hour and with five minutes to go Simon Garner raced away to seal a 2\u20130 win. Within seven minutes of the second leg at Adams Park Dave Carroll had headed home and another trip to Wembley was confirmed when Simon Garner slid the ball past Tony Caig early in the second half. The Cumbrians grabbed a consolation from the penalty spot with Wycombe winning 4\u20131 on aggregate. The final at Wembley was against Preston North End and almost 20,000 Wycombe fans made the journey to the home of football. Goalkeeper Paul Hyde played despite having been sick all week, and Wycombe dominated the first half, but despite Steve Thompson equalising immediately after Ian Bryson had given North End the lead, they took a 2\u20131 advantage into the break through Paul Raynor. Within two minutes of the restart Simon Garner showed great control taking a long pass from David Titterton before firing unerringly past Woods. Ten minutes later an immaculate one-touch four-man passing move cut the Preston defence asunder and Dave Carroll passed the ball into the back of the net to give Wanderers the lead for the first time. A 4\u20132 win was sealed with 17 minutes to go when Carroll went on a trademark jinking run before cutting back on the edge of the area and smashing in a shot off the post. It still ranks as arguably the greatest ever Wycombe Wanderers performance and Martin O'Neill had led his team to another promotion, for the second year running."]}, {"page": "Titterton", "response": ["*David Titterton (born 1971), British former professional footballer"]}, {"page": "Titterton, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Titterton"]}, {"page": "1994 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Wycombe Wanderers faced Carlisle United in the second semi-final; the first leg took place at Brunton Park in Carlisle on 15 May 1994.
