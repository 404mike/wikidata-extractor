He was a civil servant until 1999, serving in the Home Office, Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office. His last civil service appointment was as Head of the Constitution Secretariat.  \nIn the Northern Ireland Office from 1988 to 1998, he led the team which first met Sinn F\u00e9in following the 1994 cease fire. He led the team supporting Ministers in the 1996-98 roundtable talks, chaired by United States Senator George Mitchell, which culminated in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1994 and was knighted in 1999 for \"services to peace in Northern Ireland\".In the Home Office he was Head of the Broadcasting Department (1984 to 1988), with responsibility for advising on the development of broadcasting policy, including cable and satellite broadcasting, and on relations between government and the broadcasting authorities and other regulatory bodies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Criticism of the BBC", "response": ["After the 2004 report, the BBC appointed a committee chosen by the Governors and referred to by the BBC as an \"independent panel report\" to write a report for publication, which was completed in 2006. Chaired by the British Board of Film Classification president, Sir Quentin Thomas, the committee found that \"apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias\" in the BBC's reporting of the Middle East. However, its coverage had been \"inconsistent\", \"not always providing a complete picture\" and \"misleading\", and the BBC had failed to report adequately the hardships of Palestinians living under the occupation. Reflecting concerns from all sides of the conflict, the committee highlighted certain identifiable shortcomings and made four recommendations, including the provision of a stronger editorial \"guiding hand\"."]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Quentin Thomas (born 1944), British civil servant"]}, {"page": "British Board of Film Classification", "response": ["The BBFC's attitude became more liberal during the 1960s, and it concentrated on censoring films that featured graphic sex and violence. However, some Board decisions caused controversy in the 1970s when it banned a series of films that were released uncut and were popular in other countries (such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Last House on the Left), or released other controversial films, such as Straw Dogs and A Clockwork Orange. However, under recent presidents Andreas Whittam Smith and Sir Quentin Thomas, guidelines were relaxed again, allowing the release, usually uncut, of these previously banned films on video and in cinemas. Some films from the 1970s remain unreleased. However, many of these titles remain banned primarily because their distributors have not chosen to re-submit the films to the BBFC, almost certainly for commercial reasons; if re-submitted, they would be likely to receive a more sympathetic hearing than 30 to 40 years ago. Two notable examples from this period include the 1969 film Love Camp 7, rejected in 2002, and Women in Cellblock 9, released in 1977 and rejected in 2004. Both films contain substantial scenes of sexual violence and have remained completely banned following a re-submission since 2000.", "* Sir Quentin Thomas (1 August 2002 \u2013 17 October 2012)"]}, {"page": "Sir Quentin Thomas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Quentin Thomas"]}, {"page": "The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)", "response": ["In October 2011, the BBFC ultimately granted the film an 18 certificate for \"very strong bloody violence and gore, and sexual violence\" after 32 compulsory cuts were made, totalling 2 minutes and 37 seconds. Sir Quentin Thomas, president of the BBFC, stated:When we first examined this work earlier this year we judged that, as submitted, it was unsuitable for classification; and, as we explained to the company, we could not ourselves see how cuts could produce a viable and classifiable work. That remains the view of one of our Vice Presidents, Gerard Lemos, who is therefore abstaining from the Board's collective decision. The company lodged an appeal against our decision to refuse classification. In the course of preparations for that appeal, the company proposed a number of cuts which it was right for us to consider. In response, after further examination, we proposed a more extensive series of cuts. These cuts produce a work which many will find difficult but which I believe can properly be classified at the adult level. The company has now accepted these cuts, withdrawn its appeal and the work has been classified, as cut, at 18.The sales director of Eureka Entertainment supported the decision, stating:We are really pleased that after nearly four months of detailed discussion and debate, we have been able to reach an agreement with the BBFC and to produce a very viable cut of the film which will both excite and challenge its fans. Naturally we have a slight disappointment that we have had to make cuts, but we feel that the storyline has not been compromised and the level of horror has been sustained."]}, {"page": "Quentin Thomas (civil servant)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Quentin Thomas"]}, {"page": "1994 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Quentin Thomas, Grade 2, Northern Ireland Office."]}]}}
