Born of Hope, for instance, drew on \"a couple of paragraphs\" by Tolkien in an appendix on the Tale of Aragorn and Arwen, added its own original characters, ties its story in to other elements of Middle-earth, and references Jackson's film treatment with its choice of rugged filming locations, Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of Aragorn by casting the similar-looking Christopher Dane as Aragorn's father Arathorn, and by making the Orcs monstrous and ragged in visibly Jacksonian style. It further alludes to Jackson's trilogy, Alberto writes, with techniques such as \"accelerated exposition\" and an unseen narrator of \"ancient story\" speaking over \"sweeping location shots, battle scenes, and details from a character's life\". Reid comments that The Hunt for Gollum fills a gap in the story left by Jackson's decision to omit the hunt; the fan film, she writes, knowledgeably follows Tolkien's story, having Aragorn capture Gollum and hand him over to the Elves, before going further with its own narrative."]}]}}
