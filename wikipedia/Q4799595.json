Lyttelton had the benefit of experience as a senior tutor at Keble College, Oxford. He came from a well-established family with strong connections in both the Church and State, his mother being the sister-in-law of the prime minister, William Gladstone, who was to become a major benefactor of the college. Lyttelton was himself a life-long supporter of the Liberal party and was familiar with many politicians in Westminster, his wife Kathleen, a women's activist, being the daughter of the Liberal MP George Clive. Lyttelton persuaded Gladstone to make a personal gift to the college of the louder of the two chapel bells. Gladstone reportedly believed that Cambridge students needed to be well woken if they were to get up at a productive time in the morning. Today, the chapel bell is affectionately known as 'Gladstone's Bell' by students."]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 19th century", "response": ["* Arthur Lyttelton (1852\u20131903), Master of Selwyn College, Cambridge, 1882\u20131893"]}, {"page": "Alfred Lyttelton", "response": ["Lyttelton was the twelfth and youngest child of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, by his first wife Mary, daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, 8th Baronet.
