He also set up a website of his own, Manxman.com, on which he posted satirical comments about Manx politics. He instituted Manxman's Black Pages as a place where people unhappy about Manx issues could ventilate their concerns. The website's postings about a property development planned by Albert Gubay, the multi-millionaire founder of the Kwik Save supermarket chain, provoked Gubay into suing Drower for libel. Gubay obtained an order unprecedented in Manx legal history which required the searching of Drower's home and the seizure of his computers, and also banned him from discussing the case with anyone \u2013 even his wife \u2013 apart from his lawyers. Despite Gubay's efforts to have him imprisoned, Drower refused to name the source who, he said, had supplied him with the information upon which his allegations against Gubay were based. Because the Isle of Man had no statute that allowed journalists a privileged right to keep the identity of their informants secret, Judge Michael Kerruish found Drower guilty of contempt of court, fined him \u00a32,500 and ordered him to contribute towards Gubay's legal costs."]}]}}
