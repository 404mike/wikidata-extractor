Her mother was Ann Christiana Burn, the sister of John Southerden Burn and daughter of a Royal Marines captain. Edmunds had a privileged upbringing and was privately educated, but was diagnosed with hysteria in her early twenties. It was while she was living with her widowed mother in Brighton, in the late 1860s, that Edmunds became involved with the local doctor, Charles Beard. The nature of their relationship remains a source of controversy but, in September 1870, Edmunds poisoned Dr Beard's wife by giving her a poisoned chocolate cream. However, Mrs Beard recovered from the resulting violent illness. Dr Beard said later that he suspected Edmunds had poisoned his wife at that time, but did not act on his suspicion, due to a lack of proof and a concern over the taint of scandal.Kaye Jones, 'The Case of the Chocolate Cream Killer: The Poisonous Passion of Christiana Edmunds, (Barnsley, Pen & Sword, 2016)."]}, {"page": "William Edmunds", "response": ["William Edmunds may refer to: ", "*William Edmunds (architect) (1801\u20131847), English architect", "*William Edmunds (actor) (1886\u20131981), stage and screen character actor"]}, {"page": "List of Commissioners' churches in eastern England", "response": ["|William Edmunds", "|William Edmunds"]}, {"page": "Margate Lighthouse", "response": ["This lighthouse was designed by the architect William Edmunds and was completed in 1829.
