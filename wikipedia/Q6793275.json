M. Larkin (1932 \u2013 2004) was an English historian specialising in the history of modern France. Between 1976 and 1999 he held the Richard Pares Chair of History at Edinburgh University.

Joanna Richardson found it \"solid and imaginative\", Maurice Larkin described it as \"stimulating and unpretentious\" and John Horne praised its \"admirable subtlety\". For G. M. Hamburg the book had captured Vichy France in all of its complexity: \"Kedward\u2019s study of French idealism and opportunism gives a more complicated, but a more accurate picture of the motivations behind the resistance than is available in other histories\". Critics particularly enjoyed Kedward's linking of the history of the distant and recent past. M. R. D. Foot underlined that: \"Mr Kedward\u2019s great advantage when he writes about politics is that he understands history. One of his book\u2019s main virtues is that he shows how much people of southern France in those years of defeat and despair were conscious of, and sustained by, the knowledge of previous national catastrophes and of the traditional remedies for them.\" ", "This view was reiterated by an anonymous reviewer in The Economist: \"he thoroughly understands French history, and is able to show how people in a country in difficulties can come to terms with their present by reflecting on their past\". This same reviewer was full of praise for the book's methodology finding in Kedward: \"an exemplar to scholars of how to treat almost intractable material\". Using oral history had given considerable vitality to the study in the eyes of the Times Higher Education Supplement, \"Kedward brings the period alive as a result of his many interviews with former r\u00e9sistants\". Kedward had attempted to allow different voices to emerge but for Maurice Larkin he had been a little bit over-indulgent in accepting the Communist party's stance: \"He tries very hard to be fair to everyone \u2013 perhaps, some may think, a little too benignly in his account of communist behaviour in 1940\u201341\"."]}, {"page": "Albert-L\u00e9on-Marie Le Nordez", "response": ["Le Nordez was born in Montebourg.

Joseph Reinach, pioneer historian of the Affair, believed in a Jesuit conspiracy against the Republic in which du Lac was implicated.Albert S. Lindemann, The Jew Accused: Three Anti-Semitic Affairs (Dreyfus, Beilis, Frank), 1894-1915 (1991), p. 121.
