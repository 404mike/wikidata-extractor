Members of the Argentine garrison had salvaged a crippled BAS launch, which was used to download the cargo.B\u00f3veda, pp. 105\u2013106 and 122 Some hours later, after leaving Grytviken, Santa Fe was detected on radar by Lieutenant Chris Parry, the observer of the Westland Wessex HAS.3 anti-submarine helicopter from Antrim, and attacked with depth charges. This attack caused extensive internal damage, including the splitting of a ballast tank, the dismounting of electrical components and shocks to the machinery. As the submarine struggled to return to Grytviken on the surface, Plymouth launched a Westland Wasp HAS.1 helicopter, and Brilliant launched a Westland Lynx HAS.2. The Lynx dropped a Mk\u00a046 torpedo, which failed to strike home, but strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted 7.62\u00a0mm L7 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). The Wessex also fired on Santa Fe with its GPMG. The Wasp from HMS Plymouth and two other Wasps launched from Endurance fired AS-12 air-to-surface anti-ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. Santa Fes men and the marines onshore attempted to fight off the attack by firing their rifles, machine guns, and an old Bantam anti-tank missile at the aircraft, but the Argentine boat was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging or even from sailing away. The crew abandoned the listing submarine at Grytviken pier on South Georgia and surrendered, along with the Argentine garrison, to the British forces.B\u00f3veda, pp. 110\u2013123 Brilliants diving officer, Lt. Chris Sherman, went down to place a charge to disable the submarine further, and blew off its rudder."]}, {"page": "Fortuna Glacier", "response": ["When Argentina militarily occupied the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, the British Armed Forces recaptured the island in 'Operation Paraquet', thereby removing the Argentinian military presence and restoring the island to British Sovereignty. It was decided to land a mountain troop of Special Air Service and 42 Royal Marine Commandos on the glacier, to approach Grytviken from the most unlikely direction. After the troops were landed on the glacier in conditions of extremely poor visibility and gale extreme force winds on 21 April, their conditions deteriorated rapidly still further.  During several repeated rescue attempts the following day by a Wessex 3 (Antrim) and two Wessex V (Tidespring) helicopters, the Wessex V aircraft crashed in extreme weather conditions.  The Wessex 3, crewed by Lt Cdr Ian Stanley, Lt Chris Parry, Sub Lt Stewart Cooper and PO ACMN David Fitzgerald, succeeded in rescuing all troops and aircrew in an amazing feat of flying and navigation just before dark.  On returning to Antrim, the Wessex 3 (which can be seen at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Somerset) held 16 personnel instead of its normal 4 capacity."]}, {"page": "Operation Paraquet", "response": ["The Argentinian submarine successfully landed her reinforcements at Grytviken, under moonless cloud cover in the pre-dawn hours of 25 April, and was underway by 0500. Antrim\u2032s aircrew, which included Lieutenant Chris Parry, anticipated that Santa Fe would unload her troops under the cover of darkness and would withdraw at first light through Cumberland Bay without submerging, due to the threat of icebergs. They suggested re-fitting their Wessex with radar, which had been removed to transport the SAS, and intercept Santa Fe as she left the bay. Captain Young thus brought his three warships some 25 miles north-east of Cumberland bay and prepared his helicopter force for anti-submarine action. He now had at his disposal, besides Antrim Wessex, three Wasps (one aboard Plymouth and two on Endurance) and two Lynxes (aboard Brilliant). At 0855, the submarine was located by Antrim's Wessex using radar and engaged with depth charges. One charge bounced off the boat's deck but the other exploded alongside, rupturing the port ballast tank and piercing an external fuel tank. Now unable to dive, Bicain was forced to reverse course towards Grytviken."]}, {"page": "Chris Parry", "response": ["Chris Parry may refer to:", "*Chris Parry (lighting designer) (1952\u20132007), theatrical lighting designer", "*Chris Parry (Royal Navy officer)", "*Chris Parry (producer) (born 1949), founder of Fiction Records"]}, {"page": "Chris Parry (Rear Admiral)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Parry (Royal Navy officer)"]}, {"page": "Effect of Brexit on Gibraltar", "response": ["In April 2017, the former director of operational capability at the UK Ministry of Defence, Rear Admiral Chris Parry, said, \u201cWe could cripple Spain in the medium term and I think the Americans would probably support us too\" if it came to war over Gibraltar, though he did not believe that war was likely."]}, {"page": "Fish for finance", "response": ["In mid-December 2020, the UK had four of the vessels on standby to protect its waters. The Royal Navy has always routinely enforced both UK and European fishing laws throughout the year. Tobias Ellwood, chair of the Defence Select Committee in the Commons, disagreed with any potential threat of increased use of the navy, saying \"We're just facing the prospect of ... our overstretched Royal Navy squaring up to a close NATO ally over fishing vessel rights,\". \"Our adversaries must be really enjoying this.\" While the vessels are armed, they would not be expected to fire on EU fishing boats; in extreme cases, if one refused to leave British waters, the naval vessels would run alongside and board them, then take the confiscated ship to the nearest British port. Chris Parry, a former admiral and MMO chair, advocated for doing just that to set an example. \"Once you had impounded them, the others would not be so keen to transgress without insurance.\""]}]}}
