He posthumously became famous for the song \"Mexican Flyer\", which was originally released on the Ken Woodman and his Picadilly Brass album That's Nice in 1966. \"Mexican Flyer\" was used as the theme song for Space Channel 5, and was included in the soundtrack of Samba de Amigo and Swing Girls.\nHe was also music arranger for Shirley Bassey, Tom Jones and famously for Sandie Shaw, where he arranged and conducted \"Puppet on a String\" at the Eurovision Song Contest.\nKenny Woodman was a musician in the Royal Marine Band, during WW2 and arranged a lot of their music in the early 1950s before moving into the music business.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Space Channel 5", "response": ["The game was conceived by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who was told to create something aimed at a female audience. Production lasted two years, with a staff of around 20 that included company veterans and newcomers to game development. The music, composed by Naofumi Hataya and Kenichi Tokoi, drew inspiration from big band music. Ken Woodman's \"Mexican Flyer\" had informed the musical style and acted as the theme song. The overall style was influenced by culture from the 1950s and 1960s, and the later music videos of Peter Gabriel and Michael Jackson, the latter having a cameo appearance in the game.", "The game's main theme was \"Mexican Flyer\", composed by Ken Woodman in 1966. Mizuguchi approached Woodman about using the theme. Woodman was surprised that someone wanted to use the theme for a video game. The use of \"Mexican Flyer\" in the game's early presentation video informed the direction of the music. Getting the rights to the track proved difficult, as the track was extremely obscure and had not been used in any media since its release. A soundtrack album for the game was published by Marvelous Entertainment and distributed by VAP on February 21, 2000. The album featured 22 tracks, including a remix of \"Mexican Flyer\"."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Young (broadcaster)", "response": ["He developed a popular approach to current affairs and regularly interviewed Margaret Thatcher while she was Prime Minister.

Taylor also disclosed to Shaw that, despite Taylor being the manager of both Sandie Shaw and Adam Faith, Adam Faith had been taking a percentage of most of Shaw's earnings and had an interest in most of the publishing rights to her songs.

The song was written for Sandie Shaw by Les Reed and Gordon Mills, and was rejected by Eve Taylor, based on hearing the demo version, as sung by Tom Jones.
