However, Glamorgan chose not to enforce the follow-on and elected for more batting practice. By close of play they were 134 for no loss. On the third and final day, Mark Wallace and Jonathan Hughes both completed their centuries, making 117 and 109 (retired hurt) respectively. Glamorgan eventually declared on 381 for 3 after 28 third-day overs, leaving Cardiff UCCE an impossible 833 to win \u2013 before Andrew Davies nipped out a wicket after five minutes. After Simon Jones got another, and Cardiff UCCE were 57 for 2, Rhodri Lloyd and Simon Butler got together for three hours, until the end of the match. When Lloyd was out for 102, Butler was on 104, and the game ended in a draw.", "Amid rains at Southampton, Hampshire batted their way to the big lead they were expected to get against Glamorgan, who had lost four games in the Championship before this. Former England batsman John Crawley took a day for his century, while in contrast Kevin Pietersen took two and a half hours for his, making a century off 99 balls and ending with 126. Hampshire eventually made 401 for 8 declared to get full batting points before attacking Glamorgan. Chris Tremlett reaped Glamorgan wickets in the next innings, removing David Hemp, Mike Powell and Jonathan Hughes among others to take four for 42 and reduce Glamorgan to 229 \u2013 a score that would have been much lower but for Darren Thomas, who blitzed his way to 63. Following on, Glamorgan got to 77 for 1 at stumps on day three, but wickets tumbled in the morning, reducing Glamorgan to 147 for 5. Robert Croft and Mike Powell rebuilt, but when Australian batsman Simon Katich had Croft caught by skipper Shane Warne and Powell went a few overs later, Glamorgan ended on a total of 250 as Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine picked up the last three wickets, finishing with five for 60, while Tremlett took three for 48. In reply, Hampshire reached the target of 79 inside fifteen overs, with Katich \u2013 unusually \u2013 opening the batting.

After the first day was shortened by rain, Glamorgan got into their stride on the second day, Dan Cherry taking seven hours to make 226 runs \u2013 while Middlesex' best bowling figures came from Melvyn Betts, taking one for 80. Glamorgan declared on 584 for 3, and Middlesex replied in fashion, declaring on 435 for 4 in an attempt to get a result \u2013 Ed Joyce scoring 155. Three quick wickets from Alan Richardson gave Middlesex some hope of forcing Glamorgan out, but a 118-ball 84 not out from Sourav Ganguly and Jonathan Hughes' second century of the match resulted in Glamorgan setting a target of 408 in 82 overs \u2013 a rate similar to that required in a one-day cricket. However, more centuries awaited, as Ed Smith and Owais Shah took Middlesex to 380 for 1 (admittedly with Ben Hutton retired hurt), and Irishman Ed Joyce made 70 not out to see Middlesex to the target.", "However, Hemp was worn out after his marathon knock, and was sent in at five as Glamorgan followed on.
