From 1948 it came under the control of the National Health Service and along with other local hospitals was run by Dundee General Hospitals Board of Management.   It eventually expanded to cover all of the site formerly occupied by the East Poorhouse. As a result, it became Dundee's second main hospital. From the late 1940s a number of senior doctors were transferred from Dundee Royal Infirmary to Maryfield to develop the hospital, including Jean Herring, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Margaret Fairlie, who became consultant in charge of the Gynaecology Department in 1949. A new geriatric unit was opened at the hospital by Princess Margaret in 1957. Maryfield was also the site of a pioneering general hospital psychiatric unit, under the medical direction of Sir Ivor Batchelor.

The deed stated that the college should promote \"the education of persons of both sexes and the study of Science, Literature and the Fine Arts\". Mary Ann Baxter's insistence on the education of women meant that the college's alumni include the social reformer Mary Lily Walker and Scotland's first female professor, Margaret Fairlie. As a philanthropist, together with her sister Eleanor and her brother Sir David, Mary Ann Baxter also founded Baxter Park, buying 37 acres of fields in 1861 and commissioning designer Sir Joseph Paxton to design a park \"with the view of affording to the working population the means of relaxation and enjoyment after their hard labour and honest industry\"."]}, {"page": "Emma Ritter-Bondy", "response": ["Little is known about Ritter-Bondy due to the limited number of files at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
