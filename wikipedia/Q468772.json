She achieved fame and recognition very early in her career, being admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1770, at the age of twenty-six.Despite the low status that still life painting had at this time, Vallayer-Coster\u2019s highly developed skills, especially in the depiction of flowers, soon generated a great deal of attention from collectors and other artists. Her \u201cprecocious talent and the rave reviews\u201d earned her the attention of the court, where Marie Antoinette took a particular interest in Vallayer-Coster's paintings.Her life was determinedly private, dignified and hard-working. She survived the bloodshed of the Reign of Terror, but the fall of the French monarchy, who were her primary patrons, caused her reputation to decline.\nIn addition to still lifes, she painted portraits and genre paintings, but because of the restrictions placed on women at the time her success at figure painting was limited.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Still life", "response": ["The bulk of Anne Vallayer-Coster's work was devoted to the language of still life as it had been developed in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.Michel 1960, p. i During these centuries, the genre of still life was placed lowest on the hierarchical ladder. Vallayer-Coster had a way about her paintings that resulted in their attractiveness. It was the \"bold, decorative lines of her compositions, the richness of her colours and simulated textures, and the feats of illusionism she achieved in depicting wide variety of objects, both natural and artificial\" which drew in the attention of the Royal Acad\u00e9mie and the numerous collectors who purchased her paintings. This interaction between art and nature was quite common in Dutch, Flemish and French still lifes. Her work reveals the clear influence of Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, as well as 17th-century Dutch masters, whose work has been far more highly valued, but what made Vallayer-Coster's style stand out against the other still-life painters was her unique way of coalescing representational illusionism with decorative compositional structures.Berman 2003", "File:Attributes of Music.jpg|Anne Vallayer-Coster, The Attributes of Music (c. 1770)", "File:Still Life with Lobster.jpg|Anne Vallayer-Coster, Still Life With Lobster (c. 1781)", "File:Attributes of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture.jpg|Anne Vallayer-Coster, The Attributes of Painting (c. 1769)", "* Michel, Marianne Roland. \"Tapestries on Designs by Anne Vallayer-Coster.\" The Burlington Magazine 102: 692 (November 1960): i\u2013ii"]}, {"page": "Coster", "response": ["* Anne Vallayer-Coster (1744-1818), French painter"]}, {"page": "List of French artists", "response": ["*Anne Vallayer-Coster (1744\u20131818), painter"]}, {"page": "1770 in art", "response": ["* Anne Vallayer-Coster is admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture at the age of twenty-six.

He was one of the foremost portrait painters of his time, widely known for his masterful ability to reproduce his sitters' fashionable garments with their silks, lace, pearls and gold filaments. Roslin's ability to capture the personality of the people he depicted made him popular with his clients and allows us, even today a few hundred years later, to still feel close to the people he painted. He flattered and beautified his subjects according to the Rococo ideal. Roslin's portrait of Anne Vallayer-Coster is praised particularly and became much debated after the Salon. In Le V\u00e9ridique au Salon, published in 1783, it was described as one that \"belonged to the artist's best\". The picture has been compared to the contemporary artist Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun's celebrated self-portrait. Roslin depicted his model in a cool colour scale; in green, white, and blue, with the artist's attributes of palette and brushes, a common way for artists to depict themselves. Because of this, Roslin's painting was sometimes misinterpreted by art historians as a self-portrait by Vallayer-Coster.", "File:The artist Anne Vallayer-Coster.jpg|Anne Vallayer-Coster, French painter, 1783"]}, {"page": "1744 in art", "response": ["* December 21 \u2013 Anne Vallayer-Coster, French painter (died 1818)"]}, {"page": "Anne vallayer-coster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Vallayer-Coster "]}, {"page": "Marguerite G\u00e9rard", "response": ["G\u00e9rard was a well-known painter during her lifetime.

Her art was advertised with the phrase \"sous les yeux de Fragonard\" (under the eyes of Fragonard) to give her early work credibility. This has caused many art historians to overestimate Fragonard's role in her art. By her mid-20s, G\u00e9rard had developed her signature style, which featured painstakingly accurate details rendered with subtly blended brush strokes. It is currently accepted that G\u00e9rard made the five etchings in 1778 by herself based on Fragonard's drawings.  After the Revolution, once the Salons began accepting art created by women, G\u00e9rard exhibited from 1799 to 1824. Despite her lack of formal training, she won three medals for her artwork. One of her paintings, The Clemency of Napoleon, was purchased by Emperor Napoleon in 1808. Other patrons include Louis XVIII and various members of the upper class. Wealthy collectors purchased original paintings to display in their homes, while engravings of her paintings were spread among the middle class."]}, {"page": "Anne Vallayer Coster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Vallayer-Coster"]}, {"page": "Anne vallayer coster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Vallayer-Coster"]}, {"page": "Museum of Fine Arts, Reims", "response": ["**18th century - Fran\u00e7ois Desportes, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Anne Vallayer-Coster, Jacques-Louis David"]}, {"page": "Women in France", "response": ["Particularly noteworthy French women painters during the late 18th century include Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard, Anne Vallayer-Coster, and Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun. Vallayer-Coster was prominent for her figural paintings of King Louis XV's daughters and his daughter-in-law Queen Marie Antoinette. Antoinette and the Mesdames de France, also helped Labille-Guiard and Vig\u00e9e Le Brun obtain admission to the Acad\u00e9mie which caused a huge stir among the press, who decided to pit them as rivals against each other. The French Revolution of 1789 created a hostile environment for artists at the time, particularly those supported by the royal family. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun and Vallayer-Coster, along with many other female artists, fled to other parts of Europe and Russia. Labille-Guiard, however, chose to stay and built a respectable reputation painting the faces of the Revolution.

Two Riders on the Beach was subsequently auctioned at Sotheby's, London in June 2015, where it fetched the unexpectedly high price of almost 1.9 million pounds; Playing the Piano took longer to be returned to Hinrichsen's descendants as the family tree was more complex and there were more legal issues to be overcome, but was eventually restituted in 2021 and consigned to the auction house Christie's, by whom it is expected to be sold. In 2017, it was announced that the Camille Pissarro painting La Seine vue du Pont-Neuf, au fond le Louvre, found in Gurlitt's Salzburg house had been restituted to the heirs of Max Heilbronn, a Paris businessman from whom it had been confiscated in 1942, and that a drawing by Adolph von Menzel Interior of a Gothic Church had been returned to the descendants of Elsa Helene Cohen. In October 2017 it was announced that the painting Portrait of a Seated Woman by Thomas Couture had been identified as a looted work and would be returned to the descendants of the original owner, Jewish French politician Georges Mandel (the actual return taking place in January 2019), and in September 2018 four drawings by the artists Charles-Dominique-Joseph Eisen, Augustin de Saint-Aubin and Anne Vallayer-Coster that were among items previously sold by Benita Gurlitt were identified as originally stolen and would also be returned by their new owner.
