She achieved fame and recognition very early in her career, being admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture in 1770, at the age of twenty-six.Despite the low status that still life painting had at this time, Vallayer-Coster\u2019s highly developed skills, especially in the depiction of flowers, soon generated a great deal of attention from collectors and other artists. Her \u201cprecocious talent and the rave reviews\u201d earned her the attention of the court, where Marie Antoinette took a particular interest in Vallayer-Coster's paintings.Her life was determinedly private, dignified and hard-working. She survived the bloodshed of the Reign of Terror, but the fall of the French monarchy, who were her primary patrons, caused her reputation to decline.\nIn addition to still lifes, she painted portraits and genre paintings, but because of the restrictions placed on women at the time her success at figure painting was limited.", "link_mentions": {}}}
