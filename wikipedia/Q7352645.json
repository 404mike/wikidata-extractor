He worked for the aero engine division of Rolls-Royce from 1954 to 1960.He contested the Derby North constituency at the 1959 general election.  When the MP for Tiverton, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, was elevated to the peerage in 1960, Maxwell-Hyslop was elected as his successor at the resulting by-election, and retained the seat until he retired at the 1992 general election. His successor was Angela Browning.\nMaxwell-Hyslop was the longest-serving member ever of the Commons Select Committee on Trade and Industry, from 1971 to 1992. (The select committee structure was altered in 1979, with Maxwell-Hyslop continuing to serve on the committee in its new form.) He was also the last Conservative MP to ask Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher a question at PMQ's.\nHe was knighted in the 1992 New Year Honours. In 1968, he had married Joanna Margaret, daughter of Thomas McCosh, of Pitcon, Dalry, North Ayrshire; they had two daughters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)", "response": ["In 1971, having had early warning that Horace King would be retiring, the Conservatives took the lead in offering to the Labour Party either Selwyn Lloyd or John Boyd-Carpenter as potential speakers. The Labour Party chose Selwyn Lloyd, partly because he was perceived as a weak figure. However, when the House of Commons debated the new speaker, Conservative MP Robin Maxwell-Hyslop and Labour MP Willie Hamilton nominated Geoffrey de Freitas, a senior and respected backbench Labour MP. De Freitas was taken aback by the sudden nomination and urged the House not to support him (a genuine feeling, unlike the feigned reluctance which all speakers traditionally show). Lloyd was elected, but there was a feeling among all parties that the system of election needed to be overhauled. A candidate's consent is now required before they can be nominated."]}, {"page": "Angela Browning", "response": ["Browning contested Crewe and Nantwich at the 1987 general election, but was narrowly defeated by the veteran Labour MP Gwyneth Dunwoody by just 1,092 votes.
