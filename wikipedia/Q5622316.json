Author Jeffrey T. Richelson mentions Hinsley's estimate of at least two years, and concludes that \"It might be more accurate to say that Ultra helped shorten the war by three months \u2013 the interval between the actual end of the war in Europe and the time the United States would have been able to drop an atomic bomb on Hamburg or Berlin \u2013 and might have shortened the war by as much as two years had the U.S. atomic bomb program been unsuccessful.\"  Military historian Guy Hartcup analyzes aspects of the question but then simply says, \"It is impossible to calculate in terms of months or years how much Ultra shortened the war.\""]}, {"page": "First World War glass\u2013rubber exchange", "response": ["There are differing opinions on whether the physical exchange ever occurred.  Adam Hochschild claims in his 2011 work To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914\u20131918 that 32,000 pairs of binoculars were exchanged in the first month of the agreement (August 1915) but that no records survived of any subsequent shipments or the supply of rubber. Alan Simmonds states in his 2013 work  Britain and World War One that 30,000 pairs of binoculars were supplied by the end of 1915; historian Guy Hartcup came to the same conclusion after analysis of British archive material.  However, John L. Heilbron, in his 2003 work Ernest Rutherford: And the Explosion of Atoms, and Stewart Wills writing in the Optics & Photonics journal in 2016, claim that no exchange was made."]}]}}
