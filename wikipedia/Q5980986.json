The injuries restricted him to just nine starts in the 2005\u20136 season as Forest struggled. In 2006-7 Cullip began as an integral part of Colin Calderwood's three man defence (alongside Ian Breckin and Wes Morgan) and started Forest's first eight games (during which the side only conceded two goals \u2013 one of which to Cullip's former side Brighton) \u2013 however against Yeovil Cullip picked up yet another injury and was substituted after 23 minutes."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Nottingham Forest F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|6||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Ian Breckin (c)"]}]}}
