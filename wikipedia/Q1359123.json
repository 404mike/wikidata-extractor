He was a pioneer in the field of secular religious studies. In 1967 he established the first department of religious studies in the United Kingdom at the new University of Lancaster where he was also Pro-Vice-Chancellor, having already chaired one of the largest and most prestigious departments of theology in Britain at the University of Birmingham. In 1976, he became the first J.F. Rowny Professor in the Comparative Study of Religions at University of California, Santa Barbara. Smart presented the Gifford Lectures in 1979\u201380. In 1996, he was named the Academic Senate's Research Professor, the highest professorial rank at UC Santa Barbara. In 2000, he was elected President of the American Academy of Religion, while simultaneously retaining his status as President of the Inter Religious Federation for World Peace. Smart held both titles at the time of his death.\nSmart became widely known outside the Academy, at least in Britain, when he was editorial consultant for the major BBC television series, The Long Search (1977). His book The World's Religions (1989) also reached a considerable popular readership. His defence of religious studies as a secular discipline helped the formation of departments in many public universities, especially in the United States. He distanced religious studies from traditional theology in that evaluating truth claims and apology have no role but regarded investigation into the \"truth and worth\" of religion per se as a valid academic enterprise in the public arena of state-funded education.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philosophy of religion", "response": ["Another debate on this topic is whether all religious cultures share common core mystical experiences (Perennialism) or whether these experiences are in some way socially and culturally constructed (Constructivism or Contextualism). According to Walter Stace all cultures share mystical experiences of oneness with the external world, as well as introverted \"Pure Conscious Events\" which is empty of all concepts, thoughts, qualities, etc. except pure consciousness. Similarly Ninian Smart argued that monistic experiences were universal. Perennialists tend to distinguish between the experience itself, and its post experience interpretation to make sense of the different views in world religions.", "In the modern Western study of religion, the work of Ninian Smart has also been instrumental in representing a more diverse understanding of religion and religious pluralism.

The scholar of religion Brian Bocking stressed that, especially when dealing with periods before the Meiji era, the term Shinto should \"be approached with caution\". Inoue Nobutaka stated that \"Shinto cannot be considered as a single religious system that existed from the ancient to the modern period\", while the historian Kuroda Toshio noted that \"before modern times Shinto did not exist as an independent religion\"."]}, {"page": "Epicureanism", "response": ["Parallels may be drawn to Jainism and Buddhism, which similarly emphasize a lack of divine interference and aspects of its atomism.

The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations. Cambridge University Press. 1989. pp. 10\u201321.

In the Pali scriptures, for example, Buddha links the positive aspect of conscience to a pure heart and a calm, well-directed mind. It is regarded as a spiritual power, and one of the \"Guardians of the World\". The Buddha also associated conscience with compassion for those who must endure cravings and suffering in the world until right conduct culminates in right mindfulness and right contemplation.Ninian Smart. The Religious Experience of Mankind. Fontana. 1971 p. 118. Santideva (685\u2013763 CE) wrote in the Bodhicaryavatara (which he composed and delivered in the great northern Indian Buddhist university of Nalanda) of the spiritual importance of perfecting virtues such as generosity, forbearance and training the awareness to be like a \"block of wood\" when attracted by vices such as pride or lust; so one can continue advancing towards right understanding in meditative absorption.Santideva.

To Luther, conscience falls within the ethical, rather than the religious, sphere. John Calvin saw conscience as a battleground: \"the enemies who rise up in our conscience against his Kingdom and hinder his decrees prove that God's throne is not firmly established therein\".Calvin, Institutes of the Christian religion, Book 2, chapter 8, quoted in: Many Christians regard following one's conscience as important as, or even more important than, obeying human authority.Ninian Smart. The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 376 A Christian view of conscience might be: \"God gave us our conscience so we would know when we break His Law; the guilt we feel when we do something wrong tells us that we need to repent.\"Ninian Smart. The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 364 This can sometimes (as with the conflict between William Tyndale and Thomas More over the translation of the Bible into English) lead to moral quandaries: \"Do I unreservedly obey my Church/priest/military/political leader or do I follow my own inner feeling of right and wrong as instructed by prayer and a personal reading of scripture?\"Brian Moynahan. William Tyndale: If God Spare My Life. Abacus. London. 2003 pp. 249\u201350 Some contemporary Christian churches and religious groups hold the moral teachings of the Ten Commandments or of Jesus as the highest authority in any situation, regardless of the extent to which it involves responsibilities in law.Ninian Smart. The World's Religions: Old Traditions and Modern Transformations. Cambridge University Press. 1989. p. 353 In the Gospel of John (7:53\u20138:11) (King James Version) Jesus challenges those accusing a woman of adultery stating: \"'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.' And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one\" [However the word 'conscience' is not in the original New Testament Greek, and is not in the vast majority of Bible versions.] (see Jesus and the woman taken in adultery). In the Gospel of Luke (10: 25\u201337) Jesus tells the story of how a despised and heretical Samaritan (see Parable of the Good Samaritan) who (out of compassion/pity - the word 'conscience' is not used) helps an injured stranger beside a road, qualifies better for eternal life by loving his neighbor, than a priest who passes by on the other side.Guthrie D, Motyer JA, Stibbs AM, Wiseman DLJ (eds). New Bible Commentary 3rd ed. Inter-Varsity Press, Leicester. 1989. p. 905.", "Judaism arguably does not require uncompromising obedience to religious authority; the case has been made that throughout Jewish history rabbis have circumvented laws they found unconscionable, such as capital punishment.Harold H Schulweis. Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey. Jewish Lights Publishing. 2008. Similarly, although an occupation with national destiny has been central to the Jewish faith (see Zionism) many scholars (including Moses Mendelssohn) stated that conscience as a personal revelation of scriptural truth was an important adjunct to the Talmudic tradition.Ninian Smart. The Religious Experience of Mankind. Collins. NY. 1969 pp. 395\u2013400.Levi Meier (Ed.) Conscience and Autonomy within Judaism: A Special Issue of the Journal of Psychology and Judaism. Springer-Verlag. New York . The concept of inner light in the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers is associated with conscience. Freemasonry describes itself as providing an adjunct to religion and key symbols found in a Freemason Lodge are the square and compasses explained as providing lessons that Masons should \"square their actions by the square of conscience\", learn to \"circumscribe their desires and keep their passions within due bounds toward all mankind.\" The historian Manning Clark viewed conscience as one of the comforters that religion placed between man and death but also a crucial part of the quest for grace encouraged by the Book of Job and the Book of Ecclesiastes, leading us to be paradoxically closest to the truth when we suspect that what matters most in life (\"being there when everyone suddenly understands what it has all been for\") can never happen.Manning Clark. The Quest for Grace. Penguin Books, Ringwood. 1991 p. 220. Leo Tolstoy, after a decade studying the issue (1877\u20131887), held that the only power capable of resisting the evil associated with materialism and the drive for social power of religious institutions, was the capacity of humans to reach an individual spiritual truth through reason and conscience.Aylmer Maude. Introduction to Leo Tolstoy. On Life and Essays on Religion (A Maude trans) Oxford University Press. London. 1950 (repr) pxv. Many prominent religious works about conscience also have a significant philosophical component: examples are the works of Al-Ghazali, Avicenna,Nader El-Bizri. \"Avicenna's De Anima between Aristotle and Husserl\" in Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka (ed) The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming.

The English word implies internal awareness of a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as a consciousness of our own actions.Little, W, Fowler HW, Coulson J, Onions CT. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles. 3rd ed. Vol 1 Clarendon Pres. Oxford. 1992. pp. 402\u201303. Thus conscience considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined \"gut feeling\" or \"vague sense of guilt\" about what ought to be or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination, which may or may not be presently consciously acceptable to the person (\"traditional conscience\").Peter Singer. Practical Ethics. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1993 pp. 292\u201395. Conscience may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation (\"critical conscience\").Peter Singer. Democracy and Disobedience. Clarendon Press. Oxford. 1973. p. 94 In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others, critical conscience can be aided by a \"spark\" of intuitive insight or revelation (called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy).Ninian Smart.

In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives.  In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies.  In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them.
