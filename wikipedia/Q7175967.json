He was the last student to submit his thesis under Strachey before Strachey's death.\nIn 1978, Mosses published his compiler-compiler, the Semantic Implementation System (SIS), which uses a denotational semantics description of the input language.Mosses has spent most of his career at BRICS in Denmark. He returned to a chair at Swansea University, Wales. His main contribution has been in the area of formal program semantics. In particular, with David Watt he developed action semantics, a combination of denotational, operational and algebraic semantics.\nCurrently, Mosses is a visitor at TU Delft, working with the Programming Languages Group.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Compiler-compiler", "response": ["Some experimental compiler-compilers take as input a formal description of programming language semantics, typically using denotational semantics.
