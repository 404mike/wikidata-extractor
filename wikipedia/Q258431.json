It identifies itself differently from other detective dramas often by featuring a mixture of lighthearted whimsy and dark humour, as well as a notable soundtrack that includes the use of the theremin instrument for the show's theme tune.", "Anthony Horowitz and the original producers, Betty Willingale and Brian True-May, created the series.

And her theatrics ring true. But familiarity, in her case, does not quite equal originality. A middling cozy, then, that needs a few inspired jolts.\" Elaine Kendall, a book critic of the Los Angeles Times expressed: \"As a satire on amateur theater and the idiosyncratic types who invade it, \u201cDeath of a Hollow Man\u201d is often amusing, faltering only when author Caroline Graham reaches for the archly dated style of Allingham, Christie or Marsh. Using Tim and Avery for campy comic relief also seems a tad passe.\""]}, {"page": "Death in Disguise", "response": ["Death in Disguise is a crime novel written by English writer Caroline Graham and first published by Headline in 1992.
