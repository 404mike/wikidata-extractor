He later represented Wiltshire in the Minor Counties and played List A cricket for both Wiltshire and for Minor Counties representative sides.\nBorn at Bloemhof in Transvaal on 29 April 1937, Barwell was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper. Towards the end of his first-class career, when he played for Somerset's second eleven, he also bowled with some success.\nBarwell played first for Somerset in 1959 in a match against the Combined Services, keeping wicket and making the only stumping of his first-class career. Unable to play County Championship cricket until 1961 as he qualified for the county by residence, his appearances were in any case restricted in some seasons by his career as a schoolmaster. But even in those seasons when he was more regularly available, he often found himself a fringe first-team player, never making more than 11 first-class appearances in any one season and managing a highest season aggregate of just 410 runs, which he achieved in 1967.His best score was an unbeaten and quick 84 against Glamorgan at Weston-super-Mare in 1965. He also made 74 not out against the Pakistanis in 1967, though he was much upstaged by a second wicket partnership of 262 between Roy Virgin and Mervyn Kitchen, who made 162 and 189 respectively. He appeared in Somerset's losing Gillette Cup side of 1967, being run out for 24 in what Wisden termed \"a fearful mix-up\" with Graham Burgess. After starting the 1968 season as a regular member of the side, he dropped out after a few games and did not regain his place.\nIn second eleven cricket, Barwell was a reliable and prolific scorer, acting as batsman, occasional wicketkeeper, sometime captain and, more rarely, bowler. His final match for the combined Gloucestershire and Somerset Second Eleven side in 1968 saw him make 45 out of 54 added while he was at the wicket in a first innings that totalled only 78, top-score in the second innings with 68 and then take four wickets for 14 runs as the combined side recovered to force a draw with Kent's second eleven.After leaving Somerset, he played for Wiltshire, appearing in first-round Gillette Cup matches against Hampshire in both 1972 and 1973, and also turning out for the Minor Counties representative side in the Benson and Hedges Cup. In 1973, he made a single final first-class cricket appearance for the Minor Counties side against the West Indies at Torquay.As a schoolmaster, he taught at Dr Morgan's School, Bridgwater, Marlborough College and at Blundell's School.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blundell's School", "response": ["*Terry Barwell, cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Terry Barwell (1959\u20131968) 43 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Barwell (surname)", "response": ["* Terry Barwell (born 1937), South African cricketer"]}, {"page": "1967 Gillette Cup Final", "response": ["In Somerset's batting innings, Woodcock suggested that the team needed just one top-class performance to grant them victory after restricting Kent's score well late in their innings. Peter Robinson, opening with Roy Virgin, played well to score 48 runs, but that was the highest score that any Somerset player would manage. Each of the other top-order batsmen made starts, but none could convert them to big scores; Virgin got 17, Mervyn Kitchen 15 and Terry Barwell 24. Alley, identified by The Times as a key player for Somerset before the match, only scored one run before being caught behind square on the legside by Brown from the bowling of Shepherd. Graham Burgess provided some runs in the middle-order, but lacked support from his batting partners; of the five batsmen who were below him in the batting order, only Geoff Clayton added more than two runs to the score, and he only totalled eight. Derek Underwood finished as Kent's leading wicket-taker in the match, though his three wickets came late in the innings, as he had been held back against the top-order, as Cowdrey was concerned he might concede too many runs. Somerset were all out for 161 runs, with 54.5 overs bowled, giving Kent a 32-run victory.", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Terry Barwell b Roy Palmer || 1", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Terry Barwell "]}, {"page": "List of Minor Counties South List A players", "response": ["*Terry Barwell (1972): TI Barwell"]}]}}
