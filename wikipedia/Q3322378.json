In 1955, the British writer Montagu Slater\u2014a socialist sympathetic to Kenyatta's plight\u2014released The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta, a book which raised the profile of the case. In 1958, Rawson Macharia, the key witness in the state's prosecution of Kenyatta, signed an affidavit swearing that his evidence against Kenyatta had been false; this was widely publicised.
