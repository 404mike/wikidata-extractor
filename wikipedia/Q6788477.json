The band took their name from an episode of radio comedy programme The Goon Show. The band are unusual for using two bass-players in their line-up: Alex Griffin plays melody lines high up on one bass, and Matt Cheslin plays the regular bass lines on the other. This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums.The band was formed at sixth-form college and they recorded their first album while some members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd-surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990). In 2009, Jonn Penney stated, \"We're still adding designs - old habits die hard\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ned's Atomic Dustbin", "response": ["Ned's Atomic Dustbin are an English rock band formed in Stourbridge, West Midlands, in November 1987.

When asked about performing together for the first time in over a decade, Penney stated, \"It just felt right! There was the understandable awkwardness when we stood in a room together for the first time in 13 years, but that just melted away as soon as we started to play the songs.\" \"We didn't really know what was going to happen once we got playing on stage, because it had been such a long time since we'd all been in it together. It's different from rehearsal. It was such an incredible kind of electric feeling atmosphere for everybody. You felt at one with the crowd again, similar to very early on, when everybody was excited about what was happening.\" Matt Cheslin says, \"It was great, it's been quite nostalgic. I haven't played for the whole time that I haven't been in the band, but some of the really old songs I remember more. You do really notice the difference in the really early songs. It was as exciting as it was when I was 17.\""]}, {"page": "God Fodder", "response": ["God Fodder is the debut studio album by English rock band Ned's Atomic Dustbin, released on 1 April 1991 by Columbia Records. After creating their own imprint following the success of several prior independent singles, the band recorded the album from December 1990 to January 1991 in London. Musically, God Fodder takes large influence from grebo, shoegaze, noise pop, and dance music, characterized by noisy guitars, complex drum beats, and its usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing regular bass lines and Alex Griffin playing harmonic bass lines. Lyrically, the album features communal efforts written by all the band.", "God Fodder combines grebo music, a \"punk-influenced, electronica-informed, hyper, light-hearted rock\" genre with which the band were associated, with shoegaze music, a genre which forms the album's \"prevailing beat\". The album was described as a \"blend of frenzied, melodic rock, with the occasional touch of quirkiness\", such as the band's usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing \"normal basslines\" whilst Alex Griffin \"scratching out harmonic riffs.\" Besides the twin bass work, the album also features complicated drum beats and distorted guitars throughout. Trouser Press said the album combines catchy melodies, \"pulsing adrenaline beats\" and \"a wool-covered wall of fuzzy pop noise on which able singer Jonn Penney pastes challenging personal lyrics.\""]}, {"page": "Are You Normal?", "response": ["* Matt Cheslin -  Bass"]}]}}
