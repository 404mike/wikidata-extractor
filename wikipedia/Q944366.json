Born in Bristol, Hill started his career with Bristol City where he made over 200 appearances. He subsequently joined Preston North End where he also spent a successful spell, playing over 100 times for the Lancashire club. A move to Wolverhampton Wanderers followed but first team opportunities were more limited and he was loaned to Queens Park Rangers before leaving to join Barnsley. After only one season at the South Yorkshire club he transferred to Blackpool but again played few first team games before being loaned to Sheffield United, with the move being made permanent in the summer of 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol City F.C.", "response": ["|2001\u201302|| Matt Hill||Defender"]}, {"page": "Cole Skuse", "response": ["After signing a new deal at City in summer 2009, Skuse scored his first goal of the 2009\u201310 season in a 1\u20131 home draw with Peterborough. Skuse's second of the campaign, and sixth for Bristol City, came away at Leicester City, to help his team to a 3\u20131 victory. He wound up making a career-high 43 appearances in the league, and started every match bar one after September, playing alongside Marvin Elliott in midfield. Skuse was voted the club's player of the season for the 2009\u201310 season, as well as young player of the year. At the time, only Matt Hill had won both awards in the same season. After the season, new manager Steve Coppell offered Skuse a new extended contract until 2013, which he signed. He also started all four cup games for the club that season, including an FA Cup third-round replay defeat to rivals Cardiff City. Skuse has not played in multiple matches in either cup competition in a single season since."]}, {"page": "Preston North End F.C.

The club reached the Football League Trophy final for a second time, this time held at the Millennium Stadium, and Bell played 85 minutes of the 2\u20130 victory over Carlisle United; he was substituted for Matt Hill, as Louis Carey had started the match in Hill's place. He played 30 games in 2003\u201304, but did not feature in the play-offs as City lost 1\u20130 to Brighton & Hove Albion in the play-off final. He made 35 appearances in 2004\u201305, as new boss Brian Tinnion led the club to a 7th-place finish, one place and one point behind Hartlepool United in the play-offs.
