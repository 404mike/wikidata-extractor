A depiction of these by William Henry Bartlett was published in 1836, along with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, see . Under Ottoman rule, Christians and Jews were considered dhimmis and were allowed to practice their religious precepts. During the Damascus affair of 1840 the false accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. The massacre of Christians in 1860 was also one of the most notorious incidents of these centuries, when fighting between Druze and Maronites in Mount Lebanon spilled over into the city. Several thousand Christians were killed in June 1860, with many more being saved through the intervention of the Algerian exile Abd al-Qadir and his soldiers (three days after the massacre started), who brought them to safety in Abd al-Qadir's residence and the Citadel of Damascus. The Christian quarter of the old city (mostly inhabited by Catholics), including a number of churches, was burnt down. The Christian inhabitants of the notoriously poor and refractory Midan district outside the walls (mostly Orthodox) were, however, protected by their Muslim neighbors."]}, {"page": "Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel", "response": ["File:Tomb of the Kings.jpg|The \"Tombs of the Kings\", believed to be the tomb of Queen Helene of Adiabene; 19th-century lithograph by William Henry Bartlett"]}, {"page": "Eastport, Maine", "response": ["File:Eastport & Passamaquoddy Bay.jpg|Eastport and Passamaquoddy Bay, 1839, by William Henry Bartlett"]}, {"page": "Oval Office", "response": ["Most presidents have hung a portrait of George Washington \u2013 usually the Rembrandt Peale \"Porthole\" portrait or the Charles Willson Peale three-quarter-length portrait \u2013 over the mantel at the north end of the room.
