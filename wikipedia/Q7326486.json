This was based on a letter he saw in the 2nd edition Spiritualism and Oliver Lodge by Dr. Charles Arthur Mercier, from a cousin of George Pellew to Edward Clodd, alleging that Hodgson claimed that Professor Fiske from his s\u00e9ance with Piper was \"absolutely convinced\" Piper's control was the real George Pellew, but that when Pellew's brother contacted Fiske about it, he replied it was \"a lie\" as Piper had been \"silent or entirely wrong\" on all his questions.Joseph McCabe. (1920). Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined. London: Watts & Co. pp. 101\u2013105 However, Alan Gauld, referring to this letter as published by Clodd, stated that it was \"wholly unreliable\", noted that Hodgson in his original report wrote that Fiske had a negative attitude, and that Hodgson himself considered the Fiske sittings to be of no evidential value.Gauld, Alan.
