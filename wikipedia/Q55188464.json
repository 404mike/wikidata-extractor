According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction he is \"the world authority on the works of John Russell Fearn\", whose literary estate he represents,. Harbottle also penned up several biographical articles and monographs on Fearn. He was the editor the Vision of Tomorrow magazine (from August 1969-September 1970) and several anthologies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hyperspace", "response": ["Over the coming decades, a number of related terms (such as imaginary space, interspace, intersplit, jumpspace, megaflow, N-Space, nulspace, slipstream, overspace, Q-space,  subspace, and tau-space) were used by various writers, although none gained recognition to rival that of hyperspace. Out of various fictitious drives, by the mid-70s the concept of travelling through hyperspace by using a hyperdrive has been described as having achieved the most renown, and would subsequently be further popularized through its use in the Star Wars franchise. Philip Harbottle called the concept of hyperspace \"one of the fixtures\" of the science fiction genre as early as in 1963. Some works nonetheless use one or more of the hyperspace synonyms; for example, in the Star Trek franchise, the term hyperspace itself is only used briefly in a single episode (\"Coming of Age\") of Star Trek: The Next Generation, while a related set of terms - subspace, transwarp, mycelial network and most recently, proto-warp - are used much more often, while most of the travel takes place through the use of a warp drive."]}, {"page": "John Russell Fearn", "response": ["#Chameleon Planet (with Philip Harbottle)", "* The Multi-Man (1968 chap) by Philip Harbottle"]}, {"page": "List of Space: 1999 books and other media", "response": ["*Rogue Planet by E.C.
