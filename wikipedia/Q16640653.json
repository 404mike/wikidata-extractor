Due to the absence of the first Master, Sir Charles Warren, on a diplomatic mission in Southern Africa, the Lodge was not formally inaugurated until two years later. They insisted on using an evidence-based approach to the study of Masonic history. As such, their approach was new and unusual, and they intended that the results should \"replace the imaginative writings of earlier authors on the history of Freemasonry.\" This began what is now called the \"authentic school\" of Masonic research."]}, {"page": "Freemasonry in Denmark", "response": ["Freemasonry in Denmark was first established in 1743The Concise History of Freemasonry, by Robert Freke Gould, republished by Kessinger Publishing, 1994, hosted by Google Books and is today represented by a number of Grand Lodges.
