Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught over the loss of \"Leonard\", does not turn to see his face.  He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for another minute.  Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, \"Leonard\", but he says that his heart is like a \"massive rock\" and claims her as his bride.  Finally Elsie turns to see his face, and finally recognises him as her adored one.  All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, The Merryman and his Maid, with wrenching sorrow.  Elsie \"drops a tear\" for Point, but turns back to her love.  As the chorus turns away to celebrate the marriage of Fairfax and Elsie, Point falls insensible at their feet.In his autobiography, Henry Lytton notes that the question often arises whether or not Point dies of a broken heart at the end of Yeomen.  He and George Thorne both interpreted Point as dying at the end.  Lytton claims that W. S. Gilbert once told him that \"Point should die, and the end of the opera should be tragedy\".

This role was Barrington's least favourite of the series, and he attributed Ida's relatively short run, at least in part, to the lack of prominence of this role in the opera.Barrington (1908), p. 54 During the run of Princess Ida, a comedy written by Barrington and called Bartonmere Towers was first presented at a matinee."]}, {"page": "Geraldine Ulmar", "response": ["Ulmar next was hired to play Yum-Yum in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's first American production of The Mikado, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York, from 1885 to 1886, in a cast that included George Thorne (Ko-Ko), Courtice Pounds (Nanki-Poo), and Fred Billington (Pooh-Bah).G\u00e4nzl, p. 275 She joined a D'Oyly Carte touring company in England, singing Yum-Yum and Josephine for a few months, then Yum-Yum in the German company, before returning to America in the summer of 1886.
