In the 1970s, he began to include cartoon characters in his paintings. In several interviews he claimed: \"I learned more from Donald Duck than from all the schools that I have ever attended.\" Commenting on that aspect in Helnwein's work, Julia Pascal wrote in the New Statesman: \"His early watercolor Peinlich (Embarrassing)Gottfried Helnwein, Peinlich, color pencil, india-ink, and watercolor on cardboard, 60 x 35\u00a0cm, 1971 comic-helnwein shows a typical little 1950s girl in a pink dress and carrying a comic book.

In Epiphany I, SS officers surround a mother and child group. To judge by their looks and gestures, they appear to be interested in details such as head, face, back and genitals. The arrangement of the figures clearly relates to motive and iconography of the adoration of the three Magi, such as were common especially in the German, Italian and Dutch 15th century artworks. Julia Pascal wrote about this work in the New Statesman: \"This Austrian Catholic Nativity scene has no Magi bearing gifts. Madonna and child are encircled by five respectful Waffen SS officers palpably in awe of the idealised, blonde Virgin. The Christ toddler, who stands on Mary's lap, stares defiantly out of the canvas.\" Helnwein's baby Jesus is often considered to represent Adolf Hitler.", "* Julia Pascal, Nazi dreaming, New Statesman, UK, 10 April 2006.

Her opinion column began in 1987. While working for The Guardian, Phillips was persuaded to write a play called Traitors by Julia Pascal, who directed it. It was performed at the Drill Hall from January 1986. The play was set at the time of the 1982 Lebanon War and centred around the moral dilemmas of a Jewish journalist who as political editor of a liberal magazine has to decide whether to veto an article written in anti-semitic tones, and also whether she is right to publish a leaked document about the Falklands War. The play was reviewed by John Peter in The Sunday Times as \"a play of blistering intelligence and fearless moral questioning\", although he considered it bordering on implausible.Peter, John. \"Amoral acquiescence\". The Sunday Times. 26 January 1986. According to Phillips, writing in December 2017, it was the only positive review the play received. Phillips left The Guardian in 1993, saying that her relationship with the paper and its readers had become \"like a really horrific family argument\", and that she had seen the \"reality\" that \"the west ha[d] lost its moral compass\".

The composer of the 1960s musical Oliver!, Lionel Bart, was Jewish, and he wrote songs for the character with a Jewish rhythm and Jewish orchestration. In spite of the musical's Jewish provenance, Jewish playwright Julia Pascal believes that performing the show today is still inappropriate, an example of a minority acting out on a stereotype to please a host society. Pascal claimed that \"U.S. Jews are not exposed to the constant low-level anti-Semitism that filters through British society\". In contrast to Pascal, The actor David Schneider, who studied for a PhD on Yiddish, found the Dickens novel, wherein Fagin is simply \"the Jew,\" a difficult read, but saw Fagin in the musical as \"a complex character\" who was not \"the baddie.\" Stage producer Menachem Golan also created a less well-known Hebrew musical of Oliver Twist.e-bay listing of DVD"]}, {"page": "List of Jewish atheists and agnostics", "response": ["* Julia PascalJulia Pascal, interviewed for the article 'Sikh theatre row: Can censorship ever be justified?', The Guardian, December 22, 2004, Pg. 7. \u2013 British playwright and theater director"]}, {"page": "2012 Man Booker Prize", "response": ["Deborah Levy, born in South Africa, is the author of a number of plays and novels.
