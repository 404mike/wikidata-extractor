Claire was a jewel thief and to escape the Indian Police-Detectives, she faked her death and assumed the identity of \"Helen Marsden\". Other changes include the deletion of some of Helen's suitors, and the addition of a travelling company of performers called The Funnybones, which Helen was performing with at the time of her death.

At the end, Gwenda leaves him and becomes engaged to a member of his company, Hugh Hornbeam. Dr Kennedy does not try to kill Gwenda and does not appear to be crazy, merely that he was in love with his sister and killed her so no one could have her.
