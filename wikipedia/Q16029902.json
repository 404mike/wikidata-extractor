Here he added elements of local architectural styles to his classicism, and based his urbanisation scheme on Mughal water gardens. He also designed the Hyderabad House for the last Nizam of Hyderabad, as his Delhi palace."]}, {"page": "Castle Drogo", "response": ["Castle Drogo is a country house and mixed-revivalist castle near Drewsteignton, Devon, England. Constructed between 1911 and 1930, it was the last castle to be built in England. The client was Julius Drewe, the hugely successful founder of the Home and Colonial Stores. Drewe chose the site in the belief that it formed part of the lands of his supposed medieval ancestor, Drogo de Teigne. The architect he chose to realise his dream was Edwin Lutyens, then at the height of his career. Lutyens lamented Drewe's determination to have a castle but nevertheless produced one of his finest buildings. The architectural critic, Christopher Hussey, described the result: \"The ultimate justification of Drogo is that it does not pretend to be a castle. It is a castle, as a castle is built, of granite, on a mountain, in the twentieth century\".", "In 1910 Julius Drewe bought about  south and west of the village of Drewsteignton in the belief that he was descended from the Drewe family that once lived here. Born Drew, the son of George Smith Drew and his wife Mary, n\u00e9e Peek, both from substantial families of grocers, Drewe added the \"e\" to his surname later in life. At the age of 18, Drewe was sent to China as a tea-buyer by his uncle, Francis Peek (c.1836\u201399), a partner in Liverpool tea-merchants Peek and Winch. Julius's great uncle, Richard Peek (1782\u20131867), one of the three brothers who founded Peek and Winch, was an abolitionist and philanthropist who was on the organising committee of the anti-slavery conventions held in London in 1840 and 1843. The Peek and Winch company later expanded into coffee, cocoa, rubber and spices, and owned plantations in the Dutch East Indies. In 1878, Drewe returned to Liverpool and opened the Willow Pattern Tea Store. In 1883, Drewe and John Musker (1846\u20131926) founded the Home and Colonial Trading Association (later Home and Colonial Stores), which sold teas selected in India by Drewe, alongside other groceries. By 1903, the company had 500 stores. By the time of his death in 1931 he had bought up an estate of 1,500 acres. Around 1910 he asked Edwin Lutyens to build him a castle. According to his son Basil, he did so on the advice of Edward Hudson, proprietor of Country Life magazine, who was both a patron and a champion of Lutyens. Drewe was now 54 years old, but he still had time, energy and money to create his new family seat. The budget was \u00a350,000 for the castle, and a further \u00a310,000 for the garden. Lutyens wrote privately of his concern over Drewe's ambitions; \"I do wish he didn't want a castle but just a delicious loveable house with plenty of good large rooms in it\". On 4 April 1911, Drewe's 55th birthday, the first foundation stone was laid.The Heritage Trail | Castle Drogo "]}, {"page": "Broadhembury", "response": ["Julius Drewe purchased the inn, and half the village, at the turn of the 20th century.

The Buxtons had never been a hugely rich family; Jill Franklin, in her study The Gentleman's Country House And Its Plan: 1835-1914, records the income from their 10,000 acre estate in the mid-19th century as \u00a37,260 per year. In contrast, the buyer of the estate, John Musker, was a very successful grocer who founded the Home and Colonial Stores in partnership with Julius Drewe. The Muskers owned the estate until the 1980s, when it was sold to  Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum who incorporated it into his Nunnery Stud, based at Thetford. The court has not been lived in since the 1990s, and in 2019 it was placed on the Heritage at Risk Register over concerns as to its condition. The then director of The Victorian Society, Christopher Costelloe suggested, \"Shadwell Court\u2019s owner can easily afford to look after this important building properly. This major country house has been neglected for far too long and it will be a scandal if it isn\u2019t put right soon\". The Shadwell Stud contested the allegations of neglect, noting that over \u00a31.6M had been spent on conserving the structure since its purchase by the Al Maktoum family."]}]}}
