He is Director of PRASADA, a centre bringing together research and practice in South Asian art and architecture.\nHis research is largely in the history of architecture in South Asia, particularly Hindu temple architecture, as well as that of Indian Buddhist and  Jain temples. Going against a prevailing tendency to focus narrowly, his work has embraced most of the subcontinent, and a very long time span, while at the same time involving detailed formal analysis. He has tried to bring to light a meaningful way of looking at what at first sight seem bewilderingly complex structures. The work has revealed striking structural homologies between architecture and other branches of culture, and shown how, within a number of regional traditions, forms evolve in a characteristic way, notwithstanding conspicuous artistic inventiveness. Drawings have played an important role in his research, not only for explanation but also as a means of analysis.\nHe was educated at the Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe (1965\u201371) and Trinity College, Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hoysala architecture", "response": ["Hoysala architecture is classified by the influential scholar Adam Hardy as part of the Karnata Dravida tradition, a trend within Dravidian architecture in the Deccan that is distinct from the Tamil style of further south.  Other terms for the tradition are Vesara, and Chalukya architecture, divided into early Badami Chalukya architecture and the Western Chalukya architecture which immediately preceded the Hoysalas. The whole tradition covers a period of about seven centuries began in the 7th century under the patronage of the Chalukya dynasty of Badami, developed further under the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta during the 9th and 10th centuries and the Western Chalukyas (or Later Chalukyas) of Basavakalyan in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its final development stage and transformation into an independent style was during the rule of the Hoysalas in the 12th and 13th centuries.Hardy (1995), pp. 6\u20137, section Introduction-Dynasties and Periods Medieval inscriptions displayed prominently at temple locations give information about donations made toward the maintenance of the temple, details of consecration and on occasion, even architectural details.Foekema (2003), p. 18"]}, {"page": "Architecture of India", "response": ["For most modern writers, nagara refers to north Indian styles, most easily recognised by a high and curving shikhara over the sanctuary, dravida or Dravidian architecture is the broad South Indian style, where the superstructure over the sanctuary is not usually extremely high, and has a straight profile, rising in series of terraces to form a sort of decorated pyramid (today often dwarfed in larger temples by the far larger gopuram outer gateways, a much later development).Rowland, 276 The ancient term vesara is also used by some modern writers, to describe a temple style with characteristics of both the northern and southern traditions. These come from the Deccan and other fairly central parts of India.  There is some disagreement among those who use the term, as to the exact period and styles it represents, and other writers prefer to avoid it; temples some describe as vesara are mostly assigned to the northern tradition by those, but are regarded as a kind of northern dravida by others.Adam Hardy for example uses \"Kar\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da Dr\u0101vi\u1e0da\" for styles others call \"vesara\".

According to some, the style was started by the Chalukyas of Badami (500-753AD) whose Early Chalukya or Badami Chalukya architecture built temples in a style that mixed some features of the nagara and the dravida styles, for example using both the northern shikhara and southern vimana type of superstructure over the sanctum in different temples of similar date, as at Pattadakal.  However, Adam Hardy and others regard this style as essentially a form of Dravida.  This style was further refined by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (750-983AD) in sites such as Ellora."]}, {"page": "Hindu temple architecture", "response": ["Some scholars have questioned the relevance of these texts, whether the artists relied on silpa sastras theory and Sanskrit construction manuals probably written by Brahmins, and did these treatises precede or follow the big temples and ancient sculptures therein. Other scholars question whether big temples and complex symmetric architecture or sculpture with consistent themes and common iconography across distant sites, over many centuries, could have been built by artists and architects without adequate theory, shared terminology and tools, and if so how. According to Adam Hardy \u2013 an architecture historian and professor of Asian Architecture, the truth \"must lie somewhere in between\".

The conditions and \"mixed\" features for Vesara are also found in Bhumija and Varata architecture, where synthesis and innovation drives the North Indian and South Indian towards being variants of each other. The discovery of early examples of elliptical, circular, apsidal Hindu temples, states Dubey, may correspond to the Vesara as they once existed and what the South Indian texts were referring to, at the time they were composed.Lal Mani Dubey (1978), Some Observations on the Vesara School of Hindu Architecture, Proceedings of the Indian History Congress, Vol. 39, Issue II, pp. 1000-1006,  Adam Hardy states that these inventive forms are better understood in terms of the architecture schools and their geographical context, with the note that these schools shared and competed in their ideas.
