He was born at Leicester and died at Roehampton in London.\nTurner was the son of Luke Turner, a manufacturer of elastic webbing in Leicester whose factory is now a listed building. He was educated at Uppingham School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. At both Uppingham and Cambridge, Turner played cricket as a right-handed middle-order batsman \u2013 occasionally used as an opener \u2013 and a right-arm fast bowler, rarely used as one of the main bowlers by his teams. Without ever achieving much in the matches themselves, he was picked for the University Match against Oxford University in each of his four seasons at Cambridge. His best performances came in 1885 and 1886. Against a scratch side raised by A. J. Webbe in 1885, he scored an unbeaten 109. The following year, against another scratch side, this time raised by C. I. Thornton, he made a second innings 174 which was instrumental in enabling Cambridge to win the match after being made to follow on. The innings made Turner's reputation, and he was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at The Oval after the university term was over, though he had no success. At the end of both the 1885 and 1886 English cricket seasons, Turner joined in a tour of North America organised by the Devonian amateur Ned Sanders, and on each of these tours there were two first-class matches; Turner's best bowling figures of four wickets for 46 runs (in 50 four-ball overs) came in a game against a \"Gentlemen of Philadelphia\" side on the 1885 tour. After leaving Cambridge University in 1886, Turner played only a couple of further first-class matches, though he appeared in minor matches for Leicestershire (not then a first-class team) through to 1892 and for the I Zingari amateur side to 1894.Turner graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Laws (LlB) degree, and joined the Inner Temple. He was called to the bar and practised as a barrister on the Midland Circuit. His address at the time of his death in 1924 was in Knightsbridge, London, though he died in The Priory, Roehampton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Turner (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Turner (1929\u20132020) was the 17th Prime Minister of Canada.", "John Turner may also refer to:", "*John Turner (1737\u20131787), English potter of the Turner family", "*John Turner (lyricist) (born 1932), English lyricist", "*John Turner (actor) (born 1932), British actor", "*\"Uncle\" John Turner (1933\u20132007), American drummer of Johnny Winter Band", "*John Nathan-Turner n\u00e9 John Turner (1947\u20132002), British television producer", "*John Turner, a Canadian comedic actor associated with the clown duo Mump and Smoot", "*John Turner (MP for Bletchingley), MP for Bletchingley in 1601", "*John Turner (died 1712), British Member of Parliament for King's Lynn", "*Sir John Turner, 2nd Baronet, British Member of Parliament for King's Lynn in 1712", "*Sir John Turner, 3rd Baronet, British Member of Parliament for King's Lynn in 1739\u20131768", "*John Turner (Australian politician) (born 1949)", "*John Turner (Illinois politician) (born 1956), American politician and judge", "*John Turner (Texas politician) (born 1974), Texas state representative", "*John Turner (cricketer, born 1816) (1816\u20131892), Cambridge University cricketer and clergyman", "*John Turner (cricketer, born 1863) (1863\u20131924), Cambridge University cricketer and lawyer", "*John Turner (cricketer, born 2001)", "*John Turner (1890s footballer), English football player for Manchester United", "*John Turner (Minor Counties cricketer) (1949\u20132012), former English cricketer", "*John Turner (footballer, born 1954), English football goalkeeper", "*John Turner (American football) (born 1956), former National Football League player", "*John Turner (basketball) (born 1967), American former basketball player", "*John Turner (footballer, born 1986), English football forward", "*John Turner (Mayflower passenger) (c. 1590\u20131651)", "*John Turner (fl. 1668\u20131676), New England merchant for whom the House of the Seven Gables in Salem, Massachusetts was built", "*John Turner (archdeacon of Taunton) (died 1817), English Anglican priest, archdeacon of Taunton", "*John Turner (bishop) (died 1831), Anglican bishop", "*John Turner (architect) (1806\u20131890), English architect", "*John Turner (fur trapper) (1807\u20131847), American fur trapper and investor in the Willamette Cattle Company", "*John Turner (naval officer) (1864\u20131949), Australian naval officer", "*John Turner (anarchist) (1865\u20131934), Scottish anarchist and trade union leader", "*John Turner (Archdeacon of Basingstoke) (1867\u20131952), English Anglican priest, archdeacon of Winchester", "*John Turner (psychologist) (1947\u20132011), British social psychologist", "*John Turner, a character in the 1891 Sherlock Holmes short story \"The Boscombe Valley Mystery\""]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* John Turner (1886)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* John Turner (1887) : J.
