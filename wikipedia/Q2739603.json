She was active during and after World War II, designing social and public housing in England, West Africa, India and Iran.\nWith her second husband, Maxwell Fry, she worked in West Africa designing schools and universities. She, Fry and Pierre Jeanneret, designed the housing at Chandigarh, the new capital of the Punjab. She designed buildings in Ghana, Nigeria, Iran and Sri Lanka, and she wrote books on what she had learnt about architecture there.  In London she did social housing, buildings for the Festival of Britain, and helped to establish the Institute of Contemporary Arts.
