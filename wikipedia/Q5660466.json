Born in Hulme, Manchester, he played for Old Trafford, Manchester United and Mossley.\nFollowing Manchester United's relegation to the Second Division at the end of the 1930\u201331 season, Dean was one of 31 amateur players signed by the club. He joined from the nearby Old Trafford Amateur club and made his debut in a 3\u20131 win at home to Chesterfield on 26 September 1931, filling in for the absent Tommy Reid. He also played in the next game, a 2\u20130 defeat at Burnley, but while his speed and effort were praised, his control and shooting were deemed not to be up to scratch. He did not play for Manchester United again and was transferred to Cheshire County League side Mossley in December 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Dean", "response": ["Harold Dean may refer to:", "* Harold Dean (footballer) (1910\u2013?), English footballer", "* Harold Dean (politician) (1913\u20131997), Queensland politician"]}]}}
