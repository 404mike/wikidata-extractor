In July, Spencer interviewed climate change sceptic Christopher Monckton. The interview became heated as Spencer asked Monckton about his status as a member of the House of Lords, or if he was a Nobel Laureate, or academic credentials. Monckton told Spencer to \"shut up and listen\", and then Spencer hung up on him, and later called back to resume the discussion. Both Spencer and the producer later apologised to Monckton. The House of Lords later published an open letter, clarifying that Monckton is not a member of the Upper House. David Beamish (Clerk of the Parliaments) wrote the letter, clarifying that Monckton is a peer, which is a separate issue to House membership. Monckton challenged the letter during a presentation at the National Press Club."]}, {"page": "Sir David Beamish", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Beamish"]}, {"page": "David Richard Beamish", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Beamish"]}, {"page": "Sir David Richard Beamish", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Beamish"]}, {"page": "Beamish, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Beamish"]}]}}
