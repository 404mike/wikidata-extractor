The reason for the error of Ishiwara, which was manifested in the calculation of the hydrogen atom, apparently was a superfluous averaging over the number of degrees of freedom (dividing by j before the sum). At the same time, his quantum condition, which differed from Sommerfeld's one in the presence of summation, allowed to obtain correct results regardless of the choice of coordinates. This was pointed out in 1917 by Einstein, who, not knowing about the work of Ishiwara, derived the same relation and showed that in the case of separable coordinates it gives the conditions of Wilson and Sommerfeld."]}]}}
