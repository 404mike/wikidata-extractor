The earliest such trail was of Captain Henry Pedris which started on 1 July 1915, within three days he was found guilty of treason executed swiftly on the 7 July. A writ of prohibition was filled in the Supreme Court of Ceylon to stay the execution, the Supreme Court bench headed by the Chief Justice Alexander Wood Renton denied it down citing that the Supreme Court lack jurisdiction over the military courts that were functioning under martial law at the time. Captain Pedris's death sentence was not referred to the Governor for ratification as it was required. An omission that was protested by the Governor, and later cases were dully forwarded. Further writs filled in the Supreme Court for W. A. de Silva and Edmund Hewavitarne were turned down citing Supreme Court's lack jurisdiction over the military courts. Edmund Hewavitarne was imprisoned and died in prison due to lack of medical care. Many respected Sinhalese were removed from colonial appointments such as Hulugalle Adigar, who was stripped of his title of Adigar on the account he was not present in his home area during the riots.THE RECENT CEYLON DISTURBANCES.A vignette of British Justice in Colonial Ceylon The Island (Sri Lanka) Retrieved 23 December 2014", "The colonial administration established a Police Inquiry Commission to inquire into the riots in late 1915 made up five members with Chief Justis Sir Alexander Wood Renton as Chairman and it contained one Sinhalese member Sir Solomon Obeyesekere.

The Commissioners were Chief Justis Sir Alexander Wood Renton and G. S. Schnieder. The Commission found that, \"In each of the cases that have been under investigation the act of shooting cannot be justified on the ground of existence of Martial Law; in short, it had no legal justification.\u2019 But, they said, they were bona fide for the maintenance of good order and government and for the public safety of the Colony, and, that action was protected by the Ceylon Indemnity order in Council, 1915.\""]}]}}
