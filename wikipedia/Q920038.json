As manager he won the 1954 FA Cup with West Bromwich Albion and finished runners-up in the Football League First Division. He had two periods with AFC Ajax, leading the side to the Dutch Championship of 1960. In 1964 Johan Cruyff made his league debut under him. In 1971, his FC Barcelona side finished as league runners-up and won the Spanish Cup. He also held manager positions with Fulham FC, Sheffield Wednesday and in Greece. Buckingham is considered to have been a pioneer of the footballing philosophy known as Total Football, later further developed by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Johan Cruyff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "AFC Ajax", "response": ["*  Vic Buckingham (1959\u201361)", "*  Vic Buckingham (1964\u201365)"]}, {"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["|| Vic Buckingham"]}, {"page": "Walter Winterbottom", "response": ["He soon created a national coaching scheme with summer residential courses at Lilleshall, Shropshire, and persuaded some of his international players to take the courses that led to exams for the FA preliminary and full coaching badges. This gave the scheme credibility. They developed their teaching skills by coaching in schools and then moved into part-time coaching positions in junior clubs. He gathered around him a cadre of young FA staff coaches: men like Bill Nicholson, Don Howe, Alan Brown, Ron Greenwood, Dave Sexton, Malcolm Allison, Joe Mercer, Vic Buckingham, Jimmy Hill and Bobby Robson. Over time a new breed of managers emerged in the League clubs and began to change attitudes to coaching."]}, {"page": "Bobby Robson", "response": ["In 1950, Robson made his first-team debut for Fulham, recently promoted to the First Division, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday. He came to regard Fulham as \"a nice club, a social club...\", but \"never... a serious, championship-challenging club\". Indeed, he and Fulham were relegated from the top-flight in the 1951\u201352 season, but he made his return to the First Division, four years later, when he signed for Vic Buckingham's West Bromwich Albion in March 1956. The transfer fee of \u00a325,000 was a club record for West Brom at the time.", "During his first spell at Fulham, Robson participated in two ambassadorial Football Association tours in the West Indies in 1955 and South Africa in 1956. However, it was during his time at West Bromwich Albion that he graduated to the full England squad, with his first call-up in 1956. His manager, Vic Buckingham, advocated the \"push and run\" approach to the game, a precursor to \"total football\", and playing this, Robson graduated to the full England squad in 1956, It was also at West Brom when Robson met future England international and assistant coach Don Howe."]}, {"page": "Total Football", "response": ["Also in the 1940s, English manager Jack Reynolds, implemented a Total Football style while at Dutch club Ajax. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Burnley were playing a renewed system in English football \"where every player could play in every position\" under manager Harry Potts. This Total Football system led the club to the 1959\u201360 First Division title and won many plaudits, including admiration from all-time English First Division top scorer Jimmy Greaves.Quelch (2015), p. 11 Another pioneer was Vic Buckingham, manager of West Bromwich Albion, Ajax and Barcelona in the 1950s and 1960s, as his philosophy was later further developed by Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff, a player who was introduced into the Ajax first team by Buckingham."]}, {"page": "Sevilla FC", "response": ["|  Vic Buckingham"]}, {"page": "Ronnie Allen", "response": ["Allen was transferred to West Bromwich Albion on 2 March 1950 for \u00a320,000, a club record fee for both clubs at the time. This was more than double the previous Albion record, set when Jackie Vernon was brought to the club three years earlier. Allen scored on his debut two days later to secure a 1\u20131 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers in a First Division match. The attendance of 60,945 remains a record for a league game at The Hawthorns. Though only  and barely , he emerged as a talented striker, helping to define the modern role of target man. Signed by Jack Smith, he was soon converted from a wide player into a centre-forward. Allen also benefited from the ultra-modern training techniques of Jesse Carver, who served Albion as manager for a brief time in the 1952\u201353 campaign. Carver's successor, Vic Buckingham, also had a Total Football philosophy, and appreciated the technical skill Allen possessed, allowing him to play as a deep-lying attacker with room to dribble at will \u2013 a revolutionary position and tactic.", "His autobiography, It's goals that count, with a foreword by Vic Buckingham, was published in 1955. He had a son, Russell Allen, who started his career at West Brom, before playing close to 300 league games at Tranmere Rovers and Mansfield Town between 1971 and 1981."]}, {"page": "Jesse Carver", "response": ["Carver still wanted to prove himself in England however, and in the summer of 1952, he was persuaded to return to coach West Brom and had an immediate impact with the team playing attacking football and up among the league leaders. Carver left late January 1954 as he wasn't appointed manager despite his success and in early 1953, leaving his job to his assistant Vic Buckingham. Torino lured him back to Italy and he saved the famous club from relegation."]}]}}
