Dollin was paid \u00a31 per week and found a job, although his status as a professional was kept a secret for a number of years. Dollin only remained with the Saints until the end of the season, before knee injuries caused him to revert to amateur status, rejoining Freemantle. Ridges did make one appearance for St. Mary's, when he played on loan in the Second Qualifying Round of the FA Cup against Maidenhead on 29 October 1892. The match was played at the Antelope Ground and ended 4\u20130 to the visitors, with F.W. Janes scoring a hat-trick\u00a0\u2013 this was St. Mary's first defeat in a cup competition since their foundation seven years earlier. Shortly after the FA Cup match, St. Mary's and Freemantle met in a friendly, with the match ending 3\u20133.", "After the match, the Freemantle supporters \"went on a revel\"; local legend has it that the Cup was found next early the morning \"sitting unattended in the middle of the road outside a local hostelry\u00a0\u2013 presumably the Waterloo Arms\". At the club's end of season dinner the Magpies' captain, George Ridges, told the gathering that he \"did not see why they should not call their club Southampton Football Club\"."]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 St. Mary's F.C. season", "response": ["To bolster the side, the committee attempted to recruit George Ridges on professional terms from local rivals, Freemantle, but Ridges refused the offer and remained with the \"Magpies\" as an amateur. The \"Saints\" then turned their attentions to another Freemantle player, Jack Dollin, who was paid \u00a31 a week and found a job, thus becoming the club's first professional player, although the club kept his professional status a secret for many years, for fear of being ostracised by other clubs.", "In the Second Qualifying Round they played Maidenhead at the Antelope Ground on 29 October 1892. Although the team was boosted by Ernie Nicholls (who had returned from his temporary absence) and George Ridges (on loan from Freemantle), they suffered a 4\u20130 defeat. Apart from the Hampshire County Cricket Club Charity Cup the previous April, this was the Saints first defeat in a cup match. Three of Maidenhead's goals were scored by F.W. Janes. St. Mary's promptly signed Janes on professional terms, but the signing was revoked by the Football Association, who judged that he was \"in no fit condition to realise what he was doing when he signed for Southampton\", presumably because he had consumed too much alcohol at the time of signing."]}, {"page": "Ridges, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Ridges"]}]}}
