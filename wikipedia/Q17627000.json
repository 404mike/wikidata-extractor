Jack Powell missed his train connection at Chester and Kenrick turned out in his everyday clothes to give \"a splendid performance\" at right-back. Some years later, William Pierce Owen recalled the match at Blackburn:It was snowing and hailing and we had been playing for some time, when I saw what I thought was a spectator breaking into the field and making a violent attack upon Marshall and Rostron, the English right wing. Upon closer inspection I found it was Llewelyn Kenrick of Ruabon. He was dressed in long tweed trousers, wore ordinary boots and sported a smart Oxford shirt. He played with the utmost vigour until unfortunately his knee gave way and once more Wales had only ten men on the field.Davies and Garland (1991), p. 157"]}, {"page": "Ruthin Town F.C.", "response": ["*William Pierce Owen \u2013 12 caps"]}, {"page": "William Owen", "response": ["*William Pierce Owen (1860\u20131937), Ruthin Town F.C. and Wales international footballer"]}, {"page": "Wales national football team results (1876\u20131899)", "response": ["|Friendly|| John Price (4), William Pierce Owen (2), John Morgan || 2,000 ", "|Friendly|| William Pierce Owen (2), John Morgan, Alf Jones (og), John Vaughan || 5,000 ", "|1883\u201384 British Home Championship|| William Pierce Owen (2), Edward Shaw (2), John Eyton-Jones, Robert Albert Jones || 2,000 "]}, {"page": "Elias Owen (priest)", "response": ["* William Pierce Owen (1860\u20131937), who played international football for Wales, making 12 appearances and scoring six goals.
