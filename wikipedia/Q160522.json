Physicists were uncertain of the nature of X-rays, but soon suspected that they were waves of electromagnetic radiation, a form of light. The Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation was well accepted among scientists, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with electromagnetic waves, including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Barkla created the x-ray notation, as well, noting in 1909 two separate types of diffraction beams, at first, naming them \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d and then supposing that there may be lines prior to \u201cA\u201d, he started an alphabet numbering beginning with \u201cK.\u201dBarkla, Charles G.
