Though he wrote several books of poetry, Henley is remembered most often for his 1875 poem \"Invictus\". A fixture in London literary circles, the one-legged Henley was also the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's character Long John Silver (Treasure Island, 1883), while his young daughter Margaret Henley inspired J. M. Barrie's choice of the name Wendy for the heroine of his play Peter Pan (1904).", "link_mentions": {}}}
