Though he wrote several books of poetry, Henley is remembered most often for his 1875 poem \"Invictus\". A fixture in London literary circles, the one-legged Henley was also the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's character Long John Silver (Treasure Island, 1883), while his young daughter Margaret Henley inspired J. M.

With his personal connections and enthusiasm for Rodin's art, Henley was most responsible for Rodin's reception in Britain.

Stephen took Stevenson to visit a patient at the Edinburgh Infirmary named William Ernest Henley, an energetic and talkative poet with a wooden leg.
