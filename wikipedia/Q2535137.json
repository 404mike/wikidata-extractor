He was soon joined by Judy Parfitt as Vermeer's domineering mother-in-law, and Essie Davis, who portrayed Vermeer's wife Catharina. The Australian daughter of an artist, Davis did not believe her character was the film's \"bad guy,\" as \"[Catharina] has a certain role to play for you to want Griet and Vermeer to be involved.\" Cillian Murphy, known for his recent role in 28 Days Later, was hired as Pieter, Griet's butcher love interest.  Murphy, taking on his first period film role, was interested in serving as a foil to Firth's Vermeer, and representing the \"ordinary\" world that Griet seeks to avoid upon her meeting the artist. Other cast members included Joanna Scanlan as the maid Tanneke, as well as the young actresses Alakina Mann and Anna Popplewell as Vermeer's daughters, Cornelia and Maertge, respectively."]}]}}
