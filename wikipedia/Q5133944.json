He made his debut for Gillingham as a second-half substitute for Clint Easton in a 2\u20131 home win over Cheltenham Town."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Abdou", "response": ["Abdou made his Millwall debut, starting a match before being substituted in the 75th minute, in a 4\u20133 loss against Oldham Athletic in the opening game of the season. Since joining Millwall, he quickly became a fan favourite among Millwall's supporters. Abdou's signature has turned out to be something of a coup for manager Kenny Jackett. In spite of one or two short-term injuries, Abdou has been successful at Millwall, holding down a regular first team slot in central midfield when fit. It was not until on 11 October 2008 when he scored his first Millwall goal, in a 3\u20131 win against Tranmere Rovers. However, in a 1\u20130 win over Hereford United on 28 October 2008, Abdou was sent\u2013off in the 49th minute for a \"double-footed lunge\" on Clint Easton and served a two match suspension. He made his return from suspension on 22 November 2008, coming on as a second-half substitute, in a 0\u20130 draw against Leyton Orient. At the beginning of January, Abdou missed three matches through injury and made his return on 17 January 2009, coming on as a substitute in the second half, in a 1\u20130 win over Tranmere Rovers. He later scored twice for the club, in a 4\u20132 loss against Bristol Rovers on 18 April 2009. Abdou scored the winning goal in the League One Playoff Semi-finals against Leeds United at Elland Road on 14 May 2009 to send them to Wembley for their first ever playoff final, which they lost 3\u20132 to Scunthorpe United. Abdou later reflected that scoring against Leeds United was a turning point of his career. After missing out on promotion during the 2008\u201309 season, he went on to make forty\u2013three appearances and scoring four times in his first season at Millwall."]}, {"page": "2008 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Cardiff City entered the competition in the third round, receiving a bye as a Football League Championship club. They were drawn against Southern League Division One Midlands side Chasetown, who had become the lowest-ranked side ever to reach the third round of the competition after defeating Port Vale in the second round. The difference in league positions between the two sides was also the largest in the tournament's history. Cardiff were given an early scare as an own goal by defender Kevin McNaughton, from a cross by Ben Steane, gave Chasetown the lead in the 17th minute. Midfielder Peter Whittingham scored a first half injury time equaliser for Cardiff. Teenager Aaron Ramsey, making his first appearance in an FA Cup match, put Cardiff ahead with a close-range header and winger Paul Parry hit the ball through Chasetown goalkeeper Lee Evans' legs to ensure progression to the fourth round. Cardiff were drawn away to League Two side Hereford United at Edgar Street. McNaughton opened the scoring with his first goal for Cardiff striking a volley from the edge of the Hereford penalty area during first-half injury time. They extended their lead when striker Steven Thompson converted a penalty after McNaughton was felled by Clint Easton. Hereford scored in the 77th minute through striker Theo Robinson, but they were unable to score an equaliser and Cardiff won the match 2\u20131 to go through to the fifth round. This was the first time since 1994 that Cardiff had progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|11||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Clint Easton", "|  Clint Easton"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Hereford United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| 11 ||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Clint Easton", "|  Clint Easton"]}, {"page": "2002 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["The match kicked off at 3:30p.m. in front of a Millennium Stadium crowd of 71,597.
