After turning professional he spent four weeks of the 2000\u201301 season on loan at Northampton Town, three months on loan at Notts County in the 2001\u201302 season, and the first half of the 2002\u201303 season on loan at Belgian side K.S.K. Beveren. He spent the second half of the 2002\u201303 season and the whole of the 2003\u201304 campaign on loan at Colchester United, after which he was allowed to join the club permanently. He stayed at Colchester for the next two years, and helped the club win promotion into the Championship, before he transferred to Preston North End in July 2006. He spent four years with the club, though was out of action for a year due to injury. He re-joined Notts County on a permanent basis in July 2010, and was loaned out to Port Vale in September 2011. He signed with AFC Telford United in September 2012, before beginning a second loan spell with Port Vale in November 2012, which was made into a permanent move two months later. He helped Vale win promotion out of League Two in 2012\u201313.

He signed a new two-year contract in June 2014."]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["After losing his job at Bramall Lane, he was immediately offered a three-year contract at former club Port Vale. He signed the contract within days, saying it was time to \"finish the job I started\". Upon hearing the news, star defender Gareth Owen reversed his decision to leave the club, and promptly signed a two-year deal as player-coach. In a shock move Adams announced that he intended to take up a directorship at the club as the club's constitution stipulated that a minimum of four directors were needed before any playing contracts could be completed. His first signings of the season were former Glenn Hoddle Academy youngsters Ryan Burge and Ben Williamson. He followed this by tying Gary Roberts to the club for another season, and signing Walsall centre-half Clayton McDonald, left-back Mike Green, and Sheffield United teenagers Kingsley James and Phil Roe. Days before the start of the season he let Justin Richards leave on a free transfer to Burton Albion, and replaced him with Rotherham United striker Tom Pope, also a free transfer signing. After his team started the campaign with a glut of goals \u2013 both scoring and conceding \u2013 Adams decided to give his players \"a kick up the backside\" by signing experienced defenders Liam Chilvers (on loan) and Rob Kozluk. He stepped down as a director on 5 November, the day of his 100th game in charge at Port Vale, after former director Stan Meigh withdrew the \u00a350,000 sponsorship he had provided to keep Adams on the board of directors.", "With the club still unable to sign new players due to administration in May 2012, Adams offered contracts to 16 of his players for the 2012\u201313 campaign. However, he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins, Anthony Griffith, Sean Rigg, and captain and top-scorer Marc Richards; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere, leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch. He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion, finishing as the division's top-scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign."]}, {"page": "John Halls", "response": ["The player spent the entire 2002\u201303 season playing for KSK Beveren in Belgian First Division along with fellow Arsenal youngsters Graham Stack, Steve Sidwell and Liam Chilvers.

This was despite a bid from Championship rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, for whom he had played three trial games during that summer. An ever-present in his debut season, he formed a strong partnership with Chris Lucketti. His good form that year was rewarded with the Player of the Season award. In the 2005\u201306 season, he formed another strong partnership with Claude Davis as Preston reached the play-offs for the second season in a row. In the 2008\u201309 season, Maw\u00e9n\u00e9 had another partnership with Sean St Ledger and occasionally Liam Chilvers, helping Preston to, again, reach the play-offs. Maw\u00e9n\u00e9 tore cruciate and medial knee ligaments in a pre-season match against Manchester United at Deepdale and missed the entire 2006\u201307 season.

However, he was dropped after the next match, a 4\u20130 defeat at home to Morecambe, only to win back his first-team place the following month after turning down the chance to leave the club on loan. With the loanees back at their parent clubs, Gareth Owen out injured and Clayton McDonald in court, McCombe helped to guide teenage centre back Joe Davis through the final stages of the season.

On 9 April 2007, St Ledger scored his first goal for Preston in a 3\u20132 loss against Southend United. In his first season at Deepdale, St Ledger made 42 appearances whilst scoring one goal as Preston, who had been top of the league mid-season, failed to retain a playoff berth come May."]}, {"page": "History of Preston North End F.C.", "response": ["Simpson had been the manager of Carlisle United and he quickly replaced the recently departed defenders Claude Davis and Tyrone Mears with Sean St. Ledger and Liam Chilvers.

On 28 March, striker David Nugent made his full international debut for England and scored in the 90th minute of the match against Andorra. Nugent was the first Preston player since Tom Finney to represent England.

Despite Gannon's swift departure, contract talks continued on a new two-year deal. After playing in all 54 of the club's games that season, he put pen to paper on the deal in May 2011. Micky Adams returned as manager for the 2011\u201312 campaign, and he continued to name Yates as his first choice right-back. However Adams signed centre-back Liam Chilvers and veteran full-back Rob Kozluk in September, and so Yates lost his first-team place to Kozluk, and put in 'extra work' in training to try and force his way back onto the teamsheet. His efforts paid off, as he quickly won his first-team place back, and Kozluk was released in December. He scored his first league goal for the club by providing the equalizer in the 2\u20131 Boxing Day victory at Hereford United. In February, he picked up knee-ligament damage and was unable to play for several weeks. He hit his third goal for the \"Valiants\" on 9 April, in a 1\u20130 win over Macclesfield Town."]}, {"page": "Chilvers", "response": ["* Liam Chilvers, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Clayton McDonald", "response": ["After David Artell left the club, Gareth Owen picked up an injury and Joe Davis suffered a loss of form, McDonald managed to build a solid centre-back partnership with John McCombe at the start of the 2012\u201313 campaign, but was warned to lose weight and improve his fitness by manager Micky Adams. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20132 win against Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn on 3 November, in the First Round of the FA Cup; during the match he also made a goal-line clearance with the score at 2\u20132. Speaking after the game, McDonald said \"I'm just trying to pay back the fans and the manager for all their support in the past with performances on the pitch. Hopefully it's the first of many... hopefully I can catch Tom Pope up. The support they have given me has meant a lot to me. They are a top bunch of people, it's a top area.\" However the arrival of new signings Darren Purse and Liam Chilvers displaced McDonald from the first team picture. On 21 January, he joined Bristol Rovers on loan until the end of the season, as cover for the injured Garry Kenneth. The \"Pirates\" were then bottom of the English Football League, and manager John Ward said that McDonald was \"prepared to come down for the cause [of avoiding relegation] and that's a really big plus for me.\" However McDonald remained on the bench as the \"Gas\" lost only three of their next 15 games, and had to wait until Tom Parkes received a suspension before he finally started a game for the club on 6 April, in a 1\u20130 win at the Memorial Stadium that saw Rovers climb into 11th place.

With 25 goals in the first six league games, Vale players found scoring goals easy, but the strength of the previous season \u2013 defending \u2013 seemed to have left them. In September, a brace from Rob Taylor and late winner from Pope were enough to beat Bradford City, as Vale climbed into the automatic promotion places. On 22 September 2011, Adams signed free agent Rob Kozluk on a short-term contract until 1 January 2012, and also brought in Liam Chilvers on a month's loan from Notts County (a loan deal later extended to 24 December); both players were signed to bolster Vale's struggling defence.

A day later and Vale travelled to Roots Hall and came away with a point following a goalless draw. Vale then went five league games without a win, after throwing away a two-goal lead for the second successive home game, to draw 2\u20132 with York City. Adams said \"It's not a time for people to criticise and get on the players' backs, so I'll have to put my arm around a few of them, even if I feel like strangling them at times.\" His team duly went on to record a simple 4\u20130 win over Bristol Rovers, with Pope's hat-trick taking him to 20 goals in the season. On 22 November, Liam Chilvers re-signed on loan from AFC Telford United in order to provide more options in defence. Notts County striker Lee Hughes was also reported to have joined the club on loan, with a view to a permanent move; however, the next day it was revealed that the loan move would not go through as the relevant paperwork had not been sent in to the Football League on time. Vale carried on scoring goals regardless, ending the month with a 3\u20131 win in miserable conditions at Aldershot Town. They also welcomed Calvin Andrew, who was signed to provide cover for Tom Pope.", "The new year was welcomed with a poor showing at home to Fleetwood, that ended in a 2\u20130 loss. There was good and bad news on 3 January, as Trinidad and Tobago international midfielder Chris Birchall was re-signed to the club as John McCombe was ruled out injured for \"at least six weeks\". Adams responded to the defeat to Fleetwood by making six changes at home to Plymouth, and was rewarded with a comprehensive 4\u20130 win over a struggling team reduced to ten men in the first half. He also signed experienced Argyle centre-back and captain Darren Purse. Gareth Owen and Darren Murphy both left the club, whilst veteran striker Lee Hughes was signed from Notts County. Liam Chilvers was also signed up until the end of the season. Both Purse and Hughes were handed debuts for the top of the table clash with Gillingham on 12 January, and played vital roles in the team's 2\u20131 victory. Adams then added another new face, with left-sided Sheffield Wednesday player Daniel Jones signed on until the end of the season.

Four days later, Vale hosted fourth placed Burton Albion, in what was labelled as the biggest game of the season for the \"Valiants\". Reduced tickets of \u00a39 ensured a crowd of 10,978, and they were treated to a comprehensive 7\u20131 victory as Lee Hughes scored a hat-trick. Bottom-placed Aldershot were the visitors four days later, and were seemingly fired up after manager Andy Scott took offense to Adams saying that \"[Aldershot] are down the bottom because [they] deserve to be\"; Scott stated that \"Sometimes managers say things to deflect from what is going on at their own club. We will find out if they have got the stomach for the fight and see if they want to get promoted as they have got a few clubs chasing them.\" The match proved to be low on action, and Vale surrendered a half-time lead to draw the game 1\u20131. On 12 April, it was confirmed that Burge had left the club by mutual consent. Vale could have won promotion the following day, and seemed to have done so after Liam Chilvers made amends for a horrific first half own goal by heading Vale into the lead on 89 minutes; however an injury-time equalizer left the Vale still just short of their final target. Automatic promotion was effectively secured with a 2\u20132 draw against Northampton Town on 20 April, the two unlikely goalscorers were Chilvers and former \"Valiant\" turned \"Cobbler\" Lee Collins.

His ban was later overturned and handed to Chris Lines, who had committed the tackle from behind which started the brawl in which Robertson had attempted to intervene as peacemaker. Vale went on to beat Walsall 1\u20130 with a controversial penalty and in doing so recorded their first double over Walsall in 114 years. Captain Loft and Dan Jones were ruled out of the Vale's next fixture after a training ground confrontation between the pair left Loft with a facial injury. Following a short investigation Jones was sacked by the club. This upheaval seemed not to affect the team as they went 2\u20130 up over Notts County at Meadow Lane, but then four goals without reply from County all but ended Vale's faint hopes of a play-off push. Vale then recorded their fourth straight home win after Jordan Hugill scored the only goal of the game against Milton Keynes Dons. A trip to third-place Rotherham ended with a 1\u20130 defeat, despite the hosts going down to ten men. In their final home game of the season, Vale let slip a one-goal lead to lose 2\u20131 to Sheffield United. The season ended with a 0\u20130 draw with Peterborough United at London Road. Three players were released in the summer: Anthony Griffith, Liam Chilvers and Rob Taylor, whilst Chris Shuker announced his retirement due to a chronic knee injury. Micky Adams elected to sign a new contract with the club, as did most of the club's out-of-contract players.
