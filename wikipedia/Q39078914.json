This was at the time the highest ever transfer between two British clubs as Juventus had paid Leeds United \u00a365,000 for John Charles in 1957. Aiming to use him as a centre forward, Arsenal manager George Swindin and captain Tommy Docherty managed to persuade Charles to take the move, and as Charles was convinced by the Arsenal men, Tottenham decided to withdraw their offer. Spurs manager Bill Nicholson was forced to sign Dave Mackay instead, as the White Hart Lane club would become a major force in the game in the 1960s. Due to this success, in his autobiography, Charles wrote that \"signing for Arsenal was the most terrible choice I ever made\". Though he also wrote that \"I'll always have a place in my heart for Arsenal, and it was an honour to have played for them.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Davies", "response": ["Peter Davies may refer to:", "*Peter Davies (rugby) (1925\u20132014), Welsh rugby player", "*Peter Davies (economic historian) (1927\u20132020), British economic historian", "*Peter Davies (politician) (born 1948), British politician, former mayor of Doncaster", "*Peter Davies (scientist) (born 1948), medical researcher", "*Peter Davies (born 1956), British participant in the Up Series documentaries", "*Peter Davies (Australian cricketer) (1957\u20132018), Australian cricketer", "*Peter Davies (artist) (born 1970), British painter", "*Peter Davies (English cricketer) (born 1976), English cricketer", "*Peter Davies (footballer, born 1936), Welsh footballer", "*Peter Davies (footballer, born 1942), Welsh footballer", "*Peter Davies (journalist) (active 1996\u20132011), South African journalist", "*Peter Davies (horse), thoroughbred racehorse", "*Troy Davies (Peter Davies, 1960\u20132007), Australian artist and musician"]}]}}
