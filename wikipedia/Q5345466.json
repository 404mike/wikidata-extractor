At midnight, the 1st Division began marching to the rendezvous point. Dawn on 23 February found the troops of the 1st Division at the selected crossing place on the south bank of the Adour. However, the luggers were nowhere in sight, having been blown out to sea by a contrary wind. Anxious that the French would discover his plans, Hope ordered Aylmer's and Campbell's brigades and Espa\u00f1a's division to launch probing attacks along Bayonne's southern front. These demonstrations completely fooled Thouvenot, who believed he was about to undergo a major assault. Meanwhile, 18-pounder long guns were mounted in the masked battery and when they opened fire, they drove off the French corvette Sapho and several gunboats. At 11:00 am, Hope boldly began sending his troops across the Adour, using five small boats. Securing a hawser to both banks, the British were able to send soldiers across in 50-man rafts. By 5:00 pm, five companies of British Guards and two companies of riflemen of the 5th/60th Foot were on the north bank with their brigade commander Edward Stopford. The French had 2,700 soldiers in Bayonne's citadel, but incredibly, Thouvenot made no serious attempt to wipe out the 500 British troops on the north bank. Instead, the citadel commander sent about 700 infantry to reconnoiter at dusk; these troops were hit by an accurate salvo of Congreve rockets and retreated."]}, {"page": "Edward Stopford", "response": ["Edward Stopford may refer to:", "*Edward Stopford (British Army officer) (1766\u20131837), Anglo-Irish soldier and politician", "*Edward Stopford (bishop) (died 1850), Bishop of Meath", "*Edward Stopford (priest) (1810\u20131874), Irish Anglican priest, son of the bishop"]}, {"page": "Battle of San Millan-Osma", "response": ["Sarrut's division was organized into two brigades under Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Fririon and Jean Baptiste Pierre Menne plus an artillery battery.
