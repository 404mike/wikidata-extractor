Colin Kidd wrote that in the United States, Christian Identity exploited \"the puzzle of the Ten Lost Tribes to justify an openly anti-Semitic and virulently racist agenda.\" According to Michael McFarland and Glenn Gottfried, they developed their racist interpretation of Christianity because of its status as a traditional religion of the United States, which allowed them to advocate the belief that white Americans have a common identity, and because of the variety of possible interpretations of the Bible in the field of hermeneutics."]}, {"page": "Lie", "response": ["* Mount, Ferdinand, \"Ruthless and Truthless\" (review of Peter Oborne, The Assault on Truth: Boris Johnson, Donald Trump and the Emergence of a New Moral Barbarism, Simon and Schuster, February 2021, , 192 pp.; and Colin Kidd and Jacqueline Rose, eds., Political Advice: Past, Present and Future, I.B.

As a geographical term, Sarmatia was always indistinct, but very stable. The presumed ancestors of the szlachta, the Sarmatians, were a confederacy of predominantly Iranian tribes living north of the Black Sea. In the 5th century BC Herodotus wrote that these tribes were descendants of the Scythians and Amazons. The Sarmatians were infiltrated by the Goths and others in the 2nd century AD, and may have had some strong and direct links to Poland.T. Sulimirski, The Sarmatians (New York: Praeger 1970) at 166\u2013167, 194, 196 (Sarmatian-Polish links). See below. The legend of Polish descent from Sarmatians stuck and grew until most of those within the Commonwealth, and many abroad, believed that many Polish nobles were somehow descendants of the Sarmatians (Sauromates). Another tradition came to surmise that the Sarmatians themselves were descended from Japheth, son of Noah.Colin Kidd, British Identities before Nationalism; Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600\u20131800, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 29"]}, {"page": "John Gardner (legal philosopher)", "response": ["*Obituary: John Gardner, internationally-renowned legal philosopher by Colin Kidd for The Herald (24 July 2019)"]}, {"page": "Race and appearance of Jesus", "response": ["In his book The Forging of Races, Colin Kidd argues that the assignment of race to biblical individuals has been a mostly subjective practice which is based on cultural stereotypes and societal trends rather than scientific methods.
