Harries (born 1963, in Pomona, California) is an artist and theorist of visual culture and media. After twenty years as a professor in Australia, England, and the U.S., and well known for his theories of parody, new media, postmodernism and the image, Harries began to put his teachings into practice and pursue his art full-time. In 2008, he established his studio, Harries + Fay\u00e9, in Hollywood's historic Artisan's Patio. His limited edition abstract photographs explore his theories of intertextuality and ambiguity. He currently exhibits his photographs at the Amy-Lauren Gallery on Kauai and at his studio.\nIn 1993, Harries began his academic career at Griffith University, in Brisbane, Australia, where he lectured in film and television studies. In 1994, he developed a film and media directory Web site, CineMedia, which in 1997 was nominated in the \"Film and Television\" category for the 1st Annual Webby Awards.

The first movie to be streamed was Charlie Chaplin's silent 1916 classic, \"The Rink.\" In 1998, Harries moved to London where he was head of the Visual Culture and Media Department at Middlesex University until 2003.\nHarries has a B.A in sociology from UCLA, an MA in Film Studies from the University of East Anglia, and a PhD from UCLA in Film & Television.
