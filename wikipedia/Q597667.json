He is a highly influential 'musical sound designer' in Hollywood having worked on many blockbuster films, yet his sound is often hard to describe or even identify. He is probably best known for his collaboration work with Hans Zimmer and has contributed with both ambient music design and music to some of last decades biggest Hollywood blockbusters. He has also made numerous production music CDs for Extreme Music which loosely feature some of the atmospheric textures in his world of ambient music design.\nOn the Inception premiere in Hollywood, Wesson and Zimmer designed an outdoor sound installation using the atmosphere and soundscapes from the movie itself, exclusively for the audience. In Wesson's own words: \"Hans wanted the audience to remain within the Inception dreamscape as they left the LA Inception Premiere. In order to achieve this I put together a 40-minute soundscape designed to surround the audience as they followed the mirrored walkway from the Gaumans Chinese Theatre in Hollywood to the nearby after-show reception. The soundscape comprised of ambience from the movie, together with a few well chosen FX from Inception sound designer Richard King.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Mel Wesson"]}, {"page": "James Newton Howard", "response": ["| Soundtrack released by Var\u00e8se SarabandeComposed with Mel Wesson"]}, {"page": "Ocean Drive (album)", "response": ["*Mel Wesson \u00a0\u2013 programming"]}, {"page": "Remote Control Productions (American company)", "response": ["*  Mel Wesson"]}, {"page": "Infamous (video game)", "response": ["The soundtrack is composed by the electronic musician Amon Tobin, composers James Dooley and Mel Wesson, and electric cellist Martin Tillman, under the direction of Sony's music manager, Jonathan Mayer. Tobin was specifically brought on board due to his recent trend of blurring the lines between music and sound design as exhibited in his then-recent album, Foley Room. Instead of using traditional instruments, the team sought to use sounds that results from objects that would be found in an urban environment and using such objects in combination with other instruments used in non-traditional manners; for example, bungee cords were strung alongside a bass drum and strummed, and wire brushes were hit against a suspended tuba. The music was divided between Tobin, who worked on the in-game music, and Dooley who worked on the music for the cinematics; the two worked together to make sure common musical themes were present in both aspects. Tillman was brought in late to the process to add the cello sounds, but the group was so impressed with his work that they remixed already-completed pieces to incorporate his contribution further. Manchester music group, Working for a Nuclear Free City were commissioned by Sony to produce a song for the game. The song was penned \"Silent Melody\" and was used in one of the game's promotional trailers. The soundtrack was released for digital download from the iTunes Store in May 2009."]}, {"page": "My Winter Storm", "response": ["* Mel Wesson - ambient music design and electronic arrangements"]}, {"page": "Mission: Impossible 2 \u2013 Music from the Motion Picture Score", "response": ["*Mel Wesson"]}, {"page": "Black Hawk Down (soundtrack)", "response": ["Black Hawk Down is the soundtrack accompanying the 2001 film of the same name.
