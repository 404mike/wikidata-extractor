In 2019, when asked on Twitter about when the album would be released, Reid replied: \"I'd speculate sooner rather than later and when the time is right.\" Neil told NME in May 2020 that they have been close to finishing the new record \"for about two years\u201d and were due to finish it in March but were set back by the UK coronavirus lockdown.", "Live, the group consists JP Reid (vocals, guitar) and Simon Neil (vocals, synth, guitar and bass).
