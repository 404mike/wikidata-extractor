He sometimes captained the team in the absence of the regular captains Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg. He was also known as a good fielder in the covers.Educated at Repton, Barnwell first appeared for Somerset in 1935, and played 11 matches the following year, though with a highest score of 38 he made little impact. In 1937, he played only seven games, but passed 50 for the first time with 73 in the match against Gloucestershire at Taunton.In 1938 and 1939, and again in the first post-war season of 1946, Barnwell appeared in more than half Somerset's first-class matches, although he failed to top 400 runs in any season. In 1938, batting at No 9, he made an unbeaten 49 and shared a partnership for the eighth wicket of 143 with Longrigg which was a county record until beaten by Viv Richards and Ian Botham in 1983. His best season was 1939, when he made 396 runs, including his career-best of 83 against Hampshire at Taunton.After the 1946 season, Barnwell was allegedly offered the captaincy of Somerset, but turned it down, and appeared for the county only once more, in 1948.\nHis career outside cricket was as a farmer, breeding silver foxes for the fur trade. According to another account by the same author, he \"personified the 'old school', a debonair amateur... Rightly proud of his nimbleness in the covers and the four boundaries in a row he once audaciously took off Voce at Trent Bridge.\"His nephew, Michael Barnwell, played cricket for Cambridge University, Somerset and Eastern Province in the 1960s and 1970s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fivehead", "response": ["* John Barnwell \u2013 Somerset cricketer died in the village in 1998."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Barnwell (1935\u20131948) 69 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Michael Barnwell", "response": ["A nephew of John Barnwell, who played cricket for Somerset before and after the Second World War, Michael Barnwell was educated at Repton and Christ's College, Cambridge."]}, {"page": "John Barnwell (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Barnwell (born 1938) is an English football player and manager", "John Barnwell may also refer to:", "*John Barnwell (colonist) (1671\u20131724), Irish-born settler of South Carolina, an Indian-fighter known as \"Tuscarora Jack\"", "*John Barnwell (cricketer) (1914\u20131998), English cricketer", "*John Barnwell (senator) (1748\u20131800), American soldier and public official from South Carolina during the American Revolution"]}, {"page": "Bunty Longrigg", "response": ["In 1937, Longrigg played for Somerset more often, turning out in 11 matches and captaining the side on occasion in the absence of the regular captain, his fellow Bath solicitor Reggie Ingle. At the end of the season, amid some disgruntlement about the side's lack of drive under the amiable Ingle, Longrigg was appointed captain for the 1938 season. The move, Wisden reported in 1939, was a success: Somerset won 10 Championship matches for the first time ever and rose six places up the table to finish seventh. It wrote: \"Better team-work played an important part in Somerset's achievements, and in this connection they owed much to E. F. Longrigg... if he did not altogether fulfil expectations as a batsman, he certainly left no doubts concerning his qualifications for leadership. Those who closely followed the county's fortunes were impressed by his tact and judgment as well as keenness which often manifested itself.\" The personal highlight of the season was an unbeaten 187 against Gloucestershire at Bristol, and he added an unbroken 143 in 90 minutes for the eighth wicket with John Barnwell that was the Somerset record for the wicket until beaten by 172 by Viv Richards and Ian Botham in 1983."]}, {"page": "Trevor Jones (cricketer)", "response": ["Jones made his first-class debut in the match against Nottinghamshire at Taunton in June 1938 while still at school and in his first innings, batting at No 8, he made 40 and put on 60 with John Barnwell, the highest stand of the innings.
