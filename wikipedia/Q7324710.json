He notably worked for the Henty Brothers, who established the first permanent Victorian settlement in Portland, upon his arrival in Australia. Richard ultimately settled in Charam, near Edenhope, in Victoria and raised 13 children, most of whom lived to their 80s and 90s. When he died at the age of 97, Richard left a strong legacy in Australia in the form of his contributions to the fledgling colony and his hundreds of descendants.", "link_mentions": {}}}
