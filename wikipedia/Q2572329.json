He signed for Aston Villa as a seventeen-year-old and played in the Villa side for two decades, scoring 170 goals in 392 games. (The total including wartime matches was over 200 goals.)

He later returned to Villa as a director, the only person to do this at the club. He had 4 children. Often referred to as Mr Aston Villa in recognition of his long standing service and contribution to the club. In 2006 the club announced the creation of an Aston Villa Hall of Fame. This was voted for by fans and the inaugural induction saw 12 former players, managers and directors named. Eric Houghton was chosen.He also played seven first-class matches as a right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler for Warwickshire County Cricket Club (1946\u20131947) and also minor counties cricket for Lincolnshire County Cricket Club. He also played club cricket for Sleaford, Aston Unity and Olton Cricket Clubs.\nHis brother, Roy Houghton, and cousin, Reg Goodacre, were also footballers.

George Ramsay retired in 1926, at the age of 71, his replacement Billy Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success, although the club did finish runners-up in the league twice under his guidance, with 128 goals scored in the 1930\u201331 season, which remains the all-time top-flight record to the present day. A remarkable 49 of the league goals that season were scored by centre-forward Tom 'Pongo' Waring, with another 30 goals from winger Eric Houghton. Villa struggled in the 1935\u201336 season, largely due to a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenal's Ted Drake in an infamous 1\u20137 defeat at Villa Park.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 71. The club made seven signings and spent a staggering sum for the time of \u00a335,500 trying to retain top-flight status at all costs, but were unable to buy their way out of trouble. Aston Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, was relegated in 1936 for the first time in its history. ", "Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956\u201357 season when another former Villa player, Eric Houghton led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of Manchester United 2-1 with Northern Irish winger Peter McParland scoring both goals.Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; pp. 86\u201387. The team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later, due in large part to complacency. However, under the stewardship of manager Joe Mercer Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions with a talented young side which became known as 'Mercer's Minors'. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the Football League Cup with England centre-forward Gerry Hitchens scoring an impressive 42 goals in 1960-61 .Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 93.", "*  Eric Houghton", "|Eric Houghton"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Eric Houghton"]}, {"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["He formed a productive forward partnership with Jackie Sewell in the 1948\u201349 campaign, and scored 23 goals in 40 league and cup appearances. County finished in mid-table despite scoring 102 goals, 15 more than champions Swansea. Stollery was sacked and upon Lawton's suggestion the club appointed Eric Houghton as manager after Lawton turned down the role as player-manager. Lawton and Sewell's understanding grew throughout the 1949\u201350 campaign, and Lawton finished as the division's top-scorer with 31 goals in 37 league games as County won promotion as champions, seven points ahead of second-placed Northampton Town. Promotion was secured with a 2\u20130 win over local rivals Nottingham Forest at Meadow Lane on 22 April."]}]}}
