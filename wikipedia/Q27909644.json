The group shot it while on tour in Australia in mid-2004, at the same studio space used by the Wiggles. It features Australian pop singer Sophie Monk. The video is displayed as three horizontal panels, in which Monk flirts with DeLonge, Hoppus and Barker. However, the panels sever the onscreen participants in three. Monk appears as a fractured whole, while parts of the band members combine to make one character. The trio's characters attempt to plead with Monk, trying to repair a damaged relationship, which are depicted through fights, arguments, and \"the occasional making-up/making-out,\" which is handled by Barker.Shooman, 2010. pp. 135-136 In reference to the video, DeLonge said \"It's like doing an algebraic formulation on paper when you watch it. It's the same kind of feeling [...] but it's rad.\" Bassist Mark Hoppus called it the most technically complicated video the band ever had to shoot, as it required choreographed positioning in real time. The video was photographed by Brad Rushing and edited by David Blackburn who won the MVPA Best Editing Award for his work."]}, {"page": "Toxic (song)", "response": ["The music video for \"Toxic\" was filmed on a sound-stage in Los Angeles. It was directed by Joseph Kahn, who had previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single \"Stronger\". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited \"Womanizer\" and \"Do Somethin'. Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, for which Kahn created a treatment. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, including for example the scene in which she drops a drink on the passenger's lap. Spears said she wanted to join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the \"common man\" would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was \"not sure what I was thinking about when she told me about that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it.\" The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different, strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger on whom Spears drops a drink was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's ex-boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque."]}, {"page": "We Are All Made of Stars", "response": ["The song's music video, directed by Joseph Kahn, edited by David Blackburn and photographed by Brad Rushing, points out the excesses of the typical \"Hollywood\" lifestyle, showing celebrities in seedy environments, while Moby, an outsider to that world, portrays a spaceman.

Kabukiman N.Y.P.D., and Robert Evans. The atmosphere of the video was inspired by photographs by Philip-Lorca diCorcia. The theme and some of the imagery also derives from the 1968 film and novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, particularly the Star Child motif (\"We are all stars\") and Moby's appearance throughout much of the video wearing a space suit."]}, {"page": "Chrysalis Heart", "response": ["A music video was directed by Jose Ho-Guanipa. with cinematography by Brad Rushing and editing by David Blackburn."]}, {"page": "David Blackburn", "response": ["David Blackburn may refer to:", "* David Blackburn (artist) (1939\u20132016), British landscape artist", "* David Blackburn (footballer) (born 1956), Australian rules footballer", "* David Blackburn (speedway rider) (born 1962), British motorcycle speedway rider", "* David Blackburn (Royal Navy officer) (1753\u20131795)", "* David Blackburn (film editor) (born 1967), British film editor"]}, {"page": "David Blackburn (editor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Blackburn (film editor)"]}]}}
