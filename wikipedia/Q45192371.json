By 1964, the condition in adults became popularly known as perioral dermatitis, but without clear clinical criteria. In 1970, the condition was recognised in children. That all rashes around the mouth are perioral dermatitis has since been frequently debated. That this condition should be renamed periorificial dermatitis has been proposed.
