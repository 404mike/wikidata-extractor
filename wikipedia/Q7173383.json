In 1961 he joined the BBC World Service as a Technical Operator in the Control Room at Bush House, undertaking recording operations on disk and tape as well as Control Room routing. In 1964 he became a Studio Manager - operating studio mixing desks and playback equipment - at Broadcasting House, moving on to the BBC Regional studios at Bristol in 1966 where he eventually became the principal Film Dubbing Mixer, responsible for, among many other things, the final mix on David Attenborough's wildlife series Life on Earth.\nDuring this time he also ran a small disc-cutting business as a sideline under the name Gosport Sound Products (he grew up in Gosport, Hampshire) - initially in his flat at Anerley, South London, and then in a small office in Bristol - doing long-playing disc copies of private recordings such as weddings (this was before the advent of cheap tape and cassette recorders) and disk mastering for subsequent pressings to be made. \nAs BBC Bristol was the home of the Natural History Unit, he developed an interest in making birdsong and wildlife recordings: he once paid for a holiday in Australia by recording wildlife atmospheres during it and selling them to the BBC Sound Archive.In 1986 he left the BBC and took up the post of Conservation Manager and later become the Head of Sound Conservation at the National Sound Archive (now part of the British Library) which essentially performs much the same functions for sound recordings as the Library does for books and other publications. He was instrumental in effecting the move to digital archiving using the new techniques which were becoming available: he also did extensive research into the highly specialized and complex area of accurate reproduction of old recordings - he probably knew more about the technical history of sound recording than anyone in the country.\nHe retired from the NSA (by then called the British Library Sound Archive) in 2002 on reaching the age of 60, but continued to act as a consultant until his death from a diabetes-related heart attack on 30 July 2006. He was still working on a Manual of Analogue Sound Restoration Techniques - a mammoth opus with sections on conversion to digital formats, noise reduction, correct methods of playing and equalizing 78rpm and other old recordings: the British Library has published this manual electronically on its website. His huge collection of rare and unusual gramophone records and other sound recordings has been donated to the British Library Sound Archive.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Phonograph record", "response": ["* Sound Recordings by Peter Copeland published 1991 by the British Library ."]}, {"page": "British Library Sound Archive", "response": ["*Peter Copeland Conservation Manager of the National Sound Archive/British Library Sound Archive from 1986 to 2002."]}, {"page": "Compact disc bronzing", "response": ["PDO acknowledged that the problem was due to a manufacturing error on its part, but it gave different explanations for the problem. The most widely acknowledged explanation is that the lacquer used to coat the discs was not resistant to the sulfur content of the paper in the booklets, which led to the corrosion of the aluminium layer of the disc, even though PDO later said it was because \"a silver coating had been used on its discs instead of the standard gold.\" Peter Copeland of the British Library Sound Archive confirmed that silver instead of aluminium in the reflective layer of the CD would react with sulfur compounds in the sleeves, forming silver sulfate, which has a bronze colour. A combination of the two factors seems likely because, as Barbara Hirsch of the University of California points out, the oxidation could only have occurred if the protective lacquer did not seal the metal film and substrate well enough."]}, {"page": "Roger Wilmut", "response": ["Wilmut's enthusiasm for the Goons led to the first of his books. In 1974, with the help of friends Tim Smith and Peter Copeland, he revised a list of the series' episodes supplied by the BBC, and his own earlier research, into a  \"much more complete typewritten list\". He then sent it to Robson Books, who showed an interest. While writing the accompanying text he was \"approached by the late Jimmy Grafton, who had been involved with the Goons in their early days, and had helped to get the show on the air. He suggested combining his memoirs with my book, and this is what happened, with the book being published in 1976 under the title The Goon Show Companion.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Michael Copeland", "response": ["#redirectPeter Copeland"]}, {"page": "Peter M.
