Cooper was undefeated in British and Commonwealth heavyweight championship contests for twelve years, and held the European heavyweight title for three years. In 1966 he fought Ali, by then world heavyweight champion, a second time and was again stopped  due to a cut. Cooper twice was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year, and after retiring in 1971 following a controversial loss remained a popular public figure. He is the only boxer to have been awarded a knighthood.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 1", "response": ["*2011 \u2013 Henry Cooper, English boxer (b. 1934)"]}, {"page": "May 3", "response": ["*1934 \u2013 Henry Cooper, English boxer and sportscaster (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "1934", "response": ["** Henry Cooper, British boxer (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "2011", "response": ["* May 1 \u2013 Henry Cooper, British heavyweight boxer (b. 1934)"]}, {"page": "Cockney", "response": ["*Henry Cooper, boxer, born in Lambeth"]}, {"page": "Muhammad Ali", "response": ["Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker.
