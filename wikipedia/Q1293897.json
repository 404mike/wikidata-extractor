This was the transit theodolite. This type of theodolite was developed from 18th century astronomical Transit instruments used to measure accurate star positions. The technology was transferred to theodolites in the early 19th century by instrument makers such as Edward Troughton and William Simms and became the standard theodolite design. Development of the theodolite was spurred on by specific needs. In the 1820s progress on national surveying projects such as the Ordnance Survey in Britain produced a requirement for theodolites capable of providing sufficient accuracy for large scale triangulation and mapping. The Survey of India at this time produced a requirement for more rugged and stable instruments such as the Everest pattern theodolite with its lower centre of gravity."]}, {"page": "Troughton", "response": ["* Edward Troughton (1753\u20141835), British instrument maker", "* Troughton & Simms, company founded by Edward Troughton"]}, {"page": "John Pond", "response": ["In 1800 Pond settled at Westbury near Bristol, and began to determine star-places with a fine altitude and azimuth circle of  in diameter by Edward Troughton.

A final corrected edition was later published in 1838 under the auspices of George Biddell Airy. In his later career he worked on establishing a standard of length for imperial measures.
