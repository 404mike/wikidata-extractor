He is mainly known for work in molecular reaction dynamics and photofragment-ion imaging. He is also associated with some of the early chemical applications of the web with Henry Rzepa. As of 2021, he is on the executive committee of Scientists for Labour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Benjamin Whitaker", "response": ["*Benjamin J.

SfL tried to lobby the Labour Party before the 1997 UK general election to pledge the creation of a cabinet level secretary of science, something that it was unsuccessful in doing, though it is still a policy that the group supports. During the 2000s, the group submitted evidence on science policy to the Science and Technology Select Committee. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the organisation began to publish regular reports on th science around COVID-19, including both daily briefings and long form reports. These reports have earned SfL public praise from prominent Labour figures including the Leader of the Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer KCB QC MP, and former Prime Minister Dr. Gordon Brown HonFRSE. These reports have been on topics such as the impact of COVID-19 on BAME communities in the U.K., the handling Scottish government's handling of COVID-19, the importance of ensuring that research can continue in spite of pandemic conditions, the importance of the transparency in government scientific advice, and the importance of maintaining links with European scientists both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Members of the executive committee as of April 2021 include the chemical physicist Benjamin J. Whitaker and the politician and teacher Martin Whitfield."]}]}}
