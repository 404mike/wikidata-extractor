Furie and written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal from a story by Christopher Reeve, Konner, and Rosenthal based on the DC Comics character Superman. The film stars Reeve, Gene Hackman, Jackie Cooper, Marc McClure, Jon Cryer, Sam Wanamaker, Jim Broadbent, Mariel Hemingway, and Margot Kidder.\nIt is the fifth film in the Superman film series and a sequel to Superman III (1983). It is the first film in the series to not have the involvement of producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind. The film also marks the final appearance of Reeve as Superman, who agreed to return in exchange for a large salary and a story promoting nuclear disarmament.Shortly before the film's production, the film's producer, The Cannon Group, suffered a major financial crisis that forced major budget cuts, and 40 minutes of footage were deleted after negative test screenings. Upon release, it was widely lambasted by critics and fans alike, with many reviewers citing poor special effects, inconsistencies, and plot holes. Superman IV has often been named one of the worst films ever made. No further Superman films were released until Superman Returns in 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1987 in film", "response": ["| Superman IV: The Quest for Peace || Warner Bros.

Despised by fans and critics alike, it is the lowest-grossing film in the series, only taking in $15,681,020 at the North American box office. Many critics pointed out the film's poor screenplay, acting, and special effects (such as a scene in which Superman repairs the Great Wall of China with his super-vision), while some have criticized it for its lack of attention to the comic book source material. Such special effects led Rita Kempley of The Washington Post to call it \"one of the cheesiest movies ever made\". Film critic Jeffrey Lyles voiced similar hatred, claiming that the film \"isn't just one of the worst comic book films, it's one of the worst films ever made\". Superman IV holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 44 reviews. It appears on Empire list of the 50 worst movies of all time, as well as the Movie Review Query Engine's (MRQE) 50 Worst Movies list and Screen Rants list of the 25 worst films ever made. The film was nominated for two Razzies at the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Supporting Actress (Mariel Hemingway) and Worst Visual Effects."]}, {"page": "The Alaska Kid", "response": ["The Alaska Kid is a 1991 German-Russian-Polish television miniseries, based on Jack London's 1912 short story anthology, Smoke Bellew.
