On the 20th lap of the 2012 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen had just taken the lead from Lewis Hamilton and his race engineer Simon Rennie advised that Fernando Alonso was five seconds behind and that he would be kept informed of Alonso's pace; R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen replied, \"Just leave me alone, I know what to do!\" Later in the same race, he admonished his team again, when being told to manage the tyre temperature: \"Yes, yes, yes, yes, I'm doing that all the time. You don't have to remind me every ten seconds!\" The first quote attracted significant press coverage, and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen made no attempt to apologise in the post-race interview. It was earlier reported that he printed 500 T-shirts with the quote for the entire Lotus team, but this was later denied by R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen in an interview with Formula One Group media personnel. The quote was featured on his official website."]}, {"page": "Mark Webber (racing driver)", "response": ["Webber remained at Red Bull for the  championship: he wanted to honour an earlier promise he had made to Horner and Mateschitz to stay at the team until his F1 career was over. He rejected an offer from Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali to partner Alonso and replace Felipe Massa for a year with a second optional, feeling switching teams would be inappropriate. He briefly lightened his training over the pre-season period when a titanium rod in his right leg was removed in December 2012. After restarting training that month, Webber decided to retire from F1 after 2013 because he wanted to spend more time with his family, demotivation with F1 since drivers could not criticise Pirelli's tyres for fear of possibly upsetting others and the politics when large sums of money were involved. Webber was assigned Simon Rennie as his race engineer when his previous engineer, Ciaron Pilbeam, became the Lotus team's chief race engineer. "]}]}}
