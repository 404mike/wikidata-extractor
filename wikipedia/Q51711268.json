Thomas was a silk dyer who was later knighted for his services to the silk industry and Elizabeth was a skilled English embroider.\u00a0 Thomas gave Elizabeth strands of tussar silk and asked her to devise a new form of embroidery in the hopes that it would encourage needlewomen to use his silks. Thomas wished to expand his silk dyeing business by dyeing fibre which he had sourced in India. He promoted tussar silk to the Leek embroiders and imported tussar silk in woven form however, the Leek embroiders were only interested in the dyed yarns as this was more suitable for embroidery thread. Thomas\u2019s wife Elizabeth developed a form of embroidery and art needlework using the tussar silk and so began the Leek Embroidery Society. Elizabeth was a supporter of the Art Needlework method and wanted the Society to promote art embroidery. Elizabeth has been called a leading practitioner of the art, inspired by the likes of William Morris. She knew Morris through her husband, Thomas Wardle, who worked with Morris developing natural vegetable dyes. The Leek Embroidery Society's work was representative of the Arts and Crafts movement, of which Morris was a leading figure.", "The Society\u2019s work was in demand until around 1900 and was sold in Wardle\u2019s shop in New Bond Street, William Morris\u2019s shop in Oxford Street, Liberty & Co in Regent Street and at Debenham & Freebody, off Oxford Street. Elizabeth Wardle died in 1902, and the society\u2019s output rapidly declined. Products which made use of the society\u2019s designs continued to be sold in the Leek shop until it was closed in the 1930s."]}]}}
