Botfield's 1828 patent seems to have anticipated most of the elements of the blast furnace as it was used in the 1830s and 1840s.His father was Thomas Botfield (1738\u20131801) who acquired a fortune from collieries and iron manufacture. Thomas Botfield, the younger, born at Dawley, Shropshire, in 1762, was educated at the endowed school of Cleobury Mortimer. He worked as a colliery manager and married in 1800. Seated at Hopton Court in Hopton Wafers, whose manor he purchased in 1812, he funded the rebuilding of Hopton's parish church in 1825. He served as High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1818He was elected F.R.S. on 18 April 1833.\n\nHe was one of the original members of the Geological Society, and early a fellow of the Society of Arts.
