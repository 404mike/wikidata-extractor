Fourth cap on 6 December 1997 at Twickenham when facing legendary Jonah Lomu.  With about 5 minutes gone, New Zealand won a penalty in their own 22.  The All black fly-half Andrew Mehrtens kicked cross-field and found Rees on his right wing.  Rees counter-attacked, chipped over the head of Lomu.  He collected the ball, sidestepped round Zinzan Brooke's cover tackle and scored in the corner.  The try sparked England on to a 23-9 half-time lead, though the All Blacks fought back in the second half with the match ending in a 26-26 draw.\nHe also scored two tries against Wales in a 1998 Five Nations Championship game.In 1999 he moved to Bristol, and moved to Leeds Tykes in 2003 after Bristol were relegated.
