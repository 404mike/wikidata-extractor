His father became a much revered Commissioner in the Army's ranks, and travelled extensively in the interests of the organisation. His mother died when he was 8 years of age.\nHe became an officer in 1882 at the age of 17. Most of his earlier career was spent as an officer in the United States. During his time as an officer in the U.S., there was great divisions amongst the American Salvationists. He was known as the peace maker, thus earning him a lot of respect. In 1888, he married Captain Catherine Price.\nWhen Higgins was 42 years of age, Commissioner and Chief of the Staff  Bramwell Booth gave him the oversight of the evangelistic work in the United Kingdom. By this time, Higgins was a great speaker, and had a lot of leadership skills which was needed in this role.\nThe Siege of London was a 10-day effort that took place in November 1912. It was an attempt to bring a prayer service to the people out in the core of London. It was such a huge success that it was repeated in 1913.In 1919, General Bramwell Booth appointed him as his Chief of the Staff. Higgins was never one to lead a political agenda, but he took his new role in stride. However, 1929 was a real test for Higgins and a critical time in the history of The Salvation Army, the calling of the first High Council to elect a new General. General Bramwell Booth was asked to resign because of his ill health over the past several months. He refused, however, and was then reluctantly deposed from office, to be succeeded in the election of Higgins. As General Booth sued, the matter was put in the hands of the court. The court ruled in favour of the High Council. Thus, Higgins was the first General to be elected by the High Council.As leader of the International Salvation Army, General Higgins still had his personal touch and warmth towards others. During his term in office as the General, he allowed a centenary of William Booth's birth to be celebrated. He also presided over a gathering in the Royal Albert Hall, and among those taking part was then Prime Minister, The Rt Hon. Stanley Baldwin.\nWhen he retired, his farewell meeting was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 1 November 1934, presided over by the then Duke of York (later George VI), who was accompanied by the Duchess (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.)\nThe General and his wife then went to live in Florida, and later moved to Canada. The General and his wife had 7 children. He continued to prove himself a true \"son of the Army\" by maintaining as much interest in the relatively small corps around them as he had done in the greater issues when in office.\tMrs General Catherine Higgins died in 1952.\nHiggins wrote a number of books, including Stewards of God and Personal Holiness.\nGeneral Edward Higgins died at age 83.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 14", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Edward Higgins, English-American 3rd General of The Salvation Army (b. 1864)"]}, {"page": "November 26", "response": ["*1864 \u2013 Edward Higgins, English 3rd General of the Salvation Army (d. 1947)"]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["** Edward Higgins, General of The Salvation Army (b. 1864)"]}, {"page": "Highbridge, Somerset", "response": ["Edward Higgins (General of the Salvation Army in the early 1930s) was born in Church Street, and lends his name to a development of elderly persons dwellings near the town centre."]}, {"page": "General of The Salvation Army", "response": ["| Edward Higgins"]}, {"page": "High Council of The Salvation Army", "response": ["After over two months of deliberations, the court ruled in favour of the High Council.

These two officers later became Generals of The Salvation Army. There is some debate whether or not the disagreement was with Bramwell himself or his speechwriter, Commissioner Cornelius Obadiah Phelps.  Commissioner Phelps was hand selected to lead a team of accountants to the United States to collect overdue missions funding.  As a result of the affair, Higgins and Carpenter became somewhat distant from Booth.  Another notable Army leader that disagreed with Bramwell's leadership was Commissioner Charles Jeffries who would later be British Commissioner. In his final years as General he increasingly gave control of The Salvation Army to his wife, Florence Booth, who was given power of attorney when he was away travelling. She had been the Army's 'First Lady' since the death of his mother Catherine Booth in 1890, and had started several Army organisations including the Home League, Girl Guards, and League of Mercy.", "As the years passed the Army's senior officers, including Bramwell's sister Evangeline Booth and his former brother-in-law Frederick Booth-Tucker, began to question his leadership. In May 1928 Bramwell's health began to deteriorate, and by September he was suffering from insomnia and depression. His poor health offered those in the Army who were dissatisfied with his leadership an opportunity to act, and on 8 January 1929 the first High Council of The Salvation Army convened, and firstly asked the General to resign due to his ill health, which, they said, was hampering him in the performance of his duties and decisions. He refused to resign, believing that his health would soon be fully recovered, so on 13 February 1929 the High Council voted by 52 votes to 5 that Bramwell's term of office as General should now end, based on Bramwell being 'unfit' to hold the position. Booth was succeeded in the election of Edward Higgins, his Chief of the Staff."]}, {"page": "Edward J.
