J. Varley's excavations. After graduating she worked as a wartime postal censor and freelance photojournalist, whilst continuing to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain. In 1956, Jones began working for the Ministry of Works as a freelance archaeologist in the burgeoning field of rescue archaeology. She worked at a number of sites, but is best known for her excavations at Mucking, a major Anglo-Saxon settlement and associated cemetery, with finds ranging from the Stone Age to the Medieval period.\nThe Mucking excavation, which Jones directed from 1965 to 1978, became Britain's largest ever archaeological excavation. It produced an unprecedented volume of material, although some academic archaeologists have criticised the fact that the results did not appear in print until decades after the excavation had ended. Jones' work at Mucking, as well as her role in founding the campaign group Rescue, was influential in the establishment of modern commercial archaeology in Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Margaret Ursula Jones (1916\u20132001) British; Mucking,  England"]}, {"page": "Rescue \u2013 The British Archaeological Trust", "response": ["Rescue \u2013 The British Archaeological Trust is a charitable organisation in the United Kingdom.

Covering an area of 18 hectares (44 acres), at the time it was the largest archaeological excavation in Europe, and is the largest excavation ever undertaken in the British Isles. Excavation continued year-round to stay ahead of gravel extraction that was rapidly destroying the site, accumulating an \"astonishing\" volume of material. Only a fraction of this was analysed or published in Jones' lifetime, and ultimately the bulk of the post-excavation work was left to others. The first volume of a \"full publication\" was not published until 2015, by which point the post-excavation phase had cost significantly more than the initial excavation. This led some to criticise Mucking as an irresponsible, \"excavation without publication\"."]}, {"page": "May 1916", "response": ["* Born: Margaret Ursula Jones, British archaeologist, best known for the exploration of the Mucking site in southern England, in Birkenhead, England (d. 2001); Ephraim Katzir, Ukrainian-Israeli state leader, 4th President of Israel, in Kiev (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "List of female scientists in the 20th century", "response": ["* Margaret Ursula Jones (1916\u20132001), British archaeologist best known for directing Britain's largest archaeological excavation at Mucking, Essex"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2001", "response": ["*Margaret Ursula Jones, 84, British archaeologist, known for directing excavations at Mucking, Essex."]}, {"page": "Margaret Ursula Owen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Margaret Ursula Jones"]}]}}
