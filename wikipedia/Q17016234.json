In his Inquiry Concerning Virtue (1699), Shaftesbury had postulated that the moral sense in humans is natural and innate and based on feelings, rather than resulting from the indoctrination of a particular religion. Shaftesbury was reacting to Thomas Hobbes's justification of an absolutist central state in his Leviathan, \"Chapter XIII\", in which Hobbes famously holds that the state of nature is a \"war of all against all\" in which men's lives are \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\". Hobbes further calls the Native Americans an example of a contemporary people living in such a state. Although writers since antiquity had described people living in conditions outside contemporary definitions of \"civilization\", Hobbes is credited with inventing the term \"State of Nature\". Ross Harrison writes that \"Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term.\"Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece, Ross Harrison, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 70."]}, {"page": "Quain Professor", "response": ["*Ross Harrison (2006\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "List of provosts of King's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Ross Harrison"]}, {"page": "Ross Harrison (philosopher)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ross Harrison (academic)"]}, {"page": "Ross Harrison", "response": ["Ross Harrison may refer to:", "*Ross Harrison (academic) (born 1943), British philosopher and academic", "*Ross Harrison (rugby union) (born 1992), British rugby union player"]}]}}
