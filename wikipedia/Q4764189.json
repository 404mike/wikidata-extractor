Following education at Eton College, he briefly entered business as a merchant banker with Morgan Grenfell. He subsequently moved to the United States of America, where he worked for Chiswell Langhorne constructing railways in Virginia. McDonnell became a close friend of Langhorne's daughter Nancy Astor.With the outbreak of the First World War, he served with the railway troops reserve of the 1st Canadian Division, constructing railways behind the lines of the Western Front, rising to the rank of colonel.He returned to the United Kingdom, where he was chosen by the Conservative Party to contest the constituency of Dartford at the 1924 general election. He won the seat, narrowly defeating the sitting Labour Party Member of Parliament, John Edmund Mills. McDonnell had little interest in parliament, and did not defend the seat in 1929, returning to his business activities.When America entered the Second World War in 1941, McDonnell was appointed Honorary Attach\u00e9 to Washington where he was able to use his personal and business contacts to assist Lord Halifax, British Ambassador to the United States.He married actress Ethelwyne Sylvia Arthur Jones, the daughter of dramatist Henry Arthur Jones, on 13 December 1913.

On hearing of the death of a political enemy, she expressed her pleasure. When people complained, she did not apologise but said, \"I'm a Virginian; we shoot to kill.\" Angus McDonnell, a Virginia friend, angered her by marrying without consulting her on his choice. She later told him, regarding his maiden speech, that he \"really must do better than that.\" During the course of her adult life, Astor alienated many with her sharp words as well.Sykes (1984), pp. 285, 326Masters (1981), p. 58"]}, {"page": "Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax", "response": ["Halifax's cousin Angus McDonnell helped him find his feet, and he soon led a very effective propaganda effort.
