In fact, the composer and the performers were pseudonyms of BBC producers Hans Keller and Susan Bradshaw, who concocted the deliberately unmusical percussive piece as a hoax.  According to Bradshaw, \"It was a serious hoax to set people thinking that fake music can be indistinguishable from the genuine.\"http://www.langston.com/Fun_People/1993/1993AMD.html The success of the hoax, however, is open to question.  While Mobile for Tape and Percussion was reviewed seriously by several critics, all of the reviews were roundly negative, with the piece being almost instantly identified as a \"non-musical\" studio prank.; ; ", "Nearly two months after the event, a BBC spokesman denied that the work was a hoax, describing it instead as an \"experiment\", in which \"the percussion instruments on the tape were played at random. I imagine that Piotr Zak does not exist. But we did not hoax the listeners. It was an experiment\". A conflicting report published the next day claimed that the BBC confessed the entire programme had been a hoax. It was revealed that the piece had been produced by Hans Keller and Susan Bradshaw at the BBC. By striking randomly and with deliberate senselessness at a collection of percussion instruments, the two (as \"Tessier\" and \"Schmidt\") had produced a strenuously meaningless twelve-minute \"work\" of superficially \"avant-garde\" character; this was completed by the addition of a selection of human whistling sounds (evidently meant to represent the \"tape\"), and with the resulting chaos being edited into some kind of whole by BBC technicians.", "* Wood, Hugh. 2005. \"Susan Bradshaw: Pianist with a Passion for New Music and a Serious Sense of Humour\".

He is best known for his acclaimed completion of Edward Elgar's third symphony, which subsequently gained wide acceptance into Elgar's oeuvre. Apart from opera, his own works include representatives of most traditional genres, and although he made substantial contributions to orchestral and choral repertoire, he is particularly noted for his chamber music. Many of these chamber works were written for his wife, the soprano Jane Manning, and the new music ensemble Jane's Minstrels, which he founded with Manning in 1988. Initially an unrelenting proponent of modernist music, by the 1980s his compositions had embraced aspects of the late romanticism of England, described by his colleague Susan Bradshaw as \"modernized nostalgia\". His mature style is thus characterised by a highly individualised combination of modernism and English romanticism, as well as numerology, wide spaced harmonies, specific intervallic characterisations, and the frequent alternation between strict and fluid rhythmic frameworks.", "In the A Day in the Life of a Mayfly (1981) Payne first embraced his earlier English Romantic influences, and synthesised them with his predominant modernist style; Susan Bradshaw described this as \"modernized nostalgia\". Commissioned by the Fires of London and premiered 24 September 1981 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, A Day in the Life of a Mayfly soon became Payne's best known work up to that point. He continued his renewal of the English tradition in his next major orchestral work, The Spirit's Harvest, which was his second commission for the Proms. Throughout the 1980s he engaged in a variety of genres; he wrote solo, choral, orchestral, brass and chamber works. Also in the 1980s, he held various academic posts. He spent 1983 as a visiting professor at Mills College, California and from 1983 to 1985\u20136 taught composition at the London College of Music. During 1986 he was also a composition professor at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, New South Wales. Among his students was the composer Enid Luff.
