Born in Rugby, Warwickshire, she lives in Exeter with her husband, the travel writer Liam D'Arcy-Brown. She studied for an undergraduate degree in Jurisprudence at Oxford University and for an LLM at University College, London. She currently holds a chair in Law at Exeter University. Specialising as she does in the history of marriage in England and Wales, her monograph Marriage Law & Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment is widely accepted among legal historians as having overturned previous understandings of the history of common law marriage. She is also the author of a number of leading text books such as Cretney & Probert's Family Law and Principles of Family Law.\nProfessor Probert has appeared widely on television and radio, notably including interviews for Channel 4 news during the controversy surrounding the marriage of The Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker-Bowles and on BBC1's Who Do You Think You Are?, in which she threw light on the bigamous marriage of the actress Kim Cattrall's grandfather. \nIn the run-up to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in 2011, Professor Probert published The Rights & Wrongs of Royal Marriage: how the law has led to heartbreak, farce and confusion, and why it must be changed, in which she argued the case for rationalising and simplifying the laws which govern royal marriages in Great Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kenilworth", "response": ["*Rebecca Probert (born 1973), legal historian and expert on marriage law, lives in Kenilworth with her travel-writer husband Liam D'Arcy Brown.Professor Probert's Warwick University webpage"]}, {"page": "King Henry VIII School, Coventry", "response": ["* Professor Rebecca Probert, legal historian."]}, {"page": "Marriage in England and Wales", "response": ["*Rebecca Probert,  Marriage Law and Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009)"]}, {"page": "Liam D'Arcy-Brown", "response": ["Liam James D'Arcy-Brown (born 1970) is a British sinologist and travel writer.

This had stipulated that banns should be called or a marriage licence obtained before a marriage could take place and that the marriage should be celebrated in the parish where at least one of the parties was resident.Constitutions and canons ecclesiasticall, 1604 However, these requirements were directory rather than mandatory and the absence of banns or a licence\u00a0\u2013 or even the fact that the marriage was not celebrated in a church\u00a0\u2013 did not render the marriage void. The only indispensable requirement was that the marriage be celebrated by an Anglican clergyman. The mistaken assumption that a simple exchange of consent would suffice is based on later conflations between the theological position that consent made a marriage and the actual practice of the church courts. Prior to the passage of the 1753 Act such an exchange only created a binding contract to marry rather than a legal marriage.Rebecca Probert, Marriage Law & Practice in the Long Eighteenth Century: A Reassessment chapter 2, (The Misunderstood Contract Per Verba de Praesenti)."]}, {"page": "Catherine Exley", "response": ["Catherine's diary was first published as a booklet issued shortly after her death.
