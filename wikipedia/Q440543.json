There were plans to have a tribute band who were picked by Evans as the best one in the country to appear on this edition, but this was scrapped by UMTV after the two unaired pilot episodes of the main series filmed in early November. The first pilot was filmed on 6 November 2005 at ITV London Studios with Jodie Kidd as the main guest and three U2 tribute bands: Us4//U2, Achtung Baby and Unforgettable Fire. The studio audience were in 70s fancy dress. Each tribute band played 90 seconds of a U2 song. Us4//U2 played \"Beautiful Day\", Achtung Baby played \"Vertigo\" and Unforgettable Fire played \"New Year's Day\". The idea was that after all three bands had played their songs the audience would clap for each band in turn and a mannequin dummy dressed as a rock guitarist in a black wig would register the claps on its clapometer guitar fret board. Us4//U2 were the winners of this pilot episode. The 27 November show was due to feature Oasis tribute bands; the idea was scrapped, however, though footage profiling each tribute act was filmed on 8 November 2005 that was left unseen. Other tribute acts would have seen Robbie Williams being paid homage to. The winner would have played at Evans's end of year party, with the acts playing into the commercial breaks.
