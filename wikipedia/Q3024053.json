A good season earned him a move to Welsh side Swansea City, and in 1993 he moved on to Nottingham Forest. After six years with the club, including a spell in the Premier League, he signed with Watford. After just a season he switched to West Bromwich Albion. In 2003, he transferred to Northampton Town, and a year later he left the Football League for the second and final time, signing with Forest Green Rovers. He transferred to Worcester City in 2005, before joining Tamworth in 2007.\nIn 2010, he was appointed caretaker manager at Tamworth, before being made player-manager on a full-time basis. He resigned the following year, claiming he was being undermined by the club's directors. He was appointed manager of Hucknall Town in October 2011, before departing seven months later.

However first team coach Des Lyttle became caretaker manager and was later hired as player-manager. He resigned as manager on 13 April 2011, and was replaced by Tamworth legend Dale Belford, who was to manage the club for the remaining four games of the season. Belford led Tamworth to last day safety with a 2\u20131 home win over Forest Green Rovers, with Jake Sheridan scoring the all important winning goal.  Belford stepped aside at the end of the season, and the search for a new manager to lead the club for the 2011\u201312 Conference Premier season began, speculation was rife, and the names of former York City manager Martin Foyle, Eastwood Town manager Paul Cox and former Walsall assistant manager Martin O'Connor were all linked to the club, but on 25 May 2011, Tamworth announced Kettering Town manager Marcus Law as the club's new manager."]}, {"page": "Hucknall Town F.C.", "response": ["|2012\u20132012||Des Lyttle"]}, {"page": "Danny Gabbidon", "response": ["Born in Cwmbran, Wales, Gabbidon began his career at West Bromwich Albion, joining as an apprentice in November 1996 before turning professional in July 1998.

Following the appointment of Gary Megson as manager towards the end of the 1999\u20132000 season, Gabbidon failed to keep his place in the team. Megson switched to a 5-3-2 formation, signing Des Lyttle to fill the right-wingback position.

Mills' team eventually finished in 16th place in a season of consolidation; this represented the second highest league placing in the club's history. He made the last appearance of his career aged 48 after starting Tamworth's 4\u20133 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United on 24 April 2010, before substituting himself for Des Lyttle in the 55th minute. This was his third appearance of the season. In the Conference Premier, Tamworth were playing against a number of clubs with Football League pedigrees, meaning they were not able to offer contracts as lucrative or long as many clubs. Mills complemented the competitiveness of his team in this division, saying: \"For a small club like us, it's great to be mixing with these teams. But, while we may be smaller, like last year, we will make sure that we are capable of getting results.\" Tamworth had a strong start in 2010\u201311; they were again in a play-off position by late September 2010, and by the time Mills had left the club they were 12th in the Conference Premier."]}, {"page": "Craig Armstrong (footballer)", "response": ["In October 2011, Armstrong signed for Hucknall Town as a player-coach, linking up with manager Des Lyttle.

Following Des Lyttle's departure as Tamworth manager in April 2011, Belford was appointed caretaker manager for the four remaining league games. His first game in charge was away at play-off chasing York City in which he won 2\u20131. His second game in charge ended in 1\u20130 defeat at home to fellow league strugglers Southport. The game ended with three Tamworth players receiving red cards (Liam Mitchell, Richard Tait and Michael Wylde). Belford's next game in charge was an away fixture at promotion chasing Wrexham. Due to the suspensions from the previous match Belford named himself as a substitute. Tamworth goalkeeper Louis Connor got injured in stoppage time and saw Belford donning the goalkeeper jersey once again for the last few minutes of the game. Belford is now the only player to play for Tamworth in four decades (1980's, 1990's, 2000's and 2010s). Belford's fourth and final game in charge saw him take on Forest Green Rovers in a must win game. In a very edgy 90 minutes, Tamworth did win the match 2\u20131 thus meaning Belford had kept the club in the Conference National at the expense of Southport who eventually stayed up due to Rushden & Diamonds entering liquidation."]}, {"page": "Nigel Gibbs", "response": ["When fit, Gibbs had been Watford's first choice right-back since 1985, with the exception of 1994\u201395, where Gerard Lavin's form kept a recovering Gibbs in the reserves. A combination of Gibbs' age, and a desire to acquire more strength in depth for the Premier League, prompted Taylor to sign right-backs Des Lyttle and Neil Cox in 1999. Despite the competition, Gibbs managed to make 20 appearances in 1999\u20132000, and his Premier League experience included victories over Chelsea, Coventry City and Southampton, although these were not enough to prevent relegation back to the First Division."]}, {"page": "Michael Appleton", "response": ["At the start of the 2001\u201302 season, Appleton was a regular in the first team, but on 19 November 2001, Appleton tore posterior cruciate ligaments in his right knee, after an accidental training ground collision with teammate Des Lyttle. He was initially expected to be out for the rest of the season. With West Brom getting promoted to the Premier League, Appleton had to wait until February 2003 for his return to football, 28 minutes into a reserve team match against former club Manchester United. In November 2003, at the age of 27, Appleton was forced to retire, after losing his two-year battle against injury. West Brom manager Gary Megson described Appleton's retirement as \"One of the saddest days I've had as a manager, Football can't afford to be losing a player of his like.\""]}, {"page": "Chris Smith (footballer, born 1981)", "response": ["Smith committed his future to the club over the summer of 2006 and captained the team during the 2006\u201307 pre-season.

During August 2006, Smith started a spell of playing as a central midfielder after Des Lyttle moved into defence.

He signed a new one-and-a-half-year contract with Worcester in December 2006, contracting him to the club until the summer of 2008. Smith received a two-match suspension after picking up his 10th booking of the season in a 3\u20131 home win over Hinckley United on 20 January 2007. This meant he missed matches against Welling United and Scarborough, before scoring on his return in a 3\u20133 home draw with Vauxhall Motors on 12 February 2007. He missed a match against Alfreton Town on 9 April 2007 to rest an ankle, despite playing through some previous matches with this complaint. Smith returned in the following match, a 2\u20131 home win over Worksop on 14 April 2007, as a 69th-minute substitute, despite not being fully fit.
