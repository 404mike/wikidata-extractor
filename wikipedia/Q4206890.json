The enormous advance (an alleged \u00a3500,000) demanded and subsequently obtained by Amis for the novel attracted what the author described as \"an Eisteddfod of hostility\" from writers and critics after he abandoned his long-serving agent, the late Pat Kavanagh, in order to be represented by the Harvard-educated Andrew Wylie. The split was by no means amicable; it created a rift between Amis and his long-time friend, Julian Barnes, who was married to Kavanagh. According to Amis's autobiography Experience (2000), he and Barnes had not resolved their differences.Amis, Martin, Experience (2000), pp. 247\u2013249 The Information itself deals with the relationship between a pair of British writers of fiction. One, a spectacularly successful purveyor of \"airport novels\", is envied by his friend, an equally unsuccessful writer of philosophical and generally abstruse prose. The novel is written in the author's classic style: characters appearing as stereotyped caricatures, grotesque elaborations on the wickedness of middle age, and a general air of post-apocalyptic malaise."]}, {"page": "Julian Barnes", "response": ["In 1980, Barnes, under the name Dan Kavanagh (who recently married the literary agent Pat Kavanagh),Pseud\u2019s Corner - John Sutherland, Lrb.co.uk, Retrieved 19/9/2021. published the first of four crime novels about Duffy, one of Britain's first gay male detectives.
