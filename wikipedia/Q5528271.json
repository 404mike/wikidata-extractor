He has won the Pickup Truck Racing championship three times; first in 2002 and then in 2004,and again in 2008, and has also taken the runner up position twice in 2001 and 2003. On 24 June 2007 Gavin became the all-time career top points scorer, taking the position away from Pete Wilkinson. Gavin won the 2008 championship, making him the first driver in the series to take three overall titles.\nIn 2012 Gavin suffered from prolonged depressive episodes which subsequently led to several failed attempts to kill himself. Gavin faced further difficulties in 2014 when he was arrested and convicted of arson. The target was Barnards VW garage in Station Road West, Stowmarket where he left more than \u00a340,000 worth of damages in his wake. The blaze was started on 13 November by Seager out of a \"misplaced sense of loyalty\" to his brother-in-law who had \"a beef\" with Barnards about a problem with his car not being covered by a warranty, said Andrew Thompson, prosecuting. Gavin was given a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work in the community.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pickup Truck Racing", "response": ["| Gavin Seager", "| Gavin Seager", "| Gavin Seager", "| Gavin Seager"]}, {"page": "Pete Wilkinson", "response": ["In June 2007, Pete became the first Pickup Truck Racing driver to pass the 20,000-point mark, on the all-time career points table.

So during the off season, the truck was taken to different tracks and to its engine builder for progress work and the team was in a positive frame of mind for the 2006 Season. In 2010, he claimed his third championship title after fending off Pete Stevens by 68 points, and became the second driver to have won the championship three times, the other driver being Gavin Seager. At the 2011 season finale, he won the championship a record fourth time, and went on to win his fifth championship in 2012."]}, {"page": "2008 Pickup Truck Racing", "response": ["The 2008 Pickup Truck Racing season was the 12th Pickup Truck Racing season.
