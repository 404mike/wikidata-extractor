According to Guinness World Records, \"Bristow\" was the longest running daily cartoon strip by a single author. The character Bristow is even one year older than that, as he debuted in Dickens' older series Oddbod in The Sunday Times in 1960. Due to his popularity he received his own spin-off series soon afterwards. Dickens broke the original record held by Marc Sleen, whose The Adventures of Nero was drawn for 45 years without any assistance. However, even Dickens' record has been broken in his turn by Jim Russell, whose series The Potts ran for 62 years.

Muliyadi elaborated that The Beano and The Dandys \"theme of a child's world\" is evident in Lat's Keluarga Si Mamat.  Others commented that Lat's art stood out on its own.  Singaporean cartoonist Morgan Chua believed that Lat \"managed to create an impressively local style while remaining original\", and although comics historian Isao Shimizu found Lat's lines \"somewhat crude\", he noted that the cartoonist's work was \"highly original\" and \"full of life\".
