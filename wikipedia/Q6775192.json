A versatile player, he played International rugby at flyhalf and centre and first class rugby at full back and wing where he scored a try against the All Blacks at Moseley for the Midlands Counties West when they defeated them. His only international try was scored against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, the only score in a 4-0 victory. \nMartin Cooper began his career at Wolverhampton before moving to Moseley. He soon was called up to the England squad and won his first cap in 1973. In the same year he played for England against New Zealand in Auckland, 16-10, the first home country national side to beat them in NZ. Martin Johnsons side was the second. \nHe later captained Moseley for three years including a John Player Cup against Leicester. His last game was in another John Player Final (shared with Gloucester) in 1982. He retired that year.\nCooper is an Independent Financial Adviser with his own company, based in Worcester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club", "response": ["*  Martin Cooper *"]}, {"page": "1973 England rugby union tour of Fiji and New Zealand", "response": ["*Martin Cooper (Moseley) 2 Caps"]}, {"page": "Martin Cooper", "response": ["*Martin Cooper (musicologist) (1910\u20131986), English music critic and author", "*Martin Cooper (inventor) (born 1928), designer of the first mobile phone", "*Martin Cooper (rugby union) (born 1948), England international rugby union player", "*Martin Cooper (musician) (born 1958), British painter and a musician", "*Martin Cooper (born 1974), American drag queen performing under Coco Montrese"]}, {"page": "Martin Cooper (Rugby Player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martin Cooper (rugby union) "]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1020||Martin Cooper||fly-half ||1973-02-24||v France at Twickenham"]}, {"page": "Martin Cooper (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martin Cooper (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 John Player Cup", "response": ["| ||10|| Martin Cooper (c)"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 John Player Cup", "response": ["| ||15|| Martin Cooper "]}, {"page": "1977 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Martin Cooper"]}, {"page": "1976 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Martin Cooper"]}, {"page": "1975 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Martin Cooper"]}, {"page": "Leicester Tigers in cup finals", "response": ["| ||10|| Martin Cooper (c)"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 Divisional Championship (rugby union)", "response": ["|FH ||10||  Martin Cooper (Moseley)"]}]}}
