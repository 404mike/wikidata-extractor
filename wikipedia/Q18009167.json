Few research students studied under De Madariaga by the time she retired in 1984 and notable ones included Janet M. Hartley and Pia Pera. She had helped to establish the Russian Studies course, was chairperson of its Academic Assembly and served as a member of its Council when it was under threat of closure. De Madariaga was elected as a fellow of the British Academy in 1990 and was made a corresponding member of the Real Academia de la Historia a year later. The Dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 allowed her works to be published in Russia and to be used by the country's historians. She compiled 13 essays to form a 1998 collection called Politics and Culture in Eighteenth-Century Russia. Her final book Ivan the Terrible: First Tsar of Russia was published in 2005."]}]}}
