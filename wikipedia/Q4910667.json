Long time regular Bill Robertson sustained an injury in the 1959\u201360 season, and Hickson was drafted in to provide cover. He played ten Second Division matches in December through to March but was dropped after conceding five away at Liverpool and Tommy Younger took his place for the remainder of the season. He played just once more for Stoke, on the final day of the 1960\u201361 season in a 3\u20131 win over Liverpool at the Victoria Ground. He joined his hometown club Crewe Alexandra in 1962, and played 43 of the club's 46 Fourth Division games as promotion was achieved in 1962\u201363. He then featured 30 times in the 1963\u201364 season, as Jimmy McGuigan's \"Railwaymen\" were relegated straight back out of the Third Division. He lost his place at Gresty Road under new boss Ernie Tagg, and featured just nine times in the 1966\u201367 campaign and was completely absent in the 1965\u201366 and 1967\u201368 campaigns. He was loaned to Fourth Division side Port Vale in August 1968, as manager Gordon Lee needed cover for the injured Stuart Sharratt. Described as a \"part-time, pipe-smoking civil servant\", he featured for the \"Valiants\" in the next twenty matches, but was recalled by Crewe in November that year. He later played for Southport, and played three Third Division games for the \"Sandgrounders\". He also had a loan spell with Shrewsbury Town, but did not take to the field at Gay Meadow. He later emigrated to South Africa to play for Cape Town City."]}, {"page": "Dennis Herod", "response": ["Herod made history on 16 February 1952, in an away match at Aston Villa.

However the following season new manager Frank Taylor signalled his arrival with the signing of Birmingham City's Bill Robertson. In December Robertson broke his leg and Herod was recalled although he himself broke his leg against West Bromwich Albion a month later.
