He joined the Free Trade Party of Henry Parkes in 1887, but refused to serve in Parkes' governments due to personal enmity. When Parkes resigned as party leader in 1891, Reid was elected in his place. He became premier after the 1894 election and remained in office for just over five years. Despite never winning majority government, Reid was able to pass a number of domestic reforms concerning the civil service and public finances. He was an advocate of federation and played a part in drafting the new constitution, where he became known as a strong defender of his colony's interests. In 1901, he was elected to the new federal parliament representing the Division of East Sydney.", "The new premier, Alexander Stuart, offered Reid the position of Colonial Treasurer in January 1883, but he thought it wiser to accept the junior office of Minister of Public Instruction. He served 14 months in this office and succeeded in passing a much improved Education Act, which included the establishment of the first government high schools in the leading towns, technical schools (which became a model for the other colonies) and the provision of evening lectures at the university."]}, {"page": "Henry Parkes", "response": ["He was now 70 years old. He opened an office in Pitt Street as representative of the financial association which had sent him to England, and remained in this position until 1887. He could not, however, keep long away from politics. At the beginning of 1885 W. B. Dalley, while acting-premier, offered a contingent of troops to go to the Sudan and the offer was accepted. Parkes strongly disapproved and, though public opinion was against him, on 31 March he won a by-election in Argyle. When he took his seat in September objection was taken to claims of parliamentary corruption he had made when resigning from Parliament in 1884, and Sir Alexander Stuart moved a resolution affirming that the words he had used were a gross libel on the house. His motion was carried by four votes. Parkes did not apologise, but his ministry was discouraged from going further. One of the supporters of the ministry moved that Parkes should be expelled but only obtained the support of his seconder."]}, {"page": "Alexander Stuart", "response": ["Alexander Stuart may refer to:", "*Alexander Stuart (scientist) (1673\u20131742), scientist, winner of the Copley Medal", "*Alexander Stuart (Australian politician) (1824\u20131886), Premier of New South Wales, Australia between 1883 and 1885", "*Alexander Stuart (writer), author and screenwriter of The War Zone", "*Alexander Stuart (Canadian politician) (1857\u20131928), Ontario farmer and political figure", "*Alexander Stuart (New Zealand politician) (c1875\u20131954), New Zealand politician", "*Alexander Stuart, 5th Lord Blantyre (died 1704), Scottish nobleman, soldier and politician", "*Alexander Stuart, 5th Earl of Moray (1634\u20131701), Scottish nobleman", "*Alexander Stuart (priest), Anglican priest in Ireland in the 19th-century"]}, {"page": "George Dibbs", "response": ["In 1882, he won St Leonards, with the support of the unions. In January 1883 he was given the portfolio of Colonial Treasurer in the ministry of Sir Alexander Stuart, and was committed to continued railway-building although revenue was under pressure due to a suspension of land sales and no new taxation. Dibbs would later describe this decision as \"the gravest political blunder of my life\". The Assembly refused to pass an increase in property tax, so he decided to borrow an unprecedented \u00a314m, giving him a subsequent reputation for extravagance. Stuart resigned due to ill-health in October 1885 and Dibbs became Premier. In the October 1885 elections, he was attacked mercilessly by Parkes who defeated him in the St Leonards election, was defeated for The Richmond, but he won The Murrumbidgee.

He was Colonial Secretary from October to December 1885 in the first ministry of George Dibbs, and in February 1886 became the first practising Catholic Premier and was also Colonial Treasurer. His administration lasted only 11 months and had a troubled career, having inherited a financial crisis. His attempts to balance the budget included a 5 per cent ad valorem tariff, which came to be seen as a violation of his free-trade platform. Jennings was scarcely a strong enough man to control a ministry which included Dibbs, Want and Lyne. He did not contest the 1887 election."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Illawarra", "response": ["| Alexander Stuart"]}]}}
