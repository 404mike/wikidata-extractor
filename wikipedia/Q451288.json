Only one actor ever regularly shared the stage with Humphries, and this was during the Edna segments: English actress Emily Perry played Edna's long-suffering bridesmaid from New Zealand, Madge Allsop, whose character never spoke.", "Throughout Edna's career, Madge Allsop was played by English actress Emily Perry until her death in 2008.

First mentioned in Edna's monologues in the 1960s, Madge was subsequently depicted on stage, TV and film, over three decades, by several people.  The character was discontinued following the retirement of British actress Emily Perry, who played the role for over 15 years.", "*1987\u20132003 \u2013 Emily Perry (on stage and TV)", "Madge Allsop was first portrayed on television in 1976, when she appeared (played by actress Madeleine Orr) in an episode of the BBC series The Barry Humphries Show.  Following Orr's death in 1979, the role of Madge was re-cast. She appeared alongside Dame Edna on the BBC Parkinson show in 1982, with her face covered in bandages. The character was written into Humphries' 1987 film, Les Patterson Saves the World, and was portrayed, as a one-off appearance, by Australian actress Connie Hobbs.  Later that same year, Humphries announced his search for \"definitive Madge\", who would appear alongside Edna in his new BBC TV series, The Dame Edna Experience.  Of the audition, Humphries recalled, \"all of them tried too hard. Some were whimsical, some camp, but most were far too over the top to resemble an oppressed, inarticulate New Zealand spinster whom life had passed by.\"Humphries, Barry. My Life as Me, pp 232\u201333.  However, after they saw Emily Perry's understated performance, they knew that they had found the perfect Madge.  As she later recalled, \"I did nothing at the audition, and I've done nothing ever since.\"Barker, Dennis. \"Dame Edna's Doleful Sidekick\", The Age [Melbourne], February 25, 2008. ", "Emily Perry's appearance on the Dame Edna Experience was well-received; she subsequently became the definitive Madge Allsop, reprising the role in many of Humphries' other TV specials, including One more Audience with Dame Edna Everage (1988), A Night on Mount Edna (1990), Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch (1992), Dame Edna's Hollywood (1993) and Dame Edna's Work Experience (1996).  Perry's last on-screen appearance as Madge Allsop was a cameo in the TV special Dame Edna lives at the Palace (2003), in which the then 97-year-old actress was 'caught' in bed with Ozzy Osbourne.  ", "Emily Perry became so strongly identified with the character of Madge Allsop that, after her retirement in 2004, the character of Madge was also retired, as it was felt that no other actress could ever recreate her.  When Humphries embarked upon a new TV talk show in 2007, The Dame Edna Treatment, the role of Dame  Edna's silent scapegoat was filled by an actress portraying her errant (and hitherto unseen) daughter, Valmai Gittis.", "The character of Madge Allsop figured prominently in the book My Gorgeous Life (1989), which, although written by Humphries, was purported to be an autobiography of Dame Edna herself.  The book provides much background to Madge and Edna's ongoing friendship, and includes a detailed account of the death of Madge's husband, Douglas Allsop, whilst on their honeymoon in Rotorua.  In the line drawings that illustrate the book (drawn by John Richardson), the young Madge is depicted as a recognizable caricature of Emily Perry.", "Since the 1980s, theatre programmes for Barry Humphries' one-man shows have frequently included photographs of Madge Allsop (as portrayed by Emily Perry) alongside those of Dame Edna and Sir Les Patterson.  For example, the glossy souvenir programme for  Humphries' Australian tour, Dame Edna: Back to my roots and other suckers included depictions of Madge in her pink frilly \u201cEdna Loves Me\u201d apron, dancing with Dame Edna while wearing a Vivienne Westwood outfit, shopping with Dame Edna in an exclusive boutique, posing mournfully along Errol Flynn's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and being attacked by a giant prop shark in Edna's swimming pool.Theatre program for Melbourne production of Back to my Roots and other Suckers, 2003.", "Madge Allsop's most notable appearance on stage was as part of the 1998 West End production of Dame Edna: the Spectacle.  The First Act of this show was essentially a retelling of Dame Edna's life story in the form of a lavish stage musical, and Madge Allsop was portrayed as a young woman by Kerris Peeling and as a child by either (depending on the performance) Keely Fawcett, Caroline Graham or Gabrielle Hoffman.
