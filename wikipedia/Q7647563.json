She retired due to ill health. Renwick persuaded her to return to work on the final series to provide a continuity and circularity. However, her ill health quickly forced her to resign from the show for a second time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "One Foot in the Grave", "response": ["Most of the first five series of One Foot in the Grave were produced and directed by Susan Belbin, the exceptions being \"Love and Death\", which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director Sydney Lotterby and \"Starbound\", for which Gareth Gwenlan (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Afterward, Belbin retired owing to ill-health, and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors."]}, {"page": "Only Fools and Horses", "response": ["Only Fools and Horses had two producers: Ray Butt from 1981 to 1987, and Gareth Gwenlan thereafter.

Butt directed series three and five, as well as the 1985, 1986 and 1987 Christmas specials. Tony Dow became the established director after 1988, directing all subsequent episodes, bar the first part of Miami Twice, which was directed by Gareth Gwenlan.For the full production team, see Webber (2003), p. 161 John Sullivan was executive producer on seven of the final eight episodes."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Creek", "response": ["Others who were tried for the part included Nigel Planer (who would later guest star) and Angus Deayton (who had already worked with Renwick and director Susan Belbin on One Foot in the Grave).
