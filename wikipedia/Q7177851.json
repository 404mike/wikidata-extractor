From the late 1950s, with increasingly sophisticated programming, programs would run for hours or days, on multimillion-dollar computers, to generate a few minutes of music. One way around this was to use a 'hybrid system' of digital control of an analog synthesiser and early examples of this were Max Mathews' GROOVE system (1969) and also MUSYS by Peter Zinovieff (1969)."]}, {"page": "Electronic music", "response": ["The earliest digital sampling was done on the EMS Musys system, developed by Peter Grogono (software), David Cockerell (hardware and interfacing), and Peter Zinovieff (system design and operation) at their London (Putney) Studio c. 1969."]}, {"page": "The Mask of Orpheus", "response": ["The Mask of Orpheus is an opera with music by Harrison Birtwistle, electronic music realised by Barry Anderson and a libretto by Peter Zinovieff.

He has commented that ICL was always supportive of his outside artistic endeavours, offering for example, allocation of time on the mainframes, which he undertook mostly outside of peak hours.  As the Bracknell branch of ICL did not initially have a mainframe computer, Sutcliffe would occasionally travel to the Putney, London branch.  This was located across the River Thames from EMS and this facilitated his collaboration with Zinovieff.  Sutcliffe brought the paper tape of a music program he had written at ICL to Zinovieff to \u201crealise\u201d and thus began their collaboration, with Sutcliffe assisting the Studio by writing software for the synthesizers they produced.
