Although not new in the twentieth century, a noted increase in artistic engagement began in the late 1960s, at the time of second-wave feminism, with artists including Shigeko Kubota, Carolee Schneemann, Judy Clark, Judy Chicago, Catherine Elwes, Marina Abramovi\u0107, Gina Pane, Ana Mendieta, and later Orlan. Since the 1960s, artists have continued to take an interest in menstrual art.

British Film Institute, 2007. video film, We Have Fun Drawing Conclusions. Here he uses the words and pictures of the popular 1950s and 60s Ladybird children\u2019s books Peter and Jane. 'Using only the lightest hint of irony, Hawley reads the text over the original illustrations....Peter helps daddy to wash the car while Jane is making tea with mummy in the kitchen. Audiences were well able to laugh at the absurdity of Ladybird\u2019s transparent attempt to manufacture complementary male and female subjects. However, the reality for countless individuals who were exposed to this form of brainwashing at an early age was that they would never entirely shake off the cultural ghosts of Peter and Jane.'Catherine Elwes, Video Art: A Guided Tour, I.B.Tauris and Co, 2005., p70", "Trout descending a Staircase, commissioned by BBC2 and the Arts Council in 1987, used Paintbox software to create a series of still lifes. 'At the time, the Paintbox could generate a tracer effect that resembled the decaying repeat patterns in Duchamp's\u2019 painting Nude Descending a Staircase No.2. Hawley devised a method whereby he could key into an ornate gilt frame a series of classic still-life subjects \u2013 flowers, bananas, leeks and, most absurdly, a trout....These instant Futurist paintings not only exposed the workings of video effects within a modernist framework, but also mocked the march of art historical progress...Hawley seemed to be agreeing with the classic philistine position that \u2018even a child could do that\u2019...At the same time, his work reintroduced a narrative \u2013 that of the artist in the act of making images \u2013 while continually emphasising the constructed nature of what he was creating.'Catherine Elwes, Video Art: A Guided Tour, I.B.Tauris and Co, 2005., p83", "In 1995, Hawley and Steyger made Language Lessons, a 35 minute documentary on invented languages from Esperanto to Volap\u00fck, a language spoken by only 30 people worldwide. According to Catherine Elwes, 'Language Lessons provides a delightful insight into the more eccentric pastimes of the average Englishman as well as the realisation that all languages are constructed and, as one learned interviewee averred, speaking English now \u2018ties you to a world-view of dominant American culture\u2019.'
