However, Dunstan realised the futility of such a move and instead sought to humiliate the LCL into bringing an end to malapportionment. Although Stott's decision to support the LCL ended any realistic chance of Dunstan remaining premier, Dunstan did not immediately resign his commission, intending to force Hall and the LCL to demonstrate that they had support on the floor of the Assembly when it reconvened. He used the six weeks before the start of the new legislature to draw attention to malapportionment. Protests were held on 15 March in Light Square. There, Dunstan spoke to a crowd of more than 10,000: \"We need to show that the people of SA feel that at last the watershed has been reached in this, and that they will not continue to put up with a system which is as undemocratic as the present one in SA.\"Blewett and Jaensch, pp. 172\u2013173. On 16 April, the first day of the new House's sitting, Dunstan lost a confidence vote. With it now clear that the LCL had control of the House, Dunstan tendered his resignation to Governor Edric Bastyan.Parkin, p. 5.Blewett and Jaensch, pp. 173\u2013177. Hall was then sworn in as premier. However, the six weeks of protesting had brought nationwide criticism of the unfairness of the electoral system and put more pressure on the LCL to relent to reforms; it has been seen as one of the most important political events of its time."]}, {"page": "Eadric", "response": ["* Edric Bastyan (1903\u20131980), British governor of South Australia and Tasmania"]}, {"page": "January 1965", "response": ["*Sir Edric Bastyan, Governor of South Australia, officially opened Kensington's Olympic sports arena.Advertiser, 25 January 1965.
