He followed his father into stonemasonry at the age of thirteen and during the late 1850s spent a considerable period travelling the south of England, attempting to find work.  In 1865, he moved to London and worked on the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster.\nIn 1872, Broadhurst was elected as the Chair of a Masons' Committee during an industrial dispute.  After achieving a major victory, Broadhurst began working full-time for the Stonemasons Union.  He also became the union's delegate to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and was elected to its Parliamentary Committee.  In 1873, he became the secretary of the Labour Representation League.\nAt the 1874 general election, two candidates sponsored by the League were elected, but Broadhurst was unsuccessful at High Wycombe.  In 1875, he was elected Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC, the post which was later to become the General Secretaryship.\nAt the 1880 general election, Broadhurst was elected as the Liberal\u2013Labour Member of Parliament for Stoke-upon-Trent.  Within the House of Commons, he pushed through legislation enabling working men to act as Justices of the Peace, and for all Government contracts to include a \"fair wage\" clause.  In 1884, he was appointed to the Royal Commission on the housing of the working class.\nIn 1885 general election, Broadhurst moved to represent Birmingham Bordesley.  He was appointed as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in the Liberal government, the first person from a working-class or labour movement background to hold a ministerial post.  He was the first minister to be granted permission not to attend levees.  Following his appointment, he resigned from his TUC post.  William Ewart Gladstone attempted but failed to have his ministerial salary reduced.\nFor the 1886 general election, Broadhurst moved seats again, this time winning Nottingham West.  Free of ministerial responsibilities, he was again elected Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC, but became increasingly isolated as more left wing members, such as Keir Hardie, accused him of not sufficiently representing the interests of labour within Parliament.  Following a defeat in a crucial vote at the 1890 TUC conference, and citing declining health, Broadhurst resigned the post.\nIn 1892, Broadhurst was appointed to a second Royal Commission, on the aged poor.  He lost his seat at Nottingham West at the 1892 general election, and was also defeated at the 1893 Grimsby by-election.  However, he returned to Parliament as MP for Leicester at the 1894 Leicester by-election, holding this seat as a Lib\u2013Lab MP until 1906.\nFollowing his retirement, Broadhurst moved to Norfolk, where he became an alderman. He died at the age of 71.\nBroadhurst married Eliza Olley, daughter of Edward Olley a journeyman currier at Norwich in 1859.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1911", "response": ["** Henry Broadhurst, British trade unionist, politician (b. 1840)"]}, {"page": "Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale", "response": ["During his life, the bulk of the British press treated Albert Victor with nothing but respect and the eulogies that immediately followed his death were full of praise. The radical politician, Henry Broadhurst, who had met both Albert Victor and his brother George, noted that they had \"a total absence of affectation or haughtiness\".Henry Broadhurst, 1901, quoted in Cook, p. 100. On the day of Albert Victor's death, the leading Liberal politician, William Ewart Gladstone, wrote in his personal private diary \"a great loss to our party\".Matthew, H. C. G. (editor) (1994).

The exact nature of his \"dissipations\" is not clear, but in 1994 Theo Aronson favoured the theory on \"admittedly circumstantial\" evidence that the \"unspecified 'dissipations' were predominantly homosexual\". Aronson's judgement was based on Albert Victor's \"adoration of his elegant and possessive mother; his 'want of manliness'; his 'shrinking from horseplay'; [and] his 'sweet, gentle, quiet and charming' nature\", as well as the Cleveland Street rumours and his opinion that there is \"a certain amount of homosexuality in all men\".Aronson, p. 119.
