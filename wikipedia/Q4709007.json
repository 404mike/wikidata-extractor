Chris Charsley of Small Heath, who later went on to be Chief Constable of Coventry, made his solitary England appearance in goal. Alban Harrison (Old Westminsters) and Fred Pelly (Old Foresters) made their d\u00e9buts as the two full-backs and Norman Cooper (Cambridge University) made his solitary appearance at centre-half. Robert Topham, an amateur player with Wolverhampton Wanderers, who had previously declined an invitation to play for Wales following his selection in 1885, made the first of his two appearances at outside right, with Walter Gilliat of Old Carthusians making his solitary appearance at inside right. Gilliat, an excellent dribbler of the ball, would probably have made more England appearances but for his religious beliefs, and went on to become the vicar of Iver and the rector of Sevenoaks."]}, {"page": "Old Westminsters F.C.", "response": ["*Alban Harrison (2 caps)", "On 25 February 1893 Alban Harrison, Rupert Sandilands and William Winckworth, played together in the match against Ireland, with Winckworth and Sandilands both scoring in a 6-1 victory."]}]}}
