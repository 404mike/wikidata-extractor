He scored 38 goals in 479 league and cup appearances across a 19-year career.\nStarting his career at Stoke City in 1996, after three years he moved on to Cambridge United, following a short loan period. After this he spent a season with Kidderminster Harriers, then another season with Blackpool, before signing with Mansfield Town in 2002. After two years he transferred to Scunthorpe United, where he was loaned out to Hereford United, before signing with Notts County in 2007. County loaned him back to both former club Kidderminster and Port Vale in 2008, before he joined Tamworth in 2009 via another old club, Mansfield Town. In 2011, he switched to Evesham United via St Neots Town. He joined Halesowen Town in 2013, and helped the club to the Northern Premier League Division One South title in 2013\u201314, then moved on to Hinckley AFC in July 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Countdown (game show)", "response": ["Contestants who have or had become notable for other reasons include Nuts magazine editor-at-large Pete Cashmore, rugby player Ayoola Erinle, footballers Neil MacKenzie, Clarke Carlisle and Matt Le Tissier, musicians Jon Marsh and Nick Saloman, comedian Alex Horne, noted Irish playwright Peter Sheridan and Professional Darts Referee Kirk Bevins, who won Series 60 and was a quarter-finalist in the 30th Birthday Championship."]}, {"page": "Richard Rose (footballer)", "response": ["Rose soon found a new home at newly promoted Hereford United where he played initially in centre midfield.
