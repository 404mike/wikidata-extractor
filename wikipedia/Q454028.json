She soon moved into the Algonquin Hotel, a hotspot for the artistic and literary elite of the era, where she quickly charmed her way into the famed Algonquin Round Table of the hotel bar. She was dubbed one of the \"Four Riders of the Algonquin\", consisting of Bankhead, Estelle Winwood, Eva Le Gallienne, and Blyth Daly. Three of the four were non-heterosexual: Bankhead and Daly were bisexuals, and Le Gallienne was a lesbian. Bankhead's father had warned her to avoid alcohol and men when she got to New York; Bankhead later quipped \"He didn't say anything about women and cocaine.\"Fleming, E. J., The Fixers, McFarland & Co., 2005, p. 109 The Algonquin's wild parties introduced Bankhead to cocaine and marijuana, of which she later remarked \"Cocaine isn't habit-forming and I know because I've been taking it for years.\" Bankhead did abstain from drinking, keeping half of her promise to her father. At the Algonquin, Bankhead befriended actress Estelle Winwood. She also met Ethel Barrymore, who attempted to persuade her to change her name to Barbara. Bankhead declined, and Vanity Fair later wrote \"she's the only actress on both sides of the Atlantic to be recognized by her first name only.\"", "Bankhead appeared in a revival of No\u00ebl Coward's Private Lives, taking it on tour and then to Broadway for the better part of two years. The play's run made Bankhead a fortune. From that time, Bankhead could command 10% of the gross and was billed larger than any other actor in the cast, although she usually granted equal billing to Estelle Winwood, a frequent co-star and close friend from the 1920s through Bankhead's lifetime."]}, {"page": "Crow T.
