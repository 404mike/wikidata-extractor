Over the next ten years she was to have five shows there. She also exhibited with the Royal Society of British Artists and with the Royal Cambrian Academy. During the winter of 1963 she held a two-women show with Glenys Cour at the Attic Gallery in Swansea. In all her work featured in almost thirty solo shows in Britain and her work is represented in galleries in both Australia and the United States. The Welsh Arts Council toured two retrospectives of her work, first in 1974 and again in 1983 and 1984. The Rocket Press organised a life-time retrospective of her work in 1993, which Howard-Jones attended and included works she had produced in her late eighties. A volume of her poetry, Heart of the Rock: Poems by Ray Howard-Jones was published at the same time. She had a deep religious faith and, late in her life, took vows as an oblate at an Anglican Benedictine community."]}, {"page": "List of women artists associated with Wales", "response": ["*Glenys Cour (born 1924), painter and stained glass artist"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Glenys Cour (born 1924), painter, stained glass artist"]}, {"page": "2020 in Wales", "response": ["*9 October \u2013 In the postponed Queen's Birthday Honours 2020, Welsh recipients include Warren Gatland, former Wales rugby head coach, and opera singer Rebecca Evans (CBE), Wales rugby captain Alun Wyn Jones (OBE) and artist Glenys Cour (MBE)."]}]}}
