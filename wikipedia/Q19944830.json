However he was defeated 4\u20136 by Ryan Day in the following round. At the 2013 UK Championship, McManus defeated Joel Walker 6\u20135, winning the match on a respotted black, before losing to Michael Holt 4\u20136 in the last 64.

He was defeated 5\u20133 by Hossein Vafaei in the last 16. A pair of 10\u20137 victories over Darryl Hill and Sydney Wilson moved McLeod one win away from qualifying for the World Championship and he took the first seven frames against Hammad Miah. Miah then rallied to be 7\u20136 down, but McLeod would win 10\u20137. At the Crucible he drew Judd Trump, a man who went into the tournament proclaiming that \"I honestly believe I can play to a standard which is very rare nowadays,\" and that he was \"the best\" in the world. He won the first four frames, but McLeod, at 46 the oldest player in the event, responded brilliantly to take a 5\u20134 lead. McLeod went on to claim a famous 10\u20138 victory against a player ranked 52 places above him in the rankings and said it was the biggest win of his career. He lost 13\u20133 to Stephen Maguire in the second round with a session to spare and said the hype from his win over Trump had distracted him."]}, {"page": "Leo Fernandez", "response": ["|  Sydney Wilson "]}, {"page": "Mark Joyce", "response": ["Joyce opened the season with three wins to qualify for the Australian Goldfields Open and beat Mark Allen 5\u20132, before losing 5\u20134 to Matthew Selt.

Joyce built a 5\u20130 lead over Dechawat Poomjaeng, but lost six frames in a row to be eliminated in the third round. He bounced back to win two matches and qualify for the German Masters and recorded his second 5\u20132 first round triumph of the season over Allen.

His ranking title gave him entry into the Champion of Champions, where he lost 4\u20132 to Joe Perry in the first round and he suffered an opening round 6\u20135 loss to Sydney Wilson, a player ranked more than 100 places lower than White, at the UK Championship.
