After his retirement, Walker lived in Oxford and became one of the editors of the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine. His house, in Summertown, a select suburb of Oxford was named Aorangi, a M\u0101ori name for Aoraki/Mount Cook, a favourite place visited on his travels.\nWalker's collections from the Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and the Mediterranean\nare shared by the Natural History Museum, London and the Oxford University Museum which also conserves his British Coleoptera.\nHe was a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society (President 1919\u201320) and a Fellow of the Linnean Society.\nWalker is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of lizards, Draco walkeri and Lerista walkeri, both described in 1891 by George Albert Boulenger of the British Museum (Natural History).\nThe epithet of a tiny australian bat, delivered by Walker and described as species Nyctophilus walkeri, was given by the author Oldfield Thomas to honour Walker's many collections of specimens.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of coleopterists", "response": ["* James John Walker"]}, {"page": "James John Walker", "response": ["James John Walker may refer to:", "* James John Walker (entomologist) (1851\u20131939), English entomologist", "* James John Walker (1846\u20131922), businessman, see J.

The description was published by Oldfield Thomas in 1892, and continued to be widely recognised by subsequent authorities. The type specimen was collected at the Adelaide River in the Northern Territory. The collector of the specimen was noted by the author, marine engineer and entomologist James John Walker, and the epithet walkeri proposed to commemorate his extensive field collections. The description of Thomas nominated this as the third species of the genus, comparing it to his earlier description for Nyctophilus microtis, published in 1888. The type for the genus, once regarded as monotypic, was Nyctophilus timoriensis, named as the Australian long-eared bat."]}, {"page": "Chremistica ochracea", "response": ["*James John Walker"]}, {"page": "Lerista walkeri", "response": ["The specific name, walkeri, is in honor of British entomologist James John Walker.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M (2011).
