Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post complimented the song for being busy and brassy.

Referring to the attitudes of his readers he was clear in a February 2011 Press Gazette interview: \u201cI know they absolutely detest everything to do with the European Union. I know they\u2019re deeply concerned about the enormous levels of immigration which have gone unchecked. I know they detest the idea of multiculturalism which is ghettoising the country.\u201dCiar Byrne \"Peter Hill: 'Express is world's greatest newspaper'\" , Press Gazette, 8 February 2011 On the Diana stories he was quoted by The Independent newspaper in 2006 as saying: \"I can tell you that people want to read about the Diana conspiracy because the figures tell me that they do ...the more we write [the articles], the more they are turning out to be true.\""]}, {"page": "Give It 2 Me", "response": ["\"Give It 2 Me\" is an upbeat dance-pop song. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said that the song has a club-like synth arrangement with a hip hop \"feel to it\". Chris Williams of Entertainment Weekly felt that the hip hop feel is brought about by the use of snare drums. According to the sheet music published by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in common time, with a medium dance tempo of 132 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G minor, with Madonna's vocal range spanning from G3 to C5. The song has a basic sequence of Dm\u2013Gm\u2013E\u2013F\u2013Am\u2013Dm as its chord progression.", "While reviewing Hard Candy, Chris Williams from Entertainment Weekly complemented the song, saying that with \"tunes like 'Give It 2 Me' [Madonna's] unabashedly reviving the celebrative spirit of early singles like 'Lucky Star' and 'Holiday' filtering it through hip-hop's sonic boom.\" He also called it the most exciting club banger. Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe said that the song \"thumps relentlessly, euphorically, to the rhythm of a clanking virtual cowbell and freaky bass.\" Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle complimented the \"furious house grooves and thundering beats\" of the song. \"Give It 2 Me\" was compared by Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice, to the earlier Madonna song \"Material Girl\", and the music of producer Nile Rodgers. Pete Paphides of The Times noted how different Madonna sounded in songs like \"Give It 2 Me\", \"Dance 2Night\" and \"She's Not Me\" from the Hard Candy album. The song received negative feedback from Thomas Hauner of PopMatters, who said that \"[the] West-African inspired percussion bridge \u2014 airdropped onto the album and randomly landing at this point \u2014 completely disrupts the song's full potential.\" While ranking Madonna's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, Jude Rogers from The Guardian placed \"Give It 2 Me\" at number 59, calling it \"a half-annoying, half-brilliant EDM career manifesto\"."]}, {"page": "Chris Williams", "response": ["Chris Williams may refer to:", "*Chris Williams (basketball) (1980\u20132017), American basketball player", "*Chris Williams (cricketer, born 1983), English cricketer", "*Chris Williams (cyclist), Welsh cyclist", "*Chris Williams (Canadian soccer) (born 1981), Canadian soccer player", "*Chris Williams (English footballer) (born 1985), English professional footballer", "*Chris Williams (football manager) (born 1986), Australian football manager", "*Chris Williams (golfer) (born 1959), South African golfer", "*Chris Williams (defensive back) (born 1959), American football player", "*Chris Williams (defensive tackle) (born 1998), American football defensive tackle", "*Chris Williams (born 1968), American football defensive tackle; see 1991 Phoenix Cardinals season", "*Chris Williams (offensive lineman) (born 1985), American football offensive tackle", "*Chris Williams (wide receiver) (born 1987), American Canadian Football League (CFL) wide receiver", "*Chris Williams (actor) (born 1967), American actor and comedian", "*Chris Williams (bishop) (born 1936), Anglican bishop in Canada", "*Chris Williams (director) (born 1968), American film director", "*Chris Williams (journalist) (born 1951/52), editor of the Scottish Daily Mail", "*Chris Williams (academic), Welsh professor and historian"]}]}}
