In 2000 the federation declared that 2,800 people regularly attend the Sunday service, including 600 in Besan\u00e7on. In 2005 there were 4,000\u00a0members and 500\u00a0churchgoers at the Sunday worship in Besan\u00e7on, according to Fath.

He noted that criticism affected the church's growth; since 1988 the number of baptisms has fallen to about 50 a year, just enough to compensate for the number of people who leave the church.Amiotte-Suchet, 2006, p. 714.
