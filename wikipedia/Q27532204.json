Marion Dunlop was the first in 1909. She was released, as the authorities did not want her to become a martyr. Other suffragettes in prison also undertook hunger strikes. The prison authorities subjected them to force-feeding, which the suffragettes categorized as a form of torture. Emmeline Pankhurst's sister Mary Clarke died shortly after being force-fed in prison, and others including Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton are believed to have had serious health problems caused by force feeding, dying of a heart attack not long after. William Ball, a working class supporter of women's suffrage, was the subject of a pamphlet Torture in an English Prison not only due to the effects of force-feeding, but a cruel separation from family contact and mental health deterioration, secret transfer to a lunatic asylum and needed lifelong mental institutional care.

In 1912, it called a National Dock Strike in support of London dockers which was observed only in a few centres, and which ended within a week. This was regarded as an embarrassing setback, and led the Federation to adopt a more cautious approach in subsequent years. In 1921 it was criticised for failing to bring out its members in support of the miners in the Black Friday crisis."]}, {"page": "Men's League for Women's Suffrage (United Kingdom)", "response": ["In 1911 they successfully took Liberals in Bradford to court for assaulting Alfred Hawkins.

The group heard in March 1912, from speakers like George Lansbury, Mansell-Moullin and Victor Duval express their disgust at the treatment of William Ball a male suffrage supporter and hunger striker, not only force-fed but effectively driven to lunacy and separated from his family by the authorities.
