Born in London, he was educated at Oxford and Cambridge universities. He covered the wars in Kosovo and Afghanistan for various newspapers in the UK and abroad. He has also been the director of the democracy and conflict programme at the Foreign Policy Centre.\nHis publications include Special Effects (a novel), Understanding Iran (a report co-authored with Alex Bigham) and Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg, a biography of Abram Gannibal, the African soldier-scholar at the tsar's court who was also the great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin.He is currently the managing editor of Oblomovism Ltd, an independent consultancy focusing on Russia and the CIS, Eastern Europe and Central Asia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Pushkin", "response": ["Ossip Abramovich Gannibal's father, Pushkin's great-grandfather, was Abram Petrovich Gannibal (1696\u20131781), an African page kidnapped to Constantinople as a gift to the Ottoman Sultan and later transferred to Russia as a gift for Peter the Great. Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, that Gannibal was from the town of \"Lagon\". Largely on the basis of a mythical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law Rotkirkh, some historians concluded from this that Gannibal was born in a village called Geza-Lamza in the Seraye province of Mdre Bahri kingdom in todays Eritrea. Vladimir Nabokov, when researching Eugene Onegin, cast serious doubt on this origin theory. Later research by the scholars Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes eventually conclusively established that Gannibal was instead born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in modern-day Cameroon. After education in France as a military engineer, Gannibal became governor of Reval and eventually G\u00e9n\u00e9ral en Chef (the third most senior army rank) in charge of the building of sea forts and canals in Russia."]}, {"page": "Abram Petrovich Gannibal", "response": ["It was during his time in France that Abram adopted the surname \"Gannibal\" in honor of the Carthaginian general Hannibal (Gannibal being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian).Schmemann, Serge. \"Of African Princes and Russian Poets.\" The New York Times, November 12, 2010.

In his book, Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg, Hugh Barnes writes of meeting with the sultan of Logone-Birni, who gave him the same translation of the word. However, Frances Somers-Cocks, author of The Moor of St Petersburg: In the Footsteps of a Black Russian, met the same sultan and received a different translation for FVMMO. She also suggested that FVMMO stands for the Latin expression Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Omnino which means \"Fortune has changed my life entirely.\"", "Gnammankou's findings were in turn buttressed by the field work of Hugh Barnes. After consulting with the Sultan of Logone-Birni, Barnes found that an inscription on Gannibal's crest, which was hitherto undecipherable, corresponded with the term for \"homeland\" in the local Kotoko language of central Africa.", "* Gannibal: the Moor of Petersburg, by Hugh Barnes, hardback 2005. ."]}, {"page": "Dieudonn\u00e9 Gnammankou", "response": ["In 1996, he published a seminal biography of the Russian military leader Abram Petrovich Gannibal.
