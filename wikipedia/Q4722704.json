He played for Trowbridge Town before joining Small Heath in July 1900 as cover for the injury-prone Billy Bennett. During the 1900\u201301 season, Bennett was injured rather less than usual, so it was not until 16 February 1901 that Gard eventually made his Second Division debut, in a 3\u20131 home win against Barnsley. He deputised twice more for Bennett, but moved on to Southern League club Maidenhead at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trowbridge Town F.C.", "response": ["*Alfred Gard"]}]}}
