Four episodes were produced.  The very dark humour is about a man who after a bump on the head believes he must do everything the adverts tell him, with hilarious catastrophic results. The Independent wrote: \"It's not really a disaster but there's something decidedly uneven underfoot here, a feeling that this is the working model for a new type of comedy rather than the finished product. [...] while it's sustained with considerable energy by the actors and direction you have to doubt whether it really stands up for one episode, let alone four.\" Conversely, a retrospective review in The Guardian highlighted the series as \"a gem from an era when the BBC took its black comedy seriously\", praising both its dark content and humour, \"a Richard Briers sitcom that's the opposite of The Good Life.\" The series was only broadcast once and never repeated; according to The Guardian  ...\"possibly because it was too much of a leap for fans of The Good Life, but it has grown in cult status over the years.\""]}, {"page": "Dad (TV series)", "response": ["Toby Ross-Bryant played Alan's son Vincent, and Julia Hills played Alan's wife Beryl.
