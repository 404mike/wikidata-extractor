In 1976, he moved to the Los Angeles Skyhawks where he had the lowest goals against average (0.78) among American Soccer League goalkeepers for the league champions. His exploits led to him being nicknamed \"Superstop.\" He followed that in 1977 when he had the second lowest goals against average among ASL keepers. In 1980, he spent one season with the Miami Americans.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Los Angeles Skyhawks", "response": ["The Skyhawks managed to obtain the services of the renowned Ron Newman as their head coach, and he assembled a roster consisting of a number of young players from England's second and third divisions. Many of these players also had some limited first division experience; players such as goalkeeper Brian Parkinson (Everton), Midfielder Tony \"Wheels\" Whelan (Manchester City), Jimmy Rolland (Northwich Victoria), and forward Jimmy \"the Price\" Hinch (York), were the stars of the team. In addition, U.S. college player of the year Steve Ralbovsky (Brown University) spurned the N.A.S.L. and signed with the Skyhawks. The defense was anchored by 38-year-old sweeper and former Scottish International Ron Yeats (\"the Colussus\"), a veteran of the English First Division, where he was Liverpool's captain when Liverpool rose to glory in the 1960s. Hinch ended up as the A.S.L.'s leading scorer and Parkinson had the lowest goals against average (0.78) among A.S.L. goalkeepers. Led by these stars and a strong supporting cast, the Skyhawks had the league's best record (13 wins, 6 draws, 2 defeats) and regularly drew upwards of 4,000 fans per game, easily leading the ASL in attendance.", "After earning a first round bye, the Skyhawks faced the 2nd place Tacoma Tides, who had defeated Utah 2\u20131 in the first round. The Skyhawks took a 1\u20130 lead, but midway through the second half, goalkeeper Brian Parkinson suffered a head injury in a collision, and Tacoma equalized against backup keeper Marine Cano to force overtime. Facing the prospect of going into a penalty kick shootout without their #1 keeper, the Skyhawks won the game in the second 10-minute overtime period on a goal by Jimmy Rolland.", "The Skyhawks were again led offensively by Jimmy Hinch and Jimmy Rolland (who finished 2nd and 3rd in the league in scoring) and in goal by Brian Parkinson (who finished 2nd in GAA). While they couldn't duplicate their dominance of the 1976 season, they finished 2nd in the West and 4th overall with 13 wins, 4 draws, and 7 defeats. After a 3-2 first round playoff win over the California Sunshine, they lost to Western Division champion Sacramento in the Western Division playoff finals, 2\u20131.", "By 1978, the ASL was in severe financial difficulty, with every team losing money. On the field, the Skyhawks, led by ASL leading scorer and MVP Jimmy Rolland and goalkeeper Brian Parkinson (again 2nd in GAA), returned to the top of the Western Division and with a record of 17-6-1. They made it to the championship game for the 2nd time in 3 years, but lost in the final, 1\u20130 to the New York Apollo, who had the league's best record at 18-5-1.", "* 1976: Brian Parkinson"]}, {"page": "Marine Cano", "response": ["In 1976, Cano signed his first professional contract with the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League at the age of 21.
