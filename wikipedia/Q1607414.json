At any rate, Wilde was the first to publish, his paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Michael Faraday in 1866.The self-energising dynamo replaces the permanent magnets of previous designs with electro-magnets and in so doing achieved an enormous increase in power.  The machine was considered remarkable at the time, especially since Wilde was fond of spectacular demonstrations, such as the ability of his machine to cause iron bars to melt.", "link_mentions": {}}}
