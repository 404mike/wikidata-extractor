At any rate, Wilde was the first to publish, his paper was communicated to the Royal Society by Michael Faraday in 1866.The self-energising dynamo replaces the permanent magnets of previous designs with electro-magnets and in so doing achieved an enormous increase in power.  The machine was considered remarkable at the time, especially since Wilde was fond of spectacular demonstrations, such as the ability of his machine to cause iron bars to melt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Swan", "response": ["In 1894, Swan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), and in 1898 he was elected president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers; at the time, Swan was one of its three honorary members, the other two being Lord Kelvin and Henry Wilde. In September 1901, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from Durham University. He also served as president of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1901, and in 1903 he was chosen first president of the Faraday Society. In 1904, he was knighted, awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal, and made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society."]}, {"page": "Wilde", "response": ["* Henry Wilde (engineer) (1833\u20131919), British engineer and inventor of the self-energizing dynamo"]}, {"page": "Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)", "response": ["* 1900: Henry Wilde FRS 'for the discovery and practical demonstration of the indefinite increase of the magnetic and electric forces from quantities indefinitely small, a discovery now used in all dynamo machines; and for its application to the production of the electric search-light, and to the electro-deposition of metals from their solutions'"]}, {"page": "History of electromagnetic theory", "response": ["After Faraday's discovery that electric currents could be developed in a wire by causing it to cut across the lines of force of a magnet, it was to be expected that attempts would be made to construct machines to avail of this fact in the development of voltaic currents.See electric machinery, electric direct current, electrical generators. The first machine of this kind was due to Hippolyte Pixii, 1832. It consisted of two bobbins of iron wire, opposite which the poles of a horseshoe magnet were caused to rotate. As this produced in the coils of the wire an alternating current, Pixii arranged a commutating device (commutator) that converted the alternating current of the coils or armature into a direct current in the external circuit. This machine was followed by improved forms of magneto-electric machines due to Edward Samuel Ritchie, Joseph Saxton, Edward M. Clarke 1834, Emil Stohrer 1843, Floris Nollet 1849, Shepperd 1856, Van Maldern, Werner von Siemens, Henry Wilde and others."]}, {"page": "Wilde Professor of Mental Philosophy", "response": ["The position was initially established in 1898 as a readership by an endowment from the engineer Henry Wilde.

More important from the point of view of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit.The resonant frequency is very close to, but usually not exactly equal to, the natural frequency of oscillation of the circuit James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos,William Grove, \"An experiment in magneto\u2013electric induction\", Philosophical Magazine, vol 35, pp.184\u2013185, March 1868 and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866.
