A third defeat out of three matches came as Castleford won a ten try game 22\u201328, a result which meant Wigan's worst start to a season in twenty-four years. With Richards still missing due to injury, conversions proved to be the difference as both teams scored five tries apiece, but kickers Roberts and Riddell could only manage one successful kick whilst the Tigers' kicker Kirk Dixon managed four. Two disallowed Castleford tries in the first ten minutes were followed by two penalty goals by Dixon to give Castleford a 0\u20134 lead. Thomas Leuluai's effort gave Wigan a try before Joe Westerman put the Tigers ahead again after 34 minutes. Castleford scored again through Brett Ferres, with Dixon converting to give Castleford a 6\u201316 lead at half-time. Wigan scored first after the break thanks to a try from Karl Pryce, but this was unconverted and Castleford replied with two more of their own with Dixon and Ferres scoring his second try. Wigan started a fight back, initially through a Goulding try, and then again through Joel Tomkins. Ainscough marked his debut with a fifty-yard try to reduce the deficit to two points, but Michael Shenton's try sealed the victory for Castleford. Michael McIlorum was also cited and suspended by the Rugby Football League after the game for a dangerous throw on Mitchell Sargent. After failing to gain a point from the first three matches in the season, Noble's position as head coach was strengthened when Ian Lenagan publicly supported him, stating, \"Brian is a very experienced coach and I'm sure we'll get this right. He has had bad starts to the season before, and he has good starts.\""]}, {"page": "2009 Challenge Cup", "response": ["The local derby between Huddersfield and Castleford was the solitary game on the Sunday, due to BBC coverage. Huddersfield were fresh from a 48-point winning margin over Wakefield Trinity from the Super League round the week before, whilst Castleford had not won a match during regular time in four games. Despite the form book, it was Castleford who gained the early advantage thanks to an aerial take from Michael Shenton following Rangi Chase's kick, before crashing over the tryline on the way back down to give Castleford a 0\u20134 lead after three minutes. Several passages later, Kevin Brown dummied his way for a try in front of the uprights which was successfully converted by Brett Hodgson. Huddersfield had a disallowed try before Castleford kicked a penalty two minutes before half-time to make a 6\u20136 scoreline at the break. Huddersfield again had a try disallowed for a forward pass, before Brett Ferres scored his only try, and two Kirk Dixon goals gave the visitors a 6\u201314 lead after fifty minutes. Huddersfield did not concede again, and following a twenty-minute lull, scored a try thanks to Stephen Wild, which was successfully converted. Determined Castleford defending kept Huddersfield out for nine further minutes, before Danny Kirmond scored the match winning try in the 77th minute to send Huddersfield through to the semi-final stage."]}, {"page": "2009 Castleford Tigers season", "response": ["|Kirk Dixon"]}, {"page": "Super League XVI", "response": ["| Kirk Dixon || Castleford Tigers || 84", "| Kirk Dixon || Castleford Tigers || 7 || 84 || 0 || 196"]}, {"page": "2011 Wigan Warriors season", "response": ["Wigan's eight-match winning spree was toppled in the first rugby league match ever to be played at the Stade Yves-du-Manoir in Montpellier, after Daryl Millard's second try of the night handed Catalans Dragons a 20\u201312 victory.

Consequently, Origin match-winner Carmont and Sam Tomkins were both rested against Castleford, a match which Wigan looked to be comfortably winning with a 4\u201322 lead before a second half performance which Maguire described as \"unacceptable\" allowed the Tigers to come back, with Kirk Dixon missing a late-minute conversion meaning the match ended in Wigan's third draw of the season. The Warriors returned to winning ways against St Helens in the final derby game of the regular season with a 10\u201332 win at the Saints' temporary Stobart Stadium base, a result which took Wigan to the top of the Super League table before Huddersfield reclaimed the position the day after.
