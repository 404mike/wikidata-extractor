This was due to a flourishing tradition of folk dance, mummers plays and folk song, but also in part because of the rural nature of the county in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and yet its relatively close proximity to London. It was thus a rich and convenient place for the collectors of the first folk song revival, including Kate Lee, Lucy Broadwood and W. P. Merrick.W. P. Merrick, Folk Songs from Sussex (English Folk Dance and Song Society, 1953). Sussex material was used by the composers of the English pastoral school, for example in Percy Grainger\u2019s arrangement of \u2018The Sussex Mummers' Christmas Carol\u2019, Ralph Vaughan Williams' use of the tune \u2018Monk's Gate\u2019 as a setting for John Bunyan\u2019s \u2018To be a Pilgrim\u2019 and George Butterworth\u2019s arrangement of 'Folk Songs from Sussex'.J. R. Watson, T. Dudley-Smith, An Annotated Anthology of Hymns (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 108. Most important of the collector's sources were the Copper Family of Rottingdean, who emerged as authorities on folk song and eventually as major recording artists.Copper Family Website, http://www.thecopperfamily.com/index.html, retrieved 13/02/09. Sussex folk song also had a formative effect on one of the major figures of the second revival, as it was as a child of five in Sussex that A. L. Lloyd first heard folk music.E. D. Gregory, 'A. L. Lloyd and the English Folk Song Revival, 1934\u201344', Canadian Journal for Traditional Music (1997). Other performers include Scan Tester, Henry Burstow and the sisters Dolly and Shirley Collins. Sussex songs were also the foundation of the repertoire of the influential Young Tradition.Obituaries, 'Bob Copper', 1 April 2004, The Independent, .

Remembering that these were social dances, not a precious art form, gave licence to all sorts of creative cavorting. Of these new bands, Old Swan Band, Flowers and Frolics, Umps and Dumps, Pump and Pluck seemed to concentrate more on Southern English styles and repertoire.

Scan Tester's recordings were published posthumously in the 1990 album I Never Played to Many Posh Dances (sometimes misquoted as \"I Never Played Too Many Posh Dances\").  Tester was an accomplished musician, playing the concertina, melodeon, bandoneon and fiddle. Sisters Dolly and Shirley Collins from Hastings gained some popularity in the 1960s, producing the 1967 album of mainly Sussex tunes, The Sweet Primeroses as well as the 1969 album Anthems in Eden.  According to some commentators, many people believe that the folk-rock revolution of 1969 would not have happened without the album that Shirley Collins recorded with guitarist Davey Graham, released in 1964 as Folk Roots, New Routes\".  Shirley Collins founded the Etchingham Steam Band with her husband at the time Ashley Hutchings while they were living in Etchingham.  It was formed after the break-up of the Albion Country Band and ended with the formation in 1976 of the Albion Dance Band.  Founding Sussex's first folk club in 1958, Tony Wales also recorded the first LP of Sussex Folk Songs and Ballads in 1957 on the Folkways Records label in New York, and in 1961 organised the first Horsham Folk Festival."]}, {"page": "Culture of Sussex", "response": ["Sussex's rich musical heritage encompasses folk, classical and popular genres amongst others.
