Further revisions to these statistics increased this total to 20 destroyed and seven damaged with a further 13 destroyed and four damaged on the ground.Drake flew Hawker Hurricanes, Supermarine Spitfires and Curtiss P-40s (Tomahawks/Kittyhawks), with squadrons based in France, England, West Africa, North Africa and Malta.

In August 1941, Caldwell was attacked by two Bf 109s, one of them piloted by German ace Werner Schr\u00f6er. Although Caldwell was wounded three times and his Tomahawk was hit by more than 100  bullets and five 20 mm cannon shells, Caldwell shot down Schr\u00f6er's wingman and returned to base. Some sources also claim that in December 1941, Caldwell killed a prominent German Experte, Erbo von Kageneck (69 kills), while flying a P-40. Caldwell's victories in North Africa included 10 Bf 109s and two Macchi C.202s.Dragicevic, George. \"Clive 'Killer' Caldwell: Stuka Party\".  elknet.pl, 17 July 1999. Retrieved: 7 March 2006.

James \"Stocky\" Edwards (RCAF), who achieved 12 kills in the P-40 in North Africa, shot down German ace Otto Schulz (51 kills) while flying a Kittyhawk with No. 260 Squadron RAF. Caldwell, Drake, Edwards and Nicky Barr were among at least a dozen pilots who achieved ace status twice over while flying the P-40.Thomas 2002Molesworth 2000 A total of 46 British Commonwealth pilots became aces in P-40s, including seven double aces.", "*Billy Drake: RAF, the leading British P-40 ace, with 13 victories."]}, {"page": "Sutton Bridge", "response": ["RAF Sutton Bridge not only trained British combat pilots but also the RAF's commonwealth and foreign allied pilots, especially trainee Polish, Czech and French pilots. Many distinguished Second World War combat pilots passed through RAF Sutton Bridge training, such as Air Marshal Sir Richard Atcherley, Group Captain Billy Drake, Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader serving with No. 23 Squadron RAF and Dam Busters legend Wing Commander Guy Gibson. Along with RAF Sutton Bridge came also a stream of local crash landing incidents and mid-air collisions, many resulting in pilot fatalities.Example incident: 13 August 1943 mid-air collision over North-West Lakenheath in Suffolk, Stallode Fen farm, involving a Spitfire (P7530) and Wellington Bomber (P9228) on joint exercise both from RAF Sutton Bridge Central Gunnery School.  At the end of the Second World War, RAF Sutton Bridge was also used for dismantling aircraft such as the Vickers Wellington bomber, Avro Lancaster bomber and other British combat aircraft scheduled to be sold as scrap metal.Account of RAF Aircraft Engineer Joe Bosher (serving with No. 58 Aircraft Maintenance Unit RAF) stationed at RAF Sutton Bridge from late 1956. "]}, {"page": "Hans-Joachim Marseille", "response": ["Some serious discrepancies between Allied squadron records and German claims have caused some historians and Allied veterans to question the accuracy of Marseille's official victories, in addition to those of JG\u00a027 as a whole. Attention is often focused on the 26 claims made by JG\u00a027 on 1 September 1942, of which 17 were claimed by Marseille alone. A USAF historian, Major Robert Tate states: \"[f]or years, many British historians and militarists refused to admit that they had lost any aircraft that day in North Africa. Careful review of records however do show that the British [and South Africans] did lose more than 17 aircraft that day, and in the area that Marseille operated.\"Tate, Major Robert (USAF). \"Hans-Joachim Marseille\". Tate also reveals 20 RAF single-engined fighters and one twin engined fighter were destroyed and several others severely damaged, as well as a further USAAF P-40 shot down. However, overall Tate reveals that Marseille's kill total comes close to 65\u201370 percent corroboration, indicating as many as 50 of his claims may not have actually been kills. Tate also compares Marseille\u2019s rate of corroboration with the top six P-40 pilots. While only the Canadian James Francis Edwards' records shows a verification of 100 percent other aces like Clive Caldwell (50% to 60% corroboration), Billy Drake (70% to 80% corroboration), John Lloyd Waddy (70% to 80% corroboration) and Andrew Barr (60% to 70% corroboration) are at the same order of magnitude as Marseille's claims. Christopher Shores and Hans Ring also support Tate's conclusions. British historian Stephen Bungay gives a figure of 20 Allied losses that day."]}, {"page": "Prior Park College", "response": ["* Billy Drake, Battle of Britain fighter pilot"]}, {"page": "1917 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 20 December \u2013 Billy Drake, World War II fighter pilot (died 2011)"]}, {"page": "William Drake", "response": ["*Billy Drake (1917\u20132011), British RAF pilot"]}, {"page": "No. 112 Squadron RAF", "response": ["The squadron had many personnel from the air forces of Poland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
