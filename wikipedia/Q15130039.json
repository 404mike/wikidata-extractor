Kirk returned in 1935 to undertake a more complete excavation with A.E. Wellsford; she retained notes on the excavations which were eventually published by Ian Stead in 1959. Stead's report showed that the chariot burial was in a square-barrow, two iron wheels were excavated in their upright positions, and an iron bridle bit was also discovered. The wheels and bridle from this excavation were originally displayed in the York Castle Museum. They are now in the collection of the Yorkshire Museum."]}]}}
