Lewis' batting and bowling styles are unknown. He was christened at Holborn, London on 2 March 1816.\nLewis made his first-class debut for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture of 1837 at Lord's, where he batted last in the Gentlemen's first-innings and was dismissed for a duck by Sam Redgate, while in their second-innings he was absent hurt. Lewis later made a second first-class appearance nearly a decade later in 1846 for the Surrey Club against the Marylebone Cricket Club at The Oval. Opening the batting with J. Spenceley in the Surrey Club's first-innings, he was dismissed for 4 runs, stumped by William Nicholson off the bowling of William Hillyer. He followed this up in the Marylebone Cricket Club's first-innings by taking four wickets, the most by any Surrey Club bowler in that innings. Batting at number eight in their second-innings, Lewis was dismissed for a duck by Hillyer.He died at Sandown, Isle of Wight on 1 June 1882.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Lewis", "response": ["Thomas Lewis may refer to:", "*Thomas Lewis (English cricketer) (died 1882), English cricketer", "*Thomas Lewis (Australian cricketer) (1829\u20131901), Australian cricketer", "*Thomas Lewis (American football) (born 1972), American football wide receiver", "*Thomas Lewis (of Harpton) (1518/9\u20131607), British Member of Parliament for Radnorshire, 1559\u20131567 and 1584\u20131587", "*Thomas Lewis (by 1507 \u2013 1559 or later), MP for Wells", "*Thomas Lewis (died 1594), MP for Monmouth Boroughs", "*Thomas Lewis (died 1736) (c. 1679\u20131736), British Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Portsmouth, Salisbury and Winchester", "*Thomas Lewis (Welsh politician) (1821\u20131897), Liberal Member of Parliament for Anglesey", "*Thomas Lewis Jr. (1760\u20131847), U.S. Congressman from Virginia", "*Thomas Lewis (1690\u20131777), British Member of Parliament for Radnor, 1715\u20131761", "*Thomas Lewis (Kentucky politician) (1749\u20131809), State Senator, prominent figure in the development of Kentucky", "*Thomas Lewis (1821\u20131897) (1821\u20131897), Welsh-born Australian politician", "*Thomas Lewis (Bristol politician) (1871\u2013?), British trade unionist and politician", "*Thomas Lewis (activist) (1940\u20132007), artist and activist", "*Thomas Lewis (astronomer) (1856\u20131927), astronomer at the Greenwich Observatory", "*Thomas Lewis (footballer), Welsh international footballer in 1881", "*Thomas Lewis (unionist) (1866\u20131939), president of the United Mine Workers of America", "*Thomas Lewis (Virginia politician) (1718\u20131790), American surveyor, Virginia pioneer", "*Thomas Lewis (cardiologist) (1881\u20131945), British surgeon and cardiologist", "*Thomas Lewis (industrialist) (died 1764), cofounder of the Dowlais Ironworks in 1759", "*Thomas Lewis (RAF officer) (1894\u20131961), World War I flying ace", "*Thomas Lewis (controversialist) (1689\u2013?), English cleric", "*Thomas Lewis (organist) (died 1674), English organist"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Thomas Lewis"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Thomas Lewis"]}]}}
