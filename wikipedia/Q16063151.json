Lewis' batting and bowling styles are unknown. He was christened at Holborn, London on 2 March 1816.\nLewis made his first-class debut for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture of 1837 at Lord's, where he batted last in the Gentlemen's first-innings and was dismissed for a duck by Sam Redgate, while in their second-innings he was absent hurt. Lewis later made a second first-class appearance nearly a decade later in 1846 for the Surrey Club against the Marylebone Cricket Club at The Oval. Opening the batting with J. Spenceley in the Surrey Club's first-innings, he was dismissed for 4 runs, stumped by William Nicholson off the bowling of William Hillyer. He followed this up in the Marylebone Cricket Club's first-innings by taking four wickets, the most by any Surrey Club bowler in that innings. Batting at number eight in their second-innings, Lewis was dismissed for a duck by Hillyer.He died at Sandown, Isle of Wight on 1 June 1882.", "link_mentions": {}}}
