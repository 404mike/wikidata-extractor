She is Chair Professor of Global Englishes at the University of Southampton. She is a leading figure in the study of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), and is an expert on communication in English between non-native speakers. This is a relatively new field of study and her opinions are  sometimes seen as controversial. Her interests include attitudes to the international range of \"Englishes\", English as a lingua franca in higher education, and the implications of ELF for ways of teaching English as a foreign language.
