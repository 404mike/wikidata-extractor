However, he soon found his stride and went on to sign professionally for the club in July 1970, aged 17. A year later Nattrass went on to make his debut against Derby.\nThe then Newcastle manager Joe Harvey once commented \"Nattrass is my Paul Madeley and I can't pay him a bigger compliment than that\". Madeley was a Leeds and England player who was dubbed the \"Rolls Royce\" of footballers.\nHampered by injuries and disagreements with the Newcastle board he eventually moved to Middlesbrough for the sum of \u00a3375,000. Nattrass made his league debut for them against Arsenal on 15 September 1979.\nNattrass is now a successful businessman and keen golfer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["|1978|| Irving Nattrass"]}, {"page": "Fishburn", "response": ["*Irving Nattrass - Newcastle United Midfielder", "*Irving Nattrass Biography"]}, {"page": "Joe Harvey", "response": ["The last player Harvey signed at this time was John Tudor who was signed for a bargain \u00a3888 from Sheffield United and he proved to be an outstanding strike partner for Malcolm Macdonald.
