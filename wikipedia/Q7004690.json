He was educated in England at Winchester College, before going up to Trinity College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket on eight occasions for Oxford University in 1929. He was used largely by Oxford as an opening bowler, with his right-arm medium-fast capable of swinging both ways and coming off the pitch quickly. It was however as a batsman that Brett impressed, scoring 490 runs in his eight matches at an average of 40.83. He made one century score, with 106 against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI at Eastbourne. Featuring in a strong Oxford side that contained the likes of Ian Akers-Douglas, Neville Ford and the Nawab of Pataudi, his place was in constant doubt until his century seemingly cemented his place in the Oxford side for 1930. However, he was seriously injured in a car accident before the 1930 season and played no further first-class cricket. Brett died in December 1982 at Hook Heath, Surrey. His brother-in-law, James Guise, was also a first-class cricketer."]}]}}
