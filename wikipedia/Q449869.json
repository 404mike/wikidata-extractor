She claimed that the secret society's members were occultists, plotting communist world domination, through a Jewish cabal, the Masons and Jesuits. She blamed the group for events including the French Revolution, 1848 Revolution, the First World War, and the Bolshevik Revolution. Her writing influenced later conspiracy theories and ideologies, including American anti-communism (particularly the John Birch Society) and the militia movement.In 1920, Webster became a contributor to The Jewish Peril, a series of articles in the London Morning Post centered on the forged document The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. These articles were compiled and published in the same year in book form under the title of The Cause of World Unrest. Webster claimed that the authenticity of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was an \"open question\". Prior to World War II, Webster was involved in Fascist political groups in the United Kingdom.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Freemasonry", "response": ["Anti-Masonry (alternatively called Anti-Freemasonry) has been defined as \"opposition to Freemasonry\",\"Anti-Masonry\" \u2013 Oxford English Dictionary (Compact Edition), Oxford University Press, 1979, p. 369 but there is no homogeneous anti-Masonic movement. Anti-Masonry consists of widely differing criticisms from diverse (and often incompatible) groups who are hostile to Freemasonry in some form. Critics have included religious groups, political groups, and conspiracy theorists, in particular, those espousing Masonic conspiracy theories or the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory. Certain prominent Anti-Masons, such as Nesta Helen Webster (1876\u20131960), have exclusively criticized \"Continental Masonry\" while considering \"Regular Masonry\" an honorable association."]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1875\u20131939||data-sort-value=\"Webster, Nesta Helen\"|Nesta Helen Webster||United Kingdom||1876||1960||||"]}, {"page": "New World Order (conspiracy theory)", "response": ["During the interwar period of the 20th century, fascist propagandists, such as British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster and American socialite Edith Starr Miller, not only popularized the myth of an Illuminati conspiracy but claimed that it was a subversive secret society which served the Jewish elites that supposedly propped up both finance capitalism and Soviet communism in order to divide and rule the world. American evangelist Gerald Burton Winrod and other conspiracy theorists within the fundamentalist Christian movement in the United States\u2014which emerged in the 1910s as a backlash against the principles of Enlightenment secular humanism, modernism, and liberalism\u2014became the main channel of dissemination of Illuminati conspiracy theories in the U.S.. Right-wing populists, such as members of the John Birch Society, subsequently began speculating that some collegiate fraternities (Skull and Bones), gentlemen's clubs (Bohemian Club), and think tanks (Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission) of the American upper class are front organizations of the Illuminati, which they accuse of plotting to create a New World Order through a one-world government.", "Conspiracy theorists of the Christian right, starting with British revisionist historian Nesta Helen Webster, believe there is an ancient occult conspiracy\u2014started by the first mystagogues of Gnosticism and perpetuated by their alleged esoteric successors, such as the Kabbalists, Cathars, Knights Templar, Hermeticists, Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and, ultimately, the Illuminati\u2014which seeks to subvert the Judeo-Christian foundations of the Western world and implement the New World Order through a one-world religion that prepares the masses to embrace the imperial cult of the Antichrist. More broadly, they speculate that globalists who plot on behalf of a New World Order are directed by occult agencies of some sort: unknown superiors, spiritual hierarchies, demons, fallen angels or Lucifer. They believe that these conspirators use the power of occult sciences (numerology), symbols (Eye of Providence), rituals (Masonic degrees), monuments (National Mall landmarks), buildings (Manitoba Legislative Building) and facilities (Denver International Airport) to advance their plot to rule the world."]}, {"page": "Montague Summers", "response": ["According to Brian Doherty, Summers' later work on witchcraft, published in the 1930s and 1940s, \"adopted a far more paranoid and conspiracy-driven worldview\" than his earlier writings on the subject. These later writings draw extensively from earlier conspiracy theorists such as the French counter-revolutionary Abb\u00e9 Augustin Barruel and the English Fascist Nesta Helen Webster. As such, Summers' work may have influenced the \"Satanic Panic\" of the 1980s and 1990s."]}]}}
