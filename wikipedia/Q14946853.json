His parents, who married in 1929, were Geza Gryn (1900\u20131945), a timber merchant, and Bella Neufeld.Gryn\u2019s family were deported to Auschwitz in 1944. Hugo and his mother survived but his ten-year-old brother, Gabriel, was gassed on arrival at Auschwitz, while his father died a few days after he and Hugo were liberated from Gunskirchen, a sub-camp of Mauthausen, in May 1945.\nGryn moved to the United Kingdom in 1946, and was sent to board at the Polton House Farm School in Lasswade, near Edinburgh. He won a scholarship to study Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge, and after graduation volunteered to serve in the Israeli Army during the  1947\u20131949 Palestine war. In 1950 he moved to Cincinnati, where he earned several degrees in Hebrew scripture at the Hebrew Union College, a seminary for Reform rabbis.Upon receiving his doctoral degree Gryn was sent to Bombay by the World Union for Progressive Judaism, which had sponsored his studies, and following a spell working for the union in New York he returned to Britain in 1964, where he served in one of the largest congregations in Europe, the West London Synagogue, initially as assistant rabbi and later as senior rabbi, for 32 years.  Gryn became a regular radio broadcaster and appeared for many years on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day and The Moral Maze.\nIn 1989, Gryn returned to Berehovo together with his daughter Naomi to make a film about his childhood. After his death, Naomi Gryn edited his autobiography, also called Chasing Shadows, which deals movingly with his experiences as a Holocaust survivor.\nHe married Jacqueline Selby on 1 January 1957 and they had four children together: Gaby, Naomi, Rachelle and David.\nHe died of cancer on 18 August 1996 and is buried at Hoop Lane Cemetery in Golders Green, London. The grave lies in a relatively prominent location, just north-east of the main entrance. The Chief Rabbi at the time Jonathan Sacks refused to attend his funeral on principle. Sacks wrote in later leaked private correspondance that as part of reform, Rabbi Gryn was a part of a \"false grouping\" and one of \"those who destroy the faith\".He was described as \"probably the most beloved rabbi in Great Britain\" by Rabbi Albert Friedlander, who was also the author of the entry about Gryn in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Starkey", "response": ["Starkey entered a wider public awareness in 1992 on the BBC Radio 4 debate programme The Moral Maze, where he debated morality with his fellow panellists Rabbi Hugo Gryn, Roger Scruton and the journalist Janet Daley. He soon acquired a reputation for abrasiveness; he explained in 2007 that his personality possesses \"a tendency towards showmanship... towards self-indulgence and explosion and repartee and occasional silliness and going over the top.\" The Daily Mail gave him the sobriquet of \"the rudest man in Britain\", to which Starkey was said to have told friends, \"Don\u2019t worry darlings, it\u2019s worth at least \u00a3100,000 a year\", claiming that his character was part of a \"convenient image\". He once attacked George Austin, the Archdeacon of York, over \"his fatness, his smugness, and his pomposity\", but after a nine-year stint on the programme he left, citing his boredom with being \"Dr Rude\" and its move to an evening slot."]}, {"page": "Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion", "response": ["* Hugo Gryn, British rabbi and BBC radio broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Berehove", "response": ["*Rabbi Hugo Gryn (1930\u20131996) was born here on June 25, 1930 and became well known as a broadcaster in Britain."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Sacks, Baron Sacks", "response": ["Sacks provoked considerable controversy in the Anglo-Jewish community in 1996 when he refused to attend the funeral service of the late Reform Rabbi Hugo Gryn and for a private letter he had written in Hebrew, which (in translation) asserted that Auschwitz survivor Gryn was \"among those who destroy the faith\", was leaked and published.

On taking up his appointment as Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1989 he stepped down from the committee and was succeeded as moderator by David Silk, Archdeacon of Leicester (later Bishop of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia). Thompson was also co-chair of the Inter-Faith Network for the United Kingdom from its formation in 1987 until 1992. He enjoyed an excellent relationship with leading members of the various faith communities, not least of all with his co-chair, Holocaust survivor and fellow Thought for the Day presenter, Rabbi Hugo Gryn and with Zaki Badawi, Chair of the Imam and Mosques Council. Interfaith relations were becoming increasingly important in Britain's multi religious and multi cultural society.
