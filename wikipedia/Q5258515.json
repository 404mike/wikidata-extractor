He was the second of five sons, though only three survived to adulthood. In later life he became known by his middle name, Dennis, this being the maiden name of his maternal grandmother, Fanny Kendall. The Kendall family, who was well known in Ashby, was credited as the main instigators in bringing Primitive Methodism to the hamlet. Six of Dennis's maternal uncles were ordained ministers in this faith, along with a cousin, Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall. The Hird family were also Methodists and well known in the hamlet. Robert Hird was a grocer and Hird Terrace (no longer standing) was once named after the family. Primitive Methodism was a big influence in Dennis's early life and may be the spark for his socialist tendencies, as it was more favoured by the working classes of the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ruskin College", "response": ["In 1908, a group of Ruskin students, dissatisfied with its education policy which they viewed as too pro-establishment and imbued with elements of \"social control\", formed the Plebs' League.

He broached the idea of bringing Ruskin closer to the University, suggesting that this would involve the University providing funds for the College, and allowing Ruskin College students to join the University. Although this was warmly received by a couple of students, the bulk asked him what the University wanted in return. When he was unable to give a clear reply, the bulk of the students \u2013 drawing on their experience as trade union negotiators \u2013 became suspicious that the proposal would lead to the erosion of the college's independence. These concerns were vindicated when following a visit from Lord Curzon where the proposal was repeated and Dennis Hird, a lecturer in Sociology and Logic responded informing Curzon that as far as the students were concerned Ruskin College was irrevocably part of the Labour movement, which they envisaged making great changes in society presently. It subsequently transpired that certain members of the Ruskin College had been planning to sack Hird and to alter the curriculum by replacing Sociology and Logic with literature and temperance."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Oxford", "response": ["** March: Marxist students at Ruskin College, members of the Plebs' League, begin a strike in support of the dismissed Principal, Dennis Hird."]}, {"page": "Jonas \u0160li\u016bpas", "response": ["In 1909, \u0160li\u016bpas published the last third volume of the history of Lithuania that covered the period from the Union of Lublin (1569) to the Third Partition of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795).
