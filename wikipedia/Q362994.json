Unlike his more renowned brother, who went south on five occasions, Ernest Wild made only a single trip to the Antarctic, as a member of the Ross Sea party in support of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914\u201317.  He was one of the group of ten who were stranded ashore when the expedition's ship was blown from its moorings in a gale and were forced to improvise in order to survive. He played a full part in the party's main depot-laying journey, 1915\u201316, and in recognition of his efforts to save the lives of two comrades on that journey, he was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal. Having survived the expedition, he died while on active service with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean Sea on 10 March 1918 in what was then Bighi naval hospital, Kalkara, Malta and is buried at the British Naval Cemetery close by.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["Despite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the James Caird voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the Polar Medal; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were John Vincent, William Stephenson and Ernest Holness.Huntford 1975, p.\u00a0656. Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two\u2014Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham\u2014had been killed in action, and Ernest Wild, Frank's younger brother and member of the Ross Sea party, had died of typhoid while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry.Shackleton 1919, pp.\u00a0339\u2013341. Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in Murmansk, with the army rank of major.Fisher 1957, p.\u00a0432. This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition on , which left London on 17\u00a0September 1921.

Joyce was described by Shackleton's biographer, Roland Huntford, as \"a strange mixture of fraud, flamboyance and ability\",Huntford, p. 194. but his depot-laying work during the Nimrod Expedition had impressed Shackleton.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 21\u201322. On Nimrod, Joyce led the team that laid vital supplies for Shackleton's returning southern party, and Shackleton said \"Joyce knows his work well\".McOrist, p. 12. Ernest Wild, a Royal Naval petty officer, was added to the party possibly through the persuasion of his brother, Frank Wild, who was travelling as Shackleton's second-in-command on Endurance.Huntford, p. 414.", "Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. \"Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop\" fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco\u2014\"Hut Point Mixture\"\u2014was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August, Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: \"Tomorrow we start for Hut Point\".Bickel, p. 92.", "Shortly after the main march to Mount Hope began, on 1\u00a0January 1916, the failure of a Primus stove led to three men (Cope, Jack and Gaze) returning to Cape Evans,Tyler-Lewis, pp. 163\u2013164. where they joined Stevens. The scientist had remained at the base to take weather measurements and watch for the ship.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 143\u2013144. The remaining six sledged south, with Spencer-Smith failing rapidly and Mackintosh complaining of a painful knee.Bickel, p. 124. They battled on, laying the depots, using only minimum provisions themselves although, at Joyce's insistence, keeping the dogs well-fed: \"The dogs are our only hope; our lives depend on them.\"Bickel, p. 138. As they neared Mount Hope, Spencer-Smith collapsed, unable to proceed.Tyler-Lewis, p. 171. The others left him alone in a small tent and travelled the remaining few miles to lay the final depot at Mount Hope on 26\u00a0January. Ernest Wild left a letter for his brother Frank who he assumed was by then travelling across from the Weddell Sea with Shackleton.Huntford, p. 480.", "The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for \u00a310,000,Huntford, p. 642. and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. After leaving Newcastle, New South Wales on 20\u00a0June 1917, Aurora disappeared in the Pacific Ocean. On 2\u00a0January 1918, she was listed as missing by Lloyd's of London and presumed lost, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain.Tyler-Lewis, p. 274. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War.

The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure.Tyler-Lewis, p. 163 With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow blindness and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge.Tyler-Lewis, p. 171 Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, he had to be carried on the sledge.Bickel, p. 147 The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness,Tyler-Lewis, pp. 190\u2013193 led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He, Dick Richards and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, reaching his tent on March the 16th. Joyce wrote that evening \"Good going passed Smith's grave 10.45 + had lunch at Depot. Saw Skippers camp just after + looking through the glasses found him outside the tent much to the joy of all hands as we expected him to be down.\"McOrist, p. 298 The five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.Tyler-Lewis, p. 193", "Joyce tested the sea-ice on 18 April and found it firm, but the following day a blizzard from the south swept all the ice away.Bickel, p. 209 The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice and walk to Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: \"I fail to understand how these people are so anxious to risk their lives again\". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.", "He was in the public eye again in 1923 when he was awarded the Albert Medal for his efforts to save the lives of Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith during the 1916 depot-laying journey. Richards received the same award; Hayward, and Ernest Wild, who had died of typhoid during naval service in the Mediterranean in 1918, received the award posthumously. In 1929 Joyce published a contentious version of his diaries under the title The South Polar Trail,Published by Duckworth's, London 1929 in which he boosted his own role, played down the contributions of others, and incorporated fictitious colourful details.Tyler-Lewis, p. 259 Thereafter he indulged in various schemes for further expeditions, and wrote numerous articles and stories based on his exploits before settling into a quiet life as a hotel porter in London. Bickel's assertion that Joyce lived into his eighties, beyond the date (1958) of the first Antarctic crossing by Vivian Fuchs and his party,Bickel, p. 236 is not supported by any other source. Joyce died from natural causes, aged about 65, on 2 May 1940.Tyler-Lewis, p. 263 He is commemorated in Antarctica by Mount Joyce at ."]}, {"page": "Richard W.

They put down two depots in the late summer of 1915 and then, after the winter of 1915, they laid depots 70 miles apart, all the way to the Beardmore Glacier. Richards was the lone Australian with five Englishmen in the final depot laying party; called the \u201cMount Hope Party\u201d,  because the most southerly depot was placed at Mount Hope, 360 miles from their base at McMurdo Sound. The others in the party were Aeneas Mackintosh, Ernest Joyce, Arnold Spencer-Smith, Victor Hayward and Ernest Wild.

However, worn down by the preliminary work of hauling stores up to the base depot at Minna Bluff during the four-month period September\u2013December 1915, and the effects of scurvy, he was unable to sustain the physical effort required on the main depot-laying journey south, and collapsed before the Beardmore was reached. Thereafter he had to be carried on the sledge, unable to help himself and dependent on Ernest Wild for his most basic needs.Bickel, p.\u00a0143. The party nevertheless completed its depot-laying mission and struggled back northward in worsening weather conditions, each man growing weaker as scurvy took hold, and progress forward was with acute difficulty. Spencer-Smith, uncomplaining but in the latter stages occasionally delirious,Bickel, p.\u00a0182. died on the Barrier on 9\u00a0March 1916, aged\u00a032, two days before the safety of Hut Point was finally reached. He was buried in the ice.Bickel, p.\u00a0191.", "Spencer-Smith's condition, along with his expedition leader Aeneas Mackintosh, weakened well before the other man in their three-man hauling party, Ernest Wild. A logical reason why Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith succumbed to scurvy before Wild was their \"dislike\" of seal meat. At one time some freshly cooked seal meat was brought out for these three men when they were on the Barrier but Wild was the only man to take full advantage of this opportunity to eat fresh food. Both Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith exhibited their dislike of seal meat at this time, as they had before during the previous winter when at the Cape Evans hut.McOrist, p.\u00a0293. However, Spencer-Smith's health was poor. On 16\u00a0February 1915, in his early days of sledging he noted: \"I am a little strained on the left side intercostals, I hope, no heart, and shall have to be careful.\"McOrist, p.\u00a068. In August\u00a01915, before the second season of sledging started, Spencer-Smith was seen to be \"perfectly sound in body and limb\" but did have \"an intermittent heart\".
