He first became prominent after co-writing and featuring on the Gorillaz single \"Doncamatic\", having been spotted by the band's creator Damon Albarn early in his career as an underground artist on the UK music scene.\nDaley was promptly signed to Universal Music, and established himself as an international recording artist celebrated for songs including top five radio hit Alone Together  with Marsha Ambrosius (of Floetry), top ten single Look Up (produced by Pharrell Williams), Remember Me featuring Jessie J, and top ten single Until The Pain Is Gone featuring three time Grammy winner Jill Scott. He has received praise from The Grammys, BET, Billboard, Soul Train Awards and the MOBO Awards.\nThese releases span four projects including the Those Who Wait mixtape, Alone Together EP, and studio albums  Days & Nights and  The Spectrum - all of which incorporate elements of R&B, Soul, Pop, Funk, Alternative, electronic and orchestral arrangement, and showcase Daley's auto-biographical, personal lyrical style.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gorillaz", "response": ["Released on 3 March 2010, Plastic Beach debuted at #2 on both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 chart, the band's highest placing debut chart position.

To promote the album, the band embarked on the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour, the band's first world tour and also their first live performances in which the touring band performed fully in view of the audience on stage with no visual obstructions. The tour, which featured many of the collaborative artists from Plastic Beach and saw the touring band wearing naval attire, was later described by Albarn as having been extremely costly to produce, with the band barely breaking even on the shows, saying \"I loved doing it, but economically it was a fucking disaster.\" The tour was preceded by headline performances at several international music festivals, including the Coachella and Glastonbury festivals.
