After just one appearance in 1946, he moved to Bristol Rovers where after two goals and 25 consecutive appearances, injury led him to be released at the end of the season. Picked up by Colchester United in 1948, he made six appearances for the club before moving to King's Lynn.", "link_mentions": {}}}
