He was capped once by England U21.\nAfter retiring from playing in 2008, Grant has coached at a variety of clubs, most recently as assistant coach of SC East Bengal in the Indian Super League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robbie Fowler", "response": ["On 23 April 2019, it was announced by Australian Hyundai A-League club Brisbane Roar that Fowler had signed a two-year contract to act as the club's new head coach ahead of the forthcoming 2019\u201320 season. Upon his appointment, it was also announced that Tony Grant and Darren Davies would be joining his coaching staff, with Davies having acted as caretaker manager prior to Fowler's arrival. To mark the managerial contrast, Brisbane announced a major clear-out during the off-season, where fourteen senior players were released, notably marquee player Eric Bautheac. Fowler then made his first signing as a manager in June, when Roy O'Donovan signed from Newcastle United Jets."]}, {"page": "Andy Morrison", "response": ["Morrison's absence had prompted Royle to sign Spencer Prior to help City earn promotion, and subsequently Steve Howey and Richard Dunne to help the team stay in the top flight. Morrison returned to the City team in a League Cup game against Ipswich in December 2000. However, due to the number of yellow cards he had picked up in reserve-team games he could not play Premier League football until New Year's Day 2001, when he played in a 1\u20131 draw with Coventry City. In his next outing, an FA Cup game against Birmingham City, he scored with a bullet header in a 3\u20132 victory (Darren Huckerby and Shaun Goater scored the other goals for City). Morrison made two further appearances for City in the league: a 4\u20130 defeat to Leeds United and a 1\u20131 draw with Liverpool. In the latter, Morrison was replaced, by Andrei Kanchelskis (on loan from Rangers), at half time, due to a hamstring injury. Morrison was forced to withdraw from the squad, which drew 1\u20131 with Middlesbrough in early February, due to the same hamstring injury (he was replaced, in the squad, by Shaun Wright-Phillips). Morrison played in City's 1\u20130 victory against Coventry City in the fourth round of the FA Cup (in which Goater scored the only goal). Morrison also played in the fifth round of the FA Cup, against eventual winners Liverpool (which ended in a 4\u20132 defeat). Morrison was spoken to by a police officer for squirting water at a Liverpool fan after he had been replaced by Tony Grant. After the game, Royle dismissed speculation that Morrison had played his last game for the club. However, the defeat did prove to be Morrison's last appearance for City, as Royle became concerned about his injury record. Morrison was subsequently loaned out to Sheffield United, who were then managed by Neil Warnock. Morrison played alongside another former Manchester City captain, Keith Curle, in defence at Sheffield United. The wisdom of allowing Morrison to be loaned out was questioned when Howey suffered an injury whilst playing for City. Morrison made his debut for Sheffield United in a 4\u20131 defeat to Gillingham. He came on as a substitute, replacing Gus Uhlenbeek, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon in United's next game, in which he almost scored a late equaliser."]}, {"page": "Billy Jones (footballer, born 1987)", "response": ["Jones played 20 league and two League Cup games during the 2004\u201305 season, but cemented his place as a first-team regular in the 2005\u201306 season, making 46 appearances and scoring seven goals as Crewe were relegated from the Football League Championship. Jones played in central midfield for most of the season before moving to a left-back role following the signing of midfielder Tony Grant during the January transfer window.
