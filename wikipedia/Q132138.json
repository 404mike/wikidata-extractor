There was a romantic tendency toward the exploration of folk traditions and old legends. In 1802 Sir Walter Scott published Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. Amelia Opie, another romantic, was publishing poetry in the early 19th century and was an active anti-war campaigner. Anne Bannerman (1765\u20131829) reworked legends of King Arthur and Merlin. William Blake worked in words and pictures to share his visions and mysticism. In 1807 Thomas Moore published Irish Melodies. Lord Byron produced many influential poems during this period. In 1808 Goethe published part one of Faust. In 1810 Sir Walter Scott published Lady of the Lake. Percy Shelley published a gothic novel: Zastrozzi. The term \"Gothic\" had, by this time, come to mean a desire for a romantic return to the times before the renaissance. Percy Shelley also published a gothic novella: St. Irvyne in 1811."]}, {"page": "1802 in poetry", "response": ["* Anne Bannerman, Tales of Superstition and Chivalry, Scottish Gothic ballad collection"]}, {"page": "Bannerman (surname)", "response": ["*Anne Bannerman (1765\u20131829), Scottish poet"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish poets", "response": ["*Anne Bannerman"]}, {"page": "Tales of Superstition and Chivalry", "response": ["thumb|Title page, Anon.
