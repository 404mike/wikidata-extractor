He was however re-signed on a pay-as-you-play deal by Chris Brass in December, and was described as looking \"surprisingly sharp\" as he kept a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw at Fleetwood Town on Boxing day. The next month he signed a contract to keep him at the club until the end of the 2016\u201317 season. However he picked up another injury and lost his first team place to new signing Joe Murphy. On 7 April 2017, he joined Gary Johnson's Cheltenham Town on a seven-day emergency loan deal, as Calum Kitscha was injured and loanee Scott Brown was unavailable to play against his parent club Wycombe Wanderers. He did not feature at Bury after Lee Clark was appointed manager in February, and was released by the club for a second time three months later."]}, {"page": "Rhys Lovett", "response": ["Lovett spent seven years in Walsall's academy, where he had loan spells at Aston Villa and Coventry City, before joining Rochdale permanently in 2014.

Following this, Lovett immediately joined Southern League Division One South & West club Tiverton Town on a short-term loan deal. He made his competitive debut on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 season, a 2\u20130 defeat at North Leigh. He played the next three games for Martyn Rogers's \"Yellows\". He joined Shepton Mallet on a one-month loan on 19 December 2015.
