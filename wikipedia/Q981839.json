Ayer", "response": ["In Language, Truth and Logic (1936), Ayer presents the verification principle as the only valid basis for philosophy.  Unless logical or empirical verification is possible, statements like \"God exists\" or \"charity is good\" are not true or untrue but meaningless, and may thus be excluded or ignored.  Religious language in particular was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion\"Representation and Expression,\" Analysis, Vol.1, No.3; \"Metaphysics and Emotive Language,\" Analysis Vol. II, nos. 1 and 2, that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.Ayer A. J. Language, Truth and Logic 1946/1952, New York/Dover The stance that a belief in \"God\" denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as igtheism (for example, by Paul Kurtz). In later years Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God\"I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it.\" Ayer, A.J. (1966). \"What I Believe,\" Humanist, Vol.81 (8) August, p. 226. and began to refer to himself as an atheist.\"I trust that my remaining an atheist will allay the anxieties of my fellow supporters of the British Humanist Association, the Rationalist Press Association and the South Place Ethical Society.\" (Ayer 1989, p. 12) He followed in the footsteps of Bertrand Russell by debating with the Jesuit scholar Frederick Copleston on the topic of religion."]}, {"page": "David Hume", "response": ["A Treatise of Human Nature begins with the introduction: \"'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature.\u2026 Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man.\" The science of man, as Hume explains, is the \"only solid foundation for the other sciences\" and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument. In regards to this, philosophical historian Frederick Copleston (1999) suggests that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply natural philosophy), and that \"Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of Newtonian physics.\"Copleston, Frederick. 1999 [1960].

While existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was Sartre. Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that existence precedes essence,\" as the philosopher Frederick Copleston explains. According to philosopher Steven Crowell, defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better understood as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself. In a lecture delivered in 1945, Sartre described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent atheism.\"See James Wood. 2000. \"Introduction.\" Pp. iv\u2013ix in Nausea, by Jean-Paul Sartre. London: Penguin Classics. . p.\u00a0vii. For others, existentialism need not involve the rejection of God, but rather \"examines mortal man's search for meaning in a meaningless universe,\" considering less \"What is the good life?\" (to feel, be, or do, good), instead asking \"What is life good for?\""]}, {"page": "Pythagoras", "response": ["According to R. M. Hare, Plato's Republic may be partially based on the \"tightly organised community of like-minded thinkers\" established by Pythagoras at Croton. Additionally, Plato may have borrowed from Pythagoras the idea that mathematics and abstract thought are a secure basis for philosophy, science, and morality. Plato and Pythagoras shared a \"mystical approach to the soul and its place in the material world\" and it is probable that both were influenced by Orphism. The historian of philosophy Frederick Copleston states that Plato probably borrowed his tripartite theory of the soul from the Pythagoreans. Bertrand Russell, in his A History of Western Philosophy, contends that the influence of Pythagoras on Plato and others was so great that he should be considered the most influential philosopher of all time. He concludes that \"I do not know of any other man who has been as influential as he was in the school of thought.\""]}]}}
