Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop tweeted: \"Hard left joining with far right in welcoming dictators \"liberating\" Aleppo. Absolute disgrace\". Other Labour MPs joining in the criticism were Stephen Doughty, Angela Smith, Ian Austin, Mike Gapes, Jess Phillips, Toby Perkins and Wes Streeting.

Stop the War Coalition convener Lindsey German, and political commentator Peter Oborne defended the Star reporting of the issue, and questioned the dominant media narrative, respectively. Jeremy Corbyn said he \"disagreed\" with the headline, emphasising that he always advocated a ceasefire and \"a political settlement in Syria\".
