According to Liutprand of Cremona and the Liber Pontificalis, John's father was not Alberic but Marozia's lover Pope Sergius III. Ferdinand Gregorovius, Ernst D\u00fcmmler, Thomas Greenwood, Philip Schaff, and Rudolf Baxmann accept Liutprand's account. Horace Kinder Mann considers this story \"highly doubtful\", highlighting Liutprand's bias. Reginald L. Poole, Peter Llewelyn, Karl Josef von Hefele, August Friedrich Gfr\u00f6rer, Ludovico Antonio Muratori, and Francis Patrick Kenrick also maintain that Pope John XI was sired by Alberic I of Spoleto."]}, {"page": "Thomas Greenwood", "response": ["Thomas Greenwood may refer to:", "* Thomas Greenwood (activist) (1908\u20131988), American labor and Indian affairs activist", "* Thomas Greenwood (historian) (1790\u20131871), English barrister and academic", "* Thomas Greenwood (publisher) (1851\u20131908), English publisher"]}, {"page": "Royal Commission on the Inns of Court", "response": ["The Royal Commission on the Inns of Court was established in 1854.  Its remit included both the Inns of Court and the Inns of Chancery and its stated terms were to: \"inquire into the arrangements of the Inns of Court, for promoting the study of Law and Jurisprudence, the revenues properly applicable to that purpose, and the means most likely to secure a systematic and sound education of students of Law, and provide satisfactory tests of fitness for admission to the Bar\".  The eleven commissioners appointed to the commissioner were: Sir William Page Wood, Sir John Taylor Coleridge, Joseph Napier, Sir Alexander Cockburn, Sir Richard Bethell, Sir Thomas Erskine Perry, John Shaw-Lefevre, Henry Singer Keating, Thomas Greenwood, James Stewart and Germain Lavie. Stewart seems to have had little involvement, not attending any meetings or signing the report when it was issued on 10 August 1855.  The secretary was Julius Talbot Airey who received a 150 guinea allowance for his services."]}]}}
