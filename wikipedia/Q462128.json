With only Yugoslavia left to vote, the UK was in first place with 136 points followed by Switzerland with 131. The Yugoslav jury proceeded to award Switzerland six points and after that it seemed highly likely that the UK would be given one of the higher remaining set of points. However as Yugoslavia announced its seven, eight, ten and twelve points, it transpired that it had awarded the UK no points at all, as the Yugoslav jury awarded its 12 points to France, leaving Switzerland with a one-point lead and allowing them to savour a dramatic victory.", "\"Go\" was a minor hit in the UK charts.Chart Archive - Scott Fitzgerald"]}]}}
