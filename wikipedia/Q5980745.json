He was a right-handed batsman who played first-class cricket for Oxford University and Kent County Cricket Club between 1929 and 1938. He was born in Kensington and died at his home in Frant.Akers-Douglas' father was the second son of Aretas Akers-Douglas, 1st Viscount Chilston. His maternal grandfather was Stanley Christopherson, who played cricket once for England, and his great-uncle was Percy Christopherson who played twice for Kent. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. His cricketing career began with one match for the Kent Second XI in the 1928 Minor Counties Championship before making his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1929. He played in three matches for the university before making his Kent debut in the same summer against Warwickshire. He played four further County Championship matches for the team in the 1929 season.\nAkers-Douglas returned to play for Oxford in 1930 and made four appearances for Kent in the County Championship during the 1930 season. He spent 1931 and 1933 out of the team, save for one single first-class match, though 1932 saw him score his debut century for the side, his career-best first-class score of 123. He played frequently during 1934 and 1936, but in 1935, 1937 and 1938 played just a single first-class game in each year. Following the close of the 1938 season, Akers-Douglas played just one further cricket match for Kent, against the Rest of England.\nAkers-Douglas was also a champion rackets player. He won the British Open Championship in 1933 and the British Amateur Championship in 1933, 1933 and 1934, and was runner-up in the Amateur Championship in 1930, 1931, 1935, 1938 and 1946.Akers-Douglas was married twice. His first marriage, to Joan Holroyd Toms, in 1933, produced a daughter, and ended in divorce in 1943. He married Phyllis Rosemary Parsons in 1945, and they had a son and a daughter. He died as a result of a shooting accident at his home in December 1952. His cousin Eric Akers-Douglas, 3rd Viscount Chilston, died in 1982 without children, so Ian Akers-Douglas' son Alastair (born 1946) became 4th Viscount Chilston.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Douglas (surname)", "response": ["* Ian Akers-Douglas (1902\u20131952), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Stanley Christopherson", "response": ["An arm injury in 1886 meant that he played little top-class cricket after 1887, although he made his final Kent appearances in 1890.

Colin Cowdrey captained the side a total of 250 times in first-class cricket and held the position for 15 years, the most of any player since the establishment of the County Championship. At times there have been multiple captains during a season or joint captains appointed. William Patterson, for example, captained the side five times during the 1891 and 1892 seasons towards the end of each season, the only times he was able to play regularly for the county during those seasons. For the majority of both seasons the official club captain was Frank Marchant. Similarly, Ian Akers-Douglas was the club captain for five games in the 1936 season. Akers-Douglas only captained Kent for seven matches in total, the fewest of any of the official club captains.Reid J (ed) (2016) \"Captains of Kent\" in 2016 Kent County Cricket Club Annual, p. 232.

He was educated in England at Winchester College, before going up to Trinity College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he played first-class cricket on eight occasions for Oxford University in 1929. He was used largely by Oxford as an opening bowler, with his right-arm medium-fast capable of swinging both ways and coming off the pitch quickly. It was however as a batsman that Brett impressed, scoring 490 runs in his eight matches at an average of 40.83. He made one century score, with 106 against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI at Eastbourne. Featuring in a strong Oxford side that contained the likes of Ian Akers-Douglas, Neville Ford and the Nawab of Pataudi, his place was in constant doubt until his century seemingly cemented his place in the Oxford side for 1930. However, he was seriously injured in a car accident before the 1930 season and played no further first-class cricket. Brett died in December 1982 at Hook Heath, Surrey. His brother-in-law, James Guise, was also a first-class cricketer."]}, {"page": "Kenneth Wagg", "response": ["Wagg became a noted player of rackets while at Eton. Wagg formed a doubles partnership with Ian Akers-Douglas. He and Akers-Douglas won the Public Schools championship of 1927 and the Noel Bruce Cup in 1932. The pair were victorious in the national Amateur Doubles championship of 1932, 1933 and 1935. Wagg was part of the inaugural British rackets tour of the United States following the Second World War. He was victorious in the Army rackets tournament with Cosmo Crawley. Wagg reached the semi-finals of the British rackets championship in 1952, also winning the US doubles title that year. Wagg and Geoffrey Atkins lost the final of the US doubles in 1953. In 1958 Wagg won the US doubles title with Atkins. The New York Times described the match as \"one of the most remarkable feats recorded on a rackets court\" as Wagg and Atkins came back from 7\u20130 in the first game with \"the greatest single hand of rackets within memory\" as their opponents, the American players Robert Grant and Clarence Pell, \"found themselves helpless against the absolute perfection, cleverness and finality of the British pair\". Wagg and Atkins won the US doubles championship again in 1961 and won the individual Canadian title in 1960."]}]}}
