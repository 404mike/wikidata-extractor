He was born in 1492, the son of one James Winram of Ratho and his wife Margaret Wilkie. He obtained a Bachelor's Degree (1515), a Master's Degree (x 1532) and a Doctorate (1541) from St Leonard's College, University of St Andrews.\nHe had become an Augustinian monastic canon at St Andrews Cathedral Priory by 1527, becoming sub-prior by the end of 1535. By then, he was de facto leader of the house, since the commendator-prior was James Stewart, born only in 1531 and still a minor. In 1553 he was appointed to be Prior of St Serf's Inch, Lochleven.\nIn his roles at St Andrews and St Serf's Inch, he was able to exert an influence on the national church. He was a keen reformer, but it was not until the Scottish Reformation came fully into being that he accepted a break with the Roman Catholic Church. Winram played a leading role in the early organisation of the newly independent Scottish Church, maintaining a high work-load as an administrator into his 80s.\nWinram had married Margaret Stewart, the illegitimate daughter of Alexander Stewart, Bishop of Moray, in 1562. By this marriage he obtained two stepsons, Robert and Andrew. The former suffered from severe disability, though the latter was healthy and he and Winram had a mutually beneficial relationship until the death of Margaret led to a dispute about her will. The dispute raged through the courts of south-eastern Scotland, and their relationship never recovered. Winram died on 28 September 1582. He was buried in the chapel of St Leonard's College.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Willock", "response": ["with the drawing up of the First Book of Discipline, the others being John Knox, John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Douglas, and John Row.

In 1565 Queen Mary endeavoured to put a stop to his activity by having him imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle; but the Reformers were now too strong for her, and she had to depart from her purpose."]}, {"page": "Scots Confession", "response": ["In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland agreed to reform the religion of the country. To enable them to decide what the Reformed Faith was to be, they set John Knox as the superintendent over John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Willock, John Douglas, and John Row, to prepare a Confession of Faith. This they did in four days. The 25 Chapters of the Confession spell out a contemporary statement of the Christian faith as understood by the followers of John Calvin during his lifetime. Although the Confession and its accompanying documents were the product of the joint effort of the Six Johns, its authorship is customarily attributed to John Knox."]}, {"page": "Book of Discipline (Church of Scotland)", "response": ["The Lords had intended for the parliament to consider a Book of Reformation, that they had commissioned and which was largely the work of John Knox. However, they were unhappy with the document and established a committee of \"six Johns\", including Knox, John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Willock, John Douglas and John Row, to produce a revised version.  While Knox, Spottiswood and Willock were long committed Protestants, Windram, Douglas and Row had until recently been pillars of the Catholic establishment and the composition of the committee may have been intended as a compromise. However, the members worked well together and produced a radical plan for church reform.J. Dawson, John Knox (Yale University Press, 2015), , p. 200. The result of the delay was that the document, known as the First Book of Discipline was not considered by the full parliament, but a thinly attended convention of nobles and about 30 lairds, in January 1561 and then only approved individually and not collectively.M.

The Book proposed a programme of parish-based reformation that would use the resources of the old Church to pay for a network of ministers, a parish-based school system, university education, and poor relief. However, this proposal for the use of church wealth was rejected. Instead, an Act of Council kept two-thirds of the Church's assets in the hands of its existing holders, while the remaining third was divided between the Crown and the reformist measures. The educational programme, was abandoned, ministers remained poorly paid, and the Church was underfunded."]}, {"page": "Scottish Reformation Parliament", "response": ["A Reformed confession of faith was drafted by six ministers: John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Willock, John Douglas, John Row and John Knox.

Kerr says: \"It was through Craig being at St. Gile's that Knox had greater freedom of movement to prosecute his missionary work than he otherwise would have had.\" The pastoral work was divided in two and both preachers undertook tours to strengthen their cause in other parts of the country: Knox in Nithsdale, Galloway and Kyle in autumn 1562, and Craig in Jedburgh the following year. They were later able to leave Edinburgh simultaneously for example in 1564 when Craig went back to the Merse churches for a month while Knox engaged in similar work north of the Forth. The two men supported each other in public life too. Knox was pleased by Craig's outspokeness against the nobility and called him \"that worthy servant of God\", approving is his public rebuke of courtiers. Craig supported Knox in the General Assembly too. In the debate about church and state relations, around the topic of the Queen's Mass, as Knox argued for denying the queen the Mass, with Craig providing supporting arguments on resisting rulers, whereas John Winram and John Douglas would have allowed her to celebrate it."]}, {"page": "John Rough", "response": ["He acquired such reputation as a reformist Catholic preacher that in 1543, after the arrest of Cardinal Beaton, the regent Arran procured a dispensation for him to leave the monastery so that he might become one of his chaplains. The entry in the treasurer's accounts for February 1543 of payment for a gown, doublet, hose, and bonnet for him as chaplain of the lord-governor, probably indicates the date when he first entered upon his duties. At their request the governor allowed him and Thomas Gwilliam (or Williams) to preach publicly against current errors and abuses. Both were very effective. Rough, although according to Knox \u2018not so learned\u2019 as Williams, was \u2018yet more simple and vehement against all impiety\u2019  The preaching roused the special indignation of the Franciscans, who, according to Knox, \u2018rouped as they had been ravens, yea, rather they yelled like devils in hell \u201cheresy ! heresy ! Gwilliam and Rough will carry the governor to the devil\u201d\u2019. On account of the advice, as is supposed, of John Hamilton, Abbot of Arbroath, and David Panter (afterwards bishop of Ross), who had arrived from France, they were both prohibited from preaching; and Rough took refuge in the wild districts of Kyle in Ayrshire, where he remained until after the murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546. By this date he had broken completely with Catholicism. After the murder Rough came to St. Andrews, and, besides acting as chaplain to the garrison in the castle, began to preach in the parish church. Here he met John Knox, whom in a sermon he publicly exhorted to undertake the office of a preacher; and Knox, who had been a disciple of George Wishart, and who at this time had brought the aid of his vigorous pen to the support of the teaching of Rough in opposition to Dean Annand of St. Andrews, was at last induced to preach in the parish church his first sermon against the \u2018corruptions of the Papistry\u2019. Knox's irregular call was approved by the congregation. Knox and Rough were soon summoned before John Winram, the Catholic vicar-general of St. Andrews, but their defence was conducted by Knox with such skill as completely to confound their adversaries.
