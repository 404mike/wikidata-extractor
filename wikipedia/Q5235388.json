Manson has cited Queen as an influence on the band's more melodic work, while new wave and synthpop acts such as Depeche Mode and Gary Numan have been noted as influencing their electronic material. Manson said of the latter, \"I was always into his apocalyptic fiction lyrics. He pioneered electronic dance music.\" The work of gothic rock acts such as The Cure and Bauhaus has also been cited, with Twiggy saying that \"as far as guitar and bass combinations go\", Bauhaus's Daniel Ash and David J were \"a really big influence\".

The group consists of Daniel Ash (guitar, saxophone), Peter Murphy (vocals, occasional instruments), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass). The band was originally named Bauhaus 1919 in reference to the first operating year of the German art school Bauhaus, although they shortened the name within a year of formation. One of the pioneers of gothic rock, Bauhaus were known for their dark image and gloomy sound, although they mixed many genres, including dub, glam rock, psychedelia, and funk. ", "After Bauhaus' breakup, Murphy formed Dalis Car with Japan's bassist Mick Karn before beginning a solo career later on, while Ash and Haskins continued as Tones on Tail and, later, reunited with David J to form Love and Rockets. Both enjoyed greater commercial success in the United States than Bauhaus had, but disappeared from the charts in their homeland. Bauhaus eventually reunited for a 1998 tour, again from 2005 to 2008, and once again in 2019.", "Daniel Ash, his friend David J. Haskins, and Haskins' younger brother Kevin, had played together in various bands since childhood. Ash initially tried to convince his school friend Peter Murphy to be in a band, but nothing came out of it. According to Ash: \"Pete didn\u2019t think about it at all, it wasn\u2019t on his mind as such.\" One of the longer-lived of these was a band called the Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought he had the right look for a band. Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided to give it a try, despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song \"In the Flat Field\".", "Ash's old bandmate Kevin Haskins joined as the drummer. Ash made a point of not inviting David J, the driving force in their previous bands, because he wanted a band he could control. Instead, Chris Barber was brought in to play bass, and together the four musicians formed the band S.R. However, within a few weeks Ash relented, and replaced Barber with David J, who suggested the new name Bauhaus 1919. David J. had already agreed to tour American airbases with another band, but decided that joining his friends' group was \"the right thing to do\". With their lineup complete, the band played their first gig at the Cromwell pub in Wellingborough on New Year's Eve 1978.", "The band had chosen the name Bauhaus 1919, a reference to the German Bauhaus art movement of the 1920s, because of its \"stylistic implications and associations\", according to David J. The band also chose the same typeface used on the Bauhaus college building in Dessau, Germany, as well as the Bauhaus emblem, designed by Oskar Schlemmer. Bauhaus associate Graham Bentley said that the group was unlike any Northampton band of the time, most of which played predominantly cover songs. Bentley videotaped a performance by the group, which was sent to several record labels, in the hope of obtaining a contract. This approach was hindered partly because many record companies at the time did not have home video equipment, so the group decided to record a demo.", "Prior to the recording of their fourth album, Burning from the Inside (1983), Murphy was stricken with pneumonia, which prevented him from contributing much to the album. Ash and David J took the reins, becoming the driving forces behind the record and even performing lead vocals on several tracks. The album's lead single, \"She's in Parties\", reached No. 26 on the charts and earned Bauhaus their third and final Top of the Pops appearance. Bauhaus then embarked on an international promotional tour for the album, with dates in Europe and the Far East. David J recalled that the night before they were supposed to perform two shows at Hammersmith Palais in London, the group decided to disband.", "The band played their farewell show on 5 July 1983 at the Hammersmith Palais; dedicated fans had been warned by the band's crew not to miss the show, without telling them it was the last. After a long encore, consisting of some of their early songs, David J left the stage with the words \"rest in peace\". Burning from the Inside was released a week later. The album received largely positive reviews and reached No. 13 on the charts. Bauhaus released the single \"Sanity Assassin\" in limited quantities as a farewell gift for those who joined the group's fan club.", "After Bauhaus disbanded, the members of the band moved on to various solo work. Murphy worked briefly with bassist Mick Karn of Japan in the band Dalis Car, before going solo with such albums as 1986's Should the World Fail to Fall Apart, 1988's Love Hysteria and 1989's Deep. Ash had already started Tones on Tail with Bauhaus roadie Glen Campling as a side project in 1982; after Bauhaus broke up, Kevin Haskins joined the group, and the trio released an album and several EPs before breaking up after a 1984 American tour. During this time, David J released two solo albums and collaborated with other musicians, recording two albums with the Jazz Butcher, and also with comics writer/spoken-word artist Alan Moore in the short-lived band the Sinister Ducks.", "During a discussion about the state of their projects at the time, Ash and David J began talking about reforming Bauhaus. All four band members arranged a rehearsal, but Murphy failed to show up on the scheduled day. The other three band members rehearsed regardless, and were inspired by the chemistry they had as a trio. As a result, Ash and the Haskins brothers formed Love and Rockets in 1985. Love and Rockets scored a US hit four years later with \"So Alive\". The band broke up in 1999 after seven albums. Both Ash and David J released solo albums during the Love and Rockets years; Murphy contributed backing vocals to David J's 1992 single \"Candy on the Cross\".", "In 2008, Bauhaus released their first new studio album since 1983, Go Away White (Cooking Vinyl). It marked the band's end and the album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said \"We were getting along really well, but there was an incident that occurred,\" and added that as a result, \"Some of us just felt that we didn't want to carry on as a working unit.\" In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he \"was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable\", but in the end, \"that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really\". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: \"You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer\".", "In 2018, Murphy and David J announced a tour of New Zealand, Australia and Europe to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Bauhaus, with the pair performing In the Flat Field in its entirety.", "According to David J, the bands Bauhaus related to in the post-punk scene were Joy Division, Pere Ubu, Devo, Gang of Four, Cabaret Voltaire, and the Pop Group. Among bands and singers who influenced Bauhaus, they cited Siouxsie and the Banshees, David Bowie, T-Rex, Roxy Music, New York Dolls, Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop and The Stooges, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Residents, Captain Beefheart, Suicide, Kraftwerk, Can, Faust, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Serge Gainsbourg, Scott Walker, and Jacques Brel. Specific recordings that were influential on the band include the compilation album Nuggets, the Bits and Pieces single by The Dave Clark Five and the Double Barrel single by Dave and Ansell Collins. In terms of live performances, Bauhaus' stage theatrics, specifically their lighting, was inspired by a Judas Priest concert that Murphy attended with Bauhaus' manager.", "Given their mixture of reggae and punk rock, Murphy said that musically, they were \"more aligned to the Clash than anything else that was going around.\" When asked about the influence of reggae on Bauhaus' music, Murphy stated that it was \"massive. We were listening to toasting music all the time, and David brought in a lot of bass lines that were very lead riffs [...] those bass lines really formed the basis of the music\"\" In particular, dub reggae was highly influential to the band, so far that David J mentioned that their signature song, \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", was intended as dub. ", "In terms of early influences from childhood, David J said that he was interested in jazz and its musicians such as Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk. Peter Murphy cited Doris Day, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, The Everly Brothers and his experiences from Mass in Catholic school as highly influential to his singing. When Daniel Ash was asked about how he developed his playing style and guitar influences, he replied: \"My style of playing comes from a mixture of extreme laziness to learn proper scales/chords and a burning desire to sound original and new. Although I am a huge fan of Hendrix and Mick Ronson, Robert Fripp on Bowie tracks is also fab, and what about Earl Slick!\"", "Bauhaus combined these influences to create a gloomy, earnest and introspective version of post-punk, which appealed to many music fans who felt disillusioned in the wake of punk's collapse. Its crucial elements included Murphy's deep and sonorous voice, Ash's jagged guitar playing and David J's dub-influenced bass. Their sound and gloomy style would eventually come to be known as gothic rock or simply \"goth\".", "\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\", was covered by numerous acts, including Until December (1986), the Electric Hellfire Club (1996), Opera IX (on 2000 album The Black Opera: Symphoni\u00e6 Mysteriorum in Laudem Tenebrarum), Sepultura (on 2001 album Nation), Nouvelle Vague (on 2006 album Bande \u00e0 part), Chris Cornell (2007), Nine Inch Nails (2009), Trent Reznor with Murphy and TV on the Radio (2013), Massive Attack (2013), David J with Jill Tracy (2013), Chvrches (for the 2014 Vampire Academy soundtrack), Dead Cross (on their 2017 debut album) and The Damned (2019).", "Susie Lewis, the co-creator of the American animated series Daria, is a fan of the band and used their song \"1.\u00a0David Jay 2.\u00a0Peter Murphy 3.\u00a0Kevin Haskins 4.\u00a0Daniel Ash\" in the closing credits of episode 213, \"Write Where it Hurts\".", "* David J \u2013 bass, keyboards, percussion, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Tones on Tail", "response": ["The band disbanded in late 1984, and Ash and Haskins quickly formed Love and Rockets with former Bauhaus bassist David J."]}, {"page": "Dub music", "response": ["The British post-punk band Bauhaus were highly influenced by dub music, so far that Bauhaus' bass player, David J mentioned that their signature song, Bela Lugosi's Dead, \"was our interpretation of dub\".Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: "]}, {"page": "100 Club Punk Special", "response": ["Attendance at the event later become a badge of honour for punk rock fans, but it is probable that a lot of claims were apocryphal.

Ash's guitar work on the album has been compared to Robert Fripp and Phil Manzanera, though critic Fay Wolftree felt the shaping of his guitar sound \"owes more to Brian Eno and his bank of analogue synths than any player of stringed instruments.\" David J's bass playing largely leans towards dub, while also running with Haskins' drumming \"to maintain an insistent sense of threat or promise.\" Natacha Atlas, who had worked with earlier in the 1990s, also contributes additional vocals and percussion to the album, which Wolftree feel largely contribute to the album's \"world and ethnic feel,\" feeling Atlas' sporadic singing and warm percussion contrast well with Ash's voice.", "\"This Heaven\" flirts with an alternative house style reminiscent of Stereo MC's with its usage of a distorted rap and arousing samples, while its thrust beat and \"breathy female panting and cooing\" led Wolftree to describe it as \"the nineties answer to Donna Summer's awesome dancefloor hit 'I Feel Love', as the more enlightened club DJs in London have already realised.\" She described the song's style as \"sex trance dub or hardbeat world trance.\" \"No Worries\" features sitar sounds, while \"Voodoo Baby\" features tingling keys and a brooding bassline. \"Be the Revolution\" features wiry and wry vocals from David J and a guitar loop from Louis Metoyer. The title track, which appears halfway through the album, is the first track where Ash uses his signature fuzz bass guitar.
