France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lun\u00e9ville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40\u00a0million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, \"The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought\".Schom 1997, p. 414 Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a \"personal Napoleonic one\". Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, \"he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen\".Cronin 1994, p. 344", "Critics argue Napoleon's true legacy must reflect the loss of status for France and needless deaths brought by his rule: historian Victor Davis Hanson writes, \"After all, the military record is unquestioned\u201417 years of wars, perhaps six million Europeans dead, France bankrupt, her overseas colonies lost.\"Hanson 2003 McLynn states that, \"He can be viewed as the man who set back European economic life for a generation by the dislocating impact of his wars.\" Vincent Cronin replies that such criticism relies on the flawed premise that Napoleon was responsible for the wars which bear his name, when in fact France was the victim of a series of coalitions that aimed to destroy the ideals of the Revolution.Cronin 1994, pp. 342\u201343"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Vincent Cronin (1924\u20132011), European and art history"]}, {"page": "Phimosis", "response": ["According to some accounts, phimosis prevented Louis XVI of France from impregnating his wife for the first seven years of their marriage.

This appears to have been used by the Catholic Church to separate Confucian traditions, which were reported to worship spirits and therefore incompatible with the exclusive biblical worship of God. Ironically, although versions of popular Confucianism became strongly associated with idol worship, traditionalists, notably the Kangxi Emperor, did not believe that such idolization accurately reflected Confucius's intent; Matteo Ricci also considered Confucius to be a philosopher rather than the founder of a religion.Vincent Cronin (1955/2015), The Wise Man from the West, San Francisco:  Ignatius, passim."]}, {"page": "Gil Blas", "response": ["According to Vincent Cronin's biography, the first thing that the 15-year-old Napoleon did on arriving in Paris was to buy a copy of Gil Blas."]}, {"page": "List of Harvard University non-graduate alumni", "response": ["|Vincent Cronin || 1924\u20132011 || historian, writer|| Attended College"]}]}}
