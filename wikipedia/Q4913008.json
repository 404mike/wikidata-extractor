However, the team's cup run did not reflect their league form, as they finished ninth in the Second Division, and thus were relegated to the Third Division for season 2003\u201304. The team's fortunes improved from there as, under Neil Watt, they won the Third Division at the first attempt, gaining promotion back to the Second Division. In season 2004\u201305, the team stayed in the top two for most of the campaign. A 1\u20131 draw with closest promotion rivals Morton on 30 April 2005 saw them gain promotion to the First Division for the third time, although they were relegated to the Second Division the following season after finishing ninth and losing out in the play-offs to Partick Thistle."]}, {"page": "Albion Rovers F.C.", "response": ["*Billy McLaren (1992\u20131993)", "*Billy McLaren (1998\u20131999)"]}, {"page": "McLaren (surname)", "response": ["*Billy McLaren (born 1948), Scottish football player"]}]}}
