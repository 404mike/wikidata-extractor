Chaplin supported the girl financially until her 21st birthday. ", "Barry, 21 years old, began an affair with established director Charlie Chaplin, aged 52 years, in the summer of 1941; Chaplin had his studio sign Barry at $75 a week ($ today) with possibility of extension, and came to consider her for the starring role in Shadow and Substance, a film proposed for 1942. Barry's initial contract was not associated with Shadows, but won Chaplin's favour for the part following an \"excellent private reading.\" Indeed, Chaplin spoke highly of her acting abilities, as David Robinson captures in his biography, where he notes \"Chaplin's sincerity in believing that he could make Joan Barry into an actress\u2026. [as] she had \u2018all the qualities of a new Maude Adams' and told his sons, \u2018She has a quality, an ethereal something that's truly marvelous\u2026a talent as great as any I've seen in my whole life.\u201d  Other sources, including FBI case records and Chaplin autobiographical writings, indicate the young actress to have had both talent at her craft, emotional swings, and periods of erratic behavior. According to Chaplin and some Chaplin biographers the relationship ended with Barry's harassing him and displaying signs of the mental illness which would, in later life lead to her commitment. Barry was accused of stalking Chaplin, and had even broke into his home on several occasions. Other sources suggest that after a concerted effort by Chaplin and his studio to prepare Barry for the lead in Shadows, including orthodontic work and participation at the  Max Reinhardt Workshop for acting, Chaplin lost his patience in Barry as an actress after she repeatedly missed classes and developed a drinking problem.", "FBI case files and other records would record two terminated pregnancies during the affair, initially slated to have occurred in New York City, but both eventually being performed by the same L.A. physician. After having a live-born child, a girl, Carol Ann, on October 2, 1943, Barry's mother, who had custody of the child, filed a paternity suit against Chaplin. The suit proceeded to trial, and despite blood tests which showed Chaplin was not the father, Barry's attorney, Joseph Scott, succeeded in arguing that the tests were inadmissible.Maland, Charles J. (1989). Chaplin and American Culture. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. ISBN 978-0-691-02860-6. pp. 205-206. Carol Ann's blood group was B, Barry's was A, and Chaplin's was O. In California at this time, blood tests were not accepted as evidence in legal trials. Chaplin was ordered to support the child until her 21st birthday. Chaplin's second wife, Lita Grey, who was divorced from Chaplin in a bitter, highly public legal proceeding in 1927, would later assert that Chaplin had paid government officials to tamper with the blood test results, further stating that \"there is no doubt that she [Carol Ann] was his child\", although she could not possibly have known 'without a doubt' that Barry did not have sex with other men.In the Matthew Mandarano piece, ca. 2009, cited in the foregoing, Mondarano states: \"Barry was put under contract to Chaplin Studios on June 23, 1941, for the sum of $75 a week, renewable for an extension within six months at $100 a week. Chaplin and his long-time studio manager, Alf Reeves, both insisted that Barry not make it public that she was under contract to Chaplin Studios. / Barry and Chaplin consummated their relationship sometime after her signing the contract and their relationship, though not a public one, was blossoming. Chaplin helped Barry get an apartment, as she was staying at the Ambassador Hotel at the time, and he paid the first two months rent. / Though Chaplin and Barry's relationship grew during the summer of 1941, Chaplin relayed in his My Autobiography that, \u201c\u2026something [was] queer and not quite normal [about his and Barry's time together.] Without telephoning she would suddenly show up late at night at my house. This was somewhat disturbing. Then for a week I would not hear from her\u2026however, when she did show up she was disarmingly pleasant, so my doubts and apprehension were allayed\u201d ([p.] 414). / Barry was indeed a complicated personality. By this time, not only had she gone under nearly a half dozen aliases, but in the FBI records on Chaplin, which number almost 2,000 typed pages, mostly declassified to the public in the early 1980s, Barry was described in many accounts as aloof and somewhat strange acting. Chaplin's studio manager, Alf Reeves, expressed that he noticed Barry was \u201cerratic, emotional, hard to talk to, and could easily effect a vacant stare in her eyes\u201d (Chaplin FBI File 1237). The stenographer for the FBI relates several times of the unbalance in Barry's behavior, once stating, \u201cIt is to be noted that she [Barry] is a girl who becomes very emotional upon occasion\u201d (Chaplin FBI File 1442). / It seems at times, however, that Barry could also be quite pleasant, as she was generally liked by Chaplin's butler, Edward Chaney, and well regarded by Stephen Seck, Barry's son from a subsequent marriage, who remembers his mother as \u201cvery gifted, a talented singer who worked hard to support us (he and his brother, Russell, and half-sister, Carol Ann). We were never neglected in any way\u201d (Seck Interview). / During the fall of 1941, Barry was planning a trip home to New York and came under suspicion that she might be pregnant. Yet, she was perplexed by this in that Chaplin had told her that he was unable to have children, though he had two adolescent sons from his marriage to his second wife Lita Grey Chaplin (1908\u20131995), Charlie Jr. (1925\u20131968) and Sydney (1926\u20132009). When Barry told Chaplin of the pregnancy, he told her he would pay for her to have an operation in New York, though Barry later ending up having the abortion under the supervision of a Los Angeles doctor, a Dr. A. M. Tweedie. / After the first abortion, Barry was fitted with a diaphragm. Chaplin, however, did not want to use it during intercourse. By December, 1941, Barry felt she might be pregnant again. Chaplin, who took the news as a joke, insisted she get another abortion. Barry reluctantly agreed and had a second abortion under the supervision of Dr. Tweedie. Upon completion, she spent four to five days recuperating at Chaplin's home on Summit Drive in Beverly Hills. This second abortion took a much higher toll on Barry's health and longer for her to recover, though she did mention to the FBI that Chaplin was quite good to her and did what he could to help during her stay at his home. / On the business end, Chaplin had not done a film project at this point since The Great Dictator (1940), and was working primarily on a soundtrack for The Gold Rush (1925). The idea for his next film came during a luncheon with Sir Cedric Hardwicke and author Sinclair Lewis, who, during conversation mentioned the play Shadow and Substance by Paul Vincent Carroll. Lewis referred to the character of Bridget, the lead role in the play, as a modern day Joan of Arc. Chaplin was intrigued and requested a copy of the play to read. / In talking about the play over dinner one night, Barry mentioned she would like to play the role of Bridget. Chaplin didn't take her very seriously at first, but after she performed an excellent private reading, he gave her a screen test. Her screen test took place on Jan. 26, 1942, and it was deemed that she was photogenic and could work for the part. In his autobiography, Chaplin states that at this time \u201c\u2026all my qualms about her oddities vanished\u201d ([p.] 414). / Over the next few months, Barry was in strong preparation for her starring role in Shadow and Substance, for which Chaplin had by now purchased the film rights. Chaplin Studios paid for Barry to get dental and orthodontic work done, were paying for her to attend the Max Reinhardt Workshop for acting and Barry was bought a fur coat for $1,200 at the May Company as a special gift. / In a passage from David Robinson's definitive biography on Chaplin, Chaplin: His Life and Art, \u201cThere is no question about Chaplin's sincerity in believing that he could make Joan Barry into an actress\u2026.he [Chaplin] said she had \u2018all the qualities of a new Maude Adams' and told his sons, \u2018She has a quality, an ethereal something that's truly marvelous\u2026a talent as great as any I've seen in my whole life\u201d ([p.] 512).", "Barry married Russell Seck, a railway clerk, in 1946.
