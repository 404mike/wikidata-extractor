As a member of the Conservative Party and later an independent, he served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dover from 2010 to 2019.\nElphicke read law at the University of Nottingham before working as a solicitor. He was first elected as Conservative MP for Dover at the 2010 general election and served as a government whip and Lord Commissioner of the Treasury from 2015 to 2016. He did not stand for re-election at the 2019 general election and was succeeded by his wife, Natalie Elphicke.\nElphicke was suspended from the Conservatives in November 2017 after he was accused of sexual offences against two members of his staff but had the Conservative whip reinstated prior to a December 2018 confidence vote in Theresa May. In July 2019, the whip was withdrawn again after he was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service with three counts of sexual assault against two women. In July 2020, he was found guilty of all three counts, sentenced to two years' imprisonment, and ordered to pay \u00a335,000 within a year towards the costs of the prosecution.
