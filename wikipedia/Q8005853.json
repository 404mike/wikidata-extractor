He is notable as the first man to perform the \"wicket-keeper's hat-trick\" (three dismissals off consecutive deliveries) and the only man to perform a hat-trick of stumpings.Born in Clifton, Bristol, Brain was a member of the Clifton College XI, captaining it in 1889. He went up to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1889 and made his first-class debut for Oxford University in 1891 against Lancashire, in the same year hitting his only half-century by making 65 not out (with no teammate scoring more than 13) in his only appearance for MCC, against Somerset. Playing for Gloucestershire in 1893, Brain made three stumpings from successive balls bowled by Charlie Townsend, removing Arthur Newton, George Nichols and Ted Tyler to finish off the Somerset second innings.He played no more first-class games after that season, instead becoming involved with Glamorgan and playing a number of minor matches for that county between 1894 and 1907, including two games in the Minor Counties Championship. The second of these against Lancashire Second XI, was his last significant match; he did not keep wicket, this role being taken by his older brother Joseph. The two Brains opened the batting together in the second innings, but William was run out for a duck.\nLater, Brain was instrumental in helping Glamorgan's drive for first-class status, which they eventually achieved in 1921. He died at the age of 64 in Dinas Powys, Glamorgan, Wales.\nAs well as the aforementioned brother Joseph, two of Brain's sons played first-class cricket. Pat made a handful of appearances for Glamorgan in the 1920s, while Michael had a single first-class outing for the same county, in 1930.\nBrain was the owner of Vaendre Hall in the village of St Mellons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clifton College", "response": ["* William Brain, English cricketer and footballer"]}, {"page": "Charlie Townsend", "response": ["Townsend first emerged as a leg break bowler from Clifton College at the age of 16 in 1893.\"Clifton College Register\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p175: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 He took 21 wickets in four games and showed, despite his very slight build, the ability to get through a lot of bowling and spin the ball prodigiously from leg. In one innings against Middlesex, he bowled 70 five-ball overs (equivalent to 58 six-ball overs).  In that season, his county's wicket-keeper, William Brain, completed the only instance in first-class cricket of a hat-trick of stumpings, taken off Townsend's bowling. The following year, Townsend's record was modest though Grace gave him a good deal of bowling on soft pitches, and he was seen as not physically strong enough for county cricket by most critics of the day.Pardon, Sydney H.

He continued his education at Trinity College, Oxford.Bolton (1962), p. 367. At Oxford he played in a strong side captained by Lionel Palairet and including C. B. Fry. He earned his Blue\u2014the awarding of the Oxford \"colours\" to sportsmen\u2014in each of 1892 and 1893 when he played in the University match against Cambridge, and in the latter year caused some discussion when batting. Oxford required five runs to avoid the follow-on, and Wilson was at the crease with William Brain, the last two men for their side. Wisden relates that: \"The two batsmen consulted together between the wickets and it was evident that the Dark Blues were going to throw away a wicket in order that their side might go in again. C. M. Wells frustrated this intention by bowling two wide balls to the boundary.\" Partially as a result of this, the follow on rule was adjusted for the subsequent season. In all, Wilson played 17 first-class matches, all for Oxford, and took 46 wickets at an average of 22.02. While at Oxford, he also played rugby union, representing his college. In 1898, he was chosen in a cricket team to represent Rockhampton in a match against Brisbane."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* William Brain (1893) : W.
