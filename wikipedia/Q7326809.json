Beyond their main roles in the band, all three were multi-instrumentalists and often swapped around instruments both in the studio and onstage. With Sion Lane (keyboards) and Steffan Cravos (violin) added to the lineup, Gorky's recorded the self-released cassette Allumette (1991).  Sion and Steffan left shortly afterwards (the latter going on to form Welsh language rap group Tystion) and drummer Osian Evans was recruited for second cassette Peiriant Pleser (1992).
