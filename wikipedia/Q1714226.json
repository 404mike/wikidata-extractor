In 1846, the British Foreign Office sent Justin Sheil to Persia to negotiate with the Shah on the slave trade. At first the Shah refused to limit either slavery or the slave trade on the grounds that the Quran did not forbid it and he could not forbid something that the Quran deemed legal. Further the Shah asserted that banning the slave trade would reduce converts to Islam. However, in 1848, Mohammad Shah made a small concession and issued a farman banning the maritime trade of slaves.J.B.

Accounts differ on the details, but all agree that the first volley failed to kill the B\u00e1b; the bullets had instead cut the rope suspending them from the wall.Some accounts say An\u00eds succumbed to death on the first volley, another that the B\u00e1b was dispatched by a sword.

All accounts, even the Muslim ones, concur that the B\u00e1b survived the first volley. A second firing squad was brought in and a second order to fire given. This time the B\u00e1b was killed. In B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed tradition, the failure of the first firing to kill the B\u00e1b is believed a miracle.
