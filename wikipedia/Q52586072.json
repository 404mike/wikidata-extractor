Her 1936 oil painting \"Royal Albion,\" at the Auckland Art Gallery (NZ), is noted for the \"artist's use of simplified blocks of form and colour.\" She grew up in Frinton-on-Sea and studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art in London.  Between 1935 and 1939, she exhibited her oil-paintings and wood-engravings at the Redfern Gallery, the Zwemmer Gallery, the Wertheim Gallery and the Stafford Gallery, and with the National Society of Painters, Sculptors & Print-Makers and the Society of Women Artists.  The influential collector Lucy Wertheim, in addition to exhibiting her work, bought two of Cooper's oil paintings.", "link_mentions": {}}}
