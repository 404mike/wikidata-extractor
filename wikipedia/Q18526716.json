Wightman and whilst supporting his work at St. Alkmund\u2019s church in Shrewsbury, she would encourage people to \"sign the pledge\". This was a temperance device where people would sign to say that they would give up alcohol completely. She could not understand the need for this as she would have preferred people to be moderate, but she could see that many could not resist. Wightman wanted them to be good Christians and she saw that sobriety was a secondary but essential prerequisite for some men. She discussed these ideas in letters she exchanged with the writer Catherine Marsh and her sister. She could see how soldiers billeted in Shrewsbury would quickly exchange their pay for alcohol and the army only encouraged it by billeting new soldiers in taverns. Wives would meet their husbands on pay day to intercept the wages into the family purse before their men went to the pub."]}]}}
