He is often referred to as the first researcher to bring anthropology \"off the verandah\" (a phrase that is also the name of a Andr\u00e9 Singer's 1986 documentary about his work), that is, stressing the need for fieldwork enabling the researcher to experience the everyday life of his subjects along with them. Malinowski emphasised the importance of detailed participant observation and argued that anthropologists must have daily contact with their informants if they are to adequately record the \"imponderabilia of everyday life\" that are so important to understanding a different culture. He stated that the goal of the anthropologist, or ethnographer, is \"to grasp the native's point of view, his relation to life, to realize his vision of his world\".Argonauts of the Western Pacific, Dutton 1961 edition, p.\u00a025.

He also learned the language of the natives. His argument was shaped by his initial experiences as an anthropologist in the mid-1910s in Australia and Oceania, where during his first field trip he found himself grossly unprepared for it, due to not knowing the language of the people he set to study, nor being able to observe their daily customs sufficiently (during that initial trip, he was lodged with a local missionary and just made daily trips to the village, an endeavour which became increasingly difficult once he lost his translator). His pioneering decision to subsequently immerse himself in the life of the natives represents his solution to this problem, and was the message he addressed to new, young anthropologists, aiming to both improve their experience and allow them to produce better data. Because of the impact of his argument, Malinowski is sometimes credited with inventing the field of ethnography.
