His weakest subjects are horse racing and soap operas. He noted that the American version posed far more difficulties for him, as American game shows typically allow far more competent contestants than British or Australian shows; he stated that his most challenging opponent was James Holzhauer, co-winner of the first American version of The Chase and later a famous Jeopardy! contestant and participant in that show's \"Greatest of All Time\" tournament.

Olav Bjortomt: Olav Bjortomt was beaten by Shaun Wallace in a surprise defeat. Olav won 4 head-to-heads to Shaun's 1. However, he slipped up in the final round when not taking Chris's advice on the question 'On which river are the sailing vessels Nuggers used?' Olav incorrectly chose the Indus, whereas the answer was the Nile. This allowed Shaun to complete a 5\u20134 victory when he answered his fifth question correctly.", "Match Four: Shaun Wallace v.

Shaun Wallace: In the final, Barry Simmons came back against all the odds to claim his place as the sixth Egghead.

It was the fourth head-to-head before Shaun even got an answer wrong, Barry finally winning at Science. Shaun eventually took a 4\u20131 lead into the final round as he completed the head-to-heads with a win on Sport. With 10 points needed to win the contest, an extraordinary turnaround saw Barry fight back from his deficit to win the match. Shaun went from having answered only one question wrongly in the head-to-heads to getting his first eight in the final wrong. Barry, on the other hand, stormed ahead to lead 8\u20134 before Shaun finally answered a question correctly, coming back to 9\u20136.
