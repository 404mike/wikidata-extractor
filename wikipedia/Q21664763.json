She continued her studies at St Mary's College, Durham and went on to Oxford University, where she earned a PhD in 1968 with A. O. L. Atkin as her advisor. Also, in 1968, she married Lieutenant A.H. Millington. She was awarded a two-year Science Research Council Fellowship which allowed her to pursue research at any university. During her husband's two-year posting in Germany, she taught mathematics at an Army Education Centre there.She died in Germany due to a brain tumour at the age of 29.Although her career was cut short, in 1983, the London Mathematical Society organized a symposium on modular forms. During the symposium, the importance of her doctoral thesis and post-doctoral research became clear. The work that she had started during her fellowship was picked up and pursued by other mathematicians, leading to a resurgence in the field.In a tribute to Millington, Atkin said \"I have no doubt that, had she lived, she would have made exciting original contributions to a field which has at last come into its own again, after nearly a quarter century in the doldrums, and where there are now at least twenty first rate people of her generation working actively.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of women in mathematics", "response": ["* Margaret Millington (1944\u20131973), English expert on modular forms"]}, {"page": "Millington (surname)", "response": ["*Margaret Millington (1944\u20131973), English-born mathematician"]}, {"page": "List of female scientists in the 20th century", "response": ["*Margaret Millington (1944\u20131973), English mathematician"]}]}}
