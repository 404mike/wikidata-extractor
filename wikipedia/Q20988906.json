He was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham and died in Hackney, London.\nDavies had a 50-years-long career as a club cricketer for Alexandra Park Cricket Club in North London and was reckoned in his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack to have made 64,000 runs, including 126 centuries, as a right-handed middle-order batsman and to have taken more than 5,000 wickets with left-arm orthodox spin. He became president of the Club Cricket Conference, the organisation for amateur cricket clubs.\nHis first-class career was limited and was for the county of his birth, Warwickshire, with eight matches in four different seasons dotted across seven years. He took a few wickets in each of his first-class games, though never more than three in any single one; his batting flourished only once, when he made 63 and shared a fifth-wicket partnership of 168 with Reg Santall in the game against Kent in 1933.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Conrad Davies (1930\u20131936) : C.
