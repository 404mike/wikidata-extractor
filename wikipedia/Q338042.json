He had a notable collaboration with director Peter Yates that extended over six films including The Dresser (1983), which was nominated for numerous BAFTA Awards and Academy Awards.\nLovejoy was an assistant to editor Anne V. Coates for films from The Horse's Mouth (1958) to Lawrence of Arabia (1962). He was next an assistant to editor Anthony Harvey on Dr. Strangelove (1964), which was produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. Harvey subsequently became a director himself, and Kubrick promoted Lovejoy to be the editor for his subsequent film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Kubrick and Lovejoy next worked together on The Shining (1980); Kubrick worked with other editors for his two films from the 1970s.\nStephen Prince described Lovejoy's contributions to 1980s films as follows, \"Ray Lovejoy cut Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and he worked again with Kubrick on The Shining and supplied that film with an entirely different--tenser, more foreboding--texture than the stately science-fiction film possesses. Lovejoy also proved adept at editing for blockbuster effect. His cutting in Aliens sustained that sequel's narrative momentum with a speed and tension that its predecessor did not have, and his editing on Batman finessed that film's gaping narrative problems by simply rushing past them.\"In 1987, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing for his work on the film Aliens (1986). In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild published a list of the 75 best-edited films of all time based on a survey of its members. Two films edited by Lovejoy are on this listing. 2001: A Space Odyssey was listed nineteenth, and The Shining was listed as forty-fourth.Lovejoy died of a heart attack on 18 October 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Film Editing", "response": ["| Ray Lovejoy"]}, {"page": "2001 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19 || Ray Lovejoy || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 62 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Film Editor || "]}, {"page": "Aliens (film)", "response": ["Post-production began in late April 1986, and Ray Lovejoy edited the film. Several scenes were removed from Aliens theatrical release, including Ripley learning about her daughter's death and a cocooned Burke begging her for death. Fox and Hurd suggested removing a long opening scene detailing the lives of the colonists, Newt's family discovering the derelict alien ship, and her father being attacked by a facehugger, because it ruined the film's pacing and sense of mystery. Two scenes with James Remar as Hicks (shown from the back) were used in the film.", "Aliens received two awards at the 1987 Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing (Don Sharpe) and Best Visual Effects (Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson, Suzanne Benson). Weaver was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Marlee Matlin for the romantic drama Children of a Lesser God. Weaver's was the first Best Actress nomination for a science-fiction film, when the genre was given little respect. The film received four other nominations: Best Original Score for Horner (losing to Herbie Hancock for the musical drama Round Midnight); Best Art Director for Peter Lamont and Crispian Sallis (losing to Gianni Quaranta, Brian Ackland-Snow, Brian Savegar and Elio Altamura for the romance, A Room with a View); Best Editing for Ray Lovejoy (losing to Claire Simpson for Platoon), and Best Sound for Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier, Michael A. Carter, and Roy Charman (losing to John K. Wilkinson, Richard Rogers, Charles Grenzbach and Simon Kaye for Platoon). Weaver's nomination remains a rarity in the action or science-fiction genres. At the 44th Golden Globe Awards, she was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama (again losing to Matlin for Children of a Lesser God)."]}, {"page": "Batman (franchise)", "response": ["| Ray Lovejoy"]}, {"page": "59th Academy Awards", "response": ["** Aliens\u00a0\u2013 Ray Lovejoy"]}, {"page": "Alien (franchise)", "response": ["| Ray Lovejoy"]}, {"page": "Batman in film", "response": ["| Ray Lovejoy"]}, {"page": "List of film director and editor collaborations", "response": ["* Stanley Kubrick: Ray Lovejoy (1968\u20131980), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).", "* Peter Yates: Ray Lovejoy (1983\u20131992), The Dresser (1983)."]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["|Ray Lovejoy"]}, {"page": "List of accolades received by the Alien film series", "response": ["| Ray Lovejoy"]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2001", "response": ["*Ray Lovejoy, 62, British film editor, heart attack."]}, {"page": "The Shining (franchise)", "response": ["|Ray Lovejoy"]}]}}
