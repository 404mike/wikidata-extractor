In 1940 and 1941 he helped many British soldiers escape France after its surrender to Nazi Germany in World War II. He became a double agent for the Germans in December 1941 (or possibly earlier) and betrayed to the Gestapo 150 escape line workers and members of the French Resistance, of whom about 50 were executed or died in German concentration camps.Cole has been described as \"the worst traitor of the war.\" He deceived both the British and the Germans and escaped from prison on several occasions.

Gu\u00e9risse told nothing to the Gestapo interrogators when he was tortured and then was sent to a series of concentration camps, including Mauthausen.

On 16 September 1943, at least 37 of the prisoners escaped.  Charlet and the other prisoners had obtained pistols and keys to the cells and the guards were locked up or deceived.

Warenghem had a child  by Harold Cole a notorious turncoat who caused the imprisonment of many SOE agents. The child died a few months after being born. Charlet and Warenghem reached open country and, helped by a local farmer, took refuge in a Benedictine monastery.
