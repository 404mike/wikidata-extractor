He had not joined the Oxford Union as budding politicians usually did. However, as heir to the family estates he was doubtful about the prospect of life as a country gentleman: \"I was always rather discontented with this role and felt it wasn't going to be enough.\" His biographer David Dutton believes that Dunglass became interested in politics because of the widespread unemployment and poverty in the Scottish lowlands where his family lived. Later in his career, when he had become prime minister, Dunglass (by then Sir Alec Douglas-Home) wrote in a memorandum: \"I went into politics because I felt that it was a form of public service and that as nearly a generation of politicians had been cut down in the first war those who had anything to give in the way of leadership ought to do so.\" His political thinking was influenced by that of Noel Skelton, a member of the Unionist party (as the Conservatives were called in Scotland between 1912 and 1965). Skelton advocated \"a property-owning democracy\", based on share-options for workers and industrial democracy. Dunglass was not persuaded by the socialist ideal of public ownership. He shared Skelton's view that \"what everybody owns nobody owns\"."]}, {"page": "National Government (1935\u20131937)", "response": ["| Noel Skelton"]}, {"page": "Combined Scottish Universities (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Noel Skelton\t"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Noel Skelton"]}, {"page": "Skelton", "response": ["*Noel Skelton (1880\u20131935), Scottish British MP"]}, {"page": "Perth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Noel Skelton", "|  Noel Skelton"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Noel Skelton"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland", "response": ["|Noel Skelton"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Noel Skelton"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|13 April 1945The Combined Scottish Universities was a three-member constituency which experienced three by-elections in this Parliament, each won by a different party from both the others and the general election.
