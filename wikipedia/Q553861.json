Since the beginning of the 1990s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz).Nicholson, Stuart (January 3, 2003), \"Jazztronica: A Brief History of the Future of Jazz\", JazzTimes.

Autechre would continue to be licensed by Nothing Records until 2000, with Nothing working in tandem with Warp to release nearly all of the duo's new material in the US during this period.  In 1999, Nothing released Autechre's Peel Session (a live recording from John Peel's legendary radio show - a second session of which was released by Warp in 2000) and EP7.  The Warp CD edition of EP7 included a hidden track 00, which could be heard by starting track one of the CD, then rewinding backwards.

Squarepusher is Tom Jenkinson of Chelmsford, Essex, England.  After learning bass guitar and playing in local bands in his youth, Tom began taking an interest in techno and house music in the early 1990s.  Amongst his influences were Aphex Twin and future Nothing Records label-mate Luke Vibert, particularly with his work as Plug.  Jenkinson said of Plug's track \"Military Jazz,\" \"This track came on and, amongst the road noise and chatter, I heard what I thought was some sort of hip-hop track being played by a band.  As the track progressed, I became more intrigued, as it sounded like they were trying to play as if it had been programmed.  Then the Amen [break] came in, and I was floored; it sounded like a drummer playing breakbeats, and made me totally rethink my ideas of programming breaks.\"", "Jenkinson went on to record a few more releases under his own name, including the Crot E.P. and Bubble And Squeak E.P., as well as a split with Dunderhead, called Dragon Disc 2.  In 1995, Tom began releasing music under the name Squarepusher, first appearing with the Conumber E:P, then following with Alroy Road Tracks under the name Duke Of Harringay, both on Finn's Spymania label.  By 1996, Squarepusher had line up material for release at Rephlex Records, which was operated by Grant Wilson-Claridge and Richard D. James, a.k.a. Aphex Twin.  Squarepusher released the Squarepusher Plays... 12\" for Rephlex, followed by his debut album, Feed Me Weird Things (Jenkinson later released an album and E.P. under the name Chaos A.D. for Rephlex in 1998).", "Shortly after the release of Feed Me Weird Things, Squarepusher released his first music for Warp Records in the form of the Port Rhombus EP in 1996.  Jenkinson signed a multi-album deal with Warp and the label would become his long-time and primary home.  The Vic Acid EP was released in 1997, followed by his sophomore full-length, Hard Normal Daddy.  Later that year, Warp and Sypmania would co-release Burningn'n Tree, which compiled the Conumber E:P and Alroy Road Tracks, alongsing three previously unreleased tracks.", "Also in 1997, the Big Loada EP was released on Warp.  By 1998, the Nothing deal had come into place and Squarepusher would receive his first licensing into the United States, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced his music to Trent Reznor.  Nothing decided to revisit the Big Loada EP and expand it into album length, adding on all tracks from the Port Rhombus EP and two tracks (\"Lone Ravers (Live In Chelmsford Mix)\" and \"The Barn (303 Kebab Mix)\") from Vic Acid.  The song \"Come On My Selector\" was also moved up to open the album, with a music video for the track directed by Chris Cunningham, which was included as a file on the Nothing edition, as an enhanced CD.  Two tracks from Big Loada, \"Tequila Fish\" and \"Massif (Stay Strong),\" also featured on the Nothing Records compilation Nothing Changes, which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine.", "Nothing did not pick up Hard Normal Daddy for release, but did pick up most of Squarepusher's output through the remainder of the 1990s.  Music Is Rotted One Note was released on October 13, 1998, the same day as Nothing version of Big Loada.  The mini album Budakhan Mindphone followed on March 1, 1999.  The Maximum Priest E.P. was released July 19, 1999, which featured remixes from Nothing Records label-mates Autechre and Luke Vibert (under the name Wagon Christ).  The final Squarepusher album to see release on Nothing Records was Selection Sixteen on November 8, 1999.  Aside from Big Loada, all of the Squarepusher releases on Nothing Records were essentially identical to the Warp editions.", "Squarepusher's tenure at Nothing Records concluded when Warp Records established their own US distribution, though a deal with Caroline Distribution (which later expired), effectively ending all of Warp's licensing to Nothing.  Squarepusher's licensing through Nothing Records served Jenkinson well in helping to establish his US following.  By the time he began receiving direct US release via Warp, Squarepusher had become known as one of the most innovative acts in electronic music.  All five of his Nothing Records releases were eventually reissued in the US under the Warp umbrella after the Nothing deal ended, though the album-length version of Big Loada remains unique to Nothing Records, with Warp opting to keep the releases in their original, EP formats.  Squarepusher continues to push new boundaries to this day, where he still calls Warp Records his home, having released numerous albums to critical acclaim in the years to follow, such as Go Plastic, Do You Know Squarepusher, Ultravisitor, Hello Everything, Just A Souvenir, Solo Electric Bass 1, Ufabulum and Damogen Furies.  Also in recent years, Jenkinson has launched a live band, Shobaleader One, which releases both original material and reinterpered versions of Squarepusher classics.  They have released two albums to date; d'Demonstrator and Elektrac.", "Plaid, alongside label-mates Autechre and Squarepusher, was part of a trio of Warp acts picked up for licensing in the United States after their label struck a deal with Nothing Records.  Plaid is the British duo of Ed Handley and Andy Turner.  Both began as founding members of the electronic group The Black Dog, alongside Ken Downie.  Handley and Turner would appear on numerous albums with The Black Dog during the early 1990s, which received critical acclaim, including Bytes, Temple of Transparent Balls, Parallel and Spanners.  In 1991, Handley and Turner released Mbuki Mvuki, their debut under the name of Plaid.  The album was self-released on their Black Dog Productions imprint.

It is categorized as an art rock album by The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Edna Gundersen of USA Today, and Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly. Hermes views that, like \"art-rockers\" King Crimson and David Bowie, Reznor incorporates elements of 20th-century classical music on the album, \"mixing prepared piano melodies \u00e0 la John Cage with thematic flavor from Claude Debussy\". Music journalist Ann Powers observes elements of progressive rock bands King Crimson and Roxy Music, Reznor's influences, and the experimentation of electronica artists such as Autechre and Squarepusher, and writes that The Fragile uses funk bass lines, North African minor-key modalities, and the treatment of tonality by Symbolist composers like Debussy.

While Weinman still appreciated heavy metal, he became \"desensitized\" to most of it because \"there weren't new bands or old bands creating new albums that were pushing anything [new]\" and felt it had become \"formulaic\". He and Pennie were also heavily inspired by IDM artists, especially Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and Autechre. What tied all the band members together was their admiration for progressive and jazz fusion artists such as King Crimson, Cynic, Meshuggah and Mahavishnu Orchestra, particularly their albums Discipline, Focus, Destroy Erase Improve and Apocalypse respectively. They credit these artists for their choice of complex time signatures and unconventional beat accenting. The guitarist also cited IDM music for his use of chaotic riffs, stating that, in some ways, they did \"the guitar version of [intelligent dance music], using certain rhythms and frequencies\" that sound \"so random, but the more you listened to it, the more it made sense, and actually had intention.\" They learned how to blend all their initial influences on the Under the Running Board EP, and, for this album, the joining of Fulton had a major impact on Weinman's guitar playing through the incorporation of more technical types of guitar work.
