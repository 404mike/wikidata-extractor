In 1770 Matthias Mawson, former Master and Bishop of Ely, bequeathed \u00a33000 to defray the costs of demolishing and rebuilding the college but this was not enough. It was not until 1822 when \u00a355,000 had accrued in the rebuilding fund that efforts started. William Wilkins, who had recently completed major works at Downing, King's, and Trinity, was appointed architect and the New Court was completed in 1827 in a neo-gothic style. This involved the demolition of several buildings, including the Elizabethan chapel. The chapel currently standing in New Court is part of the 19th-century construction. Completion of a new, larger court allowed for many more students and numbers increased from 48 to 100."]}, {"page": "Ely Cathedral", "response": ["*Matthias Mawson \u2014 Bishop of Ely (1754\u20131771)"]}]}}
