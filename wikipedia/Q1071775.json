He had a fine debut season scoring 17 goals as the \"Shrews\" gained promotion to the Third Division. He continued to perform well and in 1977 he joined Swindon Town where he spent two years before joining Bristol Rovers. After a year at Rovers he re-joined Shrewsbury Town and in 1984 he became player manager.\nHe left in 1987 to become assistant manager to Lou Macari at Swindon Town and followed Macari to Stoke City and Celtic and back to Stoke. After Macari left Stoke in May 1997 Bates was appointed as manager and despite a decent start Stoke's form fell away and with the side destined for relegation he was sacked in January 1998. He returned to Shrewsbury and had two spells as caretaker manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stoke City F.C.", "response": ["1997\u201398 saw Stoke move to its new ground, the Britannia Stadium, after 119 years at the Victoria Ground. Chic Bates, Macari's assistant, was appointed manager for the club's first season in the new ground. He did not last long though, and was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes either, and he too left in April. Alan Durban, previously Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took charge for the remainder of season. Despite his best efforts, Durban was unable to keep the club up, as defeat against Manchester City on the final day of the season consigned Stoke to relegation to the third tier.", "|  Chic Bates"]}, {"page": "Shrewsbury Town F.C.", "response": ["* Chic Bates (1984\u20131987)", "* Chic Bates (1999)", "* Chic Bates (2004)"]}, {"page": "Stourbridge F.C.", "response": ["In 1971 the club was elected to the expanding Southern League and met almost instant success under manager Alan Grundy in the 1973\u201374 season, with the Division 1 (North) title and the Merit Cup (for the league's highest goalscorers) coming to Amblecote.  Twin strikers Ray Haywood and Chic Bates each notched 50 goals that season and were transferred to Shrewsbury Town, where Bates served 13 years as both player and manager.  Another highlight in 1973\u201374 was a tremendous run in the Welsh Cup, in which the team disposed of both Swansea City and Wrexham on their own grounds and then faced Cardiff City in a two leg final.

Supporters were dismayed with the board after Mark Stein was sold to Chelsea in October 1993 for \u00a31.4 million and shortly after Macari left to join Celtic. Macari returned to Stoke the following season and the side nearly gained promotion in 1995\u201396 losing to Leicester City in the play-offs. The board decided to move to a new all-seater-stadium following the 1996\u201397 season after deciding it would be too costly to upgrade the Victoria Ground to meet the Taylor Report. The first season at the new Britannia Stadium was a disaster for the club as unexpectedly Macari left and was replaced by his assistant Chic Bates. Coates was coming in for a lot of criticism from supporters for his lack of spending and after a embarrassing 7\u20130 defeat at home to Birmingham City on 10 January 1998 around 2,000 angry supporters invaded the pitch at full-time and some attempted to enter the directors box. After more fan protests Coates resigned as chairman although he remained a majority shareholder, whilst Keith Humphreys was appointed chairman as Stoke were relegated to the Second Division."]}, {"page": "Peter Thorne (English footballer)", "response": ["Thorne joined Stoke City in July 1997 after manager Chic Bates paid \u00a3500,000 for his services. He was signed as a replacement for Mike Sheron who joined Queens Park Rangers. He top-scored with 16 goals in 1997\u201398 which was unable to prevent Stoke suffering relegation to the Second Division. He struggled for form in 1998\u201399 scoring 11 goals before he became a regular goalscorer in 1999\u20132000. He scored 30 goals as Stoke reached the play-offs where they lost out to Gillingham. During the season Thorne scored four goals against Chesterfield on 4 March 2000 becoming the first Stoke player to score four goals in a single match since John Ritchie in 1966. He also scored the winning goal in the 2000 Football League Trophy Final. Thorne again top-scored in 2000\u201301 with 19 goals as Stoke again failed in the play-offs this time against Walsall. Thorne began the 2001\u201302 season well scoring four goals in five matches before he left to join Graham Kavanagh at Cardiff City. In Total Thorne scored 80 goals for Stoke in 189 appearances."]}]}}
