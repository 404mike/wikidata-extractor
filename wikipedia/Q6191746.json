He inherited estates including Sutton Court from his father at three years of age. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford and was admitted at Middle Temple, London, in 1688. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1719.He introduced a theory of rock formations known as Stratum, based on a pictorial cross-section of the geology under his estate at Bishop Sutton and Stowey in the Chew Valley and coal seams in nearby coal works of the Somerset coalfield, projecting them according to their measured thicknesses and attitudes into unknown areas between the coal workings. The purpose was to enhance the value of his grant of a coal-lease on parts of his estate. This work was later developed by William Smith.In addition to his map making and geological interests he had several other publications including An Alphabetical List of the Religious Houses in Somersetshire (1731).He died in Greenwich, London. He had married twice; firstly Elizabeth Elletson, with whom he had 18 children (see picture of 8 of them) and secondly Christina Staveley, with whom he had a further one child.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Smith (geologist)", "response": ["Smith was born in the village of Churchill, Oxfordshire, the son of John Smith (1735\u20131777), the village blacksmith, and his wife Ann (n\u00e9e Smith; 1745\u20131807). His father died when he was eight years old, and he and his siblings were raised by his uncle, a farmer also named William Smith.Winchester (2001), The Map That Changed the World, p. 27 Largely self-educated, Smith was intelligent and observant, read widely from an early age, and with an aptitude for mathematics and drawing. In 1787, he met and found work as an assistant for Edward Webb of Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, a surveyor. He was quick to learn, and soon became proficient at the trade. In 1791, he travelled to Somerset to make a valuation survey of the Sutton Court estate, and building on earlier work in the same area by John Strachey. He stayed in the area for the next eight years, working first for Webb and later for the Somersetshire Coal Canal Company, living at Rugborne Farm in High Littleton. During this period, Smith inspected a number of coal mines in the area, where he first observed and recorded the various layers of rock and coal exposed by the mining; Smith's coal mine studies, combined with his subsequent observations of the strata exposed by canal excavations, proved crucial to the formation of his theories of stratigraphy."]}, {"page": "Chew Magna", "response": ["* John Strachey (1671\u20131743), geologist"]}, {"page": "Strachey", "response": ["*John Strachey (d. 1674), friend of John Locke", "**John Strachey (geologist) (1671\u20131743), British geologist", "****Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet (1737\u20131810), British politician and civil servant; son of Henry Strachey and grandson of the geologist John Strachey.

In 1815, William Smith published his famous geological map and when Greenough finally published his map five years later it was clear he was heavily indebted to Smith's work in delineating strata (although not acknowledged and thus plagiarized until the 1865 edition); nevertheless Greenough's map contained more geological detail and was better cartographically. Smith had relied on a theory about the linear arrangement of strata identified by characteristic fossils to extrapolate from his observations (Smith himself was indebted to John Strachey's theory of strata for his ideas), and so was able to map out the distribution of strata across the country. Greenough, on the other hand, did not go by theory, and this aversion was probably one of the factors that delayed the preparation of his map."]}, {"page": "Geology of Somerset", "response": ["Coal measures appear in the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks).

This family was originally seated at Walden, Essex, where William Strachey was living under the rule of Edward VI. Later they moved to Surrey and at last settled at Sutton Court, Somerset. The title was created on 15 June 1801 for the politician and civil servant Henry Strachey. Sir Henry was private secretary to Lord Clive during his last expedition to India in 1764. He also took part in negotiations for peace with North America where he assisted the kings commissioners at Paris. He died in 1809 and was succeeded by his eldest son Henry, the second Baronet Strachey. His great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, was a Liberal politician. On 3 November 1911, he was created Baron Strachie, of Sutton Court in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He later served as Paymaster-General. The peerage became extinct on the death of his son, the second Baron, in 1973. The late Baron was succeeded in the baronetcy by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Baronet. He was the son of John Strachey, son and namesake of John Strachey, second son of the third Baronet. Strachey died January 2014 and did not use his title.

Smith worked for the Stracheys who owned Sutton Court, at one of their older mines, the Mearns Pit at High Littleton. As he observed the rock strata at the pit, he realised that they were arranged in a predictable pattern that the various strata could always be found in the same relative positions and each particular stratum could be identified by the fossils it contained and the same succession of fossil groups from older to younger rocks could be found in other parts of England. Smith noticed an easterly dip in the beds of rock\u2014small near the surface (about three degrees) then greater after the Triassic rocks which led to him a testable hypothesis, which he termed the principle of faunal succession, and he began to determine if the relationships between the strata and their characteristics were consistent throughout the country.
