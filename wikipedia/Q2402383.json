He contributed to the success of dozens of musicals.\nBorn in Kensington, London, he attended Winchester College before studying law at University College, Oxford. He began writing songs for shows at the age of 10 and had his first major success with \"The Little Chinchilla\" for the hit musical The Shop Girl when he was 19 years old. This was soon followed by songs for, among others, the hit musical San Toy. In 1899, he wrote songs for the international hit Florodora, which brought him wider fame.  Producer George Edwardes hired him as an \"additional material\" writer for, among others, The Messenger Boy (1900), The Toreador  (1901), A Country Girl (1902), The Girl from Kays (1902), The School Girl (1903), The Cingalee (1904) and The Blue Moon (1905), writing some of the most successful songs in these shows.  He composed the hit musical Miss Hook of Holland (1907).\nLater compositions include The Balkan Princess (1910), The Sunshine Girl (1912), The Girl from Utah (1913), Tonight's the Night (1914), Betty (1915) and The Happy Day (1916).  Rubens began a relationship with the actress Phyllis Dare during this period, but they soon parted due to Rubens' severe consumptive illness, from which he suffered for the rest of his life. As a result, he retired to Cornwall and died of tuberculosis, aged 41.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jerome Kern", "response": ["Kern's first complete score was Broadway's The Red Petticoat (1912), one of the first musical-comedy Westerns.  The libretto was by Rida Johnson Young.  By World War I, more than a hundred of Kern's songs had been used in about thirty productions, mostly Broadway adaptations of West End and European shows.  Kern contributed two songs to To-Night's the Night (1914), another Rubens musical.  It opened in New York and went on to become a hit in London.  The best known of Kern's songs from this period is probably \"They Didn't Believe Me\", which was a hit in the New York version of the Paul Rubens and Sidney Jones musical, The Girl from Utah (1914), for which Kern wrote five songs. Kern's song, with four beats to a bar, departed from the customary waltz-rhythms of European influence and fitted the new American passion for modern dances such as the fox-trot.  He was also able to use elements of American styles, such as ragtime, as well as syncopation, in his lively dance tunes.Bordman, Gerald. \"Jerome David Kern, Innovator/Traditionalist\", The Musical Quarterly, Volume 71, no. 4, April 1985, pp. 468-73 Theatre historian John Kenrick writes that the song put Kern in great demand on Broadway and established a pattern for musical comedy love songs that lasted through the 1960s.Kenrick, John.  \"Jerome Kern: 'They Didn't Believe Me'\", History of The Musical Stage, 1910-1919: Part I, The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film (2008)", "The team's first Princess Theatre show was an adaptation of Paul Rubens' 1905 London show, Mr. Popple (of Ippleton), called Nobody Home (1915).

Kern and Bolton next created an original piece, Very Good Eddie, which was a surprise hit, running for 341 performances, with additional touring productions that went on into the 1918-19 season.
