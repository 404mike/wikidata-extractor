Unusual for a student-led organisation, it has hosted several recipients of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, most recently Amartya Sen, Oliver Hart, Eric Maskin, Peter Diamond, Roger Myerson, Paul Milgr\u00f6m and Joshua Angrist in 2021. It has also attracted high-profile economists in many fields such as Greg Mankiw, Tim Besley, Ha-Joon Chang, Silvana Tenreyro, Oriana Bandiera, Ricardo Reis, Charles Goodhart, Rachel Glennerster, Phillipe Aghion and Jeffery Sachs. Sen Club appears to invite economists with interesting research regardless of their background, however, as graduate students and undergraduates constitute a significant proportion of past speakers."]}]}}
