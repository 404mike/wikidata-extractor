He is the author of several books, some on chess openings and some on the endgame.\nHe was awarded the International Master title in 1983 and Grandmaster title in 1987.\nFlear created one of the greatest-ever chess tournament upsets when, as a last minute substitute, he won the very strong London 1986 event (ahead of Chandler, Short, Nunn, Ribli, Polugaevsky, Portisch, Spassky, Vaganian, Speelman, and Larsen, amongst others). To round off the happy occasion, he married five-time French Women's Champion Christine Leroy during the event. They have two sons, James and Nathan.\nHe also represented England at the 1986 Dubai Olympiad (earning a team silver medal) and at the European Team Chess Championship at Plovdiv in 2003.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess players", "response": ["* Glenn Flear (England, born 1959)"]}, {"page": "Knight (chess)", "response": ["Whereas two bishops cover each other's weaknesses, two knights tend not to cooperate with each other as efficiently.

Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca stated that a queen and knight work better together than a queen and bishop in the endgame . More recently, John Watson has stated that from his study of this endgame that an unusually large proportion of queen and knight versus queen and bishop endings are drawn, and that most decisive games are characterized by the winning side having one or more obvious advantages (for example, having a knight against a bad bishop in a  position, or having a bishop in a position with pawns on both sides of the board, particularly if the knight has no natural outpost). Watson states that positions in this endgame in general \"are very volatile, and often the winning side is simply the one who starts out being able to win material or launch an attack on the opposing king\" .  Glenn Flear agrees with that assessment for endgames.  He could not find an endgame by Capablanca that supported his statement.  The statistics for queen and bishop versus queen and knight endgames are about even.  Most decisive games were won because of a significant advantage from the middlegame and only a limited number of positions show an inherent superiority for one over the other ."]}, {"page": "British Rapidplay Chess Championships", "response": ["* 1988  Murray Chandler, Glenn Flear, Julian Hodgson and John Nunn "]}, {"page": "Swindle (chess)", "response": ["In the position at left, the natural 1...Kb4 would be a fatal blunder, turning a win into a loss after 2.Kd5!, reaching the noted tr\u00e9buchet position (diagram at right), where whoever is on move loses, a situation described as \"full-point mutual zugzwang.\"Glenn Flear, Starting Out: Pawn Endings, Everyman Chess, 2004, p. 13.
