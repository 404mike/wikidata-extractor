Turner. Indeed, his work is full of poetry. There is a solemn grandeur in his Alpine views and a sense of vastness, a tender tranquility and a kind of mystery in most of his paintings, leaving parts in his pictures for the imagination of the spectator to dwell on and search into. John Constable described Cozens as \"the greatest genius that ever touched landscape.\"\nIn June 2010 Cozen's Lake Albano (c.1777) sold at auction, at Sotheby's in London, for \u00a32.4 million, a record for any 18th-century British watercolour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "J.

This example popularized watercolors as a form of personal tourist journal. The confluence of these cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and amateur interests culminated in the celebration and promotion of watercolor as a distinctly English \"national art\". William Blake published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry, provided illustrations to Dante's Inferno, and he also experimented with large monotype works in watercolor.

Gayford visited Tillyer in Yorkshire, and discussed with him his ideas about nature and landscape and his thoughts concerning watercolour painting, his own and his most important predecessors', Alexander and John Robert Cozens, Turner, Cotman etc. The first months of 1993 saw a large exhibition of 'The Great Age of British Watercolours' at the Royal Academy, and it made good sense to get Tillyer's response to this on the way to focusing on his own use of the medium. Tillyer declared his interest in the founders of this 'great age', and distanced himself from the elaborately worked watercolours of the mid-Victorians, done, as he said, to compete with oil paintings but essentially unable to. \"Each medium has its own nature. It's what you're saying with the medium that's important.\" He emphasised the originality, the modernity, of the past painters he admired, and also his personal aversion to making topographical portraits of selected landscapes. But he also stressed the affinity of watercolours to the British landscape, and vice versa: \"Around here moisture appears actually to rise out of the ground, out of the earth. It almost feels as if the sky is being formed from the earth \u2013 a rising of moisture into the void of the sky. Watercolour is almost the very nature of landscape in itself, its own properties. Landscape is simply weather \u2013 air and water... To my mind, the pure use of watercolour involved starting from white paper, and then gradually working back \u2013 so that any light and air you want in the piece is the first mark you make.\" About the new series of paintings Gayford said very little. It was primarily Tillyer's watercolours he had gone to discuss, in the context both of 'the great age' and of Tillyer's thoughts about nature and about the Romantic/classical duality signalled so firmly in the Westwood and Living in Arcadia paintings. The new paintings were being prepared for their trip to London. Gayford mentioned the contrast each of them offered, the \"rather jarring opposition\" between the natural forms, usually on the right, and the geometrical forms, usually on the left, now made as cuts into the canvas-on-board front plane. He rightly emphasised both that contrast, which seemed to him like \"a contest, even a battle\", and the resolution of the two elements on the conceptual level, since nature's forms too are structured mathematically. He also explained Tillyer's use of the series title, Fearful Symmetries. The words echo William Blake's, in his poem The Tyger, but Tillyer says he took them from the title of a piece of music by the American composer John Adams. In many respects the new series continues methods and images initiated in the Living in Arcadia series. However, the new series, produced in 1992\u201393 is more concentrated, in that all the paintings have the same format and dimensions (36 x 42 inches), and are all set into the characteristic Tillyer timber frame, painted in various blue-greys. Ayton (1993), for example, is painted on uninterrupted canvas, sans wire mesh and sans planar recession, in thinned acrylic over white and could almost be a watercolour, a suitably delicate response to light and air."]}, {"page": "1797 in art", "response": ["* December 14 \u2013 John Robert Cozens, English draftsman and painter of romantic watercolor landscapes (born 1752)"]}, {"page": "1776 in art", "response": ["* John Robert Cozens sets out on a three-year tour of Switzerland and Italy."]}, {"page": "1797 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 14 December \u2013 John Robert Cozens, romantic watercolour landscape painter and draughtsman, insane (born 1752)"]}, {"page": "Abbot Hall Art Gallery", "response": ["It has one of the most important collections of George Romney\u2019s paintings in Britain and several of his sketchbooks and drawings.
