Shackleton and five companions set out in a small boat to summon help, and on 10 May, after an epic voyage, they landed at King Haakon Bay on South Georgia's south coast. While three stayed at the coast, Shackleton and the two others, Tom Crean and Frank Worsley, went on to cover  over the spine of the mountainous island to reach help at Stromness whaling station. The remaining 22 members of the expedition, who had stayed on Elephant Island, were subsequently rescued. In January 1922, during a later expedition, Shackleton died on board ship while moored in King Edward Cove, South Georgia. He is buried at Grytviken. The ashes of another noted Antarctic explorer, Frank Wild, who had been Shackleton's second-in-command on the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, were interred next to Shackleton in 2011."]}, {"page": "Tristan da Cunha", "response": ["* In Shackleton's Last Voyage by Captain Frank Wild (1923), several chapters (with photographs) recount events on the island during the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition in May\u00a01922."]}, {"page": "Ernest Shackleton", "response": ["The \"Great Southern Journey\", as Frank Wild called it, began on 29 October 1908. On 9 January 1909, Shackleton and three companions\u2014Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams\u2014reached a new Farthest South latitude of 88\u00b0\u00a023'\u00a0S, a point only  from the Pole. En route the South Pole party discovered the Beardmore Glacier\u2014named after Shackleton's patron\u2014and became the first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau. Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race against starvation, on half-rations for much of the way. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: \"All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me\". They arrived at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship.", "While Shackleton led the expedition, Captain F. Worsley commanded the Endurance and Lieutenant J. Stenhouse the Aurora. On the Endurance, the second in command was the experienced explorer Frank Wild. The meteorologist was Captain L. Hussey, also an able banjo player. McIlroy was head of the scientific staff, which included Wordie.", "Macklin, who conducted the postmortem, concluded that the cause of death was atheroma of the coronary arteries exacerbated by \"overstrain during a period of debility\". Leonard Hussey, a veteran of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic expedition, offered to accompany the body back to Britain; while he was in Montevideo en route to England, a message was received from Emily Shackleton asking that her husband be buried in South Georgia. Hussey returned to South Georgia with the body on the steamer , and on 5 March 1922, Shackleton was buried in the Grytviken cemetery, South Georgia, after a short service in the Lutheran church, with Edward Binnie officiating.Sir Ernest Shackleton: Funeral Ceremony In South Georgia: Many Wreaths On Coffin, in the Barrier Miner (archived in the NLA Trove); published 5 May 1922; retrieved 25 June 2014Shackleton's Last Voyage: the Story of the Quest, by Frank Wild, published 1923 by Cassell (via archive.org) Macklin wrote in his diary: \"I think this is as 'the Boss' would have had it himself, standing lonely in an island far from civilisation, surrounded by stormy tempestuous seas, & in the vicinity of one of his greatest exploits.\"", "On 27 November 2011, the ashes of Frank Wild were interred on the right-hand side of Shackleton's gravesite in Grytviken.
