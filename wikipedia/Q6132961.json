However, Shroot first team opportunities has become increasingly limited after not featuring in a match or the substitute bench. This just came when Shroot made a lazy back pass, allowing Leon Clarke to score in a 1\u20130 loss against Coventry City. To add an insult to an injury, Stevenage winless run was extended to six games. For the second time in 12 months, Shroot was placed on the transfer list, like he requested.

The hosts opened the scoring after fifteen minutes when Luke Freeman drove a left-wing ball across goal, which was ultimately turned into his own net by AFC Wimbledon defender Pim Balkestein. Stevenage doubled their advantage seven minutes before the interval. AFC Wimbledon goalkeeper Seb Brown mis-timed a heavy defensive back pass, with the ball falling to debutant James Dunne, who slotted the ball into an empty net. The visitors responded immediately, Brendan Kiernan reducing the deficit when he successfully connected with a Luke Moore cross. Just four minutes later, in first-half injury time, Stevenage restored their two-goal cushion. A Greg Tansey free-kick was met on the half-volley by Marcus Haber; with Haber's volley goalbound, captain Mark Roberts slid in at the back post to ensure the ball crossed the line.
