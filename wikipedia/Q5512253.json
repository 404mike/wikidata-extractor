Diggle contributed articles to the British Chess Magazine (BCM) from 1933 to 1981, and to the British Chess Federation's publications Newsflash and Chess Moves from 1974 to 1992. C.H.O'D. Alexander called Diggle \"one of the best writers on chess that I know\". In his A Book of Chess, Alexander reproduced in toto Diggle's account, first published in the November and December 1943 BCM, of the match between Staunton and St. Amant.After Diggle told Alexander of a game he had lost in seven moves (1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Bxf7+?! Kxf7 5.Nxe4 Nc6 6.Qf3+ Kg8?? 7.Ng5! 1-0 Davids-Diggle, London Banks League 1949), Alexander affectionately christened Diggle \"the Badmaster\", a facetious counterpoint to the more familiar title Grandmaster. Diggle later adopted the sobriquet as a pseudonym, writing a series of articles in Newsflash under that name between 1974 and 1986.Chess historian Edward Winter wrote the following in his remembrance of Diggle in CHESS magazine:\nSpecializing in nineteenth-century chess history (particularly the Staunton period), he brought the old masters to life with rare wit and shrewdness. These qualities also permeated his accounts of the idiosyncratic doings and sayings of club \"characters\", such as the elderly player \"who fumbled his way to perdition at reasonable speed until he was a queen and two minor pieces to the bad, after which he discovered that 'every move demanded the nicest calculation'\", or \"the Lincoln bottom board of 1922, who complained that he had 'lost his queen about the third move and couldn\u2019t seem to get going after that'.\"\nA former county champion, G.H.D. was charmingly self-deprecatory in his reminiscences, as when he had a game adjudicated by Tartakower: \"The Great Master, having been fetched, sat down at the board very simply and unaffectedly, and drank in through his spectacles the fruits (and probably the whole deplorable history) of the Badmaster\u2019s afternoon strategy.\"\nLittle escaped G.H.D.'s eye, even towards the end. Modestly adapting Oscar Wilde, he claimed to have \"nothing to declare but his longevity\", simply adding that he had \"mingled from time to time with three generations of eminent players ranging from Isidor Gunsberg to Nigel Short, and rambled extensively round the highways and byways of provincial chess\". He was one of the game's most stylish chroniclers.\nIn 1984 and 1987, Chess Notes published two collections of Diggle's Newsflash articles as Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster and Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster, Volume II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Howard Staunton", "response": ["G.

In the position diagrammed at far left, White appears to be losing a piece. His queen is under attack, and if 32.Qe4 (to save his bishop on d3), Black plays 32...Ng5 33.Qg2 (for example) Rxd3 and wins. St. Amant produced 32.b5!!, which Staunton called, \"A desperate but masterly resource.\"Howard Staunton, The Chess-Player's Companion, Henry C. Bohn, 1859, p. 336. G.H. Diggle referred to it, equally accurately, as \"a move looking so irrelevant that everyone must have thought for a moment that it was merely a petulant way of resigning\".Diggle, p. 11. Although it should not have saved the game, the move in fact has three points: (1) it attacks Black's bishop; (2) after 32...Rxd4 33.exd4 (threatening a back-rank mate and discovering an attack on Black's queen), it prevents the bishop from guarding the e8 square; and (3) after 32...Rxd4 33.exd4, it prevents the queen from defending e8 with 33...Qc6.

N. Coles, Howard Staunton: The English World Champion, British Chess Magazine, 1975, p. 66. Instead, Staunton played 32...Qh5? immediately. After St. Amant's 33.g4!, he should have played 33...Qh4 34.Qxa4 Rxd3. But shattered by the realization that he had thrown away a win, Staunton blundered again with 33...Rxd4?? 34.exd4! f6 35.gxh5 and Black resigned. The two winning lines for Black are sufficiently difficult that Staunton, annotating the game 16 years later in his Chess Player's Companion, gave neither of them, instead recommending a line leading to a probable draw by perpetual check."]}, {"page": "Staunton\u2013Morphy controversy", "response": ["Chess historian G.

His profession is described in the 1871, 1881, and 1891 United Kingdom censuses, respectively, as a \"translator of languages\", an \"author of work on chess\", and a member of the \"literary profession\". He lived for over five years in Paris, contributing to French publications. From 1879 to 1880 he was \"employed occasionally as translator and otherwise\" in The Times of London's office in Paris.
