Laing noted, however, that the political themes of the album are damped a little by Blegvad and Moore's \"War\", which he felt is \"musically limp and politically liberal\", and by the presence of the two \"experimental\" instrumentals.

In his official biography, Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, McCartney says he wrote the song \"when I was fourteen just after I'd lost my mother\"., quoted in  In The Beatles: The Biography, Bob Spitz writes McCartney wrote the song in 1956 soon after his mother Mary's death on 29 October 1956 and that, \"McCartney remains vague about a correlation between the two events.\" Writer and research fellow Dave Laing writes McCartney wrote the song sometime between his mother's death and the summer of 1957. Lewisohn writes McCartney wrote the song in late 1957, around the time John Lennon wrote Hello Little Girl. In particular, Lewisohn notes that when McCartney sings the song he includes \"a [Buddy] Holly hiccup, pinpointing its creation to post-September 1957,\" the month McCartney and Lennon first heard the Crickets' song \"That'll Be the Day\". Everett agrees with Lewisohn that the Holly-like vocalizations in lines 8\u201310 of the song likely post-date McCartney's first hearing Holly in late 1957, but contends that those were later additions and that he had already written the rest of the song before that point."]}, {"page": "Phil Hardy (journalist)", "response": ["He wrote or edited several books on music and film, including Samuel Fuller (1970), The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies (1986), and The British Film Institute Companion to Crime (1997).
