The item rule was later changed so that teams have to buy three items. After Tim Wonnacott became host, the money was increased to \u00a3300, and a new feature called the \"swap item\" was introduced. Each expert chose an item of their own, and the team could replace one of their own choices with the \"swap item\" if they wished to. The host, when offering the option to a team, would often ask, \"Swap or No Swap?\" Originally, the experts were given an unspecified amount of money to buy the extra item; the rule was later changed so that the experts could only use whatever money was left of the team's \u00a3300 budget (the remaining money was referred to by Wonnacott as the \"leftover lolly\"). Under the revised rule, if a team used its entire budget, the expert could not choose a \"swap item\".", "Originally a daytime show when launched in 2000 with game host David Dickinson. Later a primetime version, hosted by Dickinson, was also made (2002\u20132004), which was similar to the daytime show except that the teams' budget was increased to \u00a3500. It was on this version of the show that the record was set for the greatest profit earned on Bargain Hunt.
