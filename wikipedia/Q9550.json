Her accolades include four Filmfare Award nominations.\nBorn in Hong Kong, Kaif lived in several countries before she moved to London. She received her first modelling assignment as a teenager and later pursued a career as a fashion model. At a fashion show in London, Indian filmmaker Kaizad Gustad decided to cast her in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career, however, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles, and inclination to male-dominated films.\nHer performance in the thriller New York (2009) earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, and after starring roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010), and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), she received her second nomination for her performance in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011). Kaif's highest-grossing films came with the action thrillers Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Dhoom 3 (2013), and Bang Bang! (2014), all of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films. She followed this with a series of films which did not perform well commercially, with the exception of the action sequel Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and the drama Bharat (2019), but received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of an alcoholic actress in the romantic drama Zero (2018).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amitabh Bachchan", "response": ["In 2017, he appeared in the third instalment of the Sarkar film series: Ram Gopal Varma's Sarkar 3.
