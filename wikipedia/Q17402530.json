He was born in Georgetown, Demerara-Mahaica, British Guiana (present day Guyana).\nTaitt first competed internationally at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, Wales. Representing British Guiana, he reached the semi finals of the 120 yards hurdles. Four years later, now representing Great Britain, Taitt reached the semi finals of the 110 metres hurdles at the 1962 European Athletics Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Two months later representing England, Taitt won the bronze medal in the 120 yards hurdles at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Western Australia in a time of 14.7 seconds. He was also due to compete in the high jump but pulled out to focus on the hurdles. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Taitt in the 110 metres hurdles finished fourth in his heat after crossing the line in 14.5 seconds. This was not enough for him to advance to the semi finals. Two years later at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, Taitt finished fifth in the final of the 120 yards hurdles in a time of 14.3 seconds. At his final major meet, the 1966 European Athletics Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Taitt was unable to make the final of the 110 metres hurdles.Taitt died on 18 October 2006 in Croydon, Greater London, England at the age of 72.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 28", "response": ["*  1934   \u2013 Laurie Taitt, Guyanese-English hurdler (d. 2006)"]}, {"page": "October 18", "response": ["*  2006   \u2013 Laurie Taitt, Guyanese-English hurdler (b. 1934)"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1964 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 110 metres hurdles", "response": ["| 4 || 6 ||align=left| Laurie Taitt ||align=left|  || 14.5 || 14.52 || "]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2006", "response": ["*Laurie Taitt, 72, British sprint hurdler."]}, {"page": "2006 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Laurie Taitt, Olympic sprint hurdler (born 1934)"]}, {"page": "1934 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 28 March \u2013 Laurie Taitt, Olympic sprint hurdler (died 2006)"]}, {"page": "List of English people", "response": ["* Laurie Taitt (1934\u20132006), Olympic sprint hurdler"]}, {"page": "List of Guyanese Britons", "response": ["* Laurie Taitt (1934\u20132006), Olympic sprint hurdler"]}, {"page": "2006 in England", "response": ["* 18 October \u2013 Laurie Taitt, Olympic sprint hurdler (born 1934)"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 120 yards hurdles", "response": ["The event was won by Pakistan's Ghulam Raziq in 14.3 seconds, ahead of Australia's Dave Prince and Laurie Taitt from England who won bronze.
