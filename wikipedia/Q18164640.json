He launched his attack as soon as firing was heard from Snake Hill. Surprise was quickly lost when American pickets detected them and fired muskets to alert the defenders. Once the British had moved close enough, the guns of the fort and the Douglass Battery (loaded with canister) and several hundred U.S. Infantry opened fire, causing horrific losses to the British who were jammed into a narrow front between an embankment and the lake. Colonel Scott was mortally wounded by a musket ball in the head early in the attack. His second in command, Major William Smelt, was also seriously wounded. At one point in the battle, a cry rose from the British forces of \"Stop firing, you're shooting your own men!\", and the fighting ceased for almost an entire minute until an American officer, unconvinced by the unfamiliarly accented appeal, shouted back \"To Hell with you!\" and the firing resumed. Scott's shattered regiment fell back with 360 casualties (although some may later have joined Drummond's attack against the fort). The Americans facing them reported no casualties from Scott's attack.Cruikshank (in Zaslow), pp.160-161"]}, {"page": "103rd Regiment of Foot (1806)", "response": ["During the battle, the regiment melted away at the sight of just a couple American volleys. However, they were rallied by the extra-ordinary exertions of Major William Smelt. After another desperate assault, the British succeeded in forcing their way into the battery.
