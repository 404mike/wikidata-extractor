Shaw was keen on the idea and formed a plan to create the college. Shaw, who was a member of the GVS, realised the potential of the society as a step to creating the college. In October 1924, Shaw met with Blair-Bell at a rough shooting meet in the North Lancashire fells to discuss the idea and persuade him of its merits. Blair-Bell discussed the idea with several people including Sir Ewen Maclean, the first Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the University of Wales and Sir Comyns Berkeley, obstetric and gynaecological surgeon. Together a plan was formed to discuss the new college idea at the next GVS meeting on 2 February 1925. The GVS were enthused by the idea, and a committee was formed by Shaw, Blair-Bell, Maclean and several others to draw up a detailed plan."]}, {"page": "1942 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor William Fletcher Shaw, , President, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists."]}, {"page": "Template talk:Post-nominals/Archive 2", "response": ["Dear   It seems that many doctors in the UK for the first half of the 20th century certainly (roughly), who had steller careers were awarded Honarary LLD's, e.g. William Fletcher Shaw near or at the end of their careers.
