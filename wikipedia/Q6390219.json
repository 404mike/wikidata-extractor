He was accompanied on that occasion by the Duke of Wellington and Kenneth Howard, 1st Earl of Effingham. King William IV (1830\u20131837) held no coronation banquet in 1831, so the King's Champion was not called upon to act. At the Coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, it was decided not to include the traditional ride and challenge of the Champion, and in recompense, in 1841 Henry Dymoke was made a baronet. The ceremony has never been revived.Plunkett, John, Queen Victoria: First Media Monarch, p. 23, 2003, Oxford University Press, , 9780199253920, google books; Strong, Roy, Queen Victoria's Coronation at: Royal Archives: RA VIC/MAIN/QVJ (W) Queen Victoria's Coronation, by Sir Roy Strong (Essay).
