During this period, the New Zealanders captured the village of La Basseville but subsequently lost it to a German counterattack. At the end of the month, 2nd Wellington Battalion, 1st Brigade, retook the village with Lance-Corporal Leslie Andrew playing a key role in the action; he was later awarded the VC for his efforts. Over the following few weeks the men of the division worked to consolidate their positions in waterlogged trenches, rain having set in. Casualties were still incurred during this period including Brigadier General Johnston, killed by a sniper on 7 August while inspecting his new command, the Rifle Brigade. His replacement, Brigadier General Robert Young, was severely wounded by another sniper just two days later."]}, {"page": "New Zealand Rifle Brigade (Earl of Liverpool's Own)", "response": ["*Robert Young: August 1917;"]}, {"page": "List of New Zealand military personnel", "response": ["* Robert Young - senior officer who commanded an infantry brigade on the Western Front; later Commandant of New Zealand Military Forces, from 1925 to 1931"]}, {"page": "Second Battle of Bapaume", "response": ["It was planned that the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move past 1st Infantry Brigade once Gr\u00e9villers was captured but it was forced into action early, when its commander, Brigadier General Robert Young, seeing that the 37th Division was struggling to take its objective of Biefvillers, decided to use his brigade to assist.
