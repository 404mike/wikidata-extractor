He set up the first residential treatment centre for sex offenders, the Gracewell Clinic, in 1988 in Birmingham.Wyre had three children, all from his first marriage, which ended in divorce.

However, after interviewing Lavery, Gladwell wrote a second New Yorker article in which he characterized Lavery's appropriation as \"permissible borrowing.\" Lavery, for her part, acknowledged that all three characters were drawn heavily from external sources. For the character of Ralph, she drew on the book The Murder of Childhood by Ray Wyre and Tim Tate. For the character of Nancy, she drew on an article in The Guardian by Marian Partington, whose sister Lucy had been murdered by the serial killers Fred and Rosemary West.

According to Ray Wyre, a pioneer in the treatment of sex offenders who conducted several interviews with Black between 1990 and 1993, the prime reason for this was an issue of control for Black. Wyre summarised the psychology behind Black's refusal to cooperate with investigators: He's the sort of person for whom it's all about power and control. Having information about what he's done gives him power. He has no desire to ease his conscience, and he's not going to give up the one thing that gives him power over the pain that his victims' families are suffering. The closest Black ever came to confessing to any of his crimes was shortly before his 1994 trial, when Wyre asked why he had never denied any of the charges brought against him. According to Wyre, Black replied, \"Because I couldn't.\"", "* Scottish Television broadcast a 25-minute documentary relating to Black's crimes on the date of his 1994 murder convictions. It contains interviews with Hector Clark, David Herkes and Ray Wyre, and archive footage dating from the manhunt for Black."]}, {"page": "Raymond Wyre", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ray Wyre"]}, {"page": "Raymond Keith Wyre", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ray Wyre"]}, {"page": "Ray Keith Wyre", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ray Wyre"]}]}}
