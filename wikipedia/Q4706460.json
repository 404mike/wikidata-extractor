He would also serve as Dean of the Faculty of Medical Sciences.  In 1985 he joined the University of Cambridge as a British Council Fellow, working with Alan Cuthbert on how drugs cross the membrane of the eye. He attended a conference in the United States, where he heard that marijuana can lower intraocular pressure. He pioneered the use of marijuana as a treatment for Glaucoma, and was co-inventor of canasol with Albert Lockhart. Canasol is still one of the most popular drugs for treating glaucoma. They were awarded a $20,000 CIDA grant to develop to medicine. They went on to co-invent Asmasol. He died on April 24, 2012."]}]}}
