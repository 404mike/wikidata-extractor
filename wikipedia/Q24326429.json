During the year he commissioned Penske to build a chassis, the Rebaque HR100. The design of the car - by Geoff Ferris with input from John Barnard - was heavily influenced by the design of the Lotus 79, also incorporating some elements of the Williams FW07's sidepods. It was completed in time for the Italian Grand Prix that year, although it either failed to qualify or to finish the final three races of the year. The team was closed down at the end of the year.

Initiated by Ron Tauranac, designed by Geoff Ferris, and built by a team including Nick Goozee (monocoque) and Bob Paton (construction), it was one of the last cars produced by MRD before MRD was closed by the then new Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone. Based on the Formula Two Brabham BT40 (which was also designed by Geoff Ferris) the BT43 featured a modified monocoque that incorporated the triangular cross section pioneered by the Brabham BT42 Formula One car which was designed by Gordon Murray. This distinctive pyramid shape not only kept the aerodynamic \"stagnation point\" low but also neatly allowed the incorporation of a \"crushable structure\" as required by the 1973 regulations which specified that all fuel tanks were to be protected by deformable structures. Engine and gearbox were the then de facto F5000 standard combination of a Chevrolet 302 cubic inch engine in an unstressed mounting and a Hewland DG300 gearbox. The fitment of these into what was a relatively small Formula Two sized car presented some design challenges. Front suspension components were BT40 while rear suspension components were a combination of Formula One and BT40."]}, {"page": "Geoff Ferris (Motorsport)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoff Ferris (motorsport)"]}, {"page": "Penske PC1", "response": ["The Penske PC1 was a Formula One racing car developed and raced by Penske Racing during the 1974 and 1975 Formula One seasons.

McRae Cars had been founded by New Zealand racing driver and constructor Graeme McRae, a globally successful designer and competitor in the F5000 racing formula.

Designed by Geoff Ferris, it is considered possibly the most dominant Penske race car design ever and that from a team that typically dominated. Rick Mears has been quoted as acknowledging this was his favorite racecar chassis ever.  Twelve total were made (1-12), six raced by Penske (1-6), with four confirmed destroyed (4, 7, 8, 11). They were manufactured at Penske Cars, Ltd. in Poole, England during 1982, and delivered to Penske Racing, Inc., in Reading, Pennsylvania. So outstanding was the PC-10's design, it won the prestigious Louis Schwitzer Award for innovation and engineering excellence in the field of race car design at the Indianapolis 500 in 1982. The PC-10s were active in the years 1982\u20131984. In fact, the PC-10 was ultimately much better than the following year PC-11, so Roger Penske bought back one of the PC-10s he had sold to another team for the 1983 season, and which then won another race for his team."]}]}}
