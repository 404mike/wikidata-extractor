He was born in Brixton and was initially associated with Surrey but he went on to represent other teams. The full span of his career is uncertain but he was definitely active between 1773 and 1780, playing in eight first-class matches. According to CricketArchive, Stone resurrected his career with two further matches in the 1790 season, but it cannot be said with certainty that this was the same man, especially as he seems to have moved from Surrey to Kent.\n There is nothing in the main source, Scores & Biographies, to suggest a link and he is always listed in its scorecards as \"Stone, Esq.\" Stone's highest score of 35 was achieved in his first known appearance when he played for Surrey against Kent in 1773. CricketArchive credits him with 117 career runs and 3 catches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stone (surname)", "response": ["*Robert Stone (disambiguation), several people including", ":*Robert Stone (architect) (born 1968), American architect based in Southern California", ":*Robert Stone (athlete) (born 1965), Australian sprinter", ":*Robert Stone (attorney) (1866\u20131957), Speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives, 1915", ":*Robert Stone (basketball) (born 1987), Australian basketball player", ":*Robert Stone (British Army officer) (1890\u20131974)", ":*Robert Stone (composer) (1516\u20131614), English composer", ":*Robert Stone (cricketer) (1749\u20131820), English amateur cricketer", ":*Robert Stone (director), Oscar-nominated documentary director for Radio Bikini", ":*Robert Stone (novelist) (1937\u20132015), U.S. author, journalist", ":*Robert Stone (rugby league) (1956\u20132005), Australian player for St. George Dragons", ":*Robert Stone (scientist) (born 1922), professor, doctor, director National Institutes of Health", ":*Robert Stone (silversmith) (1903\u20131990), English silversmith", ":*Robert Stone (trail guide writer) (born 1951), writer of hiking books  "]}, {"page": "Robert Stone", "response": ["Robert Stone may refer to:", "* Robert Stone (attorney) (1866\u20131957), Speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives, 1915", "* Robert Stone (novelist) (1937\u20132015), American author, journalist", "* Robert Stone (composer) (1516\u20131614), English composer", "* Robert Stone (director), Oscar-nominated documentary director for Radio Bikini", "* Robert Stone (rugby league) (1956\u20132005), Australian player for St. George Dragons", "* Robert Stone (silversmith) (1903\u20131990), English silversmith", "* Robert Stone (architect) (born 1968), American architect based in Southern California", "* Robert Stone (scientist) (1922\u20132016), professor, doctor, past National Institutes of Health director", "* Robert Stone (trail guide writer) (born 1951), writer of hiking books  ", "* Robert Stone (wrestler) (born 1983), American professional wrestler", "* Robert Stone (cricketer) (1749\u20131820), English amateur cricketer", "* Robert Stone (athlete) (born 1965), Australian former sprinter", "* Robert Stone (basketball) (born 1987), Australian basketball player", "* Robert Stone (British Army officer) (1890\u20131974)"]}, {"page": "Stone (Surrey cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Stone (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Stone (Kent cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Stone (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Stone (1790 Kent cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Stone (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|Robert Stone"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1772\u20131786)", "response": ["|Robert Stone"]}]}}
