His success was attributable to a number of factors: he regularly visited the troops on the ground which gave him a good picture of the difficulties faced in particular areas; once a unit or commander had proved itself, he was happy to delegate considerable authority, in particular to his immediate subordinate, Commander Land Forces (Sir) Peter Leng; he had a good relationship with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, who said of King \"You have never played at politics and I have never played at being a soldier; that's why we have got on so well.\" He was replaced in the post by Lieutenant-General Sir David House on 1 August 1975.
