His first major exposure came in 1979 when he was selected as the opening act for a Fleetwood Mac tour. Mac member Christine McVie went on to produce Patton's second and third albums, and played keyboards on them; Lindsey Buckingham played guitar on Patton's hit single, \"Don't Give it Up\", and Stevie Nicks sang on \"Smiling Islands\". Patton returned the favour by co-writing the hit \"Hold Me\", which appeared on Fleetwood Mac's 1982 album, Mirage.
