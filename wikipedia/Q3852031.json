Pugh and full-back Charlie Daniels formed a partnership on the left-hand side of the pitch during 2014\u201315, the duo starting all matches but one of a 14-match unbeaten run for Bournemouth. He scored the first goal in a 3\u20130 win over Bolton Wanderers on 27 April 2015 with a left-footed shot into the top corner; this result all but sealed Bournemouth's promotion into the Premier League. He played in a 3\u20130 away win against Charlton on 2 May 2015, which confirmed promotion and, thanks to Watford drawing their last match, the Championship title.
