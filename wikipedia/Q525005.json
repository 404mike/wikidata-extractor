Although released under the name of The Cure, \"Wrong Number\" was one of several \"one-off\" studio projects recorded during this period by Robert Smith either performing solo, or with guest musicians from outside the full-time line-up of The Cure. Earlier versions of the song had already been recorded by the band, but Plati and Smith completely reconstructed the track, built around a sampled drum loop by Cure drummer Jason Cooper. Smith and Plati added keyboards, effects and new vocals, while Gabrels laid down \"a gazillion guitar tracks\".Apter, Jeff.

The following month, Smith was again recording solo between RAK and Outside studios, assisted this time by co-producer Paul Corkett, whose production credits included Nick Cave, Bj\u00f6rk, Placebo, Tori Amos and Suede. These sessions produced \"More Than This\" (not to be confused with the Roxy Music song) for The X-Files: The Album, and a cover of Depeche Mode's \"World in My Eyes\" for the tribute album For the Masses. Again, both were released under the name of the Cure, but were essentially Robert Smith solo recordings. Smith said: Having made a guest appearance on an episode of South Park earlier in the year (see \u2192 South Park: Mecha-Streisand), Smith again collaborated with Trey Parker under the name COGASM, featuring Reeves Gabrels and Jason Cooper, releasing the track \"A Sign from God\" for the film Orgazmo.
