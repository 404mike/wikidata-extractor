He inherited wealth from his grandfather, who with seven of his sons, had developed and prospered from coal and iron workings.

Langtry had a small number of horses in training at Baird's stable and after his death moved them to Kentford - about 3 miles from Moulton Paddocks.

The last of his wins came in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket on October 27 when he led all the way to beat Raeburn by half a length. According to rules governing the sport of British horse racing in effect at the time, when his owner George Alexander Baird died, all of Meddler's future race bookings were void. As such, Meddler could not race in the British Classic Races at age three and was sold for $76,000 to American William H. Forbes of Readville, Massachusetts who brought him to the United States in 1893 to stand at his Neponset Stud. On Forbes' death in 1894, Meddler was purchased by William Collins Whitney of New York city who sent him to stand at stud at his La Belle Stud at Lexington, Kentucky."]}, {"page": "Merry Hampton", "response": ["Merry Hampton was bred at the Cottingham Stud in Yorkshire by J. Crowther Harrison. He was a dark bay horse standing 16 hands high, and although strong and \"wiry\" he was not a particularly attractive individual, being described by one observer as \"jumped up, peacocky (and) lacking in depth.\" He was sold as a yearling in September 1885 at the Doncaster sales for 3,100 guineas to George Alexander Baird, who ran in his racing interests under the name of \u201cMr. Abington\u201d. Baird, who had inherited a vast fortune at a young age, had been a talented amateur rider before being banned for \u201cfoul riding\u201d at the age of twenty-one and was ill-disposed towards the racing \u201cestablishment\u201d. By 1886, Baird\u2019s relationship with his trainer, Martin Gurry, had broken down, and so the colt was sent into training with William Stevens in Berkshire. In May 1887, however, Baird was reconciled with Gurry and Merry Hampton was removed from Stevens and sent to  Gurry\u2019s Bedford Lodge stable at Newmarket.", "thumb|right|200px|George Alexander Baird, Merry Hampton's owner, in his days as an amateur jockey."]}, {"page": "List of Vanity Fair (British magazine) caricatures (1885\u20131889)", "response": ["|1888-10-06||Mr George Alexander Baird||Mr Abington||Lib||M 0412||25px"]}, {"page": "Busybody (horse)", "response": ["Before the 1884 flat racing season began, Lord Falmouth decided to retire from the turf and sell all his horses at a public auction.

At Newmarket on 28 April Busybody was sold for \u00a38,800 to Tom Cannon, acting on behalf of George Alexander Baird (also known as \"Mr. Abington\").

The yacht hit bad weather on the journey from Cowes and some damage to the living quarters occurred which had to be repaired after arrival at Marseilles.  It was during the Mediterranean cruise that Langtry learnt of the death of George Alexander Baird on March 18, 1893 in New Orleans.  She immediately made for Nice and caught the train back to London. The White Ladye returned to Cowes in April of that year and by July was in America under charter to Goelet."]}, {"page": "Tom Cannon Sr.", "response": ["In the twilight of his riding career, he became retained jockey for Scottish millionaire, George Alexander Baird.

The best horse he rode for Baird was Busybody, who he also trained."]}, {"page": "James Octavius Machell", "response": ["When his army life and racing started to conflict, he resigned his commission and took stables in Kennet near Newmarket, Suffolk with a small string of horses.  He would bring off a betting coup at the 1864 Newmarket spring meeting with Bacchus, a horse he had owned and run in Ireland.   The funds from this and further wins enabled Machell to purchase Bedford Cottage stables in Newmarket.  Here he employed George Bloss to act as trainer, whilst he retained strategic control and management of the horses and stables.  Later trainers were Joe Cannon and James Jewitt.

Tom Cannon trained Gebhard's English based horses at his Danebury stables. George Alexander Baird, who would later figure in Langtry's life, had horses in training at the same stable.  Several of Gebhard's horses were killed in 1887 when they were being transported by rail in America.  The train, en route to California, de-railed and the carriages tumbled down an embankment and caught fire. Another fire in 1900 destroyed the stables in his country home at Westbury, Long Island but the animals were rescued."]}, {"page": "La Sagesse (horse)", "response": ["La Sagesse was a bay mare bred in England by George Alexander Baird.
