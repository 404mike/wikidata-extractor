One writer has described his style as 'a kind of ascetically sumptuous exoticism', and has further characterised Dale Roberts' music in terms of:\n\nthe miniature form and associated possibilities of extended structuring;\nreference to artists and works in other art-forms (in particular sculpture and painting);\nthe occasional use of quotation from other composers\u2019 music (albeit in the context of a rather 'pure' modernist idiolect); and\na fondness for unusual instrumentations.A review of the CD recording of Croquis noted: \"Dale Roberts\u2019s miniatures are brilliantly able to condense a familiar image, such as the reel or the fugue, and accumulate into a substantial, 54-minute statement.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Jeremy Dale Roberts || 1934 || 2017 ||  English ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Tarik O'Regan", "response": ["Tarik O'Regan was born in London in 1978.
