In 1814 he was appointed botanical collector to the gardens, with Allan Cunningham. They went to Brazil for two years, making collections of plants and seeds.\nIn 1817 Bowie was sent to the Cape; here he made journeys into the interior, and gathered collections of living and dried plants, while making drawings for the Kew herbarium; the dried specimens went mostly to the British Museum. A vote of the House of Commons having reduced the sum granted for botanical collectors, Bowie was recalled in 1823, taking up his residence at Kew.\nAfter four years of inactivity he set out again for the Cape, where he was for some years gardener to Baron von Ludwig. He became a correspondent of William Henry Harvey, who dedicated the genus Bowiea to him.\nBowie left his employment in or before 1841, and made journeys into the interior to collect plants for sale. He died in poverty in 1869.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allan Cunningham (botanist)", "response": ["On Banks' recommendation, Cunningham went to Brazil with James Bowie between 1814 and 1816 collecting specimens for Kew Gardens.

Among other explorations, he joined John Oxley's 1817 expedition beyond the Blue Mountains to the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers and shared in the privations of the 1,200 miles (1,930\u00a0km) journey.

Besides large numbers of trees, shrubs and bulbs from Europe, America and Australia, he also included fruit trees, vegetables and crop plants. He introduced the Jacaranda tree to South Africa. Many of the species were indigenous, some acquired from Ecklon and Zeyher. The Irish botanist, Harvey, noted his appreciation of the easy access that was provided for studying the plants. Other prominent scientists such as Charles Bunbury and Joseph Dalton Hooker visited what had become known as Ludwigsburg Garden, while Lady Jane Franklin, who explored the garden in 1836, noted that even though only 3 acres in extent 'being well laid out with numerous divisions and paths' made it appear larger. The astronomer John Herschel used a camera lucida to sketch the developing site in 1834 (see drawing above).Cape Landscapes - Sir John Herschel's Sketches 1834-1838 A certain Leibold was first superintendent of the garden from 1834\u201337, followed by James Bowie over the period 1838-42, and Thomas Draper 1843-47 until Ludwig's death. The botanist Ludwig Pappe, later Colonial Botanist, prepared herbarium specimens from the garden plants."]}, {"page": "Streptocarpus rexii", "response": ["James Bowie, the Kew's botanical collector, first collected specimens and seeds of this plant in 1818 near Knysna on the estates of George Rex and sent these to Kew, asking that the plant be named after the legendary Rex. It was consequently named Didymocarpus rexii by William Jackson Hooker. John Lindley disagreed with Hooker's classification, creating a new genus and renaming the plant Streptocarpus rexii when he published plate 1173 in the 1828 edition of The Botanical Register. The botanist Gustav Heynhold also became involved and in 1840 published it as Henckelia rexii Heynh. in Nomenclator Botanicus Hortensis. Streptocarpus\u00a0rexii is a stemless herb growing to a height of about , and forming a rosette of velvety, strap-shaped leaves that are up to  long. Each leaf grows separately from the base of the plant, becoming an individual plant with its own roots and inflorescence. The fruit is a spirally-twisted two-valved capsule releasing minute seeds when mature."]}, {"page": "Georg Ludwig Engelhard Krebs", "response": ["In 1822 Krebs collected at Uitenhage, Sundays River, Galgenbosch, Van Stadens River, Zuurberg and Swartkops, sending four consignments to Lichtenstein, which consisted mainly of birds, mammals and insects, but with some bulbs and succulent plants, assisted and advised by James Bowie. In 1823 he roamed further afield visiting the Bushmans, Kariega  and Kowie Rivers, sending off his eighth consignment of 3800 insects, some 100 birds and no plants."]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Bowie\"|James Bowie"]}]}}
