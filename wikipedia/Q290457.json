He was, said his obituary in Wisden, \"notably enthusiastic\". He had been at Cambridge University, but appeared there in only one trial match for \"seniors\", and never made the first-class cricket side. He was also passed over at Cambridge for hockey, failing to win his university Blue for the sport, though he later played three times for the England team.\nIn 1931, he played cricket regularly for Somerset, though his highest score was only 55 and he averaged just 16 runs per innings. The following year, 1932, he hit centuries against Northamptonshire and Warwickshire, the former \u2013 135 in 180 minutes at Kettering \u2013 remaining the highest score of his career, and his average rose to 27. This record was \"as good as that of any other member of the team,\" said Wisden.In 1933, though there were no further centuries, Burrough reached 1000 runs in a season for the only time in his career, finishing with 1007. This was his last season for full-time cricket, although he continued to play fairly regularly until 1939, with two further centuries in 1935 and 1937. After the Second World War, he played just three first-class matches, without success.\nLike his county captains Reggie Ingle and Bunty Longrigg, Burrough was a solicitor in Bath. He also played for Bath Cricket Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Gimblett", "response": ["On the final Friday of Gimblett's trial, Somerset found themselves a player short for the match that started the following day against Essex at Frome when the amateur Laurie Hawkins reported in sick. Gimblett was told to get himself to Frome: Daniell arranged for the wicketkeeper Wally Luckes, who had a car, to pick him up from Bridgwater. Gimblett missed the bus from Taunton, and hitched a lift in a lorry. Somerset won the toss and chose to bat: three batsmen were out for 35, and at lunch the score was 105 for five. Soon after lunch, Dickie Burrough was out and Gimblett came to the wicket with Somerset six wickets down for 107 runs, joining Arthur Wellard.Foot, pp. 64\u201366."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Dickie Burrough (1927\u20131947) 171 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Reggie Ingle", "response": ["A right-handed middle-order batsman, Ingle was a regular player for 10 years in the Somerset side from 1927 to 1937, an era in which the team's batting was dominated by amateur cricketers. A member of a legal family from Bath, Ingle himself practised as a solicitor in the city and for much of the 1930s, the Somerset side had three Bath solicitors in its ranks, with Bunty Longrigg, Ingle's successor as captain, appearing alongside Dickie Burrough."]}, {"page": "Michael Bennett (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1932, Bennett played in every Somerset match, making 544 runs at an average of 15.54. He scarcely bowled at all, with just 7.3 overs in the season, and at times in a fairly mobile batting line-up he came in as low as No 10 in the batting order. Nonetheless, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, summarising the Somerset season, noted that he \"accomplished enough as a batsman to keep his place in the side\". His one score of more than 50 in the season came in the final home match of the season at Taunton: he made 69 batting at No 8, but his innings was upstaged by centuries for Reggie Ingle and Dickie Burrough and a very fast 50 from Arthur Wellard."]}, {"page": "William Burrough (cricketer)", "response": ["His older brother John Burrough played first-class cricket for Cambridge University between 1893 and 1895, and William's son Dickie Burrough played 171 matches as a right-handed batsman for Somerset between 1927 and 1947.
