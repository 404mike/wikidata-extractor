The psychiatrist further recalled that Stone had threatened his probation officer with a hammer. The psychiatrist also told police that the threats were so aggressive that they had made him fear for his own safety and for the safety of other employees, and that the fantasies related by Stone seemed to tally with the nature of the attacks on the Russells. Stone had told a psychiatric nurse that he dreamt about torturing people and that he fantasised about killing children and running about in woods. He further added that he felt like killing children while walking in woods and that when he passed by children he felt like killing them, and also claimed to have attacked people with hammers. He had also said that he was angry at the world and was going to do \"something bad\". Stone had also apparently begged to be admitted as an in-patient to a psychiatric unit at the time, but he was refused as he was seen as \"too dangerous\". In his outbursts to medical staff, Stone had asserted his own dangerousness, saying he was too violent to be held in prison and would need to be admitted to Broadmoor Hospital, with notions of achieving \"fame and glory\" for his crimes.
