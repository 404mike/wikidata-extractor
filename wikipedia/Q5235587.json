His VC citation stated: \"He personally was largely responsible for the holding of this important bridgehead over the River Orne and for the repulse of seven German counter-attacks with great loss to the enemy.\" The Norfolks, who bore the brunt of the fighting, lost 226 men.

Despite heavy German fire, Freeland constantly moved around the battlefield to encourage his forward companies, and find the moment to launch his own offensive. Around the same time Captain David Jamieson of Freeland's battalion was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

The operation, which failed and cost the 59th Division further casualties, was intended to divert German attention away from Operation Goodwood, the British attempt to break out of the Normandy beachhead. The division again joined XII Corps and, after the Americans launched Operation Cobra, XXX Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks after Bucknall was sacked, launched Operation Bluecoat and the Germans began withdrawing to Falaise.
