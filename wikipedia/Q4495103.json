'Housman, A(lfred) E(dward)', in Grove Music Online (2001) In 1904 the cycle A Shropshire Lad was set by Arthur Somervell, who in 1898 had begun to develop the concept of the English song-cycle in his version of Tennyson's \"Maud\".'Two Song Cycles by Arthur Somervell' in Opera Today, 2 June 2020 Stephen Banfield believes it was acquaintance with Somervell's cycle that led other composers to set Housman: Ralph Vaughan Williams is likely to have attended the first performance at the Aeolian Hall on 3 February 1905.Banfield, Stephen.

He is credited  with the description of harpsichord music as sounding like \"a toasting fork on a birdcage\"; when describing Handel and Bach, he said that \"Handel was the more elegant composer, but Bach was the more thorough\". Scholes led the public denunciations of Arthur Eaglefield Hull when it was found that his book Music: Classical, Romantic and Modern (1927) was found to have borrowed material from other writers. How much of this was plagiarism and how much a mere careless, hasty failure to cite sources is not known, but the scandal left Hull very upset.
