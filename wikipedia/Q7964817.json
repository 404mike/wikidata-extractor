The cemetery was laid out in 1881 and primarily contains late 19th century and early 20th century burials, including over 120 war graves of Armed Forces personnel. Graves include Charles Thomas Kennedy and James Davis, both recipients of the Victoria Cross, and footballers Walter Fairgrieve, Bobby Walker and Alex Walker. The cemetery was under private ownership until the early 1990s when it was acquired by the council due to safety concerns over its neglected state. It was originally built to ease overcrowding at the nearby Dalry cemetery."]}, {"page": "1898\u201399 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["| Walter Fairgrieve"]}, {"page": "1899\u20131900 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["|Walter Fairgrieve"]}, {"page": "Fairgrieve", "response": ["*Walter Fairgrieve (1874\u20131915), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
