He is the younger brother of Danny McGrain, one of Celtic's most lauded players.\nMcGrain was initially signed up on an 'S' form by Celtic. After a couple of seasons on loan in the Junior ranks with Maryhill (where Danny had also played) and Duntocher Hibs, he was released by Celtic and signed for Partick Thistle, managed by former Hoops star Bertie Auld. He was also unable to break into the first team at the Jags and moved to the Republic of Ireland, initially to Galway Rovers where another former Celtic man Tommy Callaghan had become player-manager.In 1979, McGrain returned to Scotland and joined Dumbarton, playing for two seasons in the Scottish First Division. In 1980, he scored league goals against Heart of Midlothian and St Johnstone. In 1981, he left the Sons and reverted to the Junior grade with Pollok.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McGrain", "response": ["*Tommy McGrain (born 1959), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Tommy McGrain"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Tommy McGrain"]}, {"page": "List of foreign League of Ireland players", "response": ["* Tommy McGrain \u2013 Galway Rovers, Sligo Rovers"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["* Danny McGrain, Tommy McGrain (brother)"]}]}}
