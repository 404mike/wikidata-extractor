The British, however, were less fortunate on 5 December, when the bomb vessel  was wrecked on Anholt Reef while caught in the ice. The reason that the vessel sank in that area was because the Danes had closed the lighthouse on the island of Anholt, in the Kattegat early during the war, and the Admiralty had ordered her to station herself off the island on 9 November to carry a light for the safety of passing convoys. All her crew was however saved."]}, {"page": "HMS Minotaur (1793)", "response": ["Whilst sailing from Gothenburg to Britain, under the command of John Barrett, Minotaur in darkness and heavy weather struck the Haak Bank, or Razende Bol, on the Texel off the Netherlands, then part of the First French Empire, in the evening of 22 December 1810, after becoming separated from her consorts, HMS  and Loire. Minotaur got stuck in the sand, rolled on her side and quickly made water. It was decided to cut all the masts to lighten the ship; this destroyed some of the boats. By the early morning, the ship had nevertheless sunk deeper, flooding the forecastle. Waves pounded the hull. Around 08:00, the hull split asunder. The crew, taking refuge on the poop deck, tried to evacuate on a remaining launch and two yauls. Thirty-two men escaped on a yaul. When they reached the Dutch coast, this inspired another eighty-five to use the launch; they too reached the shore. Captain Barrett, together with about a hundred men, then tried to escape with the remaining yaul but it was swamped and all drowned. Around 14:00, the Minotaur turned completely, drowning the remaining crew. The 110 of her crew that had taken to her boats informed the Dutch authorities of the disaster. Another twenty survivors were rescued by a pilot vessel.Kroniek der Zeemacht, HMS Minotaur. The authorities placed the survivors under custody and refused to dispatch more rescue vessels until the following morning. The rescue party found however that apart from four men who had reached shore by clinging to wreckage, no survivors remained on the vessel or in the surrounding water. The death toll therefore was between 370 and 570 men.Ships of the Old Navy, Minotaur. All survivors were taken to France as prisoners of war."]}, {"page": "John Barrett", "response": ["John Barrett may refer to:", "* John Barrett (Irish soldier) (died 1693), Irish colonel in the Williamite war", "* John Barrett (Royal Navy officer) (died 1810), Irish captain in the Royal Navy", "* John Barrett (Australian politician) (1858\u20131928), Australian senator", "* John Barrett (Scottish politician) (born 1954), Scottish Liberal Democrat politician and the former Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West", "* John Barrett (diplomat) (1866\u20131938), United States ambassador to Siam, Argentina, Panama, and Colombia", "* John Barrett (Massachusetts politician) (born 1947), American legislator and former mayor of North Adams", "* John Barrett (Missouri politician) (1915\u20132000), American legislator", "* John Barrett (bishop) (1878\u20131946), British clergyman who held high office in the Roman Catholic Church", "* John Barrett (Dean of Clonmacnoise) (1929\u20131996), Irish Anglican priest", "* John Barrett (Hebrew scholar) (1753\u20131821), Irish Anglican priest", "* John Barrett (athlete) (born 1879), Irish track and field athlete", "* John Barrett (American football) (1899\u20131966), American football player", "* John Barrett (Australian footballer) (born 1928), Australian rules footballer", "* John Barrett (ice hockey) (born 1958), Canadian NHL defenseman", "* John Barrett (cricketer) (born 1946), English cricketer", "* John Barrett (outfielder) ( 1872), American baseball outfielder", "* John Barrett (tennis) (born 1931), English tennis player and commentator", "* John Barrett (volleyball) (born 1962), Canadian volleyball player", "* John Barrett (actor) (1910\u20131983), British actor", "* John Barrett (conservationist) (1913\u20131999), British conservationist, author and broadcaster", "* John Barrett (salon), the brand of beauty and hair salons by hairstylist John Barrett", "* John Barrett (academic), British energy and climate change scientist", "* John Barrett, frontman of the band Bass Drum of Death", "* John Barrett Kerfoot (1816\u20131881), American bishop"]}, {"page": "John Barrett (d.1810)", "response": ["#Redirect John Barrett (Royal Navy officer)"]}]}}
