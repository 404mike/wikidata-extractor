Smethurst's undisputed Norfolk accent is well known from his releases of the 1960s, such as \"Hev Yew Gotta Loight Bor?\". The Boy John Letters of Sidney Grapes, which were originally published in the Eastern Daily Press, are another valid example of the Norfolk dialect. Beyond simply portrayers of speech and idiom however, Smethurst, and more especially Grapes, record their authentic understanding of mid-twentieth-century Norfolk village life. Grapes' characters, the Boy John, Aunt Agatha, Granfar, and Ole Missus W, perform a literary operetta celebrating down-to-earth ordinariness over bourgeois affectation and pretence; their values and enduring habits instantly familiar to Norfolk people.", "* Singing Postman \u2013 aka Allan Smethurst"]}, {"page": "2000 in British music", "response": ["*24 December \u2013 Allan Smethurst (\"The Singing Postman\"), 73"]}, {"page": "Paston College", "response": ["* Allan Smethurst, The Singing Postman"]}, {"page": "Late Night Line-Up", "response": ["*Ken Dodd / Allan Smethurst And Cluff's Dog 14 May 1965"]}, {"page": "Mind how you go", "response": ["*\"Mind How You Go\", a 1967 single by Allan Smethurst"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2000", "response": ["*Allan Smethurst, 73, English folk singer, heart attack."]}, {"page": "Rolf Harris discography", "response": ["|\"Hey Yew Gotta Loight, Boy?\" (Allan Smethurst)"]}, {"page": "Smethurst", "response": ["*Allan Smethurst (1927\u20132000), aka The Singing Postman, English folk singer and postman"]}]}}
