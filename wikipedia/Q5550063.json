For Loughlin, the city dwellers are prisoners who do not realize they are in a prison. John Murdoch's escape from the prison parallels the escape from the cave in the allegory. He is assisted by Dr. Schreber, who explains the city's mechanism as Socrates explains to Glaucon how the shadows in the cave are cast. Murdoch however becomes more than Glaucon; Loughlin writes, \"He is a Glaucon who comes to realize that Socrates' tale of an upper, more real world, is itself a shadow, a forgery.\" Murdoch defeats the Strangers who control the inhabitants and remakes the world based on childhood memories, which were themselves illusions arranged by the Strangers. Loughlin writes of the lack of background, \"The origin of the city is off-stage, unknown and unknowable.\" Murdoch now casts new shadows for the city inhabitants, who must trust his judgment. Unlike Plato, Murdoch \"is disabused of any hope of an outside\" and becomes the demiurge for the cave, the only environment he knows."]}, {"page": "Interpretations of 2001: A Space Odyssey", "response": ["Gerard Loughlin claimed in a 2003 book that the monolith is Kubrick's representation of the cinema screen itself: \"it is a cinematic conceit, for turn the monolith on its side and one has the letterbox of the cinemascope screen, the blank rectangle on which the star-child appears, as does the entirety of Kubrick\u2019s film.\"Gerard Loughlin p73 \"Alien Sex: The Body and Desire in Cinema and Theology\" (first edition 2003 Oxford: Blackwell.
