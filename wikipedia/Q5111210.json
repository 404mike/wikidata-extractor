Cocker later gave a speech in April 2018 at a protest in Sheffield City Hall, speaking out in support of the tree campaigners in Sheffield. Environmentalist Rob McBride, (aka the tree hunter), instigated a successful, high-profile contest. The Great Trees of Sheffield was launched in January 2017 to help raise awareness of the street tree situation and campaigns. Judges featured, Jarvis Cocker, Richard Hawley, Chris Packham, Nick Clegg, Patrick Barkham and Christine Walkden."]}]}}
