When he was about eight, the family moved to Holyhead, and his first school was at Beaumaris in Anglesey. He was later educated at Coventry, and the Gymnase, Strasbourg.  He returned at the age of sixteen with the intention of becoming a civil engineer. (His younger brother James would in fact become a noted engineer, helping complete the Buenos Aires harbour works in the 1880s and 1890s.) At the beginning of his career, he continued to study at the South Kensington School of Art, in his spare time, but without definite ambition. In December 1856 he entered the Board of Trade, gradually rising to the rank of principal in the harbour department, from which he retired in the autumn of 1901. In 1868, he had married Frances Mary, daughter of the distinguished civil engineer Nathaniel Beardmore (1816\u20131872) of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, and settled at Ealing. Dobson died in 1921 and his funeral was held on 6 September at St Peter's Church, Ealing.odnb2.ifactory.com/view/article/32845/32845?docPos=33 He is buried in the Westminster Cemetery, Uxbridge Road, Hanwell, Middlesex."]}, {"page": "Limehouse Cut", "response": ["At the northern end of the Cut was a conflict with a property called Four Mills: in fact, a group of five tidal water wheels.The Four Mills were about half a mile downstream the still-surviving Three Mills: }  Nathaniel Beardmore, the Lee trustees' engineer, described the conflict as it was in early Victorian times: At an 1850 inquiry by William Cubitt it was explained that because the Cut was unnavigable for four or five days at neap tides, barges had no way out to the Thames except via Bow Creek (which was toll free).  Hence the tolls were lost.", "Rendel's plans were implemented by his former pupil Nathaniel Beardmore.   The first tranche of work was supposed to comprise the tidal portion (from the Thames to Old Ford), hence the Limehouse Cut.  However funds ran out, work stopped in 1853,;  and some of Rendel's plans had to be curtailed.  When more funding became available in 1855 it had to be devoted to non-tidal parts of the Lee.As required by the 1855 Act: ."]}, {"page": "Royal Meteorological Society", "response": ["* 1861\u20131862: Nathaniel Beardmore"]}, {"page": "James Meadows Rendel (engineer)", "response": ["He soon entered into partnership at Plymouth with Nathaniel Beardmore, and his practice rapidly grew. In 1826 he erected Bowcombe Bridge, near Kingsbridge, Devon, when hydraulic power was first applied to the machinery for making swing bridges. In 1831 he introduced a new system of crossing rivers by means of chain ferries worked by steam, and in 1832 he constructed a floating bridge on this principle, crossing the Dart at Dartmouth. Between 1832 and 1834 similar floating bridges were erected at Torpoint and Saltash across the Tamar, which greatly facilitated the intercourse between Devon and Cornwall. For these achievements a second Telford medal was awarded to Rendel in 1838. The Torpoint Ferry still operates, albeit much updated. A similar floating bridge was implemented as the Woolston ferry between Woolston, Hampshire and Southampton in 1836."]}, {"page": "Beardmore", "response": ["*Nathaniel Beardmore (1816-1872), British engineer and hydrologist"]}, {"page": "Telford Medal", "response": ["| rowspan=\"5\" |1853-1854 || Nathaniel Beardmore || || 'Description of the Navigation and Drainage Works, recently executed on the Tidal portion of the River Lea'"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh Water Company", "response": ["Two other engineers, James Rendel and Nathaniel Beardmore worked on the proposals, and the setting out of the works once the Act was obtained, but it was Leslie who supervised the construction. The northern reservoirs were constructed with earth dams, with a 3 to 1 slope on the upstream side of the central clay puddle wall, and a 2.5 to 1 slope on the downstream side. The outlet arrangements for Torduff and Loganlea were similar to those at Harlaw, with two outlets, although the bottom outlets fed into tunnels cut through solid rock, but at Clubbiedean, the outlet was a single cast iron pipe buried beneath the dam. Leslie's regime of compacting thin layers worked well, and it was not until the 1970s that some remedial work was required at Clubbiedean to grout the embankment and foundations, as the underlying limestone had gradually dissolved, creating some leakage through the dam. Remedial work was also required at Torduff after some leakage was discovered in the 1980s."]}, {"page": "Glasgow Corporation Water Works", "response": ["The first was a scheme to exploit the waters of Loch Lubnaig, in the River Callender catchment, some  to the north of Glasgow. This was abandoned when it was discovered that more compensation water would be required than the loch could hold. The neighbouring Loch Katrine was also considered, but was not pursued at that time. The engineer Nathaniel Beardmore moved to London in 1843, where he collaborated with James Meadows Rendel on a project for the Glasgow Gravitation Water Company. The scheme was for a reservoir at Gilmerston, in the valley of the River Avon, and a  aqueduct to transport the water to Glasgow. Some work was carried out in 1844, but the project was abandoned in early 1845."]}]}}
