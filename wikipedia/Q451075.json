Formed in 1998, the band is composed of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. They were a leading group of the early-2000s indie rock revival.", "Lead singer-songwriter Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti started playing together as teenagers while attending Dwight School in Manhattan, and formed an informal band in 1997. They later added bassist Nikolai Fraiture to their ranks, a close childhood friend of Casablancas who had attended the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York with him. At the end of 1998, the group invited guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. to play with them. He had just moved to New York City and reconnected with Casablancas, whom he knew from their brief stints at the private boarding school Institut Le Rosey, near Nyon, Switzerland. The two soon became roommates.", "The Strokes frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi started writing material for the album in January 2009, intent on entering the studio that February. Julian commented in Rolling Stone that they had completed about three songs that sounded like a mixture of 1970s rock and \"music from the future\". On March 31, 2009, from their MySpace account, the band announced the end of their \"much needed hibernation period\" and the commencement of new writing and rehearsing for a fourth full-length album, entitled Angles. This album would be different from the first three in that it would feature music written by the other four Strokes, rather than Casablancas writing ninety-five percent of the material again: \"It's supercollaborative, and it sounds different,\" said Valensi, \"but it has a Strokes vibe to it.\"Scaggs, A.

In an NME article, Pharrell Williams expressed interest in producing this upcoming album. This followed the news that Casablancas had collaborated with Williams and Santigold on \"My Drive Thru\", a track commemorating the 100th anniversary of Converse's Chuck Taylor All-Stars shoe. The song was available as a free download from the official Converse site. The album was due to be released in late 2009, but disagreements about the songs' readiness forced the Strokes to scale back this date. On February 1, 2010, the Strokes announced on their website that the recording of the fourth album was being helmed by award-winning producer Joe Chiccarelli. According to Chiccarelli in an interview with HitQuarters, the two camps first met in 2009 and, after finding they shared a similar mind space and similar thoughts on the potential direction of the new record, tried out some tracking.  Not long after recording began, however, the band became frustrated with Chiccarelli's reserved production style.  Only one song from these recording sessions, \"Life Is Simple in the Moonlight\", remained on the album's track listing.  Inspired, in part, by bands like MGMT, Arctic Monkeys, and Crystal Castles, the Strokes decided to experiment with various production techniques, and recorded the rest of the album's material at Albert Hammond, Jr.'s home studio in upstate New York with award-winning engineer Gus Oberg.", "In October 2016, guitarist Valensi indicated that the band were \"slowly but surely working on an album, we\u2019re kind of just in writing sessions\".

Albert Hammond Jr. took to Twitter to clarify that \u201cwe met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all.\u201d He also tweeted, \"Sorry everyone we are not in the studio recording\" and that there were \"a lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time.\"", "* Albert Hammond Jr. \u2013 rhythm and lead guitar (1998\u2013present); keyboards, backing vocals (2010\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "List of one-hit wonders in the United States", "response": ["Disc jockey and music writer Brent Mann points out how some artists have been called a \"one-hit wonder\" despite having other charting singles; in these cases, one signature song so overshadows the rest of the artist's discography that only that song remains familiar to later audiences.

In another case, Scottish rockers Simple Minds followed their big hit \"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" (appearing in the opening and closing scenes of the film The Breakfast Club) with \"Alive and Kicking\" which peaked at number 3 in the US, \"Sanctify Yourself\" which peaked at number 14 in the US, and \"All the Things She Said\" which peaked at number 28 in the US, yet the band is remembered primarily for the first song."]}, {"page": "1972 in music", "response": ["*It Never Rains in Southern California \u2013 Albert Hammond"]}, {"page": "1984 in music", "response": ["* \"To All the Girls I've Loved Before\" w.
