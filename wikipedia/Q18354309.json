He supported the programme of Independent sector treatment centres, which a number of other Provider Chief Executives said was unnecessary, on the grounds that it was necessary to increase local choice. Debbie Abrahams who was chair of the PCT at the time resigned while he was there over the use of private health companies in the NHS, which she said were 'destroying the NHS.'  Mr Purt expressed disappointment but said \"as an organisation, (the PCT is) fully committed to ensuring patients receive the best possible care when it is needed and where it is wanted\".He was the first Chief Executive of Hywel Dda University Health Board, appointed in 2009. His move from England was reported to have boosted self-confidence of healthcare managers in Wales. He was involved in controversial but subsequently successful service changes which resulted in the closure of the Special Care baby Unit at Withybush Hospital and removal of consultant led maternity services & paediatrics.  He was the subject of criticism in 2013 because he did not sign a letter he sent regretting the death of a patient himself.He was awarded the title of Professor of Practice Health Management in 2012 by Trinity St David University \u201cfor his work in health management\u201d.In late June 2014 he took over as CEO of the troubled Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board following highly critical Public Accounts Committee and Welsh Audit office reports, both of which highlighted major legacy issues from previous board and management failures.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glan Clwyd Hospital", "response": ["A report by Donna Ockenden claiming \u201cinstitutionalised abuse\u201d at the Tawel Fan psychiatric ward at the Ablett Unit was published in May 2015.

As a result, seven employees were referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council and three to the General Medical Council.
