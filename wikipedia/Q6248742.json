He made his debut for the first team in their final match in the English First Division, although he was to wait a further two years for his next appearance. In all Milkins was to make over 300 appearances for Portsmouth  and was to prove such a popular player that in 1970 he was awarded the inaugural Player of the Year trophy. The following year he was awarded a testimonial against local rivals Southampton which resulted in a 0\u20137 defeat. In the 1974 close season he was sold to Oxford United for whom he played sporadically until his last league appearance in May 1979. He then joined now defunct Southern League club Waterlooville and, after two years as first-choice goalkeeper, became player-manager during the 1981\u201382 season, taking over from John Waugh. At the end of that season he retired from playing but continued as first-team manager until December 1983. During his two years as manager of Waterlooville the club were promoted to the Premier Division, reached the final of the Southern League Cup, and reached the first round proper of the F.A. Cup where they played against league opposition for the only time in their history, losing to Northampton Town after two replays. After being replaced as Waterlooville manager by Ernie Bradwell part-way through the 1983\u201384 season, Milkins then ran a sports shop/ snooker hall consortium. Milkins has a daughter, Julie, and a son, David, who was also an accomplished footballer, playing as a forward for Waterlooville in the 1980s and 1990s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portsmouth F.C.", "response": ["* 1969 \u2013  John Milkins", "|align=\"left\"|John Milkins||||GK||1961\u201374||\u2014||389||0"]}]}}
