He was then accepted by Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours in English. Having only developed a passion for theatre in his late teens, Mendes became a member of the Marlowe Society at Cambridge and directed several plays. His first play was David Halliwell's Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs, and one of his later productions was Cyrano de Bergerac with Tom Hollander and Jonathan Cake among the cast members. During his time at Cambridge, Mendes also became enthusiastic towards cinema in earnest. He cited Paris, Texas, Repo Man and True Stories as three \"seminal film moments\" that influenced his stage and film career."]}, {"page": "Mike Leigh", "response": ["Leigh responded negatively to RADA's agenda, found himself being taught how to \"laugh, cry and snog\" for weekly rep purposes and so became a sullen student. He later attended Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts (in 1963), the Central School of Art and Design and the London School of Film Technique on Charlotte Street. When he had arrived in London, one of the first films he had seen was Shadows (1959), an improvised film by John Cassavetes, in which a cast of unknowns was observed 'living, loving and bickering' on the streets of New York and Leigh had \"felt it might be possible to create complete plays from scratch with a group of actors.\" Other influences from this time included Harold Pinter's The Caretaker\u2014\"Leigh was mesmerised by the play and the (Arts Theatre) production\"\u2014 Samuel Beckett, whose novels he read avidly, and the writing of Flann O'Brien, whose \"tragi-comedy\" Leigh found particularly appealing. Influential and important productions he saw in this period included Beckett's Endgame, Peter Brook's King Lear and in 1965 Peter Weiss's Marat/Sade, a production developed through improvisations, the actors having based their characterisations on people they had visited in a mental hospital. The visual worlds of Ronald Searle,Marlow meets Mike Leigh, Sky Arts George Grosz, Picasso, and William Hogarth exerted another kind of influence. He played small roles in several British films in the early 1960s, (West 11, Two Left Feet) and played a young deaf-mute, interrogated by Rupert Davies, in the BBC Television series Maigret. In 1964\u201365, he collaborated with David Halliwell, and designed and directed the first production of Little Malcolm and his Struggle Against the Eunuchs at the Unity Theatre."]}, {"page": "Terror of the Vervoids", "response": ["This story segment of Trial went through a number of commissions with writers including David Halliwell & Jack Trevor Story (working on separate but linked episodes), Christopher H. Bidmead and Peter J. Hammond, the creator of the cult science-fiction fantasy series Sapphire & Steel. Hammond's story outline, titled Paradise Five, was liked by script editor Eric Saward but disliked by producer John Nathan-Turner, who rejected it and commissioned Pip and Jane Baker to do the segment instead. Nathan-Turner also was displeased with the appearance of the Vervoids, likening them to labia.
