He enters the historical record by playing Porrex in the c. 1591 production of the play The Seven Deadly Sins (likely written by Richard Tarleton), along with Augustine Phillips, Thomas Pope, Richard Cowley, and George Bryan, all future colleagues in the Lord Chamberlain's Men. (That production was performed by a combination of personnel from the Lord Strange's Men and the Admiral's Men.) He is generally thought to have been with the Lord Chamberlain's Men at their re-formed start in 1594, probably at first as a hired man; he may have become a sharer in the company when George Bryan retired, c. 1597, though this is uncertain.\nSly is mentioned in Henslowe's diary between October 1594 and January 1595. He bought a jewel in a white setting from Henslowe and was paying him back in installments during this period. Henslowe recorded 8 separate repayments made by Sly.\nSly is included in the troupe's surviving cast lists for the next few years, for Every Man in His Humour (1598), Every Man Out of His Humour (1599), and Sejanus (1603) \u2014 all three by Ben Jonson. When the Lord Chamberlain's Men became the King's Men in May 1603, Sly was one of the sharers. He, along with a few other of the King's Men including Burbage, played himself in the brief Induction to Marston's The Malcontent, as indicated by the published version of the play.  This scene showed him quoting one of Osric's lines in Hamlet, suggesting that he played that character.\nIn 1605 Sly became a shareholder in the Globe Theatre; in the same year he was one of the executors of Augustine Phillips's will. He was also one of the shareholders in the Blackfriars Theatre when the King's Men took it over in August 1608, but died soon after, his potential portion being divided among the other sharers. On 16 August 1608 he was buried in St. Leonard's Church in Shoreditch.\nIn his last will and testament, Sly left his share in the Globe to fellow actor Robert Browne; he left a large sum, \u00a340, to a James Saunder or Sands, who might have been a boy player in The Seven Deadly Sins nearly two decades before. And he left his sword and hat to Cuthbert Burbage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "English Renaissance theatre", "response": ["*William Sly"]}, {"page": "1603 in literature", "response": ["*May 19 \u2013 The London acting company previously known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men comes under the patronage of the new monarch and is chartered as the King's Men.

William Sly, who performed occasionally with the Admiral's Men during the 1590s, acted for the Chamberlain's by 1598, and perhaps before; he became a sharer after Phillips's death in 1605. Richard Cowley, identified as Verges by the quarto of Much Ado About Nothing, became a sharer in the King's Men. Nicholas Tooley, at one point apprenticed to Burbage, stayed with the company until his death in 1623. John Sincler (or Sincklo) may have specialised in playing thin characters; he seems to have remained a hired man. John Duke was a hired man who went to Worcester's Men early in James's reign."]}, {"page": "Blackfriars Theatre", "response": ["In the years around the turn of the century, the children's companies were something of a phenomenon; a reference in Hamlet to \"little eyasses\" suggests that even the adult companies felt threatened by them. By the later half of that decade, the fashion had changed somewhat. In 1608, Burbage's company (by this time, the King's Men) took possession of the theatre, which they still owned, this time without objections from the neighbourhood. There were originally seven sharers in the reorganised theatre: Richard Burbage, William Shakespeare, Henry Condell, John Heminges, and William Sly, all members of the King's Men, plus Cuthbert Burbage and Thomas Evans, agent for the theatre manager Henry Evans. This arrangement of shareholders (or \"housekeepers) was similar to how the Globe Theatre was operated. Sly, however, died soon after the arrangement was made, and his share was divided among the other six."]}, {"page": "Sejanus His Fall", "response": ["The published cast list in Jonson's 1616 folio identifies the principal actors as Richard Burbage, Augustine Phillips, William Sly, John Lowin, William Shakespeare, John Heminges, Henry Condell, and Alexander Cooke (listed in that order). It is not known which parts were played by which actors. David Grote argues that the published list probably mixes two separate productions, as Lowin did not join the King's Men until after the first production. However Grote suggests that the most likely roles for these performers can be identified:", "Sejanus, the largest role and a classic over-reacher in the Richard III manner, was obviously played by Burbage. The proud Silius, whose confrontation with Tiberius occupies the core of the first three acts and whose suicide is a traditionally noble Roman death, most likely would have gone to Heminges, with the more military Condell as the Guards Captain Macro. Phillips, who had been playing dissolute men for some time, would seem very likely for Tiberius if not for Jonson's hint that it was actually Shakespeare. Still, with Shakespeare as Tiberius, there is a very large role for an indignant speechmaker, Arruntius, that would have taken advantage of Phillips's rhetorical skills.David Grote, The Best Actors in the World: Shakespeare and His Acting Company, Greenwood Press, Westport, 2002, p. 121.
