Main Swete Alexander Walrond. He was educated at Royal Naval College, Osborne, Isle of Wight, and at Royal Naval College, DartmouthHe was serving as a midshipman aboard HMS Aboukir when, on the morning of 22 September 1914, HMS Aboukir, HMS Hogue and HMS Cressy, three armoured cruisers, were on patrol in the Broad Fourteens off the Dutch coast. They were attacked by the German U-Boat U-9, which was under the command of Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Otto Weddigen. Wykeham-Musgrave's daughter, Pru Bailey-Hamilton, recounted the tale of his torpedoing during a BBC interview in  2003:\n\"He went overboard when the Aboukir was going down and he swam like mad to  get away from the suction. He was then just getting on board the Hogue and she was torpedoed. He then went and swam to the Cressy and she was  also torpedoed. He eventually found a bit of driftwood, became  unconscious and was eventually picked up by a Dutch trawler.\"\nThe  U-Boat torpedoed all three ships within the space of an hour. Wykeham-Musgrave survived the war and re-joined the Royal Navy in 1939, reaching the rank of  commander.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Violet Jessop", "response": ["* Wenman Wykeham-Musgrave, a British sailor who survived three consecutive sinkings in the action of 22 September 1914."]}, {"page": "Barford, Warwickshire", "response": ["* Wenman Wykeham-Musgrave (1899\u20131989), a Royal Navy officer who survived being torpedoed on three different ships on the same day in the action of 22 September 1914."]}, {"page": "Wykham-Musgrave", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wenman Wykeham-Musgrave"]}]}}
