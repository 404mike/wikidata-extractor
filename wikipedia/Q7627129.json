Historic Royal Palaces Agency became an independent charity in 1998 called Historic Royal Palaces (HRP). HRP receives no public or crown funds and is therefore dependent on charitable giving for management of the site. Under HRP the Kensington Palace State Rooms underwent a two-year, \u00a312 million renovation, underwritten with contributions from the Heritage Lottery Fund as well as other public and private donations. New uniforms for staff were designed by Stuart Stockdale at Jaeger. The re-opening of the palace occurred in time for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2012. Visitors now can choose four different routes throughout the palace that offer exhibits incorporating cutting-edge digital presentations, interactive experiences, and even audio sequences that bring to life the gatherings of gowns, antique furniture, and other memorabilia of notable residents of the palace including William and Mary in the Queen's State Apartments, the court of George I and II in the King's State Apartments and the life of Queen Victoria in the rooms most associated with her.  The fourth exhibit displays selections of Queen Elizabeth's wardrobe in the 1950s, Princess Margaret from the 1960 and 70s and Diana, Princess of Wales in the 1980s during their fashion heyday. The grounds of the palace were also renovated with enhancements including eliminating railings, fences, and shrubs that had undermined royal gardener Charles Bridgeman's original landscaping. Two new public gardens to the south and east of the palace were installed that connect the property to Kensington Gardens."]}, {"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* Stuart Stockdale"]}, {"page": "Stockdale", "response": ["*Stuart Stockdale, English fashion designer, former head of design at Pringle of Scotland"]}, {"page": "Jaeger (clothing)", "response": ["In 2004, Belinda Earl, formerly of Debenhams, was employed as CEO.

Its appearance at 2008 London Fashion Week, for the first time in its history also appeared to mark a stronger brand image. As of 2011, Jaeger had 45 UK stores and shipped to 38 countries worldwide.
