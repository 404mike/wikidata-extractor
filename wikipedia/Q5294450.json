He was a member of the Manitoba Provincial Legislative Council (which he helped to abolish). \nGunn was born in Halkirk, Caithness, Scotland, in 1797.  His father was William Gunn in Braehour who was brother to Donald Gunn the sennachie in Braehour of Brawlbin who married Catherine Gunn in Osclay. She was the great granddaughter of Donald Crotach Gunn who was Chief of the Clan Gunn. Donald (Manitoba) Gunn married Margaret Swain (who was born in Rupertsland, Manitoba) in 1819; they had many children. Donald had a brother called William Gunn of Waranga, Victoria, Australia.\nDonald worked in the Canadian North West for the Hudson's Bay Company between 1813 and 1823, and was subsequently a Judge on the Court of Petty Sessions in Red River.  He also wrote for the Smithsonian Institution and the Institute of Rupert's Land, and was a member of the Board of Management for Manitoba College (a Presbyterian institution).\nGunn was one of the earliest contributors to the Smithsonian Institution in the field of astronomy.\nGunn was a supporter of Canadian Confederation and the Government of Adams George Archibald.  In Manitoba's first general election (27 December 1870), he ran against Provincial Secretary and fellow Archibald-supporter Alfred Boyd.  He was defeated by 58 votes to 28.\nGunn was appointed to the Province's new Legislative Council on 15 March 1871, one of seven members.  In 1876, he supported the decision of the Robert A. Davis government to abolish the institution.\nDonald Gunn died in 1878 in St. Andrew's, Manitoba.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Boyd", "response": ["With the end of the rebellion and the subsequent incorporation of Manitoba as a Canadian province (July 15, 1870), Lt. Governor Adams George Archibald (1870\u20131872) named Boyd as his Provincial Secretary.  Archibald considered Boyd to be acceptable to the French population of the province, as well as to its English-speaking \"mixed-blood\" Anglo-Metis residents (i.e. persons of British and aboriginal descent).  Boyd was elected for the riding of St. Andrew's North in Manitoba's first provincial election (December 27, 1870), defeating fellow government-supporter Donald Gunn by 58 votes to 28."]}, {"page": "John Norquay", "response": ["It may be added that Norquay's career was relatively free of racial prejudice. He was the victim of some racial slurs (Legislative Councilor Donald Gunn once referred to him as \"Greasy John\"), but his longevity in office suggests that Manitobans were willing to accept an aboriginal Premier, despite the tensions caused by Louis Riel's rebellions.
