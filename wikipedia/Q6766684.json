I snorted my father. He was cremated and I couldn't resist grinding him up with a little bit of blow. My dad wouldn't have cared ... It went down pretty well, and I'm still alive.\" In the media uproar that followed, Richards's manager said that the anecdote had been meant as a joke; Beaumont told Uncut magazine that the interview had been conducted by international telephone and that he had misquoted Richards at one point (reporting that Richards had said he listens to Mot\u00f6rhead, when what he had said was Mozart), but that he believed the ash-snorting anecdote was true. Musician Jay Farrar from the band Son Volt wrote a song titled 'Cocaine And Ashes', which was inspired by Richards's drug habits. The incident was also referenced in the 2017 song \"Mr Charisma\" by The Waterboys, featuring the lyrics: \"Hey Mr Charisma, what will your next trick be? Slagging Sgt Pepper, snorting your old man's bones, or falling out of a tree?\""]}, {"page": "Kid A", "response": ["Several critics felt Kid A was pretentious or deliberately obscure. The Irish Times bemoaned the lack of conventional song structures and panned the album as \"deliberately abstruse, wilfully esoteric and wantonly unfathomable ... The only thing challenging about Kid A is the very real challenge to your attention span.\" In the New Yorker, novelist Nick Hornby wrote that it was \"morbid proof that this sort of self-indulgence results in a weird kind of anonymity rather than something distinctive and original\". Melody Maker critic Mark Beaumont called it \"tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory, look-ma-I-can-suck-my-own-cock whiny old rubbish ... About 60 songs were started that no one had a bloody clue how to finish.\" Alexis Petridis of the Guardian described it as \"self-consciously awkward and bloody-minded, the noise made by a band trying so hard to make a 'difficult' album that they felt it beneath them to write any songs\". Rolling Stone published a piece by Michael Krugman and Jason Cohen mocking Kid A as humourless, derivative and lacking in songs; they wrote: \"Because it was decided that Radiohead were Important and Significant last time around, no one can accept the album as the crackpot art project it so obviously is.\""]}, {"page": "Muse (band)", "response": ["In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local battle of the bands, smashing their equipment in the process. Bellamy said, \"It was supposed to be a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously.\" The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth. The band liked that the new name was short and thought that it looked good on a poster. According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect \"the sense Matt had that he had somehow 'summoned up' this band, the way mediums could summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need\".Mark Beaumont (2010). \"Out of This World: The Story of Muse\".

This placed it sixth in the list of best-selling albums in the US. Worldwide, it went on to sell 50 million copies, leading NME journalist Mark Beaumont to call it \"the biggest selling hard rock album ever made\"; rock historian Brock Helander said it was possibly \"the best-selling heavy-metal album in history\"."]}, {"page": "GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)", "response": ["In a retrospective analysis, Nintendo Life editor Mark Reece gave GoldenEye 007 a rating of 8 out of 10, stating that although the game's multiplayer mode stands up well, its graphics, audio and \"fiddly\" aiming system are dated. He noted that GoldenEye 007s approach to difficulty settings provides considerable replay value, but is a system rarely used in modern first-person shooters. Writing for NME on the game's 20th anniversary, journalist Mark Beaumont highlighted the game's immersive graphics, aesthetic, location-based damage on enemies, and revolutionary multiplayer mode, stating that it \"helped to introduce gaming as a group event\". In 2011, the game was selected as one of 80 games from the past 40 years to be placed in the Art of Video Games exhibit in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC."]}, {"page": "Pinkerton (album)", "response": ["Steve Appleford of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Pinkertons songs often \"are sloppy and awkward, but express a seemingly genuine, desperate search for sex and love\". Mark Beaumont of NME praised the album, writing that \"by the time the affecting acoustic lament 'Butterfly' wafts in like Big Star at a wildlife protection meeting, Pinkerton starts feeling like a truly moving album\". Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork wrote that \"Pinkerton might actually be a bit much for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys' debut, but if given a chance, it might surprise even some anti-Weezer folk.\" Guardian critic Kathy Sweeney found Pinkerton \"noisier and messier than their last album, and all the better for it\". In a positive review, Q wrote: \"On every tale of romance, delivered in perfect verse/chorus formula, you can see Jennifer Aniston giving it some attitude in the kitchen.\""]}, {"page": "Vanishing Point (Primal Scream album)", "response": ["Vanishing Point received positive reviews from critics, who welcomed it as a return to form after 1994's Give Out But Don't Give Up. NME named it the 4th best album of 1997. In 2012, NME journalist Mark Beaumont ranked it as the band's fourth best album, calling it \"a brilliant record for its statement of intent alone \u2013 it stamped in stone Primal Scream's mandate to never repeat themselves and consistently indulge their experimental spirit\". The album was also included in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die."]}, {"page": "Time (ELO album)", "response": ["Author Adam Roberts calls Time a \"future-set rock opera\". According to music journalist Mark Beaumont, it is a concept album about a man who is abducted forward in time to the year 2095, while the web publication Rockol and Stereo Review magazine both recognise Time as being about a man who becomes trapped in the future. The News & Advances Ben Cates says it \"tells the story of a man living in the year 2095 who glimpses enough of the future to know that he wants to get back to the 1980s\".", "The Quietus Joseph Stannard said that Time is a \"very good album indeed\", highlighting \"Twilight\" as \"the most exciting song ever recorded ... Pulsating, momentous, charged with purpose and overstuffed with hooks, counter-hooks, sub-hooks and semi-hooks, 'Twilight' makes being abducted by time travellers sound like the most fun you can have.\" Writing in The Guardian, Mark Beaumont listed \"Twilight\" as the 10th best song of ELO's career \"for its space-age cathedral sizzle, warp-speed pacing and the sort of brazen futuristic hooklines that proved they gave that Flash Gordon gig to the wrong band\"."]}, {"page": "The Remote Part", "response": ["In a review for NME, Mark Beaumont saw the album as a \"bold, bright, broken and bitter beast\" that showcases a band that \"burst out of their student-sheep\u2019s clothing and rip the throat out of Coldplay\". Rolling Stone reviewer Gaylord Fields said the band \"ratchet up the latent R.E.M.-isms, elevating themselves heads above their musical kin\". Pitchfork contributor Rob Mitchum saw the album's potential for \"alt-rock hits [...] where each and every song could be a single\". The Guardian music correspondent Dave Simpson noted that the album was \"musically anthemic but lyrically introspective\". Spin Andrew Beaujon wrote that the band were \"compelling when they put Woomble's sad-sack lyrics front and center,\" though on a few songs, their \"turgid squall swamps his words\"."]}, {"page": "Bummed", "response": ["Bummed appeared on album of the year lists by NME and Sounds, as well as appearing on best of decade lists by Q and Sounds. Spence said \"Wrote for Luck\" became the defining track of the acid house era. Scott Plagenhoef of Stylus considered the album \"the perfect summation of the 1988 British Summer of Love\". It was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In a piece for NME, journalist Mark Beaumont viewed the album as one of ten important releases that defined Factory Records' output."]}, {"page": "The National Anthem (Radiohead song)", "response": ["The song received polarised reviews from music critics. In his review of the album for the New Yorker, Nick Hornby mentioned the song as \"an unpleasant free-jazz workout, with a discordant horn section squalling over a studiedly crude bass line\". Mark Beaumont, who disparaged Kid A in Melody Maker on its release, wrote ten years later that the \"free-form jazz horns\" of \"The National Anthem\" produced a \"mingus-in-a-tumble-dryer racket\". Lorraine Ali, writing for Newsweek, described the song as \"annoying pileup of squawking instruments\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said the horn section \"was a cornier-than-usual art-rock clich\u00e9, trying way too hard for a way-too-obvious gimmick\"."]}, {"page": "Sci-Fi Lullabies", "response": ["The collection was widely praised by several notable music critics of the UK press. Mark Beaumont of NME said that while the second disc resembles a typical B-sides album, the first \"stakes a formidable claim as the fourth Suede album in its own right\" and is arguably superior to three acclaimed studio albums of the period: Radiohead's OK Computer, Spiritualized's Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space, and Suede's own Coming Up. John Harris of Select said the album plays like \"a retelling of the entire Suede movie script\" and is \"truly as good as most Greatest Hits albums.\" Writing for Vox, Simon Price felt that Anderson wrote some of his funniest lyrics on CD2, on the tracks \"Young Men\" and \"Jumble Sale Mums\". Aside from \"Duchess\", which he called \"lazy rubbish,\" he had strong praise for both discs."]}, {"page": "Warnings/Promises", "response": ["AllMusic reviewer John D. Luerssen said the album \"feels even more adventurous\" than their past albums \"this time out\". He added that the way the band have been operating \"may have kept them out of the limelight until now, but it's only a matter of time\" until they return to prominence. In a review for NME, Mark Beaumont wrote that \"where The Remote Part was their 'Green'-esque lunge into the spotlight, Warnings/Promises is their full-blown 'Out of Time' spectacular. But with less twangle, more teeth.\" The staff at E! Online expanded on this R.E.M. comparison, stating that it \"doesn't quite have any melodies that rival 'Losing My Religion' or even 'All the Way to Reno,' for that matter\". Drowned in Sound Gareth Dobson saw it as \"the work of a band pushing itself to the limits of its generous, but ultimately not boundless musical ability\". He added that the band's decision to make an album of \"such landmark size and scope has finally stripped the Icarus Woomble of his wings\". In a review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield wrote that the album was \"even better\" than the preceding one, \"a set of hopeless love songs for sad-eyed city girls\"."]}, {"page": "Countryfile", "response": ["| 2009\u20132012 || Country Tracks || Joe CrowleyHelen SkeltonEllie HarrisonLiz BonninMark BeaumontJodie KiddBen Fogle  || "]}, {"page": "Dollar Academy", "response": ["*2016 Mr Mark Beaumont"]}, {"page": "Kleptomania (album)", "response": ["* Mark Beaumont - foreword"]}]}}
