Hastie joined Birmingham from junior football in north London in May 1911, and made his debut on 18 November 1911, standing in for regular outside right Charlie Millington in a 2\u20130 defeat away at Clapton Orient. This was the only first-team game that Hastie, a good dribbler but lacking awareness of the game as a whole, played for the club before leaving for Wycombe Wanderers at the end of the 1911\u201312 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hastie", "response": ["* Ian Hastie (1887\u2013 after 1911), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Iain Hastie", "response": ["Ian Hastie is an association football player who represented New Zealand at international level."]}]}}
