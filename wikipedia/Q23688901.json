He joined the Social Democratic Federation and then its successor, the British Socialist Party (BSP).  However, by the start of World War I, he had joined the Socialist Labour Party (SLP) and had relocated to Leicester.  He was a fervent opponent of the war, and was fined \u00a3100 in 1916 for trying to prevent people from joining the Army.The SLP was heavily involved in the Clyde Workers' Committee and, although he did not succeed in starting such a movement in Leicester, Ramsay supported similar initiatives across the country.  He became treasurer of the Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committees organisation, within which he led efforts to organise the unemployed and was involved in organising ex-servicemen.  In 1919, police claimed that he had given a seditious speech, advocating using machine guns to start a revolution.  Ramsay denied the details, claiming that words had been added to his speech, but was jailed for five months.Ramsay supported the October Revolution, and became the treasurer of the Hands off Russia movement.  He was involved in the negotiations to form the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), being one of the leading opponents of it attempting to affiliate to the Labour Party.  Although he lost the debate, he attended the 2nd Congress of the Communist International as a shop stewards' delegate, along with others such as John S. Clarke, Helen Crawfurd, Williie Gallacher, Wlliam McLaine, JT Murphy, Sylvia Pankhurst, Tom Quelch, Marjory Newbold and Jack Tanner.  In order to do so, he had to obtain a passport, under the cover story that he wished to emigrate to Argentina and, before doing so, visit relatives in Norway (actually a Bolshevik based there).  His request was taken to the Home Secretary, who consulted colleagues but surprisingly decided to grant it.  Following the Congress, he stayed in Russia for a while, working for the Comintern, and frequently travelled between there and the UK.Once Ramsay returned to the UK, he served on the CPGB's Central Committee, and worked as an instructor for the party.  He was also involved in devising propaganda for the party.  In 1926, he was appointed as its Scottish Organiser, and he also served as the election agent for Harry Pollitt in Seaham at the 1929 general election.MI5 kept Ramsay under constant surveillance, believing that he may have been spying for the Soviet Union.  Their internal files stated that he left the CPGB in 1932, and found work as a courier for the Soviet embassy.  However, Harry Pollitt eulogised him in his account of the thirtieth anniversary of the party, suggesting that his departure from the party was merely to try to deflect the attention of the secret services.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Ramsay", "response": ["David Ramsay may refer to:", "* David Ramsay (Ontario politician) (1948\u20132020), Canadian politician in Legislative Assembly of Ontario", "* David Ramsay (historian) (1749\u20131815), American historian and politician from South Carolina", "* David Ramsay (communist) (1883\u20131948), British socialist activist", "*Sir David Ramsay, 4th Baronet (after 1673\u20131710), among Scottish representatives to 1st Parliament of Great Britain MP for Scotland & Kincardineshire", "* David Ramsay (watchmaker) (died c. 1653), British clockmaker and watchmaker", "* David Ramsay (trader) (born c. 1740-died c. 1810), controversial trader in Upper Canada"]}, {"page": "Ramsay (surname)", "response": [":*David Ramsay (disambiguation), several people", ":*David Ramsay (communist) (1883\u20131948), British socialist activist", ":*David Ramsay (congressman) (1749\u20131815), American physician, congressman, and historian", ":*David Ramsay (Ontario politician) (1948\u20132020), Canadian politician in Legislative Assembly of Ontario", ":*David Ramsay (historian) (1749\u20131815), American historian and politician from South Carolina", ":*David Ramsay (trader) (c. 1740\u2013 c. 1810), in Upper Canada; translator, fur and alcohol trader", ":*David Ramsay (watchmaker) (died c. 1653), British clockmaker and watchmaker", ":*Sir David Ramsay, 4th Baronet (after 1673\u20131710), MP for Scotland & Kincardineshire"]}, {"page": "Hands Off Russia", "response": ["The National Committee for the Hands off Russia Movement was elected at a conference in London in January 1919.

T. Murphy organised a national conference of the movement.  The conference agreed to affiliate to the Communist International (Comintern).Graham Stevenson, \"Lismer, Ted\", Compendium of Communist Biography  Gallacher, Murphy, Ramsay and Jack Tanner represented the group at the Second Congress of the Comintern, later in the year,  but affiliation was not permitted, on the grounds that the organisation was not a political party.Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern, p.133  Gallacher rejected suggestions that the movement should affiliate to the International Trade Union Council, a recently founded group of communist trade unions, arguing that it was necessary for members to remain active within mainstream trade unions.  Instead, in September, a compromise was agreed: the movement would affiliate to the new Red International of Labour Unions, while individual members who also held membership of the new Communist Party of Great Britain would come under the discipline of that group.Reiner Tosstorff, The Red International of Labour Unions (RILU) 1920 - 1937, p.274"]}]}}
