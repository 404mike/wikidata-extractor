In February, Paul Marquess became Handford's successor, changing the format of the series to a serialised, soap opera-style system; he also dropped on-screen episode titles for the first time, which did not return until 2007. Marquess had previously worked on Brookside and used similar methods to his time on that series, notably axing a large percentage of the cast including veterans Ben Roberts (Ch. Insp. Derek Conway) and Colin Tarrant (Insp. Andrew Monroe). Their characters were among ten killed off in 2002, more than the total number in the entire series history (nine between 1984 and 2001). Six of the ten characters were killed off in the 2002 station fire, which also led to a major redevelopment of the station set; the CID office was overhauled and the management offices were reduced to accommodate a Community Safety Unit (in keeping with the department's integration to the real-life Metropolitan Police). The move proved controversial but did boost ratings after a decline prior to Marquess arriving, while it allowed him to bring a wide array of new characters. Marquess was highly progressive in representing modern views, casting the first lesbian officer in PC Gemma Osbourne and the show's highest-ranking black officer in Supt. Adam Okaro, amongst others. The series also aired groundbreaking scenes such as the first gay and lesbian kisses, as well as a gay wedding in 2005."]}, {"page": "The Bill (series 18)", "response": ["The show also dropped on-screen titles for the first time in the show's history, the last of which being the episode 'Quinnan: Part 6'. That six-part plot led to the departure of long serving character, PC Dave Quinnan,  as actor Andrew Paul exited the series after 12 years. Unlike Paul, who left voluntarily, many of the early departures were enforced as Marquess dismissed a total of eight characters to make way for a major revamp of the cast as part of the move to a soap-opera style series. The longest serving dismissals were that of Andrew Monroe & Derek Conway, with both Colin Tarrant & Ben Roberts sacked after 12 & 14 years on the show, respectively. Their departure came as part of the events around the second station fire, producers following the same format as the 1990 fire by staging a fire to account for a set redevelopment. The events of the fire, which killed six cast members, were preceded by the murder of Conway in a petrol bomb attack. This led to the second major cast change on the series in as many years, following the Don Beech fiasco that saw CID disbanded in 2000. While the decision to remove a large number of long-term characters was controversial amongst die-hard fans, the dramatic scenes from the fire and its related episodes saw a rise in viewership after it dropped prior to Marquess' introduction. The series also made history by airing its first on-screen gay kiss, and while it led to some 170 complaints, they were all dismissed by the Independent Television Committee, who deemed the scene was not \"sexually explicit\"."]}, {"page": "The Bill", "response": ["* Colin Tarrant played Inspector Andrew Monroe from 1990 to 2002 when he was axed as part of a series overhaul.
