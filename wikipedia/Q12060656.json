M. W. Turner. Several bridges were built across the River Conwy linking the town and Llandudno during the 19th century, including a road bridge in 1826 and a rail bridge in 1848. These improved communication links with the castle and further increased tourist numbers. In 1865 Conwy Castle passed from the Holland family, who had leased it from the descendants of the Conways to the civic leadership of Conwy town. Restoration work on the ruins then began, including the reconstruction of the damaged Bakehouse tower. In 1953 the castle was leased to the Ministry of Works and Arnold Taylor undertook a wide range of repairs and extensive research into the castle's history. An additional road bridge was built to the castle in 1958. Already protected as a scheduled monument, in 1986 it was also declared part of the World Heritage Site of the \"Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd\"."]}, {"page": "Castell Coch", "response": ["Castell Coch remained derelict; the antiquarian John Leland, visiting around 1536, described it as \"all in ruin, no big thing but high\". The artist and illustrator Julius Caesar Ibbetson painted the castle in 1792, depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower, with a lime kiln in operation alongside the fortification. Stone from the castle may have been robbed and used to feed the kilns during this period. A similar view was sketched by an unknown artist in the early 19th century, showing more trees around the ruins; a few years later, Robert Drane recommended the site as a place for picnics and noted its abundance in wild garlic."]}, {"page": "Julius Caesar (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Julius Caesar Ibbetson (1759\u20131817), British painter"]}, {"page": "Tabley House", "response": ["The west side of the first floor is occupied by the gallery, which has been described as \"one of the great rooms of Cheshire\".

The position had first been offered to Julius Caesar Ibbetson, who declined; and then William Daniell, who accepted but subsequently pulled out. Daniell was a fellow student of Westall, and was engaged to one of Westall's stepsisters, so it seems likely that Westall prevailed upon Daniell to recommend him as his replacement; however one source states that Westall was recommended by Benjamin West, President of the Royal Academy. Elisabeth Findlay reconciles these claims by suggesting that Daniell \"contrived\" to have West put Westall's name forward.Findlay (1998): xiii. \"Operating through Benjamin West, the President of the Royal Academy, Daniell contrived to have Westall's name put before Banks.\""]}, {"page": "1759 in art", "response": ["* December 29 \u2013 Julius Caesar Ibbetson, landscape painter (died 1817)"]}, {"page": "1817 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 13 October \u2013 Julius Caesar Ibbetson, landscape painter (born 1759)"]}, {"page": "The Lochmaben Harper", "response": ["This is another of the songs Robert Burns came across and contributed to a Scots Musical Museum.National Burns Collection.
