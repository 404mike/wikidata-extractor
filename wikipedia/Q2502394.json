He was born in Bristol, the son of John Dix, a local surgeon, who wrote The Life of Chatterton the poet, a book of Pen Pictures of Popular English Preachers and other works. His father gave him his middle name in honour of Thomas Chatterton, a poet about whom he had written a biography. He was educated at the Grammar School, Bristol, for a mercantile career, and became manager of a maritime insurance company in Glasgow where he spent most of his life.\n\nFew modern writers have shown so signal a gift as his for the difficult art of hymn-writing. His original hymns are found in most modern hymn-books. He wrote also felicitous renderings in metrical form of Richard Frederick Littledale's translations from the Greek in his Offices of the Holy Eastern Church; and of Rodwell's translations of Abyssinain hymns. Some of his carols, such as The Manger Throne, have been very popular. His hymns and carols also include As with Gladness Men of Old, What Child Is This?, To You, O Lord, Our Hearts We Raise and Alleluia! Sing to Jesus.\nAt the age of 29 he was struck with a near fatal illness and consequently suffered months confined to his bed. During this time he became severely depressed. Yet it is from this period that many of his hymns date. He died at Cheddar, Somerset, England, and was buried at his parish church.\nHis children included the writer Gertrude Dix.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1898 in music", "response": ["*September 9 \u2013 William Chatterton Dix, hymn-writer, 61"]}, {"page": "List of Christmas carols", "response": ["|William Chatterton Dix", "|music: traditional English song \"Greensleeves\", words: William Chatterton Dix"]}, {"page": "Greensleeves", "response": ["Christmas and New Year texts were associated with the tune from as early as 1686, and by the 19th century almost every printed collection of Christmas carols included some version of words and music together, most of them ending with the refrain \"On Christmas Day in the morning\".John M.

He was afflicted by an unexpected and severe illness that resulted in him being bedridden and suffering from severe depression.  His near-death experience brought about a spiritual renewal in him while he was recovering.  During this time, he read the Bible comprehensively and was inspired to author hymns like \"Alleluia! Sing to Jesus!\" and \"As with Gladness Men of Old\".  The precise time in 1865 when he wrote the poem \"The Manger Throne\" is disputed.

As a result Greek, Latin and even German hymns in translation entered the mainstream of English hymnody. These translations were composed by people like John Chandler, John Mason Neale, Thomas Helmore, Edward Caswall, Jane Laurie Borthwick and Catherine Winkworth. Besides stimulating the translation of medieval hymns, and use of plainsong melodies, the Oxford Reformers, inspired by Reginald Heber's work, also began to write original hymns.
