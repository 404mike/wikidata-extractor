H. Asquith", "response": ["On Monday 3 August, the Belgian Government rejected the German demand for free passage through its country and in the afternoon, \"with gravity and unexpected eloquence\", Grey spoke in the Commons and called for British action \"against the unmeasured aggrandisement of any power\". Basil Liddell Hart considered that this speech saw the \"hardening (of) British opinion to the point of intervention\". The following day Asquith saw the King and an ultimatum to Germany demanding withdrawal from Belgian soil was issued with a deadline of midnight Berlin time, 11.00\u00a0p.m. (GMT). Margot Asquith described the moment of expiry, somewhat inaccurately, in these terms: \"(I joined) Henry in the Cabinet room. Lord Crewe and Sir Edward Grey were already there and we sat smoking cigarettes in silence\u00a0\u2026 The clock on the mantelpiece hammered out the hour and when the last beat of midnight struck it was as silent as dawn. We were at War.\"", "The insatiable demand for manpower for the Western Front had been foreseen early on. A volunteer system had been introduced at the outbreak of war, and Asquith was reluctant to change it for political reasons, as many Liberals, and almost all of their Irish Nationalist and Labour allies, were strongly opposed to conscription. Volunteer numbers dropped, not meeting the demands for more troops for Gallipoli, and much more strongly, for the Western Front. This made the voluntary system increasingly untenable; Asquith's daughter Violet wrote in March 1915, \"Gradually every man with the average number of limbs and faculties is being sucked out to the war.\" In July 1915, the National Registration Act was passed, requiring compulsory registration for all men between the ages of 18 and 65. This was seen by many as the prelude to conscription but the appointment of Lord Derby as Director-General of Recruiting instead saw an attempt to rejuvenate the voluntary system, the Derby Scheme. Asquith's slow steps towards conscription continued to infuriate his opponents. Sir Henry Wilson, for example, wrote this to Leo Amery: \"What is going to be the result of these debates? Will 'wait and see' win, or can that part of the Cabinet that is in earnest and is honest force that damned old Squiff into action?\" The Prime Minister's balancing act, within Parliament and within his own party, was not assisted by a strident campaign against conscription conducted by his wife. Describing herself as \"passionately against it\", Margot Asquith engaged in one of her frequent influencing drives, by letters and through conversations, which had little impact other than doing \"great harm\" to Asquith's reputation and position.", "Asquith first considered taking the vacant War Office himself but then offered it to Law, who declined it in favour of Lloyd George. This was an important sign of growing unity of action between the two men and it filled Margot Asquith with foreboding: \"I look upon this as the greatest political blunder of Henry's lifetime, \u2026 We are out: it can only be a question of time now when we shall have to leave Downing Street.\"", "Margot Asquith immediately sensed the coming danger: \"From that night it was quite clear that Northcliffe, Rothermere, Bonar, Carson, Ll.G (and a man called Max Aitken) were going to run the Government. I knew it was the end.\" Grey was similarly prescient and wrote, \"Lloyd George means to break up the Government.\" Law saw the debate as a threat to his own political position, as well as another instance of lack of grip by the government.", "Lord Northcliffe's role was critical, as was the use Lloyd George made of him, and of the press in general. Northcliffe's involvement also highlights the limitations of both Aitken's and Lloyd George's accounts of Asquith's fall. Both minimised Northcliffe's part in the events. In his War Memoirs, Lloyd George stated emphatically \"Lord Northcliffe was never, at any stage, brought into our consultations.\" Aitken supported this by saying, \"Lord Northcliffe was not in active co-operation with Lloyd George.\" But these claims are contradicted by others. In their biography of Northcliffe, Reginald Pound and Geoffrey Harmsworth record Northcliffe's brother Rothermere writing contemporaneously, \"Alfred has been actively at work with Ll.G. with a view to bringing about a change.\" Riddell wrote in his diary for 27 May 1916: \"LG never mentions directly that he sees Northcliffe but I am sure they are in daily contact.\" Margot Asquith was also certain of Northcliffe's role, and of Lloyd George's involvement, although she obscured both of their names when writing in her diary: \"I only hope the man responsible for giving information to Lord N- will be heavily punished: God may forgive him; I never can.\" They are also contradicted by events; Northcliffe met with Lloyd George on each of the three days just prior to Lloyd George's resignation, on 1, 2, and 3 December, including two meetings on 1 December, both before and after Lloyd George put his revised proposals for the War Council to Asquith. It seems improbable that ongoing events were not discussed and that the two men confined their conversations to negotiating article circulation rights for Lloyd George once he had resigned, as Pound and Harmsworth weakly suggest. The attempts made by others to use Northcliffe and the wider press also merit consideration. In this regard, some senior military officers were extremely active. Robertson, for example, wrote to Northcliffe in October 1916, \"The Boche gives me no trouble compared with what I meet in London. So any help you can give me will be of Imperial value.\" Lastly, the actions of Northcliffe's newspapers must be considered\u2014in particular The Times editorial on 4 December which led Asquith to reject Lloyd George's final War Council proposals. Thompson, Northcliffe's most recent biographer, concludes, \"From the evidence, it appears that Northcliffe and his newspapers should be given more credit than they have generally received for the demise of the Asquith government in December 1916.\"", "*Bodleian Library catalogue record (finding aid) of Margot Asquith's private papers"]}, {"page": "Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery", "response": ["By his wife Hannah de Rothschild, Rosebery had two sons and two daughters, with whom, according to Margot Asquith, he loved to play:"]}, {"page": "Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire", "response": ["Upon receiving news of the Duke's death, the House of Lords took the unprecedented step of adjourning in his honour.Hansard, THE LATE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE HL Deb 24 March 1908 vol 186 cc1178-83 .
