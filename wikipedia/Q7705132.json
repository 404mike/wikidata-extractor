Soon afterwards, Burley resigned citing differences between himself and the board. He was replaced by Bolton Wanderers first team coach Phil Brown.

His professional career began on his 17th birthday when he signed a professional contract with Derby County after being a trainee.

Barnes intermittently made first-team appearances as Derby struggled but began to command a regular place when Phil Brown was replaced by Derby's academy manager Terry Westley in January 2006. Westley was familiar with Barnes from his time as a youngster at Derby and made him an integral part of the team as Derby managed to avoid relegation to League One. Barnes played a role in 16 matches under Westley, with his first start coming in Westley's first match in charge (a narrow 1\u20130 home defeat to Sheffield United) and his first professional goal coming in a 2\u20132 draw away to Watford."]}, {"page": "I\u00f1igo Idiakez", "response": ["At Derby, Idiakez played in an advanced position and took most free kicks and corners.
