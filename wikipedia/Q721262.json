In 1998, the Danish, Oscar-nominated film production company Zentropa became the world's first mainstream film company to openly produce hardcore pornographic films, starting with Constance (1998). That same year, Zentropa also produced Idioterne (1998), directed by Lars von Trier, which won many international awards and was nominated for a Golden Palm in Cannes. The film includes a shower sequence with a male erection and an orgy scene with close-up penetration footage (the camera viewpoint is from the ankles of the participants, and the close-ups leave no doubt as to what is taking place). Idioterne started a wave of international mainstream arthouse films featuring explicit sexual images, such as Catherine Breillat's Romance, which starred pornstar Rocco Siffredi."]}, {"page": "Outline of British pornography", "response": ["* Viv Thomas"]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Viv Thomas (born 1948), South African-born British pornographic producer"]}, {"page": "Pornography in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The 1977 softcore sex comedy film Come Play with Me, which had been highly successful commercially at the cinema, became one of the first British films to sell in large numbers on the new VHS format. In 1979 Paul Raymond launched the Electric Blue series of softcore videos, a range which was produced until the mid 1990s. They were an extension of his magazine publishing into new media. An Electric Blue special VHS video, A Night at the Revuebar (1983), included extensive footage of the 1980s version of The Festival of Erotica show from the Raymond Revuebar. Meanwhile, in the early eighties John Lindsay began selling compilations of his hardcore films on video through mail order, taking advantage of the then unregulated state of the British video industry. Another director to take advantage of this unregulated period was Mike Freeman, who in 1979 set up the hardcore video production company Videx Ltd. and employed Lindsay Honey as an actor. Honey went on run his own mail order hardcore video business with his partner Linzi Drew until the pair were convicted in 1992. During the 1990s and 2000s, Honey used the name Ben Dover to produce and direct gonzo pornography videos. Another successful producer of pornographic videos at this time was Viv Thomas. He began producing pornographic videos in the 1980s, moving into producing hardcore material exclusively once doing so became legal in 1999. Thomas has become known as an established producer of lesbian pornography and with a reputation for producing artistic pornographic films with an emphasis on high production values. Female directors include Tanya Hyde, who began as a hardcore actor in the mid-90s and since 2004 has been a prolific director of hardcore fetish titles for the British pornographic film production company Harmony Films."]}, {"page": "Anette Dawn", "response": ["| Butterfly || 2005 || Bridgett || Viv Thomas || Viv Thomas", "| Our Movie || 2005 || Bridgett || Viv Thomas || Viv Thomas", "| Sandy: Agent Provocateur || 2005 || Bridgett || Viv Thomas || Viv Thomas", "| Sticky Fingers || 2005 || Bridgett || Viv Thomas || Viv Thomas", "| Viv's Dream Team || 2005 || Bridgett || Viv Thomas || Viv Thomas"]}, {"page": "Viv (given name)", "response": ["* Viv Thomas (born 1948), British pornographer"]}, {"page": "List of pornographic film directors", "response": ["*Viv Thomas"]}]}}
