He made his debut for the Boro in a 2\u20131 defeat by York City on 15 August 2006. The defender scored his only goal for the club in a 2\u20130 win over Grays Athletic on 17 February 2007. He was ever-present throughout the 2006\u201307 season, making thirty-seven league appearances in all. He was also indispensable to the club's FA Trophy success, featuring in both semi-final legs which saw Stevenage Borough beat Grays Athletic 3\u20131 on aggregate. He was part of the squad that played in the 2007 FA Trophy Final against Kidderminster Harriers on 12 May 2007 in front of a record FA Trophy crowd of 53,262. Stevenage came back from 2\u20130 down to ultimately triumph 3\u20132 following an 88th-minute goal by Steve Morison; the victory was all the more significant for Fuller as he became a member of the first team to win a competitive final at the new Wembley Stadium. He would go on to make 24 league appearances for the Boro during the 2007\u201308 season before subsequently leaving the club to sign a two-year deal with League One side Gillingham on 28 January 2008 along with teammate Stuart Lewis; reuniting him with the manager who had previously recruited him at Stevenage Borough, Mark Stimson."]}, {"page": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

He scored one goal during the campaign, netting in a 1\u20131 draw against Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Stadium in April 2008. The 2008\u201309 campaign was Nutter's first full season at Gillingham. He had been joined by former Stevenage players Barry Fuller, Alan Julian, and Stuart Lewis, as well as Dennis Oli, who he played alongside at Grays. Nutter made 54 appearances during the campaign, a season in which Gillingham earned promotion back to League One following a 1\u20130 win over Shrewsbury Town in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium in May 2009. He provided 11 assists from left-back during the season. The promotion meant that it was the third of Nutter's career, having also enjoyed league success at Aldershot and Grays."]}, {"page": "1988 World Rally Championship", "response": ["| Stuart Lewis"]}, {"page": "Mark Hughes (footballer, born 1983)", "response": ["From Oldham Athletic he moved into the non-League with Thurrock, but was back in the league a few months later, joining League One side Chesterfield agreed to take him on loan.
