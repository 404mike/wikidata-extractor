Then, u/johnnymetoo posted the complete version of the song, which he obtained from a link on one of Lydia's Usenet posts before deletion. Since then, many contacts have been made which pertain to the search, such as Paul Baskerville, one of the Musik F\u00fcr Junge Leute hosts, GEMA, a German government and performance rights organization, and a YouTube channel named \"80zforever\", which has many videos of obscure music. These contacts and leads are kept in a spreadsheet to keep track of the investigation. The community's official Discord server has also found various undocumented and/or obscure media of various genres. Since it became an internet phenomenon, a number of cover versions of the song were created, including a cover by American band Mephisto Walz titled \"Like The Wind\" and released on their 2020 album All These Winding Roads, as well as a cover by Mike Mills of the Australian band Toehider. Baskerville suspects that the song was a demo recording that was played once by an NDR presenter and then thrown away."]}, {"page": "Baskerville, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Baskerville"]}]}}
