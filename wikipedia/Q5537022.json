Blair-Bell and the committee decided to approach some leading Southern England and London based paediatricians, as the GVS was essentially a Liverpool-based club, deciding it would be politically prudent before starting to work on the Memorandum and Articles of Association. In July 1926, Sir Francis Champneys, Sir George Blacker, Thomas Watts Eden, Herbert R. Spencer and Archibald Donald were all approached to meet the committee at Comyns Berkeley's house in London. The group put up considerable resistance to the idea with Herbert R. Spencer providing the most reserved, arguing that there was no need for a new college, arguing that the colleges should be amalgamated into a Royal Academy of Medicine. George Blacker also criticised the plan, stating that it was against the vested interest of the established colleges. The greatest problem identified was whether the new institution should be an association or college. Blair-Bell was uncompromising in his action that it should be a college."]}, {"page": "Blacker, George", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Blacker (obstetrician)"]}, {"page": "George Blacker", "response": ["George Blacker may refer to: ", "* George Blacker (antiquary) (1791\u20131871), Irish clergyman and antiquary", "* Sir George Blacker (obstetrician) (1865\u20131948), British\u2013Irish obstetrician", "* George Blackerby (1903\u20131987), professional baseball player"]}]}}
