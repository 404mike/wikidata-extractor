Timothy was from a family steeped in rallying history and started his rallying career in the Rallysport Association Championship, competing in a Vauxhall Nova and winning a number of events in his class.  He was into his second year in the British Rally Championship and was tipped to be a future talent in British and potentially World Rallying.\nCathcart's co-driver Dai Roberts was injured and airlifted to a Belfast hospital but made a full recovery. Dai's brother Gareth Roberts, also a co-driver, died in a similar accident at the Targa Florio in June 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 7", "response": ["*1994 \u2013 Timothy Cathcart, Northern Irish race car driver (died 2014)"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Timothy Cathcart, 20, rally driver."]}, {"page": "2014 British Rally Championship", "response": ["|align=left|  Timothy Cathcart"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2014", "response": ["*Timothy Cathcart, 20, Northern Irish rally driver, race collision.Timothy Cathcart death: Tributes paid to rally crash victim"]}]}}
