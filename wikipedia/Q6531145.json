Whilst as an amateur he gained experience at both Wimbledon and Hayes F.C. on loan, before turning professional with the Bees in March 1936 as an outside-right. On 24 May 1939, he was capped by England, replacing the injured Stanley Matthews against Romania, to become Brentford's second and final England international to date following Billy Scott in 1936.When the war broke out, Smith played a vital part in the RAF as a rear gunner, where he consequently met his future wife, Joan (who was part of the women's RAF). However Smith still managed to play for Brentford during the war. He also played 13 wartime internationals for England, 11 whilst a Brentford player and 2 once transferred to Aston Villa. He also played in 3 'unofficial International matches', under the guise of an FA XI, but all players played in England shirts, all were English and all received notification on English FA headed paper.\nAs a consequence of the Second World War, regionalized football returned.In October 1945, Smith signed for Aston Villa for a fee of \u00a37,500, where he spent six seasons and became a crowd favourite. In 1952, he returned to Brentford, for a fee of \u00a33,000, where he spent one season before retiring.
