The new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, had announced prior to the election she would be willing to include Sinn F\u00e9in in multi-party talks without prior decommissioning of weapons within two months of an IRA ceasefire. After the IRA declared a new ceasefire in July 1997, Sinn F\u00e9in was admitted into multi-party talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998. One aim of the agreement was that all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland fully disarm by May 2000. The IRA began decommissioning in a process that was monitored by Canadian General John de Chastelain's Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), with some weapons being decommissioned on 23 October 2001 and 8 April 2002. The October 2001 decommissioning was the first time an Irish republican paramilitary organisation had voluntarily disposed of its arms. In October 2002 the devolved Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended by the British government and direct rule returned, in order to prevent a unionist walkout. This was partly triggered by Stormontgate\u2014allegations that republican spies were operating within the Parliament Buildings and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)\u2014and the IRA temporarily broke off contact with de Chastelain. However, further decommissioning took place on 21 October 2003. In the aftermath of the December 2004 Northern Bank robbery, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell stated there could be no place in government in either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland for a party that supported or threatened the use of violence, possessed explosives or firearms, and was involved in criminality. At the beginning of February 2005, the IRA declared that it was withdrawing a decommissioning offer from late 2004. This followed a demand from the Democratic Unionist Party, under Paisley, insisting on photographic evidence of decommissioning."]}, {"page": "September 18", "response": ["*  1949   \u2013 Mo Mowlam, English academic and politician, Minister for the Cabinet Office (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "1949", "response": ["** Mo Mowlam, British politician (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "2005", "response": ["** Mo Mowlam, British politician and peace campaigner (b. 1949)"]}, {"page": "Gerry Adams", "response": ["* 2010 \u2013 TV film Mo, with actor John Lynch, the story of Mo Mowlam and the Good Friday Agreement."]}, {"page": "HM Prison Maze", "response": ["The prisoners also played a significant role in the Northern Ireland peace process.

They had voted for their political representatives to pull out of talks. Shortly after Mowlam's visit, they changed their minds, allowing their representatives to continue talks that would lead to the Good Friday Agreement of 10 April 1998. Afterwards, the prison was emptied of its paramilitary prisoners as the groups they represented agreed to the ceasefire. In the two years following the agreement, 428 prisoners were released.

They operated outside the Combined Loyalist Military Command and ignored the ceasefire order of October 1994. Wright denounced the UVF leadership as \"communists\", for the left wing inclinations of some of their public statements about reconciliation with nationalists. Wright was strongly anti-communist and his belief in this was increased by a series of meetings he held with representatives of far right Christian groups from the southern states of the US. From these meetings, organised by Pastor Kenny McClinton, Wright was introduced to conspiracy theories about the role of communists in bringing down Christian morality, ideas that appealed to him. In a somewhat similar vein, Wright also enjoyed closed relations with a Bolton-based cell of activists belonging to the neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 and had members of this group staying in Portadown during the build-up to the Drumcree stand-off in 1997. The UVF in its turn, regarded Wright setting up a rival loyalist organisation in the Mid-Ulster area as \"treason\". Members of the Belfast UVF often contemptuously referred to Wright as \"Billy Wrong\", with one UVF leader suggesting that Wright was motivated by \"religious zealotry and blind bigotry\". The LVF was proscribed by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam in June 1997."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Dr Mo Mowlam"]}, {"page": "Johnny Adair", "response": ["In January 1998, Adair was one of five loyalist prisoners visited in the prison by British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mo Mowlam.

Despite later calling Labour under Blair \"the idea of a Conservative group who had taken over Labour\" and saying \"[Blair] set up a new political party, New Labour\", his political diaries Free at Last show that Benn was initially somewhat sympathetic to Blair, welcoming a change of government. Benn supported the introduction of the national minimum wage, and welcomed the progress towards peace and security in Northern Ireland (particularly under Mo Mowlam). He was supportive of the extra money given to public services in the New Labour years but believed it to be under the guise of privatisation. Overall, his concluding judgement on New Labour is highly critical; he describes its evolution as a way of retaining office by abandoning socialism and distancing the party from the trade union movement, adopting a presidentialist style of politics, overriding the concept of the collective ministerial responsibility by reducing the power of the Cabinet, eliminated any effective influence from the annual conference of the Labour Party and \"hinged its foreign policy on support for one of the worst presidents in US history\"."]}, {"page": "St Albion Parish News", "response": ["Some weeks there was an item \"To Remember In Your Prayers\", seeking understanding for former colleagues who had resigned or been sacked, for example Mo Mowlam, Clare Short and Charles Clarke.
