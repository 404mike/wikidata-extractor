She was \"a woman of strong mind, powerful feeling, and of no inconsiderable share of tact.\" Her work focused on promoting women's rights (see her books The Wrongs of Women and Helen Fleetwood) and evangelical Protestantism, as seen in her book Protection; or, The Candle and the Dog, in which the following characteristic quote appears: \"Our greatest blessings come to us by prayer, and the studying of God's word.\" As Isabella A. Owen remarked in 1901, \"She was above all else an anti-Romanist, a most protesting Protestant.\" Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote of her memoir Personal Recollections (1841): \"We know of no piece of autobiography in the English language which can compare with this in richness of feeling and description and power of exciting interest.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1847 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna \u2013 The System"]}, {"page": "1846 in literature", "response": ["*July 12 \u2013 Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna, English novelist (born 1790)"]}, {"page": "1844 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna \u2013 The Wrongs of Women"]}, {"page": "1843 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna \u2013 Perils of the Nation"]}, {"page": "1841 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna"]}, {"page": "1832 in literature", "response": ["*Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna \u2013 Combination"]}, {"page": "1790 in literature", "response": ["*October 1 \u2013 Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna, English novelist (died 1846)"]}, {"page": "Conformity (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Conformity: A Tale, a novel by Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna"]}, {"page": "Windsor, Nova Scotia", "response": ["* Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna"]}, {"page": "Hugh M'Neile", "response": ["* \"Charlotte Elizabeth\" (nom de guerre of Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna), The Protestant Annual 1841, Francis Baisler, (London), 1840."]}, {"page": "Annapolis Royal", "response": ["* Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna"]}, {"page": "Camellia japonica", "response": ["The following is a poem written by English evangelical Protestant writer Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna in 1834:"]}, {"page": "Charlotte Elizabeth", "response": ["#redirect Charlotte Elizabeth Tonna"]}]}}
