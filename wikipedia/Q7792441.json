As early as 1880 at Carlton Road School he had children playing Association Football. Midgley was a founder member of the Burnley Rovers Rugby club and its first captain. Midgley encouraged Burnley Rovers to change codes to association football in May 1882 and changed their name to Burnley. He represented the club in many of the early friendly matches, but by the time the Football League was formed in 1888, Midgley was nearing the end of his career as a footballer.Midgley was proud to be involved in the early days of League Football. He made his League debut, playing as an inside\u2013forward on 20 October 1888 at Victoria Ground the then home of Stoke. The visitors lost 4\u20133. That was Midgeley's only appearance in season 1888\u201389 and he was not retained at the end of the season. However at least his only League appearance he played in a forward line that scored three. Also Midgeley's appearance was historic as he was approximately (his birthdate in 1856 is unknown) 34 years and 112 days old. Therefore, on the seventh weekend of League football not only did Thomas Midgeley supplant Dannie Friel as Burnley's oldest League player but Midgeley also replaced Joe Beverley of Blackburn Rovers as the League's oldest player.Midgley carried on teaching until he retired in 1921. Five years after retiring he moved to Wales.", "link_mentions": {}}}
