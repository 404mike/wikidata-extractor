In doing so, Anscombe set a team record for most points in a match. In the same match, Rene Ranger became the first Blues player to receive a White Card, which resulted in a two-week suspension. Seven consecutive losses followed, beginning with the Stormers in round four, and finishing with the Hurricanes in round eleven. Growing frustration amongst fans was evident during this period, with racist remarks directed at coach Pat Lam via social media, talkback radio and the Blues own website. Lam, who is of Samoan descent, received support from a number of former Blues players during this period, including Michael Jones and Eroni Clarke. After beating the Lions in round twelve, the Blues suffered the biggest defeat in club history with a 59 \u2013 12 loss away to the Crusaders, which was followed by losses at home to the Highlanders and table-topping Chiefs. The Blues finished the season on a high note, with wins against the Western Force and Brumbies.", "The 2013 season saw an all new Blues team with many players leaving, including Ma'a Nonu to the Highlanders and Gareth Anscombe to the Chiefs.

The Blues then travelled to South Africa with two must win games against the Sharks and the Cheetahs, unfortunately losing both and ending the Blues chances of making the play-offs. Ali Williams played his 100th game for the Blues against the Sharks.  The Blues returned to New Zealand with a last home game against the already play-off qualified Chiefs. Despite a red card to Kane Barrett for stomping in the 23rd minute, the Blues played a remarkably strong game, taking the lead just after half-time but a yellow card to first-five Baden Kerr struck another blow for the Blues.  The mounting Chiefs pressure paid off resulting in a Ben Tameifuna try with 17 minutes to go, winning the game for the Chiefs.  The Blues walked off the field to a standing ovation from their fans, the first time an Eden Park crowd had been upstanding for a defeat.http://www.theblues.co.nz/Draw-And-Results/Match-Report/2013-7-13.aspx", "| 1. || Gareth Anscombe || 29 || Bulls || 2012"]}, {"page": "Ospreys (rugby union)", "response": ["*  Gareth Anscombe", "* Gareth Anscombe: (2015\u2013)"]}, {"page": "Cardiff Rugby", "response": ["Jarrad Hoeata and Gareth Anscombe signed from New Zealand, Italian international Manoa Vosawai and Welsh internationals Tavis Knoyle, Josh Turnbull, Craig Mitchell and Adam Jones have been confirmed.

He was ultimately selected for the tournament, and made an appearance off the bench in the opening match against Ireland after Biggar suffered an early injury; he scored 11 points in the match, landing a conversion and three penalties, but missed a late drop goal attempt as the match finished 16\u201316. Biggar recovered in time to keep the starting job for the next game against Scotland, and in each of the next three games, Priestland was restricted to no more than cameo appearances in the final 10 minutes, although he did land two conversions as Wales mounted a late, but unsuccessful comeback against England. With Wales leading 46\u20137 in the final match against Italy, Priestland came on to play the final 22 minutes, and was successful with all three of his conversion attempts as Wales went on to win 67\u201314.
