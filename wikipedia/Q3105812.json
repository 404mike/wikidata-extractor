He joined the army, receiving a commission in the Durham Light Infantry in November 1940 and was subsequently recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE). In November 1942, he was sent into France to join the newly formed Prosper network, but on 24 June 1943 was arrested by the Gestapo, together with cell leader Francis Suttill and courier Andr\u00e9e Borrel.\nNorman was taken to the Paris headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst at 84 Avenue Foch. The Germans used Norman's captured wireless set to transmit their own false messages to SOE Headquarters in Baker Street.  Norman attempted to warn London that he was in captivity by not giving the Germans the second part of his security check, which they did not know about. Omitting the security check from a message was specifically designed to act as a duress code which would warn London that the sender was being coerced. However, Norman was frustrated when London sent a curt reply telling him to correct the omission.\nThe Germans were thus able to set a trap which resulted in the capture of Jack Agazarian who had been sent with Nicholas Bodington to investigate the fate of the Prosper network.  Norman was shipped to Mauthausen concentration camp, where he was executed on 6 September 1944.\nMajor Gilbert Norman is honoured on the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey, England and as also on the \"Roll of Honour\" on the Valen\u00e7ay SOE Memorial in the town of Valen\u00e7ay, in the Indre depart\u00e9ment of France.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people who were executed", "response": ["* Gilbert Norman (d. 1944)"]}, {"page": "Andr\u00e9e Borrel", "response": ["Madam Gu\u00e9pin, the wife of George Darling (who ran a resistance group in north-west France), said Borrel \"Had a head on her shoulders and a will of iron\", and was \"utterly loyal and devoted to Prosper [Suttill], as her chief, and to Archambaud (Gilbert Norman).\" Norman was the W/T operator."]}, {"page": "Vera Atkins", "response": ["Controversy has lasted in certain circles as to how and why clues that one of F section's main spy networks had been penetrated by the Germans were not picked up, and Buckmaster and Atkins failed to pull out agents at risk.

In January 1943, the three were joined by Henri D\u00e9ricourt, air operations officer, who arranged for clandestine air flights between England and northern France to transport agents and supplies.   ", "Acting on the information collected by the Dutch infiltrators and other sources, on 23 June the Germans began arresting members of Prosper including Norman, Borrel, and Suttill. Over the next three months, thirty SOE agents and hundreds of local agents associated with Prosper were arrested, of whom 167 are known to have been deported to Germany where about one-half were executed, killed, or died in concentration camps. The Germans also captured Norman's wireless and sent or forced Norman to send messages to SOE in London to project an air of normalcy in Paris. The SOE F Section chief, Maurice Buckmaster ignored clear indications in the text of the messages that they were not authentic. A newly arrived wireless operator, Noor Inayat Khan, initially escaped arrest and informed SOE headquarters of the arrests although the situation in Paris was unclear. The SOE believed that Gilbert Norman was still free because of the messages sent from his machine.", "Agazarian returned to France via airplane on the night of 22\u201323 July 1943 with F Section Deputy Nicolas Bodington in a mission to determine the status of the Prosper network. They were met by D\u00e9ricourt, who had not been arrested and was under suspicion of being a German double agent, but was Bodington's friend. Through an exchange of radio messages between Agazarian and \"Gilbert Norman\" (actually the Germans) a meeting was arranged with \"Norman\" on 30 July at an address in the rue de Rome near Gare St-Lazare. Bodington and Agazarian were suspicious. According to M.R.D. Foot, they tossed a coin to see who would attend the meeting and Agazarian lost. Agazarian was arrested by the Germans when he arrived at the meeting site. Bodington later returned safely to England to report that the Prosper network had indeed been destroyed by the Germans."]}, {"page": "John Renshaw Starr", "response": ["The head of the Paris SD was an ex-policemen named Hans Kieffer, a man more dedicated to persuasion than torture. Kieffer persuaded Starr to use his artistic talents to redraw a map and some charts of SOE operations in France.

Another SOE prisoner at 84 Avenue Foch was Gilbert Norman who told Starr that the Germans knew everything about SOE and that nothing he said would be news to them. Starr justified his cooperation with the SD by saying he was gathering information on SD operations that would be useful to SOE if he could escape. Along with SOE wireless operator, Noor Inyat Khan, and a French colonel, Leon Faye, he tried to escape in late 1943 by climbing out the skylight of his room onto the roof of the building, but the three were soon recaptured.Glass, pp. 104\u2013110.Foot, pp. 333\u2013334 Kieffer threatened to shoot them, but relented on condition that they gave their word of honor not to attempt another escape.

Suttill was fluent in spoken French, but had an accent and he relied on Borrel, already experienced in the resistance, for much of his communication. After meeting in Paris, Suttill and Borrel took a month long trip around central France, exploring the potential for setting up resistance networks.  They posed as an agricultural salesman and his assistant. Their early successes and high level of activity led SOE to send them two wireless operators, Gilbert Norman (Archambaud) in November, and Jack Agazarian (Marcel) in December. Most SOE networks had only one wireless operator.Helm, 12, 28-29Suttill and Foot, ", "On the night of 15-16 June, two SOE agents, Canadians John Kenneth Macalister and Frank Pickersgill, were dropped to one of sub-network leader Pierre Culioli's reception sites. On the morning of 21 June, Culioli and his courier, Yvonne Rudellat, set off with the two Canadians to catch a train to Paris unaware that the Germans had set up extensive roadblocks. They were caught and the Germans found packages of letters and instructions and radio crystals in the car, two of which were clearly labelled \"For Archambaud\". This led the Germans to Archambaud (Gilbert Norman, Suttill's wireless operator) because, as Culioli admitted after the war, he had the address of Archambaud in his briefcase when he was caught. Shortly after midnight of 23 June, a German officer pretending to be one of the recently parachuted Canadian agents came to the apartment where Norman was staying and he and Andr\u00e9e Borrel were arrested. The apartment was full of identification cards and other documents. The Germans learned, presumably from the documents or from one of those arrested, where Suttill was and he was arrested mid-morning on 24 June where he was staying in a cheap hotel.", "On 25 June, an agent in Paris radioed SOE headquarters in London that Suttill, Norman, and Borrel \"had disappeared, believed arrested.\" Thereafter, there was radio silence from Paris about the fate of Suttill until 7 July when a message from Gilbert Norman's radio arrived in London. The message confirmed that Suttill had been captured, but apparently Norman was still at large and transmitting.  However, the message was strange. It was distorted, but that could have been caused by atmospheric conditions.  The style of transmitting, the \"fist,\" was different than the usual for Norman, and, most importantly, both the \"bluff\" and \"true\" checks were missing from the message. These checks were spelling mistakes or phrases deliberately inserted into a message by a wireless operator to prove that it was indeed he or she who was transmitting.  The absence of the checks in a message meant the operator or the radio, or both, were under the control of the Germans and transmitting under duress. Norman had a high reputation for efficiency and character and SOE's French section leader, Maurice Buckmaster, refused to believe that he had been captured. He sent back a message to Norman's radio saying, \"You have forgotten your double security check.  Be more careful next time.\" Buckmaster had inadvertently told the Germans how to transmit messages to SOE which would be accepted as genuine.Helm, p. 34-37", "Dr. Josef Goetz was the wireless expert at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris, the headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the security service of the German SS. When wireless operator Gilbert Norman was captured on 23 June, the Germans also captured his wireless set.  With this wireless, and others soon captured, including that of Noor Inayat Khan, and after Buckmaster's blunder on 7 July Goetz was able to play radio games (\"Funkspiel\") with SOE headquarters. His false messages were regarded as genuine.  He was able to pretend for months that the Prosper network was still functioning. The practical results were that Goetz deceived SOE into air-dropping arms and equipment into German hands and, with details of their travel, the Germans captured 17 SOE agents immediately upon their arrival in France.Foot, pp. 328-335.Suttill, 2014, page 343Helm, 306-314 ", "The role of Henri Dericourt, Suttill's air movements officer, in the destruction of the Physician/Prosper network is much debated. Dericourt, as mentioned above, arranged for the arrival and departure of SOE agents by air and collected their mail, including their uncoded reports, for transmittal to London. He was highly successful in these duties, but doubts about him began to be expressed in June 1943, at about the same time that Germans had begun destroying the Prosper network.  Several SOE agents communicated that \"Gilbert is a traitor,\" but it is unclear whether they were talking about Dericourt, code named Gilbert, or Gilbert Norman who had been captured by the Germans. In October 1943, Henri Frager, a veteran resistance leader, flew to London specifically to denounce Dericourt as a traitor.

Starr was arrested by the Germans in Dijon on 18 July 1943. He was shot in the thigh and foot while trying to escape, beaten, tortured, starved, and transferred from prison to prison. Starr arrived at Avenue Foch in late September, still on crutches. He was met by Vogt who, like Kieffer and most of his people, dressed in civilian clothes.  Vogt gave Starr tea and lunch and interrogated him in a friendly manner. He introduced Starr to Gilbert Norman, another SOE agent who was also a prisoner, and gave them a few minutes alone to chat. According to Starr, Norman told him that the Germans knew everything about SOE and there was no point in hiding information. Norman also said that the Germans must have infiltrated SOE headquarters in London.   ", "Kieffer's great accomplishment was the destruction of Prosper (or Physician), SOE's largest and most important network (or circuit) of agents. Based in Paris, Prosper operated from the \"Ardennes to the Atlantic\" with 30 SOE agents and hundreds of French resisters in its orbit.  The three key personnel of Prosper were organiser (leader) Francis Suttill, wireless operator Gilbert Norman, and courier Andr\u00e9e Borrel. The three had been chosen for SOE's \"most challenging job: to establish a circuit in Paris, covering a vast chunk of central France.\"  ", "Josef Goetz was the radio expert in Kieffer's headquarters. Along with the SOE agents captured, the Germans also captured the radios of several wireless operators, including that of Gilbert Norman. SOE headquarters in London was quickly informed by wireless operators still at large of the disappearance of Suttill. London, however, was reassured on 7 July when a wireless message arrived from Norman's wireless, saying that Suttill had been captured, but that he (Norman) was still free. Goetz had sent the message, or dictated it to Norman to send. But the message omitted the security code, which should have told London that Norman was transmitting under duress. Instead, London rebuked him for forgetting his security code, thereby telling Goetz how to send messages to SOE headquarters that would be accepted as authentic. According to Goetz, this incident caused Norman's resistance to cooperating with the Germans to crumble. With the captured wirelesses and knowledge of the need to include a security check in the messages, Goetz and Kieffer were able to play radio games (\"Funkspiel\") with SOE headquarters. The practical results were that Goetz deceived SOE into air-dropping arms and equipment into German hands and the Germans captured several SOE agents immediately upon their arrival in France.
