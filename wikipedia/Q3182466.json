During the four-year run of Reluctant Heroes at the Whitehall, Rix also sent out national tours of the play, generally with John Slater playing the dread Sergeant Bell, and always playing to packed houses. To give some sense of its popularity, at one time Rix had the play running at the Whitehall, three tours on the road and the film on release. Rix himself played the gormless north-country recruit, Horace Gregory, in both film and throughout the four-year run at the Whitehall, where his reputation for losing his trousers began. He subsequently lost them at least 12,000 times in the 26 years he was on stage in the farces; though he lost them less in the TV plays.", "In the first two years at the Whitehall, Rix's understudy was John Chapman, who also played a small part in Act 3, which ensured a long wait in the dressing room. To occupy his time, he began the first draft of the play that was to follow Heroes. Dry Rot, later filmed, was produced in 1954 with John Slater, Basil Lord and Rix himself in the cast and ran for nearly four years. When Dry Rot went on tour with John Slater in the lead, he was joined by two young actors, Ray Cooney and Tony Hilton."]}, {"page": "Z-Cars", "response": ["| DS Tom Stone || John Slater || 1967\u20131974 || 6\u20139 || 431"]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Siobh\u00e1n McKenna,John Slater,Ronald Hines,Hamilton Dyce,Joby Blanshard,Natalie Kent,Peter Pratt,Judith Arthy,Yemi Ajibade,Dorothy Edwards,Elizabeth Proud,Derek Seaton,Philip Voss"]}, {"page": "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?", "response": ["Record sales in the UK were not a threat to the sheet music charts, broadcast on Radio Luxembourg, until around 1955.

The following month, a version by the British child star Mandy Miller, who was aged just 8, was released. A parody version by American country music duo Homer and Jethro (titled \"That Hound Dog in the Window\") was released in November in the UK, after the song had left the charts.
