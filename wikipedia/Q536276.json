It was released in August 1996 as the first release of the band's own label, Hands on Music, with the catalogue number HMCD01. The album is slightly condensed from the original performance and some songs are presented in a different order. Living Tradition said the album \"stands alone as a showcase for the best of the band's repertoire over the last couple of years.\" Reviewer Graham Gurrin noted \"how well it shows the duo's exceptional abilities as performers. Thinking of Phil Beer as a multi-instrumentalist has become a clich\u00e9, but just listen to him play fiddle on \"The Blind Fiddler\" as if his life depended on it, his elegant cuatro on \"Santiago\" or the subtlety of his slide guitar work on \"The Blue Cockade\". The boy is a genius, and Steve Knightley must have been bathing his tonsils in honey for weeks before the gig. His harmonies with Sally Barker on \"Captains\" should be filed under S for spine-tingling. There is a hint of over-excitement in his voice throughout, which along with the contributions of the various guests gives a bit of an edge to the performances, particularly on stompers like \"The Galway Farmer\" and \"The Hunter\",\" before praising how the album only has three tracks with the band's other live album, both albums having sixteen tracks.", "*Sally Barker - vocals"]}, {"page": "Barrow upon Soar", "response": ["*Sally Barker (born 1959), singer songwriter, of The Poozies, is from Barrow."]}, {"page": "Kevin Hewick", "response": ["During December 2011 and January 2012, Hewick recorded the album All Was Numbered, featuring guests such as Sally Barker and John Butler of Diesel Park West.
