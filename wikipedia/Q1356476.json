Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians describes him as \"the most celebrated British music critic in the first half of the 20th century.\" His style of criticism, aiming at intellectual objectivity in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, such as Neville Cardus, was reflected in his books on Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss and others. He was music critic of The Sunday Times from 1920 until his death nearly forty years later.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
