Among the more significant post-war productions was that directed in 1951 by Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson. At the first Bayreuth Festival after World War II he presented a radical move away from literal representation of the Hall of the Grail or the Flowermaiden's bower. Instead, lighting effects and the bare minimum of scenery were used to complement Wagner's music. This production was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Swiss stage designer Adolphe Appia. The reaction to this production was extreme: Ernest Newman, Richard Wagner's biographer described it as \"not only the best Parsifal I have ever seen and heard, but one of the three or four most moving spiritual experiences of my life\". Others were appalled that Wagner's stage directions were being flouted. The conductor of the 1951 production, Hans Knappertsbusch, on being asked how he could conduct such a disgraceful travesty, declared that right up until the dress rehearsal he imagined that the stage decorations were still to come. Knappertsbusch was particularly upset by the omission of the dove which appears over Parsifal's head at the end of the opera, which he claimed inspired him to give better performances. To placate his conductor Wieland arranged to reinstate the dove, which descended on a string. What Knappertsbusch did not realise was that Wieland had made the length of the string long enough for the conductor to see the dove, but not for the audience. Wieland continued to modify and refine his Bayreuth production of Parsifal until his death in 1966. Martha M\u00f6dl created a \"complex, tortured Kundry in Wieland Wagner's revolutionary production of Parsifal during the festival's first postwar season\", and would remain the company's exclusive Kundry for the remainder of the decade.", "The related question of whether the opera contains a specifically anti-Semitic message is also debated. Some of Wagner's contemporaries and commentators (e.g. Hans von Wolzogen and Ernest Newman) who analysed Parsifal at length, make no mention of any anti-Semitic interpretations.Hans von Wolzogen, Thematic guide through the music of Parsifal: with a preface upon the legendary material of the Wagnerian drama, Schirmer, 1904.Ernest Newman, A study of Wagner, Dobell, 1899. .

Among those conducting their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance (the composer not being present);Jacob, p. 137 during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, \"Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time\". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: \"It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London.\"Newman, Ernest, \"The Case of Arnold Schoenberg\", The Nation, 7 September 1912, p. 830, quoted in Lambourn, David, \"Henry Wood and Schoenberg\", The Musical Times, August 1987, pp. 422\u201327 However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: \"I must say it was the first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands.\"Letter dated 23 January 1914, quoted in Lambourn, David, \"Henry Wood and Schoenberg\", The Musical Times, August 1987, p. 426"]}, {"page": "1868 in music", "response": ["* November 30 \u2013 Ernest Newman, critic (d. 1959)"]}, {"page": "Pseudophilosophy", "response": ["Ernest Newman, an English music critic and musicologist, who aimed at intellectual objectivity in his style of criticism, in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, published in 1897 Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century, a critique of imprecise and subjective writing.", "* Ernest Newman, Pseudo-philosophy at the end of the nineteenth century.

He made dismissive comments about the current standards of musical criticism (\"the average newspaper critic of music ... is either a shipwrecked or worn-out musician, or else a journalist too incompetent for ordinary reporting\") which offended senior critics such as Ernest Newman.

Other critics have praised the psychological realism of the characters, Ernest Newman, for instance, stating that \"Meyerbeer gave his audiences the delighted feeling that they were being brought into touch with real life, and that the characters they saw on the boards were men and women such as they might meet any day themselves.\" The character of Marcel, a creation both textually and musically of Meyerbeer, has met particular praise from critics,evolving as he does from the status of intolerant servant in the first act to that of visionary spiritual guide in the last. Liszt wrote \"The role of Marcel, the purest type of popular pride and religious sacrifice, seems to us to be the most complete and living character.

Meyerbeer also introduced Wagner to Ignaz Moscheles, who was also staying at Boulogne; as Ernest Newman comments, this was \"Wagner's first meeting with real international musical celebrities\".
