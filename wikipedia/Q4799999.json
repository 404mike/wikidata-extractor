He attended alongside other future leading figures in art and design, such as Joseph Highmore, William Kent, and Arthur Pond. However, the academy seems to have stopped operating in 1724, at around the same time that Vanderbank fled to France in order to avoid creditors. Hogarth recalled of the first incarnation of the academy: \"this lasted a few years but the treasurer sinking the subscription money the lamp stove etc were seized for rent and the whole affair put a stop to.\" Hogarth then enrolled in another drawing school, in Covent Garden, shortly after it opened in November 1724, which was run by Sir James Thornhill, serjeant painter to the king. On Thornhill, Hogarth later claimed that, even as an apprentice, \"the painting of St Pauls and gree[n]wich hospital \u2026 were during this time runing in my head\", referring to the massive schemes of decoration painted by Thornhill for the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Greenwich Hospital."]}, {"page": "Bishop Auckland", "response": [" Trevor was unable to secure the 13th, Benjamin, so commissioned Arthur Pond to produce a copy, which hangs alongside the 12 other originals."]}, {"page": "John Dyer", "response": ["In London, Dyer apprenticed himself under the artist Jonathan Richardson.

As a result, Dyer retained such interests and translated his studies into verbal landscape art.Humfrey, Belinda. Writers of Wales \u2013 John Dyer. Ed. Meic Stephens, R, Brinley Jones.

Untitled at the time of issue, it is now known as Characters and Caricaturas or just Characters Caricaturas. At the foot of the picture, Hogarth illustrated the difference between characterisation and caricature by reproducing three character figures from the works of Raphael, and four caricatures: Due Filosofi from Annibale Carracci; a head originally by Pier Leone Ghezzi, but here copied from Arthur Pond's Caricatures; and a Leonardo da Vinci grotesque reproduced from the French T\u00eates de Charact\u00eares.Paulson p.122 The images from Raphael are easy to identify as being from his Cartoons (even if they were not labelled Cartons Urbin Raphael Pinx below) but John Ireland commented that the originals' \"grandeur, elevation and simplicity are totally evaporated\" in Hogarth's rendering.Hogarth p.214 Hogarth also added a line drawing in the space above the second caricature to indicate the simplicity with which caricatures can be produced. Above this demonstration, he filled the remaining space with 100 profiles of \"characters\", which clearly show his work has more in common with the work of Raphael than the caricatures produced by the other Italian artists. Hogarth later wrote that he was careful to vary the features of these heads at random to prevent any of the portraits being identified as a real individual, but the sheer number of profiles inevitably meant this was not entirely successful, since \"a general character will always bear some resemblance to a particular one\".", "Though Hogarth claimed in the inscription to The Bench that \"there are hardly any two things more different\" than character and caricature, modern commentators suggest that his division of the category of comic portraiture, if not artificial, was at least innovative: Hogarth invented the categories merely to be able to place himself in a line of artistic succession that descended from Raphael, and to distance himself from the caricaturists of his day\u2014such as Arthur Pond\u2014who, despite lacking artistic training, were tackling much the same subject matter that Hogarth was himself addressing.Lynch pp.62\u20133"]}, {"page": "George Knapton", "response": ["Knapton's brother, Charles Knapton, born in Christchurch, Hampshire (1700\u20131760), was also an artist and, together with Arthur Pond (1705?\u20131758), published a book Imitations of the Italian Masters (1735), which contained many engravings by himself, mainly of works by Guercino."]}, {"page": "Daniel Wray", "response": ["Between 1722 and 1728 he paid a prolonged visit to Italy in the company of James Douglas.
