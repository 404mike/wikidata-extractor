He was a combative player known for his attacking free kicks and a utility player who excelled in defence, but could play equally well in midfield.\nBlackmore began his professional career at Manchester United in 1982, having progressed through the club's youth ranks. After twelve years and 186 league appearances, he switched to Middlesbrough on a free transfer, and made 53 league appearances in five years, whilst also having a brief loan spell at Bristol City in 1996. Having left Middlesbrough in 1999, he had short spells at Barnsley, Notts County and Leigh RMI over the next couple of seasons, before a much longer stint at Bangor City commenced in 2000. He left Bangor City in 2006 (after a brief stint as player-manager), having made 176 league appearances for the club, and, after spending a season with Porthmadog (where he was also player-manager), switched to Neath Athletic in 2007, where he made a further 22 league appearances before retiring in 2010. Internationally, Blackmore won 39 caps for Wales between 1985 and 1997.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 23", "response": ["*1964 \u2013 Clayton Blackmore, Welsh footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Bangor City F.C.", "response": ["|  Clayton Blackmore", "*  Clayton Blackmore (2000\u201306) 39 Wales caps"]}, {"page": "Porthmadog F.C.", "response": ["Porthmadog announced on 7 May 2007 that their management team\u2014  Osian Roberts  and Viv Williams\u2014were leaving the club.

The Times reporter at the game, Stuart Jones, explained that the match was played primarily for a television audience, and was more of a friendly match for the two sides. Manchester United had the first chance of the game in the second minute, when they were awarded a penalty by the referee, Mario van der Ende; a free kick from the right wing was hit to the far side of the penalty area by Lee Martin, where the ball was met by Gary Pallister, only for his header back across the box to be blocked by the arm of Red Star centre-back Miodrag Belodedici, who received a yellow card for handball. Manchester United captain Steve Bruce placed the penalty kick to the right of Red Star goalkeeper Zvonko Milojevi\u0107, who palmed the ball round the post. United had another chance at goal four minutes later, when Milojevi\u0107 saved a shot from Mark Hughes. Manchester United's attacks in the first half were slow and laboured, rarely piercing Red Star's defence. Meanwhile, the Red Star forwards, Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107 and Darko Pan\u010dev, each broke through the United defence with quick, purposeful attacks. Pan\u010dev just missed the goal with a 20-yard volley, before heading wide from a free kick. Twice, attacks from Savi\u0107evi\u0107 and Pan\u010dev beat United's goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel, but were cleared off the line by Gary Pallister and Clayton Blackmore.
