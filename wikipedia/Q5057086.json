The plan called for insertion of 3 SBS patrols at Hound Bay, who would then travel by land and Gemini inflatable boat across Cumberland East Bay and set up an OP at Brown Mountain overlooking Grytviken. The SAS plan was more ambitious, and called for a helicopter insertion of Mountain Troop, D squadron, on Fortuna Glacier, 20 miles southeast of Stromness. From there the unit would travel across the glacier, and reconnoitre Leith, Husvik, Stromness and East Fortuna bay. The SAS chose Fortuna glacier as a point of entry as it was sufficiently far from expected enemy positions so as to preclude detection, and the Argentines would not expect an attack from that direction. This choice was opposed by officers who had knowledge of local conditions, such as Captain Nick Barker of Endurance and members of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), who felt that the difficulties of travelling on the glacier were being underestimated. However, Major Cedric Delves, officer commanding D squadron, overruled their objections, and as the SAS had strong political backing within the British government, the plan was eventually put into action."]}, {"page": "Jock Stirrup", "response": ["From September 2001 to January 2002, Stirrup was UK National Contingent Commander for Operation Veritas (British operations against the Taliban) in Afghanistan, his first direct experience of front-line operations overseas since 1987.
