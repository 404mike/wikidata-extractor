Then the rhythm machines enter, ensuring that every DJ capable of matching beats could smoothly mix in from the next record if they didn't dare to start with the bare piano. As the track progresses, the sound ebbs and flows as if it had been orchestrated with real instruments, as if disco hadn't died at all. \"I'll take you down, deep down where love lives,\" Limerick growls in a way that doesn't leave any place for doubt.
