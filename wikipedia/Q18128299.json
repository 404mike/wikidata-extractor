A 10-match winless streak ended when the team went on a five-match unbeaten run through November and December 1919. While manager Fred Halliday was able to field a more or less a settled XI, numerous players were tried in the centre forward position before the arrival of Bert Spreadbury in February 1920. Despite scoring four goals in his first five appearances, Spreadbury failed to help the team gain any consistency and Brentford finished the season in 15th position.", "|Bert Spreadbury", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Bert Spreadbury", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Bert Spreadbury", "| Bert Spreadbury"]}]}}
