C. K. Nayudu, Maharajkumar of Vizianagram and Phiroze Palia all played for the Indian team. In 1918 E. Britten-Jones, later to play a controversial role as the manager of the Indian cricket team in England in 1936, took the only hat-trick in the competition. In 1921, CK Nayudu hit 128 before lunch on the first day, an innings that included a famous hit. CK's hit cleared \"the boundary wall at the southern end of the MCC compound \u2013 to land near a coconut tree 50 yards from the MCC grounds. The hit was easily above 150 yards from the batting crease\".Muthiah, p.250, quoting C.
