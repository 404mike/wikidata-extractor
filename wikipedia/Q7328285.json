He has described this as his most difficult time as an engineer. \"I probably lost a half a stone over that period because it was just so intense. I learned a lot from that. Most of all I learned the power of really rigorous engineering analysis in saving lives.\"Parry-Jones has been noted for suggesting that \"building a supercar is much easier than creating excellence for the millions.\" Edmunds.com called Parry-Jones a \"driving dynamics guru\" and Autocar called him \"one of the world's leading automotive engineers.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Network Rail", "response": ["| 2012\u20132015 || Richard Parry-Jones"]}, {"page": "Ford Ka", "response": ["Besides the styling, the Ka, like its sister cars Fiesta and Puma; was lauded in the motoring press for its handling.

The system was developed from that used in the CDW27 Ford Mondeo estate, but with various modifications to make it simpler and cheaper to build and therefore economically viable on a mass-market vehicle."]}, {"page": "List of University of Salford people", "response": ["* Richard Parry-Jones: former group vice president-Global Product Development, and Chief Technical Officer, Ford Motor Company"]}, {"page": "Parry-Jones, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Parry-Jones"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2021", "response": ["*Richard Parry-Jones, 69, British automobile designer (Ford Motor Company).Former Ford engineering boss Richard Parry-Jones dies"]}, {"page": "2021 in Wales", "response": ["**Richard Parry-Jones, engineer and car designer, 69"]}]}}
