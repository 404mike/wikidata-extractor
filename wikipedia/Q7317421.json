His clubs included Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, Bury, Bradford City, Oldham Athletic and Crewe Alexandra. At Bradford he scored 16 goals in 40 games, with all but one of those goals coming in the 1924\u201325 season, when he was club's top goal-scorer, scoring nearly half of its goals, as City struggled in the bottom half of Division Two.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Alcock (footballer)", "response": ["Alcock made his Football League debut on 24 January 1925, standing in for the injured Reuben Butler in the Second Division match at home to Middlesbrough. Bradford City lost 1\u20130, and the Athletic News wrote that Alcock \"proved a strong and forceful player, but both he and Rhodes were too much inclined to rely upon solo efforts.\" He played once more that season, and his next appearance was at the end of October 1925, when he scored in a draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He scored twice in the next fixture, a 3\u20131 win against South Shields, and contributed a goal in each of the next two matches, both wins, that took Bradford City up to seventh in the table. Against Stockport County on 12 December, he fell heavily during the first quarter of the game, damaging his leg so badly that he required knee surgery and was out for the rest of the season. Alcock returned to the league side \"obviously lacking in confidence\" for the first match of the new season, and scored, but was again injured, and did not resume until well into the new year. He finished the season with four goals from just seven matches as Bradford City were relegated, and was not included on their retained list."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Reuben Butler"]}, {"page": "List of Oldham Athletic A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| Div 1 || 42 || 9 || 15 || 18 || 49 || 86 || 33 || 19th || R2 || || || || || Reuben Butler || 16", "| Div 1 || 42 || 13 || 11 || 18 || 38 || 50 || 37 || 19th || R2 || || || || || Reuben Butler || 13"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Reuben Butler||||1924\u20131926||40||16||"]}]}}
