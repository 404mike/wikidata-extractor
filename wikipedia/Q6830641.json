The Committee of Public Safety felt that this mission was so important that it dispatched Lazare Carnot to oversee the operation. Jourdan defeated Coburg on 15\u201316 October at the Battle of Wattignies and broke the siege. Carnot claimed that it was his own intervention that won the victory. Historian Michael Glover writes that the first day's attack was a failure because of Carnot's interference, while the second day's success resulted from Jourdan using his own tactical judgment. In any case, only Carnot's account reached Paris.Glover-Chandler, p 160"]}, {"page": "Robert Wilson (British Army officer, born 1777)", "response": ["* Michael Glover, A Very Slippery Fellow: The Life of Sir Robert Wilson 1777\u20131849, OUP, 1978"]}, {"page": "Second Battle of Porto", "response": ["Historian Michael Glover stated that the order of battle was somewhat different.

He had already seen a dispatch from Lowry Cole to Wellington reporting the Battle of Roncesvalles that day. Cole wrote that he was attacked by 35,000 French soldiers and was obliged to retreat southwards towards Pamplona. With Roncevaux Pass uncovered, Hill ordered Stewart and Barnes to retreat. They slipped away at midnight and marched to Elizondo. The British had been fighting for ten hours so the seriously wounded had to be abandoned and straggling was heavy. That morning, d'Erlon expected another fight, so the French did not pursue until long after sunrise. D'Erlon reported that he had won a victory, but he phrased it in modest tones.

General of Brigade Jean-Louis Dubreton commanded two battalions of the 34th Line Infantry Regiment, one battalion of the 130th Line, one artillery company, one sapper company, nine heavy cannons, 11 field pieces, and six mortars, altogether 2,000 troops. The inner Burgos defenses contained a stronghold known as the Napoleon Battery. Historians differ as to how many heavy guns Wellington had available. Michael Glover wrote that the British had only three 18-pound cannon with 1,306 rounds. David Gates asserted that Wellington only brought eight siege guns though many more recently captured pieces were available. Chris McNab credited the British with having a total of eight 24-pound guns."]}, {"page": "Lou Henson Award", "response": ["* Michael Glover, Iona"]}, {"page": "Manx Regiment", "response": ["* Michael Glover, An Improvised War: The Abyssinian Campaign of 1940\u20131941, London: Leo Cooper, 1987, ."]}]}}
