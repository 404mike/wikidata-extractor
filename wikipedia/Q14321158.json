From 1923 to 1930 he was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, apart from one year in which ill health forced him to study independently at home. He won a scholarship to the School's \"sister foundation\" St John's College, Oxford, where he began the Literae Humaniores course in 1930. His tutor in ancient history was Hugh Last, whose interest in Roman administrative history influenced the direction of his student's later scholarship. Sherwin-White achieved first-class honours in both sets of Oxford examinations, the preliminary Honour Moderations and the more important Finals which he sat in 1934."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Bletchley Park", "response": ["* Hugh Last (Professor of Ancient History at Brasenose College, Oxford)"]}, {"page": "Peter Brunt", "response": ["In 1946, having been released from war-service, he returned to the University of Oxford. He became a Senior Demy (graduate scholar) of Magdalen College, and took up the Craven Fellowship he had been awarded before the war in 1939. There, he undertook research on the influence of Stoicism at Rome under the direction of Professor Hugh Last, and on the relations between governed and governors in the Roman Empire. While studying at the British School at Rome, he came to the belief that archaeological evidence could only be used to confirm something one already knew. In 1947, he was offered a lecturing position. He stopped his doctoral research and took up the appointment of lecturer in Ancient History at the University of St Andrews. He found living in St Andrews difficult as he had to vacate his rooms during the summer months and this disrupted his research."]}, {"page": "Camden Professor of Ancient History", "response": ["# Hugh Last 1936\u20131949"]}, {"page": "History of Brasenose College, Oxford", "response": ["Some members of the governing body, returning in some cases from the war, wished to realign the college with the new national spirit. The principal's considerable role in admissions\u00a0\u2013 which Stallybrass had used to elevate sportsmen\u00a0\u2013  was the subject of criticism and accusations of financial under-performance and over-spending were made. A challenge was made directly in the bringing of a motion calling for a review of Brasenose's financial performance since 1922. However, before it could be debated, Stallybrass was killed, having apparently fallen from a train whilst returning to Oxford from a university meeting in London. Although the possibility of suicide was considered, the coroner ruled the case one of  \"death by misadventure\".Crook (2008). pp.\u00a0379\u2013382.

He struck up friendships with F. W. Walbank (with whom he sometimes collaborated), Ulrich Kahrstedt, F. E. Adcock, Hugh Last and W. B. Anderson. Following the death of S. K. Johnson, he was invited to prepare an edition of books 21 to 40 of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita Libri for the Oxford Classical Texts series. McDonald moved to Australia in 1939 to become Reader in Ancient History at the University of Sydney; there, he was acting Professor of Latin in 1945 and that year was appointed the inaugural Professor of Ancient World History at the university. A highly regarded lecturer, McDonald was also a commentator in broadcasting, edited The Australian Outlook and authored works on Japanese imperialism and international relations in the Pacific region.Hammond (1981), pp. 738\u2013739."]}]}}
