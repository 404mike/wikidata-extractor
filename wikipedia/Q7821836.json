This was initially until the end of the season, but Horton was given the job on a permanent basis in May. He rejuvenated a demoralised side and kept them in the Football League, as they finished seven points clear of the relegation zone in 2003\u201304. Over the summer he signed Iraqi international Jassim Swadi, experienced striker Mike Sheron, veteran defender Tony Barras, left-back Mark Bailey, and Tommy Rooney. He allowed Martin Carruthers to leave, though extended Tommy Widdrington's contract, and offered fresh deals to six others. He later added to his squad by signing Mark Boyd and Simon Weaver; whilst transfer listing Tommy Widdrington and Michael Welch. Many pundits were tipping the \"Silkmen\" to slip out of the newly named League Two at the end of the 2004\u201305 season, but Horton proved the observers wrong as his side were in the top-seven of the division virtually all season long. Horton celebrated his 1000th game as a manager on 3 November 2004, as Macclesfield beat Mansfield 4\u20130 in the Football League Trophy. He also won the League Two Manager of the Month award for February. Macclesfield qualified for the play-offs in sixth place, but their promotion challenge was finally ended by Lincoln City in the semi-finals, following a 2\u20131 aggregate defeat. At the end of the season, Horton released nine players, including club captain Matthew Tipton. In the place of these nine players he signed Kevin Sandwith, Kevin Townson, Martin Bullock, and David Beresford."]}, {"page": "2001 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["The match kicked off around 3p.m. on 27 May 2001 in front of a crowd of 50,496.

It fell to Cureton  out and he volleyed it straight at Jimmy Walker in the Walsall goal.  Walker parried the ball but it rolled into the goal to make it 1\u20130.
