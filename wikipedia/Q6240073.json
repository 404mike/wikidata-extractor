For the glossary committee of the Literary Club he wrote in 1873 a paper on the 'Dialect and Archaisms of Lancashire,' and, in conjunction with George Milner, compiled a 'Glossary of the Lancashire Dialect' (2 parts, 1875\u201382). The Transactions of the Manchester Literary Club began in 1874 and the title was soon changed to the Papers of the Manchester Literary Club which continued to be published until 1991. The founder members of the club included the dialect poets Richard Rome Bealey (1828\u201387), Ben Brierley and Edwin Waugh. Other dialect poets who were members were James Dawson, Junior.

Its fortunes were reversed by the appointment of John Howard Nodal as editor, and the content soon began to reflect his wide-ranging interest in the work being carried out locally in the fields of science, literature, and language. Two of the sections he introduced into the newspaper, \"City News Notes and Queries\" and \"Outdoor Notes: a Journal of Natural History and Out-Door Observation\"\u00a0\u2013 both of which he edited himself\u00a0\u2013 evolved to become independent publications.

It was founded in 1873 with W. W. Skeat as its secretary.  The society's publications were divided into four series: bibliographies, reprinted glossaries, original glossaries and miscellanies.  One unsatisfactory feature of the publications is that they are often arranged by counties whereas dialect boundaries rarely coincide with county boundaries.  Some of the material published by the society was included in Joseph Wright's English Dialect Dictionary.  Collectors of dialect words were discouraged from proposing etymologies on the ground that in so doing they might distort the meaning of the words they were collecting.  In 1876 the society's headquarters was transferred from Cambridge to Manchester where it remained until a further transfer to Oxford in 1893.  The society's library remained at Manchester and was presented to the Manchester Free Library.  It consisted of some 800 books and pamphlets.  John Howard Nodal became honorary secretary and director of the society in 1874.  He continued in office to the dissolution of the society in 1896.  The following year the first of the regional dialect societies in England was founded in Yorkshire. As of October 2021, this still exists as the Yorkshire Dialect Society."]}, {"page": "John Nodal", "response": ["#redirect John Howard Nodal"]}]}}
