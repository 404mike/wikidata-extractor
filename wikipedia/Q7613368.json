Later in the season after getting a throat infection Mariners manager Mike Newell was forced to replace Barnes, and in turn swooped to sign on loan Preston North End keeper Wayne Henderson to replace him. Barnes was then made available for loan, and on 24 March, Newell rejected a loan move from Shrewsbury Town for him after the two clubs could not agree on a deal regarding wages. On 25 March, Barnes left Grimsby after being told he was no longer needed by the club, his understudy Gary Montgomery was also released.

In November 2005, Evans was given a \u00a31,000 fine, suspended for a year, after admitting to using insulting or abusive words to the match official in a match against Peterborough United in October 2005. On 11 February 2006, he was escorted from Grimsby Town's stadium Blundell Park by Humberside Police at half-time, after he berated the fourth official after being incensed when Grimsby goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall appeared to handle the ball outside his area and was immediately spoken to by a police officer after a complaint of alleged foul and abusive language. After the match Boston chairman Jon Sotnick accused the football authorities of waging a \"conspiracy\" against his manager. In October 2006, Evans was linked with the vacant Darlington managerial vacancy, but Boston chairman James Rodwell and Evans both denied the link. Also in October, Evans was sent from the dugout after an altercation with Wycombe Wanderers player Tommy Doherty for which he later received a \u00a31,000 suspended fine from the FA.
