When he was eight years old, Armstrong was sent to a preparatory school in Hanwell under the care of a Dr Bond. He suffered much during this time from rheumatism and delicacy of health and his studies were often interrupted. In 1827, aged 14, he was sent to Charterhouse School. He went in 1832, when nearly 19 years of age, to a private tutor, the Revd James Tweed, of Harlow, Essex, with the view of fitting himself to become a candidate for Lord Crowe's Exhibition at Lincoln College, Oxford. About this time the resolution was formed to devote himself to the ministry. He took a third-class degree in classics in Michaelmas term, 1836. In 1837 he was ordained deacon and commenced his ministry as curate of Alford in Somersetshire.\nArmstrong was consecrated as Bishop of Grahamstown at Lambeth Parish Church on 30 November 1853 (St. Andrew's Day), but he did not reach the Diocese of Grahamstown until the following October.\nArmstrong, who was a man of delicate health, devoted himself to two prime objects. The first was missions to the heathen, which had been completely neglected by the Church. The bishop laid the foundations upon which the missionary work of the diocese and St John's was built. His further object was the successful founding of St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, in 1855, whose dedication commemorates the date of his consecration. But the rough travelling and many anxieties of his diocese were too severe for the bishop's delicate frame and he died on 16 May 1856 after less than two years in the country.He is the author of the hymn text O Thou who makest souls to shine which appears in some of the editions of Hymns Ancient and Modern.His son, Edward, became a noted historian.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Armstrong", "response": ["John Armstrong may refer to:", "*John Armstrong (Australian politician) (1908\u20131977)", "*John Armstrong (New Zealand politician) (1935\u20132018)", "*John Armstrong Jr. (1758\u20131843), soldier and U.S. Secretary of War", "*John Armstrong Sr. (1717\u20131795), American general and Continental Congressman", "*John Armstrong (archbishop of Armagh) (1915\u20131987), Anglican bishop", "*John Armstrong (bishop of Grahamstown) (1813\u20131856), Anglican bishop", "*John Armstrong (bishop of Bermuda) (1905\u20131992), Anglican bishop", "*John Armstrong (priest) (1792\u20131856), Anglican priest in Ireland", "* John Armstrong (cricketer) (born 1981), England", "* John Armstrong (footballer, born 1890) (1890\u20131950), England", "* John Armstrong (footballer, born 1936), Scotland", "* John Armstrong (footballer, born 1987), Scotland", "* John Armstrong (rugby league), Australia", "*John Armstrong (architect) (1857\u20131941), Scotland", "*John Armstrong (artist) (1893\u20131973), UK", "*John Armstrong (British Army officer) (1674\u20131742), Surveyor General", "*John Armstrong (British writer/philosopher) (born 1966)", "*John Armstrong (Carolina) (1735\u20131784), American soldier and land registrar", "*John Armstrong (of Carrick) (1909\u20131984), farmer and musician from Northumberland", "*John Armstrong (comics) (died 2018), British artist", "*John Armstrong (frontiersman) (1755\u20131816), Pennsylvania and Ohio", "*John Armstrong (journalist/poet) (1771\u20131797), Scotland", "*John Armstrong (model railroader) (1920\u20132004), US", "*John Armstrong (physician) (1784\u20131829), England", "*John Armstrong (poet) (1709\u20131779), Scotland", "*John Armstrong (engineer) (1775\u20131854), Britain", "*John Armstrong, New Zealand Army, made calculations for the Te Rata Bridge"]}, {"page": "St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown", "response": ["St. Andrew's College is an Anglican high school for boys located in Makhanda, Eastern Cape province of South Africa.

Archdeacon Merriman had already set the key of missionary enthusiasm, courage, and self-devotion to which the new diocese was tuned. He arrived in Grahamstown in 1848 and his journeys on foot through his huge archdeaconry are famous.

Ill-health prompted Tennant's withdrawal from the project in 1851, and she was succeeded by another widow, 40-year-old Harriet Monsell, who became mother superior of the newly created Community of St John Baptist, Clewer on 30 November 1852.  Soon there were over forty branch houses, and significant work was undertaken in the United States and India. Re-establishment of the religious life was still controversial in Anglicanism (all monasteries and other religious houses had been dissolved during the English Reformation), and the foundation of a sisterhood was viewed with alarm in some quarters, not least among them being the Bishop of Oxford (the diocesan), Samuel Wilberforce, despite his misgivings, he acted as Visitor to the community until his move to Winchester in 1869."]}, {"page": "Anglican Diocese of Mthatha", "response": ["When the Diocese of Grahamstown in the south under Bishop John Armstrong, and Diocese of Natal in the north-east under Bishop John William Colenso were founded, they each included part of an area which in 1872 became the diocese of St John's."]}, {"page": "Keiskammahoek", "response": ["Just outside the town is St Matthew's High School, one of South Africa's historic schools.

A hospital and training facility for nurses was opened at the site in 1923 and the secondary school began in 1926. Like other church schools, the Anglican Church withdrew from direct involvement in the school as a result of the 1953 Bantu Education Act. The state bought much of St Matthews\u2019 land in 1970, and in 1976 the hospital was taken over by the Ciskei government. It closed ten years later, moving to Keiskammahoek, where it became known as the SS Gida Hospital. The high school continues as a state boarding school for girls (with male day students).
