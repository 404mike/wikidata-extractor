He has a place in the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame, as the first Welshman to win the Wales Rally. His first rally was in 1983, and his WRC debut in 1994.

Place of birth is a bit redundant with nationality already mentioned, or the other way around, except in rare cases. Place of death seems trivial to me. While it definitely should be in the article, I don't see the importance of having it in the infobox. Full name starts the biography in bolded letters, and we already have first and last names on top of the box, so I don't see the need to have that one either. The idea with the \"teams\" field is to list all the notable teams in chronological order. Cars indeed don't belong there. About the co-driver field: For example, Petter Solberg's best-known co-driver is Phil Mills, but his current one is Chris Patterson. I just think it would be odd to list Patterson since all of Solberg's wins and almost all podiums are from the period of long partnership with Mills. But you are right that the parameters are optional. Or did you mean you would like to see all notable co-drivers mentioned? I'd definitely oppose that as drivers used to change their co-drivers more often than their socks back in the old days. \"Updated\" field is worth a try. The stats are chronically out-of-date and anons often do partial updates or update from our wrong figures instead of up-to-date ones on juwra.com. We could add it and see how it works on a few articles. I'm not sure what you intend the medal record to be like. Driver's top-three final placings overall and/or in the support categories?
