He was one of three sons to the artists Vladimir (born in the Russian Empire) and Elizabeth Polunin.  All three sons were interested in the natural sciences: Nicholas Polunin (1909\u20131997) was an arctic explorer and environmentalist, and Ivan Polunin (1920\u20132010) was a medical doctor, photographer and ethnographist.\nEducated at Magdalen College, Oxford in biology faculty, Oleg Polunin taught at Charterhouse School in Godalming, Surrey, for over 30 years, later devoting his time to writing popular and authoritative guides to the flora of Europe and the Himalaya. His most well-known work is Flowers of Europe (1969), a classic text for both botanists and general readers. Polunin travelled widely in pursuit of samples and photographs, and he discovered several new species.\nHe was awarded the Linnean Society\u2019s H. H. Bloomer Award in 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Castanea sativa", "response": ["This tree responds very well to coppicing, which is still practised in Britain, and produces a good crop of tannin-rich wood every 12 to 30 years, depending on intended use and local growth rate. The tannin renders the young growing wood durable and weather resistant for outdoor use, thus suitable for posts, fencing or stakes.Oleg Polunin. Trees and Bushes of Britain and Europe. Ed Paladin, 1973, pp. 51, 188 and 195). The wood is of light colour, hard and strong. It is used to make furniture, barrels (sometimes used to age balsamic vinegar), and roof beams notably in southern Europe (for example in houses of the Alpujarra, Spain, in southern France and elsewhere).  The timber has a density of 560\u00a0kg per cubic meter,Chestnut . Niche Timbers. Accessed 19-08-2009. and due to its durability in ground contact is often used for external purposes such as fencing.
