Bullock, Alan et al. 1988. Fontana dictionary of modern thought. 2nd ed. Fontana, London. p. 293 came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: \"The critical point in the evolution of man\u2026 was when he acquired the use of [language]\u2026 Man's development is potentially open\u2026 He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which\u2026 largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change.\"Huxley J.

The first was in 1948\u20131950, when his initial studies produced the first clear X-ray images of DNA, which he presented at a conference in Naples in 1951 attended by James Watson. During the second phase, 1951\u201352, Wilkins produced clear \"B form\" \"X\" shaped images from squid sperm, images he sent to James Watson and Francis Crick, causing Watson to write \"Wilkins... has obtained extremely excellent X-ray diffraction photographs\" [of DNA].Robert Olby; The Path to The Double Helix: Discovery of DNA; p366James D. Watson, The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix p180", "At King's College, Wilkins pursued, among other things, X-ray diffraction work on ram sperm and DNA that had been obtained from calf thymus by the Swiss scientist Rudolf Signer. The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered that it was possible to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns.Wilkins, Maurice HF, 'The Molecular Configuration of Nucleic Acids'.  1962 Nobel lecture, 11 December 1962 Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said \"When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!James D. Watson, The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix p25\" This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson's interest in DNAWilkins, p 138 causing him to write \"suddenly I was excited about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be possible for me to join Wilkins in working on DNA\".James D. Watson, The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix p25-26 At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins \"what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein\".Robert Olby; \"The Path to The Double Helix: Discovery of DNA\"; p354 Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.Wilkins, p 128", "* Robert Olby; \"Wilkins, Maurice Hugh Frederick (1916\u20132004)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn, Oxford University Press, Jan 2008", "* Robert Olby; \"Francis Crick: Hunter of Life's Secrets\", Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, , published in August 2009.", "* Robert Olby; The Path to The Double Helix: Discovery of DNA; first published in October 1974 by MacMillan, with foreword by Francis Crick; ; the definitive DNA textbook, revised in 1994, with a 9-page postscript."]}, {"page": "Sydney Brenner", "response": ["*Robert Olby; Francis Crick: Hunter of Life's Secrets, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, , published on 25 August 2009."]}, {"page": "J.
