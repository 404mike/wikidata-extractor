All we did was sit around, talking politics all the time. So, that couldn't help but find its way into the music. I think there's an angry aspect to the music that directly reflects my feelings at the time.\" Hence after recording tracks with Mirwais, Madonna decided to stop the project and start fresh.

Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2005. Written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price, \"Hung Up\" prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's single \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", for which Madonna personally sought permission from its songwriters, Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus.

Madonna collaborated with Patrick Leonard, Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef and Stuart Price to write new songs, and told Price to pen disco songs that sound like \"ABBA on drugs\".

Billboard described the music as frothy, nonsensical and joyous. The instant familiarity of the sampled music is changed by Stuart Price and Madonna by adding a chugging groove and a chorus which singles it out as an independent song. Alongside the ABBA sample, Rolling Stone said that the song also incorporates elements of Madonna's older songs like \"Like a Prayer\" and \"Holiday\" and features fleeting quotes from bands like S.O.S. and the Tom Tom Club.", "According to Musicnotes.com, \"Hung Up\" is set in common time, and has a moderate dance-beat tempo of 120 beats per minute. The key of the song is in D minor with Madonna's vocal range spanning from the low note of G3 to the high note of B4. The song progresses in the following chord progressions of Dm\u2013F\u2013C\u2013Dm in the verses and Dm\u2013F\u2013Am\u2013Dm in the chorus, and changes to B\u2013F\u2013A\u2013Dm for the bridge. \"Hung Up\" uses the sound of a ticking clock to symbolize fear of wasted time, which was incorporated by composer Stuart Price, from his remix of Gwen Stefani's 2004 single \"What You Waiting For?\".
