McGrain is regarded as one of Scotland's greatest players and throughout the 1970s and 80s as one of the best full backs in world football; sports writer Hugh McIlvanney commented, \"Anybody who saw him at his best had the unmistakable impression of watching a great player, probably one who had no superior anywhere in the world.\"McGrain began his career at Celtic and was one of the \"Quality Street Gang\", a group of young players that emerged in the late 1960s. He progressed to the first team and went on to play 659 competitive games for Celtic between 1970 and 1987, winning seven League Championships, five Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups. He spent his final season of his career with Hamilton, where he helped win them promotion to the Premier Division. McGrain played in the 1974 and 1982 World Cups for Scotland. His 62 caps earned him a place in the Scotland national football team roll of honour and he was inducted to the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2004.\nAfter retiring from playing, McGrain had a spell as manager of Arbroath in the early 1990s, and is now currently part of the coaching staff at Celtic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kenny Dalglish", "response": ["Dalglish signed a professional contract with Celtic in May 1967.

Celtic manager Jock Stein wanted Dalglish to spend a second season at Cumbernauld, but the youngster wanted to turn professional. Dalglish got his wish and became a regular in the reserve team known as the Quality Street Gang, due to it containing a large number of highly rated players, including future Scottish internationals Danny McGrain, George Connelly, Lou Macari and David Hay.

Scotland travelled to Spain in the summer of 1982 in what would be the only occasion Stein would manage a side at the finals of major international tournament. Scotland swept into a 3\u20130 lead in their first group game against New Zealand, but then careless defending saw the Kiwis stage a comeback, scoring twice. Scotland added a further two goals near the end to restore their three-goal advantage, but concern was raised at the potential repercussions of the two New Zealand goals should goal difference become a factor. Brazil were the next opponents, and Stein make a number of changes to his side. Danny McGrain and Kenny Dalglish were surprise omissions, whilst David Narey, Willie Miller and Steve Archibald came into the side. Graeme Souness took over the captaincy in McGrain's absence. Narey gave Scotland a shock lead when he opened the scoring with a powerful right-foot strike. Zico equalised just before half-time from a free kick, and then Brazil took control in the second half, scoring three times to send Scotland crashing to a 4\u20131 defeat. The final group game paired Scotland against the Soviet Union. The teams were level on two points each, but the Soviets had a better goal difference and this meant Scotland had to win. Joe Jordan came into the team for his first appearance at the 1982 World Cup, and he gave Scotland the lead in the first half, but the Soviets rallied and scored twice in the second half. The second goal was particularly galling for the Scots, and came as a result of defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding with one another, allowing Ramaz Shengelia a clear run in at goal to score. Souness netted a late equaliser for Scotland, but the game finished 2\u20132 and Scotland went out on goal difference. Stein commented after the final match: \"I am very disappointed we have not qualified. If we had played the way we did in any other section we would have gone through\", adding \"We have proved we can compete at this level, if not win..... Tonight I think we have done Scotland proud, both on and off the field.\""]}, {"page": "Willie Miller", "response": ["He retired from playing in 1990 due to an injury picked up whilst playing for Scotland. A farewell testimonial match in his honour took place in December 1990 with Aberdeen facing a 'World Cup XI' (featuring Kenny Dalglish, David O'Leary, Mark Hughes and Danny McGrain among others) at Pittodrie Stadium. He had already received a testimonial in 1981 against Tottenham Hotspur."]}, {"page": "Joe Jordan", "response": ["Jordan is described by The Herald as having crossed two eras in his career \u2013 having been a Scottish player at the time they were revered in the English game, he has gone on to coach in England as one of seven Scottish managers or coaches in the Premier League. He attributes this to a common determination and desire to win. In contrast to his playing career, Jordan has lamented the state of the game in Scotland in the late 2000s, which has seen a decline in domestic and international Scottish football, and profile of Scottish players in England, and a drying up of opportunities and even the availability of up and coming local players, contrasted to his era with contemporaries like Asa Hartford, Kenny Dalglish and Danny McGrain."]}]}}
