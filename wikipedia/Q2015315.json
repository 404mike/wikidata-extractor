The Bemrose machine was designed as a rouletting machine. As such, it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a perforating machine by George C. Howard of Toppan Carpenter, stamp printers for the American Government.\"The Bemrose Perforating Machine\", The London Philatelist, February 2009 (Ray Simpson) Both the stroke and rotary processes have been refined since then, but are basically still the ones in use in the 21st century.  The key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes; if too far apart, the stamps will not separate easily, and the stamps are likely to tear, but if too close, the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling. In a few cases the size of the holes has been a factor. In the case of certain stamps produced by Australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets (coil stamps) a pattern can be seen on the stamp's short side of two small, ten large and two small holes."]}, {"page": "Royal Crown Derby", "response": ["From the book Bow, Chelsea, and Derby Porcelain by William Bemrose (1898):"]}, {"page": "Henry Howe Bemrose", "response": ["Bemrose was the first son of William Bemrose, and was educated at Derby School and King William's College, in the Isle of Man.", "He took over as chairman of the family firm of William Bemrose & Sons, printers of Derby and London and was a director of Parr's Derby Bank.
