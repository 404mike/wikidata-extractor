Before this, Grappelli had spent a number of years playing \"cocktail jazz\" in a Paris hotel. After a couple of \"warm up\" gigs in small folk clubs, they played together to an unexpectedly warm reception at the 1973 Cambridge Folk Festival with Denny Wright on second acoustic guitar. This began a collaboration between Grappelli and the Diz Disley Trio, sometimes billed The Hot Club of London, with tours of Australia, Europe, and the United States. Karl Dallas reported Disley as having \"single-handedly created a revival of interest in the music of Stephane Grappelli, which has taken him to Carnegie Hall, Australia, and New Zealand\" (the latter in September 1974). \"...the night he closed at the Palladium, he went to The Troubadour where he was booked later that night to perform his folk club act of idiocy and mayhem, keeping up the tradition he has built up over the past 20 years for delivering a shrewd mixture of musical brilliance and vocal insanity.\"Karl Dallas, Melody Maker, July 27, 1974, \"Disley - still making whoopee\" There were a few changes in line-up with Ike Isaacs, Louis Stewart, and John Etheridge alternating as second guitarist. The Disley Trio accompanied Grappelli for another five years until Disley was forced to take a break in 1979 after breaking his wrist when he was knocked down by a motorcycle in London. His replacement was a young Martin Taylor, who toured with Grappelli for ten years. During that period, Disley continued to play folk clubs and festivals as a solo performer and also mentored a young Chris Newman, who would establish his own name in the swing jazz, guitar flatpicking and celtic folk guitar fields.", "Disley was very much a one-off \"character\" and remembered for his personality traits and eccentricities. Contributors talk of his chaotic life. He had the ability to make large sums of money and then be completely penniless. He drove and slept in a Rolls Royce hearse with a sack of carrots and a juicer, believing that carrot juice would offset the effects of alcohol. He arrived at clubs and discovered he got the week of his performance wrong. He frequently arrived at folk clubs without his guitar, borrowing one from the audience, upon which he would play quite unaffected by any instrumental inadequacies. He addressed most people he met as \"Dear Boy\". His most frequent request was for an advance on his fee or to cash a check for the same purpose, which he would refer to in slang as \"sausage me a gregory\": sausage and mash for \"cash\", Gregory Peck for \"check\". David \"Brillo\" Etheridge (double bass) and Chris Newman (guitar) have spoken highly of his mentoring and sharing of his musical knowledge at formative stages in their careers."]}, {"page": "Chris Newman", "response": ["Chris Newman may refer to:", "*Chris Newman (sound engineer) (born 1940), Academy Award-winning sound mixer and director", "*Chris Newman (footballer) (born 1982), Australian rules footballer for the Richmond Football Club (AFL)", "*Chris Newman (artist) (born 1958), composer, author and performance artist", "*Chris Newman (actor) (born 1987), Irish actor from the show Aisling's Diary", "*Chris Newman (musician) (born 1953), American songwriter, singer, guitarist, recording artist", "*Chris Newman (guitarist) (born 1952), British guitarist and songwriter", "*Chris Newman (field hockey) (born 1990), British field hockey player"]}, {"page": "Nollaig Casey", "response": ["She also performed frequently with her husband guitarist Arty McGlynn, and performs with her sister harpist M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Chathasaigh and guitarist Chris Newman."]}]}}
