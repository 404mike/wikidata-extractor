In 1898, she toured Australia. She also was active in oratorio in Britain. On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albani travelled to London and sang the solo role at her final service. In spring 1908, the veteran Albani toured the English provinces as part of a company containing two budding talents: pianist Marie Novello, who two years later would become one of Theodor Leschetizky's last students, and John McCormack, who only months before had made his own Covent Garden debut. Albani gave her last public performance on 14 October 1911. That same year she released a book, Forty Years of Song. The book was effectively a memoir, recounting stories of her youth, travels and career, and impressions of fellow performers and the royalty she met over her life, as well as providing some useful advice on singing."]}, {"page": "Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565", "response": ["Tausig's version of the work was recorded on piano rolls several times in the first decades of the 20th century.The Aeolian Company (recording)Bloomfield Zeisler 1912 (recording) In the mid-1920s, Marie Novello recorded the Tausig piano version of BWV 565 on 78\u00a0rpm discs.Novello 1926 (recording) Percy Grainger's 1931 recording on the piano, based on the Tausig and Busoni transcriptions, was written out as a score by Leslie Howard, and then recorded by other artists.Piers Lane, Liner notes  to Bach Piano Transcriptions \u2013 3: Ignaz Friedman / Percy Grainger / William Mudoch.
