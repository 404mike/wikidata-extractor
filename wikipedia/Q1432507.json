Other scholars argue that the primary stimulus for agriculture and domesticated animals (as well as mud-brick architecture and other Neolithic cultural features) in Egypt was from the Middle East."]}, {"page": "October 23", "response": ["*1946 \u2013 Graeme Barker, English archaeologist and academic"]}, {"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*Graeme Barker (born 1946) British; Italian Bronze Age, Roman Libya, landscape archaeology"]}, {"page": "Disney Professor of Archaeology", "response": ["* 2004\u20132014 Graeme Barker"]}, {"page": "University of Leicester", "response": ["The School of Archaeology and Ancient History was formed in 1990 from the then Departments of Archaeology and Classics, under the headship of Graeme Barker.
