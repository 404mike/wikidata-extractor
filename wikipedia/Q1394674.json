Suarez played very well in his debut season, starting 19 games while scoring 2 goals and 3 assists, and showing an attacking instinct and physicality that looked to make him very dangerous in Major League Soccer.  Although Suarez played consistently in his second season, starting 24 games and recording a goal and 2 assists for the Burn, his lack of improvement troubled many.  His third season brought a move to center back, which Suarez did not take happily to \u2013 in midseason, he was traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy with Paul Broome and Antonio Mart\u00ednez in exchange for Ezra Hendrickson and Gavin Glinton.  Suarez's time with the Galaxy was limited by injuries, playing only 3 games.  In his fourth season, with Galaxy star defender Danny Califf out for much of the year, Suarez cemented a position in the Galaxy back line, registering 25 starts for the team, but not scoring a single point. Suarez's efforts earned him the respect of Galaxy supporters and even brought him the LA Riot Squad (LARS) Player of the Year Award.  Chivas USA acquired Suarez before the 2005 season."]}, {"page": "Tim Regan", "response": ["Regan played college soccer at Bradley University from 1999 to 2002, where he established himself as one of the best players in the program's history.

Regan was moved to defense as a junior, and proved more than up to the task - he finished the year as a first-team All-MVC winner, and the team's co-MVP with Gavin Glinton.  Regan remained at defense as a senior and performed even better, winning MVC Defensive Player of the Year while being instrumental in the team posting a 0.81 goals against average."]}, {"page": "Turks and Caicos Islands national football team", "response": ["|align=left|Gavin Glinton", "|align=\"left\"|Gavin Glinton"]}, {"page": "Paul Broome", "response": ["In 2002, Broome started all twenty-five games he played as a left back, registering four assists.
