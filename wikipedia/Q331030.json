The line-up went through months of personnel changes, notably no fewer than four drummers before settling on Aynsley Dunbar and switching Wood to bass. This line-up spent most of 1967 playing the UK club circuit and appeared several times on BBC Radio.

By early 1968 the band was ready to throw in the towel, and again to his credit, Grant convinced them not to break up, and booked a short US tour for them. Beck is quoted as saying \"We were literally down to one change of clothing each\". Grant's first stop for them was in New York City, for four shows at Fillmore East, where they played second on the bill to the Grateful Dead. They apparently took the town by storm. The New York Times ran the Robert Shelton article: \"Jeff Beck Group Cheered in Debut\", with the byline \"British Pop Singers Delight Fillmore East Audience\" proclaiming that Beck and his group had upstaged the Grateful Dead.
