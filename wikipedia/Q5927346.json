The meeting was held in London and had been convened to explore every conceivable way in which the German forces may attempt an invasion of Ireland. At the meeting were Joseph Walshe, Irish secretary of External Affairs, Colonel Liam Archer of Irish Military Intelligence (G2), and officers from the Royal Navy, British Army, and the Royal Air Force.  The War Office wanted direct liaisons between the Irish military authorities in Dublin and the British General Officer Commanding in Belfast. Walshe and Archer therefore agreed to fly in secret to Belfast with Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Clarke.Dudley was a British staff officer who had practical experience of the failed British attempt to conquer Norway and the subsequent evacuation Operation Alphabet. In Belfast, two British Army staff officers were collected and the group travelled back to Dublin by rail. This meeting was held underneath Government buildings in Kildare Street and included a number of Irish Army officers. The meeting was informed that General Sir Hubert Huddleston, the General Officer Commanding (GOC.) Northern Ireland, was already under orders to take a mobile column south of the border to help the Irish Army if the Germans invaded.Huddleston was awaiting the command from London."]}, {"page": "Headquarters Northern Ireland", "response": ["*Major-General Hubert Huddleston 1940"]}, {"page": "Sudan Defence Force", "response": ["*Major-General Hubert Huddleston:            1925-March 1930 "]}, {"page": "Huddleston", "response": ["* Hubert Huddleston (1880\u20131950), British Army officer"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*1946: 1st Baron Alness, Edward Appleton, Thomas Barlow, Muhammad Ahmad Said Khan Chhatari, Douglas Evill, Henry French, Alexander Hood, Maurice Holmes, Harold Howitt, Hubert Huddleston, 1st Baron Iliffe, John Kennedy, Arthur Power, Charles Kennedy-Purvis, Henry Peat, Thomas Williams Phillips, Hubert Rance, Bernard Rawlings, James Somerville, 1st Viscount Slim, 1st Baronet Thomson, Maharaja of Tripura"]}, {"page": "List of Old Felstedians", "response": ["* General Sir Hubert Huddleston (1880\u20131950), colonial administrator (ODNB)"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Bedford School", "response": ["*Major General Sir Hubert Huddleston GCMG GBE CB DSO MC (1880\u20131950), Commandant, Sudan Defence Force and General Officer Commanding, Sudan, 1925\u20131930, and Governor-General of the Sudan, 1940\u20131947"]}, {"page": "Hubert Jervoise Huddleston", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hubert Huddleston"]}, {"page": "Governor Huddleston", "response": ["*Hubert Huddleston (1880\u20131950), Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan from 1940 to 1947"]}]}}
