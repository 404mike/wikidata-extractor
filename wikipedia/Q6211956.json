This was the last FA Cup Final to be played at Kennington Oval due to the Surrey Cricket authorities becoming increasingly alarmed at the large crowds now being attracted to the main game in the footballing calendar.  Albions form throughout the league season had been erratic and Villa supporters felt that all they had to do was turn up and the cup was theirs for the taking.Taken from 'West Bromwich Albion: A Complete Record by Tony Matthews (1993)  West Bromwich Albion won 3\u20130, with goals by Alfred Geddes, Sammy Nicholls and Jack Reynolds.  Villa began brightly on a warm, sunny day which helped swell the attendance to almost 33,000, but Albion had an early surprise in store and after just 4 minutes took the lead.  Villa fought back hard but they found the Albion keeper Joe Reader in tremendous form.  Albion then made it 2-0 on the 27 minute mark and 10 minutes into the 2nd half, Villa's last hopes disappeared when Albion went 3 up.

The final was played for the first time at Crystal Palace, which was to host the finals for the next twenty years. The weather for the final was described as \"a beautiful spring day\", and consequently the crowd and press were still coming into the ground when the game kicked off. From the kick-off, John Devey, the Villa centre-forward, swung the ball out to his inside-left, Dennis Hodgetts.

In the final itself, played at Crystal Palace against local rivals Aston Villa, Villa took a first-minute lead when Bob Chatt's shot was half saved by goalkeeper Joe Reader and John Devey bundled the ball over the line.

He failed to settle in the North East, enduring homesickness as well as his wife's illness. On the pitch however, he helped Sunderland Albion finish as runners-up in the Football Alliance and was ever-present in the league. He returned to West Bromwich Albion on another free transfer in May 1891, and was initially given his place back, at the expense of Joe Reader. By this time however, Roberts' wife was seriously ill and she died in October 1891. Goalkeeping duties were alternated, and as Roberts' form declined further, Reader won his place back permanently. Roberts thus played no part in Albion's 1892 FA Cup Final win over Aston Villa, and left Albion to join Villa at the end of the season, again for no transfer fee. Villa director William McGregor said that Roberts was \"Unquestionably the finest goalkeeper of his time\". After playing in just four games for Villa, Roberts retired from playing football in June 1893. He moved back to the North East, where he settled for the remainder of his life, working as a plasterer, and died in Byker on 20 October 1929."]}, {"page": "Josiah Reader", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Reader"]}, {"page": "Sandy Lang", "response": ["Alexander Lang (1864 \u2013 8 November 1901) was a Scottish professional footballer who played as a full back. He came to Burnley from Padiham in 1885 and was one of the club's regular full-backs, operating on the left or right side, as well as being the club captain, when Football League came to Turf Moor in 1888. He was born at Bridge of Weir, near Paisley, in 1864 and came south of the border to join Padiham as a 20-year-old in 1884. He brought with him a reputation as a versatile player but it was as a hard-tackling defender that he made his name. He missed only eight League games in the first seasons of League football and was the first Burnley player to complete 100 games for the club, in March 1893. The only two goals of his League career came in the previous season and the second was the club's first\u2013ever from a penalty\u2013kick, in a 3\u20132 win against West Bromwich Albion on 28 November 1891. The keeper Lang beat that day was Joe Reader, later to play for England. He played his last League game in March 1895 and became a publican in Burnley, although he later resumed his playing career, assisting Nelson to the Lancashire League Championship. He sustained fatal injuries in an accident at his home and died on 9 November 1901, aged 37."]}]}}
