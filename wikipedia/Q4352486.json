In \"The Adventure of Black Peter\", Dr. Watson records that Sherlock Holmes could assume various disguises in \"at least five small refuges\" which he had in different parts of London; Vincent Starrett wrote that Mycroft's residence \"would certainly be one of them\".Klinger, Leslie (ed.). The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume II (New York: W. W. Norton, 2005). p. 979.  Ronald A. Knox suggested that Mycroft was a double agent who assisted both Sherlock and Professor Moriarty, with the goal of ultimately betraying Moriarty and members of his gang, including Colonel Moran.Klinger, Leslie (ed.). The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, Volume II (New York: W. W. Norton, 2005). p. 801.  June Thomson theorised that Mycroft nominated Sherlock to infiltrate the German spy ring in \"His Last Bow\" (set in 1914) and might have persuaded Sherlock to come out of retirement. Thomson calculated that Mycroft would have retired himself in 1912 at the age of sixty-five years old, but would have maintained his connections with former colleagues in the government.Klinger, Leslie (ed.).

Generally speaking, this particular realm of fantasy employs either a Victorian or Edwardian setting. The gaslamp fantasy genre is not to be confused with steampunk, which is often set in the same historical era but usually has more of a super-science edge and uchronic tone. Gaslamp fantasy also differs from classical Victorian/Edwardian faerie or pure fantasy in the J.R.R. Tolkien or Lewis Carroll style or from historical crime-novels in the Anne Perry or June Thomson style by the supernatural elements, themes, and subjects it features. Many of its tropes, themes, and stock characters derive from Gothic literature\u2014a long-established genre composed of both romantic and horrific traits and motivated by the desire to rouse fear, apprehension, and other intense emotions within the reader\u2014and could be described as an attempt to modernize literary Gothicism."]}, {"page": "List of biographical dictionaries of women writers in English", "response": ["**entries for: Catherine Aird, Margery Allingham/Maxwell March, Charlotte Armstrong/Jo Valentine, Margot Arnold, Marian Babson, Nikki Baker, Linda Barnes, J.
