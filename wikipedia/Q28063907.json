First described by Woese and Fox in a 1977 paper and explored further with microbiologist Jane Gibson in a 1980 paper, these organisms, or progenotes, were imagined as protocells with very low complexity due to their error-prone translation apparatus (\"noisy genetic transmission channel\"), which produced high mutation rates that limited the specificity of cellular interaction and the size of the genome. This early translation apparatus would have produced a group of structurally similar, functionally equivalent proteins, rather than a single protein. Furthermore, because of this reduced specificity, all cellular components were susceptible to horizontal gene transfer, and rapid evolution occurred at the level of the ecosystem."]}, {"page": "Newnham College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Jane Gibson"]}, {"page": "Friday Night, Saturday Morning", "response": ["| 19 March 1982 || Diana Quick || Jane Gibson, Merry Conway, Jay Geary e, Victoria Wood, The Great Soprendo, Bill Campbell, Jacko Fossett, Colin Harper, Sarah Mortimer"]}, {"page": "No Commitments", "response": ["|5||Spreading Wings||11 August 1999||the secretary \u2013 Jane Gibson, the waiter \u2013 Alan Cowan"]}, {"page": "The Maynard School", "response": ["*Jane Gibson, biochemist and professor at Cornell University"]}, {"page": "Phil Sawdon", "response": ["Sawdon was a member of the UK\u2019s National Association of Ceramics in Higher Education (NACHE), by whom he was invited onto the organising committee of association\u2019s second triennial exhibition Ceramic Contemporaries 2, chaired by Jane Gibson (1996).
