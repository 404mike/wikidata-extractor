Leagas was a founding member of Death In June. After leaving Death In June in 1985 during a tour in Italy, Leagas formed Sixth Comm in 1986 and began working under the name Patrick O-Kill. Sixth Comm frequently collaborated with the Dutch neopagan Freya Aswynn and expressed neopagan themes. Leagas later met vocalist Amodali at a Liverpool club in 1989. The two collaborated extensively in the 1990s as Mother Destruction, which released five albums with pagan themes and influences from electronic dance music. After this, Leagas left music for a period of time when he focused on family life and lived abroad. He returned to music with a double album with Sixth Comm in 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nada!", "response": ["* Patrick Leagas"]}, {"page": "Tony Wakeford", "response": ["Wakeford was the bassist for the English political punk band Crisis from 1977 until the band's termination in 1980. Crisis played many concerts for Rock Against Racism and the Anti-Nazi League reflecting Wakeford's then membership of the Socialist Workers Party. He was briefly a member of The Runners From 84, a band started by Patrick Leagas. He then formed Death in June with Crisis guitarist Douglas Pearce and Leagas. This collaboration came to end both due to musical differences and because of Wakeford's membership at the time of the British National Front. Wakeford was asked to leave Death in June in early 1984, with the album Burial documenting his last contributions. He then formed the controversial post punk act Above The Ruins who recorded one album, Songs of the Wolf. After disbanding Above The Ruins, Wakeford formed Sol Invictus in 1987. This period also marked in his own words his departure from right-wing politics. In 2007 Wakeford stated that he has had no connection or interest in such ideas for 20 or more years and has described his membership as \"probably the worse [sic] decision of my life and one I very much regret\"."]}, {"page": "Patrick O-Kill", "response": ["#redirect Patrick Leagas"]}, {"page": "Freya Aswynn", "response": ["Aswynn recorded the album Fruits of Yggdrasil (1987) with Patrick Leagas' project Sixth Comm and they have performed together in what they regard as both music concerts and religious rituals. She can be heard performing her own rune chants on Current 93's album Swastikas for Noddy (1988). According to Aswynn, Hilmar was a friend of Tibet and a neopagan leader in Iceland, and when he visited her house she decided to \"show off\" by chanting runes; Hilmar suggested that Tibet should record her chanting, which he did. Death in June used Aswynn's invocations against the British government as the opening of many live performances.

Pearce and Wakeford had been members of the political punk band Crisis, which formed in 1977. Crisis had gained a substantial following in the UK punk subculture. Crisis performed at rallies for The Right to Work, Rock Against Racism, and the Anti-Nazi League.", "The Nada! (1985) LP introduced a temporary dance sound to Death in June accompanied by other tracks with the previously introduced folk elements.
