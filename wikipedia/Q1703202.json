Kocher then proceeded to start a journey through Europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time. It is not clear how Kocher financed his trip but according to Bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female Suisse romande philanthropist who also supported his friend Marc Dufour and was probably a member of the Moravian Church. In October 1865, he traveled to Berlin, passing through Leipzig and visiting an old friend from high school, Hans Blum. In Berlin, he studied under Bernhard von Langenbeck and applied for an assistant position with Langenbeck and Rudolf Virchow. Since there was no position available, in April 1867 Kocher moved on to London where he first met Jonathan Hutchinson and then worked for Henry Thompson and John Erichsen. Furthermore, he was interested in the work of Isaac Baker Brown and Thomas Spencer Wells, who also invited Kocher to go to the opera with his family. In July 1867, he traveled on to Paris to meet Auguste N\u00e9laton, Auguste Verneuil and Louis Pasteur. During his travels, he did not only learn novel techniques but also got to know leading surgeons in person and learned to speak English fluently which allowed him later on to follow the scientific progress in the English speaking world with ease."]}, {"page": "1913", "response": ["** Sir Jonathan Hutchinson, English surgeon (b. 1828)"]}, {"page": "1828", "response": ["* July 23 \u2013 Sir Jonathan Hutchinson, English physician (d. 1913)"]}, {"page": "Progeria", "response": ["Progeria was first described in 1886 by Jonathan Hutchinson.

In 1855, he published a study in which he compared the rate of contraction of venereal disease amongst the gentile and Jewish population of London. Although his manipulation and usage of the data has since been shown to have been flawed (the protection that Jews appear to have are more likely due to cultural factors), his study appeared to demonstrate that circumcised men were significantly less vulnerable to such disease. (A 2006 systematic review concluded that the evidence \"strongly indicates that circumcised men are at lower risk of chancroid and syphilis.\")", "In the 19th century the role of the foreskin in erotic sensation was well understood by physicians who wanted to cut it off precisely because they considered it the major factor leading boys to masturbation. The Victorian physician and venereologist William Acton (1814\u20131875) damned it as \"a source of serious mischief\", and most of his contemporaries concurred. Both opponents and supporters of circumcision agreed that the significant role the foreskin played in sexual response was the main reason why it should be either left in place or removed. William Hammond, a Professor of Mind in New York in the late 19th century, commented that \"circumcision, when performed in early life, generally lessens the voluptuous sensations of sexual intercourse\", and both he and Acton considered the foreskin necessary for optimal sexual function, especially in old age. Jonathan Hutchinson, English surgeon and pathologist (1828\u20131913), and many others, thought this was the main reason why it should be excised."]}, {"page": "Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland", "response": ["* John Eric Erichsen, Jonathan Hutchinson (1887)"]}, {"page": "John Hutchinson", "response": ["*Jonathan Hutchinson (1828\u20131913), English doctor"]}, {"page": "Hull York Medical School", "response": ["The early history of medical education in Hull and York goes back to the three following institutions: Hull Medical School (1831), York Medical Society (1832) and the York Medical School (1834).
