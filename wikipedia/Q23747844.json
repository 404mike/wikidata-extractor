Under the Family Law Amendment Act 2006, a court requires a certificate of attendance from Family Dispute Resolution Services that states both parents attended a compulsory mediation session before it can hear a case relating to the custody of a child. While there are exemptions for cases with accusations of family violence, the Australian Law Reform Commission stated in its inquiry into the 2006 Family Law Amendment Act that the family dispute resolution process is \"weighted heavily\" against women, particularly those who have been victims of domestic abuse, leading to women being \"manipulated into agreeing with unjust settlements\". The 2006 Family Law Amendment Act also includes a specification that the presumption of shared parental responsibility means the Family Court is obliged \"to consider\" implementing a custody arrangement that grants both parents equal time or \"substantial and significant time\", which has been critiqued by the Australian Law Reform Commission and was not amended in the 2011 Family Law Legislation Amendment Act. The Australian Law Reform Commission has claimed that this specification has created \"widespread misunderstanding\", leading parents to believe that children must spend equal or significant time with both parents. Child protection campaigner Emeritus Professor Freda Briggs has stated that the child being protected from harm \"must be elevated to the single primary and paramount consideration\", otherwise the \"risk of ongoing exposure to domestic violence\" will remain."]}, {"page": "2005 Queen's Birthday Honours (Australia)", "response": ["| Freda Briggs|| For service to raising community and professional awareness of child abuse and neglect and as an advocate for effective child safety education programs."]}]}}
