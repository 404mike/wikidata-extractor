Greenhough had nothing like the spin of Wright or Jenkins, but could disguise his googly exceptionally well, although he bowled from a quite long run-up for a slow bowler. During 1959 and 1960, Greenhough formed an extremely valuable complement to Brian Statham \u2013 at the time probably the greatest post-war English bowler \u2013 but for the remainder of his career a succession of injuries, and form lapses, prevented him reaching the potential those two seasons suggested.\nCricket writer, Colin Bateman, commented that \u201cit was amazing that Tommy Greenhough played Test cricket at all. As a young player with Lancashire, he took a job in a cotton mill during the winter and fell from a gantry. Both ankles were badly broken and his feet ended up different sizes\u201d. Bateman went on \u201che overcame his handicap to become one of the most inventive leg-break bowlers in the country, performing well when called up in 1959. He could, however, lose confidence, as happened on the 1960 tour of the West Indies, where he did not play a Test\u201d.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["With the retirement of Nigel Howard in 1954, Lancashire appointed its first professional captain, Cyril Washbrook, who would captain the club for the next six years. In 1954 Geoff Pullar, Ken Grieves and Alan Wharton all scored over 2,000\u00a0runs, whilst Brian Statham, Ken Higgs and Tommy Greenhough all took over 100\u00a0wickets; despite this, Lancashire managed to finish only 5th. Lancashire came close to reclaiming the county championship in 1960 under a new captain, Bob Barber. Five batsmen scored more than 1,000\u00a0runs in the season, and Statham, Higgs and Greenhough all took over 100\u00a0wickets; Lancashire finished runner up due to a poor run of form towards the end of the season: losing four and drawing two of the last six matches after topping the table in August. The following year, however, Lancashire dropped to 13th, due in part to Barber's inexperience and Statham's and Geoff Pullar's England commitments. Things declined further in 1962, under the leadership of Joe Blackledge, who had had no previous first-class experience, as Lancashire dropped to second last, winning only two matches. After a period of unrest, Brian Statham was appointed captain between 1965 and 1967 and Lancashire's results improved. Statham retired in 1968 with 1,816 first-class wickets, a record for the club.

However, Evans remained and in the first Test of the summer he justified his selection with a run-a-ball innings of 73, which contained 12 boundaries. Norman Preston in Wisden described it as 'daring hitting' which 'reduced the hitherto keen Indian bowling to a thing of shreds and patches'. In the second Test at Lord's Evans missed four stumpings off Tommy Greenhough in the space of a quarter of an hour, he otherwise kept well and didn't concede a bye in the match. Evans was dropped from the team for the next Test 'in the interests of team building', the reason given by the selectors. His England test cap number is 315."]}, {"page": "Bob Barber (cricketer)", "response": ["Hampered by an intrusive committee and hostile crowd,WISDEN 1960-2 Barber was perceived as not making the best of his own abilities, particularly as a leg spinner, though in a team boasting Test leg spinner Tommy Greenhough and useful allrounders in Grieves and Booth, both of whom were wrist spinners, Barber found it difficult to earn a place. He was replaced by Joe Blackledge in 1962, who met with no greater success as the county endured a difficult season. Joining Warwickshire, Barber was encouraged to play his shots and began to play regularly for England as an opening batsman. His greatest innings, and his only Test century, was made in the Third Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1965\u201366. He made 185 off 255 balls and added 234 in even time with Geoff Boycott for the first wicket. It remains the highest score by an Englishman on the opening day of an Ashes Test. E.W.

However, in 1957, he lost accuracy and was frequently left out in favour of Tommy Greenhough. He came back with 94 wickets in 1958, including a career best 8 for 19 against the New Zealanders. His younger brother Jim played a few times for Lancashire, and more often for Somerset. At Weston-super-Mare in 1956, Malcolm Hilton took 14 Somerset wickets and Jim Hilton responded with eight Lancashire victims."]}, {"page": "Geoff Pullar", "response": ["Pullar was born in Swinton, Lancashire, in 1935, and was a product of Werneth Cricket Club, which was close to where he went to school in Oldham; while there he showed equal talent as a leg break bowler as well as with his batting \u2013 but with Tommy Greenhough, Bob Barber and Sonny Ramadhin variously based at Old Trafford, Pullar's bowling was rarely called upon in first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "Roy Tattersall", "response": ["Tattersall, however, bowled in excellent form for Lancashire right up to 1957; taking 100 County Championship wickets every year except 1956, when after an irresistible start, he unaccountably lost form. In the wet summer of 1958. he failed to reach 100 wickets for the first time since 1949. The eminent Lancashire cricket writer, John Kay,Cricketer Spring Annual 1959 felt Tattersall the victim of inconsistent policy at Old Trafford. In 1956, he was left out in mid-season, a move that probably cost the County the championship.Cricketer Winter Annual 1956 Nonetheless, it was a surprise to see Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton dropped at the beginning of 1959, for the leg-spinner Tommy Greenhough.

India began very slowly, and Tommy Greenhough, in his first Test also, conceded 16 runs in his first 16 overs, also taking the first wicket, that of Contractor. Two wickets for Fred Trueman were followed by late rain, and on the third day Borde was unable to resume his innings, having broken a finger the previous evening. India's batting, with Nadkarni also handicapped by injury, subsided against hostile bowling from Trueman, Brian Statham and Alan Moss, and the innings of 206 took 375 minutes and 102.5 overs. Only Roy reached 50, and in the follow-on he made a further 49. But apart from Manjrekar (44), Gaekwad (31) and Umrigar (20) no other batsman reached double figures, and Borde was unable to bat.
