They faced Larne in the semi-final and secured an early lead, through a goal from Daniel Purkis in the opening minutes of the game, only for Larne to equalise a few minutes later. Both sides battled to secure a win, with Martin Donnelly scoring the winning goal for Larne in injury time, leaving Glenavon without European qualification."]}, {"page": "Ken Oman", "response": ["In February 2015, free agent Oman joined NIFL Premiership side Portadown on an 18-Month Contract.
