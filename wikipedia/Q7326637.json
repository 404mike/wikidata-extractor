Notts County started to come back into the match; Martindale headed wide, Agana and Richardson both had shots blocked during a goalmouth scramble and Tony Battersby had a shot saved over the crossbar by Jonathan Gould, as County tried to equalise during a 20-minute spell of pressure. Between County's chances, Stallard had the opportunity to double City's lead when he capitalised on a slip from Strodder, but Ward saved his effort. However, City went on to double their advantage on 75 minutes. Ormondroyd, who had replaced the injured Hamilton, flicked on a long pass from Richard Huxford with his first touch. His header went across goal to Stallard who volleyed home. Two minutes after the goal, Martindale fired wide for County after a pass from Agana, and with time running out Finnan's long-range shot was deflected for a corner, but from the resulting set-piece, Richardson shot over the crossbar.", "|RB ||2||  Richard Huxford"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Richard Huxford *"]}, {"page": "Huxford", "response": ["*Richard Huxford (born 1969), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Huxford, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Huxford"]}]}}
