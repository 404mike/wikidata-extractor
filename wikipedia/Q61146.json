In this way, Outward Bound was engaging in a form of adventure therapy \u2013 intervening in the lack of tenacity through the use of challenging adventure training.", "Adventure therapy theory draws from a mixture of learning and psychological theories. The learning theories include contributions from Albert Bandura, John Dewey, Kurt Hahn, and Kurt Lewin.
