The 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately.  The first major advancement in this century came during the 1930s with the invention of a spectrometer that could measure the signal produced with infrared (IR) light.  Early IR spectrometers used a monochromator and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band.  It was not until the coupling of an interferometer with an IR spectrometer in 1949 by Peter Fellgett that the complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once.  Fellgett also used the Fourier transform, a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies, to make sense of the enormous amount of data received from the complete infrared analysis of a material.  Since then, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments have become critical in the forensic analysis of unknown material because they are nondestructive  and extremely quick to use.  Spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with the invention of the modern atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer by Alan Walsh.  AA analysis can detect specific elements that make up a sample along with their concentrations, allowing for the easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2008", "response": ["*Peter Fellgett, 86, British physicist.Peter Berners Fellgett FRS, FIEE"]}, {"page": "Peter Berners Fellgett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Fellgett"]}, {"page": "R.
