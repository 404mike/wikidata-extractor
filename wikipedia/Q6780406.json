In the early 20th century, traditional and historical dances began to be revived in England. Neal, one of the first to do so, was principally known for her work in ritual dances, but Cecil Sharp, in the six volumes of his Country Dance Book, published between 1909 and 1922, attempted to reconstruct English country dance as it was performed at the time of Playford, using the surviving traditional English village dances as a guide, as the manuals defined almost none of the figures described. Sharp and his students were, however, almost wholly concerned with English country dances as found in the early dance manuals: Sharp published 160 dances from the Playford manuals and 16 traditional village country dances. Sharp believed that the Playford dances, especially those with irregular forms, represented the original \"folk\" form of English country dance and that all later changes in the dance's long history were corruptions.  This view is no longer held."]}, {"page": "Morris dance", "response": ["Several English folklorists were responsible for recording and reviving the tradition in the early 20th century, often from a bare handful of surviving members of mid-19th-century village sides.

Cecil Sharp was visiting at a friend's house in Headington, near Oxford, when the Headington Quarry Morris side arrived to perform. Sharp was intrigued by the music and collected several tunes from the side's musician, William Kimber, including Country Gardens. A decade later he begin collecting the dances, spurred and at first assisted by Mary Neal, a founder of the Esp\u00e9rance Club (a dressmaking co-operative and club for young working women in London), and Herbert MacIlwaine, musical director of the Esp\u00e9rance Club.

Later in 1914, all folk dancing lectures and classes ceased during the First World War. Sharp's first collaborator had been Mary Neal. She had formed another dance group, the Esp\u00e9rance Club of Morris Dancers. When Mary Neal moved in the direction of Women's Suffrage, Sharp distanced himself from her, and instead made Maud Karpeles his colleague and assistant. Sharp returned to the Appalachian Mountains in 1916, this time together with Maud Karpeles, who was then 31. They collected over 1,500 tunes (over 500 different songs and variants) in a period of 46 weeks in isolated communities often reached only by mule. Many of these songs were clearly and importantly related to songs they had encountered in England. This strengthened their conviction that folk songs were subject to a kind of Darwinian selection over generations, and diffusion across the sea. These songs and tunes were published in 1932.", "At the end of the war in 1918, neither Mary Neal's Esp\u00e9rance Guild nor Maud's group reformed. Effectively the folk dance movement changed from being working class to being middle class. Sharp arranged for teachers to give classes in country dance and Morris to members of the society, using his books for guidance. Choirs were created to sing folk songs in unison, even though all the singers who had provided the songs, had normally sung solo. After about 1920, Sharp ceased to collect dances - he was then in his 60s - but Karpeles was only 45 in 1920, and continued to collect. She collected clog-Morris dances from the north-west of England, in Royton and Abram. She continued to collect English country dances in the 1920s and 1930s.
