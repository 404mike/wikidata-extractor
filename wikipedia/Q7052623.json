He was a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School (1958\u20131985) and was also a university administrator. From 1971 to 1980, he was dean of medicine, and then deputy vice-chancellor at the University of London.  However his greatest contribution was to question current standards of prenatal care. He was critical of the way that midwives and obstetricians treated women, and his work was summarized in a paper in the Lancet in 1960. This paper was based on  interviews with 500 women, included no references and at the time was extremely controversial. In 2007, the Lancet included this paper in the '200 most important publications in the Lancet'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dunstable Grammar School", "response": ["* Norman Morris (1920-2008), professor of medicine and humanitarian who revolutionized maternity care in the UK"]}, {"page": "Morris (surname)", "response": ["* Norman Morris (1920\u20132008), British obstetrician", "* Norman Morris (English cricketer) (1949\u20131974)", "* Norman Morris (Australian cricketer) (1907\u20131982)"]}, {"page": "Norman Frederick Morris", "response": ["#REDIRECT Norman Morris "]}]}}
