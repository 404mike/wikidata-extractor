He was the creator and lead programmer of the Creatures artificial life simulation, which he discussed in his first book Creation: Life and How to Make It, a finalist for the 2001 Aventis Prize for Science Books. He is also an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, which he received in 2000.Grand's project from 2001 to 2006 was the building of an artificial robot baby orangutan, with the intention of having it learn as a human baby would. This is documented in his book Growing up with Lucy.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Creatures (video game series)", "response": ["Creatures is an artificial life (alife) video game series, created in the mid-1990s by English computer scientist Steve Grand whilst working for the Cambridge video games developer Millennium Interactive. ", "Mutations in the genome also occur, allowing new characteristics to appear in the population and potentially be inherited by a future generation. Because the Norns have a lifespan of roughly 40 hours, users could observe the changes that occur over a large number of generations. Faulty genomes can also occur - for example, Norns which cannot see or hear, or immortal Norns due to a hyper-efficient digestion system. Creatures used the emergent approach seen in animats, but with the goal of more complex behaviours than locomotion.  Grand describes the psychological model of the creatures as being inspired by rats.  In 2000, Steve Grand described the intelligence level of Norns as being like ants. Margaret Boden, in 2003, rejected Creatures as being a form of alien life as the simulated metabolism is concerned with controlling the Norn's behaviour, not on maintaining its 'physical' form. In 2011, Steve Grand stated that while the Norns in Creatures could learn, generalise from past experiences to novel experiences, and react in an intelligent manner to stimuli, they could not think."]}, {"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["* Creation: Life and How to Make It by Steve Grand"]}, {"page": "Lucy (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Lucy, a robot baby orangutan which was the subject of an artificial life experiment by Steve Grand"]}, {"page": "Rome: Pathway to Power", "response": ["Rome: Pathway to Power uses an isometric interface and was based on an engine developed by Steve Grand in 1979 called Microcosm.
