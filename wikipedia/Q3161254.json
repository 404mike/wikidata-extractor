His paternal uncle David Marquand, paternal grandfather Hilary Marquand, and maternal grandfather Elwyn Jones were all Welsh Labour Party MPs, and his maternal grandmother Pearl Binder, who was of Russian-Jewish and Ukrainian-Jewish descent, was an author and illustrator. As a child, much of his time was spent on film sets observing his father. Later, he was an editor on his father's final film Hearts of Fire. His first short film, The Lesson (1998), was nominated for a BAFTA Kodak Award. He moved on to feature films when he wrote, directed, and produced his first film, Dead Man's Cards (2006).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marquand", "response": ["* James Marquand (born 1964), Welsh film editor and director"]}, {"page": "Richard Marquand", "response": ["In 1960, Marquand married screenwriter Josephine Elwyn-Jones, the daughter of Labour MP Elwyn Jones and author and illustrator Pearl Binder.

The screenplay told the story of a young orphan girl in Victorian Mid Wales who enlists two local men to help her wreak revenge on those who killed her father; Marquand used to tell the story to his children when they were on holiday at the family's cottage near Tregaron. Marquand reportedly pitched it to Hollywood producers who expressed interest in making it into a film; however, Marquand declined the offer because the producers insisted the story be relocated to the Rocky Mountains in the United States. In the interview, James Marquand expressed interest in adapting his father's screenplay into a film."]}, {"page": "David Marquand", "response": ["Marquand was born in Cardiff; his father was Hilary Marquand, also an academic and former Labour MP.
