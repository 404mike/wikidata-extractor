With goalkeeper Stuart Sharratt out injured, he brought in Geoff Hickson on loan from Crewe Alexandra. Despite inconsistent results, fans threw their support behind Lee after witnessing consistent improvements in the Vale's performances. He solved his goalkeeping problems by signing Keith Ball from Walsall for 'a small fee', and his side put together a five-game unbeaten run in November. He adopted a more 'hit and run' style in March, and his side ended the campaign in 13th place with 46 points from their 46 games, scoring 46 and conceding 46 goals.", "For the 1971\u201372 campaign he released Mick Hopkinson, John Green, and John King; and signed left-half John Flowers from Doncaster Rovers and full-back Tony Loska from Shrewsbury Town for 'a small fee'. Pre-season did not run smoothly however, as Lee fell out with Sammy Morgan, and had to contend with injuries to Roy Sproson, Stuart Sharratt, and top-scorer John James. Low attendances forced him to sell Clint Boulton to Torquay United for \u00a310,000. In December, he brought Ray Harford from Mansfield Town for a \u00a35,000 fee, as well as Keith Lindsey from Southend United for 'a small fee'. War in the boardroom continued, whilst only 2,809 turned up to see a 1\u20130 home win over Mansfield Town on 4 March. On 8 May, Sproson made his farewell competitive appearance for the club in front of only 2,743 supporters, and Lee angrily declared that \"the attendance was nothing short of a disgrace to mark the end of a legend\". Safety was assured with a 15h place finish, five points above relegated Mansfield Town.", "He did not retain the services of four players for the 1972\u201373 season: Mick Morris, Keith Ball, Stuart Sharratt, and John Flowers. Lee made some key signings however, bringing in Stafford Rangers goal-machine Ray Williams for \u00a33,000, midfielder Freddie Goodwin (Southport), 'controversial' goalkeeper Alan Boswell (Bolton Wanderers), young midfielder Colin Tartt, and trialist goalkeeper Reg Edwards (Nuneaton Borough). Six wins were gained from the opening eight league games, though low attendances caused Lee to remark that \"the people here are not genuinely interested in league football\". Offered the management position at Shrewsbury Town, he rejected the offer as he believed the club \"lacked potential\" and that he had a \"feeling of loyalty towards the [Vale] players\". In mid-season he sold John James to Chester for \u00a35,000, Ray Harford to Colchester United for \u00a31,750, and Keith Lindsey to Gillingham for \u00a3750, whilst spending \u00a32,250 to bring 'pacey' striker John Woodward in from Walsall. Lee's team was criticized for foul play, particularly on 10 March, when Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy branded them \"a brutal and physical side\". In the FA Cup, West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood claimed that the Vale players attempted \"the most blatant calculated intimidation I have ever seen anywhere in the world\". Vale finished in sixth spot with 53 points, four short of promoted Notts County.

He was loaned to Fourth Division side Port Vale in August 1968, as manager Gordon Lee needed cover for the injured Stuart Sharratt. Described as a \"part-time, pipe-smoking civil servant\", he featured for the \"Valiants\" in the next twenty matches, but was recalled by Crewe in November that year.
