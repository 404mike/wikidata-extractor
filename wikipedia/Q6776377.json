He made his name at Peterborough United playing in the Fourth Division and in his last season at The Posh he made the PFA Division Four Team of the Year. With Posh unable to gain promotion from the Fourth Division, Pike's impressive performances for Posh brought him to the attention of Billy McEwan, manager of Second Division Sheffield United. However, with United struggling in Pike's second season at United -1987\u201388 - McEwan was sacked and the Blades appointed Dave Bassett but he was unable to prevent relegation to the Third Division.\nPike survived Bassett's player exodus and recruitment of several players in the pre-season of 1988 and was a regular in the 1988\u201389 season, whilst also contributing several crucial goals from his customary left back slot, as United bounced back at the first attempt finishing second. However, Pike found himself on the sidelines back in the second division as Bassett signed another left back David Barnes. With first team opportunities now limited, Pike went out on loan first to Tranmere Rovers and then Bolton Wanderers before a permanent move to Fulham. Pike played over 200 games for Fulham before he ended his Football League career at Rotherham United, and also had a period with Durham City.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pike (surname)", "response": ["* Martin Pike (athlete) (1920\u20131997), British sprinter", "* Martin Pike (English footballer) (born 1964), English footballer", "* Martin Pike (Australian footballer) (born 1972), Australian rules footballer"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1980s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Martin Pike"]}, {"page": "Martin Pike", "response": ["Martin Pike is the name of", "* Martin Pike (athlete) (1920\u20131997), British sprinter", "* Martin Pike (English footballer) (born 1964), English footballer", "* Martin Pike (Australian footballer) (born 1972), Australian rules footballer"]}]}}
