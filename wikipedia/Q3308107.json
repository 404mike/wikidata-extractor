An unbroadcast pilot was filmed in May 1990. It featured Mike Reid as the host, and snooker player and commentator John Parrott as his assistant. Michael Checkland, the BBC's Director-General, felt that the structure and scoring was too similar to Bullseye. He also believed that Reid and Parrott did not have the right 'double-act' relationship. A second pilot, never intended for broadcast, was filmed several months later, now with Jim Davidson as host, and with both John Parrott and John Virgo acting as assistant at various points for producer John Burrowes to assess which had the better working relationship with Davidson; ultimately it was decided that Davidson and Virgo had the ideal 'double-act' that the BBC were looking for. This second pilot was never broadcast, but an out-take from it later featured in an episode of Auntie's Bloomers.
