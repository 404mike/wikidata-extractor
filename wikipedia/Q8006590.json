Because of this he had to build a castle \"to protect his steward and collieries from the wild Irish\".William Carrigan, History and Antiquities of the Diocese of Ossory, Vol. II p. 158, quoting from Comber, T., Memoirs of the Life and Death of the Lord Deputy Wandesford (Cambridge, 1778). Apparently he regretted this decision on his death bed and asked that half the rent for the entire area for the last 21 years be repaid to the O'Brennans. This was not done, despite the legal efforts of the clan. Finally in 1686 the Lord Chancellor of Ireland pronounced judgment in their favour, although it seems that this was not the end of the matter."]}, {"page": "List of Kilkenny people", "response": ["*William Carrigan (1857\u20131924)"]}, {"page": "Osraige", "response": ["* Mo Lua of Killaloe who founded the monasteries of Killaloe and Clonfert-Mulloe (now Kyle in County Laois) in northern Osraige.

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Ossory still to this day provides a very close outline of the kingdom's borders.Downham, \"Career\", p. 7; Mac Niocaill, Ireland before the Vikings, pp. 3\u20134. In the earliest times, the chief church in Osraige was undoubtedly Seir Kieran (County Offaly), the chief church of St Ciar\u00e1n, but at some time in history it had been eclipsed by Aghaboe (County Laois), chief church of Saint Cainnech, and later moved to Kilkenny, which was also founded by the same saint. The record of the Irish annals also points to Freshford, County Kilkenny being of some importance, while archaeological evidence suggests that Kilkieran, Killamery and Kilree (all County Kilkenny) and Domnach M\u00f3r Roigni (now Donaghmore, County Laois) were also significant early ecclesiastical sites.Downham, \"Career\", p. 7; Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 292\u2013294; Byrne, Irish kings and high-kings, pp. 180\u2013181.
