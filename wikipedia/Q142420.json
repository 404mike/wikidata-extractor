Sophie was the daughter of the Pre-Raphaelite inspired painter Edmund Leighton. The Hardings had a daughter and two sons. During this period Harding was the first to employ the technique of dewatering of soil in the UK and the first to use the Joosten process of stabilisation by two part chemical injection.British Tunnelling Society 2000 Harold Harding Lecture "]}]}}
