Millesime was unhappy with certain aspects of the story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it \"too boring\". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences \"would go nuts with frustration and irritation\" if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought \"a kiss would be an emotional pay-off\", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version\u2014the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. \"After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate!

A recurring image in Austen films is that of women gazing through a window to the outside world, or walking in the countryside.Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 150 The critic Julianne Pidduck in her essay \"Of Windows and Country Walks\" argues the former image symbolizes repression and a woman's lot in Regency England, being trapped in a patriarchal society, while the latter image symbolises freedom.Irvine, Robert Jane Austen, London: Routledge, 2005 page 150. The critic Mary Favret, in her 2000 essay \"Being True to Jane Austen,\" argued that because film is literally just moving pictures, it resists the tendency of photography to have a fixed image, suggesting a world where change is always possible. Because of this, Favret praised the 1995 version of Persuasion as the film used a wandering camera to capture in a kaleidoscopic way Anne Elliot's unexpressed romantic-sexual feelings even when Anne (Amanda Root) remained still and silent. Irvine noted that film adaptations of Austen's work often used the physicality of the actors to show the sexual desires of the characters that Austen herself only hinted at, with Irving calling a \"particularly notorious\" example of this being the scene from the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice, where Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) dives into a pond and emerges with wet clothes clinging to his body before a clearly interested Miss Bennet (Jennifer Ehle).", "|Amanda Root"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1989", "response": ["|The BFG||Brian Cosgrove||David Jason, Amanda Root||Animation||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1995", "response": ["|Persuasion||Roger Michell ||Amanda Root, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, Susan Fleetwood||Literary drama ||The film premiered on television in Britain, but was released theatrically in the US and other countries."]}]}}
