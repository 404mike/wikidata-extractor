Variety commented that \"Roman Polanski approaches rock bottom\" and called the film \"a phony slice of huis clos drama\" with \"a script that's all over the map and a tone that veers from outre comedy to erotic game-playing.\" Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times: \"Whatever else Mr. Polanski may be \u2013 nasty, mocking, darkly subversive in his view of the world \u2013 he definitely isn't dull. Bitter Moon is the kind of world-class, defiantly bad film that has a life of its own.\" A positive review came from Roger Ebert, who said \"Polanski directs it without compromise or apology, and it's a funny thing how critics may condescend to it, but while they're watching it you could hear a pin drop.\"Roger Ebert on  rogerebert.com Time Out commented that \"Polanski treats this slightly protracted tale of erotic obsession partly as deeply ironic black comedy\", \"rich and darkly disturbing\" and \"also wickedly entertaining.\" Reviewing the film in 2009, Scott Tobias wrote: \"Bitter Moon is my favorite of the later-period Polanski films...nasty, potent, and psychologically knotty in a way that recalls the devil-may-care, enfant terrible Polanski of old.\" According to journalist Matthew Tempest, he and film director Christopher Nolan shared \"a soft spot\" for Bitter Moon as students."]}, {"page": "Tony Blair", "response": ["Blair, on coming to office, had been \"cool towards the right-wing Netanyahu government\".Seldon, Blair, p. 506.

After the election in 1999 of Ehud Barak, with whom Blair forged a close relationship, he became much more sympathetic to Israel. From 2001, Blair built up a relationship  with Barak's successor, Ariel Sharon, and responded positively to Arafat, whom he had met thirteen times since becoming prime minister and regarded as essential to future negotiations. In 2004, 50 former diplomats, including ambassadors to Baghdad and Tel Aviv, stated they had \"watched with deepening concern\" at Britain following the US into war in Iraq in 2003.
