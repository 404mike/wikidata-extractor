His big break came on 21 November 1936, when he sang in London's Gaumont Theatre for a regional competition of the BBC Amateur Hour. He won the competition at both the regional and the national levels.Lady Dorothy Peploe (1893-1976) became McHugh's benefactor but withdrew her support when McHugh married.

Although widely travelled, McHugh lived his entire life in Wolverhampton except for a brief residence in Chalkwell before moving back into Wolverhampton, where he died and is buried.His friend Muriel Emms wrote a biography of McHugh which was given to him on his 88th birthday in 1999.
