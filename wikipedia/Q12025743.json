The proprietor (Palin), Mr. Arthur Wensleydale (Henry Wensleydale in the TV version), appears to have nothing in stock, not even cheddar, \"the single most popular cheese in the world\". A slow crescendo of bouzouki music plays in the background performed by Joe Moretti, as Terry Jones and Graham Chapman dance while dressed in bowler hats and business suits. Cleese initially expresses appreciation of the music, being \"one who delights in all manifestations of the Terpsichorean Muse\", but as the sketch progresses it mirrors Cleese's growing frustration until he loudly demands the music cease. As Cleese lists increasingly obscure, unsavoury, and, in one instance fictional,Venezuelan Beaver Cheese is fictional (Annotated Flying Circus, Luke Dempsey, 2001) cheeses to no avail, the proprietor offers weak excuses such as \"Ohh! The cat's eaten it.\"  Cleese remarks that it is not much of a cheese shop, but Palin insists it is the best in the district due to its cleanliness, to which Cleese replies \"Well, it's certainly uncontaminated by cheese.\"  Eventually, Cleese asks if Palin has any cheese at all, to which Palin replies \"yes\". Cleese then tells him that he will ask the question again, and if Palin says \"no\", he will shoot him \"through\" the head. Palin answers \"no\" the second time, and Cleese immediately shoots him, then muses, \"What a senseless waste of human life!\"  He then puts on a Stetson, and the sketch segues into Hugh Walpole's Rogue Cheddar and a link to the Sam Peckinpah's \"Salad Days\" sketch."]}, {"page": "Chris Curtis", "response": ["Upon his return to London from Sweden, Curtis recorded his only solo single, \"Aggravation\" (backed with \"Have I Done Something Wrong?\"). \"Aggravation\" was a Joe South song.

The song and the group's proto-power trio line-up both made a strong impression on the Who, who would cover it in their 1970 album Live at Leeds, whose CD liner notes proclaim the original to be the UK's best pre-Beatles rock single. Canada's The Guess Who reached #1 in their home country and skirted the US Top 20 with a cover version in early 1965.

A song was written in a hurry while sat in the basement of Chas McDevitt's Freight Train coffee Bar, and recorded the following day in one take, plus minor overdubs (mainly Joe Moretti).  On hearing the finished song, the intended A-side (a revival of the oldie, \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\") was instead relegated to the flip.

The song was originally to be a B-side to a cover of Ricky Nelson's \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\". Kidd was told that a self-penned song could be used and together with The Pirates the new number was written in the basement of the Freight Train coffee bar the day prior to recording. In addition to Kidd (vocals), Alan Caddy (guitar), Clem Cattini (drums) and Brian Gregg (bass) session guitarist Joe Moretti was called in by Kidd and Caddy to play lead guitar.
