He is one of the longest-serving members of the company, having worked there since 1989.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donkey Kong Country", "response": ["Donkey Kong Country was developed over the course of 18 months, with programming beginning around August 1993. It had an estimated development budget of $1 million. Rare assembled a team of 12; according to product manager Dan Owsen, 20 people worked on Donkey Kong Country throughout the development. Some sources, including character designer Steve Mayles and head programmer Chris Sutherland, indicate that development began after Nintendo offered Rare its catalogue of characters to create a game using the SGI technology, and the Stampers chose Donkey Kong. Conversely, lead designer and Steve Mayles' brother Gregg Mayles recalled that it was Nintendo that requested a Donkey Kong game.", "The first demo was playable by November 1993. The staff made Donkey Kong Country a side-scrolling platformer because they had grown up playing Nintendo's Super Mario games and wanted to deliver their own \"modern\" take. At the time, Donkey Kong Country had the most man hours ever invested in a video game, 22 years. In 2019, Gregg Mayles stated that the number of hours the team put into Donkey Kong Country would be impossible in the modern game industry. He noted that game development was more of a hobby at the time, as much of the Rare staff were young and \"just felt like we'd been given an opportunity to make something pretty cool, and that's all we were trying to do\".", "Though Nintendo is usually highly protective of its intellectual properties, it was relatively uninvolved with Donkey Kong Country, leaving most of the work to Rare. Tim Stamper and Gregg Mayles were the only Rare employees who had significant ties to Nintendo during the project. Donkey Kong Country was the first Donkey Kong game that was neither directed nor produced by franchise creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who was working on Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (1995) at the time. Miyamoto was still involved with the project and provided \"certain key pieces of input\".", "The level design was heavily influenced by Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988). Gregg Mayles said he wanted to make a game that was \"easy to pick up\" but would flow seamlessly if a player practiced. As such, objects such as enemies, swinging ropes and barrel cannons were placed so players could continually move through a level as if walking up steps. Levels were designed using Post-it Notes that the team pieced together. Gregg Mayles noted that the Post-it Notes kept design \"fluid\" and made it easy to scrap mistakes. The team began designing levels by establishing a predominant feature (e.g. swinging ropes), before determining the uses of the feature. As Gregg Mayles said, \"it was kind of done by getting the framework in place first, and then filling the gaps in later\". Secret areas were added while designing levels on Post-it Notes, inspired by Super Mario and the Indiana Jones films.", "The player character's attacks changed considerably during development. Gregg Mayles said that the team wanted moves that would be \"iconic\". Because he wanted the game to be fast, the attacks needed to suit fast gameplay. Choosing a satisfactory attack proved challenging; Gregg Mayles recalled that the team considered at least six different attacks, such as a slide and a \"leapfrog\" attack. One attack, in which Donkey Kong smashed his fist on an enemy's head to leap, was cut because it interrupted game flow. Cutting moves became so common that whenever one was cut Steve Mayles would play the Queen song \"Another One Bites the Dust\" on a CD. Rare finally settled on the roll, which Gregg Mayles noted worked similarly to a bowling ball. The ability to jump in midair while rolling was implemented because the developers found it was easy to accidentally fall off a ledge while rolling. Gregg Mayles found the change useful, so he incorporated it into the level design.", "Simultaneous cooperative gameplay was planned but scrapped due to time and hardware constraints. According to Gregg Mayles, having two players on a single screen was challenging, while split-screen multiplayer was unfeasible. Simultaneous multiplayer also conflicted with his vision of fast gameplay. Mayles has said that if he were to remake Donkey Kong Country, he would want to implement the simultaneous gameplay. The team planned to have Donkey Kong wear a hard hat in mine levels, but this was replaced by Squawks the Parrot due to palette limitations and animation problems. Sutherland also had to cut many of K. Rool's animations for the final boss fight to maintain a good frame rate, to the chagrin of Steve Mayles. Programmer Brendan Gunn said most of the scrapped concepts were minor, and only regretted that Donkey Kong walks across \"lazy\" dotted lines instead of paths on the world map.", "Reviewing the game for release, Nintendo directed Rare to significantly reduce the difficulty to appeal to a broad audience; Nintendo thought the numerous secrets would provide sufficient challenge for hardcore gamers. At this point, Miyamoto made some last-minute suggestions, such as Donkey Kong's \"hand-slap\" move, that were incorporated into the game. Gregg Mayles recalled Nintendo's input as supportive and helpful, as the Rare staff was inexperienced.", "The idea of Donkey Kong having a companion came from Rare's search for a game mechanic akin to the Super Mario series' power-up system; Gregg Mayles said \"we thought a second character could perform this function, look visually impressive and give the player a feeling that they were not alone\". Gregg Mayles initially intended for the partner to be Donkey Kong Jr. and created Diddy Kong as a redesign of the character. However, Nintendo considered the redesign too great a departure from the original, and asked that Rare either rework it or present it as a new character. Mayles felt the redesign suited the updated Donkey Kong universe, so chose to make it a new character. Naming the character was a challenge, and Mayles dropped his preferred \"Dinky Kong\" following copyright problems with Dinky Toys.", "Steve Mayles created the other new Kong characters using the Donkey Kong model as a base. For instance, he created Funky Kong by taking Donkey Kong's model and adding teeth, sunglasses and a bandanna. Gregg Mayles said the team did not put too much thought into creating characters, simply wanting a diverse cast. The animal companions, such as Rambi the Rhino, were an extension of Diddy's function as a power-up. A number of animal companions were cut, such as an owl who provided tips, who was redesigned as Cranky Kong. Cranky, who Rare considered the Donkey Kong character from the arcade games, was intended to be a character who harkened \"back to the old times\". Cranky's dialogue was written by Gregg Mayles and Tim Stamper; his dry sarcasm came from Rare's British humour. Rare avoided mentioning that Cranky was the original Donkey Kong in the game and marketing materials, fearing that Nintendo would disapprove of the idea.", "As the Donkey Kong franchise did not have much of an established universe, Nintendo gave Rare freedom to expand it. Rare initially considered using the Super Mario character Wario as the antagonist and developed a storyline in which he stole a time machine from Mario, but Nintendo instructed Rare to create original characters instead. King K. Rool and the Kremlings were originally created for Jonny Blastoff and the Kremling Armada, a cancelled adventure game Rare planned for Macintosh computers. When development of Donkey Kong Country began, Steve Mayles reworked the Kremlings for the Donkey Kong universe. The Kremlings were originally to use realistic weapons, such as guns, but this conflicted with the game's lighthearted tone. Gregg Mayles also wanted K. Rool and the Kremlings to seem incompetent, similar to the villainous cartoon characters Dick Dastardly and Muttley.", "Donkey Kong Country was one of the first games for a mainstream home video game console to use pre-rendered 3D graphics, a technique used in the earlier 1993 Finnish game Stardust for the Amiga. Rare developed a compression technique that allowed the team to incorporate more detail and animation for each sprite for a given memory footprint, which better preserves the pre-rendered graphics. Nintendo and Rare called the technique for creating the game's graphics Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM). This pushed the SNES hardware to its limits and there was concern that it would be impossible to compress the SGI-rendered models, which used millions of colours, into 15-colour SNES sprites. A single SGI screen took up more memory than an entire 32 MB SNES cartridge; Gregg Mayles compared it to turning a million-piece jigsaw puzzle into a 1,000 or 100 piece one. He described transferring the backgrounds into the game as \"the bane of the project\" and spent \"thousands of hours\" trying to split the images into tiles to fit in an SNES cartridge. The team's mentality was to attempt to compress SGI visuals and implement them even if it seemed impossible.", "The artists began by rendering the characters in NURBS using PowerAnimator and adding textures. They would then create the animations and render them frame by frame, before compressing them for use in the game. The ACM process was handled by a designated computer that had a proprietary utility similar to Deluxe Paint. Adapting to the cutting-edge SGI workstations was difficult; Steve Mayles said they had \"a really steep learning curve\". Three programmers used the machines using only a massive user guide that \"wasn't written from an artist['s] point of view\". The internet did not exist at the time, so Rare essentially had to work from scratch. A single model took hours to render, so the team would leave the computers running overnight. Sometimes, artists would shut down other artists' computers in the middle of the process so they could render their models. The SGI machines required a massive air conditioning unit to prevent overheating, while the team worked in the summer heat without relief. A rumour suggested that Rare was investigated by the Ministry of Defence for their amount of advanced workstations; although Gregg Mayles said this was false, Rare did receive complaints regarding the amount of power the SGI hardware used. The Rare farmhouse where the game was developed also frequently lost power, to the puzzlement of the electricity board. Sutherland was responsible for implementing the graphics in-game and found having to reduce characters' frames of animation challenging.", "A few weeks into development, Rare, at the point when the team had established how the game would look, presented a demo to Nintendo in Japan. Rare's audience included Miyamoto, Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi, and future Nintendo president Genyo Takeda. According to Gregg Mayles, Nintendo was impressed, though Yokoi said that he was concerned the game was \"too 3D\" to be playable. Mayles attributed this to the shock Yokoi felt by seeing such advanced graphics.", "In 2000, Rare developed a port of Donkey Kong Country for Nintendo's Game Boy Color (GBC) handheld console. The port was developed alongside the GBC version of Perfect Dark and many assets, including graphics and audio, were re-used from Rare's Game Boy Donkey Kong games. Aside from graphical and sound-related downgrades due to the GBC's weaker 8-bit hardware, the port is mostly identical to the original release. One level was redesigned while another was added. It also adds bonus modes, including two minigames that supplement the main quest and support multiplayer via the Game Link Cable, as well as Game Boy Printer support. Gregg Mayles was not involved with the port but was impressed that it was possible to recreate the entire game on the GBC."]}, {"page": "Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest", "response": ["Diddy's Kong Quest, like its predecessor, uses Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) rendering technology, in which pre-rendered images are modelled as 3D objects and then transformed into 2D sprites and background layers. The game's pirate-themed narrative and level design was influenced by designer Gregg Mayles's fascination with the Golden Age of Piracy. The team attempted to maintain the sense of speed and requirement of timing from the previous game. To avoid reproducing the same game entirely, Mayles altered the gameplay to be less linear and more encouraging of exploration, while respecting the basics of fluidity and speed."]}, {"page": "Donkey Kong 64", "response": ["Following its success with the Donkey Kong Country games in the mid-1990s, developer Rare built its next Donkey Kong game on its predecessors' gameplay but not as a direct sequel. Rare's Gregg Mayles led the effort to create Donkey Kong 64. Development began in 1997\u2014shortly after the completion of Donkey Kong Country\u00a03: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! (1996)\u2014 intended for release on the Nintendo 64's 64DD floppy disk drive add-on. It was transitioned to cartridge after the 64DD was delayed and eventually canceled. A team of 16 people worked on the game across three years, and an additional eight members assisted in its later stages. Many developers transitioned from Rare's Banjo team, which had worked on Banjo-Kazooie (1998) and Banjo-Tooie (2000). Donkey Kong 64 was built atop the Banjo game engine."]}, {"page": "Rare (company)", "response": ["In 2006, the company released Viva Pi\u00f1ata, a game involving gardening. Incorporating elements of several franchises including The Sims, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon, it was acclaimed as innovative. The game's commercial performance was a disappointment, however, and some Rare team members questioned Microsoft Studios' large marketing budget for Gears of War and its relative neglect of Viva Pi\u00f1ata. On 2 January 2007, Rare founders Chris and Tim Stamper left the company to \"pursue other opportunities\". Former lead designer Gregg Mayles became Rare's creative director and Mark Betteridge the company's studio director. That year saw the release of Jetpac Refuelled, a remake of Jetpac for Xbox Live Arcade."]}, {"page": "Banjo-Kazooie (video game)", "response": ["Actual work on Banjo-Kazooie started in March 1997 with a development team of 10 people. As development progressed, the team grew to a total of 15 members, which included seven engineers, five artists, two designers and one musician. The team comprised both experienced and inexperienced people; some had been working at Rare for 10 years while others had never previously worked on a video game. Gregg Mayles served as the head designer. The 3D world of Super Mario 64 was a major inspiration for Banjo-Kazooie, as Rare intended to combine it with the look of Donkey Kong Country. The game was designed to appeal players of all ages in a similar vein to Walt Disney Animation Studios films. According to Rare, \"We wanted the characters to primarily appeal to a younger audience but, at the same time, give them enough humour and attitude not to discourage older players.\" The music of the game, composed by Grant Kirkhope, was designed to gradually fade from one style to the next without pause, while the overall composition loops continuously."]}, {"page": "Banjo-Tooie", "response": ["Banjo-Tooie was developed by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998.

An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep.

The fart noise segment of \"Uncle Fucka\" from South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut (1999) was the inspiration for a level theme (named \"Poo\")'s arrangement consisting of fart noises. Some characters were based on real-life people the developers encountered. Birdy the scarecrow was based on a bearded Rare developer, and Greg the Grimm Reaper was named after on Gregg Mayles.;  The bee king was inspired by a \"really scruffy\" man Seavor encountered while walking on a street in Nottingham who screamed at him, \"don\u2019t speak to me like that, in my country I am a king.\""]}, {"page": "King K.

Rool's attire changes depending on which persona he is masquerading as. His aliases include , Baron K. Roolenstein and King \"Krusha\" K. Rool. K. Rool has also been seen piloting a variety of vessels, including Gangplank Galleon, a large pirate ship in Donkey Kong Country, the Flying Krock, a steampunk inspired flying machine while in Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and the Knautilus, a fish-shaped submarine that appeared in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!.", "K.

In a former Rareware.com scribes column, Gregg Mayles stated that K. Rool's motivation for stealing the banana hoard is that he wants Donkey Kong to starve to death so that he can occupy his \"cosy treehouse pad\" or perhaps that he simply likes bananas. The latter explanation is supported by the manual of the first game, but contradicted in DK: Jungle Climber, as K. Rool states that he hates bananas. When asked what the K in \"K. Rool\" stands for, Mayles stated: \u201cIt was just a way of making him seem more important, that he'd added it to inflate his ego,\u201d joking that \"it could have been something tonal like 'Kremling' or something deliberately out of character, like Keith.\u201d"]}, {"page": "Grabbed by the Ghoulies", "response": ["The development of Grabbed by the Ghoulies began in 2000, after the completion of Banjo-Tooie.

Before any details of the game were publicised, it was rumoured that Grabbed by the Ghoulies would be the subtitle to the next Conker the Squirrel game.

The team initially considered using characters from the Banjo-Kazooie or Sabreman franchises before settling on Rare's online mascot Mr. Pants, which the company used in its website surveys collectively called \"The Pantsboard\". The character Mr. Pants was originally illustrated by artist Leigh Loveday, but the design was implemented into the game by Ryan Stevenson. Mayles recounted that the \"childish\" visual style used in It's Mr. Pants was accomplished by having the right-handed artists draw with their left hands to intentionally make the illustrations appear \"genuinely bad\"."]}, {"page": "Snake Rattle 'n' Roll", "response": ["Snake Rattle 'n' Roll was developed primarily by Rare employees Tim Stamper and Mark Betteridge. As with Rare's other NES games, it was executive produced by Howard Phillips, who soon left Nintendo in 1991. Stamper worked on the game's graphics and concepts, while Betteridge worked on the game program itself. Most of the ideas behind the game came from Betteridge, who had challenged himself to get the smallest file size for a NES game possible. According to Rare member Brendan Gunn, Betteridge found out how to develop cheap backgrounds that took up little space. After thinking about what and how to move objects on such backgrounds, he came up with the idea for a snake. Much of the game derived from another isometric video game Marble Madness, of which Rare published the NES version in 1989. They also used the same type of high speed scrolling that was used in the NES port of Marble Madness, which, according to a Nintendo Power overview of Rare, \"many said couldn't be done on the NES\". Rare's future Creative Director, Gregg Mayles, started with the company play-testing Snake Rattle 'n' Roll.
