In December 2017 the police expert was being investigated by Scotland Yard for keeping copies of confidential material, unrelated to the case he was working on, and then releasing it to the public.  Green denied that he downloaded or looked at such images. Green said that the claims made by the retired Bob Quick were \"political smears\".

Bob Quick, a former police officer who was gold commander at the Hackney siege, pointed out that media coverage of that incident criticised the police for taking too long to resolve the situation, and that the police allowed the subject of that siege to speak to his family, with poor results. Quick explained that the police objective in such cases is always to contain the threat and negotiate a resolution, but that the police had a duty to protect public safety. Maurice Punch, a criminologist who researched police use of firearms, described the situation as a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" dilemma.Punch, pp. 114\u2013115. In a BBC interview after the inquest, John O'Connor, a former senior police officer with experience of firearms operations, said \"it is about time every senior officer who may be in charge at one of these incidents had specific training\". He believed that confusion around the chain of command was common, but \"it took an incident involving an upper-middle class lawyer for these issues to come to light\", whereas previous incidents involved low-status individuals, particularly career criminals.Punch, p. 114."]}]}}
