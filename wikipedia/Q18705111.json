The 2014/15 season started strongly for the Harriers, as they remained unbeaten in their first 7 games which propelled them into the play-offs. From September till December, Harriers went on a 15 games run where no result was the same back to back. Harriers inconsistent form left them outside the play-offs approaching the Christmas period. In November it was announced that Kidderminster were having money troubles and that the wage budget would have to be decreased. This led to key players Chey Dunkley and Nathan Blissett being loaned to Oxford United and Bristol Rovers respectively, both moves being made permanent in January. One other key influence on Harriers' declining league form was the state of the deteriorating pitch. The signs of two teams playing on the pitch was showing and grass was turning to mud. This showed through December and January, Harriers winning all 4 away matches but losing all 4 at home. Reducing the budget further in January, several players were released including key striker Michael Gash and instrumental midfielder Kyle Storer after just reaching 150 appearances for the club. However, this created the chance for former West Brom goal machine Lee Hughes to rejoin Kidderminster Harriers some 18 years after leaving the club, now 38, Hughes' contract at Forest Green Rovers was cancelled by mutual consent, allowing him to sign again at Aggborough. He began his career at Aggborough in 1994 and scored 70 goals in 139 games for Harriers before moving to West Brom in 1997. Hughes went on to score on his second debut for the Harriers in a 1\u20131 home draw against Woking. Harriers were sitting 6th after boxing day, with a game in hand to go into the play offs. However, Harriers only won 3 of the last 20 games till the end of the season, losing 12 of those as they finished 16th in a tale of two halves season.
