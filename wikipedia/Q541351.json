West Germany was led by Franz Beckenbauer, while the Dutch had their star Johan Cruyff, and their Total Football system which had dazzled the competition. With just a minute gone on the clock, following a solo run, Cruyff was brought down by Uli Hoene\u00df inside the German penalty area, and the Dutch took the lead from the ensuing penalty by Johan Neeskens before any German player had even touched the ball. West Germany struggled to recover, and in the 26th minute were awarded a penalty, after Bernd H\u00f6lzenbein fell within the Dutch area, causing English referee Jack Taylor to award another controversial penalty. Paul Breitner spontaneously decided to kick, and scored. These two penalties were the first in a World Cup final. West Germany now pushed, and in the 43rd minute, in his typical style, Gerd M\u00fcller scored what turned out to be the winning goal, and the last of his career as he retired from the national team. The second half saw chances for both sides, with M\u00fcller putting the ball in the net for a goal that was disallowed as offside. In the 85th, H\u00f6lzenbein was fouled again, but no penalty this time. Eventually, West Germany, European Champions of 1972, also won the 1974 World Cup.", "* Jack Taylor"]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Leeds struggled after Raich Carter left the club in 1958, and Willis Edwards and then Bill Lambton took charge in the 1958\u201359 season as Leeds finished nine points above the relegation zone.
