The  wings under Colonels Edward Ashmore, John Salmond and Sefton Brancker participated. As the British were short of artillery ammunition, the RFC flew target identification sorties prior to the battle, to ensure that shells were not wasted. During the first few days of the attack, target-marking squadrons equipped with better wireless transmitters, helped to direct British artillery onto German targets. Later in the battle, pilots carried out a tactical bombing operation for the first time in history. Aircraft of the  wings dropped many  bombs on German troops, trains, rail lines and marshalling yards. As the land offensive stalled, British pilots and observers flew low over German positions, providing target information to the artillery."]}, {"page": "Air vice-marshal", "response": ["| Edward Ashmore"]}, {"page": "List of military figures by nickname", "response": ["*\"Splash\" \u2013 Edward Ashmore, British general who served in the Royal Flying Corps and RAF during World War I before rejoining the army to lead air defence"]}, {"page": "Ashmore (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Edward Ashmore (1919\u20132016), senior Royal Navy officer", "* Edward Ashmore (British Army officer) (1872\u20131953), founder of the Royal Observer Corps"]}, {"page": "Major-general (United Kingdom)", "response": ["*Edward Ashmore"]}, {"page": "London Air Defence Area", "response": ["In August 1917 Major-General Edward Ashmore was appointed Commander of the London Air Defence Area.Brig N.W.
