An issue of The Irish Citizen included the article entitled \u2018The Discovery of the Femaculine\u2019, uses a term coined by Duggan. She was particularly concerned by the incidence of domestic violence and sexual assaults both in society and how they were treated by the courts. Men were often treated with leniency and gaining the vote was seen as a crucial step in changing this. Duggan was the secretary of the Irish Women\u2019s Reform League. They were concerned that any woman brought to court faced a jury, judge and lawyers who were all men.  Women were barred from working as lawyers until the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 and were almost never able to serve on juries until 1976. There were a number of cases involving the assault of children including one where the perpetrator served two weeks for the crime, or another where the charge was not followed through because the victim was 7. Duggan was furious when Justice William Huston Dodd instructed the all-male jury to take into account \u201cthe natural and irresistible impulses animating the man\u201d in 1914. She wrote to the 'Irish Citizen' and formed a Courts Watch committee to attend the public sessions when a woman was in court. Even this caused difficulty when the cases were considered to contain indecent information. There was often an attempt to eject the women from the gallery. In 19 June 1915 the 'Irish Citizen' asked \"When will men realize that women are part of the public, that they are fully entitled to be present at all cases open to the public\". It was Duggan who wrote most of the reports of the courts actions for publication."]}]}}
