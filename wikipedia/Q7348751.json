He once branded Neil Kinnock a \"traitor\" over the latter's denunciation of the Militant tendency activists who dominated local government on Merseyside.

Unemployment in Liverpool was high and people left the city to find work, while remaining residents saw conditions in their housing estates decline through poor management and funding. In 1986, Member of Parliament for Liverpool Riverside Robert Parry asserted that Liverpool's housing expenditure declined in the late 20th century, suggesting every \u00a31 spent in 1979 prior to the Conservatives winning the 1979 general election had fallen to 26p in the pound by 1985. The expenses claim was disputed by Sir George Young, then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, who declared that government expenditure in Liverpool had risen to just over \u00a31 billion, from \u00a3718 million since 1979, although accepted that Liverpool's housing problems were \"among the worst in the country\". In 1985, Liverpool bid for \u00a3132 million () to help address its urgent housing problems, yet received just \u00a331 million (). Liverpool suffered with a large number of vacant properties during the 1980s, with 2,178 houses, representing 3.35% of the total, being vacant in 1984. In 1987, Gerard Gardens was demolished."]}]}}
