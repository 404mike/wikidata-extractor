He was born in Bedford and died at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. \nThomas had one of the briefest first-class cricket careers of any player. A slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he was picked by Somerset for the match against Derbyshire at Chesterfield in May 1928, two weeks before his 17th birthday. Rain prevented any play on the first two days of a three-day game, and when Derbyshire batted on the third and final day, Thomas was not given a bowl. Somerset's innings had barely started when the game was over, and Thomas did not bat. He did not play first-class cricket again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Wyndham Thomas (1928) 1 match CA"]}]}}
