As a young boy he interacted with a naturalist group where one member collected mosses while another collected fossils and in time he too began to collect fossils in Rochdale, accompanying the Borough Surveyor S.S. Platt. He attended a private school of Theodore B. Pickles and received a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School in 1876. He studied science under Francis Jones and received a Brackenbury Scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, joining in 1881. He received a first in natural science (chemistry) in 1884 and became a schoolmaster at Blair Lodge School followed by teaching at Hulme Grammar School, Manchester and in 1888, Senior Science Master at King Edward VI School.\n\nHe married Mary Brooks, sister of a friend, while teaching at Birmingham. In 1891 he joined the University Extension Board and he sought to establish an agriculture college for which he selected Wye and through E.J. Halsey, the chairman of the County Council, space and resources were allocated for the establishment of the Wye College. The founding staff included H.H. Cousins, chemist, John Percival, botanist, F.B. Smith, agriculturist, and F.V. Theobald, entomologist. Hall handled the teaching of chemistry. The college was formally opened in 1894 and had fourteen students. In 1902 he was persuaded to leave Wye and help rejuvenate research at the Rothamsted Laboratory. In 1912 he left Rothamsted to work with the Development Commission. In 1919 he became a director of the John Innes Horticultural Institution and was also a part-time advisor for the Ministry of Agriculture. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1909 and made KCB in 1918.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rothamsted Research", "response": ["* Alfred Daniel Hall (1902-1912)"]}, {"page": "Wye College", "response": ["In 1894, the school moved to new premises, and the South Eastern Agricultural College was established in the buildings with Alfred Daniel Hall as principal.

In 1913 he became a director of the research station, succeeding Alfred Daniel Hall.  Russell worked on soil chemistry and plant nutrition. Russell appointed R.A. Fisher at the experimental station in 1919 after hiring him initially on a temporary basis. Russell was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours for his efforts during the First World War as Technical Adviser in the Food Production Department. He was knighted in 1922. He served as the President of the Geographical Association in 1923 and President of the Aberystwyth Old Students' Association in 1928\u20139.

The tepals are pointed, the outer larger than the inner. The plant can be up to 45\u00a0cm tall.Anna Pavord, The Tulip. Bloomsbury 1999, 289; 20-30 cm according to Wilford (Richard Wilford 2006, Tulips, species and hybrids for the gardener, Portland, Timber Press,  77) The basal blotch is oval, black and quite short. It can also be entirely absent; very rarely, it has a narrow yellow border. Filaments and anthers are black, the pollen yellow. The flowers appear from March to May. According to the British botanist Alfred Daniel Hall, it is quite similar to Tulipa praecox, but has brighter flowers.

Through bulb-grafting experiments, she found that \"Tulip Breaking\" could be transferred from one plant to another, rather than being genetic in nature. She concluded that the infectious agent was a virus as the filtrate of an infected bulb did not cause \"breaking\", and that the virus was probably spread by aphids. Tulip enthusiasts who wanted \"true colours\" were pleased as the research showed that \"breaking\" could be prevented by stopping infection of the bulbs (for example, by aphids). Cayley described her findings in two articles published in 1928 and 1932.

Unlike his predecessor, Hunter disputed the necessity of Mendelian thinking to varietal improvement, instead believing that success relied on finding parents with desirable traits and crossing them with existing popular varieties. The appointment was doubted by Alfred Daniel Hall, the founder of Wye College because Hunter was \"a plant breeder and not a geneticist\". During the 1930s the PBI released high-yielding barley varieties, but their poor malting quality meant that they were not adopted by farmers."]}]}}
