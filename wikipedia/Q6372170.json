A third defeat out of three matches came as Castleford won a ten try game 22\u201328, a result which meant Wigan's worst start to a season in twenty-four years. With Richards still missing due to injury, conversions proved to be the difference as both teams scored five tries apiece, but kickers Roberts and Riddell could only manage one successful kick whilst the Tigers' kicker Kirk Dixon managed four. Two disallowed Castleford tries in the first ten minutes were followed by two penalty goals by Dixon to give Castleford a 0\u20134 lead. Thomas Leuluai's effort gave Wigan a try before Joe Westerman put the Tigers ahead again after 34 minutes. Castleford scored again through Brett Ferres, with Dixon converting to give Castleford a 6\u201316 lead at half-time. Wigan scored first after the break thanks to a try from Karl Pryce, but this was unconverted and Castleford replied with two more of their own with Dixon and Ferres scoring his second try. Wigan started a fight back, initially through a Goulding try, and then again through Joel Tomkins. Ainscough marked his debut with a fifty-yard try to reduce the deficit to two points, but Michael Shenton's try sealed the victory for Castleford. Michael McIlorum was also cited and suspended by the Rugby Football League after the game for a dangerous throw on Mitchell Sargent.

Racing into a 20-0 lead at the break thanks to tries from Luke Dorn, Karl Pryce and Tony Clubb, with Luke Gale adding four goals, Saints were never in the contest, producing mistakes and at best very flat rugby, compared to the very lively Quins. It took until the 48th minute for Saints to break their duck, with Francis Meli latching onto a cut-out ball from Lee Gaskell. An unlikely, and in truth undeserved comeback was on the cards when captain James Graham powered over, with Kyle Eastmond converting to bring Saints back within two scores. However these hopes were soon dashed when, from the kick-off, Nick Kouparitsas intercepted a James Roby pass; a feat characteristic of the sloppiness of St Helens and the sharpness of the Londoners continuous throughout the game. Five minutes from time, Gale added a drop-goal to wrap up the points before Roby grabbed a last minute consolation after an offload from Tony Puletua. Either the unpredictability of the competition, or the erratic form of the Saints was to blame here; only time would tell as the competition progressed."]}]}}
