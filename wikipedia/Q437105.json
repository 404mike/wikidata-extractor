Newcastle United signed him from Spennymoor United in September 1941, while he was working as a miner at Chilton Colliery. He later formed a great partnership with Ted Bates at Southampton. In total, he played for five Football League clubs between 1941 and 1958. A knee injury forced his retirement from league football.

In the 1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350 seasons, Charlie Wayman scored 56 goals, but relegation in 1953 sent Southampton sliding back into Division 3 (South)."]}, {"page": "Bishop Auckland", "response": ["* Footballer Charlie Wayman, who played for Newcastle United, Middlesbrough and Southampton was born in the town."]}, {"page": "Jackie Milburn", "response": ["Cousin to the mother of Jack and Bobby Charlton, Milburn played two trial matches at St James' Park as a 19-year-old in 1943. In the second of these, he scored six second half goals. Milburn made his competitive debut in the FA Cup in the 1945\u201346 season and was initially deployed on the left wing as a supplier to Charlie Wayman. However, Wayman was dropped before a 4\u20130 defeat to eventual winners Charlton Athletic in a 1947 FA Cup semi-final and when he afterwards vowed not to play for United again, manager George Martin made the decision to switch Milburn to centre forward. In his next match, on 18 October 1947, Milburn wore the number nine shirt for the first time and scored a hat-trick.", "As a player, Milburn continued to develop; football historian Paul Joannou described him as \"a raw talent who learned the rudiments of professional football rapidly\". Milburn continued to initially play as an inside forward, on either the left or right flank. In the season 1944\u201345 United finished 35th of 54 teams in the Wartime League. It was in that season that, due to a player shortage, Milburn made two guest appearances for Newcastle's local rivals Sunderland. Milburn failed to score in either game. Milburn also made guest appearances for Sheffield United during the season. For the 1945\u201346 season Milburn was moved to the right-wing to accommodate new signing Charlie Wayman. Milburn publicly declared that he had no qualms with his move, stating that \"I must make it quite clear that for the thirty shillings I receive per match...I consider Newcastle have the right to play me in any position\". Alongside the form of Albert Stubbins, the move lead to a marked increase in United's goalscoring potency; in their first game together, Milburn and Wayman combined to help Newcastle beat Middlesbrough 8\u20132 and other wins included beating Bradford City 11\u20130 and a 9\u20131 win over Stoke City at St James' Park Milburn's natural pace was well-suited to his new position \u2013 The Journal's sports correspondent Ken McKenzie reported after one performance that \"Milburn's speed astonished the crowd\", whilst Joannou later reflected that \"his pace always troubled opposing full-backs while he could also hit pinpoint crosses\". Milburn continued to score goals himself and finished the season as United's second highest scorer with 14 goals, as Newcastle finished 6th in the Northern War League.", "United manager Stan Seymour almost entirely rebuilt his Second Division squad during the warHutchinson, 2004: 133 so when United played Barnsley at St James' Park in the third round of the resumed FA Cup on 5 January 1946, Milburn, Bobby Cowell, Charlie Crowe, Joe Harvey and Charlie Wayman were five of nine players making their competitive debut. 60,284 spectators saw Milburn score twice \u2013 his first official goals for the club \u2013 in a 4\u20132 win. However, ties were contested over two legs that season and the return leg saw United beaten 3\u20130 and 4\u20135 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "Ted Bates (footballer)", "response": ["Bates' finest playing days came between 1947 and 1951 when he formed a great partnership with Charlie Wayman."]}, {"page": "Len Shackleton", "response": ["In October 1946, Shackleton was sold to Second Division side Newcastle United for a \u00a313,000 fee. He was sold as a direct replacement for Albert Stubbins, who had been sold from Newcastle to Liverpool for the same fee. He scored six goals on his debut in Newcastle's 13\u20130 defeat of Newport County at St James' Park on 5 October, with three of his goals coming within the space of just 155 seconds.The Times, 7 October 1946, Association Football Newcastle's 13 Goals However his return to Park Avenue in his fourth game for Newcastle was not a happy one, as he had a penalty saved by former teammate Chick Farr in a 2\u20131 defeat to Bradford PA. The \"Magpies\" boasted a devastating forward line of Jackie Milburn, Roy Bentley, Charlie Wayman, Shackleton, and Tommy Pearson, and totalled 95 league goals in the 1946\u201347 season, though their tally of 62 goals conceded and 13 defeats left the club having to settle for fifth place. They did though reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten 4\u20130 by Charlton Athletic. After the semi-final game he and club captain Joe Harvey went on strike over housing issues; the club's board eventually relented and granted Shackleton the house they had initially promised him, though to save face told the press that Harvey and Shackleton had been in the wrong and had apologised. He further came into conflict with the club at Christmas 1947, when he and goalkeeper Jack Fairbrother refused to join the squad on a scouting party on opponents Charlton Athletic, who they faced later that season in the third round of the FA Cup. Unhappy with the club, he handed in a transfer request, which was granted."]}]}}
