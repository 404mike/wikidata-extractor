Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with his two business partners John Coletta and Ron Hire, who comprised Hire-Edwards-Coletta Enterprises (HEC).", "HEC persuaded Blackmore to travel in from Hamburg to audition for the new group. He was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of the Outlaws, Screaming Lord Sutch, and Neil Christian, the latter artist prompting Blackmore's move to Germany. Curtis's erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fuelled by his use of LSD, caused him to display a sudden lack of interest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. However, HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought and persuaded Ritchie to return from Hamburg a second time. Lord and Blackmore began the recruitment of additional members, retaining Tony Edwards as their manager.Thompson, Dave. Chris Curtis Biography Allmusic.

This to an extent undermined Curtis's position as song selector for the band, and some internal disagreements resurfaced over musical policy and direction that had been evident earlier when Tony Jackson had left, and likely played a part in Curtis leaving as well after the 1966 Australian tour. This departure was a major blow, as Curtis had been chief songwriter, song selector, and key high harmony voice, as well as a figurehead member and the main PR man.", "As musical styles evolved, The Searchers did attempt to move with the times, recording covers of songs by The Rolling Stones (\"Take It Or Leave it\") and The Hollies \"Have You Ever Loved Somebody\", which was a minor UK chart hit though a rival cover by Paul & Barry Ryan probably robbed both parties of a bigger hit). They began to write their singles' A-sides, first with the Curtis-Pender track \"He's Got No Love\", which had a Stones-style guitar hook, and later a Pender-Allen song, \"Secondhand Dealer\", the final Pye single, which was a Ray Davies-style \"observational\" song. However, Pye records dropped the group in 1967 when their original contract expired. Without any follow-up to the strong 1965 album, Take Me For What I'm Worth, and despite some strong later recordings, no further chart successes occurred, doubling the impact of Chris Curtis's departure.", "*Chris Curtis: drums, vocals", "*Chris Curtis: drums, lead vocals", "*Chris Curtis: drums, lead vocals", " bar:Curtis   text:\"Chris Curtis\""]}, {"page": "Shades of Deep Purple", "response": ["Shades of Deep Purple is the debut studio album by the English rock band Deep Purple, released in July 1968 on Tetragrammaton in the United States and in September 1968 on Parlophone in the United Kingdom.

Having arranged and rehearsed the first three songs, the musicians focused their attention on \"I'm So Glad\", a song by Skip James which had earlier been covered by Cream and The Maze.Thompson: p.31 The next addition during rehearsals was \"Hey Joe\", a song originally, but disputably, written by Billy Roberts and mistakenly credited to Deep Purple on original releases of the album. The main inspiration for the new arrangement of the song was the 1966 hit version by American guitarist Jimi Hendrix, but the track length was stretched with the inclusion of classical-influenced instrumental sections. The band also selected a pop rock song called \"Hush\", written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal the previous year, which Blackmore had heard while in Germany."]}, {"page": "2005 in British music", "response": ["*28 February \u2013 Chris Curtis, drummer and vocalist, 63"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2005", "response": ["*Chris Curtis, 63, English drummer with The Searchers."]}, {"page": "Tony Jackson (singer)", "response": ["Nicknamed Black Jake, he joined the guitar duo the Searchers, which had been formed by John McNally and Mike Pender in 1959.
