The highly paid senior players Julian Marshall, Chris Garland, Jimmy Mann, Peter Aitken, Geoff Merrick, David Rodgers, Gerry Sweeney and Trevor Tainton, who became known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight', each accepted termination of his contract for half the amount due. The club's previous owners had failed to pay its debts to many local businesses. The resulting ill will towards the club made it difficult for the new owners to obtain credit."]}, {"page": "Chris Garland", "response": ["He rarely featured under Houghton, and when new manager Roy Hodgson arrived he informed Garland and seven teammates (Julian Marshall, Jimmy Mann, Geoff Merrick, Peter Aitken, David Rodgers, Trevor Tainton and Gerry Sweeney), known as the \"Ashton Gate Eight\", that would have to take voluntary redundancy as part of a last-ditch plan to save the club, which was on the verge of folding; Garland agreed and lost \u00a33,750.
