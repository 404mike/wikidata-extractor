He is a member of Council of the Natural Environment Research Council.\nFitter's research interests include plant and microbial behaviour in a changing world; functional ecology of roots and mycorrhizal associations under field conditions; root system architecture; carbon cycling in soil, especially in relation to mycorrhizas; phenological responses to climate change.Alastair Fitter is the son of the naturalist and author Richard Fitter (1913\u20132005), and together in 2002 they published an article in Science  on the changing phenology of wild flowers due to global warming. They have also collaborated on numerous field guides and other natural history books.Fitter was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2005. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services to environmental science.  He received a President's Medal from the British Ecological Society.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allelopathy", "response": ["Some high profile work on allelopathy has been mired in controversy. For example, the discovery that (-)-catechin was purportedly responsible for the allelopathic affects of the invasive weed Centaurea stoebe was greeted with much fanfare after being published in Science in 2003. One scientist, Dr. Alastair Fitter, was quoted as saying that this study was \"so convincing that it will 'now place allelopathy firmly back on center stage.'\" However, many of the key papers associated with these findings were later retracted or majorly corrected, after it was found that they contained fabricated data showing unnaturally high levels of catechin in soils surrounding C. maculosa.

Thus, it is doubtful whether the levels of (-)-catechin found in soils are high enough to affect competition with neighboring plants. The proposed mechanism of action (acidification of the cytoplasm through oxidative damage) has also been criticized, on the basis that (-)-catechin is actually an antioxidant."]}, {"page": "Fitter", "response": ["* Alastair Fitter (born 1948), British ecologist"]}, {"page": "R.
