The rope had snapped between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. Whymper asked Taugwalder to show him the rope. To his surprise, he saw that it was the oldest and weakest of the ropes they brought, and one which had been intended only as a reserve. All those who had fallen had been tied with a Manila rope, or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done.Edward Whymper, Scrambles amongst the Alps, 1872. It can be deduced that Taugwalder had no other choice but to use a weaker rope, as the stronger rope was not long enough to connect Taugwalder to Douglas.

Suddenly an avalanche started and everything on the summit began to fall away from them.

Lord Queensberry travelled post-haste to Zermatt, with the intention of bringing his brother's body home, but nothing had been found of Lord Francis but some tattered shreds of his clothing. Queensberry, alone, without a guide, and starting out by moonlight, attacked the Matterhorn himself and made it as far as \"the Hut\".  It was largely a matter of chance that two guides found and rescued him before he died of cold. He wrote apologetically to Florence, \"I thought and thought where he was, and called him, and wondered if I should ever see him again.  I was half mad with misery, and I could not help it.\"  \"Exceedingly amiable and talented\" Francis's death was deeply felt by his family.
