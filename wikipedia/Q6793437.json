London, Carlton,2006.  The first writer to specialize in the subgenre was \"F. Anstey\" in novels such as Vice Versa (1882), where magic disrupts Victorian society with humorous results. Anstey's work was popular enough to inspire several imitations, including E. Nesbit's light-hearted children's fantasies, The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904) and The Story of the Amulet (1906). The United States had several writers of fantasy comedy, including James Branch Cabell, whose satirical fantasy Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice (1919) was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscenity.Edgar MacDonald, \"James Branch Cabell\" in E. F. Bleiler, ed.Supernatural Fiction Writers (pp. .789-796). New York: Scribner's, 1985.   Another American writer in a similar vein was Thorne Smith, whose works (such as Topper and The Night Life of the Gods) were popular and influential, and often adapted for film and television.Keith Neilson, \"Thorne Smith\" in Bleiler, ed.Supernatural Fiction Writers. (pp. 805-812), 1985.

Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that \"Mr. Fleming seems to be leaving realism further and further behind and developing only in the direction of an atomic, sophisticated Sapper\". Though Fleming may have left reality behind, Richardson considered that the writer, \"even with his forked tongue sticking right through his cheek,\u00a0... remains maniacally readable\". Richardson said that Goldfinger \"is the most preposterous specimen yet displayed in Mr. Fleming's museum of super fiends\", and, referring to the novel's central character, observed that \"the real trouble with Bond, from a literary point of view, is that he is becoming more and more synthetic and zombie-ish. Perhaps it is just as well.\" In The Manchester Guardian, Roy Perrott observed that \"Goldfinger\u00a0... will not let [Bond's] close admirers down\". Perrott thought that overall \"Fleming is again at his best when most sportingly Buchan-ish as in the motoring pursuit across Europe\"; he summarised the book by saying that it was \"hard to put down; but some of us wish we had the good taste just to try\"."]}, {"page": "Moonraker (novel)", "response": ["Julian Symons, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, found Moonraker \"a disappointment\", and considered that \"Fleming's tendency\u00a0... to parody the form of the thriller, has taken charge in the second half of this story.\" Maurice Richardson, in his review for The Observer, was more welcoming: \"Do not miss this\", he urged, saying that \"Mr. Fleming continues to be irresistibly readable, however incredible\". Hilary Corke, writing in The Listener, thought that \"Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers\", and considered that Moonraker \"is as mercilessly readable as all the rest\". Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that \"Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished to need to lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: he could keep our hair on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to Shylock.\" The reviewer in The Scotsman considered that Fleming \"administers stimuli with no mean hand\u00a0...

Cochran recounted that he once invited Hackenschmidt to dine at his flat in Piccadilly.Cochran, Charles Blake. (1925). The Secrets of a Showman. W. Heinemann. p. 117 Cochran noted that Hackenschmidt ate \"eight or nine eggs, a porterhouse-steak, and a whole Camembert cheese\". Journalist Maurice Richardson commented that Hackenschmidt was a considerable meat eater during the height of his wrestling career and would eat steak and half a dozen eggs as a snack but did not eat tinned foods.Richardson, Maurice. (1979). Fits & Starts: Collected Pieces. Michael Joseph. p. 120.  \"A natural born ascetic, Hackenschmidt has lived almost the whole of his life in training. He is a teetotaller and a non-smoker. The only cigarette he ever smoked put him flat on his back after a few puffs. At the height of his wrestling career he was a considerable meat eater, his idea of a light snack before dinner was a steak and half a dozen eggs. But he always eschewed tinned foods. For many years now he has been a strict vegetarian\". In opposition to this, sportswriter Lew Freedman has written that Hackenschmidt rarely ate meat and did not like cooked food.Freedman, Lew. (2018). Pro Wrestling: A Comprehensive Reference Guide. ABC-Clio. p. 108.  \"He followed a vegetarian diet of fruits, nuts and raw vegetables and drank 11 pints of [[milk per day. He almost never ate meat and didn't even like cooked food.\""]}, {"page": "The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)", "response": ["Broadly the critics did not welcome Fleming's experiment with the Bond formula. The academic Christoph Linder points out that The Spy Who Loved Me received the worst reception of all the Bond books. The Daily Telegraph, for example, wrote \"Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear! And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!\" while The Glasgow Herald thought Fleming was finished: \"His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail.\" Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson described the tale as \"a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation\", going on to hope that \"this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of carnography\". Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking: \"why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?\" The critic for The Times was not dismissive of Bond, who they describe as \"less a person than a cult\" who is \"ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war\". Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that \"the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment.\" John Fletcher thought that it was \"as if Mickey Spillane had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists' Association\"."]}, {"page": "Rhys Hughes", "response": ["His long novel Engelbrecht Again! is a sequel to Maurice Richardson's 1950 cult classic The Exploits of Engelbrecht and is the most radical of Hughes's books, making extensive use of lipograms, typographical tricks, coded passages and other OuLiPo techniques."]}, {"page": "Melmoth the Wanderer", "response": ["Historian of English literature Walter Raleigh, in his book The English Novel (1905), stated \"in Frankenstein and Melmoth the Wanderer, the Romantic orgy reached its height\".Walter Raleigh, \"The Revival of Romance\" in The English Novel Reprinted in Jason Colavito, ed.
