Unlike the original film, the American version received negative reviews and failed to find an audience. Donald Clarke of Irish Times concluded that a \"sound job\" by the cast \"can't quite shake the whiff of compromise that hangs around the project\". In 2016, Roberts reunited with Garry Marshall and reportedly received a $3 million fee for a four-day shoot, playing an accomplished author who gave her child for adoption, in the romantic comedy Mother's Day, which had a lackluster critical and commercial response. Her next film release was Jodie Foster's thriller Money Monster, in which she  starred as a television director,  alongside George Clooney and Jack O'Connell. Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald stated: \"It may be Hollywood melodrama but it's top of the range, giving Clooney and Roberts every opportunity to demonstrate the value of star power.\" The film made a respectable $93.3 million worldwide."]}, {"page": "Nicole Kidman", "response": ["In 2015, Kidman starred in the drama Strangerland, which opened at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, and the Jason Bateman-directed The Family Fang, produced by Kidman's production company, Blossom Films, which premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.
