The screenplay by John Michael Hayes was based on the 1950 novel by Jack Trevor Story. It starred Edmund Gwenn, John Forsythe, Mildred Natwick, Jerry Mathers and Shirley MacLaine in her film debut. The Trouble with Harry was released in the United States on September 30, 1955, then re-released in 1984 once the distribution rights had been acquired by Universal Pictures.", "Contemporary reviews were middling to positive. Bosley Crowther, in a mixed verdict for The New York Times, wrote: \"It is not a particularly witty or clever script that John Michael Hayes has put together from a novel by Jack Trevor Story, nor does Mr. Hitchcock's direction make it spin. The pace is leisurely, almost sluggish, and the humor frequently is strained ... But it does possess mild and mellow merriment all the way. The performers are beguiling in a briskly artificial style, and there's an especially disarming screwball blandness about the manner of Miss MacLaine.\" Variety called the film \"a blithe little comedy\" with Edmund Gwenn \"a delight\" in the lead role. Harrison's Reports called it \"a whacky, off-beat type of film, well directed and acted and quite amusing throughout\", though the review cautioned that \"it may be received with mixed audience reaction\" because of the subject matter. Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \"an odd one\u2014sparkling cider spiked with arsenic and a sprig of poison ivy. Although I can recognize its drawbacks, I must confess it almost made me drunk with perverse pleasure.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called the film \"a comedie noire that brilliantly maintains its precarious balance between humour and bad taste\", adding, \"The humour is of a quiet and concentrated kind, with the corpse of the troublesome Harry kept persistently in the foreground, and John Michael Hayes' shrewdly witty script affords Hitchcock opportunities for some typically witty macabre and sardonic invention.\" John McCarten of The New Yorker was negative, writing, \"Alfred Hitchcock, whose work has been going steadily downhill ever since he arrived in Hollywood, skids to preposterous depths in 'The Trouble With Harry.'\""]}, {"page": "Terror of the Vervoids", "response": ["This story segment of Trial went through a number of commissions with writers including David Halliwell & Jack Trevor Story (working on separate but linked episodes), Christopher H.
