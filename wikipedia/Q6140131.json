His second season at the club saw him move down the pecking order in central midfield in January after the arrival of James Mulley. In February 2011, Wellard was sent on loan to fellow Conference side Cambridge United on a month-long loan. However, he was recalled early from his loan by Terry Brown due to an injury crisis at the Kingsmeadow. He regained his place in the Dons' first team and eventually played in the 2011 Conference Play-off final win over Luton Town, which saw the Dons gain a place in the Football League. In May 2012, Wellard was released from the club due to the expiry of his contract."]}, {"page": "Mulley, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Mulley"]}]}}
