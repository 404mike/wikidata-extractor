Ferdinand lost his position as chairman of the board of management of Volkswagen, and Ivan Hirst, a British Army major, was put in charge of the factory. (In Wolfsburg, the Volkswagen company magazine dubbed him \"The British Major who saved Volkswagen\".) On 15 December of that year, Ferdinand was arrested for war crimes, but not tried. During his 20-month imprisonment, Ferdinand Porsche's son, Ferry Porsche, decided to build his own car, because he could not find an existing one that he wanted to buy. He also had to steer the company through some of its most difficult days until his father's release in August 1947. The first models of what was to become the 356 were built in a small sawmill in Gm\u00fcnd, Austria. The prototype car was shown to German auto dealers, and when pre-orders reached a set threshold, production (with aluminum body) was begun by Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH, founded by Ferry and Louise. Many regard the 356 as the first Porsche simply because it was the first model sold by the fledgling company. After production of the 356 was taken over by the father's Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH in Stuttgart in 1950, Porsche commissioned a Zuffenhausen-based company, Reutter Karosserie, which had previously collaborated with the firm on Volkswagen Beetle prototypes, to produce the 356's steel body. In 1952, Porsche constructed an assembly plant (Werk 2) across the street from Reutter Karosserie; the main road in front of Werk 1, the oldest Porsche building, is now known as Porschestrasse. The 356 was road certified in 1948."]}, {"page": "Volkswagen", "response": ["In April 1945, KdF-Stadt and its heavily bombed factory were captured by the United States armed forces and subsequently handed over to the British, within whose occupation zone the town and factory fell. The factory was placed under the control of British Army officer Major Ivan Hirst, REME, a civilian Military Governor with the occupying forces. At first, one plan was to use it for military vehicle maintenance, and possibly dismantle and ship it to Britain. Since it had been used for military production, (though not of KdF-Wagens) and had been in Hirst's words, a \"political animal\" rather than a commercial enterprise \u2013 technically making it liable for destruction under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement \u2013 the equipment could have been salvaged as war reparations. Allied dismantling policy changed in late 1946 to mid-1947, though heavy industry continued to be dismantled until 1951.", "The car and its town changed their Second World War-era names to \"Volkswagen\" and \"Wolfsburg\" respectively, and production increased. It was still unclear what was to become of the factory. It was offered to representatives from the American, Australian, British, and French motor industries who all rejected it. After an inspection of the plant, Sir William Rootes, head of the British Rootes Group, told Hirst the project would fail within two years, and that the car \"...is quite unattractive to the average motorcar buyer, is too ugly and too noisy ... If you think you're going to build cars in this place, you're a bloody fool, young man.\"  The official report said: \"To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\"Anders Ditlev Clausager (18 March 2000).

However, no British car manufacturer was interested. A British report on the car said that the \"the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car \u2026 it is quite unattractive to the average buyer \u2026 To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise.\" In 1948, the Ford Motor Company of USA was offered Volkswagen, but Ernest Breech, a Ford executive vice president said he did not think either the plant or the car was \"worth a damn.\"Ford: The Times, the Man, the Company by Allan Nevins and Frank Ernest Nevins 1954 Breech later said that he would have considered merging Ford of Germany and Volkswagen, but after the war, ownership of the company was in such dispute that nobody could possibly hope to be able to take it over. As part of the Industrial plans for Germany, large parts of German industry, including Volkswagen, were to be dismantled. Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers. The company survived by producing cars for the British Army, and in 1948 the British Government handed the company back over to the German state, and it was managed by former Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff.", "|align=\"left\"|June 1945 to December 1947||Ivan Hirst (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers)"]}, {"page": "Volkswagen Beetle", "response": ["The re-opening of the factory is largely accredited to British Army officer Major Ivan Hirst. Hirst was ordered to take control of the heavily bombed factory, which the Americans had captured. His first task was to remove an unexploded bomb that had fallen through the roof and lodged itself between some pieces of irreplaceable production equipment; if the bomb had exploded, the Beetle's fate would have been sealed. Knowing Germany needed jobs and the British Army needed vehicles,Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), pp. 202\u20133. Hirst persuaded the British military to order 20,000\u00a0cars, and by March 1946 the factory was producing 1,000\u00a0cars a month (in Army khaki, under the name Volkswagen Type 1),Christopher, p. 203. which Hirst said \"was the limit set by the availability of materials\".

Hamburg was a central location for the Control Commission for Germany (British Element), the administration for the British Zone of Occupation, who recruited him for the position of managing director of the REME-controlled Volkswagen plant at Wolfsburg at the urging of British Army Major Ivan Hirst, who had been directing the plant. Nordhoff took up the position on 1 January 1948.Rieger, p. 110.

This cruising ability and engine durability was gained by high top gearing, and by restricting the engine breathing and performance to well below its maximum capability. Production was restarted after the war by the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, under Major Ivan Hirst after it was dismissed as valueless for war reparations by the Western Allies. In 1948 Hirst recruited Heinrich Nordhoff to run Volkswagen GmbH and in 1949 ownership was handed over to the West German government.Curbside Classic: 1946 Volkswagen 1100 (Type 11): The Beetle Crawls Out Of The Rubble The Volkswagen Type 1 'Beetle' was to become the most popular single design in history. Its production surpassed The Ford Model T on February 17, 1972. It was withdrawn from the European market in 1978.

The British Army, Red Cross and essential German services were chronically short of light vehicles. If the factory could provide them, there would be no cost to the British taxpayer and the factory could be saved. To do this, a good manager with technical experience would be needed. Maj. Ivan Hirst was told simply to \"take charge of\" the Volkswagen plant before arriving in August 1945. He had drains fixed and bomb craters filled in; land in front of the factory was given over to food production."]}, {"page": "Roy Fedden", "response": ["On his return Fedden, together with Duncan, set up Roy Fedden Ltd. in 1945.

The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), pp.202-3. The company's first product, the Fedden O-325, was a small horizontally-opposed fuel injected six cylinder sleeve valve aeroengine intended for helicopters or for submerged wing installation in aircraft.Christopher, p.205. It was technically superior to any flat-four or -six produced in the U.S.Christopher, p.205. and was being considered for the American Ercoupe.https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1947/1947%20-%200948.html The engine did not progress beyond development as \"Roy Fedden Limited\" went into liquidation in June 1947. Fedden then turned to a new  turboprop design, the Cotswold, meant to be installed within the wings of aircraft in either tractor or pusher configuration,Christopher, p.205. This source may be misleading as Gunston\"Fedden-the life of Sir Roy Fedden\" Bill Gunston, Rolls-Royce heritage Trust, Derby 1998, , p.305 shows three different schemes, all tractor nacelle installations. The Cotswold engine did not progress beyond the design stage. Finally they decided to design their own car, powered by a three-cylinder air-cooled radial, but they found it had vibration and overheating problems and tended to skid badly when being cornered hard.Christopher, p.205. Work started on a replacement chassis, but the rest of the company's engineers lost interest and left, and soon the company had to be dissolved."]}]}}
