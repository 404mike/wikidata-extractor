He joined Woolwich Arsenal (as they were then known) as an amateur in 1902. While still an amateur, he became the club's first-choice  centre half in 1903-04, having made his debut against Blackpool on 5 September 1903. He would not turn fully professional for another three years, and would still work as a teacher when not playing.\nWoolwich Arsenal were promoted to the First Division in 1904, and Sands was a near ever-present in the side. Although Arsenal were an undistinguished mid-table side at this time, they reached the FA Cup semi-finals two years running, in 1905-06 and 1906-07. Nicknamed \"Mr Reliable\", Sands stuck with the club through leaner times, including financial difficulties and then relegation in 1912-13, by which time he had been made captain of the side, and the club's move to Highbury (and its subsequent renaming) that same year.\nWith the advent of World War I, first-class football was suspended, but despite his age (33), Sands continued to play for Arsenal in unofficial wartime matches. He later left to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps on the Western Front. After peace broke out, he joined Southern League side Southend United, before retiring. In all he played 350 matches for the Gunners, a record that stood until it was broken by Bob John fifteen years later.\nHe was never capped for England, although he was called up for trials with the squad, and also played for the Football League representative team. He died in December 1965 aged 84.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joe Shaw (footballer, born 1883)", "response": ["Despite this, Shaw stayed with the club as they moved across London to Highbury, and was an ever-present in the final 1914-15 season prior to first-class football being suspended for World War I. He continued to play during unofficial wartime matches, and by the time competitive football had resumed, he had made the switch to right back. In 1919 he was made Arsenal captain, succeeding the recently departed Percy Sands. By this time Arsenal were back in the First Division, and Shaw continued to play until the age of 38. In 1922 he had made his 300th first-class appearance against Newcastle United on 23 April 1921 becoming the third player in the club's history to do so, after Sands and Roddy McEachrane."]}, {"page": "Harry Bradshaw (football manager)", "response": ["In the summer of 1899, Bradshaw moved south to Second Division Woolwich Arsenal, and achieved promotion with them as well. He signed several influential players including Archie Cross, Percy Sands, Jimmy Jackson and Jimmy Ashcroft for Arsenal, and brought in a Scottish style of play with short passing and fluid movement into position. After several seasons of near-misses, Arsenal finished second in 1903-04 and won promotion to the First Division, for the first time in the club's history. Eighteen of the twenty Arsenal players in the squad had been Bradshaw's signings.Joy (1952) p. 15"]}, {"page": "John Dick (footballer, born 1876)", "response": ["With the arrival of Percy Sands in 1903, Dick moved to right half, and continued to be an ever-present as Arsenal won promotion from the Second Division to the First Division in 1903\u201304. In the meantime he had also become club captain, though by the time promotion had come round, fellow Scot Jimmy Jackson had taken over as skipper. Dick played as first-choice right half for Arsenal's first season in the top flight (and broke the 200 match barrier, one of the first Arsenal players to do so), but at the start of the 1905\u201306 season he lost his place to John Bigden, and stepped down to the reserves. During this season he played one game for Crystal Palace, on the 17 April 1906 in the Southern Football League Division Two. He continued to play sporadically for the first team for the next five years, but never regained a regular place. In all, he played 262 games for Arsenal in the League and FA Cup, and 30 in other first-class matches."]}, {"page": "Tommy Hynds", "response": ["However, the club was engulfed in an illegal payments scandal and Hynds was banned from football for four months and fined \u00a375. While still under suspension, he was transferred to Woolwich Arsenal in December 1906. He made his debut on 1 January 1907 against Sheffield Wednesday but spent just five months at the club, displacing Percy Sands from the centre half position for 13 League matches and four FA Cup ties, as Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the 1906\u201307 competition. He scored one goal for the club."]}, {"page": "Sands (surname)", "response": ["* Percy Sands (1881\u20131965), English footballer"]}]}}
