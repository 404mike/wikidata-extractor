Chris Rogers was brought in to captain the Championship side on a one-year basis, and having been mid-table for most of the season, Somerset went on a late surge which put them right in contention for the title going into the last round of matches. Somerset defeated Nottinghamshire in their match, with Rogers scoring tons in both innings of the last game of his career, but needed Middlesex and Yorkshire to draw their match on the final day. With the game drifting, Yorkshire employed declaration bowling in order to allow Middlesex to set a target. However, as the close neared, it became clear that Yorkshire were not going to reach the target and Middlesex appeared not to have quite enough time to bowl Yorkshire out. In heartbreaking fashion, Yorkshire's lower order collapsed to hand Middlesex the title and leave Somerset finishing runners-up. Somerset had four batsmen reach 1000 runs in the Championship, those being Trescothick, Hildreth, Rogers and for the first time in his career, Peter Trego. Spinner Jack Leach claimed 65 wickets, finishing second in the Division One wicket takers list. Somerset enjoyed a good run of success in the One-Day Cup too, reaching the semi-finals before losing to eventual champions Warwickshire. Captain Jim Allenby was the leading run-scorer, passing 50 in five of his ten innings in the competition. Lewis Gregory and Tim Groenewald both performed well enough to qualify for the South team for the inaugural North v South one-day series at the start of the next season. In stark contrast, Somerset's t20 Blast campaign was disastrous, the club finished bottom of the South Group and lost their last seven games in a row.", "Under new director of cricket Andy Hurry, who returned to the club, and new head coach Jason Kerr, Somerset enjoyed an excellent start to their 2018 Championship campaign, winning three of their first five matches whilst drawing the other two. However, a heavy innings defeat to Surrey in the next round proved to be pivotal, as Surrey would go on to run away with the Championship title winning 10 of their 14 matches. Nonetheless, Somerset themselves won 7 games and only lost twice, but were consigned to yet another runners-up finish. James Hildreth broke the 1000 run barrier, whilst Lewis Gregory and Craig Overton finished with 37 wickets each. Somerset struggled to find consistency in their One-Day Cup campaign, but nevertheless entered the final round of matches with a chance to qualify for a playoff. Despite winning their final game against eventual champions Hampshire, Essex secured the win they needed to reach the playoffs in place of Somerset. The 2018 season saw Somerset take a further step forward in their t20 cricket under new t20 captain Gregory, as they reached finals day for the first time in 6 years. Despite losing two of their first three games, Somerset ended up finishing top of the South Group, winning 10 of their 14 matches to earn a home quarter-final and a chance to exact revenge for the previous year on Nottinghamshire. They were able do so, winning by 19 runs on a reserve day due to the weather, sending them to finals day. There Somerset lost out to Sussex in the semi-final by 35 runs as Sussex were able to put a sizeable score of 202 on the board. The improved performance in the competition was in no small part due to the impact of overseas signings Corey Anderson, who was the team's leading run-scorer with 514 runs at a strike-rate of 169.1, and Jerome Taylor who claimed 22 wickets in his 11 matches. Jamie Overton was Somerset's leading wicket-taker with 24 in his 16 games.", "|style=\"text-align:center\"|24|| Lewis Gregory*\u00a0 ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm fast-medium || Captain (T20)"]}, {"page": "1992 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Lewis Gregory, cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Lewis Gregory (2011\u20132021) 93 matches CA"]}]}}
