More success followed in the 1952\u201353 season when Bristol Rovers' longest serving post-war manager, Bert Tann, won a league title for the first time since 1905 and won promotion for the first time ever when the club won Division 3 (South).

Weston, a talent-scout for Bristol Rovers spotted him and recommended him to Bert Tann the Bristol Rovers manager at that time. Youra arrived in England on in August 1954.  Since he only got a one-month work permit in England, he had to appeal twice to extend his work permit.  He finally worked as a miner in order to stay in England while playing as an amateur for Bristol Rovers 3rd team in the Western League.  He was granted employment by the National Coal Board and he started working as a miner at Pensford Colliery, Somerset, on November 7, 1954."]}]}}
