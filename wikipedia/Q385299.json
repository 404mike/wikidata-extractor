In this conflict, Elinor, a reserved, practical, and thoughtful young woman who largely embodies the \"sense\" of the title, is juxtaposed with her younger sister Marianne who mostly embodies \"sensibility\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jane Austen", "response": ["In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection\".Letter dated 18\u201320 November 1814, in Le Faye (1995), 278\u2013282.

She represents the \"sense\" half of Austen's title, although not exclusively. She is 19 years old at the beginning of the book. She becomes attached to Edward Ferrars, the brother-in-law of her elder half-brother, John. She sympathetically befriends Colonel Brandon, Marianne's long-suffering admirer and eventual husband. Always feeling a keen sense of responsibility to her family and friends, she places their welfare and interests above her own and suppresses her own strong emotions in a way that leads others to think she is indifferent or cold-hearted. Ever honourable, she feels she must not reveal Lucy Steele's secret engagement to Edward, even though it causes her great suffering.

Thus, the description of most of the novel's characters and events reflects Elinor's thoughts and insights.", "*Edward Ferrars \u2013 the elder of Fanny Dashwood's two brothers.

He is disowned by his mother on discovery of the engagement after refusing, out of a sense of duty, to give it up.", "* Lucy Steele \u2013 (never called \"Miss Steele\") a young, distant relation of Mrs Jennings, who has for some time been secretly engaged to Edward Ferrars.

One of the most popular forms of fiction in Austen's time was epistolary fiction. This is a style of writing in which all of the action, dialogue, and character interactions are reflected through letters sent from one or more of the characters. In her book Romantic Correspondence: Women, Politics, and the Fiction of Letters, Mary Favret explores Austen's fraught relationship with epistolary fiction, claiming that Austen \"wrestled with epistolary form\" in previous writings and, with the publication of Sense and Sensibility, \"announced her victory over the constraints of the letter.\" Favret contends that Austen's version of the letter separates her from her \"admired predecessor, Samuel Richardson\" in that Austen's letters are \"a misleading guide to the human heart which, in the best instances, is always changing and adapting.\" According to Favret, the character of Elinor Dashwood is an \"anti-epistolary heroine\" whose \"inner world\" of thoughts and feelings does not find \"direct expression in the novel, although her point of view controls the story.\" Sense and Sensibility establishes what Favret calls a \"new privacy\" in the novel, which was constrained by previous notions of the romance of letters. This new privacy is a \"less constraining mode of narration\" in which Austen's narrator provides commentary on the action, rather than the characters themselves through the letters. Favret claims that in Sense and Sensibility, Austen wants to \"recontextualize\" the letter and bring it into a \"new realism.\" Austen does so by imbuing the letter with dangerous power when Marianne writes to Willoughby; both their love and the letter \"prove false.\" Additionally, Favret claims that Austen uses both of the sisters' letter writing to emphasize the contrasts in their personalities. When both of the sisters write letters upon arriving in London, Elinor's letter is the \"dutiful letter of the 'sensible sister'\" and Marianne writes a \"vaguely illicit letter\" reflecting her characterization as the \"sensitive\" sister. What is perhaps most striking about Favret's analysis is that she notes that the lovers who write to one another never unite with each other."]}, {"page": "Sense and Sensibility (film)", "response": ["Sense and Sensibility is a 1995 period drama film directed by Ang Lee and based on Jane Austen's 1811 novel of the same name.
