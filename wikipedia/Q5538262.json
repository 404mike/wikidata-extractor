He studied earnestly for six years at Rome, and also pursued landscape painting, a branch of art that was more congenial to his tastes. He returned to England in 1775, and in 1776 he exhibited at the Royal Academy The Infant Jupiter fed with goat's milk and honey. He afterwards exhibited portraits and landscapes, his last contribution being in 1798. Owing to frequent attacks of low fever he was unable to reside in London, and he finally settled at Richmond in Yorkshire. There he found ready employment in the commissions given him by gentlemen whose parks and residences were in his neighbourhood. His portraits are elaborately finished, although very thinly painted, whilst his earlier landscapes show much ability and feeling in their execution.  His son was the artist George Cuitt the Younger.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Harrison (architect)", "response": ["Thomas Harrison was born in Richmond, Yorkshire, England, the son of a joiner, also named Thomas.  His precise date of birth is not known, but it is likely that he was baptised on 7\u00a0August 1744.  Little is known about his early life, other than he attended Richmond Grammar School, and it is presumed that he worked with his father. In 1769 he was sponsored by a local landowner, Sir\u00a0Lawrence Dundas of Aske Hall, to join George Cuitt (who later became a landscape painter) to study in Rome. ()  Here he studied at the Accademia di San Luca, and during his seven years in Rome, amongst other activities, made drawings of Roman structures, including temples and Trajan's Column.  In 1770 Harrison submitted a design to Pope Clement XIV for converting the Vatican Cortile del Belvedere into a museum for antique statues.  This was \"favourably received but not in the end adopted\".  Three years later he entered the Accademia's competition to re-plan the Piazza del Popolo.  His design was unsuccessful, but it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1777.  Following the failure of this design to be accepted, he petitioned the pope, and was awarded gold and silver medals, and made Accademico di Merito.  He was then commissioned by the pope to alter the sacristy of St Peter's, but the pope died before the work started.  Harrison returned to England in 1776, probably via France, as he made drawings of buildings in N\u00eemes and Paris.  He produced designs for a bridge and a road in London, which were not accepted, and he returned to Richmond in 1778."]}, {"page": "Stanwick St John", "response": ["Despite the fact that the principal seat of Smithson, now 1st Duke of Northumberland, was at Alnwick Castle, sixty miles to the north, and that he had inherited other huge estates from his marriage, he was fond of his paternal seat of Stanwick and started to build a splendid new mansion called Stanwick Hall, half a mile to the south of the church, which he intended as a country retreat. The beck was bridged and a carriage drive was constructed to link with the neighbouring village of Aldbrough and Dere Street. The new Hall included a splendid summerhouse and was set in a deer park, as depicted in an oil painting now at Syon House by George Cuitt the Elder (1743\u20131818), born at nearby Moulton."]}, {"page": "Moulton, North Yorkshire", "response": ["The artist George Cuitt the Elder was born in Moulton."]}, {"page": "William Young Ottley", "response": ["He was born near Thatcham, Berkshire, the son of an officer in the Guards.

In 1791 he went to Italy, and stayed there ten years, studying art and collecting pictures, drawings, and prints, profiting from the turmoil of the French invasion. On his return to England he raised large sums by auctioning his 16th- and 17th-century paintings at Christie's in May 1801 (the lots and prices are listed by Buchanan),Buchanan, Memoirs of painting but the earlier works would at that time have found little or no market in England.   He became an arbiter of taste, and assisted collectors in the purchase of works of art and the formation of picture galleries. His own collection of drawings by Italian Old Masters he sold to Sir Thomas Lawrence, a close friend,Griffiths, 93 for \u00a38,000, and his print collection was also very fine.
