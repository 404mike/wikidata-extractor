Carried into effect 1864\u201366, the scheme involved redistributing remaining common land between a network of small arable farms whose farm houses and offices would be let with the land; developing upper hill land for game sports; and further professional development of commercial forestry. Together with sponsorship of better communications via the developing railway system and the leasing of house sites in small villages, the scheme resulted in estate income being substantially increased. At the 1883 hearings in Kingussie of the Napier Commission (the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands) Bruce represented the Seafield Estates and claimed that It was the express wish of the late Lord Seafield that none of his tenants should be removed in carrying out [the improvements].'Napier Commission in Inverness-shire, West coast, Inverness & Kingussie' accessed in April 2017 at http://napier-inverness.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/kingussie-16-october-1883-thomas.html Sir William Fraser also stated, in 1884, that:Lord Seafield, like his father, took a warm interest in the prosperity and happiness of his tenantry .... He did not like changes on his estates. The Seafield Estates during the 7th Earl's time therefore continued the tradition of not enforcing any major programme of clearance or eviction from their lands, though this was disputed by the Church of Scotland minister of Duthil, the Rev. James Bain.See section "]}, {"page": "Portsmouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Thomas Charles Bruce"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Charles Bruce"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Charles Bruce"]}, {"page": "Thomas Bruce", "response": ["*Thomas Charles Bruce (1825\u20131890), British Member of Parliament for Portsmouth, 1874\u20131885"]}, {"page": "List of Vanity Fair (British magazine) caricatures (1880\u20131884)", "response": ["|1882-04-29||The Hon Thomas Charles Bruce MP||Portsmouth||Spy||S 398||25px"]}, {"page": "Martha Bruce, Countess of Elgin and Kincardine", "response": ["Elgin's grandchildren included James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin (1811\u20131863), successively Governor of Jamaica, Governor General of British North America, and Viceroy of India; Sir Frederick Wright-Bruce (1814\u20131867), British Ambassador to China and to the United States; and the barrister and Conservative politician Thomas Charles Bruce (1825\u20131890).
