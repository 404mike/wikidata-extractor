Originally from Winchester, Paine is best known for his career with Southampton, for whom he made over 800 appearances (a club record) in 18 seasons with the club. He later played for Hereford United, and briefly worked at Cheltenham Town as a player-manager. He played primarily as a winger, but was also comfortable in other midfield positions and as a forward.\nPaine began his career as a youth player with local club Winchester City, before signing professional terms with Southampton in 1956. He quickly became a regular for the team as a right-sided winger, and was also on occasion played on the left wing, in the centre of midfield, or up front. In 1960 he was a part of the squad which won the club's only Third Division title, and in 1966 helped the club to its first promotion to the First Division. Paine left Southampton in 1974, after the club was relegated back to the Second Division.\nFor the last three years of his playing career Paine played for Hereford United, helping the club win its first Third Division title in 1976 and thus achieve promotion to the Second Division. He retired at the end of the 1976\u201377 season, and held a number of coaching roles before taking on the job of first team manager at Cheltenham Town in 1980, where he also played the occasional match. He left after just half a season, and has since held a number of coaching roles at various clubs and worked as a sports pundit in South Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southampton F.C.", "response": ["Terry Paine\u00a0\u2013 815  : 1956\u20131974", "| Honorary President || Terry Paine MBE"]}, {"page": "Alf Ramsey", "response": ["As hosts, England automatically qualified for the 1966 World Cup. The first group game, on 11 July 1966, was against Uruguay and despite attacking talent, including Jimmy Greaves and Roger Hunt, playing against a disciplined Uruguayan defence, England were held to a 0\u20130 draw. This was the first time England had failed to score at Wembley since 1945. Ramsey's statement made three years earlier looked doubtful, but he remained calm and continued experimenting when his side faced Mexico in the next game. Ramsey was using the 4\u20133\u20133 system and for each of the group games used a winger; John Connelly against Uruguay, Terry Paine against Mexico and Ian Callaghan against France.", "Ramsey dropped Alan Ball and John Connelly and brought in Terry Paine and Martin Peters, whose advanced style of play as a midfielder matched the qualities Ramsey looked for in his system. England beat Mexico 2\u20130. Ramsey replaced Terry Paine with Ian Callaghan for their final group match, against France. England won 2\u20130, securing qualification to the knockout rounds. Two difficult situations arose from the final group match. After making a vicious tackle and being cautioned, midfielder Nobby Stiles came under fire from senior FIFA officials, who called for Ramsey to drop him from the side. Ramsey strongly disagreed, and told the FA to inform FIFA that either Stiles would remain in his team or Ramsey himself would resign. Another bad tackle was committed during that match, resulting in Tottenham striker (and one of England's most prolific goal-scorers) Greaves being injured and sidelined for the next few matches. Despite having more experienced strikers in his squad, Ramsey selected young Geoff Hurst as Greaves's replacement, seeing potential in the young West Ham forward. The France match also marked Ramsey's final game with a winger. After it, he dropped Ian Callaghan from his side and brought back Alan Ball to strengthen the midfield."]}, {"page": "Cheltenham Town F.C.", "response": ["|1979|| Terry Paine"]}, {"page": "Hereford United F.C.", "response": ["*  Terry Paine"]}]}}
