He is a former KUGB national champion and British team member. Like many of the early karateka he first trained in judo before starting karate in 1969 at the Blackfriers club in London, where he trained under Keinosuke Enoeda, Hirokazu Kanazawa, Kato and Takahashi.In 1977 Hazard went to Japan where he studied in Japan Karate Association (JKA) instructor classes under Masatoshi Nakayama.In 1982 Mick Dewey formed the South of England Karate Union (SEKU).  Dewey had been good friends with Hazard for many years and in 1985 invited Hazard to join himself and Mervyn O'Donnell in The South of England Karate Union.  At this time Hazard lived in Leyton, East London, and Dewey arranged for him to join the Brighton Karate Club (Dewey had formed the club with Phil Elliott in 1974). Hazard accepted the invitation and moved from London to Brighton where he ran the club for nineteen years, serving as Technical Director and Grading Examiner to SEKU until he left and moved to Nottingham.\nLater The 'South of England Karate Union' was renamed The Shotokan of England Karate Union. The Brighton Karate Club is now run by Jess Lavender a 7th Dan.\nHazard later left SEKU and is now the chief instructor of an international association in the form of the Academy of Shotokan Karate, which he founded in 2003, feeling in need of an environment that would allow him personally to evolve his approach to Shotokan Karate-Do. He is assisted within the ASK by senior instructors and karate-ka like Jeff Westgarth, Jess Lavender, Paul Herbert and Juli Pops. He is also the former kata coach for the English national squad, due to the restructuring of the EKGB. He brings to many training courses his expertise in kata and their applications to differing situations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Japan Karate Association", "response": ["Karateka such as Dave Hazard (UK), Ennio Vezzuli (Brazil), Nigel Jackson (South Africa), Pet\u00e9 Pacheco (Portugal), Malcolm Fisher (Canada), Leon Montoya (Colombia), Richard Amos (UK, US), Pascal Lesage (France) and others, are mentioned in karate forums as having completed the JKA instructors' course (or having had substantial participation in it) but do not appear on the list of graduates as published in 2008 on the JKA's website."]}, {"page": "List of karateka", "response": ["*Dave Hazard (born 1952), Shotokan"]}, {"page": "Terry O'Neill (martial artist)", "response": ["*Dave Hazard"]}, {"page": "Ticky Donovan", "response": ["On 28 March 2009, Karate England held a testimonial evening for Donovan, with many senior karateka present, including Steve Arneil, Dave Hazard, Tyrone Whyte, and Aiden Trimble."]}, {"page": "Shotokan of England Karate Union", "response": ["The Shotokan of England Karate Union was founded by Sensei Mick Dewey in 1982 when through circumstance he felt unable to continue his relationship with the KUGB.The Shotokan Way Magazine Originally named the South of England Karate Union, a change to Shotokan of England Karate Union was necessary when some northern English clubs joined. In 1984, due to the Unions growth, Mick Dewey invited his friend Dave Hazard (Hazard was a regular visiting instructor at Brighton Shotokan) to join as technical director of the SEKU. The HQ (Hombu) dojo for SEKU is Portsmouth Karate Club where Mick teaches to this day having begun teaching there in 1972. Mick and Phil Elliott founded many clubs around the south of England and in fact in his own words every karate club in the south of England currently owes its roots to the Portsmouth dojo and SEKU. Brighton Shotokan was founded in June 1974 by Mick Dewey and Phil Elliott at the Sussex Sports Centre, Queens Square, Brighton. Phil Elliott stopped training around 1978/9 and Mick Dewey continued running the club then around 1980 he handed the responsibilities to club members Greg Wedekind, Will Davies, John Cave and Paul Bonnet, they continued running the club until the arrival of Dave Hazard.   At the invitation by Mick Dewey and the agreement of the four instructors, Dave Hazard was offered the full-time teaching position at the Brighton club.For SEKU, to be a grading examiner, Hazard had to be running his own club so this fulfilled two goals, high quality regular instruction in Brighton and a Grading Examiner. Dave Hazard moved to Brighton in 1985 and built the club into an elite training ground for adults, mainly black and brown belts. Dave Hazard worked within SEKU until 2003 when he left to found the Academy of Shotokan Karate."]}, {"page": "Keinosuke Enoeda", "response": ["Enoeda and his wife, Reiko (married in 1969), settled in Kingston, Surrey.
