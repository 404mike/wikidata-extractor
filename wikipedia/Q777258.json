After studying medicine he qualified M.R.C.S. in 1881.He made several pioneer contributions to British neurophysiology. With his brother-in-law, Victor Horsley (1857\u20131916), he performed research involving localization of brain function via electrical stimulation of the cortex, and also demonstrated that the mammalian brain was capable of producing electric current.\nIn 1899 he described the \"inexcitable\" or \"refractory phase\" that takes place between nerve impulses. He also performed significant research in the field of electroretinography.\nIn 1891, with Horsley, he delivered the Croonian Lecture before the Royal Society of London, entitled \"On The Mammalian Nervous System: Its Functions, And Their Localization Determined By An Electrical Method\". In June 1892 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal SocietyHis body was interred at Wolvercote Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Victor Horsley", "response": ["In June 1886 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society  and in 1891 delivered their Croonian Lecture, jointly with his brother-in-law Francis Gotch, on the subject of the mammalian nervous system.

His technique was used by Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine, the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron. Golgi and Ram\u00f3n y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. The hypotheses of the neuron doctrine were supported by experiments following Galvani's pioneering work in the electrical excitability  of muscles and neurons. In 1898, British scientist John Newport Langley first coined the term \"autonomic\" in classifying the connections of nerve fibers to peripheral nerve cells. Langley is known as one of the fathers of the chemical receptor theory, and as the origin of the concept of \"receptive substance\". Towards the end of the nineteenth century Francis Gotch conducted several experiments on nervous system function. In 1899 he described the \"inexcitable\" or \"refractory phase\" that takes place between nerve impulses. His primary focus was on how nerve interaction affected the muscles and eyes."]}, {"page": "Richard Caton", "response": ["Caton worked as part-time Professor of Physiology from 1882 to 1891.

It wasn't until 1904 where should would be working alongside John Scott Haldane to determine the role of carbon dioxide in disease where she would meet William Osler, the father of modern medicine. Mabel was invited by Osler to help him establish a medical training program at Radcliff Infirmary. As a couple years passed, Mabel found herself as a research fellow at the new Rockefeller Institute in New York City. Once there, Mabel befriended Canadian fellow Maud Menten and both relocated to the University of Toronto. There, she modified the histological method and proved the origin of hydrochloric acid in the parietal cells of gastric tubules. After completing her research, Mabel returned to New York in hopes of earning her medical degree from Oxford. Her 1500 hours in the medical curriculum and three years of clinical training with Osler proved to be insufficient as the University of Oxford did not award medical degrees to women at the time. The New York Board of Regents decided that Mabel should attend an American high school due to them claiming Mabel's extensive English education was insufficient for her to receive her medical degree.
