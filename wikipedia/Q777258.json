After studying medicine he qualified M.R.C.S. in 1881.He made several pioneer contributions to British neurophysiology. With his brother-in-law, Victor Horsley (1857\u20131916), he performed research involving localization of brain function via electrical stimulation of the cortex, and also demonstrated that the mammalian brain was capable of producing electric current.\nIn 1899 he described the \"inexcitable\" or \"refractory phase\" that takes place between nerve impulses. He also performed significant research in the field of electroretinography.\nIn 1891, with Horsley, he delivered the Croonian Lecture before the Royal Society of London, entitled \"On The Mammalian Nervous System: Its Functions, And Their Localization Determined By An Electrical Method\". In June 1892 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal SocietyHis body was interred at Wolvercote Cemetery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
