Former Grand National jockeys, Richard Pitman and Bill Smith. Both Pitman and Smith made heavy reference throughout toward the loose horse Lucky Rew who continued riderless after a first fence fall for the duration of the race by repeatedly stating that the horse would not do it if it didn't like it. This was viewed by elements in the press as an attempt to deflect attention from the fall of Dark Ivy, which received only scant mention during the rerun, pointing out that horses are, by nature herd animals and that a loose horse has a natural inclination to follow a herd of other horses. Such heavy comment about loose horses as a proof the horses are enjoying what they do became increasingly unfashionable in the decade that followed and is now rarely commented on. The race was also broadcast live on The BBC Radio Two show, Saturday Sport, which had broadcast every Grand National live since 1927.
