Brook scored England's only goal, from a Crooks centre, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Wales. In a 3\u20130 victory against Scotland Brook set up Bastin to score England's first goal and scored England's second via a twenty-five yard free-kick. England came second that year to Wales. In a 4\u20131 victory against France in December 1933, Brook scored from a left-footed free-kick into the corner of the goal and also set up Tom Grosvenor to score England's fourth goal. Brook struck the ball from his free kick 'so hard that the ball rebounded from the net back on to the field'. Brook also scored once for the 'Rest of England' in a 7\u20131 victory in a trial match against the England team at Roker Park in March 1934. In Sunderland 'the scoreline became more popularly known as England 1 Sunderland 6' as six of the rest's goals were scored by Sunderland players. In a 2\u20131 defeat to Czechoslovakia, in May 1934, Brook was described as 'the pick of the English forwards'. In October 1934, Brook scored twice for The Football League XI in a 2\u20131 victory against the Scottish Football League XI.", "In the 1936 British Home Championship, Brook, Ralph Birkett and Tilson each scored in a 3\u20131 victory over Ireland at Windsor Park. In the game against Scotland, Brook was part of an England forward line which included Sammy Crooks, Bobby Barclay, George Camsell and Cliff Bastin. The result was a 1\u20131 draw, which meant that Scotland won the championship that season. In the same year, Brook scored in the 6\u20132 demolition of Hungary. Brook replaced Stoke City's Joe Johnson in the team when he withdrew from the squad due to an injury. One Scottish journalist stated that the 'Hungarians played the prettiest football' and that the score-line was a 'crying injustice'. Another journalist stated that England's wingers, Sammy Crooks and Brook, contributed powerfully to the victory, that Brook constantly did the right thing and that his goal was a gem. A different journalist stated that 'on the extreme left Brook was the opportunist that he always is, and, like Drake, ever a potential matchwinner'. A journalist for the Nottingham Journal stated that Brook and Carter were the best forwards in the second half and that 'they had some splendid passing bouts'. Ted Drake scored a hat-trick in the game and Cliff Britton and Raich Carter scored England's other goals. Drake's second goal was scored from a corner taken by Brook."]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 in English football", "response": ["3 February 1981: Sammy Crooks, 73, played 408 league games on the right wing for Derby County between 1927 and 1947 after signing from Durham City.

In Johnson's first full season Everton won the Second Division Championship, and in his second the club won the First Division, becoming the English champions. The following season Everton reached the 1933 FA Cup Final, where Johnson faced his former club Manchester City. Everton were comfortable victors, winning 3\u20130, and seven years after suffering defeat in an FA Cup final Johnson gained a winners medal. Accounts of the match suggest Johnson had a quiet game, with reports focusing on the play of Dixie Dean and Cliff Britton. The final was the first to use shirt numbers to identify the players, Johnson becoming the competition's first number 10.James, The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame, p.\u00a025.

City took the lead early in the match following a solo goal by Tilson. In the second-half Burnley discarded their passing game in favour of a direct approach, and pressured the Manchester City goal. The City defence stood firm, and the match finished 1\u20130. City's opponents for the semi-final, held at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, were Derby County. Derby had two chances to score in the first half, but both were missed. A Manchester City counter-attack produced the opening goal, when Brook crossed and Toseland headed in. By midway through the second half Manchester City led by three goals. The second was scored by Tilson, a follow-up after an initial saved shot. McMullan scored the third after dribbling through the Derby defence. Derby mounted a late comeback. A goal by Howard Fabian reduced the deficit to two, and Sammy Crooks added a late second for Derby, but it was too late to affect the result of the match, which ended 3\u20132."]}, {"page": "Miles Addison", "response": ["Derby's poor start to the 2008\u201309 season saw Addison given a chance to cement a place in the first team and he was given his first start of the campaign in the 1\u20130 League Cup win at Preston North End on 26 August 2008. Starting in his preferred position of central midfield for the first time, Addison impressed enough to retain his place for the subsequent match away to Barnsley. This was the start of a run of 15 consecutive appearances in the first team, which was only ended when suspension for reaching five yellow cards ruled him out of the League Cup 4th round tie against Leeds United. Addison formed a formidable midfield partnership with Paul Green during this time as the Rams embarked on a run of only two defeats in 13 matches and moved from the bottom of the table to the fringes of the playoff places. Addison's form earned high praise from Jewell as an example to the club's other academy players and saw him sign a new three-and-a-half-year deal with the club on 2 September to keep him at the club until 2011. November saw Addison linked with a \u00a32 million move to Premier League Stoke. However, Jewell denied this, saying \"I spoke to Tony (Pulis, Stoke manager) about another matter and he never mentioned it. We are not going to sell Miles Addison. He won't be getting sold. Everybody has their price I guess, but we have worked too hard over the past year and gone through too many tortures to now start selling our best players\". Addison was denied his first goal for the club in the controversial East Midlands derby on 2 November 2008 when Stuart Attwell incorrectly ruled two late Addison headers which would have given Derby a 2\u20131 win, with the match instead finishing 1\u20131. but eventually got his first professional goal with the second in a 3\u20130 home win over Sheffield Wednesday on 15 November 2008. On 20 December 2008, he captained the side for the whole game against Watford, as the result ended in a 1\u20130 win. Addison said \"it was a dream to captain the side who I support\". Addison was substituted during Derby's 4\u20131 win over Blackpool, an injury which was later diagnosed to be a stress fracture of his foot, which ruled him out for the rest of the 2008\u201309 season. Despite missing the latter part of the campaign Addison's form was such that he won the Sammy Crooks Trophy \u2013 Derby County's Young Player of the Season award \u2013 for the 2008\u201309 season.", "*Derby County's Sammy Crooks Young Player of the Year Award : 2008\u201309"]}]}}
