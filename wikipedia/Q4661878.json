Darlington goalkeeper Sam Russell had to be alert early on to clear an Adam Murray pass which had sent Duncan Russell clean through on goal. At the other end, Alan Marriott did well to punch away a corner from Aaron Brown before Liam Hatch could get his head on it. In the 18th minute, a Mansfield corner was met by the head of former Darlington captain Steve Foster, but the ball sailed well over the bar. On 32 minutes, Gary Smith broke into the Mansfield, where he appeared to be brought down by Louis Briscoe. Referee Stuart Attwell, who was well placed, waved away the penalty appeals. Darlington suffered a blow on 38 minutes when Smith, who had been lively in midfield, limped off to be replaced by Aman Verma. The first half of the match concluded with the score at 0\u20130.", "As a penalty shoot-out loomed over the match, Darlington created one last chance. In the 119th minute, an Aaron Brown long throw was flicked on by Miller and found Wright, who got to the ball ahead of Marriott to send a looping header towards the Mansfield goal. The ball hit the bar before falling to Chris Senior who headed into the roof of the net to send the Darlington fans into raptures and secure an FA Trophy final victory for Darlington.", "|DF ||25|| Aaron Brown"]}, {"page": "Aaron Brown", "response": ["Aaron Brown may refer to:", "* Aaron Brown (defensive lineman) (1943\u20131997), American football player", "* Aaron Brown (running back) (born 1985), American football player", "* Aaron Brown (linebacker) (born 1956), American NFL and CFL linebacker", "* Aaron Brown (footballer, born 1980), English footballer who plays as a midfielder for Darlington", "* Aaron Brown (footballer, born 1983), English footballer who played for Preston North End", "* Aaron Brown (sprinter) (born 1992), Canadian sprinter", "* Aaron Brown (rugby league) (born 1992), British rugby league player", "* Aaron Brown (1883\u20131934), Hall of Fame Boxer, better known as Dixie Kid", "* Aaron Brown (journalist) (born 1948), American broadcast journalist", "* Aaron Brown (financial author) (born 1956), American financial author and professor", "* Aaron Brown (musician) (born 1980), Australian-American violinist and composer", "* Aaron Brown (1987\u20132006),  fatally shot by police officer, Alexandria, VA"]}, {"page": "Aaron Brown (footballer born 1980)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Aaron Brown (footballer, born 1980)"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Lincoln City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|3||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Aaron Brown"]}]}}
