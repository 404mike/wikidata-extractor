He is the current manager of Cardiff City.\nMorison started his career at Northampton Town at the age of 16, progressing through the club's centre of excellence. He made his first-team debut in 2002. Morison joined Conference South club Bishop's Stortford for an undisclosed fee in November 2004. After just under two years playing regularly at Stortford, he signed for Stevenage Borough for a \"small four-figure fee\" in August 2006. During his first season with the club, Morison scored the winning goal in the 2007 FA Trophy Final, the first competitive cup final to be held at the new Wembley Stadium. He also helped the club win the FA Trophy again in May 2009, in what was ultimately his last game for the club.\nHaving scored 86 times in 151 appearances during his three seasons at Stevenage, Morison joined Millwall for \u00a3130,000 ahead of the 2009\u201310 season. He helped the club to secure promotion to the Championship in his first season there. He signed for Premier League club Norwich City in June 2011. After scoring 12 goals in 59 games for Norwich in the top tier of English football, Morison signed for Leeds United in January 2013. He rejoined Millwall on a season-long loan after just five months at Leeds. He returned to Leeds for the 2014\u201315 season, before signing for Millwall on a permanent basis in August 2015.\nMorison scored the winning goal in the 2017 EFL League One play-off Final to help Millwall achieve promotion back into the Championship during the 2016\u201317 season. He played over 300 games for Millwall over his two spells with the club, scoring 92 goals, which ranks him in third place in Millwall's all-time record goalscorers list. Morison joined Shrewsbury Town on an initial season-long loan agreement in June 2019. Although the transfer was made permanent at the start of the 2019\u201320 season, Morison announced his retirement from playing in October 2019. Having already gained his coaching badges, he was appointed Northampton Town's under-18 coach, before later joining Cardiff City as the lead coach of the club's under-23 team.\nMorison also earned eight caps for the England C team, scoring three goals. Morison qualified to play Wales through his Welsh ancestry, and made his senior international debut in August 2010. He went on to represent Wales 20 times, scoring one goal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Millwall F.C.", "response": ["In the 2016\u201317 FA Cup, Millwall reached the Quarter-finals for the tenth time in their history, knocking out Premier League opposition in three consecutive rounds: Bournemouth in the third round, Watford in the fourth round, and reigning Premier League champions Leicester City in the fifth round. On 28 February 2017, Millwall beat Peterborough United 1\u20130 and increased their unbeaten run to 16 games in all competitions, and have gone nine games without conceding a goal for the first time since the 1925\u201326 season. Millwall made it to the League One play-off final at Wembley for the second successive year, after beating Scunthorpe United 3\u20132 in the semi-final. They were promoted back to the Championship following a 1\u20130 playoff final victory over Bradford City, thanks to an 85th-minute winner from Steve Morison, his 86th goal for the club. In Millwall's return to the Championship in the 2017\u201318 season the team went on a club record 17-game unbeaten run; their longest streak in the second tier, which surpassed a record of 15 set in 1971. During the undefeated run they won six away wins in a row, equalling a club record set in the 2008\u201309 season. In the 2018\u201319 FA Cup, Millwall once again reached the Quarter-finals for an 11th time, only losing to Premier League side Brighton on penalties.

Ten days after performing the unusual feat of scoring twice in a penalty shoot-out as Bradford City lost 11\u201310 to Accrington Stanley, McMahon scored two penalties in a 3\u20131 win against Coventry City before tearing a thigh muscle that kept him out until Christmas. He continued in the starting eleven, and scored twice in the penultimate match of the season, a 3\u20130 win against AFC Wimbledon that confirmed Bradford City's qualification for the play-offs. Rory McArdle scored the only goal of the semi-final against Fleetwood Town from McMahon's corner, but they lost in the final to a late Steve Morison goal for Millwall. With his contract due to expire and amid interest from clubs including Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers and Preston North End, McMahon delayed accepting an offer to stay with Bradford City, but in early July, he signed for another year.
