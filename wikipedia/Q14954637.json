He is best known for his promotion of naturalistic planting design in gardens and designed landscapes (e.g. the 1996 publication of 'The New Perennial Garden', pub. Frances Lincoln, London),  and his collaboration with Dutch garden and landscape designer Piet Oudolf on books on planting design. He writes occasionally for The Daily Telegraph, Gardens Illustrated magazine and The Garden - the membership magazine of the Royal Horticultural Society. He has worked with Prof. Nigel Dunnett, of the University of Sheffield on the first book in English on green roof and related 'green architecture' technologies.\nIn collaboration with Tim Richardson Kingsbury has edited Vista, the Culture and Politics of Gardens and co-chairs events at the Garden Museum in London under the title 'Vista'. He has worked with several notable garden photographers, such as Marianne Majerus and Andrea Jones.\nKingsbury earned a doctorate from the University of Sheffield in 2009, for a thesis on the Long term performance of ornamental herbaceous vegetation. He continues to research in this area.Kingsbury has also written a history of plant breeding, Hybrid, The History and Science of Plant Breeding (2009).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vandana Shiva", "response": ["Stewart Brand in Whole Earth Discipline described some of Shiva's statements as pseudo-scientific, calling her warnings about \"heritable sterility\" (Stolen Harvest, 2000) a \"biological impossibility\" but also plagiarism from Geri Guidetti, owner of the seed supplier company Ark Institute, and a \"distraction\" created by inflating the potential of terminator genes based on a single 1998 patent granted to a US company. Brand also criticised the position of anti-GMO activists, including Shiva, who forced Zambia's government to reject internationally donated corn in 2001-02 because it was \"poisoned\", as well as during the cyclone disaster in India. On the latter Shiva argued, \"emergency cannot be used as market opportunity\", to which Brand responded, \"anyone who encourages other people to starve on principle should do some of the starving themselves\". In 1998 Shiva was also protesting against Bt cotton program in India, calling it \"seeds of suicide, seeds of slavery, seeds of despair\", claiming she was protecting the farmers. Restrictive laws established in India under anti-GMO lobbying, however, led to widespread grassroots \"seed piracy\" where Indian farmers illegally planted seeds of Bt cotton and Bt brinjal, obtained either from experimental plantations or from Bangladesh (where they are planted legally) due to increased yield and reduced pesticide usage. As of 2005 over 2.5 million hectares were planted with \"unofficial\" Bt cotton in India, of which Noel Kingsbury said:"]}, {"page": "Sevenoaks School", "response": ["* Noel Kingsbury, writer on gardening and plant science"]}, {"page": "Piet Oudolf", "response": ["* Designing With Plants (1999) with Noel Kingsbury", "* Planting the Natural Garden (2003) with Henk Gerritsen, revised (2019) with Noel Kingsbury; Originally published in the Netherlands under the title Droomplanten (1992)", "* Planting Design: Gardens in Time and Space (2005) with Noel Kingsbury", "* Landscapes in Landscapes (2011) with Noel Kingsbury", "* Planting: A New Perspective (2013) with Noel KingsburyPlanting: A New Perspective, Timber Press.
