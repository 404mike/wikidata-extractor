The game, played on 8 January 2006, ended as a 0\u20130 draw, with Burton deservedly earning a replay through the draw. The Brewers were the better team in the first half, with Phil Bardsley clearing headers off the line from Jon Shaw and skipper Darren Stride. United struggled on a heavy pitch, although Wayne Rooney twice forced saves from Burton goalkeeper Saul Deeney after coming on as a substitute. And in injury time, Deeney dramatically saved Ritchie Jones' low strike. A late winner for United would have been cruel on Burton, who held firm in the second half as the Premier League side pressed forward."]}, {"page": "John Taylor High School", "response": ["* Darren Stride \u2013 former Burton Albion footballer"]}, {"page": "Darren stride", "response": ["#REDIRECT Darren Stride "]}, {"page": "Richard Knight (footballer)", "response": ["Knight was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire.
