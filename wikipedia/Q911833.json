In the case of the Netherlands, he argues that \"the whole cause of the disagreement was the feeling of some Dutchman ... that it mattered what all the inhabitants of the country believed. Demands for policies aimed at producing religious or secular uniformity presuppose a concern ... for the state of grace of one's fellow citizens\". He contrasts this to the case of a society marked by conflict, in this case Northern Ireland, where he argues that \"the inhabitants ... have never shown much worry about the prospects of the adherents of the other religion going to hell\".

Such people are not powerful in the sense they have resources that they could use that other groups do not (though they might have this power 'as well') but rather systematically lucky in that they tend to get what they want without having to do anything.

From the \"weak\" perspective, intergenerational equity would be achieved if losses to the environment that future generations face were offset by gains in economic progress (e.g. and if this widely increases living standards and is only achievable via ways that damage the environment). From the \"strong\" perspective, no amount of economic progress can justify leaving future generations with a degraded environment. According to Professor Sharon Beder, the \"weak\" perspective is undermined by a lack of knowledge of the future, as we do not know which intrinsically valuable resources will not be able to be replaced by technology.Sharon Beder, 'Costing the Earth: Equity, Sustainable Development and Environmental Economics', New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law, 4, 2000, pp. 227-243. We also do not know to what extent environmental damage is irreversible. Further, more harm cannot be avoided to many species of plants and animals. Other scholars contest Beder's point of view. Professor Wilfred Beckerman insists that \"strong sustainability\" is \"morally repugnant\", particularly when it overrides other moral concerns about those alive today.Beckerman, Wilfred. \"'Sustainable Development': Is it a Useful Concept?\" Environmental Values 3, no. 3, (1994): 191\u2013209. . Beckerman insists that the optimal choice for society is to prioritize the welfare of current generations above future generations. He suggests placing a discount rate on outcomes for future generations when accounting for generational equity. Beckerman is extensively criticized by Brian BarryBrian Barry, 'Sustainability and Intergenerational Justice', in Dobson (1999) (Ed) Fairness and Futurity. and Nicholas Vrousalis.Nicholas Vrousalis, 'Intergenerational Justice: A Primer', Institutions for Future Generations, Gosseries, A. & I.
