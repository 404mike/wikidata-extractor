From 1889 to 1902 he was a lecturer in History and Economics at Leeds University and was Professor of Economics there from 1902 to 1908. He was the first Professor of Economic History at Cambridge University from 1928 to 1938, and Vice-Provost of King's College, Cambridge from 1933 until 1943 when he received a knighthood.\nBetween 1926 and 1938 he published, in three volumes, An Economic History of Modern Britain. He is also recognised for his study of the Industrial Revolution in England, and for describing cooperatives in the initiation of the revolution.  He is also remembered for his 1944 The Bank of England, A History.Welsh economic historian Sir John Habakkuk was one of his students. One of Clapham's more notable quotations is: \"Economic advance is not the same thing as human progress\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Industrial Revolution", "response": ["Some historians, such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts, have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually, and that the term revolution is a misnomer.

It ceased to be legal currency for  \u00a31 if found to weigh less than 122 grains (i.e. a deficiency of 1 pence in gold per sovereign). By the early 1840s, the Bank of England estimated that twenty per cent of the gold coins that came into its hands were lightweight. In part to boost the sovereign's reputation in trade, the Bank undertook a programme of recoinage, melting lightweight gold coins and using the gold for new, full-weight ones. Between 1842 and 1845, the Bank withdrew and had recoined some \u00a314million in lightweight gold, about one-third the amount of that metal in circulation. This not only kept the sovereign to standard, it probably removed most of the remaining guineas still in commerce. The unlucky holder of a lightweight gold coin could only turn it in as bullion, would lose at least 1 pence because of the lightness and often had to pay an equal amount to cover the Bank of England's costs. There was also increased quality control within the Royal Mint; by 1866, every gold and silver coin was weighed individually. The result of these efforts was that the sovereign became, in Sir John Clapham's later phrase, the \"chief coin of the world\"."]}, {"page": "Mont Pelerin Society", "response": ["In 1947, thirty-nine scholars, mostly economists with some historians and philosophers, were invited by Friedrich Hayek to meet to discuss the state and possible fate of classical liberalism, his goal being an organization which would resist interventionism and promote his conception of classical liberalism. He wanted to discuss how to combat the \"state ascendancy and Marxist or Keynesian planning [that was] sweeping the globe\". The first meeting took place in the Hotel du Parc in the Swiss village of Mont P\u00e8lerin, near the city of Vevey, Switzerland. Funding for the conference came from various sources including the William Volker Fund thanks to Harold Luhnow and the Bank of England owing to the help of Alfred Suenson-Taylor.

F. Crick and J. E. Wadsworth's research on joint-stock banking. Subsequent on the early-modern period began in the 1950s/1960s, covering topics such as bills of exchange, the English financial revolution, and Italian merchant bankers. One challenge to its growth was the growing split between academics in history and in economic history. From the late 1950s, economic history increasingly became a sub-field of economics, rather than of history. This change also coincided with the growing use of quantitative models and cliometric analysis. Meanwhile, historians began to combine the study of economic and social phenomena through the methodologies founded by the Annales School in France. This new discipline paved the way for Economic and Social History programmes, common at universities in the United Kingdom and Europe. As such, financial history, since the 1980s, remained a comparatively small sub-field compared to other sub-disciplines, like economic history and business history."]}, {"page": "Michael Clapham (industrialist)", "response": ["Clapham (born on 17 January 1912), the son of Sir John Clapham, who was Vice-Provost and Professor of Economic History at King's College, Cambridge.
