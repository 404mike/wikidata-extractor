Chesterton had been preoccupied with a legal case over the estate of his financial benefactor, the Chile-based millionaire Robert K. Jeffrey, who had seemingly left two contradictory wills, but Chesterton's fervour for politics had been rekindled by his discovery of the relative ease of funding a political party and by the emergence of Edward Martell, a right-wing libertarian who had garnered a reputation as an excellent fund-raiser and whose methods, if not politics, had impressed Chesterton greatly. By the spring of 1966, Chesterton had begun sounding out the likes of Bean, Tyndall and even Jordan about the possibility of building a united front on the far right."]}, {"page": "St George's School, Harpenden", "response": ["|Edward Martell (politician)"]}, {"page": "National Fellowship", "response": ["The party was launched under Chairman Edward Martell on 1 January 1962, with full page advertisements in national broadsheets.
