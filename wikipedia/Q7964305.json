In both cases, the offer was withdrawn owing to Carmichael's unhappiness with the publisher's plans, and his determination to see the collection through the press on his own terms and according to his own design. Much of the final editing was carried out after Carmichael's retirement from the Inland Revenue in December 1897, with the help of a team of assistants including his daughter Ella Carmichael and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s George Henderson (1866\u20131912), who gave the work its title, and Kenneth MacLeod (1871\u20131955). The initial letters, adapted from early medieval insular manuscripts and engraved stones, were illustrated by Carmichael's wife Mary Frances Macbean (1838\u20131928). The book itself, dedicated to Mary Frances, was published in two volumes in October 1900, under the auspices of Walter Biggar Blaikie (1847\u20131928) in a limited edition of 300 copies, costing 3 guineas a copy. Carmina Gadelica was a landmark in Scottish art publishing, intended not just as a treasury of lore, but as an object of beauty in itself.Campbell, John Lorne. \"Carmina Gadelica: George Henderson\u2019s corrections and suggestions\", Scottish Gaelic Studies, xiii(2) (1981), pp. 183\u2013216; Sti\u00f9bhart, \"Alexander Carmichael and Carmina Gadelica\", pp. 21\u20132; Sugg, Laura. \"The experience of God in everyday life in Alexander Carmichael\u2019s Carmina Gadelica\" (University of Edinburgh, unpublished Ph.D. thesis, 1997), pp. 53\u20138, 275\u201387."]}, {"page": "Lady Anne Mackintosh", "response": ["*Walter Biggar Blaikie, Itinerary of Prince Charles Edward Stuart . . ., Scottish Academic Press, Edinburgh, 1975.

Campbell won the battle, but Sinclair later turned to the law and was awarded the lands and title as Earl of Caithness.
