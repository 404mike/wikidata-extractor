The programme discussed the 2011 England riots. Starkey condemned \"this language which is wholly false, which is this Jamaican patois that\u2019s been intruded in England, and this is why so many of us have this sense of literally a foreign country\", that listening to the voice of the black MP for Tottenham where the riots occurred \"you would think he was white\", and that \"The whites have become black. A particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic, gangster culture\".", "The comments were heavily criticised by MPs and other renowned media presenters, and described as a \"career ending moment\". He was criticised by fellow panellist Dreda Say Mitchell for focusing on \"black culture\", since \"Black communities are not homogenous. So there are black cultures. Lots of different black cultures\". The then-leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, spoke about Starkey's remarks, saying that \"they are racist comments, frankly\". The author Toby Young, blogging in the Telegraph, defended Starkey by claiming that Starkey had been talking not about black culture in general. The Spectator columnist Rod Liddle argued in support of the remarks. Jones described the comments as \"one of the ugliest episodes of the backlash\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Starkey argued his views had been distorted, he referred only to a \"particular sort\" of \"black culture\", and that the \"black educationalists\" Tony Sewell and Katharine Birbalsingh supported the substance of his Newsnight comments."]}, {"page": "CWA New Blood Dagger", "response": ["*2005 \u2013\tDreda Say Mitchell, Running Hot"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Ed Miliband, David Davis, Caroline Lucas, Steve Hilton, Dreda Say Mitchell", "|Greg Clark, Diane Abbott, Bernard Hogan-Howe, Dreda Say Mitchell, Stuart Rose"]}, {"page": "2011 England riots", "response": ["The effects of black culture were discussed by historian David Starkey in the edition of the BBC's Newsnight TV programme of 12 August.
