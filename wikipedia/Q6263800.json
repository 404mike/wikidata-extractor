According to John White: \"The relatively schematic, linear quality of much late-thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century work is wholly absent.  The impressionistic technique and range of colour both derive from the fifth century. It is impossible to say how much this technique reflects the ideas of Giotto himself and how much those of the skilled mosaicists working under him. The two heads are, however, closely related both to the work of Cavallini, whose art still dominated the Roman scene, and to the basic type of physiognomy developed on the walls of the Arena Chapel.\"White, 332 (quoted); see also Calvesi, 40, and Paoletti & Radke, 65."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of The Courtauld Institute of Art", "response": ["* John White, art historian"]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John White, English art historian (b. 1924)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2021", "response": ["*John White, 97, British art historian.Births, marriages and deaths: November 16, 2021 "]}]}}
