Mickie Most used session musicians on many records he produced; this was industry practice at the time. Even respected groups such as the Yardbirds were required by Most to use session musicians (except Jimmy Page) on their Most-produced recordings.Davis, Stephen, Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga", "Continuing acrimony among former members of Herman's Hermits has increased the amount of disinformation about the group's role on their records; the late Derek Leckenby, in particular, was a skilled guitarist.

According to Hopwood, Green and Noone, Jimmy Page played on the single \"Wonderful World\" (although Big Jim Sullivan lists the song as part of a session he played); both may have added to the backing track.

Jimmy Page was working as a session guitarist at the time, and was a part of the recording sessions for the Goldfinger soundtrack.

Introduced by Danelectro in 1961, from a design by session guitarist Vinnie Bell, it was initially considered a cross between an electric guitar and a bouzouki rather than an electric version of the traditional 12-string guitar. In the UK in 1963, JMI briefly produced the Vox Bouzouki, later produced in Italy as The Vox Tempest XII, which was used by Vic Flick on the Peter and Gordon hit single \"A World Without Love\" in 1964. In late 1963, Burns developed the Double Six, supplying a prototype to Hank Marvin of The Shadows, who used it on a number of songs for the soundtrack of the 1964 Cliff Richard movie Wonderful Life; the Double Six was also used on The Searchers' cover version of De Shannon's \"When You Walk in the Room.\""]}, {"page": "Joe 90", "response": ["The theme and incidental music was composed by Barry Gray.

The song was based on the \"horn line\" from \"Goldfinger\", seen as an homage to the film of the same name, which required royalty payments to the original writers.
