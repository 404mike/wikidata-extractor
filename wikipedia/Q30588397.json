In 1935 Christie arranged for Konrad Henlein, the leader of the pro-Nazi Sudeten German Party, to visit London and meet with Vansittart. Henlein successfully used the visit to play the part of the reasonable statesman and convince the British to put pressure on Czechoslovak officials to accede to the demands of the Sudeten Germans.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Malcolm Grahame Christie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Grahame Christie"]}, {"page": "Graham Christie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Grahame Christie"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Blain", "response": ["Blain's PhD Thesis became the influential book Pilots and Management: Industrial Relations in the UK Airlines (1972).
