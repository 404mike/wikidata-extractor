He was Governor of Bengal from 19 February 1946 to 14 August 1947. Sir Frederick Burrows was against the partition of Bengal. Sir Frederick Burrows was a former Ross railway man and he was the president of the National Union of Railwaymen, the union representing railway workers in England.\nSir Adrian Carton de Wiart records: \"He had endeared himself to the Burrah Sahibs of Calcutta(Kolkata) with one of his first speeches when, alluding to his modest beginning on the railway, he said, 'When you gentlemen were huntin' and shootin', I was shuntin' and hootin'. He seemed to me to be far more proud of having been a sergeant-major in the Grenadier Guards in the First World War than he was of being Governor of Bengal.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
