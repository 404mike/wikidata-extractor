The Pitcairn Islands are a British Overseas Territory, mainly inhabited by Euronesians of British and Tahitian descent.\nThe culture held in common by most Pitcairn Islanders is mainstream Pitcairn culture, a mixture of British and Polynesian culture derived from the traditions of the settlers who landed in 1790. Most of the people today are descended from the HMS Bounty mutineers of English, Cornish, Manx and Scottish descent, plus their Tahitian companions, including the few who settled afterwards. As of 2018, there are a total of 50 people inhabiting the island.There is also a Pitcairn diaspora particularly in Norfolk Island, New Zealand and mainland Australia. Fearing overcrowding, in 1856 all 194 Pitkerners immigrated to Norfolk Island aboard the Morayshire (including a baby born en route) but 16 of them returned to Pitcairn on the Mary Ann in 1858, followed by a further four families in 1864.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norfolk Island", "response": ["=== Settlement by Pitcairn Islanders (1856present) ===", "The most important local holiday is Bounty Day, celebrated on 8 June, in memory of the arrival of the Pitcairn Islanders in 1856.", "This legal position is disputed by some residents on the island.

Pitcairn bees are also a placid variety and, within a short time, beekeepers are able to work with them wearing minimal protection. As a result, Pitcairn exports honey to New Zealand and to the United Kingdom. In London, Fortnum & Mason sells it and it is a favourite of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles. The Pitcairn Islanders, under the \"Bounty Products\" and \"Delectable Bounty\" brands, also export dried fruit including bananas, papayas, pineapples, and mangoes to New Zealand.Pitcairn Islands Study Center, News Release: Products from Pitcairn, 7 November 1999.

It is spoken as a first language by the population and is taught alongside English at the island's only school.
