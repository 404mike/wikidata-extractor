A single from the album, \"Are Friends Electric?\", topped the UK charts in the summer of 1979.

The group were revered by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Howard Jones, Alphaville, Book of Love and Ricky Wilde (songwriter/producer for Kim Wilde), and were also influential on New Order and Tears for Fears' exploration of electronic instruments. The band have garnered praise from other synth-pop peers including the Human League's Philip Oakey, Thompson Twins' Tom Bailey, Trevor Horn, and Gary Numan, who credited OMD for \"some of the best pop songs ever written\". Within the rock genre, the group influenced then-progressive band Spoons, and were championed by ZZ Top, who drew inspiration from OMD's use of synthesizers and onstage dancing."]}, {"page": "The Adam and Joe Show", "response": ["Dressed as policemen, Adam and Joe would raid rock stars' homes, then examine their record collections for embarrassing or surprising items. The star would then be forced to dance to the shameful discoveries. Victims included Frank Black, Gary Numan, Alexis Arquette, Tim Gane and L\u00e6titia Sadier, Symposium, Dave Navarro, Cerys Matthews, Nick Heyward, Thomas Dolby, Ray Manzarek of The Doors and Mark E. Smith of The Fall. In 2009, Adam revealed on their BBC 6 Music show that some of the stars' 'homes' were not actually their own."]}, {"page": "Minimoog", "response": ["The Minimoog became a staple of progressive rock. In the early 1970s, Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake & Palmer added the Minimoog to his modular 'Monster Moog' as an occasional part of his performances. Wakeman used five Minimoogs on stage so he could play different sounds without having to reconfigure them. It was also used by electronic artists such as Kraftwerk, who used it on their albums Autobahn (1974) and The Man-Machine (1978), and later by Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Gary Numan. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, it was widely used in the emerging disco genre by artists including Abba and Giorgio Moroder. In 2012, to celebrate Moog's birthday, Google created an interactive version of the Minimoog as its Google Doodle."]}]}}
