(1861-1927)", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Attewell", "wikipedia_page": {"main": "William Attewell (; commonly known as Dick Attewell) (12 June 1861 \u2013 11 June 1927) was a cricketer who played for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and England. Attewell was a medium pace bowler who was renowned for his extraordinary accuracy and economy. On the many sticky or crumbling pitches encountered in his prime Attewell could get on a great deal of spin so as to always beat the bat, whilst his accuracy would make slogging \u2013 the only way to make runs under such conditions \u2013 very difficult. He was responsible for the development of \"off theory\" \u2013 bowling wide of the off stump to a packed off-side field to frustrate batsmen on the rapidly improving pitches of the 1890s. At times Attewell was a useful batsman for his county, and he scored 102 against Kent in 1897.\nAgainst the fleet-footed Australian batsmen of his time, Attewell was fairly ineffective. Moreover, with bowlers such as Lohmann and J.T. Hearne available who could do all Attewell could, he had trouble maintaining his place at Test level despite all he did for Nottinghamshire and the Marylebone Cricket Club.\nAttewell first played for Nottinghamshire in 1881 as a result of a strike by senior players such as Alfred Shaw and Fred Morley. He bowled very well but did not establish himself until 1884 after Morley had died, when he took 100 wickets for less than thirteen runs each. From then on, Attewell was always in the front rank of English bowlers, and after Shaw dropped out of the Nottinghamshire eleven in early 1887 he became the undisputed leader of the county's attack. His first Ashes tour was modest, partly owing to the dry weather, but he continued improving in England \u2013 taking 9 for 23 against Sussex at Trent Bridge in 1886 \u2013 and toured Australia again in 1887/1888. He proved deadly in a wet La Ni\u00f1a season in minor games, but had no opportunity of showing his deadliness on a sticky wicket at the highest level because Lohmann and Briggs were so effective. However, Attewell's skill and economy, along with the brilliant batting of Shrewsbury, allowed Nottinghamshire to maintain their position as one of the top counties in first-class county cricket right up to the end of 1892.\nEven when Attewell became the MCC's chief bowler and increased his aggregate of wickets to around 150 from 1889 to 1892, he did not cement his Test spot, and improving pitches and a severe shortage of support bowling caused Attewell's average to blow out to 21 in 1893 \u2013 and his record of 111 wickets at 17.54 in 1894 was disappointing given how much the pitches helped a bowler of his type. Although for the following three years Attewell did remarkably well on all pitches considering Nottinghamshire had no other bowlers even approaching county standard, the great strength of English bowling meant he was not considered for a Test match after 1891. In 1898, Attewell's tireless bowling at last seemed to lose some of its sting, and he failed to reach 100 wickets for the first time in a decade. The extremely dry summer of 1899 showed Attewell's capacity to bowl and bowl all day really was no more: he took only 29 wickets at the extremely high (even on such pitches) cost of 34.62 \u2013 in county matches he took just 19 wickets for 38.73 each.\nAttewell retired at the end of 1899 (apart from an abortive appearance for MCC in August 1900) and became a first-class umpire. He continued in this role on a regular basis until 1909, and even umpired at Lord's in an emergency in 1911.\nHe was the first person in Test history to be dismissed for a king pair.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 11", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 William Attewell, English cricketer (b. 1861)"]}, {"page": "June 12", "response": ["*1861 \u2013 William Attewell, English cricketer and umpire (d. 1927)"]}, {"page": "1891 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Great Bowlers \u2013 William Attewell, J T Hearne, Frederick Martin, Arthur Mold, John Sharpe"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  William Attewell"]}, {"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|William Attewell|| 1,303"]}, {"page": "England cricket team", "response": ["*Best economy rate: 1.31\u00a0\u2013 William Attewell"]}, {"page": "Montague Druitt", "response": ["On 26 May 1884, Druitt was elected to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) on the recommendation of his fellow Butterflies player Charles Seymour, who proposed him, and noted fielder Vernon Royle, who seconded his nomination.Leighton, p. 38 One of the minor matches he played for MCC was with England bowler William Attewell against Harrow School on 10 June 1886.

Horan was selected as captain. His team consisted on nine debutants (five of whom never played Tests again). Australia lost the Test by 10 wickets. In the following Test, Horan, having been stripped of his captaincy duties, made a significant impact with the ball, returning figures of 6/40 from 37.1 four-ball overs in England's first innings at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Horan played his final Test on 21 March 1885. He scored a duck in the first innings and made 20 in the second before being bowled by William Attewell, and bowled three wicketless overs for five runs as England took an innings victory."]}, {"page": "1891 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five Great Bowlers) - William Attewell, J T Hearne, Frederick Martin, Arthur Mold, John Sharpe ", "|William Attewell || MCC, North of England, Nottinghamshire, Players || 28|| 7573 || 153 || 13.93"]}, {"page": "1892 English cricket season", "response": ["|William Attewell || Nottinghamshire || 16 || 4756 || 97 || 12.79", "|William Attewell || MCC, North of England, Nottinghamshire, Players || 26 || 7271 || 144 || 14.00"]}, {"page": "Alick Bannerman", "response": ["In the 28 Tests that Bannerman played from then until 1893, he scored 1,108 runs at an average of 23.03, without ever scoring a hundred.  He often found his steady defence coupled at the top of the order with the aggression of such partners as Hugh Massie, George Bonnor, Percy McDonnell and J.J. Lyons.  With Lyons at Sydney in the 1891/92 Ashes series, Bannerman played a crucial role in securing the Test (and thus the series) for Australia, who had trailed on the first innings by 163 runs.  In the home team's second innings, Lyons and Bannerman put on 174 for the first wicket in 7\u00bd hours, scoring 134 and 91 respectively.  Bannerman's knock spanned three days, scoring at a rate of twelve runs an hour.  As the bowlers of his time bowled almost twice the number of overs in an hour that they do now, his cumbersome scoring is astonishing.

However, not physically strong enough for the hotter climate and drier wickets of Australia, Flowers only rarely, as when taking five for 46 in the Third Test and eight for 31 in the first match on a rain-damaged wicket, lived up to his English form. He did maintain his form well enough to tour again in 1886\u201387, but this time Flowers did very little worthy of his reputation. Even at county level, Flowers was increasingly overshadowed, especially in dry weather, by the physically hardier William Attewell. Nor did his batting advance during a succession of wet summers, but in the dry season of 1893 Flowers reached a four-figure run aggregate for only the second time. In the process he played an innings of 130 against the touring Australians including Charles Turner, George Giffen and Hugh Trumble, and was thus unsuccessfully picked for his last Test at Lord's, where he made 35 but was omitted in favour of Johnny Briggs who was bowling immensely better at county level."]}, {"page": "Lionel Palairet", "response": ["Some of Palairet's early success can be attributed to his father, who paid the professionals Frederick Martin and William Attewell, both later Wisden Cricketers of the Year, to bowl at his two sons during the Easter holidays, to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season. During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club. At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition. Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at Cattistock in Dorset, and it was in the south west that he chose to play his cricket.
