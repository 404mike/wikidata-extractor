Pattenden worked as a session guitarist for Engelbert Humperdinck and Leapy Lee in the 1960s.He played in MMEB from its formation in 1971. Pattenden featured on seven Earth Band albums from their debut in 1972 to The Roaring Silence in 1976. Pattenden quit MMEB in 1977. In 1978, he teamed up with former MMEB drummer Chris Slade and vocalist Peter Cox, in the short lived Terra Nova.He has also played with Mungo Jerry, The King Earl Boogie Band, The Jackie Lynton Band, and The Nashville Teens.He is currently working as a PR consultant and manages CP Sound Limited an audio system and lighting design and installation company.In an interview by fellow former bandmate Chris Slade, Colin Pattenden was considered along with Cliff Williams to replace Mark Evans in AC/DC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manfred Mann", "response": ["However, the new group was short-lived and by 1971 after a second album (and an unreleased possibly incomplete third) they had disbanded and Mann had formed a new group. The original line-up of this new group consisted of Mick Rogers (guitar and vocals), Manfred Mann (organ, synthesizer and vocals), Colin Pattenden (bass guitar) and Chris Slade (drums and vocals). In its very earliest stages, the band was simply billed as 'Manfred Mann' and thus a continuation of the 1960s group. The quartet (as 'Manfred Mann') released their first single, Dylan's \"Please, Mrs. Henry\", in 1971. Their second single, Randy Newman's \"Living Without You\", was also released by 'Manfred Mann' in Europe, but by 'Manfred Mann's Earth Band' in the US, where the track became a minor chart hit.

In its very earliest stages, the band was sometimes billed as \"Manfred Mann\" and thus a continuation of the 1960s group, sometimes as \"Manfred Mann Chapter Three\" due to that being the most recent incarnation of Mann's career. The quartet released their first single, Bob Dylan's \"Please, Mrs. Henry\", in 1971, simply credited to \"Manfred Mann\". A debut album \"Stepping Sideways\" was recorded but not released because the band's style was rapidly maturing, and the group felt it wasn't representative of their live act anymore. In September 1971, a new name was chosen. Manfred Mann suggested a title containing \"band\" (which almost rhymes with \"Mann\") and after considering the likes of \"Arm Band\", \"Head Band\" and \"Elastic Band\", Chris Slade suggested \"Earth Band\", a name both related to the band's originally straightforward musical style and the ecological movement ongoing at the time.Greg Russo, Mannerisms \u2013 The five phases of Manfred Mann (Revised Edition), Crossfire Publications, 2011, , p.121", "Following these popular successes, the Earth Band released the album Watch (1978), which produced another UK hit single in \"Davy's on the Road Again\".

We were in London, I went to their apartment and they told me they wanted to get rid of Mark.  Him and Angus didn't see eye to eye.  They used to have a sort of tit-for-tat thing going, but nothing that I would have ever thought was going to be gig-threatening.\"  According to Browning, the Young brothers were seriously considering Colin Pattenden of Manfred Mann fame. Browning feared that Pattenden was too old and didn't fit the band's image, so he instead pushed for Englishman Cliff Williams, who had previously played with Home and Bandit. Williams, who could also sing background vocals, passed the audition and was asked to join the band.
