Vocals in trip hop are often female and feature characteristics of various singing styles including R&B, jazz and rock. The female-dominant vocals of trip hop may be partially attributable to the influence of genres such as jazz and early R&B, in which female vocalists were more common. However, there are notable exceptions: Massive Attack and Groove Armada collaborated with male and female vocalists, Tricky often features vocally in his own productions along with Martina Topley-Bird, and Chris Corner provided vocals for later albums with Sneaker Pimps."]}, {"page": "Sadism and masochism in fiction", "response": ["*The video for \"Missile\" (2004) by IAMX shows Chris Corner first bound-down to a chair and then handcuffed with leather straps while his ex-girlfriend Sue Denim acts as a dominatrix."]}, {"page": "Mill Hill School", "response": ["* Chris Corner, producer and songwriter"]}, {"page": "The Cooper Temple Clause", "response": ["Tom Bellamy is currently a member of Losers and the live drummer for White Belt Yellow Tag.
