There was one less voice actor in Noir than in Discworld II; however, the heavy amount of dialogue in the game led to more reuse of voice actors in comparison. Audio director Rob Lord also provided additional voices. Robbins, voice actress for every female character in the game, finished her lines in a one-day session. Brydon, who voiced the player character, took a \"grueling\" week to complete his lines, with the game's main delivery of important information being Lewton's hardboiled monologues. Paul Weir created the soundtrack for the game. Weir studied most of the noir films Discworld Noir drew on."]}, {"page": "Wipeout (video game)", "response": ["Wipeout was first released alongside the PlayStation in Europe in September 1995. It was the PlayStation's best-selling launch title in Europe. The game was released in the United States in November. The game went to number one in all the format charts, with over 1.5 million units of the franchise having been sold to date throughout Europe and North America. Wipeout was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1996. Because the company behind the PlayStation, Sony, owned the applicable rights to the last three tracks of the PlayStation version's soundtrack, new music was added for the Saturn version by Rob Lord and Mark Bandola. The Sega Saturn version was released by SoftBank in North America.", "The game's electronica soundtrack was mostly composed by Welsh video game music composer Tim Wright under the alias CoLD SToRAGE. Additional music tracks were licensed from more established electronica acts to create the soundtracks for the PAL and Saturn versions of the game, as well as the promotional album, Wipeout: The Music. Additional music featured in the PAL version of the PlayStation game include tracks from Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, and Orbital (also appearing on Wipeout: The Music), while the Saturn version includes three additional tracks by Rob Lord and Mark Bandola. Orbital's \"Wipeout (P.E.T.R.O.L.)\" was at least partially written before Burcombe met the musicians, and Leftfield's \"Afro Ride\" and The Chemical brothers' \"Chemical Beats\" are remixes of songs the artists had already recorded. The 1995 North American release, as well as the 1997 \"Greatest Hits\" reissue, only feature tracks by CoLD SToRAGE."]}, {"page": "Composer Rob Lord", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rob Lord (musician)"]}, {"page": "Robert Lord", "response": ["*Rob Lord (musician) (born 1966), London based musician and composer"]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Lambeth", "response": ["*Rob Lord, composer of music for films, TV and computer games"]}, {"page": "RCVR", "response": ["The music for RCVR was composed by British composer Rob Lord and recorded in London, Paris and Los Angeles in 2011.

Much of the composition and recording was started before filming commenced and was based on the script and discussions between Rob Lord and director David van Eyssen.
