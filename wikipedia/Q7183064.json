Chand\u00e9e was knighted on landing at Milford Haven. At the Battle of Bosworth the Yorkist King Richard led an impromptu cavalry charge deep into the enemy ranks in an attempt to end the battle quickly by striking at Henry Tudor himself, and it was only a complex tactical move taught by only the Swiss forces at the time, along with help from Thomas Stanley's intervention which saved Henry and killed Richard III.\nChand\u00e9e was one of the few who received a peerage from Henry VII, being created Earl of Bath, either on 16 October 1485, the day before the coronation, at the Tower of London, or on 6 January 1486.Nothing is known of him after he was created an Earl.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Earl of Bath", "response": ["*Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, 1st Earl of Bath (d. aft. 1486)"]}, {"page": "Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, Earl of Bath", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, 1st Earl of Bath"]}, {"page": "Philibert de Chand\u00e9e", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, 1st Earl of Bath"]}, {"page": "Philibert de Chandee", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, 1st Earl of Bath"]}, {"page": "Philibert de Chandee, 1st Earl of Bath", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, 1st Earl of Bath"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1480\u20131489", "response": ["|Earl of Bath (1486)||Philibert de Chand\u00e9e, 1st Earl of Bath||1486||14??||New creation; died, title extinct"]}]}}
