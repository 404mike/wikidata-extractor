Along with Eric Ashton the best centre I\u2019ve ever seen. He was very fast and very deceptive. You never knew what he would do next. He'd be running straight and then veer left or right.\" Upon Gasnier's retirement then ARL chairman Bill Buckley said, \"[In] his day, he was the greatest rugby league player I have ever seen.

In his last season as a player at Manly in 1962, Willey was captain-coach. He held the record for the most points scored at Manly until overtaken by Graeme Eadie in the 1970s, and during 1962 he overtook Bernie Purcell's record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL career (1,152); Willey's eventual total of 1,288 stood as the new career record for four seasons until it was bettered by Keith Barnes in 1966."]}]}}
