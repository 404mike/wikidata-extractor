The team struggled, losing five of their first six league games (a draw at Swansea on the opening day being the exception to the rule). One tactic that did work, however, was his moving Billy Tremelling from centre-forward back to half-back, which resulted in a fruitful partnership with Jimmy Hampson (a player Beaumont had brought to the seaside)."]}, {"page": "1937 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||5 || Billy Tremelling (c)"]}, {"page": "List of Blackpool F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Billy Tremelling"]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["Blackpool hosted Cardiff City on 12 October, and the home side made it three wins on the trot with a 3\u20130 scoreline.
