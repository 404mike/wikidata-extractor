The most influential early Arts and Crafts domestic work was Lethaby's The Hurst in Four Oaks of 1892 (since demolished), with major surviving works including Herbert Tudor Buckland's 1899 and 1901 houses in Yateley Road, Edgbaston; J. L Ball's Winterbourne of 1903, also in Edgbaston; and C. E. Bateman's Redlands of 1900 in Four Oaks. The dominance of Arts and Crafts culture among Birmingham's growing manufacturing, commercial and professional classes saw the development of a wide variety of detached suburban houses in upmarket districts such as Edgbaston, Moseley, Four Oaks, and Yardley, and outside the city boundaries in areas such as Barnt Green, Olton and Solihull, designed both by celebrated local Arts and Crafts architects and by less well-known but prolific local figures such as Owen Parsons, Thomas Walter Francis Newton & Alfred Edward Cheatle and William de Lacy Aherne."]}]}}
