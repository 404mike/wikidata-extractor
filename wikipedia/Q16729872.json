According to Drew Pearson, it was originally intended for Greg Holden, but was submitted to Idol as a possible finale number by Pearson's publishing company, Pulse Recordings.  Pearson and Holden had previously not met before but were brought together to write the song, with Holden the primary lyricist. The song was written in three hours  in Pearson's studio in Burbank, California in November 2011.  Originally it had only two verses, but an arrangement change was made about a month after it was written, and the second verse was repeated.  Pearson cited Mumford & Sons, Arcade Fire, and a few Irish bands as influences for the song. A demo was recorded, and Holden had performed the song in his tour, but he expressed no intention of releasing his recording of the song.  According to Holden, the song is about a friend who was going through a very difficult time, and it was his way of reaching out and saying that \"you know someone's here for you\".", "Category:Songs written by Greg Holden"]}, {"page": "The Exchange (band)", "response": ["| align=\"center\" | 4 || align=\"center\" | Home || align=\"center\" | 3:06 || align=\"center\" | Drew Pearson, Greg Holden"]}, {"page": "Live on the Green Music Festival", "response": ["| Greg HoldenThe Delta SaintsMoon Taxi"]}, {"page": "The World from the Side of the Moon", "response": ["Phillip Phillips began writing songs with collaborators and recording rough tracks for the album before the American Idol Tour began in July 2012.
