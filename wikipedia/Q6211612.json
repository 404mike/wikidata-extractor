First through the door was Joe Oastler on loan from Queens Park Rangers. Capable of playing as both a midfielder and defender, Oastler joined Torquay on a one-month deal. Later in the month, two more loan signings arrived at Plainmoor within twenty four hours of each other. Winger Romone Rose became the second loanee from Neil Warnock's QPR, signing a three-month deal, while the young Wolves striker Ashley Hemmings joined Torquay, like Oastler, on a one-month contract.", "No new additions were made to the squad during the month, although the loan deal for Joe Oastler was extended until January while Wolves agreed to allow Ashley Hemmings to extend his stay at Plainmoor.  With the loan window about to close, leading striker Elliot Benyon appeared to be on the verge of leaving Torquay, with Swindon, Dagenham & Redbridge and Southend among the clubs reported to have been interested in making a move for the young forward.  However, Gulls fans were relieved when the window closed with Benyon still part of the United squad - at least until the January transfer window.  Of the two players placed on the transfer list in October, Kieran Charnock moved on loan to Morecambe, with a view to making the deal a permanent one in January. However, former captain Nicky Wroe now seemed happy to remain at Plainmoor after Paul Buckle revealed the midfielder had rejected a move to Aldershot.", "Another year, another transfer window and another FA Cup run for Torquay United.  Despite being the favourite with many bookmakers to take over at Bristol Rovers, Paul Buckle was left to focus on his job at Plainmoor after Dave Penney was installed as the new manager at the Memorial Stadium.  As is often the case, most of the transfer activity was left until the last day of January, although two predictable changes did take place early in the month with Kieran Charnock making his loan move to Morecambe a permanent one and Martin Gritton returning to parent club Chesterfield after the striker had failed to make an impression during his second spell at the club.  Meanwhile, Joe Oastler had his loan from QPR extended until the end of the season.", "The first new face at Plainmoor was Shaun Taylor, who was appointed as Ling's assistant manager.  Taylor was previously the youth coach at Exeter City and was also brother to former Torquay defender Craig Taylor.  With Taylor on board, Ling now looked to bring new players to Torquay.  Firstly, Joe Oastler signed a permanent two-year deal with Torquay after being released by QPR, while Danny Stevens also agreed in principle to renew his contract.  Another familiar face who returned to Torquay was Chris McPhee.  He had played for the Gulls during their disastrous 2006\u201307 season and was looking to make amends on his return to the club.  Joining on the same day as McPhee was Daniel Leadbitter, a promising young defender who had just been released by Newcastle United.", "|18 ||  || MF || Joe Oastler || 8 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 8 || 0", "|Joe Oastler", "|Joe Oastler"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Joe Oastler", "| 28 || DF ||  ||align=left| Joe Oastler || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1"]}, {"page": "Joseph James Oastler", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Oastler"]}, {"page": "Joseph Oastler", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joe Oastler"]}, {"page": "Lee Brown (footballer)", "response": ["He spent the first half of the 2009\u201310 season on loan at administration-stricken Salisbury City of the Conference National, along with teammate Joe Oastler.

He, along with several youngsters were given the opportunity to train with the first team in the latter part of the 2008\u201309 season, after impressing in the reserves. The left-back played an important role in QPR's pre-season of 2009\u201310 and was subsequently given his first squad number in light of the lack of full-backs at the club.

Five minutes in, Kee was sent clear with a pass from Kevin Nicholson and went one-one-one with the Stevenage goalkeeper Chris Day but his weak shot was deflected round the goalpost.  In the 55th minute, Zebroski was shown the first yellow card of the match for foul on Roberts.  Three minutes later, Stevenage made the first substitution of the match, with Darren Murphy replacing Byrom.  Soon after, Mousinho was booked for time-wasting before Harrison was brought on by Stevenage as a substitute for Reid who had injured his hamstring.  Charles then saw his low shot saved by Bevan before Zebroski's shot following an error from Roberts hit the side netting.  Jake Robinson's  strike was saved by Day and then Zebroski shot over the Stevenage bar.  Murphy's close-range header went wide of the Torquay United goal before Robinson's shot hit the Stevenage crossbar.  In the 79th minute, Joe Oastler came on to replace Damon Lathrope and was booked a minute later for a foul on Harrison.  Three minutes later, Branston's initial shot from a Stevenage corner was blocked and he struck the rebound over the bar from around .  With seven minutes of regular time remaining, Torquay United made a double-substitution, with Danny Stevens and Lathaniel Rowe-Turner coming on for Robinson and Nicholson.  Stevenage then brought Beardsley on to replace Charles.

Olejnik came with a fine pedigree having played for Falkirk in the Scottish Premier League while Saah had previously played under Ling at Leyton Orient and Cambridge United.  With Chris Zebroski making the decision to follow former manager Paul Buckle to Bristol Rovers, Ling needed to improve his attacking options which led to the signings of strikers Rene Howe and Taiwo Atieno and midfielder Ian Morris. Finally, as back-up to Bobby Olejnik, former Gulls keeper Martin Rice returned to Plainmoor after two seasons with Truro City.", "With the squad now missing Chris Robertson and Billy Bodin, Martin Ling sought to bring in replacements for the departed pair.  First in was former Wales under-21 winger Nathan Craig.  Currently a free agent, Craig had impressed Ling while playing for the reserves and was offered what amounted to an extended trial until the end of the season. Another new face arrived in the shape of defender Angus MacDonald who was brought in on loan from Reading for the rest of the season. The new players had yet to make an appearance before Torquay's run of good form came to a shuddering halt with a surprise 2\u20131 defeat at Plainmoor to struggling Bradford City.  Fans may well have been wondering if they were feeling the delayed effects of the Manager of the Month 'curse' when the Gulls suffered a second successive loss away to Gillingham.  The 2\u20130 defeat at Priestfield ended in bizarre circumstances with the assistant referee flagging for a penalty when Brian Saah had seemingly brought down former Gulls-loanee Gavin Tomlin in the penalty box.  However, referee Jock Waugh (who had originally waved play-on) decided to send off Joe Oastler instead of Saah.  However, following an appeal, the FA rectified the error and the one-match ban was switched from Oastler to Saah.", "|18 ||  || MF || Joe Oastler || 6 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 6 || 1"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["|= || DF ||  || 2 || Joe Oastler || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1", "|2 ||  || DF || Joe Oastler || 9 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 9 || 1"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 York City F.C. season", "response": ["York were knocked out of the FA Cup after a 4\u20133 extra time defeat away to AFC Wimbledon in a first round replay.
