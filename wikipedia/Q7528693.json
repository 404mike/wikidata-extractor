Raised to a military career, he served with distinction at the Battle of Sobraon, and subsequently became a sheepfarmer in New Zealand. He was the son of Capt. Edwin Sandys Dashwood (fourth son of the 4th Baronet) and Emily Hare. His father died of delirium tremens in Paris in 1835, and the younger Edwin was educated at a military school in Germany. He obtained an ensigncy in the 10th (the North Lincolnshire) Regiment of Foot, and went with them to India. There, he showed great gallantry at the Battle of Sobraon, planting the regimental colors in the Sikh trench-line. He shortly after left for England and exchanged into an English regiment. In 1848, Dashwood resigned his commission and emigrated to New Zealand, and bought a farm at Motueka and a sheep station near Blenheim on the Awatere River. In 1850, he and Captain E.M. Mitchell reconnoitered a route from Blenheim to Christchurch along the Waihopai River, which, however, proved unsuitable for sheep driving. Dashwood Pass, which he discovered during this expedition, now bears his name. During his time in New Zealand, Dashwood, like his father and uncle, became an alcoholic, perhaps in part because of the death of his beloved sister Amelia Caroline in 1847. In 1852, he visited England again and on 25 October 1853, married Roberta Henrietta (d. 11 November 1901), daughter of Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet and the couple had four sons:"]}, {"page": "Abercromby baronets", "response": ["*Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet (1784\u20131855)"]}, {"page": "Robert Abercromby", "response": ["*Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet (1784\u20131855), British politician"]}, {"page": "John Forbes-Sempill, 18th Lord Sempill", "response": ["He was the son of William Forbes-Sempill, 17th Lord Sempill, and Frances Emily Abercromby, the daughter of Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet,Reitwiesner and succeeded to the titles on the death of his father in 1905, prior to which he was known by the courtesy title \"Master of Sempill\".

The original castle, built around 1346, was replaced by a vernacular harled house that was later extended. Significant development of the estate began when it was acquired by the family of Lord Banff and they started the work of landscaping and planting trees. It became their main family seat during the 18th century. After the death of William Ogilvy, the eighth and final Lord Banff, the estate passed by marriage to the Abercromby baronets who continued to enhance the property and maintained it as their main residence. Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect, John Smith to design the present house in 1839.", "The Abercromby baronets owned a significant amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century.
