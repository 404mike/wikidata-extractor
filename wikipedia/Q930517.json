Despite being able to select from a group of players which included Lions tourists Jason White, Tom Smith, Scott Murray, Gregor Townsend, Gordon Bulloch, Nathan Hines, Chris Cusiter, Mike Blair, Ross Ford and Simon Taylor - as well as experienced players like Jon Petrie and Stuart Grimes - Williams' team only won 17.65% of their matches. Scotland won just three games - against the Tier 2 nations Japan and Samoa in 2004, and against Italy in the 2005 Six Nations. Additionally, Williams controversially discarded Townsend - a celebrated figure in Scottish rugby, then aged only 30 - a week prior to the unveiling of his first national squad, despite an admission that his team lacked experienced centres."]}]}}
