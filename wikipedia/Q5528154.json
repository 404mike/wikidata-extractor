Cardiff attacked their higher-ranked opponents quickly and Robert Earnshaw made several early attempts to pass his opposite fullback, Ian Harte. Crowd trouble flared early on when Harte walked to the sideline to take a throw-in and was narrowly missed by a bottle thrown from the stands. Ten minutes into the game, Leeds suffered an early injury blow when Rio Ferdinand was forced off with ankle ligament damage following a foul by Cardiff striker Gavin Gordon. Ferdinand was replaced by Michael Duberry who joined Jonathan Woodgate in the centre of Leeds' defence. This was the first time the pair had played together since Duberry had testified against Woodgate in court. One match report commented that the pair \"barely acknowledged each other\" during the rest of the game, although the BBC noted that the pair \"played well together\".", "|FW ||20|| Gavin Gordon "]}]}}
