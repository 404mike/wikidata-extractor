His first game in charge was a creditable 1\u20131 draw at home to Kevin Keegan's high flying Fulham Steve McGavin left the club for personal reasons before Sanchez was appointed and the new boss was told he had to make \u00a3200,000 from transfers before the end of the season. His first signing was Canadian defender Mark Rogers, who paid his own air fare to England to pursue his dream of playing professional football. By March Jason Kavanagh and Nicky Mohan had departed for Stoke City whilst Notts County paid \u00a320,000 for Mark Stallard. Striker Sean Devine was brought in on loan from Barnet but there was stunning news to follow when Keith Scott signed for local rivals Reading for \u00a3250,000. Scott departed on the same evening that Wanderers travelled to Bristol Rovers, five points adrift at the bottom of the table and eight points from safety. A brave header from Jason Cousins gave the visitors the lead, one which saw Cousins miss the rest of the season and a Sean Devine shot from the edge of the area in the second half brought an unlikely victory. It proved to be a catalyst as the side lost just 2 of its last 11 league games. The highlight was a 2\u20131 win away at Manchester City, where first half goals from Baird and Devine sealed a magnificent double against the fallen giants. Devine was signed permanently for a club record \u00a3200,000. The penultimate game of the season was at home to promotion chasing Wigan Athletic, who went a goal up in the first half but soon pegged back by some sharper shooting from Devine. Early in the second half Paul Emblen deflected in the winning goal to set up a tense final day away at Lincoln City. The club paid for 30-odd supporters coaches and 2,643 Wanderers made the journey to Sincil Bank. A tense game saw Baird miss a golden early chance and when Michael Forsyth hit the post it looked like it really was mission impossible. However, with just seven minutes of the season remaining Devine crossed for Emblen a header over Vaughan and into the top corner of the net. It was an incredible finale to amazing escape from a relegation that seemed a certainty for much of the season. It brought the new manager much praise, but he was to go on to even greater things.", "There was a blow at the start of the 2000\u201301 season when Sean Devine was ruled out with a serious knee injury, one that would keep him out for the whole of the campaign. There was an encouraging start to the league, with a 2\u20131 win away at Millwall, a 3\u20131 win over local rivals Oxford United at Adams Park and a 3\u20131 win against league leaders Walsall Andy Rammell score a brace in the win, who the Wanderers had just signed from the Saddlers for \u00a375,000. There was more bad news with injuries to Paul Emblen, Andy Baird and Jermaine McSporran and Sanchez, short of strikers, had to rely on the loan market, bringing in Steve Jones, Sam Parkin and triallist Niall Thompson.", "Sanchez decided that the poor results were a consequence of an aging team and began major surgery on the squad. Paul Emblen, Dave Carroll, Jason Cousins, Stewart Castledine and Andy Baird were all released and replaced by Richard Harris, Andy Thomson, Frank Talia and Craig Faulconbridge. In August Chairman Ivor Beeks decided to offer the manager a lucrative new three-year contract, partly designed to ward off suitors. The 2002\u201303 season was one of struggle, winning just two of the opening ten league games. Chief Executive Simon Monkman resigned in September and it was later revealed by Chairman Ivor Beeks that the club \"would have been bust by Christmas\" and revealed over spending to the tune of \u00a3100,000 during the first quarter of the season. As the season stumbled into the winter months the manager endured a strained relationship with supporters, with a number of verbal battles conducted through local media. Sanchez incurred more wrath when he sold Sean Devine to Exeter City for \u00a350,000 and during an away game at Cheltenham Town, banners demanded the removal of the manager were displayed. One defeat in eight matches just after Christmas brought the boss time but a dreadful 4\u20130 defeat by Chesterfield at Saltergate saw the under pressure gaffer bring his players over to the away fans and a heated debate ensued. Two further four goal defeats followed and the side failed to win any of its last eight games, escaping relegation by just four points, finishing 18th."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Sean Devine"]}, {"page": "1998 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Colchester United faced Barnet in their play-off semi-final and the first match of the two-legged tie was held at Underhill in Chipping Barnet on 11 May 1998.
