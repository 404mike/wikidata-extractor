She was one of the primary women in the fight for women's right to control and make decisions regarding their sexual choices. Active mainly in Britain, her principal focus was on sexual law reform, including the right for women to both access knowledge on and use birth control, as well as the right to abortion. She was also involved in labour parties, communist parties, as well as a number of women's societies.\nStella Browne was one of the first women to speak out in somewhat offensive ways about her beliefs with a \"Forward, Charge!\" approach. She did this through attacks in her articles and letters that kept her in the public's eye and added to the debates around many controversial topics surrounding women's rights. She is famous for her lectures and her work with the Abortion Law Reform Association. As a women's rights activist, Browne was able to keep questions of women's rights to their body and sexuality in the public eye long enough to get other people interested enough to keep the cause going even after her death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1875\u20131939||data-sort-value=\"Browne, Stella\"|Stella Browne||Canada||1880||1955||Socialist feminist||"]}, {"page": "Abortion Rights (organisation)", "response": ["The \"Abortion Law Reform Association\" was founded in the United Kingdom in 1936 by Janet Chance, Alice Jenkins, Joan MallesonStephen Brooke, \u2018Jenkins , Alice Brook (1886\u20131967)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, May 2006; online edn, May 2008 accessed 24 Oct 2017 and Stella Browne.

The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors, offered women's birth-control advice and taught them the use of a cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926. Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, played a major role in breaking down taboos about sex.
