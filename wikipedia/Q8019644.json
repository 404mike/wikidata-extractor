Jeffery reads the Secret Mark story as an extended double entendre that tells \"a tale of 'sexual preference' that could only have been told by a twentieth-century Western author\" who inhabited \"a homoerotic subculture in English universities\". Jeffery's thesis has been contested by, for example, Scott G. Brown and William V. Harris. Jeffery's two main arguments, those concerning liturgy and homoeroticism, are according to Harris unproductive and he writes that Jeffery \"confuses the question of the authenticity of the text and the validity of Smith's interpretations\" by attacking Smith and his interpretation and not Secret Mark. The homoerotic argument, according to which Smith would have written the document to portray Jesus as practicing homosexuality, does not work either. In his two books on Secret Mark, Smith \"gives barely six lines to the subject\". Jeffery's conclusion that the document is a forgery \"because no young Judaean man\" would approach \"an older man for sex\" is according to Harris also invalid, since there is \"no such statement\" in Secret Mark."]}, {"page": "William Harris", "response": ["*William V.
