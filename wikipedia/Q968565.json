Martian speech is described as sounding \"like a bullfrog fighting a cat\". Accordingly, grok is generally pronounced as a guttural gr terminated by a sharp k with very little or no vowel sound (a narrow IPA transcription might be ). William Tenn suggests Heinlein in creating the word might have been influenced by Tenn's very similar concept of griggo, earlier introduced in Tenn's story \"Venus and the Seven Sexes\" (published in 1949). In his later afterword to the story, Tenn says Heinlein considered such influence \"very possible\"."]}, {"page": "May 9", "response": ["*1920 \u2013 William Tenn, English-American author and academic (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "Poul Anderson", "response": ["* Poul Anderson, an essay by William Tenn"]}, {"page": "List of Worldcons", "response": ["| Terry Pratchett (pro)William Tenn (pro)Jack Speer (fan)Peter Weston (fan)"]}, {"page": "Sturgeon's law", "response": ["According to Philip Klass (William Tenn), Sturgeon made this remark circa 1951, at a talk at New York University attended by Tenn.
