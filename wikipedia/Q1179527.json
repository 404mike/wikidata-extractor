As a result, Stoke left the Football League and thus many of their players departed the club. However Baddeley stayed at the Victoria Ground, and featured 32 times in the Birmingham & District League in 1908\u201309. He scored twice in 48 appearances in 1909\u201310, helping Stoke to top the Southern Football League Division Two A.

He scored twice in 20 games in 1911\u201312, as Stoke concentrated on the Southern League Division One. He featured 31 times in 1912\u201313, as the club were relegated in last place. He then played eight times in 1913\u201314 and twice in 1914\u201315, as Stoke won promotion as champions of Division Two. After leaving Stoke in 1915 he went on to join Kidsgrove Wellington.
