Somerset made a disastrous start to the Championship, losing four of their first six games of the season. Despite a victory in the seventh game against Yorkshire at Scarborough, Somerset's prospects of survival looked very poor indeed at the halfway mark of the season. A strong draw against Surrey was followed by victories against Warwickshire and Lancashire, and although Somerset lost their penultimate game against Surrey, their fate was still in their own hands. Somerset needed to beat Middlesex in the final match of the year at Taunton with one more bonus point than their opponents to assure safety. Thanks to a 9-wicket match haul from Jack Leach on a turning pitch, and a century from James Hildreth in the second innings, Somerset comfortably beat Middlesex by 231 runs to condemn last year's champions to relegation, and ensure their 10-year run in Division One would continue for another season. Leach finished with 51 wickets, while Craig Overton's 46 wickets were enough to see him called up for that winter's Ashes tour. As a mark of how the batting unit struggled, overseas player Dean Elgar was the only batsman to average over 36 with the bat, and Elgar was absent from the second half of the season. New signing Steven Davies was the leading run scorer with 775. Somerset again enjoyed good success in the One-Day Cup, winning five of seven completed matches and qualifying second in the South Group for a home quarter-final against Nottinghamshire. Somerset lost an incredible game in which 834 runs were scored, falling short of Nottinghamshire's 429/9 by 24 runs. Elgar also enjoyed great success in this competition, scoring 519 runs in the 6 games he played. Somerset were again involved in a thriller in the final round of games of the t20 Blast, where a 98-run victory against Hampshire saw them through to the quarter-finals by 0.07 on Net run rate for the first time since 2013. Somerset faced a difficult trip to Trent Bridge, and lost to Nottinghamshire by 5 wickets. At the end of the year it was announced that both one-day captain Jim Allenby and Director of Cricket Matthew Maynard would not be returning for 2018.", "|style=\"text-align:center\"|11|| Steven Davies*\u00a0 ||  ||  || Left-handed || \u2014 ||"]}, {"page": "List of LGBT sportspeople", "response": ["| Steven Davies"]}, {"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Despite little help from the rest of the batting line-up, Ben Smith with 58 and Steven Davies and 43 gave Worcestershire Royals a total of 200, after Nottinghamshire Outlaws' Ryan Sidebottom had bowled four maiden overs and limited the scoring.
