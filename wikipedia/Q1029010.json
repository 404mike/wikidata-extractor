Chambers then created a simple bassline for the verses When Williams' lyrics were mostly done, Chambers felt it lacked \"an obvious title for the track\", and suggested \"Millennium\" for being \"both strong and topical\", because as Chambers said in a retrospective review, \"There was a lot of talk about the millennium back then, it\u2019s a bit like the 'Brexit' word now\".  Then Chambers asked for a \"football chant\", which only had a melody before Williams came up with \"come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'.\" The whole writing process took about four hours, and Chambers described \"Millennium\" as \"the simplest song Robbie and I have ever written - only two chords.

Guy Chambers found a beat by speeding the sample up.

Nick Ingman arranged the orchestra, which according to Power \"was in the wrong key for 'Millennium', although we did want it to sound like the original sample in the choruses and we did refer to John Barry's original score for that\", and conducted a 26-piece string section, plus harp and four French horns, at Angel Recording Studios in Islington to the programmed backing track, with a guide vocal over the top.", "Category:Song recordings produced by Guy Chambers", "Category:Songs written by Guy Chambers"]}, {"page": "Kids (Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue song)", "response": ["\"Kids\" is a duet by singers Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue, released as the second single from Sing When You're Winning, Williams' third studio album, and the third single from Light Years, Minogue's seventh studio album.

The lyrics, although penned by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers, make numerous references to the careers of both Minogue and Williams.
