Forster and Walter de la Mare.  In 1916, they invited conscientious objectors, including Clive Bell and other members of the Bloomsbury Group, to come and work on the home farm for the duration of World War I, as civilian work classified as being of national importance was recognised as an alternative to military service. Aldous Huxley spent some time at Garsington before he wrote Crome Yellow, a book which contains a caricature based on Ottoline for which she never forgave him. His pen portrait of her, written after their first meeting in 1915, summarises the aspects of her character which both attracted and repelled; \"[She] is quite an incredible creature - arty beyond the dreams of avarice and a patroness of literature and the modern. She is intelligent, but her affectation is overwhelming\". Huxley was not the only one of Ottoline's friends to mock her in print. Her affair with a stonemason Lionel Gomme, known as \"Tiger\", who worked on the statuary at Garsington, has been cited by some critics as the basis for Lawrence's portrayal of Lady Chatterley's affair with the gamekeeper, Mellor in his novel of 1928. Lawrence portrayed her even more directly as Lady Hermione Roddice, in his novel Women in Love. The savagery of the depiction caused a decades-long breach in their friendship, and Philip Morrell threatened to sue Lawrence\u2019s publishers."]}, {"page": "Garsington", "response": ["The village hall was built in 1911 and given to the village by the lord of the manor, Philip Morrell.

His arrest and harsh treatment during four months of imprisonment garnered support from prominent people in Britain, including Chappelow's connections within the literary community. A campaign for his release was supported by Bertrand Russell, W. B. Yeats, and George Bernard Shaw. His arrest and the treatment were highlighted in the House of Commons by the Liberal MP Philip Morrell.", "Chappelow's case quickly became well-known. Chappelow himself wrote to lawyer Charles P. Sanger, a friend of the pacifist Bertrand Russell, giving \"a horrifying description of the physical and psychological abuse to which he was subjected\". Russell \"took up his case with various influential people\", including the scholar Gilbert Murray, who agreed to help. The poet W. B. Yeats also supported the cause, with Russell and Yeats writing to ask the playwright George Bernard Shaw to seek support for Chappelow within the government. Shaw \"vainly pressed the case with a Labour member of the Cabinet, Arthur Henderson\", but Henderson \"declined to take any action\". On 27 May 1916, Shaw published an article in a sympathetic magazine, Nation, whose publisher was Shaw's friend Henry William Massingham, \"using Chappelow as symbol of the futility of resistance and the equal futility of compliance\". Russell noted that conscientious objectors, \"including Chappelow have always held that there was no objection to national service, provided it was not directly concerned with the war\". British Liberal politician Philip Morrell addressed the matter in the House of Commons, where he \"argued that Chappelow was being subjected to mental torture\".", "While in Wandsworth, Chappelow met with another noted conscientious objector, George Frederick Dutch, who was equally ill-treated. As Chappelow withered in despondency, Russell sought further intervention from Shaw in Chappelow's case, but at this point, \"Shaw replied sternly. 'Chappelow should either serve or go through with martyrdom. Martyrdom is a matter for the individual soul... you can't advise a man'\". Chappelow spent four months in prison, and was paroled by September 1916, thereafter serving in a Friends' Ambulance Unit on a farm provided by Philip Morrell and Morrell's wife, Ottoline, as a sort of sanctuary for conscientious objectors. When Russell was himself later sentenced to six months in Brixton prison for his anti-war activities, he noted that he found Chappelow \"unduly sentimental\", and remarked in a July 1918 letter to Ottoline Morrell that he hoped not to be like Chappelow in that regard while imprisoned."]}]}}
