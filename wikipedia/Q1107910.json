Silvester (1901 \u2013 1966) was a British organist and composer. Silvester studied organ with C. Spencer Heap in England and, after moving in 1921 to Canada, with Lynnwood Farnam in Saskatoon. During his eight years there, he was organist at the First Baptist Church and Knox United Church. He moved to Toronto in 1929, studied at the TCM with MacMillan (organ) and Willan (theory and composition), and was organist 1931-1938 at the Church of the Messiah and 1938-1966 at Bloor Street United Church, where he led the choir in many large works. At the TCM he served at first, 1929\u20131946, as registrar of examinations, and then, 1946\u20131966, as registrar. He gave organ recitals in many parts of Canada and on the CBC and was president 1945-1947 of the CCO. He was also assistant conductor and coach 1942-1957, and conductor 1957-1960, of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. Of his work with the choir, George Kidd wrote, 'The overall effect is one of good discipline, a clear understanding, and a sincerity that spreads itself over all sections'.Silvester wrote a number of short choral works (published by Harris) and songs (published by Western). His chorale Prelude on Rockingham has been recorded by Eric Robertson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glenn Gould", "response": ["At the age of 10, he began attending the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto (known until 1947 as the Toronto Conservatory of Music). He studied music theory with Leo Smith, the organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back as a result of a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is almost certainly related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould's mother would urge the young Gould to sit up straight at the keyboard. He used this famous chair for the rest of his life and took it with him almost everywhere. The chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low at the keyboard, and allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of his teacher at the Conservatory, Alberto Guerrero."]}, {"page": "The Carlu", "response": ["The newly opened Auditorium was used for radio broadcasts on CKGW during holidays and special events. During Christmastime, one could hear the Cassavant organ being played by Frederick C. Silvester or a May Day organ recital by Harold Frost. It also played motion pictures accompanied by organ music (again broadcast over CKGW), for example showing Snow White in April 1931 with organ music by Kathleen Stokes."]}]}}
