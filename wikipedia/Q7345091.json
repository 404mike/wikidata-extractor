The rainforest was much larger than Stanley expected, leading much of the party to face starvation and disease. The expedition had to resort to looting native villages for food, escalating the conflict between the two groups. Parke, for his part, saved the lives of many in the party, including Stanley, who suffered from acute abdominal pain and a bout of sepsis. Stanley described Parke's care as \"ever striving, patient, cheerful and gentle\u2026most assiduous in his application to my needs, and gentle as a woman in his ministrations\". Parke also treated Arthur Jephson for fever, and nursed Robert H. Nelson through starvation. Furthermore, after a conflict with the natives, Parke had to save William Grant Stairs by orally sucking the poison out of an arrow wound."]}, {"page": "Royal Scottish Geographical Society", "response": ["* Robert H.

Train", "response": ["Train collected printed books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, artifacts, and artwork on African exploration, big-game hunting, natural history, and wildlife conservation, dating primarily from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In 2004, the Russell E. Train Africana Collection was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, where it is housed in the Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Library of Natural History in Washington, D.C. The collection includes correspondence, drafts of publications, diaries, account books, ephemera, posters, news-clippings, biographies, memoirs, portraits, and the former personal property of selected explorers, big game hunters, missionaries, pioneers, and naturalists in Africa. The Train Collection is particularly strong in archival materials on the following topics: the search for the source of the Nile and the progress of other exploring expeditions in Africa; the collecting of specimens of African animals, plants, and ethnological materials for zoos and museums (including a significant body of correspondence and photographs from the Smithsonian African Expedition in 1909-1910, led by President Theodore Roosevelt); and the growth of the African wildlife conservation movement. Besides Roosevelt, the major persons represented in the Train Africana Collection include the journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley and members of his Emin Pasha Relief Expedition (Thomas Heazle Parke, Robert H. Nelson, James S. Jameson, John Rose Troup, William Bonny, William Grant Stairs, Edmund Musgrave Barttelot, and Arthur J. M. Jephson); the medical missionary Dr. David Livingstone and his father-in-law Robert Moffat; taxidermist Carl Akeley; zoologist Edmund Heller; hunter Frederick Selous; artist and adventure writer A.
