E.W MacBride said \"Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist. p. 65.  To put it simply, Huxley preferred to teach what he had actually seen with his own eyes."]}, {"page": "Beverley Nichols", "response": ["Nichols was at school at Marlborough College before proceeding to Balliol College, Oxford in January 1917. His education was interrupted by military service with the Intelligence section at the War Office, as an instructor to the Officer Cadet Battalion in Cambridge, and as aide-de-camp to Arthur Shipley on the British University Mission to the United States. Nichols then returned to Oxford, where he was President of the Oxford Union and editor of Isis. He was homosexual and is thought to have had a brief affair with the war poet Siegfried Sassoon.
