The [fleet] exercises had a greater sense of realism, reflecting the latest thinking on weapons and strategy.\" In 1909, he published a translation of Commander Vladimir Semenoff's Rasplata (The Reckoning), a memoir of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u201305, and witnessed the first crossing of the English Channel by air by Louis Bl\u00e9riot.Kerr, pp. 230\u2013231 He was appointed as commander of the newly constituted Third and Fourth Divisions of the Home Fleet two years later. The years immediately preceding this appointment were marred by disagreements between Admirals Sir John Fisher and Lord Charles Beresford over the direction of the navy and the imposition of reforms. Louis largely supported Fisher's modernising efforts, although he disapproved of his methods, and as a result Fisher's opponents attempted to prevent Louis's promotions.Hough, pp. 237\u2013239", "On the eve of the World War, Churchill and Battenberg made the crucial decision to cancel the scheduled dispersal of the British fleet following practice manoeuvres, to preserve the Royal Navy's battle readiness.Kerr, p. 243 In the view of Andrew Lambert, \"While Churchill planned to recall Fisher if war broke out, he missed the chance to prevent war that might have been provided by drafting him earlier.

Published in 1882 as The Naval War of 1812, the book took James to task for what Roosevelt perceived as glaring mistakes and outright misrepresentations of fact based on malicious anti-American bias and shabby research, despite James's painstaking research and primary sources. In places, Roosevelt becomes almost mocking in his criticism of James. The books conclusions have been disputed by Professor Andrew Lambert in his 2012 book The Challenge: Britain Against America in the Naval War of 1812. Scholars further note that Roosevelt's effort did not actually refer to James's two books on the War of 1812. Instead, Roosevelt referred to James's Naval History series, which holds only a shortened version. This avoidance of James's arguments and detailed evidence of 1817 and 1818 is seen by some as largely undermining Roosevelt's critique of James's work. Moreover, Roosevelt is also accused of ignoring the earlier American claims that provoked James\u2019 errors in the first place, claims that might be best understood to be beneficial to American morale at the time.Lambert (2004), p. v James's primary conclusion \u2013 that no American vessel of equal force ever captured a British ship \u2013 essentially remains unchallenged.Lambert (2004), p.
