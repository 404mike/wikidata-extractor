He was one of Anthony Caro's best-known students, even though the two artists were near contemporaries. Their education followed similar trajectories and they both worked as assistants to Henry Moore. Following the \"New Generation\" show at the Whitechapel Gallery, both Caro and King were included in the seminal 1966 exhibit, \"Primary Structures\" at the Jewish Museum in New York representing the British influence on the \"New Art\". In 2011, his work was represented in the Royal Academy exhibition on Modern British Sculpture which explored British sculpture of the twentieth century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 1", "response": ["*  1934   \u2013 Phillip King, Tunisian-English sculptor"]}, {"page": "Tunis", "response": ["* Phillip King (1934\u20132021), British sculptor"]}, {"page": "Timeline of art", "response": ["*2021 in art -  Death of Jan de Bie, Kim Tschang-yeul, Arik Brauer, Barry Le Va, Forrest Moses, Cindy Nemser, Bill Hammond, Luis Feito, James Bishop, Arturo Di Modica, Alan Bowness, Toko Shinoda, Barbara Ess, Duggie Fields, Elsa Peretti, Jean-Michel Sanejouand, Gianluigi Colalucci, Jean Dupuy, Mary Beth Edelson, Hans Rasmus Astrup, William T.
