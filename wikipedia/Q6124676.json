The management team of George Curtis and John Sillett offered Houchen \u00a3350 a week, \u00a350 an appearance, a \u00a310,000 signing-on fee, as well the chance to play First Division football. He struggled with injuries at the start of the 1986\u201387 campaign, but recovered to ensure his name went down in the club's history for his exploits in the FA Cup. He bagged five goals in their 1986\u201387 cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at Old Trafford against Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. He then scored two against Sheffield Wednesday in the quarter-finals, and one against Leeds United in the semi-finals, both games being held at Hillsborough. The final and most famous goal of the run came in the 1987 FA Cup Final in front of 98,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium in a 3\u20132 win over Tottenham Hotspur. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching food poisoning from a trout caught by reserve goalkeeper Jake Findlay. The goal came from a Dave Bennett cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header that was impossible for Ray Clemence to save. It levelled the score at 2\u20132 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from Gary Mabbutt in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the BBC Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award for the 1986\u201387 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball. It is generally considered as one of the most famous goals scored at Wembley, and certainly the best headed goal."]}, {"page": "Findlay (surname)", "response": ["*Jake Findlay (born 1954), Scottish former footballer"]}, {"page": "1987 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| || || Jake Findlay"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*  Jake Findlay, Goalkeeper, 21 "]}]}}
