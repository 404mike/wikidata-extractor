Wood, Ian 2009, op.cit It has been suggested that this account formed the basis of the Passio Albani, the foundational text of all information about Saint Alban:  while this is fundamentally unprovable the evidence is strong that the Passio originated within the circle of Germanus at Auxerre.  Germanus then deposited some of the bones of continental saints in the basilica, and took a sample of the earth at the site of Alban's martyrdom, which still bore the marks of the martyr's blood. Some have advanced arguments for the antiquity of the cult of Saint Alban (for example Martin Biddle), while others suggest it was a rather artificial creation from the final years of Roman Britain, or soon after.

This Middle Saxon settlement was known as Lundenwic. Lundenwic was subjected to increasing Viking attack in the 9th century and the population may have been forced to scatter. Around the year 886, Alfred the Great moved the Londoners back into the City of London and the shelter of the Roman defensive walls, which still stood.
