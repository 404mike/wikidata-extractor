The Wilkes family, Scarlett's unattainable love interest, may be cousins to the Mitchells since her family line hails from Wilkes County, and they were an actual, prominent secessionist family. The author, Margaret Mitchell, is a relation to the Collier family and to the author of this article. I don't have a source, but I believe a Harris relative made a trip from Atlanta after it was burned in a wagon, as Scarlett does. The book is controversial in its treatment of race. Mitchell was herself a philanthropist in the African-American community and a member of a racially progressive family that would have personally faced significant ethnic discrimination and even violence from the second reincarnation of the Ku Klux Klan based out of her hometown of Atlanta at the time of her book's publication, making most modern interpretations, at best, muddled."]}, {"page": "List of British actors", "response": ["* Lillian Kemble-Cooper (1892\u20131977)"]}, {"page": "Hitchy-Koo", "response": ["Besides Hitchcock, the large cast included Lucille Ager, Maurice Black, Dan Brennan, Chief Eagle Horse, Sylvia Clark, Joe Cook, Lillian Kemble-Cooper, James J.
