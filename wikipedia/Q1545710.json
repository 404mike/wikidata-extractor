He scored his last goal for City in a 6\u20131 victory against Wrexham in the Western Regional League in 1939, the Second World War having disrupted the normal league programme. In over eleven years with Manchester City, Brook scored 177 goals in 494 appearances. He was the all-time highest Manchester City goalscorer until his tally was equalled and then surpassed by Sergio Aguero in 2017. Before a Premier League match between City and Arsenal in November 2017, Aguero was presented with a prize for becoming City's record goalscorer by Mike Summerbee and Brook's daughter, Betty Cowgill. Brook retained the record for most league goals (158) for City (which he held with Tommy Johnson) until 2019. Aguero's hat-trick in a 6-0 victory against Chelsea in February 2019 put him on 160 league goals, surpassing both Brook and Johnson. Brook also held the record of having scored the most goals for England (10) of any Manchester City player. Francis Lee equalled this record when he scored his final goal for England in a 3-1 defeat to West Germany in 1972. Raheem Sterling equalled this record with his first goal and surpassed it with his second goal in a 6-0 defeat of Bulgaria in October 2019 (the two goals put Sterling on 12 goals for England overall, but he had only scored eleven of them when he was a City player). Only five players have appeared for Manchester City more times than Eric Brook: Alan Oakes, Joe Corrigan, Mike Doyle, Bert Trautmann and Colin Bell. Of the 158 league goals Brook scored for City, 145 were scored in the first division. The only left wingers to have scored more goals in the top flight of English football are Cliff Bastin who scored 150 and Grenville Morris who scored 153.

Although results were still disappointing, the standard of the Welsh side was thought to be improving rapidly as margins of defeat became smaller and several defeats to the English and Scottish sides between 1902 and 1905 were deemed unlucky by match reporters based on the run of play. The side also avoided defeat in an away fixture against the Scots in March 1904 after holding their opponents to a 1\u20131 draw. The following year, Wales defeated Scotland for the first time in the team's history when goals from Meredith, Grenville Morris and Walter Watkins secured a 3\u20131 victory, although Wales were unable to capitalise on the victory as they finished second to England in the 1905\u201306 British Home Championship after failing to win either of their remaining fixtures. Having missed the previous two years while serving a ban for his part in the 1905 English football bribery scandal, Meredith returned to play for Wales in the 1906\u201307 British Home Championship. In their first match, Wales defeated Ireland 3\u20132 in Belfast with Meredith scoring his side's second goal before Lot Jones scored the winning goal. Grenville Morris scored the only goal of the match to give Wales their third consecutive victory over Scotland. In Wales' final match, Lot Jones gave his side the lead at Craven Cottage before England equalised in the second half. England went on to draw their final game of the tournament against Scotland, handing Wales their first British Home Championship success. All 21 players used in the tournament were awarded a commemoration medal by the FAW for the achievement."]}]}}
