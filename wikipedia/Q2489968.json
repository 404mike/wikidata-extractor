The financial strain caused by the pandemic led to the club needing to cut costs, initially confirming the departure of assistant manager Jimmy Nicholl and asking the players to take wage cuts of up to 30 per cent in June 2020. After discussions lasting several weeks, 12 of the 13 players asked to take cuts agreed, with striker Kane Hemmings the only one to hold out longer. Despite initially agreeing to the wage cut as well, Hemmings decided to renege and leave the club in August. Later that month, Dundee would make cuts to their Youth Academy coaching staff, though the majority of coaches would continue their roles in a voluntary capacity. The club would also appoint former player and first-team coach Dave Mackay as assistant manager."]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["Dundee secured back-to-back wins with a 1\u20130 home win over bogey side St Johnstone, hopping up to 9th place. Their momentum would be inevitably halted at Ibrox Stadium as they were picked apart by Rangers. They would take the lead over Ross County despite losing Charlie Adam again to injury via a Luke McCowan double, but could not hold it together and would suffer defeat in Dingwall. A valiant defensive performance at Easter Road was undone by a freak own goal that would be enough for a Dundee defeat. Dundee would be very short-staffed in their next match against Hearts due to various injuries piling up, a suspension for Ryan Sweeney and Jason Cummings being dismissed from training due to showing up 'unfit to train'. Despite another even game in misty conditions, a late Hearts goal was enough to seal a fourth straight defeat for the Dee. Dundee's already injury-shortened squad was thrown into more crisis with a COVID-19 outbreak, but the SPFL refused to postpone their Boxing Day game away to Aberdeen, where Dundee were forced to register a goalkeeper and assistant manager Dave Mackay as outfield substitutes. Despite taking the lead early, the tired side were once again just beaten. Their remaining games in December were rearranged due to the SPFL moving the winter break forward at the request of the clubs, including Dundee."]}]}}
