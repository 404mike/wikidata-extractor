He was appointed as Colchester's caretaker manager on 22 September 2008 after the departure of Geraint Williams.

However, he left the club after Paul Lambert took over as manager on 9 October 2008."]}, {"page": "Colchester United F.C.", "response": ["Colchester consolidated their position in the third tier of English football for a number of seasons, before achieving their then-highest league finish of second place only to Essex rivals Southend United in the 2005\u201306 season. Under Phil Parkinson's stewardship, the U's were promoted to the second tier for the first time in their history. However, when Parkinson left to take the reins at Hull City, his assistant Geraint Williams was handed the daunting task of guiding Colchester into their first season in the Championship. He led the side to a 10th position finish, above East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, Norwich City and Essex rivals Southend United, while gaining the Pride of Anglia title in the process for the first time in their history. The momentum however did not continue into their second season in the Championship, as they finished bottom of the league and were relegated back to League One.", "During the club's second season in the Championship, Layer Road hosted its final game on 26 April 2008 as the U's fell to a 1\u20130 defeat to Stoke City. The club then moved to their new ground, the Colchester Community Stadium, in the summer of 2008 in preparation for life back in the third tier. Despite hoping to make an immediate return to the Championship, the club made a dreadful start to the 2008\u201309 campaign, which saw manager Geraint Williams lose his job, leaving the club second from bottom. He was replaced by former Wycombe Wanderers manager Paul Lambert as he guided the club to a mid-table finish."]}, {"page": "Leyton Orient F.C.", "response": ["Leyton Orient kicked off the 2008\u201309 season with a 2\u20131 win over Hereford United at home. Dean Beckwith put Hereford ahead before JJ Melligan and Adam Boyd gave Orient the win. Orient then continued the season with multiple poor results and performances throughout September and October and their only wins were away matches against Walsall and Southend United in the Football League Trophy first round. However Orient were knocked out of the trophy in the following round in an away match at Brighton & Hove Albion. They were in 22nd position in the League One table. Orient booked a place in the second round of the FA Cup after beating Colchester United 1\u20130. Two Goals from Jason Demetriou and Danny Granville in a 1\u20132 away victory against Bradford City put Orient through to the third round of the FA Cup where they played Sheffield United at home. They lost 4\u20131 and, after a run of bad form in the league, Orient parted company with manager Martin Ling and assistant Dean Smith. Youth team manager Kevin Nugent was named caretaker manager overseeing three games. On 5 February 2009 Geraint Williams was announced as manager until the end of the season. He enjoyed a very positive start, winning seven of his first nine matches and moving Orient up to 15th. After Geraint Williams' positive influence on the team they secured their League One status on 13 April with a 1\u20130 win over Swindon Town at the County Ground and eventually finished the season in 14th place.", "On 3 April 2010 Geraint Williams was sacked as manager after a 3\u20131 home defeat to fellow relegation strugglers Hartlepool following a poor run of form. Kevin Nugent once again took control for the 2\u20131 defeat at Southampton on 5 April and after the match Russell Slade was named as manager until the end of the season. With even less time to save Orient from relegation than Williams before him, Slade managed to bring about a change in form that saw Orient finish in 17th place, just one point but four places clear of relegation. In the summer of 2010 Slade's contract was extended for two years. After a poor start to the 2010\u201311 season, Orient's league form picked up towards Christmas, culminating in an 8\u20132 win against non-league Droylsden in an FA Cup second round replay. In a game described as \"the weirdest football match ever\", Orient had trailed most of the game 2\u20130 but scored six goals in extra time to progress into the third round. Orient then beat high-flying Championship side Norwich City 1\u20130 at Carrow Road to progress into the fourth round where they met another Championship side, Swansea City, at the Liberty Stadium. Orient beat Swansea 2\u20131 to set up a glamour fifth round tie against Premier League giants Arsenal at Brisbane Road, which finished in a 1\u20131 draw thanks to a late Jonathan T\u00e9hou\u00e9 equaliser for the O's. This set up a replay at the Emirates Stadium. Leyton Orient lost that replay 0\u20135, bringing to an end their longest run in the FA Cup since 1981\u201382. Either side of the Arsenal games, Leyton Orient achieved a club record-equalling 14\u00a0games unbeaten, putting the team just outside the play-off positions.
