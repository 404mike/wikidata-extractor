In addition East Africa selected two reserves and the Lions one; although substitutions were not allowed it was usual to select reserves at this time in case a player did not arrive on time or was unable to start the match.  The match programme also states that Frank Sykes (Northampton & ), Robin Roe (Lansdowne & ) and Tom Reid (Garryowen & ) had been selected to play this match, but the Lions' archives suggest that ultimately they did not.  It appears that the reserve Bryn Meredith and Billy Williams (who had been assigned as the Lions touch-judge) were called upon to start in place of Roe and R.H. Williams while D.G.S. Baker was required to fill in for Sykes.  East Africa took the field as advertised in the programme."]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Rugby Union County Championship", "response": ["| ||Frank Sykes || Huddersfield"]}, {"page": "1956\u201357 Rugby Union County Championship", "response": ["| ||Frank Sykes || Northampton"]}]}}
