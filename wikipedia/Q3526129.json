Scotton played his first match at Lord's for Sixteen Colts of England against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 11 and 12 May 1874, scoring on that occasion 19 and 0. He was engaged as a groundman by the MCC in that year and in 1875, and after an engagement at Kennington Oval returned to the service of the MCC, of whose ground staff he was a member at the time of his death. His powers were rather slow to ripen, and he had been playing for several years before he obtained anything like a first-rate position. At one period of his career, however, and more particularly during the seasons of 1884 and 1886, he was among the best professional left-handed batsman in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. G.

In that document, it stated that \"If ye Striker touches or takes up ye Ball before she is lain quite still, unless asked by ye Bowler or Wicket Keeper, its out.\" Similar wording remained in the revision made to the laws thirty years later. The first batsman to be dismissed for handling the ball in first-class cricket was James Grundy, who suffered the fate while playing for the MCC against Kent in 1857. Prior to 1899, a batsman could be given out for handling the ball even if they were doing so to remove a ball which had got stuck in their equipment or clothing. At the time, if one of the fielders removed the ball from the batsman's clothing, they could claim a catch.Brodribb (1995), p. 229. It was in such a situation that George Bennett, the first player to be given out handled the ball in English county cricket, was dismissed in 1872. The wicket of William Scotton in early 1887 was described by Gerald Brodribb as \"most unusual\". In a match between the smokers and the non-smokers involved in the 1886\u201387 Ashes series, Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest. Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high-scoring match, he defended the delivery and picked the ball up.

In 1880, the Australians toured England, making considerable money from gate receipts, something English cricketers, regarded as \"gentlemen\" did not do. Nottinghamshire's Alfred Shaw, however, saw this as an opportunity. He arranged a first-class match between the Players of the North and the Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford toward the end of the tour, which made Shrewsbury a healthy profit. A few days after this match, he hastily arranged a match between Nottinghamshire and the Australians at Trent Bridge. Seeking once more to make money, Shaw informed Holden that himself and six other Nottinghamshire players would only take to the field for a minimum of \u00a320 each. Holden agreed, albeit reluctantly, and was reported to privately fuming at the demand. In the Autumn, Shaw attempted to arrange an early season fixture for the following season against Yorkshire, with the view of once again profiting from it. Holden found out about this and told Shaw he alone did not have the authority to arrange county fixtures. He proceeded to write to all of Nottinghamshire's professionals, informing them they would have to sign a binding contract under which they would have to be available for all official Nottinghamshire matches.
