He was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire and died at Dover, Kent.\nAs a cricketer, Kirwan played in six Cambridge matches as a batsman; there is no record that he bowled. He was not notably successful in any of his first-class matches and his highest score in nine innings was just 15; he was not selected for the University Match against Oxford University in any of his Cambridge seasons. Kirwan's younger brother, John, was very much more successful in his cricket career and played alongside him in a few Cambridge games from 1836. In the first of the matches in which both Kirwans appeared, John Kirwan took 15 wickets against Cambridge Town Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kirwan", "response": ["* Edward Kirwan (1814\u20131890), English clergyman and cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Edward Kirwan", "|Made 18 first-class appearances, 14 of which were for Cambridge University.
