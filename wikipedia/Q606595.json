Overland's nearly 30-year career began in his home region of East Anglia, where he and his brother Chris formed the band Wildlife in 1980.  The group were scouted by Adam Faith and soon signed to Chrysalis Records, who released the band's debut album, Burning, in 1980. The band moved labels to the Led Zeppelin owned Swan Song Records for their 1983 self-titled follow up album, which featured Simon Kirke on drums. The band were also managed for a short period by Peter Grant.  The demise of Swan Song in 1983 meant that the Wildlife album was under-promoted, with an American release for the album being cancelled. Around this time, the band also recorded a song called \"Shot in the Dark\" that was never featured on an album.  However, this tune later served as the prototype for Ozzy Osbourne's song of the same name. Wildlife's version was never officially released, and the band split up soon after.\nOverland next formed the AOR band FM, with former Wildlife members Pete Jupp and Chris Overland. FM's first album, issued in 1986 on Portrait Records, was named Indiscreet. The band's next album, Tough It Out, was released in 1989 with serious financial backing from Epic Records, which was Portrait's parent company. For this album, the band brought in songwriter Desmond Child, known for his work on Bon Jovi's album, Slippery When Wet. This 1986 to 1989 period saw the band at their commercial peak, scoring minor UK Chart hits with \"Frozen Heart\", \"Bad Luck\", and the non-album release, \"Let Love Be The Leader\". The band toured as headline artists, as well as undertaking support slots with Bon Jovi, Tina Turner and Meat Loaf.The band was then dropped by Epic Records and signed to Music for Nations for their third album, Takin' It to the Streets. The album displayed a shift towards a more straightforward rock approach and also included a cover of \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\", which was released as a single.  This was the first album to feature ex-Visage and ASAP guitarist Andy Barnett, Chris Overland having left the band after the Tough It Out tour. FM's fourth album, Aphrodisiac, followed in 1992 and is often considered to be the band's best. The band then signed to the Raw Power label to record Dead Man's Shoes, which featured new keyboard player, Jem Davis.  In March 1996, Steve Overland and Pete Jupp decided to disband FM, forming the band So! with Wishbone Ash bass player, Bob Skeat, soon after. So!'s debut album, Brass Monkey, had two very limited releases, with copies of either release being difficult to come by.\nOverland has recorded prolifically throughout the 2000s (decade), with the bands The Ladder, Shadowman, and latterly, with his solo albums, Break Away and Diamond Dealer.In 2007, FM reformed for a one-off gig at Nottingham's Rock City, headlining Firefest IV. This 'one-off' reunion led to a more permanent incarnation with Jim Kirkpatrick replacing Andy Barnett on lead guitar. Overland and Kirkpatrick had been a songwriting team independently of the band prior to Jim joining FM. FM have since toured extensively in the UK and throughout Europe, both as headliners and also touring with Thin Lizzy, Journey, Foreigner and Europe. Five more albums have been released Metropolis (2010), Rockville (2013), Rockville II (2013), Heroes and Villains (2015) and Atomic Generation (2018).\nOverland has also appeared in the Broadway show Dreamtime, which had a successful run at the Ed Sullivan Theater.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Overland", "response": ["* Steve Overland, British singer and musician"]}, {"page": "On Air (Alan Parsons album)", "response": ["* Steve Overland \u2013 lead vocals (track 7)"]}, {"page": "FM (British band)", "response": ["At Nottingham's Rock City venue on 27 October 2007 however, FM played together again in public for the first time in twelve years, headlining the sold-out Firefest festival. The reaction the band received to this one-off appearance led to the swift decision to make the reunion permanent.  Guitarist Andy Barnett could not commit to long-term plans however and the band were disappointed to accept his resignation.  At Steve Overland's suggestion Jim Kirkpatrick was recruited and he made his live debut with FM at a low-key show at Winstanley College (Wigan, UK) on 19 March 2009, followed by a more public appearance when FM headlined Firefest for a second time on October 2009.

Wildlife recorded a demo version of the song that was never officially released. When Soussan joined Ozzy Osbourne's band a couple of years later, he and Osbourne then reworked the song for Ozzy Osbourne's recording and release in early 1986. As a result, there has been much debate over the proper authorship of the song.  Although the writing is credited to Soussan and Osbourne, some question whether other members of Wildlife (the Overland brothers, in particular) deserve writing credit for Osbourne's rendition, and what Osbourne's exact role was in the rewriting process.Interview with FM Vocalist, Steve Overland, Retrieved 3 December 2015"]}, {"page": "Archiva 2", "response": ["\"Moon Under the Water\" was written by Downes and Johnny Warman in March 1988 and was one of the tracks recorded by the duo in the basement of Advision Studios in London from 1988 to 1989.
