In 1945 he played for the regimental football team in a friendly against Gillingham, and his skills as an outside right caught the eye of Gillingham manager Archie Clark, who persuaded him to sign for the club as a professional later that year. He made 9 appearances and scored 8 goals as the club won the Kent League championship in the 1945\u201346 season. He was a semi-regular player in the Gills' team after the club re-joined the Southern Football League in 1946, making around 20 appearances each season over the following four seasons, and helping the club win the championship on two occasions. After the club gained re-election to the Football League at the end of the 1949\u201350 season, he found opportunities limited and only played nine times at the higher level over the course of three seasons. He scored his only Football League goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Bournemouth in April 1953. Although he did not play for the first team again after the 1953\u201354 season, he remained with the club until 1958, and was rewarded for his long service  with a benefit match, jointly with Vic Niblett, against a British Army team in that year.  After his retirement from professional football, he continued to play in local amateur leagues well into his fifties, while working in the gas industry. He died in Rochester in 1992, shortly before his 71st birthday."]}, {"page": "Niblett", "response": ["* Vic Niblett (1924\u20132004), English footballer"]}]}}
