The leader, Geoff Duke, decided to refuel on lap 3. Ray Amm in second place went straight through without stopping and lapped in 25\u00a0minutes and 28 seconds at an average speed of 88.93\u00a0mph and now led Geoff Duke by 32 seconds. At the Windy Corner on lap 4, the visibility was down to 20\u00a0yards and a decision was made to stop the race because of the conditions. This allowed Ray Amm, due to refueling at the TT Grandstand on lap 4, to win the 1954 Senior TT Race in 1\u00a0hour, 42\u00a0minutes and 46.8 seconds at an average race speed of 88.12\u00a0mph. The controversial decision by race organisers to stop the 1954 Senior TT Race on lap 4, just as the weather started to improve, was protested by the Gilera management. This was on the grounds that the works Norton team were told of the decision allowing Ray Amm to lead the race on lap 3, but the official protest was rejected by the race organisers.Official TT Guide 2005 During lap 1 of the 1954 Senior TT Race, Simon Sandys-Winsch riding a Junior Velocette crashed at the Highlander and died in hospital a few days later."]}, {"page": "1953 Isle of Man TT", "response": ["|| Ted Frend\t  \t "]}, {"page": "1949 Dutch TT", "response": ["|  Ted Frend"]}, {"page": "David Whitworth", "response": ["On 2 July 1950, Whitworth competed in the 350\u00a0cc Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps.
