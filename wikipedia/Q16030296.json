Although she never became a big star, she worked steadily in London's West End and in British provincial theatres from her teen years until after World War I, especially for producer George Edwardes, and had a few roles in America. She sometimes performed with her husband, Lawrence Grossmith, and her brother, Vernon Castle.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vernon and Irene Castle", "response": ["Vernon, the son of a pub owner, was raised in Norwich, England initially training to become a civil engineer.

The pair of them carol and foot it lightly and irresponsibly well throughout the evening, and the fine voice of Miss Kitty Gordon, as the jealous Teresa, linked to her equally fine presence, make an agreeable alternative to their efforts. Mr Walter Hyde must not be forgotten where vocal successes are the question, nor is the comic relief of Mr Walter Passmore nor the artful nonchalances of Mr Willie Warde to be ignored in any play where either appears, any more than Mr Angelo, that doctor of laughter. But I find myself running into a longer list of names than is my usual custom in these impressions of the theatre, longer, perhaps, than the play has such merits, yet the fact remains that the amount of talent engaged by Mr Frank Curzon for this production is considerably greater than usual.", "Miss Kitty Gordon, again, the handsome but jealous character, sang delightfully, and \"Woman's Love\" is bound to become a very popular number. There is very little fun in the lyrics of the new play, and possibly Mr. Charles Angelo scored best of all the men with \"The Wizard of Wimpole Street.\" With a little time, however, some of the numbers will get a better effect, and with the comic scenes elaborated by Mr. Walter Passmore and Mr. Albert Le Fre there will be more laughter to carry the \"business\" through. Last night Mr. Willie Warde got more fun into his little scenes than anyone else. His efforts of a gentle-mannered old man to appear a dashing devil may care conspirator set the house in roars. It was droll, and was done with an ease that is rarely seen in musical comedy. Miss Ethel Irving had little to do, but that little was well done. Miss Caroline Hatchard sang well; so too, did Mr. Walter Hyde. Miss Coralie Blythe was successful.Review of The Three Kisses - Daily Mail 22 August 1907"]}, {"page": "List of interments at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)", "response": ["* Coralie Blythe"]}]}}
