Several Tasmanian features are named after him.Jack Thwaites, 'Emmett, Evelyn Temple (1871\u20131970)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 8, (MUP), 1981", "On the return train trip from Mount Field on the last ski trip of the 1929 season Emmett suggested the idea of forming what would later become The Hobart Walking Club. He was supported by another keen skier and bushwalker, Jack Thwaites.", "Emmett's casual suggestion on the train returning from Mount Field was received with such enthusiasm that shortly afterwards a notice was placed in The Mercury calling for interested persons to attend a meeting at Hobart Town Hall. Forty people, including the skiers from Mount Field, were present on Tuesday, 12 November 1929 when the Hobart Walking Club was formed. Walter Taylor was elected first President, Jack Thwaites, Secretary, and Cecil Johnston, Treasurer. Enthusiasm for the club ran high and nine days later the first general meeting was held. At this meeting rules were adopted and seventeen foundation members paid their subscriptions, nearly half of whom were women.", "Among the foundation members were Emmett and Jack Thwaites, Walter Taylor, Geoffrey Chapman (who later designed the club's badge) and Alfred White. In the weeks ahead membership continued to grow and on Saturday 30 November 1929 the first club walk on Mount Wellington was organized. It was a highly successful outing with thirty-five members, mostly women, walking from Cascades to the Log Cabin (later replaced by the Rock Cabin). Among them were Jack Thwaites and Emmett, who was known variously to club members as 'E.T.', 'Em', or, more respectfully, Mr Emmett. Between them, Emmett and Jack Thwaites laid the foundations for what would become one of Australia's most popular and important walking clubs.", "In December 1930 Emmett joined a party which made the first ascent of Mount Ida on the eastern shore of Lake St Clair. He also named Lake Oenone and Lake Helen on the upper reaches of neighbouring Mount Olympus. In March 1934 he made an early ascent of Frenchmans Cap with Jack Thwaites and Des Giblin, an expedition he describes colourfully in a Walkabout article;", "Lake Sophie, nestled below the mountain's southern face, was named on that trip by Jack Thwaites after Emmett's wife. In the early 1930s plans were put in place to build a vehicular road from The Springs to the summit of Mount Wellington, a proposal which met with considerable opposition. Emmett pushed strongly for the construction of the Pinnacle Road, despite his love of bushwalking and harbouring a lifelong contempt for the motor car. 'Dad's opinion was that not everybody was capable of walking to the pinnacle,' his daughter, Margaret, remembered. 'He believed that the majestic view from the summit should be shared by car owners as well as walkers.'", "*Suggested and founded Hobart Walking Club with Jack Thwaites in 1929.", "*Jack Thwaites", "*Kleinig, Simon, Jack Thwaites \u2013 Pioneer Tasmanian Bushwalker and Conservationist, Forty Degrees South Pty Ltd, Hobart, 2008", "*Jack Thwaites Bush Diaries"]}, {"page": "Hobart Walking Club", "response": ["Hobart Walking Club is a recreational walking club based in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia that was started in 1929 by Jack Thwaites and Evelyn Temple Emmett"]}]}}
