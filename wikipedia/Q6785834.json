On 21 January 2012 he scored an equaliser against Dagenham & Redbridge, dispatching his shot on the half volley for his second goal in as many games, Crewe went on to win 4\u20131. Pearson's loan was extended for another two months with Crewe manager Steve Davis stating \"Our own forwards have not been scoring enough goals, but Greg has shown he can. He gets into the six-yard box and gives us a physical presence up there.\" On 25 February 2012 he put his side 3\u20131 up in the eventual 3\u20133 draw at home to AFC Wimbledon after some splendid forward play from Pearson. He held off the intentions of former defender Mat Mitchel-King before turning and volleying past Brown after a cross from Luke Murphy had taken a deflection and looped into the air."]}, {"page": "Ollie Turton", "response": ["Turton began his professional career with Crewe Alexandra in 2010.
