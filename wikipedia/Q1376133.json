He did not initially intend to take Sankey as his musical associate, preferring the services of the more experienced gospel singers Philip Phillips or Philip Bliss. Neither was available, so Sankey was taken. The tour got off to a slow start; barely 50 people attended the first rally, held in York,Everett, p. 38 and this congregation was unused to the kind of gospel songs \u2013 \"human hymns\" \u2013 that Sankey introduced. (This feature, by Mel R. Wilhoit,  first appeared in Rejoice magazine, published by the University of Mississippi, USA) Gradually, however, the British public was won over, halls were filled, and Sankey's \"singing the gospel\" became a popular feature of the services.  To familiarise the congregations  with the words of new hymns by Bliss, Fanny Crosby and others, Sankey published a short collection of the favorite numbers, under the title Sacred Songs and Solos. The collection was much expanded in later editions, eventually comprising 1,200 pieces. While in Scotland, Sankey composed his first gospel song, a setting of Horatius Bonar's hymn \"Yet There is Room\".Sankey 1906, p. 24  The tour extended over two years, with meetings in most of the main British cities. When it reached London, congregations included many of the most prominent in the land, including Queen Victoria, the Princess of Wales, and the statesman William Ewart Gladstone.Sankey 1906, pp. 25\u201326", "Sankey began to compose hymn tunes during the first Moody-Sankey tour of Britain in 1873\u20131875.

The \"1200\" version of Sacred Songs and Solos includes nearly 200 of Sankey's settings of hymns by writers such as Horatius Bonar, Fanny Crosby, Elizabeth C.
