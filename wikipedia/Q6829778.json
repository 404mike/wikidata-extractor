He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Derbyshire in 1999.\nDespite signing a contract in the 1999 season, after a successful run in the 1998 Second XI, and despite being amongst Dominic Cork's preferred non-signings for the Derbyshire team, he failed to appear often within the starting lineup of the first team, though his occasional swing bowling was enough to put even the most experienced of batsmen off, catching players like Anthony McGrath and Richard Blakey off guard.\nDeane had been playing in the Second XI since 1994, where he debuted against a Durham team who drew their game after forfeiting their second innings. He appeared regularly in the Second XI Championship in 1998 and 1999, but only made two County Championship appearances, as a tailend batsman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Deane", "response": ["Michael Deane may refer to:", "* Michael Deane (chef) (born 1961), chef from Northern Ireland", "* Michael Deane (journalist) (1951\u20132013), British journalist and cameraman", "* Michael Deane (cricketer) (born 1977), English cricketer"]}]}}
