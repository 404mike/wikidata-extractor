Austin Freeman (1862\u20131943). Thorndyke was described by his author as a 'medical jurispractitioner': originally a medical doctor, he turned to the bar and became one of the first \u2014 in modern parlance \u2014 forensic scientists. His solutions were based on his method of collecting all possible data (including dust and pond weed) and making inferences from them before looking at any of the protagonists and motives in the crimes. Freeman ensured that his methods were practical by conducting all experiments mentioned in the stories himself.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fingerprint", "response": ["The British detective writer R.

But in nearly every case Dr. Priestly's interest in the problem ceased when he had solved it to his own satisfaction. The fate of the criminal was a matter of complete unconcern to him. He treated detection much as he would have treated a game of chess. The pieces in the game had no more than a passing interest to him. Not that he was unsympathetic by nature, as many people had good cause to know. But, in the problems which Hanslet set before him, he purposely took a detached and impersonal attitude.

Austin Freeman", "response": ["Dr. Richard Austin Freeman  (11 April 1862 \u2013 28 September 1943) was a British writer of detective stories, mostly featuring the medico-legal forensic investigator Dr. Thorndyke. He invented the inverted detective story (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Roberts said that this invention was Freeman's most noticeable contribution to detective fiction. Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial surgeon in his novels. Many of the Dr. Thorndyke stories involve genuine, but sometimes arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as tropical medicine, metallurgy and toxicology.", "Freeman briefly stopped writing at the outbreak of the Second World War, but then resumed writing in an air-raid shelter he had built in his garden. Freeman was plagued by Parkinson's disease in his later years. This makes his achievement all the more remarkable, as in his declining years he wrote both Mr. Polton Explains, which Bleiler says \"... is in some ways his best novel\", and The Jacob Street Mystery (1942) in which Roberts considers that Thorndyke \"is at his analytical best.\" He was living at 94, Windmill Street, Gravesend, Kent when he died on 28 September 1943. His estate was valued at \u00a36,471\u00a05s\u00a011d. Freeman was buried in the old Gravesend and Milton Cemetery at Gravesend. The Thorndyke File This was a journal devoted to the works of Freeman that was founded in 1976 by Philip Asdell and continued in 1981 by John McAleer. started a funding drive to erect a granite marker for Freeman's grave, and this was erected in September 1979, with the text: Richard Austin Freeman, 18621943, Physician and Author, Erected by the friends of \"Dr. Thorndyke\", 1979.", "Freeman was a significant author of detective fiction in his day. He was most famous for his creation of Dr. Thorndyke, and many of the obituaries recording his death refer to this in the obituary headline. Thus the Birmingham Daily Gazette announced \"Dr. Thorndyke\" Creator Dead, the Belfast News-Letter announced Obituary Dr. R. A. Freeman, Creator of \"Dr. Thorndyke\", and the Evening Star (Dunedin) announced Obituary: Creator of Dr. Thorndyke.", "Inevitably, commentators compared Thorndyke with Holmes. Binyon says that Thorndyke stands out from the other late Victorian and early Edwardian detectives in being a rival to Sherlock Holmes, rather than just owing their existence to his success. \"Thorndyke is the most impressive and the most intellectually powerful of fictional detectives.\" Poupard notes that \"In critical comparisons with Holmes, Dr. Thorndyke is deemed the more accurate thinker and ranked superior as a scientific authority, whereas Holmes is considered the superior literary creation\". One immediate clue to the difference between Thorndyke and Holmes, is that Holmes calls his inductive reasoning deduction, a mistake that Thorndyke would never make. Binyon notes that Holmes often makes factual errors, referring to the blue carbuncle as crystallised charcoal, when it contains no carbon, and referring to non-existent species or martial arts.", "| 6 || 1909 || John Thorndyke's Cases (Dr. Thorndyke's Cases in US) ||  || || 246p., ill., plan, 8vo. || Lon: Chatto & Windus || NY: Dodd, Mead (1931) || ", "| 17 || 1923 || Dr. Thorndyke's Case-Book (The Blue Scarab in the US) ||  || || 317 p., 8\u00ba || NY: Dodd Mead, (1924) || || ", "| 24 || 1927 || A Certain Dr. Thorndyke ||  || || 310 p., 8\u00ba || Lon: Hodder & Stoughton || NY: Dodd, Mead (1927) || ", "| 28 || 1929 || The Famous Cases of Dr. Thorndyke ||  || || viii, 1080 p., 8\u00ba || Lon: Hodder & Stoughton || || ", "| 29 || 1930 || Dr. Thorndyke Investigates ||  || || 159 p., 8\u00ba || Lon: Univ. of Lon.
