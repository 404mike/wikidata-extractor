Striker Roy Essandoh headed an injury-time winner to seal a 2\u20131 win for the Wanderers at Filbert Street. The semi-final at Villa Park saw Wycombe face Liverpool, and goals from Emile Heskey and Robbie Fowler put the Premiership side up 2\u20130. A last ditch effort from club mainstay Keith Ryan gave some hope to the Wanderers, but they would exit the competition after succumbing to a 2\u20131 defeat."]}, {"page": "Danny Morgan (footballer, born 1984)", "response": ["He scored four goals in six Conference South games on loan to Basingstoke Town, but his season was prematurely ended by a fractured jaw.

He made his debut on 17 February 2007 in the 3\u20132 home defeat of Sutton United. On 3 March 2007 Pearson scored his first goal for his new team in a 3\u20131 defeat at the hands of Farnborough Town; he grabbed a consolation goal on 75 minutes, shooting home from a corner. On 20 March 2007 he scored both goals in the 1\u20132 away victory against Hayes, he scored the equaliser on 41 minutes after a free kick right to left of the box was headed to him; the second came on 50 minutes when Turner's through ball set up Pearson who held the defender off well before shooting past Davies for a brace. On 3 April 2007 he scored the first goal in the 2\u20132 draw against Newport County on 13 minutes when a through ball released Turner who passed across for Pearson who then scored. On 7 April 2007 in the 4\u20133 victory over Dorchester Town Pearson put them 3\u20130 up when he came on as a substitute for the unwell Roy Essandoh on 26 minutes and taking 4 minutes to score from a through ball, bypassing the defence before shooting into the net. On 14 April 2007 Pearson scored an equaliser to make it 1\u20131 against Bedford Town, Essandoh's low cross on the left flank reached the near post where Pearson swept the ball into the opposite corner, the game finishing 2\u20132."]}, {"page": "History of Wycombe Wanderers F.C.", "response": ["The Chairboys had reached the giddy heights of the Quarter-finals and were rewarded with a trip to Filbert Street to take on Leicester City, flying high in fourth place in the Premier League. The club had been unable to do a deal to sign Parkin permanently from Chelsea and sent out an SOS for a striker which was even advertised on teletext. Northern Irish front man Roy Essandoh answered the call and made his debut in 1\u20130 defeat at home to Port Vale. A week later 3,202 Chairboys and girls made the journey up to Leicestershire and saw Manchester United loanee George Clegg and Wanderers legend Keith Ryan lead the attack against the Foxes. After a goalless first half Paul McCarthy scored his fifth FA Cup goal, diving in to head home Steve Brown's free-kick from close range. The dream appeared to have been dashed when Muzzy Izzet finished off a fine move to equalise twenty minutes later but the underdogs brushed off that disappointment and after Robbie Savage had to be substituted through injury and Essandoh replaced Ryan they seized the initiative in the final ten minutes and looked to have a good penalty shout turned down after Stefan Oakes appeared to handle in the area. Lawrie Sanchez was incensed and walked out of his technical area and down the touchline to remonstrate with the linesman. As the game went into injury-time Bulman swung in a cross to far post where Bates headed the ball back for Essandoh to leap like the proverbial salmon and head powerfully past Royce into the top corner. It was a sensational moment and although referee Steve Bennett played the role of spoilsport by showing Steve Brown a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration, there was little time for Leicester to come back and he blew the final whistle to confirm one of the biggest shocks in the competition's history. It sparked wild scenes of elation and disbelief as Wycombe Wanderers, a Football League club for less than eight years, were through to the semi-finals of the FA Cup."]}, {"page": "List of Motherwell F.C. players", "response": ["|Roy Essandoh||||1994\u20131997||5||0||"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Motherwell F.C. season", "response": ["| Roy Essandoh"]}, {"page": "List of foreign Veikkausliiga players", "response": ["* Roy Essandoh \u2013 VPS \u2013 1998\u20132000"]}, {"page": "Essandoh", "response": ["*Roy Essandoh (born 1976), Northern Ireland footballer"]}]}}
