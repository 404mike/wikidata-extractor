In an interview for the magazine Drapers, former Moss Bros managing director Manny Silverman described Ingram as: \"one of the leading commercially innovative retailers of the 1960s; always a leader, never a follower. Without him, the King's Road might never have happened\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* John Michael Ingram"]}, {"page": "John Ingram", "response": ["*John Michael Ingram (1931\u20132014), British menswear designer and founder of Design Intelligence forecasting agency."]}, {"page": "Jeremy Hackett", "response": ["Hackett was brought up and educated at Clifton College, Clifton, Bristol.
