Known as The Man with the Golden Voice, he filled cabarets, nightclubs, music halls, and stadiums around the world in his 30-year career. AllMusic has described Monro as \"one of the most underrated pop vocalists of the '60s\", who \"possessed the easiest, most perfect baritone in the business\".\nHis recordings include the UK Top 10 hits: \"Portrait of My Love\", \"My Kind of Girl\", \"Softly As I Leave You\", \"Walk Away\" and \"Yesterday\" (originally by The Beatles). He also recorded several film themes such as \"From Russia with Love\" for the James Bond film of the same name, \"Born Free\" for the film of the same name and \"On Days Like These\" for The Italian Job.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Natacha Atlas", "response": ["In 1999, Atlas collaborated with David Arnold on the song \"One Brief Moment\".

Mancini's style symbolized the bright, confident, hospitable voice of bourgeois, inspired by the idealistic Kennedy-era of the 1960s. Some of the artists who have recorded Mancini songs include Andy Williams, Paul Anka, Pat Boone, Anita Bryant, Jack Jones, Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Connie Francis, Eydie Gorme, Steve Lawrence, Trini Lopez, George Maharis, Johnny Mathis, Jerry Vale, Ray Conniff, Quincy Jones, The Lennon Sisters, The Lettermen, Herb Alpert, Eddie Cano, Frank Chacksfield, Warren Covington, Sarah Vaughan, Shelly Manne, James Moody, Percy Faith, Ferrante & Teicher, Horst Jankowski, Andre Kostelanetz, Peter Nero, Liberace, Mantovani, Tony Bennett, Julie London, Wayne Newton, Arthur Fiedler, Secret Agent and the Boston Pops Orchestra,  Peggy Lee, and Matt Monro. The Anita Kerr Quartet won a Grammy award (1965) for their album We Dig Mancini, a cover of his songs. Lawrence Welk held Mancini in very high regard, and frequently featured Mancini's music on The Lawrence Welk Show (Mancini made at least two guest appearances on the show). Mancini briefly hosted his own musical variety TV show in a similar format to Welk's, The Mancini Generation, which aired in syndication during the 1972\u201373 season."]}, {"page": "George Martin", "response": ["Martin was contacted by Sid Coleman of Ardmore & Beechwood, who told him about Brian Epstein, the manager of a band whom he had met.

Until that time, although there had been considerable success with comedy records, and a number 1 hit with the Temperance Seven, Martin had only minor success with pop music, such as \"Who Could Be Bluer\" by Jerry Lordan, and singles with Shane Fenton and Matt Monro. After the telephone call by Coleman, Martin arranged a meeting on 13 February 1962 with Brian Epstein. Martin listened to a tape recorded at Decca, and thought that Epstein's group was \"rather unpromising\", but liked the sound of Lennon's and McCartney's vocals.", "Martin produced recordings for many other artists, including contemporaries of the Beatles, such as Matt Monro, Cilla Black, Gerry & The Pacemakers, Billy J.
