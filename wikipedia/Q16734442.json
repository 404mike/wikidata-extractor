Even Burgess himself, who wrote the script based on his novel, was disappointed. According to The Evening Standard, he called the score, written by Bono and The Edge of the rock group U2, \"neo-wallpaper\". Burgess had originally worked alongside the director of the production, Ron Daniels, and envisioned a musical score that was entirely classical. Unhappy with the decision to abandon that score, he heavily criticised the band's experimental mix of hip hop, liturgical and gothic music. Lise Hand of The Irish Independent reported The Edge as saying that Burgess's original conception was \"a score written by a novelist rather than a songwriter\". Calling it \"meaningless glitz\", Jane Edwardes of 20/20 magazine said that watching this production was \"like being invited to an expensive French Restaurant \u2013 and being served with a Big Mac.\""]}, {"page": "Melanie Phillips", "response": ["She joined The Guardian newspaper in 1977, becoming its social services correspondent and social policy leader writer.

The theatre critic of The Guardian, Michael Billington, described the play as \"degrading and quasi-pornographic.\" As with most of Ridley's work, however, the critical response was deeply divided, with Sheridan Morley describing it as \"a masterpiece\" and John Peter, of The Sunday Times, declaring, \"Ridley's work is an acquired taste and it looks like I'm getting it.\""]}, {"page": "Mercury Fur", "response": ["In contrast, the play\u2019s violent content was defended by a variety of reviewers. Kate Bassett wrote that \"One might complain that Ridley is a puerile shock jock [or] wonder if the playwright isn't indulging in his own nasty fantasies or even encouraging copycat sadism [\u2026] Ridley is writing in the tradition of Greek and Jacobean tragedies. He underlines that brutality warps, suggests that love and morals persist, and is deliberately creating a nightmare scenario rife with allusions to actual world news.\"  Other critics felt that the play justified any shock or offense it might cause. The Independent's Paul Taylor wrote that \"the play has the right to risk toying with being offensive to bring home just how morally unsettling this depraved, perverted-kicks world has become. If you could sit through it unaffronted on the artistic level, it would surely have failed in its mission.\" Likewise, John Peter wrote that \"Ridley is an observer, shocked and conscientious, as appalled as you are. But he understands the mechanics of cruelty and the minds of people who are fascinated by cruelty and take an obscure pleasure in moralising about it. Ridley doesn't moralise, but he expects you to respond, and he delivers a moral shock.\" Some other critics also felt that the play contained moral content, such as Aleks Sierz who called it \"a very moral play, in which the bad end badly, and the good go down tragically\".", "Some critics saw political resonances in the play along with allusions to real-world events. The Herald's Carole Woddis wrote that \"Ridley\u2019s upsetting portrayal is, I believe, an honourable response to the genocides in Rwanda and atrocities in Iraq\". John Peter declared that \"Philip Ridley has written the ultimate 9/11 play: a play for the age of Bush and Bin Laden, of Donald Rumsfeld and Charles Clarke; a play for our time, when a sense of terror is both nameless and precise.\" However, Paul Taylor found that \"the political context is too conveniently hazy\", and John Gross wrote that \"any political arguments are lost amid the sadistic fantasies, kinky rituals, gruesome anecdotes and flights of science fiction\", with similar comments coming from Brian Logan: \"whatever questions playwright Philip Ridley seeks to pose are drowned out by the shrieking and bloodshed\".", "Critics were also split on the credibility of the play\u2019s world and its speculative depiction of societal collapse. Michael Billington was critical, stating that he distrusted the play \"from its reactionary despair and assumption that we are all going to hell in a handcart\" along with writing that it succumbed \"to a fashionable nihilism\" and that Ridley\u2019s portrayal of social-breakdown \"flies in the face of a mass of evidence one could produce to the contrary.\" In contrast, Alastair Macaulay described the play as a \"realistic nightmare\" which portrayed \"a kind of believable hell [\u2026] like the darkest parallel-universe version of the world we know\". Aleks Sierz felt that the play\u2019s conclusion was \"utterly convincing, even if - in our liberal souls - it seems like a wild exaggeration.\" In contrast Brian Logan wrote that \"I never really believed in \u2018Mercury Fur\u2019. Its futuristic setting is more hypothetical than real; it also absolves the audience of moral complicity\", whilst John Peter wrote that \"most science fiction is moral fiction\".", "Despite this, there were critics that were especially supportive. Alastair Macaulay described the play as \"an amazing feat of imagination, engrossing and poetic\" whilst Aleks Sierz wrote that the play \"makes you feel alive when you're watching it\" and declared it to be \"probably the best new play of the year\".
