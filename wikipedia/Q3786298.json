She is the youngest athlete ever to be on the podium at successive debut World Cup races and the youngest triathlete to have ever been ranked World Number One at only 18 years old. Still to this day, Avil is the youngest triathlete to have competed in the Olympic Games.In 2007 Avil was shortlisted for BBC Young Sports Personality of the year. In 2008, she was crowned British Olympic Association Triathlete of the Year.\nAvil competed in triathlon at the 2008 Summer Olympics but did not finish the race.  Like her coach, Bright's, other athlete, Tim Don, she suffered a sickness that caused her continual vomiting and weakness during the race. During the bike section, Avil had to retire.\nAvil started her degree at Loughborough University shortly after her Olympic journey in summer of 2008. Her 2009 season started with disappointment at the Madrid World Championship Series as she failed to finish the race due to mechanical problems with her bike. However, Avil's 2009 season ended on a high as she was crowned U23 World Champion on the Gold Coast, Australia.\nIn December 2011, Avil was one of 12 British female sporting celebrities who posed for Clara Maidment a charity calendar in aid of Wellbeing of Women, in the lingerie of Nichole de Carle, wearing jewellery by Salima Hughes and Coster Diamonds.In May 2012, Avil announced her retirement from competitive sport following her recovery from an eating disorder.In late 2012 Avil moved to Singapore to pursue a career in sports marketing and event management.\nAvil works as a Relationship Manager for Manchester United, for three years based in Hong Kong, returning in 2019 to rejoin UK operations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ben Bright", "response": ["Bright is now the head coach for the British Triathlon High Performance centre in Loughborough.

In the World Championship Rankings 2010, Hewitt was number sixth. In France, Hewitt again represented Beauvais in the Lyonnaise des Eaux circuit and again played the decisive role. At Dunkirk and at Tourangeaux she won the gold medal, at the Grand Final of the Lyonnaise circuit in La Baule (Triathlon Audencia) she won silver. Hewitt did not take part at Beauvais and Paris, where Hollie Avil was the best triathlete of her club. Thus in 2010 again Beauvais owes its first place in the overall ranking of the French Club Championship to Andrea Hewitt and Hollie Avil, Anja Dittmer, and Vicky Holland. At La Baule there were no French triathletes among the three  of Beauvais at all."]}, {"page": "Triathlon at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["|   Emma Snowsill Debbie Tanner Laura Bennett Anja Dittmer Joelle Franzman Hollie Avil Andrea Hewitt Nicola Spirig Lauren Groves Elizabeth May Jessica Harrison Magali di Marco Ricarda Lisk Erin Densham Carole P\u00e9on Eva Dollinger Kiyomi Niwata Juri Ide Nadia Cortassa Lisa Nord\u00e9n Daniela Ryf Kathy Tremblay Kirsten Sweetland Vendula Frintov\u00e1 Ainhoa Murua Irina Abyssova Kate Roberts Mariana Ohata Tania Haib\u00f6ck Lenka Zemanova Ana Burgos Kate Allen Ewa Dederko Emma Davis Xing Lin Lisa Mensik Wang Hongni Maria Czesnik Yuliya Spunova Olga Zaousailova Charlotte Bonin Zita Szab\u00f3 Birgitta Berk"]}, {"page": "Emmie Charayron", "response": ["Thanks to Emmie Charayron, in 2009 her French triathlon club Brive Limousin placed eighth in the prestigious French Club Championship Series Lyonnaise des Eaux and achieved this top-ten placement without hiring foreign champions.
