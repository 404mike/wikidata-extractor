A member of the Grace family and an elder brother of E. M., W. G. and Fred, he was born in Downend, near Bristol, and died in Honiton. He appeared in three first-class matches as a righthanded batsman who bowled right arm medium pace with a roundarm action. He did not pursue a cricket career like his brothers as he entered the medical profession on a full-time basis. He scored four runs with a highest score of 4 and took three wickets with a best analysis of three for 48.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "W. G. Grace", "response": ["W. G. Grace was born in Downend, near Bristol, on 18 July 1848 at his parents' home, Downend House, and was baptised at the local church on 8 August.Rae, p.16. He was called Gilbert in the family circle, except by his mother, who apparently called him Willie, but otherwise, as \"W. G.\", he was universally known by his initials. His parents were Henry Mills Grace and Martha (n\u00e9e Pocock), who were married in Bristol on Thursday, 3 November 1831 and lived out their lives at Downend, where Henry Grace was the local GP.Rae, pp.9\u201311. Downend is near Mangotsfield and, although it is now a suburb of Bristol, it was then \"a distinct village surrounded by countryside\" and about four miles from Bristol.Rae, p.11. Henry and Martha Grace had nine children in all: \"the same number as Victoria and Albert\u00a0\u2013 and in every respect they were the typical Victorian family\".Rae, pp.12\u201313. Grace was the eighth child in the family; he had three older brothers, including E. M. Grace (always known as \"E. M.\"), and four older sisters. The ninth child was his younger brother Fred Grace, born in 1850.Midwinter, pp.9\u201310.", "Grace began his Cricketing Reminiscences (1899) by answering a question he had frequently been asked: i.e., was he \"born a cricketer\"? His answer was in the negative because he believed that \"cricketers are made by coaching and practice\", though he adds that if he was not born a cricketer, he was born \"in the atmosphere of cricket\".Grace, Reminiscences, p.1. His father and mother were \"full of enthusiasm for the game\" and it was \"a common theme of conversation at home\".Grace, Reminiscences, p.2. In 1850, when W. G. was two and Fred was expected, the family moved to a nearby house called \"The Chesnuts\" which had a sizeable orchard and Henry Grace organised clearance of this to establish a practice pitch. All nine children in the Grace family, including the four daughters, were encouraged to play cricket although the girls, along with the dogs, were required for fielding only.Midwinter, p.11. Grace claimed that he first handled a cricket bat at the age of two.Midwinter, pp.11\u201312. It was in the Downend orchard and as members of their local cricket clubs that he and his brothers developed their skills, mainly under the tutelage of his uncle, Alfred Pocock, who was an exceptional coach. Apart from his cricket and his schooling, Grace lived the life of a country boy and roamed freely with the other village boys. One of his regular activities was stone throwing at birds in the fields and he later claimed that this was the source of his eventual skill as an outfielder.Rae, p.21.", "Henry Grace founded Mangotsfield Cricket Club in 1845 to represent several neighbouring villages including Downend. In 1846, this club merged with the West Gloucestershire Cricket Club whose name was adopted until 1867.Rae, p.15. It has been said that the Grace family ran the West Gloucestershire \"almost as a private club\". Henry Grace managed to organise matches against Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath, which was the premier West Country club. West Gloucestershire fared poorly in these games and, sometime in the 1850s, Henry and Alfred Pocock decided to join Lansdown, although they continued to run the West Gloucestershire and this remained their primary club.Rae, p.34.", "It is generally understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace's West Gloucestershire club.Birley, p. 104. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2, 3 and 4 June 1870. With Grace and his brothers E. M. and Fred playing, Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly became one of the best teams in England. The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874.Webber, County Championship, pp. 14\u201320. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership with Frank Townsend (89) of 234. The Grace family \"ran the show\" at Gloucestershire and E. M. was chosen as secretary which, as Birley points out, \"put him in charge of expenses, a source of scandal that was to surface before the end of the decade\". W. G., though aged only 21, was from the start the team captain and Birley puts this down to his \"commercial drawing power\".", "Despite living in London for many years, Grace never lost his Gloucestershire accent.Rae, p.1. His entire life, including his cricket and medical careers, is inseparable from his close-knit family background which was strongly influenced by his father Henry Grace, who set great store by qualifications and was determined to succeed.Rae mentions on page 3 that Dr Henry Grace's medical qualifications were Licenciate of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA) in 1828 and Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) in 1830. He passed this attitude on to each of his five sons.Rae, p.3. Therefore, like his father and his brothers, Grace chose a professional career in medicine, though because of his cricketing commitments he did not complete his qualification as a doctor until 1879 when he was 31 years old."]}, {"page": "Fred Grace", "response": ["Like his brothers, Grace learned how to play cricket at home on a practice pitch that the family had created on the site of a former orchard. He was coached by his father, Dr Henry Grace, and his uncle, Alfred Pocock. His mother, Martha, was a keen participant too and she provided the driving force and the motivation which crystallised into the competitive edge that EM, WG and Fred always had as first-class players. EM, several years older than WG and Fred, learned to play using a full size bat and, because it was too big for him as a boy, he developed a tendency to hit across the line of delivery instead of playing straight. Alfred Pocock recognised this fault and decided that WG and Fred must learn to play straight by using small bats, suitable for their boyhood sizes. It meant that WG and Fred became technically correct batsmen with strong defensive techniques whereas EM remained primarily an attacking batsman. "]}, {"page": "Lansdown Cricket Club", "response": ["As the years passed, Lansdown's reputation grew, and their opposition similarly grew in reputation, as they entertained Oxford University and the MCC.  In 1852, they played host at Sydenham Field to an All-England Eleven, Lansdown fielded 22 men and, after three days, the match finished a draw.  W. G. Grace made his debut for Lansdown on 5 July 1861, just short of his thirteenth birthday, and played two matches during that month.  A few years later, in 1865 when Lansdown entertained United England Eleven, their side contained three of the Grace brothers, with E.M. and Henry Grace also playing.  Between the three of them, they took all of the England side's wickets in the match as Lansdown won by an innings and 113 runs.  In 1869, the club moved to Combe Park, where it has played ever since."]}, {"page": "Grace family", "response": ["*Henry Mills Grace (1808\u201371), played for West Gloucestershire and South Wales in 1855.Other matches played by Henry Grace  \u2013 CricketArchive.

The South Wales captain wanted to drop Grace for the second match against the Gentlemen of Sussex at the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove, but Henry Grace intervened and insisted that Grace must play as he was \"recruited for both games\".Midwinter, p.23. Henry Grace apparently informed the captain that no member of his family, including E.M. who was then the star turn, would represent South Wales in future. The captain backed down and Grace played at Hove but under great pressure to succeed. He certainly did succeed for he scored 170 and 56 not out. His innings of 170 was his first-ever century in a serious match. The third match, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was Grace's debut at Lord's and he was joined by E.M. who had just disembarked from his voyage.Rae, p.54.
