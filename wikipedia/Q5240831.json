In all first-class matches, he scored 8139 runs at an average of 38.39, with 16 centuries and a highest score of 294 not out. He scored \"a remarkable 2,072 first-class runs in 1990, including seven hundreds\".Nicknamed \"Gnasher\" for his prominent teeth, Ward was something of a cult personality as a player. He is now a coach at Whitgift School, where his pupils have included England opening batsmen Rory Burns, Jason Roy and Dom Sibley, and several other players for Surrey, such as Freddie van den Bergh, Laurie Evans and Jamie Smith.\nWithin the conservative and restrictive world of cricket whites, Ward was able to demonstrate a little eccentricity, occasionally choosing to wear a cap or even helmet decorated in the traditional Harlequin pattern more associated with Douglas Jardine and other players of yester-year.\nWard currently plays club cricket for Old Whitgiftians C.C. in the Surrey Championship when his school duties allow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whitgift School", "response": ["* David Ward, cricket coach who, having retired from playing for Surrey, produced a stream of cricketers for the England team."]}, {"page": "David Ward", "response": ["David Ward may refer to:", "*David Ward (American football) (1907\u20131982), American football end", "*David Ward (bowls) (1945\u20132005), England lawn and indoor bowler", "*David Ward (British politician) (born 1953), British Liberal Democrat politician, MP for Bradford East (2010\u20132015)", "*David Ward (cricketer, born 1981), Australian-born English former cricketer", "*David Ward (diplomat), British diplomat", "*David Ward (palaeontologist) (born 1948), British palaeontologist", "*David Ward (rugby league) (born 1953), English rugby league footballer", "*David Ward (sheriff), law enforcement officer in Oregon", "*David Ward (bass) (1922\u20131983), operatic bass", "*David Ward (Surrey cricketer) (born 1961), English batsman", "*David Ward (university president) (born 1938), president of the American Council on Education, 2001\u20132008", "*David Ward (Wisconsin politician) (born 1953), American Republican politician from Wisconsin", "*David Ward, 5th Earl of Dudley (born 1947), British peer", "* David Ward (1936\u20132016), known as Kiviaq, Inuit lawyer, politician, and former athlete", "*David Ward King (1857\u20131920), farmer and inventor", "*David Ward-Steinman (1936\u20132015), composer"]}, {"page": "David M Ward", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Ward (Surrey cricketer)"]}, {"page": "David M.
