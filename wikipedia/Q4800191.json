Rear Admiral Arthur Rullion Rattray, second-in-command to the Royal Indian Navy, and the commanding officer at the Bombay Harbour conducted an inspection in person which confirmed that the unrest was widespread and beyond his control. Rattray insisted on a parley with the mutineers but Auchinleck and Godfrey were both opposed to the idea. The events at HMIS Talwar had motivated sailors across Bombay and the Royal Indian Navy to join in by the prospects of a revolution to overthrow the British Raj and in solidarity with the grievances of their naval fraternity."]}, {"page": "No. 104 Squadron RAF", "response": ["The squadron was formed at Wyton, England on 4 September 1917 equipped with the DH 9.

One of these victories was over Vfw. Heinrich Krueger of Jasta 70. Three days later, at 1830 hours, Harrop and Smith drove another Pfalz down out of control, to make both men aces. Both were taken prisoner on 22 August 1918 after a raid on Mannheim. Harrop's final score was 1 (& 1 shared) destroyed, 2 (& 1 shared) 'out of control'.Franks et.al.

After a short stint, in February 1947, he took command of HMIS Venduruthy as the Naval Officer-in-charge Cochin. Soon after taking over, he saw the potential of the base and envisioned the development of Cochin as a combined training base. With Nott's efforts, multiple training establishments were set up in Cochin. On 31 May 1947, he was promoted to the substantive rank of captain."]}]}}
