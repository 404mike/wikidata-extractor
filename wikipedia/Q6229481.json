These writings did not make Johnson much money, but they agreed with his philosophy of open debate and religious toleration.

They adopted adult baptism, and Godly republicanism; and they were egalitarians who sought to promote extreme revolutionary ideals.  The movement gained popularity among dissenting nonconformists in the early 18th century.  English Presbyterians were attracted to the second city at Norwich, by its emerging scientific community, which in the wake of the Enlightenment was particularly strong in Scotland.  They began to become a formal denomination in 1774 when Theophilus Lindsey organized meetings with Joseph Priestley, founding the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in the country, at Essex Street Church in London.  In 1791 Lindsey and his colleague John Disney were behind the \"first organized denominational Unitarian society\", formally The Unitarian Society for promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue by the Distribution of Books but more simply known as the Unitarian Book Society. This was followed by The Unitarian Fund (1806), which sent out missionaries and financially supported poorer congregations. Unitarianism was not fully legal in the United Kingdom until the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, a bill largely pushed forward in Parliament by William Smith, and thus known sometimes under his name, or as the Unitarian Relief Act (Trinity Act) or The Unitarian Toleration Bill.Maclear J.F.
