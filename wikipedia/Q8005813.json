Battery during the First World War when the following deed took place on 6 August 1917 east of Lempire, France for which he was awarded the VC.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery when in charge of a Stokes gun in trenches which were being heavily shelled. Suddenly one of the fly-off levers of a Stokes shell came off and fired the shell in the emplacement. Private Butler picked up the shell and jumped to the entrance of the emplacement, which at that moment a party of infantry were passing. He shouted to them to hurry past as the shell was going off, and turning round, placed himself between the party of men and the live shell and so held it till they were out of danger. He then threw the shell on to the parados, and took cover in the bottom of the trench. The shell exploded almost on leaving his hand, greatly damaging the trench. By extreme good luck Private Butler was contused only. Undoubtedly his great presence of mind and disregard of his own life saved the lives of the officer and men in the emplacement and the party which was passing at the time.\nThe Stokes gun was a 3-inch trench mortar invented by Sir Wilfred Stokes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Armley", "response": ["*William Boynton Butler VC, Croix de Guerre \u2013 born in Armley in 1894"]}, {"page": "William Butler", "response": ["* William Boynton Butler (1894\u20131972), British Army soldier awarded a Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["| William Boynton Butler || British Army ||  1917 || First World War || Lempire"]}, {"page": "West Yorkshire Regiment", "response": ["*Private William Boynton Butler, Great War"]}, {"page": "List of people from Leeds", "response": ["* William Boynton Butler VC - recipient of the Victoria Cross in 1917"]}]}}
