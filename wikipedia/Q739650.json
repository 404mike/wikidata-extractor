They first  performed in public at an end-of-year show in April 1973 as members of a one-off school-band called Obelisk. That band consisted of Robert Smith on piano, Michael \"Mick\" Dempsey on guitar, Laurence \"Lol\" Tolhurst on percussion, Marc Ceccagno on lead guitar and Alan Hill on bass guitar. In January 1976, while at St Wilfrid's Comprehensive School, Ceccagno formed a five-piece rock band with Smith on guitar and Dempsey on bass, along with two other school friends.Ten Imaginary Years, by L. Barbarian, Steve Sutherland and Robert Smith (1988) Zomba Books  They called themselves Malice, and rehearsed David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix and Alex Harvey songs in a local church-hall.The Cure, A History in Spiral Scratch Magazine by Rachel Doran, April 1992 By late April 1976 Ceccagno and the other two school-friends had left, and Tolhurst (drums), Martin Creasy (vocals), and Porl Thompson (guitar) had joined the band.Barbarian, Sutherland, Smith (1988) This lineup played all three of Malice's only documented live-shows during December 1976. In January 1977, following Martin Creasy's departure, and increasingly influenced by the emergence of punk rock, Malice's remaining members became known as Easy Cure \u2013 after a song written by Tolhurst.", "On 22 April 1978 Easy Cure played their last gig at the Montefiore Institute Hall (in the Three Bridges neighbourhood of Crawley)Anomolie, Sureaud, Michaux, Ramage (1990\u2013'92) before guitarist Porl Thompson was dropped from the lineup because his lead-guitar style was at odds with Smith's growing preference for minimalist songwriting.Sutherland (1990) Smith soon renamed the remaining trio  \"The Cure\". Later that month the band recorded their first sessions as a trio at Chestnut Studios in Sussex, producing a demo tape for distribution to a dozen major record-labels. The demo found its way to Polydor Records scout Chris Parry, who signed the Cure to his newly-formed Fiction label\u2014distributed by Polydor\u2014in September 1978. The Cure released their debut single \"Killing an Arab\" in December 1978 on the Small Wonder label as a stopgap until Fiction finalised distribution arrangements with Polydor. \"Killing an Arab\" garnered both acclaim and controversy: while the single's provocative title led to accusations of racism, the song is actually based on French existentialist Albert Camus's novel The Stranger. The band placed a sticker label that denied the racist connotations on the single's 1979 reissue on Fiction. An early NME article on the band wrote that the Cure \"are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital's smog-ridden pub-and-club circuit\", and noted: \"With a John Peel session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda, it remains to be seen whether the Cure can retain their refreshing joie de vivre.\"", "In 1984, the Cure released The Top, a generally psychedelic album on which Smith played most of the instruments except the drums (played by Andy Anderson) and the saxophone (played by Porl Thompson). The album was a Top 10 hit in the UK, and was their first studio album to break the Billboard 200 in the US, reaching number 180. Melody Maker praised the album as \"psychedelia that can't be dated\", while pondering, \"I've yet to meet anyone who can tell me why the Cure are having hits now of all times.\" The Cure then embarked on their worldwide Top Tour with Thompson, Anderson and producer-turned-bassist Phil Thornalley on board. Released in late 1984, the Cure's first live album, Concert consisted of performances from this tour. Near the tour's end, Anderson was fired for destroying a hotel room and was replaced by Boris Williams. Thornalley also left because of the stress of touring. However, the bassist slot was not vacant long, for a Cure roadie named Gary Biddles had brokered a reunion between Smith and former bassist Simon Gallup, who had been playing in the band Fools Dance. Soon after reconciling, Smith asked Gallup to rejoin the band. Smith was ecstatic about Gallup's return and declared to Melody Maker, \"It's a group again.\"", "In May 2005, O'Donnell and Bamonte were fired from the band. O'Donnell claims Smith informed him he was reducing the band to a three-piece. Previously O'Donnell said he had only found out about the band's upcoming tour dates via a fan site and added, \"It was sad to find out after nearly twenty years the way I did, but then I should have expected no less or more.\" The remaining members of the band\u2014Smith, Gallup and Cooper\u2014made several appearances as a trio before Porl Thompson returned to the Cure's lineup for their summer 2005 tour. In July 2005, the band performed a set at the Paris concert of the Live 8 series of benefit concerts.", "In NME's cover article for March 2012, the Cure announced that they would be headlining a series of summer music festivals across Europe, including the Leeds/Reading Festival. On 1 May, Porl Thompson, now known as Pearl Thompson, announced that they had left the Cure. On 26 May, the Cure embarked on a 19-date summer festival tour of Europe, commencing at the Pinkpop Festival, joined by former the Cure/COGASM collaborator Reeves Gabrels on guitar. On the same day, it was announced that Gabrels would be standing in for the tour, but at that point was not a fully-fledged member of the band. Several weeks into the tour, the band invited Gabrels to become a member and he accepted."]}, {"page": "Three Imaginary Boys", "response": ["The album was reissued on 29 November 2004 and featured a second disc of unreleased material, including songs recorded under the band name Easy Cure with Porl Thompson.

With Simon Gallup's departure reducing the group to a duo, and Tolhurst quitting drums to start taking keyboard lessons, from July 1982 until Gallup's return in February 1985, according to Smith, much of the writing and recording process within The Cure effectively became a solo effort.  Nonetheless, Tolhurst was credited as co-writer of five of the eight songs featured on 1983's singles and b-sides collection Japanese Whispers (including \"Let's Go to Bed\" and \"The Walk\"), while \"The Love Cats\", \"Lament\" and \"The Dream\" were credited to Smith only.True, Chris. \"Japanese Whispers \u2013 The Cure\", Allmusic.com; retrieved 29 October 2012.

Notably, starting with The Top, in 1984, Smith started incorporating Spanish acoustic guitars (notably on the songs \"Birdmad Girl\", and \"The Caterpillar\"), and from the mid-80s onward Smith included more acoustic guitar instrumentation on later Cure songs such as \"The Blood\", as well as notable singles such as \"In Between Days\", \"Just Like Heaven\", and \"Friday I\u2019m In Love\". On the 1987 release Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Smith showcased a diverse style of guitar playing across the 17-track album. Notably on the opening track \"The Kiss\" where Smith played an extended Wah-wah pedal introductory solo that opened the LP, as well as the single \"Hot Hot Hot!!!\" where Smith included an intricate funk playing style that intersected with Porl Thompson's guitar lines. Another ingredient of Smith\u2019s guitar sound is the Fender VI, which proved to be a staple of The Cure\u2019s sound during the early 80\u2019s on Cure albums such as Faith, was used as the main instrument on the Carnage Visors instrumental soundtrack that the band recorded that same year, and it was later played by Smith extensively on the 1989 release Disintegration.

Three singles were released during 1982 and 1983 that were a significant divergence in style; essentially, pop hits. \"The Love Cats\" became the band's first single to infiltrate the top ten in the United Kingdom, peaking at number seven. This shift is attributed to Smith's frustration over the band's labelling as a predictable gothic rock band: \"My reaction to all those people\u00a0... was to make a demented and calculated song like 'Let's Go to Bed'.\" Following the return of guitarist Porl Thompson and bassist Simon Gallup and the addition of drummer Boris Williams in 1984, Smith and keyboardist Lol Tolhurst continued to integrate more pop-oriented themes with the release of the group's sixth studio album The Head on the Door (1985). With the singles \"In-Between Days\" and \"Close to Me\", the band became a viable commercial force in the United States for the first time.", "Disintegration is characterized by a significant usage of synthesizers and keyboards, slow, \"droning\" guitar progressions and Smith's introspective vocals. \"Plainsong\", the album's opener, \"set the mood for Disintegration perfectly\", according to biographer Jeff Apter, by \"unravelling ever so slowly in a shower of synths and guitars, before Smith steps up to the mic, uttering snatches of lyrics ('I'm so cold') as if he were reading from something as sacred as the Dead Sea Scroll.\" Smith felt the song was a perfect opener for the record, describing it as \"very lush, very orchestral\". The album's third track, \"Closedown\", contains layers of keyboard texture complemented with a slow, gloomy guitar line. The track was written by Smith as a means to list his physical and artistic shortcomings. Despite the dark mood present throughout Disintegration, \"Lovesong\" was an upbeat track that became a hit in the United States. Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted the difference from other songs: \"the Simon Gallup/Boris Williams rhythm section create a tight, serviceable dance groove, while Smith and Porl Thompson add further guitar fills and filigrees as well, adding just enough extra bite to the song.

Robert Smith also revealed the hit song 'Friday I'm In Love' was purposely sped up a quarter-tone sharp on the recording tape, halfway between D and E-flat. Robert Smith commented on the speeding up of the tape of the song in a 1993 interview. \"[\u2026] that was an accident. I was playing with the vari-speed and forgot to turn it off. But the whole feel changed, and the fact that it's the only song on Wish that's not in concert pitch really lifts it out and makes it sound different.
