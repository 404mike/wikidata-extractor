He soon formed a friendship with future Iron Maiden guitarist Dave Murray, who inspired him to take up the guitar. After leaving school at 16, he formed a band called Urchin, which he led until their demise in 1980. He joined Iron Maiden in November 1980, replacing Dennis Stratton. Following a short-lived solo project called ASAP, he left Iron Maiden in 1990 and, after a year-long hiatus, formed the band The Untouchables, which later became Psycho Motel. In 1997, Psycho Motel was put on hold when Smith joined the band of former Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson. Smith and Dickinson would both return to Iron Maiden in 1999, after which the band gained new success. During his second tenure with Iron Maiden, Smith has also led the side projects Primal Rock Rebellion and Smith/Kotzen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian", "response": ["*Adrian Smith (born 1970), American politician", "*Adrian Smith (born 1946), British statistician", "*Adrian Smith  (born 1936), American basketball player", "*Adrian Smith (born 1964), British strongman", "*Adrian Smith (born 1957), English musician and one of three guitarists/songwriters in the English band Iron Maiden", "*Adrian Smith, British illustrator"]}, {"page": "February 27", "response": ["*  1957   \u2013 Adrian Smith, English guitarist and songwriter "]}, {"page": "Iron Maiden", "response": ["Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours.

The sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success, debuting at number one in the album charts of 24 countries with physical sales and summary in 43 territories with physical and digital sales. The seventeenth studio album Senjutsu was released on 3 September 2021 and eventually reached No.\u00a01 in 23 countries.", "In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI, and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, Adrian Smith of Urchin, to join the group as their second guitarist. Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and Dennis Stratton was hired instead. Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979. Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"Sanctuary\" and \"Wrathchild\". The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal (NWoBHM) movement. According to different sources between May 1976 and December 1979 the band played about 200 shows in Great Britain.", "Iron Maiden released their self-titled album in 1980, which debuted at No.\u00a04 in the UK Albums Chart. The album includes other early favourites such as \"Running Free\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"Sanctuary\" \u2013 which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980 with almost 40,000 in attendance. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with UFO headlining. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences, and was replaced by Adrian Smith in October 1980. In Europe Iron Maiden played 28 shows to about 400,000 people (mainly Kiss fans). In December musicians played Rainbow Theatre in London where the band's very first live video was filmed. Live at the Rainbow was released in May 1981 and the cuts \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" from this video received heavy rotation on MTV during its first hours on the air as the first metal videos ever.", "Returning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, Somewhere in Time. For the first time in the band's history, this featured synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound. The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single \"Wasted Years\", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band. While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was \"left to [his] own devices\" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea of Madness\", and \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", the last of which would be the album's second single. The album was the band's biggest American chart success to date, reaching No.\u00a011 on the Billboard 200 and No.\u00a02 in the UK charts. Album immediately reached Gold status in the UK and Platinum in the States where eventually went Double Platinum according to band's official biography \"Run to the Hills\". The Somewhere on Tour production was the most ambitious to date. Somewhere in Time features \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" as an opening track, anthemic \"Heaven Can wait\" and progressive epic opus \"Alexander the Great\" crowning the album. Band used seven 45 foot articulated trucks packed with over 100 tons of equipment, three crowd buses for 60 people and two nightliners for five musicians. The band \u2013 owned customised Turbosound system was probably the biggest in the world used indoors. Total power (PA and stage monitors) was estimated at 180,000 watts. The vast and flexible lighting rig held over 1100 lamps hanged over futuristic stage set including flying space ships, inflatable props, laser guns, pyrotechnics, hydraulic stands, backdrops and monumental Eddie's appearance.", "During another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990, followed by a tour. At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of ten CDs and double 12-inch singles. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides. Band also released the career spanning video compilation entitled The First Ten Years: The Videos in 1992 re-issued as From There to Eternity. The 1980s were closed by the group with over 25 million albums sold, of which 10 million in the US, over five million videos were sold only in the US, which gave Iron Maiden six of 120 Gold and Platinum certificates received worldwide. All those achievements sealed the group's status as the largest representative of the heavy metal genre. Musicians set new records in the UK: six Top 5 singles in the Top 5, 10 double maxi-singles in the Top 10, the highest position ever for a debut single from a rock band, the most albums in the Top 10 for a British performer, excluding The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and Queen, 20 singles consecutively released on the charts.", "Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards. Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years. The album, No Prayer for the Dying, was released in October 1990. It contained hit singles as \"Holy Smoke\" and \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", the band's first (and to date, only) UK Singles Chart No.\u00a01, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown. In 1990 Bruce Dickinson received the Golden Raspberry Awards in category The Worst Original Song for the band's most successful single in Great Britain. The album debuted at No.\u00a02 in the UK albums chart and No.\u00a017 on the Billboard 200. No Prayer for the Dying signalled the return of Iron Maiden to the roots of theirs musical style, in particular in its simplicity of composition and raw sound.", "After another extensive tour and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, Fear of the Dark, which was released in 1992. The title track is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third No.\u00a01 in the UK albums chart and No.\u00a012 on the Billboard 200, the release also included the No.\u00a02 single \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", the No.\u00a021 single \"From Here to Eternity\", \"Wasting Love\" and pacifistic anthem \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" based on Gulf War 1991. The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first ever Latin American leg (12 stadium and arena shows after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries: UK, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden. Iron Maiden's second performance at Donington Park, to sold-out audience of 75,000 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988), was filmed for the audio and video release Live at Donington, and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \"Running Free\". Christian organisations prevented Iron Maiden from performing in Chile and accused musicians of being \"emissaries of satanic propaganda\".", "thumb|Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three\u2013guitar line-up.", "The band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later. With Gers, Smith's replacement, remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up (called \"The Three Amigos\"), and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour. Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game of the same name starring the band's mascot. The 1999 reunion tour was the biggest enterprise in terms of production since Fear of the Dark Tour 1992. The band visited North America and several European countries to present the conceptual show inspired by scenes from the game. Iron Maiden used a two-part stage related to graphics from the promoted game, three movable screens surrounded by light ramps, projectors, huge backdrops, pyrotechnics (for the first time since 1988), colourful props, visuals and two types of Eddie in the version known from the game. The equipment travelled in seven huge trucks.", "The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style. Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he claims, \"evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\" Stating that he \"was inspired by blues rock rather than metal,\" Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a \"melodic player.\" Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore, which he claims is in contrast to Smith's \"rhythmic\" sound.", "Singer Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith, has an operatic vocal style, inspired by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill, Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan, and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.
