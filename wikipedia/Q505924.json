In an instance of island gigantism, the dormice were able to grow large in the absence of predators on these islands, which otherwise force rodents to hide in holes or cracks, requiring them to be small.

Carte systematically overhauled the museum's collections, cataloguing, naming and allocating all exhibits into organised groups. During this reorganisation Carte also solicited new acquisitions for the Museum from prominent figures such as Sir Richard Griffith, Sir William Wilde, Andrew Leith Adams, Edward Percival Wright, William Andrews, and Captain Sir Francis Leopold McClintock. Between 1851 and 1861, a large number of donations were made to the museum, most notably a collection of over 2500 bird skins.", "Apart from his museum work, Carte sat on the council of the RCSI for many years, and was a member of the Royal Irish Academy, the Linnean Society, and the Imperial Botanical and Zoological Society, Vienna. Carte had a keen interest in paleontology and the cave systems of Ireland. He published in the Royal Dublin Society Journal and the Geological Society of Dublin Journal on subjects from comparative anatomy to the possible existence of the polar bear in Ireland in the past. He published with William Hellier Baily naming a new species of plesiosaur, Rhomaleosaurus cramptoni. A fossil giant dormouse from Malta, Myoxus cartei adams, was named in Carte's honour by Andrew Leith Adams in 1863."]}]}}
