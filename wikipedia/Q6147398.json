Known for its surreal black comedy and horror, the franchise was immensely popular with children and adults, and the cartoon became one of the most-watched programmes on CITV in the 2000s; a reboot of the cartoon series was produced for Nickelodeon UK and NickToons UK in 2011 with 26 episodes (split into 2 series) with the added tagline of Cautionary Tales for Lovers of Squeam!. The first four books in the series were published between 1990 and 2001 by a variety of publishers (such as Hodder Children's Books, Puffin, and Scholastic) and have since gone out of print but are available as audio adaptations through Audible and iTunes. The ITV cartoon was produced by Honeycomb Animation and aired between 2000 and 2006 with 6 series; reruns aired on the Nickelodeon channels along with the 2011 series.", "The franchise received critical acclaim, noted by the themes of horror surrealism and adult paranoia blended with common children's book absurdity. The Daily Telegraph said of the CITV cartoon, \"Mix Dahl with Belloc and you can anticipate with glee these animated tales of Jamie Rix. Even William Brown's antics pale...\" and The Sunday Times wrote: \"They are superior morality stories and Nigel Planer reads them with a delight that borders on the fiendish.\"", "Naming conventions highlighted the humour. The Independent on Sunday pointed out, \"Jamie Rix\u2019s splendidly nasty short stories can be genuinely scary, but as the protagonists are obnoxious brats with names like Peregrine and Tristram, you may find yourself cheering as they meet their sticky ends.\" Some of the characters' surnames implied their roles in the story (Mr. and Mrs. Frightfully-Busy were workaholics, Johnny Bullneck is an aggressive school bully, and Serena Slurp is greedy) whereas the more ridiculous the family name is, the more unpleasant they are in the story: Fedora Funkelfink the con artist; and the upper-middle-class Crumpdump family, who trophy hunt to impress their spoilt children. \"Knock Down Ginger\", meanwhile, is set in a fictional town called Nimby, a notorious home for middle-class snobs. Some of the punishments that the horrible characters have are based on puns: loud-mouthed Dolores from \"Silence is Golden\" is taken to an alchemist and is turned into a gold statue; \"Kiss and Make Up\" was a double meaning title about a girl who used make up to look prettier so that she could have her first kiss with a handsome boy in her school. Other titles are pop-culture references (\"Fatal Attraction\", \"The Big Sleep\", \"The Barber of Civil\", \"Monty's Python\", etc.).", "The franchise received a positive reaction from critics, and audiences of many ages. The second cartoon programme frequently appeared on audience-rated \"favourite programme\" lists on Nickelodeon. A reporter for The Sunday Times noted \"I played all five [audiobook adaptations] to my own junior jury aged 12, 7 and 5. They sat spellbound for 75 minutes, a rare event.\" Books for Your Children predicted that the series would be entertaining for everyone: \"An excellent book of stories for all but the most timid ... the accumulation of grimness is also part of the effect, so older children can enjoy this collection by themselves and adults can have a marvellous time reading them to younger ones\", whereas The Evening Standard encouraged it: \"It may be a children's story, but many a modern-day trendy parent could watch and learn.\" The School Librarian added: \"Jamie Rix tells us that bad ghosts always stay that way but bad children can improve, which is reassuring because his stories are full of unpleasant children.\"", "Category:Works by Jamie Rix"]}, {"page": "Ivan Jones (author)", "response": ["* The War Diaries of Alistair Fury by Jamie Rix"]}, {"page": "The Revenge Files of Alistair Fury", "response": ["The Revenge Files of Alistair Fury is the name of a series of children's books, written by Jamie Rix, and of the TV series based on the books.
