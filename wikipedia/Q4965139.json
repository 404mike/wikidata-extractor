Coventry played the Cosmos on 16 May 1979 in a friendly game arranged as part of Hunt's transfer. Having struggled to adapt back to the physical English game in the 1978\u201379 season, he established himself in the \"Sky Blues\" starting eleven for the 1979\u201380 campaign, playing as a left-sided midfielder rather than a pure winger. He formed a good understanding with Brian Roberts, who had succeeded Bobby McDonald at left-back. The Coventry team were young and inexperienced as established stars were sold off by chairman Jimmy Hill to fund the development of the club's training ground, the Sky Blue Connexion. Coventry also reached the League Cup semi-finals in 1981, where they were beaten by West Ham United. The young Coventry team had come from two goals down to win the first leg 3\u20132 at Highfield Road, but would lose the return fixture 2\u20130."]}, {"page": "Brian Roberts", "response": ["Brian Roberts may refer to:", "*Brian Roberts (Australian rules footballer) (1945\u20132016), Australian rules footballer", "*Brian Roberts (English footballer) (born 1955), English football defender", "*Brian Roberts (New Zealand footballer) (born 1967), New Zealand international footballer", "*Brian Roberts (baseball) (born 1977), American baseball player", "*Brian Roberts (soccer) (born 1982), American soccer player", "*Brian Roberts (basketball) (born 1985), American basketball player", "*Brian Roberts (historian) (born 1930), British historian on South African history", "*Brian Robertson (disambiguation)"]}]}}
