He has been credited with establishing the discipline of mathematical statistics. He founded the world's first university statistics department at University College, London in 1911, and contributed significantly to the field of biometrics and meteorology. Pearson was also a proponent of social Darwinism, eugenics and scientific racism. Pearson was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and biographer of Sir Francis Galton. He edited and completed both William Kingdon Clifford's Common Sense of the Exact Sciences (1885) and Isaac Todhunter's History of the Theory of Elasticity, Vol. 1 (1886\u20131893) and Vol. 2 (1893), following their deaths.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antimatter", "response": ["The idea of negative matter appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned.

Genetics studies, since its beginning, used statistical concepts to understand observed experimental results. Some genetics scientists even contributed with statistical advances with the development of methods and tools. Gregor Mendel started the genetics studies investigating genetics segregation patterns in families of peas and used statistics to explain the collected data. In the early 1900s, after the rediscovery of Mendel's Mendelian inheritance work, there were gaps in understanding between genetics and evolutionary Darwinism. Francis Galton tried to expand Mendel's discoveries with human data and proposed a different model with fractions of the heredity coming from each ancestral composing an infinite series. He called this the theory of \"Law of Ancestral Heredity\". His ideas were strongly disagreed by William Bateson, who followed Mendel's conclusions, that genetic inheritance were exclusively from the parents, half from each of them. This led to a vigorous debate between the biometricians, who supported Galton's ideas, as Walter Weldon, Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire and Karl Pearson, and Mendelians, who supported Bateson's (and Mendel's) ideas, such as Charles Davenport and Wilhelm Johannsen. Later, biometricians could not reproduce Galton conclusions in different experiments, and Mendel's ideas prevailed. By the 1930s, models built on statistical reasoning had helped to resolve these differences and to produce the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis.", "thumb|Example of a histogram.|350x350pxThe histogram (or frequency distribution) is a graphical representation of a dataset tabulated and divided into uniform or non-uniform classes. It was first introduced by Karl Pearson."]}, {"page": "Eugenics", "response": ["Early eugenicists were mostly concerned with factors of perceived intelligence that often correlated strongly with social class. These included Karl Pearson and Walter Weldon, who worked on this at the University College London. In his lecture \"Darwinism, Medical Progress and Eugenics\", Pearson claimed that everything concerning eugenics fell into the field of medicine."]}, {"page": "Gregor Mendel", "response": ["Mendel's results were quickly replicated, and genetic linkage quickly worked out. Biologists flocked to the theory; even though it was not yet applicable to many phenomena, it sought to give a genotypic understanding of heredity which they felt was lacking in previous studies of heredity, which had focused on phenotypic approaches. Most prominent of these previous approaches was the biometric school of Karl Pearson and W. F. R. Weldon, which was based heavily on statistical studies of phenotype variation. The strongest opposition to this school came from William Bateson, who perhaps did the most in the early days of publicising the benefits of Mendel's theory (the word \"genetics\", and much of the discipline's other terminology, originated with Bateson). This debate between the biometricians and the Mendelians was extremely vigorous in the first two decades of the 20th century, with the biometricians claiming statistical and mathematical rigor, whereas the Mendelians claimed a better understanding of biology. Modern genetics shows that Mendelian heredity is in fact an inherently biological process, though not all genes of Mendel's experiments are yet understood."]}, {"page": "Histogram", "response": ["A histogram is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data. It was first introduced by Karl Pearson.  To construct a histogram, the first step is to \"bin\" (or \"bucket\") the range of values\u2014that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals\u2014and then count how many values fall into each interval.  The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent and are often (but not required to be) of equal size."]}, {"page": "History of medicine", "response": ["By the late 19th and early 20th century English statisticians led by Francis Galton, Karl Pearson and Ronald Fisher developed the mathematical tools such as correlations and hypothesis tests that made possible much more sophisticated analysis of statistical data."]}, {"page": "Idealism", "response": ["Idealist notions took a strong hold among physicists of the early 20th century confronted with the paradoxes of quantum physics and the theory of relativity. In The Grammar of Science, Preface to the 2nd Edition, 1900, Karl Pearson wrote, \"There are many signs that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude materialism of the older physicists.\" This book influenced Einstein's regard for the importance of the observer in scientific measurements. In \u00a7 5 of that book, Pearson asserted that \"...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind...\" Also, \"...the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.\""]}, {"page": "Kurtosis", "response": ["The standard measure of a distribution's kurtosis, originating with Karl Pearson, is a scaled version of the fourth moment of the distribution. This number is related to the tails of the distribution, not its peak; hence, the sometimes-seen characterization of kurtosis as \"peakedness\" is incorrect. For this measure, higher kurtosis corresponds to greater extremity of deviations (or outliers), and not the configuration of data near the mean."]}, {"page": "List of agnostics", "response": ["* Karl Pearson (1857\u20131936): English mathematician who has been credited for establishing the discipline of mathematical statistics.", "* Walter Frank Raphael Weldon (1860\u20131906): English evolutionary biologist and a founder of biometry.

Drower expressing the view that it was her work on this subject which \"perhaps more than any other, made her known to the general public\". It has been claimed that Murray's was the \"first feminist study of the witch trials\", as well as being the first to have actually \"empowered the witches\" by giving the (largely female) accused both free will and a voice distinct from that of their interrogators. The theory was faulty, in part because all of her academic training was in Egyptology, with no background knowledge in European history, but also because she exhibited a \"tendency to generalize wildly on the basis of very slender evidence\". Oates and Wood, however, noted that Murray's interpretations of the evidence fitted within wider perspectives on the past that existed at the time, stating that \"Murray was far from isolated in her method of reading ancient ritual origins into later myths\". In particular, her approach was influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Frazer, who had argued for the existence of a pervasive dying-and-resurrecting god myth, and she was also influenced by the interpretative approaches of E. O.
