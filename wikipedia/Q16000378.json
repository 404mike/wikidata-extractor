He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who played for Surrey from 1903 to 1921. In all first-class matches, he took 954 wickets at an average of 20.58. In his final season, he took all ten wickets for 43 runs in the Somerset first innings at Taunton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Crawford (cricketer)", "response": ["Crawford's performances in the 1909 season were less effective than in previous years. He began well, but was later hampered by an injury which prevented him from bowling.Hart, p. 21. His batting average also fell. Surrey experienced disciplinary problems with several of their professional players during the season. The club president, Lord Alverstone, favoured amateurs, arguing that a losing amateur team was preferable to a professional side that won; several professionals were left out in favour of amateurs.McKinstry, p. 97. Apart from adversely affecting some players' careers, this preference had destabilised the team over several seasons.McKinstry, p. 48. Crawford disagreed with Alverstone, but nevertheless frequently assumed the leadership in the absence of the regular captain Leveson Gower for much of the season. He captained Surrey to a win over the touring Australian team early in 1909 after a strong performance by the professional bowler Tom Rushby. However, his captaincy was strongly criticised in the press, particularly over his management of the bowling.Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1328. Around this time, Crawford's form declined. With the bat, he was often dismissed attempting aggressive shots, and he lost his effectiveness as a bowler. As a result, he was not chosen for the Gentlemen and missed selection in the Ashes series. The press continued to criticise his captaincy, despite Surrey's good results under his leadership. Burns notes: \"For a young man with no experience of prolonged failure on the cricket field, this was almost certainly a traumatic time.\"Burns, Chapter 7, Location 1366."]}, {"page": "Thomas Rushby", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Rushby"]}, {"page": "Sam Groth", "response": ["| Andrew Kennaugh   Tom Rushby"]}, {"page": "Andrew Coelho", "response": ["| Andrew Kennaugh   Tom Rushby"]}, {"page": "Chris Eaton (tennis)", "response": ["| Edward Corrie   Tom Rushby"]}, {"page": "Martin Fischer (tennis)", "response": ["| Josh Goodall   Tom Rushby"]}, {"page": "Rushby", "response": ["*Tom Rushby (1880\u20131962), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1911 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 123 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 21.83 || Tom Rushby || Surrey"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Surrey had a strong team in the 1920s but then fell away, after Jack Hobbs retired, to be a mid-table one through most of the 1930s. Besides Hobbs (known as \"The Master\"), noted batsmen were Andy Ducat, Andy Sandham, Tom Barling, Errol Holmes, Laurie Fishlock, Bob Gregory, Tom Shepherd and Stan Squires. Surrey's best bowlers were Bill Hitch, Alf Gover and Percy Fender. They could also call upon Maurice Allom, Alan Peach, Tom Rushby and Eddie Watts. Behind the stumps, Surrey were well served by Herbert Strudwick and Ted Brooks."]}]}}
