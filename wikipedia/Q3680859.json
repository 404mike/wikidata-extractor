Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.", "Archaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs.McCluskey 2005 It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as \"a field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other\".Carlson 1999", "The term archaeoastronomy was advanced by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (following the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973,Sinclair 2006:17 but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive RugglesRuggles 2005:312\u201313 says that Heinrich Nissen, working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf SinclairSinclair 2006:8 says that Norman Lockyer, working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy'. Euan MacKieMackie 2006:243 would place the origin even later, stating: \"...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of Alexander Thom in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s\".", "In the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer Gerald Hawkins, who proposed that Stonehenge was a Neolithic computer,Hawkins 1976 inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed,Atkinson 1966 but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of megalithic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles.Thom 1988:9\u201310 Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate winter solstice site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon stone circle in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.MacKie 1977 In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.Gingerich 2000 Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, Edwin C. KruppKrupp 1979:18 wrote in 1979, \"Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.\" His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.Hicks 1993Iwaniszewski 1995", "In contrast Clive Ruggles has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys.Ruggles 1999:19\u201329Ruggles and Barclay 2000: 69\u201370 Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon.Schaefer and Liller 1990 A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: \"To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn\u2019t inform the current interpretive questions.\"Kintigh 1992 Nonetheless, the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.Hoskin 2001", "Clive Ruggles and Michel Cotte recently edited a book on heritage sites of astronomy and archaeoastronomy which discussed a worldwide sample of astronomical and archaeoastronomical sites and provided criteria for the classification of archaeoastronomical sites.Clive Ruggles and Michel Cotte (ed.), Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy.

He considered that archaeoastronomy should be regarded as an aspect of anthropology which helps us in studying ancient people's ways of thinking.
