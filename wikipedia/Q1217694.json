In 1940, the British numismatist Harold Mattingly dated the 1937 coin, based on its style, to  249/250. Most later authors have agreed with this approximate mid-3rd century date, and he is most often placed as a usurper in the turbulent reign of Philip the Arab. Craven suggests 248 as the most likely year, placing a revolt by Silbannacus shortly prior to the uprisings of the subsequent usurpers Sponsian, Pacatian and Jotapian. Though it is the most common suggestion, the coin being from the time of Philip is an educated guess, and far from certain. Some historians place Silbannacus in the reign of Philip's successor Decius (249\u2013251) instead, and others place him as directly preceding Postumus (260\u2013269), who founded the breakaway Gallic Empire, an idea first proposed by the French historian J.
