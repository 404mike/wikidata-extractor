He lived there most of his life, however for much of the time he led an itinerant existence travelling throughout Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia pursuing and executing design commissions throughout the region. He was influenced by the Richardsonian Romanesque architectural style (for his domestic buildings) and Victorian gothic (for his church designs). \nHis greatest disappointment was the loss of a commission late in life to design the Anglican Cathedral in Halifax (1905-1910). The commission was awarded to New York City architect Bertram Goodhue and Harris was given the unhappy task of overseeing completion of the more famous architect's work. \nHis brother was the noted artist Robert Harris.", "link_mentions": {}}}
