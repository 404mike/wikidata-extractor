In 1993, construction workers installing streetlights unearthed human bones near Beria's Moscow villa. Skulls, pelvises and leg bones were found. In 1998, the skeletal remains of five young women were discovered during work carried out on the water-pipes in the garden of the same villa (now the Tunisian Embassy). Each had been shot through the base of the skull and had likely been naked when buried due to the lack of articles found on the bodies. Medical examiners estimated that the remains had been placed alongside the conduit at the time it was laid, in the summer of 1949. In 2011, building workers digging a ditch in Moscow city centre unearthed a common grave near the same residence, containing a pile of human bones, including two children's skulls covered with lime or chlorine. The lack of articles and the condition of the remains indicate that these bodies were also buried naked in this same time period. According to Martin Sixsmith, in a BBC documentary, \"Beria spent his nights having teenagers abducted from the streets and brought here for him to rape. Those who resisted were strangled and buried in his wife's rose garden.\" Vladimir Zharov, Head of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Moscow\u2019s State University of Medicine and Dentistry and then the head of the criminal forensics bureau, said a torture chamber existed in the basement of Beria's Moscow home and that there probably was an underground passage to burial sites."]}, {"page": "Spin", "response": ["* Spin, a 2004 novel by Martin Sixsmith "]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay", "response": ["| The book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by Martin Sixsmith"]}, {"page": "Civil Service (United Kingdom)", "response": ["In 2000, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair was criticised for appointing 20 special advisers (compared to eight under his predecessor John Major) and for the fact that the total salary cost of special advisers across all government departments had reached \u00a34 million.The advisers: Modernisation or politicisation?, BBC News, 12 January 2000 In 2001, Stephen Byers, then Secretary of State for Transport, was forced to resign because of the actions of his special adviser Jo Moore, who instructed a departmental civil servant, Martin Sixsmith, that September 11, 2001, would be \"a good day to bury bad news\"; this was seen as inappropriate political manipulation of the Civil Service.Spin doctor role under spotlight, BBC News, 5 January 2004 In particular, under the administration of Tony Blair, the influence of two Downing Street special advisers, Jonathan Powell and Alastair Campbell, both of whom were given formal power over Downing Street civil servants, provoked widespread criticism.Uncivil to the servants , The Scotsman, 26 February 2002"]}, {"page": "American imperialism", "response": ["In the First World War, the US, Britain, and Russia had been allies for seven months, from April 1917 until the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November. Active distrust surfaced immediately, as even before the October Revolution British officers had been involved in the Kornilov Affair, an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by the Russian Army against the Provisional Government. Nonetheless, once the Bolsheviks took Moscow, the British government began talks to try and keep them in the war effort. British diplomat Bruce Lockhart cultivated a relationship with several Soviet officials, including Leon Trotsky, and the latter approved the initial Allied military mission to secure the Eastern Front, which was collapsing in the revolutionary upheaval. Ultimately, Soviet head of state V.I. Lenin decided the Bolsheviks would settle peacefully with the Central Powers at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. This separate peace led to Allied disdain for the Soviets, since it left the Western Allies to fight Germany without a strong Eastern partner. The Secret Intelligence Service, supported by US diplomat Dewitt C. Poole, sponsored an attempted coup in Moscow involving Bruce Lockhart and Sidney Reilly, which involved an attempted assassination of Lenin. The Bolsheviks proceeded to shut down the British and U.S. embassies.Martin Sixsmith, \"Fanny Kaplan's Attempt to Kill Lenin\" in Was Revolution Inevitable?: Turning Points of the Russian Revolution, edited by Tony Brenton (Oxford University Press, 2017 ), pp. 185\u2013192"]}, {"page": "Stephen Byers", "response": ["In late 2001, it was revealed that Byers' political adviser, Jo Moore, had sent an email on 11 September 2001, suggesting that the September 11, 2001 attacks made it \"a very good day to get out anything we want to bury\". Moore and Byers survived the resulting outrage, but, in February 2002, the public uproar broke out again.

On 15 February, the resignations of both Moore and Sixsmith were announced. Later on, however, Sixsmith stated that he had not agreed to go, but rather that Byers had insisted on the head of news' departure as his price to pay for losing Moore.

It highlights the struggles and conflicts between politicians, party spin doctors, advisers, civil servants and the media. In similar fashion to Yes Minister, the political parties involved are never mentioned by name, and in series 1 and 2 most policies discussed are fairly generic and non-ideological.  Beginning with the Christmas specials in which shadow DOSAC secretary Peter Mannion and his team are introduced, although still not named, the context makes clear that the government party is Labour and Mannion's party is the Conservatives.  This continues through series 3 and series 4 when the real life government coalition between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems is reflected in the show. Iannucci describes it as \"Yes Minister meets Larry Sanders\". Journalist and former civil servant Martin Sixsmith was an adviser to the writing team, adding to the realism of some scenes.
