States like Texas have a bona fide and appropriately named state police department such as the Texas Department of Public Safety, of which only one arm is a highway patrol division. In addition, the police departments of Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Nassau and Suffolk counties in New York have highway patrol bureaus. These units have special uniforms for their highway duty- service caps with the wire grommet removed, giving the classic \"crusher\" look, leather jackets, riding breeches, riding boots, Sam Browne-style belts and lanyards for their service pistols.  A privately compiled list of Highway Patrol organizations and similar state police agencies is available on the web.  The Iowa State Patrol maintains a list of phone numbers and cell phone dialing codes for non-emergency calls to the dispatchers of the Highway Patrol organizations in all 50 states.  These numbers are useful for motorists who want to report aggressive driving, driving under the influence, or other dangerous but not life-threatening situations that do not require a 9-1-1 call."]}, {"page": "Ryde", "response": ["*Sam Browne (1824\u20131901), the soldier after whom the belt was named, lived the last years of his life in a house called Argosy in East Hill Road."]}, {"page": "Sam Browne belt", "response": ["The Sam Browne belt is a wide belt, usually leather, supported by a narrower strap passing diagonally over the right shoulder (although Royal Canadian Mounted Police non-commissioned members wear theirs over the left shoulder).

Currently it is mainly used by high-ranking officers during parades and other ceremonies, as it is only worn with dress uniform M58 and service uniform M83; while most Army and Air Force personnel, excluding cadets studying in the National Defence College as well as soldiers on ceremonial duties, use the camouflage uniform M05 as their service uniform, and the use of the \"command belt\" with any camouflage uniform except M62 (already phased out of service) is strictly forbidden.", "The Sam Browne belt featured prominently in many uniforms used by the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany, again in imitation of earlier European uniforms. It was popular with Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazi officials.", "The Irish Citizen Army, Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Army (IRA) made extensive use of Sam Browne belts during the Irish revolutionary period (1916\u201323).

They were later used by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the National Army.", "After World War II the Sam Browne belt saw a decline in use in the Commonwealth. It was dropped from the standard officer's uniform in 1943 and replaced by the cloth 1937 pattern and 1944 Pattern webbing gear. However, officers and warrant officers class 1 of the British Army and Royal Marines still wear it in service (No.2) dress and in non-ceremonial versions of No.1 dress.Paragraph 20, Dress Regulations for the Mercian Regiment, January 2009", "In Australia, all officers and warrant officers class 1 are entitled to wear the belt in ceremonial dress.

However, the Army as a whole did not immediately approve its use. MPs were positioned at stateside docks and confiscated them from returning officers.  The United States Army mandated the Sam Browne belt for overseas soldiers in 1918 under the name \"Liberty belt\" and for all service members in 1921, this time under the internationally accepted name \"Sam Browne belt\".  It was a standard part of the uniform between World War I and World War II. It was limited in use in 1940 when the Army abandoned sabers and replaced with a cloth waistbelt that was sewn to the officer's jacket.", "During World War I the Marine Corps adopted a brown leather Sam Browne Belt.

The belts led to the slang terms Harness Bull or Harness Cop for a uniformed police officer. The utility belts worn today by American police usually lack the cross-strap and the attachments for them.

This use has gradually faded out due to field safety concerns. It is part of the ceremonial dress uniform of many agencies, most notably the Red Serge worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  The RCMP enlisted ranks wear the cross belt over the left shoulder to support the pistol worn on the right side. Enlisted members who are left handed wear the cross strap over the right shoulder to support the pistol worn on the left side.  RCMP commissioned officers wear the cross strap over the right shoulder due to the need to support a sword when wearing the red serge ceremonial uniform. This difference of wearing the cross strap over different shoulders for commissioned and non-commissioned members is even maintained when wearing the stripped Sam Browne belt (no pistol or sword).", "The Sam Browne belt has been proposed as a solution to occupational safety and health concerns about injury due to the weight of equipment on police officers' belts.  However, others have expressed concern that the vertical design of the belt could enable criminals to gain physical control of law enforcement officers in an altercation.", "During the interwar period, the belt became fashionable among some American and European women. Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady of the United States at the time, openly spoke out against the practice.
