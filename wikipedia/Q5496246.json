He began his football career with Annesley Colliery and also played for Darlaston before turning professional with Birmingham in October 1932. Shaw made his debut in the First Division on 29 January 1934 in a 3\u20131 defeat at Blackburn Rovers. A mobile, lightweight inside forward, Shaw did not fit into Birmingham's style of play, and enjoyed greater success when he moved to Notts County. Put straight into the starting eleven for the Second Division match at home to Swansea Town, Shaw repaid his manager with a hat-trick, becoming only the second player in Notts County history to achieve the feat on his debut. After scoring 21 goals in 56 league games in two-and-a-half seasons, Shaw spent a season with Mansfield Town and another with Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic before returning to his native Nottinghamshire on the outbreak of the Second World War.", "link_mentions": {}}}
