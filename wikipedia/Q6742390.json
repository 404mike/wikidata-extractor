In 1961 she became the youngest member of the Constructionist group, centred on Victor Pasmore and including Adrian Heath, John Ernest, Anthony Hill, Kenneth Martin, and Mary Martin. In the 1960s her work became much more widely shown with exhibitions in London (at the Drian and Axiom galleries, the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Victoria and Albert Museum), in Chicago, and at the 1965 Tokyo Biennale and the 1969 Nuremberg Biennale.  In 1968, she gained a UNESCO Fellowship award to study in Prague, followed in 1969 by a British Council scholarship to study Russian constructivism in Leningrad. In Leningrad she met and married an architect, Adrian Ciobotaru.  In the same year she exhibited with a group of British artists in an exhibition of systems-based abstraction in Finland, followed in 1970 by her joining many of the same artists in the newly formed Systems Group and quitting the Constructionist group.  Her fellow artists in that group included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Malcolm Hughes, Jean Spencer, Michael Kidner, John Ernest, and David Saunders. She exhibited with the group in Matrix at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol in 1970, and then in 1972, at the Whitechapel Gallery in the Arts Council's Systems exhibition.  The Arts Council also commissioned her to curate the Constructivist section of the 1978 Hayward Annual, followed in the same year by her inclusion in the Arts Council's Constructive Context show."]}, {"page": "Jeffrey Steele (artist)", "response": ["Steele was a founder member of the Systems group of artists along with Malcolm Hughes (1920\u20131997) in December 1969. The group included Michael Kidner, Gillian Wise (1936\u2013), Peter Lowe (1938\u2013), Colin Jones (1934\u2013), David Saunders (1936\u2013), Jean Spencer (1942\u20131998), Richard Allen (1933\u201399), John Ernest (1922\u20131994) and others. The group arose through an exhibition of nine artists, \"Systeemi-System\", organised by Steele and his then wife, the textile designer Arja Nenonen (1936\u20132011), at the Amos Anderson Museum in Helsinki, capital of Nenonen's native Finland, in 1969. The exhibition was subtitled by Steele \"An Exhibition of Syntactic Art from Britain\", the word \"syntactic\" referring to the work \"being constructed from a vocabulary of largely geometric forms in accordance with pre-determined and often mathematically-based systems\". The Helsinki show was followed by a similar one called \"Matrix\" at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol and the 1972/3 Arts Council touring exhibition \"Systems\" which opened at the Whitechapel Gallery in London in March 1972. This was followed by \"Systems II\" at the Polytechnic of Central London in 1973. Individual members showed at the Lucy Milton gallery in Notting Hill, London, up to 1975, and in continental Europe during the 1970s and afterwards. The group ceased to exist in 1976 following political disagreements, but a number of its members remained on friendly terms and exhibited together.Fowler, \"Constructive and Systems Art in Britain after the Second World War\", in the catalogue for \"Elements of Abstraction: Space Space, Line & Interval in Modern British Art\", at Southampton City Art Gallery, September 2005."]}, {"page": "Ernest Edmonds", "response": ["The show included works by Harold Cohen, Anthony Hill, Malcolm Hughes, Michael Kidner, William Latham, Kenneth Martin, Mary Martin, Jeffrey Steele, Sean Clark and Susan Tebby."]}, {"page": "Natalie Dower", "response": ["Natalie Dower trained first at St Martins, transferring to Camberwell after a year, and moving to the Slade in 1949. Here, the emphasis was on figurative drawing, and Dower's early works are in the figurative tradition. Nearly a decade later, while teaching at Corsham, she developed an interest in Constructivism, as was being taught by her colleague Malcolm Hughes, and she began to develop her interest in making work according to mathematical rules based on proportion, number and rhythm. Excited by the emphasis on logic and rationality in this discipline, she embarked on the true path of her career."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 1997", "response": ["*Malcolm Hughes, 77, British artist."]}, {"page": "Jean Spencer (artist)", "response": ["Spencer was born in Frimley in Surrey and studied teacher training at the Bath Academy of Art from 1960 to 1963. While still a student at Bath she created her first abstract reliefs, having been introduced to systematic constructivism by her tutors John Ernest and Malcolm Hughes. For a time, Spencer taught at the Loughborough College of Art before moving to the Bulmershe College of Higher Education in Reading where she was a staff member for twenty years until 1988 when she joined the faculty of the Slade School of Fine Art in central London, where she remained for ten years in different posts.", "As an artist, Spencer had her first solo exhibition at the Bear Lane Gallery in Oxford in 1965 and a second exhibition, at the University of Sussex, followed in 1969. During the 1960s, Spencer often produced cubes in relief form, with proportions based on a mixture of mathematical rules and her own intuition. Later in life she focussed on painting and the use of bold blocks of colour. In 1967 Spencer was a prize winner at the annual John Moores exhibition in Liverpool. Spencer exhibited with a group of British artists concerned with systems-based abstraction, the Systems Group, that included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Michael Kidner as well as Malcolm Hughes. Her work was shown widely in Europe between 1969 and 1973 as part of various Systems Group exhibitions. In Britain, her work was included in the 1972 Arts Council touring exhibition of Systems Group artworks. During 1977 and 1978, Spencer produced a series of publications, Working Information, featuring drawings and designs by Systems Group and other Systematic-Constructive artists. She then spent a year at the University of Sussex studying the History and Theory of Art for her M.A. Spencer was an active member of the group behind the Exhibiting Space series of multi-disciplinary collaborations held in Whitechapel in 1983 and was included in the 1986 exhibition Colour Presentations at the Gardner Centre Gallery at the University of Sussex, which then toured Britain.", "Spencer lived in London and for twenty-five years was the partner of her former Bath tutor and Systems Group artist, Malcolm Hughes who she married in 1997, shortly before he died. They worked on a number of projects together including a 1990s exhibition and symposium, Testing the System held at Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, where, subsequently, Spencer was an artist-fellow at Churchill College. The Tate held a joint memorial exhibition for Spencer and Hughes in 1999. Works by Spencer, both paintings and sculptures, are held in several public collections, most notably at the Tate, in the collections of the Arts Council, Reading Museum and of the University of Warwick."]}]}}
