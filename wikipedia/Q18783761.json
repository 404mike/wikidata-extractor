A renowned letter-writer even in his own lifetime, most of his extensive correspondence has since been lost. His home is sometimes referred to as Oughtertyre or (more erroneously) Auchtertyre.

A later legendFamily Romance; Or Episodes in the Domestic Annals of The Aristocracy. Bernard Burke (1853) suggests a canny deal between Dundas and the Earl of Hopetoun. \"John Dundas owned a property called Stang Hill Tower which was on the edge of the Earl of Hopetoun's estate. For many years the Earl tried to obtain the tower from John Dundas to add to his estate, but John Dundas refused all offers to let it go, despite the threat of law suits and even bribery. Finally on his death bed he told his son \"It is foolish forever to struggle against our rich and powerful neighbour. He will, sooner or later, have our little property; make the best terms with him you can\". Soon after John Dundas' death, an exchange highly advantageous to the Dundas' of Manour was effected. Stang Hill Tower being given to Lord Hopetoun and the estate of Aithrey which belonged to Lord Hopetoun being made over to Ralph Dundas\" (1675\u20131729). In 1747 John Dundas of Manour (1701\u20131780) (grandson of the John Dundas in the legend) rebuilt Airthrey House for himself and his family (including his son General Ralph Dundas, 1730\u20131814). His niece's husband, the writer John Ramsay of Ochtertyre (1736\u20131814), later described the house he built as \"a small snug house\" and says that \"conscious of his ignorance of country affairs\", John Dundas \"contented himself while there with making a kitchen-garden, and having a few acres in grass, without any corn, or adding to his father\u2019s small enclosures.

The location of the house was described by the diarist John Ramsay of Ochtertyre as being \"upon the top of a moor without a tree\". The house passed to Alexander's son Robert (1718\u20131785), who became a Lord of Session under the title Lord Kennet. Around 1758 he sold Brucefield House to George Abercromby of Tullibody, whose daughter he had married in 1754.

Bernard Burke A visitation of the seats and arms of the noblemen and gentlemen of Great Britain (Volume 2) online   Paterson's father had married without the consent of his father, Sir John Paterson, 2nd Baronet but was given an annual allowance. When John Paterson (younger) died in 1743 Sir John took the surviving sons into his care and replaced the allowance with smaller individual allowances to the wife and daughters. When Paterson succeeded his grandfather in the baronetcy on 14 December 1759 he took one of the sisters under his care and increased the allowance to his mother slightly. His mother and sisters took a case to court demanding larger allowances from Paterson. The court concluded that he should provide for his mother, but not for his sisters. He married  Lady Anne Hume Campbell, daughter of Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont  on 23 October 1755. He was country landowner who cared well for his estates.  Within the vicinity of Eccles there is a large stone monument on the site of a dreadful battle between the Percy and Douglas families, which Paterson wanted to move close to his mansion, but  the stone was too deep-set to move. He did however pay for the removal of the old manse and offices from close to his house to the site of the rebuilt church  It seems however an exaggeration on the basis of these accounts to conclude that Paterson's chief interests were embellishing his house and investigating local antiquities.  Another account, probably by John Ramsay of Ochtertyre described Paterson as \u201cnot a popular character\u201d and notorious for his gambling, ruthlessness and dissolute life."]}, {"page": "Walter Young (minister)", "response": ["He was a friend of John Ramsay of Ochtertyre and Rev Patrick MacDonald of Kilmore, and worked on song collecting together.
