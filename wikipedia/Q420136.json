Amongst the indigenous peoples of India, Malaysia, Polynesia, North Africa, North America, and South America, the worship of these stones, or the use of these stones to symbolize a spirit or deity, is a possibility.Goblet, et al.

Nor is it believed any longer that there was a pan-European megalithic culture, although regional cultures existed, even within such small areas as the British Isles.  The archaeologist Euan Mackie wrote, \"Likewise it cannot be doubted that important regional cultures existed in the Neolithic period and can be defined by different kinds of stone circles and local pottery styles (Ruggles & Barclay 2000: figure 1). No-one has ever been rash enough to claim a nationwide unity of all aspects of Neolithic archaeology!\".Mackoe, Euan W, \"The structure and skills of British Neolithic Society: a brief response to Clive Ruggles & Gordon Barclay.

In several of his works, Smith argued that Europe was the cradle of humanity, identifying a European Mediterranean race as the occupants of the original home of modern humans. His cradle was large, as he claimed the Mediterranean race had occupied the Levant, Egypt and western Europe, including the British Isles. He especially linked the Mediterranean race to the civilization of Egypt. Smith's arguments later became known as his theory of diffusionism. According to Smith and William James Perry, Egypt was the source of all cultural innovations and the ultimate source of human civilization.", "At first, Smith remained vague on the reasons for the spread of Egyptian influence to places without mineral deposits like Polynesia. However, in 1915 William James Perry, a professor of comparative religion at the University of Manchester, advanced the view that the \"megalith-builders\" were looking for pearls and precious stones, which Smith adopted as well."]}, {"page": "Trans-cultural diffusion", "response": ["The work of Grafton Elliot Smith fomented a revival of hyperdiffusionism in 1911; he asserted that copper\u2013producing knowledge spread from Egypt to the rest of the world along with megalithic culture.The Routledge Dictionary of Anthropologists, G\u00e9rald Gaillard, 2004, p. 48 Smith claimed that all major inventions had been made by the ancient Egyptians and were carried to the rest of the world by migrants and voyagers.
