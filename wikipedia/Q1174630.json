These decisions resulted in almost immediate backlash as both roles are traditionally portrayed by white actors and historically depicted as white. Tim Whitmarsh, a professor of Greek culture at the University of Cambridge, defended the production, arguing that historical Greeks were \"unlikely to be uniformly pale-skinned\", that \"dark-skinned North Africans existed\" in ancient Greece, citing Memnon of Ethiopia as an example. Whitemarsh also stated the question of whether \u2018black people\u2019 lived in Ancient Greece is itself flawed as the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of \"race\". He added that \"Our best estimate is that the Greeks would be a spectrum of hair colours and skin types in antiquity. I don't think there's any reason to doubt they were Mediterranean in skin type (lighter than some and darker than other Europeans), with a fair amount of inter-mixing.\" and that there is no single, absolutely definitive version of the Trojan War story: \"Homer's poems are merely one version and the Greeks themselves understood the story could change... There's never been an authentic retelling of the Iliad and the Odyssey \u2013 they've always been fluid texts. They're not designed to be set in stone and it's not blasphemous to change them.\"", "In an 8 April review for IndieWire, Steve Greene criticized the show for telling the same story that has been told thousands of times before and offering very little innovation. He concludes: \"The result is a series more competent than compelling. The tiny diversions from the norm seem thrilling by comparison\".
