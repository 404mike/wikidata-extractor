Although naive Bayesian filters did not become popular until later, multiple programs were released in 1998 to address the growing problem of unwanted email.  The first scholarly publication on Bayesian spam filtering was by Sahami et al. in 1998. That work was soon thereafter deployed in commercial spam filters. However, in 2002 Paul Graham greatly decreased the false positive rate, so that it could be used on its own as a single spam filter.Paul Graham (2003), Better Bayesian filtering Brian Livingston (2002), Paul Graham provides stunning answer to spam e-mails ", "This is the formula referenced by Paul Graham in his August 2002 article.

A spammer practicing Bayesian poisoning will send out emails with large amounts of legitimate text (gathered from legitimate news or literary sources). Spammer tactics include insertion of random innocuous words that are not normally associated with spam, thereby decreasing the email's spam score, making it more likely to slip past a Bayesian spam filter. However, with (for example) Paul Graham's scheme only the most significant probabilities are used, so that padding the text out with non-spam-related words does not affect the detection probability significantly.", "Words that normally appear in large quantities in spam may also be transformed by spammers. For example, \u00abViagra\u00bb would be replaced with \u00abViaagra\u00bb or \u00abV!agra\u00bb in the spam message. The recipient of the message can still read the changed words, but each of these words is met more rarely by the Bayesian filter, which hinders its learning process. As a general rule, this spamming technique does not work very well, because the derived words end up recognized by the filter just like the normal ones.Paul Graham (2002), A Plan for Spam "]}, {"page": "Greenspun's tenth rule", "response": ["Paul Graham also highlights the satiric nature of the concept, albeit based on real issues: "]}, {"page": "H.
