Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers to fax or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement.

June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would \"like to play my own age for a change\".

Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special two-hander episode aired in November 1998, featuring only Pat and Peggy for the entire duration.

The episode, written by Tony Jordan, featured what the Sunday Mirror described as one of \"the most vicious fights ever filmed by a soap\",  with both throwing glasses at one another and Pat slapping Peggy across the face exclaiming \"You bitch!\" and Peggy responding by slapping Pat exclaiming \"You cow!\".
