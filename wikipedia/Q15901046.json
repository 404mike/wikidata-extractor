Sugg began posting videos to her YouTube channel in 2009, which went on to amass over 10 million subscribers. In 2014, she launched Zoella Beauty, a brand of beauty products that was described as the \"biggest beauty launch of the year\". Sugg later launched a range of complementary homeware products, and in 2019, it was reported that the two businesses had revenue of \u00a33.8 million per year.\nIn 2014, Sugg signed a three-book deal with Penguin Books, and her debut novel, Girl Online, was published in November 2014, breaking the record for highest first-week sales of a first-time novelist. She has since released a non-fiction book, Cordially Invited, and is currently writing a series of books alongside co-author Amy McCulloch, titled The Magpie Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Viral marketing", "response": ["In 2014, A.L.S. Ice Bucket Challenge was among the best viral marketing challenges examples in the social network. Millions of people on the social media started filming themselves, pouring a bucket of ice water over their heads and sharing the video with their friends. The challenge was created to give support for fighting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also called Lou Gehrig's disease. People finished the challenge and then nominated the next person they knew on the social media to take the same challenge. By following this trend, Ice Bucket Challenge became a 'fab' on social media with many online celebrities such as Tyler Oakley, Zoe Sugg and huge celebrities and entrepreneurs like Justin Bieber, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates participating. Until September 2014, over 2.4 million ice bucket-related videos had been posted on Facebook, and 28 million people had uploaded, commented on or liked ice bucket-related posts. And about 3.7 million videos had been uploaded on Instagram with the hashtags #ALSicebucketchallenge and #icebucketchallenge. The ALS association didn't invent the ice bucket challenge, but they received a huge amount of donation from this activity. It raised a reported $220 million worldwide for A.L.S. organisations, and this amount is thirteen times as much donation as what it had in the whole preceding year in just eight weeks."]}, {"page": "Do They Know It's Christmas?", "response": ["*Zoe Sugg"]}, {"page": "List of young adult writers", "response": ["*Zoe Sugg: Girl Online"]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["* Zoe Sugg, YouTuber lives in Brighton"]}, {"page": "Brighton in fiction", "response": ["* Zoe Sugg"]}, {"page": "Maisie Williams", "response": ["Williams (in collaboration with a designer from Daisie), along with Zoe Sugg and activist Adwoa Aboah, designed a limited-edition period bag for WaterAid's non profit monthly subscription service Fempowered.

Williams said she wanted to help girls feel \"period proud\" and to \"make life fairer for girls everywhere\". Sales of the bags are intended to help both tackle taboos regarding periods (65 per cent of UK women say they feel too uncomfortable to openly carry their period products to the toilet in public), while also raising money to tackle international inequalities of period poverty, where one in four people globally lack access to hygienic sanitation, safe private spaces and aids to help manage their periods hygienically, which results in many girls around the world missing or abandoning school."]}, {"page": "List of YouTubers", "response": ["| British South African vlogger, popular for his interviews with other YouTube personalities such as Zoe Sugg.", "| British internet personality, brother of Zoe Sugg and known for his challenges, impersonations and comedy videos."]}, {"page": "Zoe (name)", "response": ["*Zoe Sugg (born 1990), English beauty blogger & vlogger"]}, {"page": "The Corsham School", "response": ["*Zoe Sugg, YouTuber and author"]}, {"page": "2003 in British television", "response": ["*26 July - ITV1 debuts late night entertainment series PointlessBlog fronted by Alfie Deyes, Zoe Sugg & Marcus Butler.
