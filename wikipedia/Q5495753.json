He qualified at Doncaster Plant works as a coppersmith working on such legendary engines as The Silver Link, The Flying Scotsman and The Mallard. As war loomed this would become reserved occupation so Kenneth was never enlisted. Kenneth played football for the plant team and after one of the games was approached by Mr. Mark Crook offering the opportunity to become a professional footballer. He joined Wath Wanderers and spent time at the nursery club before playing for the parent club Wolverhampton Wanderers in wartime football 1944\u201346.
