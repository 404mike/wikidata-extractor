Some bolters seized boats and set sail for foreign lands, but most were hunted down and brought back to Australia. Others attempted to inspire an overhaul of the convict system, or simply sought revenge on their captors. This latter desire found expression in the convict ballad \"Jim Jones at Botany Bay\", in which Jones, the narrator, plans to join bushranger Jack Donahue and \"gun the floggers down\"."]}, {"page": "Southcote, Berkshire", "response": ["In 1860 the occupant was Louisa Mundy, widow of Lieutenant Governor of Jersey Godfrey Mundy.

He supported the accessibility of gold found on private land, but was accused of giving preference to his brother and also, erroneously, of appropriating funds. A Legislative Council select committee found him \"of a character wholly incompatible\" with holding his office in 1852 and he was forced into retirement. He published a pamphlet on goldfield issues in 1855, and in 1857 was a founding member of the Yass Mechanics' Institute.

Having been promoted to the ranks of major and lieutenant colonel prior to 1858, he was promoted to the rank of brevet colonel in April 1858. He was promoted to the full rank of colonel in July 1864.
