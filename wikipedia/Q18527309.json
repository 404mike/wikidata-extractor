The chancel was rebuilt in 1830. The tower was probably erected in the 14th century and now supports a recessed spire that was erected in 1859\u201360 to the designs of William Slater. The spire appears to have been left as a stump by the medieval builders but in the 18th century was provided with an unusual climax in the form of a large copper ball mounted on a king post and four supports and topped by a weather vane. According to John Mastin, a vicar and historian of Naseby, the ball was loot brought to England in 1544 by Sir Gyles Allington and ultimately found its way to Naseby.", "The monumental inscriptions inside the church and in its graveyard, including its extension, have been transcribed and published.
