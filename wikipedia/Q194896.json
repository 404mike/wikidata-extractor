Jagger received a three-month prison sentence for the possession of four amphetamine tablets; Richards was found guilty of allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property and sentenced to a year in prison. Both Jagger and Richards were imprisoned at that point but were released on bail the next day pending appeal.

It began with the sound of prison doors closing, and the accompanying music video included allusions to the trial of Oscar Wilde.
