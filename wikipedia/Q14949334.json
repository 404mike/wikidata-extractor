He was raised in Bradford and then took a degree in Industrial Metallurgy at Birmingham University (1968\u201371) where he began reading and publishing his poetry. Staying on in Moseley, Birmingham, until 1977, he founded his poetry magazine The Little Word Machine, had several books and pamphlets published by small presses, co-founded Moseley Community Arts Festival, and toured with his music and poetry troupe, The Stereo Graffiti Show. Moving back to Bradford in 1977, he co-founded the seminal music fanzine The Wool City Rocker and formed the band Ulterior Motives, in which he was lyricist and lead vocalist. Continuing to tour as a poet and to publish his writings, he also recorded songs with a variety of bands. During the early 1980s, he ran a series of weekly punk and indie gigs. Throughout the late '80s and early '90s, he ran weekly alternative cabaret clubs, usually co-organising these with fellow performer Wild Willi Beckett. Since the mid-'90s, his collections of children's poetry (first with Macmillan and later with Hodder, LDA, Caboodle, etc.) have seen him become a best-selling children's writer. Also, since 1997, he has been regularly collaborating with the composer Malcolm Singer, starting with their Dragons Cantata. By 2011, Toczek had worked as a visiting writer in thousands of schools, visiting dozens of countries worldwide in the course of this work. He is also a professional close-up magician, a skilled puppeteer, an authority on far-right neo-Nazi and racist groups, a prolific print journalist and an experienced broadcaster.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Nick Toczek (born 1950, E)"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Nick Toczek (born 1950), English writer, poet and broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Shipley, West Yorkshire", "response": ["* Poet and writer Nick Toczek"]}, {"page": "List of performance poets", "response": ["*Nick Toczek"]}, {"page": "Nick", "response": ["*Nick Toczek (born 1950), British writer"]}, {"page": "The Britons", "response": ["They also published anti-Semitic books including a translation, allegedly by Victor E. Marsden, of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. It has been observed that Marsden had died on 28 October 1920; the Britons ceased publication of the first imprint which Norman Cohn states came out in 1921. However, the earliest imprint bearing the name of Marsden held by the British Library is dated 1922 and whose online catalogue shows that it was imprinted by the Britons Publishing Society. No scholarly work exists on Marsden, a one-time correspondent for The Morning Post, and there has not yet been an accounting of how precisely his name came to be associated with the publication of The Protocols. In August 1921, the text was conclusively exposed by Philip Graves of The Times as plagiarism. The translation used was made by George Shanks for Eyre & Spottiswoode. Researcher Nick Toczek claims that for the sum of \u00a330, The Britons purchased a set of printing plates and the publishing rights to The Jewish Peril: The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion from that company. The Britons continued to publish and sell The Protocols for the rest of their existence, eventually producing 85 editions.
