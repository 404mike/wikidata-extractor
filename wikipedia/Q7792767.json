In addition, there are many other historic buildings, including The George Inn, where the manorial court of Dodmore once sat. At The George Inn there is still the Courtroom Bar, the room in which the court baron of the manor was held. The present lord of the manor of Dodmore owns the Tudor manor house. The family of the cricketer Thomas Nordish worked Dodmore Manor Farm. In the late 20th century Ifield CC relocated to within Dodmore's ancient manorial boundaries, becoming New Ifield CC."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|Thomas Nordish"]}, {"page": "Nordish, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Nordish"]}]}}
