Born in Shipley Hall, Derbyshire, the son of politician Edward Miller Mundy, George Mundy joined the Navy at a young age and served in several of the principal actions of the French Revolutionary Wars. He subsequently held a succession of frigate commands during the Napoleonic Wars and was active in the blockade of the French coast and in assisting Spanish irregular forces during the Peninsular War. After the war Mundy remained in service and in 1830 was captain of the royal yacht Royal George. He was knighted in 1837 and continued to rise through the ranks, eventually becoming a full admiral in 1849.", "link_mentions": {}}}
