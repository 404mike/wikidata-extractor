Born in Shipley Hall, Derbyshire, the son of politician Edward Miller Mundy, George Mundy joined the Navy at a young age and served in several of the principal actions of the French Revolutionary Wars. He subsequently held a succession of frigate commands during the Napoleonic Wars and was active in the blockade of the French coast and in assisting Spanish irregular forces during the Peninsular War. After the war Mundy remained in service and in 1830 was captain of the royal yacht Royal George. He was knighted in 1837 and continued to rise through the ranks, eventually becoming a full admiral in 1849.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boroughbridge (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| George Mundy||Tory", "|Captain George Mundy, RNSpooner and Lawson were initially declared re-elected at the 1820 general election, but they were unseated and Mundy and Dawkins were returned on petition||Tory", ":At the 1826 United Kingdom general election, George Mundy and Henry Dawkins were elected unopposed."]}, {"page": "HMS Hydra (1797)", "response": ["Under the command of Captain George Mundy, for eight years from October 1802 to September 1810, she had an active career in the Napoleonic Wars, including the Blockade of Cadiz (1805-1806).", "After Admiral Lord Nelson defeated the Franco-Spanish fleet at the battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, four French frigates and the brig Furet took refuge at Cadiz, where they remained into February 1806. To try to lure them out, Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood pulled his ships-of-the-line ten leagues out to sea, leaving only Hydra, under Captain George Mundy, and the brig-sloop  in close blockade. On 23 February a strong easterly wind drove the British off their station, which led the French commander, Captain Louis-Charles-Auguste Delamarre de Lamellerie, to seize the opportunity to escape. On the evening of 26 February Hydra and Moselle were three leagues west of the Cadiz lighthouse when they sighted the French vessels. Mundy began firing rockets and alarm guns to alert Collingwood, while sailing parallel to the escaping French squadron. Mundy then sent Carden in Moselle to try to locate the British fleet. On the morning of 27 February Moselle reached Collingwood, who despatched three frigates to try to catch the French."]}, {"page": "Edward Miller Mundy (1750\u20131822)", "response": ["* George Mundy (1777\u20131861), who was an officer of the British Royal Navy."]}, {"page": "Lamellerie's expedition", "response": ["Lamellerie's squadron was spotted late on 26 February by lookouts on Hydra and Captain George Mundy, supported by Captain John Surman Carden on Moselle, steered a parallel course in the hope of cutting off their advance. At 23:00, Carden was detached to look for Collingwood and inform him of the location and direction of the French while Mundy continued to follow the enemy squadron. Although Hydra was now isolated and hopelessly outnumbered, Lamellerie made no effort to attack the British ship: he even failed to respond when the brig Furet, falling behind the larger and faster frigates, came within range of Hydra.James, p. 214 Mundy opened fire at 04:30, Lieutenant Dumay on Furet acknowledging that he was hopelessly outgunned and completely unsupported by immediately striking his colours.Clowes, p. 198  As Collingwood's squadron was nowhere within sight and the French were rapidly pulling ahead, Mundy abandoned the chase, secured his prize and turned back eastwards as the French continued into the Atlantic. It is not known why Lamellerie fled from such an inferior force and allowed one of his ships to be captured without opposition: modern historian Richard Woodman describes his conduct as \"astonishing, given the weakness of the opposition and [the strength of his] own combined force\", but in a separate work suggests that Lamellerie's orders precluded any engagement until his force was safely off the coast.Woodman, p. 219"]}, {"page": "HMS Carysfort (1766)", "response": ["Carysfort sailed again on 26 January 1802 on an anti-smuggling patrol and returned on 26 February.
