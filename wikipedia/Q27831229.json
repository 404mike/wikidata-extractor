In 1838, he patented the 'Bethell process' for preserving timber using creosote. That same year he was elected an Associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was the younger brother of Richard, the Lord Chancellor Lord Westbury and like his brother a son-in-law of the architect Robert Abraham,  having married Abraham's daughter Louisa Sarah on 28 February 1833.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Creosote", "response": ["The use of coal-tar creosote on a commercial scale began in 1838, when a patent covering the use of creosote oil to treat timber was taken out by inventor John Bethell. The \"Bethell process\"\u2014or as it later became known, the full-cell process\u2014involves placing wood to be treated in a sealed chamber and applying a vacuum to remove air and moisture from wood \"cells\". The wood is then pressure-treated to impregnate it with creosote or other preservative chemicals, after which vacuum is reapplied to separate the excess treatment chemicals from the timber. Alongside the zinc chloride-based \"Burnett process\", use of creosoted wood prepared by the Bethell process became a principal way of preserving railway timbers (most notably railway sleepers) to increase the lifespan of the timbers, and avoiding having to regularly replace them."]}, {"page": "Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury", "response": ["Born at Bradford on Avon, in Wiltshire, he was the eldest son of the physician Richard Bethell of Bristol and Jane (n\u00e9e Baverstock).
