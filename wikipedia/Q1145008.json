He escaped twice, the first time within a day of his capture, and was held in solitary confinement in ever more brutal conditions as a result of his unbreakable defiance. His final period of punishment was for wearing a rosette to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. He was eventually released, in a prisoner exchange, on 10 August 1953.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derek Godfrey Kinne", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek Kinne"]}]}}
