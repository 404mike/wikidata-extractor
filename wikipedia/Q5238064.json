He is a former lecturer at Salford University.Based in Manchester, Nolan is known for investigating and proving/disproving myths in popular music. He tracked down the audience for the famous 1976 gig by the Sex Pistols at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall, and discovered the reasons for the secrecy surrounding the family history of New Order frontman Bernard Sumner. He also incurred the wrath of Morrissey by turning him into a cartoon character for the Granada Television documentary These Things Take Time in 2002, after the former The Smiths singer refused to appear in the programme.In 2008, he produced the Salford Music Map for Salford City Council, showing many of the city's music landmarks and artists, including Bernard Sumner, Ewan MacColl and Tim Burgess of the Charlatans.\nHis biography of Tony Wilson was published in 2009. In it he revealed details of the late music entrepreneur's early years, his careers in music and television, his personal relationships as well his battle with the NHS for the cancer drug Sutent. The book was written with the co-operation of Wilson's partner.\nAfter writing books on Ed Sheeran and Emeli Sand\u00e9, his biography of Nottingham singer Jake Bugg was published in 2014.

The hour-long programme is an elaborate pastiche of the film Woodstock and is largely presented in split-screen. It follows the efforts of festival organisers as they attempted a Glastonbury for the north, while the British musical landscape was changing from progressive rock to punk. It was narrated by Bob Harris, former presenter of The Old Grey Whistle Test, and has since been released on DVD in a much extended form as the 3 hours plus the Deeply Vale Festivals DVD."]}, {"page": "Emeli Sand\u00e9", "response": ["Emeli had become involved in the Urban Scot collective who helped and encouraged her career by promoting her in Scotland, and \u2013 according to Emeli Sand\u00e9: The Biography by David Nolan (2013)David Nolan, \"Emeli Sande \u2013 The Biography\" at Amazon. \u2013 also released an album of songs called Have You Heard? on Glasgow's Souljawn Records, which was sold at gigs.
