The Daily Express said that Eton \"may well have elected a man who will help to effect a quiet, but most necessary revolution\" at the school. As quoted in Peel, 1996, p.142 The Eton Chronicle, authored mostly by pupils, was more blunt about the expected upheavals of the times, writing about the new headmaster that, \"The whole problem of privilege, and the question of integration with the state system of education will inevitably become a political issue arousing vehemence and bigotry\". As quoted in Peel, 1996, p.149 As late as the final term of 1965 Chenevix-Trench, interviewed in the same publication, publicly expressed a preference for entry solely by competitive examination rather than by birth and background, and the same year he was still assuring pupils that school uniform was to be abolished entirely. The Chronicle was again a factor in the debate over abolishing boxing; David Jessel and William Waldegrave wrote a piece against it in February 1964, and the Daily Express featured it on its front page. Not all these demands seemed important or realistic to following generations, who also wondered how significant it was whether \"to listen to high thoughts and to be at peace in school for ten minutes every day\", in chapel, should be optional or not. The BBC reported in 1967 that Chenevix-Trench had \"considerably softened\" the rigorous rules on chapel attendance. Nevertheless, Private Eye duly ran an article in 1969 arguing that Chenevix-Trench had clearly lost his way, since neither school uniform, nor boxing, nor compulsory Chapel, had been entirely abolished."]}, {"page": "List of former BBC newsreaders and journalists", "response": ["* David Jessel \u2013 joined the BBC in 1967 as a trainee reporter for BBC Birmingham.
