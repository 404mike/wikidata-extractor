He formerly spent time as manager and coach at Scottish Women's Premier League clubs Monklands Ladies,  Glasgow City FC and Celtic Women. \nFollowing spells coaching in boys football and the men's amateur game, he accepted an offer from Monklands Ladies to become Manager and guided them in his first season to the 1997/98 Scottish 1st Division West title, with a 100% win record, and into the Scottish Women's Premier League for the first time. After a single year in charge in the Premier League, where he consolidated their position, he left after an approach from Glasgow City, who themselves had just been promoted to the Premier League, stating he felt Monklands Ladies were unable to match his ambitions.    \nCaulfield joined Celtic in February 2011  following his surprise departure from Glasgow City where he spent 11 years in charge, winning five Scottish Women's Premier League titles, three Scottish Cups and two Premier League cups. He was appointed manager at Celtic in January 2013 following two years spent as assistant manager to Robert Docherty.\nHe resigned from Celtic on 25 July 2013, only five months into his first season in charge of the team.
