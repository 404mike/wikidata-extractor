A former professional cyclist who specialised in time trials and hilly races, she later transferred to endurance running, duathlon and triathlon, and is currently a professional triathlete and duathlete, and the reigning quadruple world champion in long-distance duathlon.\nShe won an Olympic silver medal in the time trial in 2008 and was world time trial champion in 2010. She has won six UCI Women's Road World Cup one-day races, as well as several stage races including the ten-day Tour de l'Aude. She is three-times a British time trial champion and in 2010 also won the British road race championships.\nPooley retired from professional cycling after the 2014 Commonwealth Games to concentrate on triathlon, duathlon and long-distance running, having won the Lausanne Marathon and the Swissman triathlon the previous year. She went on to win the ITU Powerman Duathlon World Championships at Powerman Zofingen in September 2014 and again in 2015. On 16 December 2015, Pooley announced that she would be returning temporarily to cycling, seeking to qualify to represent Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, as she felt the unusually mountainous time trial course on offer played to her strengths.In June 2016, Pooley came out of retirement and re-signed for her former team, Lotto\u2013Soudal Ladies, in time for the 2016 Giro Rosa. After racing in the Olympic time trial and road race she returned to duathlon with two further world championship titles at ITU Powerman Duathlon World Championships at Powerman Zofingen in September 2016 and 2017 as well as a European middle-distance duathlon title in 2017.\nBetween February 2018 and March 2019 Pooley worked at Global Cycling Network as a presenter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trinity Hall, Cambridge", "response": ["File:Pooley PodiumF Ventouxman 2017.jpg|Emma Pooley, Olympic silver-medallist cyclist and presenter", "* Emma Pooley \u2013 Olympic silver medalist"]}, {"page": "University Challenge", "response": ["|Trinity Hall, Cambridge (Tom James, Emma Pooley, Adam Mars-Jones, Dan Starkey)"]}, {"page": "Duathlon", "response": ["*Emma Pooley - 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 ITU LD World Champion, 2017 European MD Champion"]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Emma Pooley (Trinity Hall), Olympic silver medal (2008), world time trial champion (2010)"]}, {"page": "Sport in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Success at road racing was also limited, with the United Kingdom being the only major nation not to have a Tour de France champion, until Bradley Wiggins' victory in the 2012 Tour de France.

Until 1998, it was the Tour Cycliste F\u00e9minin, but the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Tour de France, organizers of the men's Tour de France, said that infringed their trademark and in 1999 the name was changed.  It resumed under the name Grande Boucle F\u00e9minine Internationale, but was not held in 2004 because of organisational difficulties. It returned, smaller, in 2005. The previous tours were 10 to 15 stages; later ones had five and stayed in one region. The race also received a lower classification by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), and had a reduced field. In 2008, the race was six days and seven stages. However, in 2009 the race was only four days long with only 66 riders, after a planned race start and three stages in Britain fell through, leading winner Emma Pooley to joke that the race was \"more of a Petite Boucle than Grande.\"  The race was discontinued after 2009."]}, {"page": "Giro d'Italia Femminile", "response": ["|Emma Pooley", "|Emma Pooley (2)", "|Emma Pooley (3)"]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Emma Pooley"]}, {"page": "Adam Mars-Jones", "response": ["On 2 January 2015, Mars-Jones was captain of the winning team on Christmas University Challenge, representing Trinity Hall, Cambridge, who defeated Balliol College, Oxford, the University of Edinburgh and the University of Hull.
