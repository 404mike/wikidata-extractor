The gym's manager and Anna's son, Gary Windass (Mikey North), appears and forces Lauren to leave. During a meeting at school, Lauren and Bethany are suspended after Lauren tricks their headmaster into thinking that Bethany is bullying her. Lauren later harasses Bethany at her great-grandmother Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) salon, but Bethany's uncle David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) offers to bury the hatchet by giving Lauren a free haircut. After sending Bethany out to get coffee, David cuts off Lauren's hair and threatens to cut her throat if she hurts Bethany again, causing Lauren to flee the salon. Lauren later calls the police on David, but he lies that Lauren changed her mind on her haircut halfway through, with his story being backed up by Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell). Lauren is later expelled from school after several other girls in Bethany's year group come forward and admit that Lauren has been terrorising them as well. Lauren's father Phil (James Doherty) later beats up David for hacking off Lauren's hair."]}]}}
