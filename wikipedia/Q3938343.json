In February, a consortium headed by former NBA player Matt Walsh became the majority shareholders via a newly formed company called Breakers Basketball Ltd, thus ending the 13-year Liz and Paul Blackwell ownership team. Next came the exodus of four of the franchise's most long-serving figures during the off-season: Alex Pledger and Mika Vukona departed for Melbourne and Brisbane respectively, Kirk Penney retired, and Paul Henare's 15 years as player and coach came to an end. In a total remake of their big man contingent, the Breakers also parted ways with Robert Loe. To coincide with the appointment of new head coach Kevin Braswell, the Breakers reacquired the services of Tai Wesley, a Guam-qualified American on the final year of his status as an unrestricted player. Braswell also lured back Tall Blacks star Corey Webster, and signed Jarrad Weeks and Majok Majok. The Breakers started the season with a 4\u20138 record following a five-game losing streak in late November and early December. As the season continued, Webster presented as a shadow of the figure who was once a premier scorer in the league, Abercrombie and Ili struggled with scoring, and Patrick Richard failed to live up to expectations. By mid-January, the Breakers had an 8\u201312 record following three consecutive losses, including losing to the last-placed Cairns Taipans. They went on to miss the finals with a sixth-place finish and a 12\u201316 record.", "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020\u201321 season start date was delayed until January 2021. As a result of the pandemic, the Breakers were forced to commit to being based in Australia for the majority of the season. They hosted a number of games as the 'home' team in Tasmania and only returned to play their last seven games in New Zealand in late May. A number of players missed large portions of the season due to injury and personal issues, including Robert Loe (20 games), Thomas Abercrombie (9), Corey Webster (8) and Tai Webster (7). The team also had a mid-season import change, with Lamar Patterson being replaced by Levi Randolph. They finished the season in eighth place with a 12\u201324 record."]}, {"page": "1991 in New Zealand", "response": ["** Robert Loe, basketball player"]}, {"page": "K.A.O.D.
