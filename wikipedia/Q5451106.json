She is best known for her series of interviews throughout the 1980s in The Face magazine. For a brief period in the mid-1980s, she performed as a member of pop group ABC in videos and onstage to support their cartoon-synth album How to Be a ... Zillionaire! (1985).  She was credited originally as \"Fiona\" in early recordings of material for this album, but eventually performed under the stage name \"Eden\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eden", "response": ["* Fiona Russell Powell, stage name Eden, member of the 1980s pop group ABC"]}, {"page": "ABC (band)", "response": ["Singleton left the band shortly after the release of Beauty Stab as a result of Fry and White's reluctance to spend much time touring the band's material. Fry and White then enlisted the services of Fiona Russell Powell (under the name \"Eden\") and David Yarritu in the band's new line-up. Russell Powell had been a member of the original line-up of the pre-ABC band, Vice Versa. According to an article s published on 7 March 1997,\"Pop groups should not make comebacks, says Fiona Russell Powell\" , The Times, 7 March 1997 she 'chickened out' of Vice Versa's first live gig, and the job as frontman went to Fry. The Fry-White-Russell Powell-Yarritu line-up recorded the album How to Be a ... Zillionaire!, released in 1985. The band's chart success dwindled further in the UK with this album, but they did score their first US Top 10 hit with \"Be Near Me\", which also made the UK Top 30. The album also featured the singles \"(How to Be a) Millionaire\", \"Vanity Kills\" and \"Ocean Blue\". Inspiration for the album's cartoons of the band members was taken from a photo shoot by David Levine whose work featured on many of the sleeves for singles released from this album.
