He was sold on to Port Vale for a \u00a36,000 fee in July 1986, before returning to Walsall on a free transfer January 1988. Helping the \"Saddlers\" to win promotion via the play-offs, he moved on to Grimsby Town, before retiring due to injury the following year.\nAfter retiring due to injury in 1989 he took up coaching and has served as the assistant manager at Hereford United, Bournemouth, and Doncaster Rovers. He became a manager for the first time with Hereford United in March 2012, but quit the post two months later after the \"Bulls\" were relegated out of the Football League.

A young Robbie Earle began to show his promise, though it was veteran Alistair Brown who was the season's top scorer, with 21 strikes. A mid-table finish was acceptable considering the rebuilding effort Rudge made with the squad. In May 1985, young Welshman Andy Jones was purchased from Rhyl for \u00a33,000. He was soon joined by \u00a312,000 defender John Williams and numerous others. Vale were promoted back to the third tier in 1985\u201386, finishing in fourth place, losing just once at Vale Park. During the season, they went on an eighteen-match unbeaten run, building their record largely on a solid defence. Jones and Earle scored eighteen and seventeen goals respectively. The only downside was the finances, as a loss of \u00a379,474 was recorded, partly due to promotion bonus payouts. In the summer of 1986, new signings included Ipswich Town's reserve goalkeeper Mark Grew on a free, Aston Villa midfielder Ray Walker for \u00a312,000, Sheffield United winger Paul Smith for \u00a310,000 and Walsall striker Richard O'Kelly for \u00a36,000. Rudge also turned down the management position at Preston North End. He also made an attempt to bring a young Steve Bull to Vale Park. After an unconvincing start to 1986\u201387, Rudge sold John Williams to Bournemouth for \u00a330,000 and brought in Bob Hazell from Reading on a free. This helped transform the club's defence, while Andy Jones' fantastic record of 37 goals helped win the Vale a twelfth-place finish.
