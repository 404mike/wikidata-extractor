A diminutive and defensive right-handed batsman, he played mostly as an opener, and was a regular member of the Somerset side between 1961 and 1964. He scored 1,000 runs in three seasons from 1961 to 1963, reaching 1552 runs at an average of 26.30 in 1962. He made four first-class centuries, with the highest being 128 in the match against Essex at Brentwood in 1962. He was awarded his county cap in 1962.In 1964, despite an unbeaten century against Lancashire at Bath, Roe was out of form and he was dropped from the side in July. He played a few matches in both 1965 and 1966 without regaining his form, and with competition for batting places high at Somerset with the return of Roy Virgin as an opener after National Service and the rise of Mervyn Kitchen, he left first-class cricket at the end of the 1966 season.\nRoe moved to Minor Counties cricket with Devon and made one List A appearance for a Minor Counties South representative side against Somerset in 1973 in the Benson and Hedges Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Brian Roe (1957\u20131966) 131 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Graham Atkinson (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1964, though, Atkinson was part of a general and sudden decline in Somerset's batting. He was less affected than his previous opening partner, Brian Roe, and also less than Somerset's leading run-scorer of the past 10 years, Peter Wight, both of whom lost their places in the team through lack of form. But Atkinson's own aggregate dipped to 1207 runs for the season and his average to just 26; he failed to score a century. He was always an unspectacular accumulator of runs rather than a quick scorer, but Wisden noted that he \"looked only a shadow of his former self because he became so constricted in his style\"."]}, {"page": "Chris Greetham", "response": ["Greetham was one of several Somerset batsmen for whom the 1964 season saw a regression. Unlike Peter Wight and Brian Roe, who suffered similar declines, he retained his place for most matches, but his aggregate of runs dropped by more than half to just 504, there was only one score of more than 50, and his average fell too to just 15. His bowling offered no consolation, and his wickets fell to just 17 and the average rose to more than 40 runs per wicket."]}, {"page": "Geoff Lomax", "response": ["Lomax returned to the Somerset side as a regular player in 1961, but his role as opening batsman had been taken in his absence by Brian Roe, so Lomax batted in the middle order. He made 938 runs at an average of 19.14 and took 36 wickets at 33.97; there were no centuries and no five-wicket innings. The batting record in 1962 was similar, with 865 runs at an average of 24.02. There was, though, finally a second century to add to the one he had scored in 1954 \u2013 an unbeaten 104 in the match against Sussex at Eastbourne, which was the highest innings of Lomax's career. By contrast, Lomax's bowling in 1962 was negligible: just nine wickets all season at a high cost. Towards the end of the 1962 season, Lomax was left out of the side for some matches and he retired from first-class cricket at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Roe (surname)", "response": ["* Brian Roe (1939\u20132014), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 28 June \u2013 Brian Roe, 75, cricketer (Somerset)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2014", "response": ["*Brian Roe, 75, British cricketer (Somerset).Somerset and Devon cricketer Brian Roe dies, aged 75 "]}, {"page": "Roe, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Roe"]}, {"page": "List of Minor Counties South List A players", "response": ["*Brian Roe (1973): B Roe"]}]}}
