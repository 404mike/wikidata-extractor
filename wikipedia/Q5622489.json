His career was cut short by injury in November 1978 when he collapsed on the field in Barnsley's away match with York City. He was taken to hospital where initial tests indicated kidney damage. It was announced a few days later that the first diagnosis was wrong and he had suffered a (minor) stroke. Brian was forced to retire from professional football although he did make some appearances later in non-league football, most notably for Frickley Athletic and Matlock Town. Barnsley organised a testimonial match against a combined Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United side to mark the end of his career with Mick Channon and David Speedie taking part amongst other stars. It was also revealed during the Championship live on BBC Two between Nottingham Forest and Cardiff City on 5 April 2010 that Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy used to clean Joicey's boots during their time at Barnsley together, a humorous revelation that made BBC commentator Guy Mowbray laugh and vaguely reminisce, after Mowbray commented that Cardiff City captain Jay Bothroyd used to clean Chelsea defender Ashley Cole's boots during Bothroyd's time as a trainee at Arsenal."]}, {"page": "The Premiership (TV programme)", "response": ["In order to cut back on the department's resources, ITV decided to send four of its commentators, Clive Tyldesley, Jon Champion, Peter Drury and Guy Mowbray, to the high profiled matches of the weekend.
