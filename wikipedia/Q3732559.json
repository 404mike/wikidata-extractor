Against the Turks and Caicos Islands, he took the wicket of Errion Charles, finishing with figures of 2/10 from four overs. He wasn't required to bat in Montserrat's nine wicket victory. Against Nevis, he bowled two expensive overs which conceded 30 runs without a wicket. In Montserrat's unsuccessful chase of 185, he top scored with 35, before being run out by Akito Willett. In 2010, he played one club match in England for North Middlesex Cricket Club."]}, {"page": "2013 ICC Americas Twenty20 Division Two", "response": ["*Errion Charles"]}]}}
