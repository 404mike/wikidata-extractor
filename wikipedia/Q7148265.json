Woodcock suggested that Brittin was England's only remaining hope. Patsy Lovell was trapped leg before wicket for four runs, while Suzie Kitson remained one not out at the end of the innings. Brittin had made England's highest score, 46 not out. Woodcock said that: \"It was a pity, really, that Brittin had not got in before the 27th over, with the touch she has.\" England scored 127 runs, a total The Sydney Morning Herald said \"was never going to be enough\". Throughout their 60-over innings, England scored two boundaries. In humid conditions, they especially struggled against spin bowling; Fullston took three wickets and allowed 29 runs, while Larsen took two wickets for 22. The wet outfield also slowed scoring; this dried as the match went on, giving Australia the better of the batting conditions. In the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Carol Salmon estimated that the slow outfield cost England between 20 and 30 runs.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Patsy Lovell", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Patsy Lovell "]}]}}
