(1915\u20131972) was a British cinematographer. He succeeded Jack Asher as regular Director of Photography for Hammer Film Productions. His films for Hammer included Shadow of the Cat (1961), The Curse of the Werewolf (1961), The Phantom of the Opera (1962), The Plague of the Zombies (1966) and The Devil Rides Out (1968). His final film for the studio was Demons of the Mind in 1972.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dracula Has Risen from the Grave", "response": ["The film was photographed by Arthur Grant using colored filters belonging to director Freddie Francis, also a cameraman, who used them when photographing The Innocents (1961). Whenever Dracula (or his castle) is in a scene, the frame edges are tinged crimson, amber and yellow. Initially Terence Fisher was to direct the film, but dropped out due to illness; Freddie Francis stepped in."]}, {"page": "Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed", "response": ["Variety called the film \"a good-enough example of its low-key type, with artwork rather better than usual (less obvious backcloths, etc.) a minimum of artless dialogue, good lensing by Arthur Grant and a solid all round cast.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \"the most spirited Hammer horror in some time. The crudities still remain, of course, but the talk of transplants and drugs seem to have injected new life into the continuing story of Baron Frankenstein.\""]}, {"page": "Jack Asher", "response": ["His style was characterized by a fantastical use of colours, such as non-realistic purples and greens. Director Terence Fisher said of him, \"Jack Asher had a very distinctive style of lighting, which was quite different from Arthur Grant's...(Who) had a more realistic approach to the situation. Jack Asher's was almost theatrical lighting with little tricks, like color slides placed over the lights and so on.\""]}, {"page": "The Abominable Snowman (film)", "response": ["The Abominable Snowman was the only film to be produced for Hammer by Aubrey Baring, who was a member of the Barings banking family. Shooting began with a ten-day second unit location shoot at La Mongie in the French Pyrenees between 14 and 24 January 1957. Guest and Baring led a crew that included cinematographer Arthur Grant, camera operator Len Harris and focus puller Harry Oakes. Local trade union rules required that they were accompanied by a French crew. None of the principal performers were brought on location and doubles were used for the actors. Most of the filming was done in the vicinity of the observatory at the summit of Pic du Midi de Bigorre, reached by cable car from La Mongie. Although a helicopter was used for some of the panoramic shots of the mountains, many of them were shot from the cable car as it ascended the mountain. Cognisant of the conditions they would be working in, Harris used a Newman-Sinclair clockwork camera whereas the French crew used a conventional Mitchell BFC camera, which failed numerous times on account of the cold.", "The film was shot in an anamorphic wide screen format called Regalscope, renamed \"Hammerscope\" by the company. Val Guest found it an unsatisfactory format to work in, which made getting in close to the actors difficult and required careful framing of scenes. This was the first film Arthur Grant worked on for Hammer as cinematographer and his reputation for being fast and cheap meant he soon replaced Jack Asher as Hammer's regular cinematographer. Just as he had done with the Quatermass films, Guest tried to give the film \"an almost documentary approach of someone going on an expedition with a camera for Panorama or something\". To this effect, he made extensive use of hand-held camera and overlapping dialogue."]}, {"page": "Captain Clegg (film)", "response": ["Variety was moderately positive, writing that the film had a \"good\" screenplay and \"savvy\" direction, \"and the range of technical credits are all on the plus side, especially Arthur Grant's photography.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin was negative, writing, \"The script is feeble, the acting, apart from Patrick Allen's forceful hero, uninspired, and the obsession with injury, degradation and death more dispiriting than ever.\""]}, {"page": "The Shadow of the Cat", "response": ["The Shadow of the Cat is a 1961 British horror film directed by John Gilling for Hammer Film Productions. It stars Andr\u00e9 Morell and Barbara Shelley. It was photographed in black-and-white by Arthur Grant. It was released in May 1961 on a double feature bill with Curse of the Werewolf."]}, {"page": "Run a Crooked Mile", "response": ["Acclaimed for its original premise, stylish photography (by Arthur Grant) and use of exotic locations, the film has managed to develop a cult following. In 2018, the film was released on DVD by the German Label PIDAX."]}, {"page": "Danger List", "response": ["Danger List is a 1959 British short film directed by Leslie Arliss for Hammer Film Productions. It stars Philip Friend, Honor Blackman and Mervyn Johns. It was photographed by Arthur Grant, and has a score by Edwin Astley. The running time is 22 minutes."]}]}}
