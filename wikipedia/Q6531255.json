He was primarily an opening batsman and an occasional medium-paced bowler.\nWright played as a professional for Stourbridge Cricket Club before beginning his county career.\nHis first-class debut came in May 1925, when he scored 31 and 14 against Oxford University at The Parks.\nHe did not play again that season, but in 1926 he appeared on 26 occasions, and ended the summer with 873 first-class runs at an average of 18.97.\nThis tally included his maiden hundred, 111 against Hampshire (sharing an opening partnership of 185 with Maurice Jewell) in midsummer.\nHe also picked up the first of his 76 wickets when he removed Leicestershire's Les Berry and Alec Skelding in early June.From then until the end of his career in 1933, Wright was a regular sight in the Worcestershire team: in only two seasons (1931 and 1933) did he make fewer than 20 appearances. His most productive season was 1928, when he made 1,402 runs at 24.07, including 101 and 57 against Hampshire.\nHe also passed his thousand runs in 1930, when he hit 1,180: this was the only year in which he made two centuries, of which the higher (his career best) was 134 against Northamptonshire in July.\nHe narrowly missed out on the landmark in 1929, making 992 runs that year.After 1930 Wright never scored another hundred, and although his form recovered somewhat after a dreadful 1931 in which he averaged less than 10,\nin 92 innings in the last three years of his career the highest score was the 86 he struck against the touring Indians at Worcester in June 1932.\nHe did hit another six half-centuries that summer, and a further three in his final season of 1933. His last game, against Glamorgan in late August 1933, was an anticlimax: Wright was bowled by George Lavis for 3 in his only innings, and went wicketless from ten overs.Wright also played football as a centre-forward in the Worcester League. After retiring from cricket, he ran a remand home in Mitcham, Surrey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Spencer (cricketer, born 1901)", "response": ["It was nearly three years before Spencer played first-class cricket again, and when it happened it was for Warwickshire. He played three matches for the county, but only managed one wicket in total, when he bowled his former teammate and Worcestershire opener Leslie Wright in the first innings of his first match for Warwickshire. In two subsequent games for the county, he bowled 31 overs without taking a wicket, although he was generally tidy: in his short Warwickshire career he conceded only 146 runs from 66 overs."]}, {"page": "Edwin Walker (cricketer)", "response": ["Walker made a single first-class appearance for Leicestershire against Worcestershire in the 1930 County Championship at New Road, Worcester. Worcestershire batted first and made 222 all out, with Walker taking the wicket of Leslie Wright to finish the innings with figures of 1/21 from seventeen overs. Leicestershire were dismissed for just 58 in their response, with Walker dismissed for a single run by Reg Perks. Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, Leicestershire were dismissed for 152, with Walker ending the innings not out on 1. Leicestershire lost the match by an innings and 12 runs, while Walker never played for the county again."]}, {"page": "Leslie Wright", "response": ["Leslie Wright may refer to:", "* Leslie Wright (cricketer) (1903\u20131956), English cricketer", "* Leslie Wright (priest) (1899\u20131972), Anglican priest", "* Leslie Wright (pianist) (born 1938), Ecuadorian pianist"]}]}}
