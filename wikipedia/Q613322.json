After the takeover of the British Telegraph Company, the Magnetic acquired the rights to the needle telegraph instrument of that company's founder, Henry Highton.  This instrument was the cheapest of any of the instruments produced at the time, but like all needle telegraphs, was slower than audible systems due to the operator having to continually look up at the instrument while transcribing the message.  Some companies moved to needle instruments with endstops making two different sounds when the needle struck them (an innovation of Cooke and Wheatstone in 1845)Bowers, pp. 150\u2013151 to solve this problem.  The Magnetic instead used an 1854 invention of Charles Tilston Bright on its more busy lines.  This was the acoustic telegraph (not to be confused with the acoustic telegraphy method of multiplexing) known as Bright's bells.  In this system, two bells placed either side of the operator are rung with a hammer made to strike the bell by a solenoid driven by a relay.  They are so arranged that the right and left bells are struck according to whether a positive or negative pulse of current is received on the telegraph line.  Such bells make a much louder sound than the clicking of a needle.", "* Bright, Edward Brailsford; Bright, Charles, The Life Story of the Late Sir Charles Tilston Bright, Civil Engineer, Cambridge University Press, 2012  (first published 1898)."]}, {"page": "Electrical telegraphy in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The Magnetic used a telegraph system not covered by ETC's patentsMercer, p. 8\u2014William Thomas Henley and George Foster's needle telegraph, which did not require batteries.
