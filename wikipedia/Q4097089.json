The Benny Hill Show had a music hall-derived format combining live on-stage comedy and filmed segments, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included Patricia Hayes, Jeremy Hawk, Peter Vernon, Ronnie Brody and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, Dave Freeman. Short, bald Jackie Wright was a frequent supporting player who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head."]}, {"page": "1991 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8 || Ronnie Brody || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 72 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Hi-de-Hi!", "response": ["*Plumber (Series 6) (Ronnie Brody) \u2013 The plumber at Maplins, twice seen cleaning Fred and Mr Partridge's sink."]}, {"page": "Whoops Baghdad", "response": ["*Ronnie Brody as Mustafa Shufti, Wizard Prang's assistant (1 episode)"]}, {"page": "The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins", "response": ["* Ronnie Brody as Costermonger"]}, {"page": "Don't Lose Your Head", "response": ["*Ronnie Brody as Little man (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "High Finance (Dad's Army)", "response": ["*Ronnie Brody as Mr Swann"]}, {"page": "The Royal Train", "response": ["*Ronnie Brody as Bob"]}, {"page": "Friday Night, Saturday Morning", "response": ["| 26 October 1979 || Alan Brien || Russell Davies, Harold Evans, Sponooch, Jilly Cooper, Prof. Peter Townsend, Lord Melchett, Peter York, Lynda Hayes, Will Elsworth-Jones, and Jeremy Child, Norman Bird, Ronnie Brody in a sketch"]}, {"page": "List of The Goodies guest stars", "response": ["| Ronnie Brody ||||| \"Punky Business\" "]}, {"page": "List of Are You Being Served? characters", "response": ["* Ronnie Brody (\"Anything You Can Do\", as Signor Balli); also appeared in \"The Night Club\" (series 10)", "* Ronnie Brody (\"The Night Club\", as Man in Cinema); also appeared in \"Anything You Can Do\" (series 7)"]}, {"page": "List of Carry On films cast members", "response": ["* Ronnie Brody (2) made his first unaccredited appearance in Don't Lose Your Head, followed up by the small role of Henry in Loving.
