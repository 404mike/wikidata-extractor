However, due to a scheduling conflict, Chelsea crashed out of the FA Cup in the Third Qualifying Round after they were forced to play Southern League Division Two side Crystal Palace in another cup derby at the FA Cup Final venue, the Crystal Palace Park in Penge, Kent just outside of London on the same day as the league match with Burnley, with Jacky Robertson prioritising the league match, he fielded a mostly amateur reserve side in the cup, losing 7\u20131. Wilf Innerd opened the scoring for Palace, getting an early brace, followed by two goals from Mart Watkins, whose second was a penalty, to make it 4. Archie Needham and Dick Harker then added a 5th and 6th respectively, with Watkins completing his hat-trick to make it 7. Chelsea did at least manage a late consolation goal through O'Hara. To add to the Pensioners' humiliation, to this day, this defeat is the largest win a non-league side has ever registered against league opposition in the FA Cup. Chelsea wrapped up the month with a 0\u20130 draw against newly elected Leeds City at Elland Road on 25 November. Despite Chelsea's unfortunate FA Cup exit, the Blues went undefeated in the league in November, winning 3 and drawing 1 without conceding a goal, taking them back up to 3rd place and back into contention for promotion."]}, {"page": "Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C.

Palace were still playing in the claret and blue kit handed down from Aston Villa, paired with white shorts. The Magpies fielded a side featuring ten internationals, whilst Palace could count only four players who had tasted the Football League. The Glaziers captain Wilf Innerd had been on the books for Newcastle United, but had only made three appearances for the club, and Bill Forster and Archie Needham had managed twenty appearances between them for Sheffield United. The Palace team had been drawn predominately from the North of players who struggled to get into their home teams by former Middlesbrough manager Jack Robson.
