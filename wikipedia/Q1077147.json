He scored a try on his Wales debut (vs Canada) in June 2005, having only come into the Cardiff Blues side a month earlier following a starring role in the Grand Slam winning Wales Under 21 side.\nThe name Czekaj (meaning 'Wait' in English) comes from his Polish grandfather, who settled in Wales during World War II.His nickname amongst Welsh rugby supporters is '28', referring to the score his name would earn if played in a game of Scrabble.On 2 June 2007 he suffered a broken leg in the second test match against Australia, thus ruling him out of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Following a full year of recovery and rehabilitation, Czekaj resumed playing for the Blues early in the 2008\u201309 season. He returned to the Wales squad in 2009 and scored his second try four years after scoring his first, and it came against the same opposition against which he scored his first try (Canada).Czekaj has been capped Internationally in every Wales age group, from U16s to U21s until gaining his senior cap with Wales in 2005. Czekaj has also gained caps playing for Wales 7s and Barbarians. The only rugby related cap that eludes him is a Lions.\nOn 11 April 2014, the Cardiff Blues announced that Czekaj would be joining Rugby Pro D2 side US Colomiers at the end of the 2013/14 season.Following 3 years in the South of France, Czekaj moved to English Championship club Bedford Blues RFC, enjoying a 2-year spell under the guidance of Llandaff RFC, Cardiff RFC and Welsh rugby stalwart Mike Rayer.\nCzekaj is now playing at Merthyr RFC in the Centre while also fulfilling a Rugby Development role at Bishop of Llandaff high school.\nCzekaj married his long term girlfriend Kat Roberts, a former Miss Wales finalist in 2011.\nFollowing a series of concussive head injuries, Czekaj\u2019s wife Kat took to Twitter to recall the impact Chris' injuries had on them both including disorientation, memory loss and temporary alterations in personality.Czekaj is a Level 2 Qualified Rugby Coach and is currently working towards Level 3.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiff Rugby", "response": ["More signings, including former New Zealand fullback Ben Blair, further enhanced the quality of the Cardiff Blues squad for the 2006\u201307 season. Several young players from the regional academy also became established players, including Chris Czekaj and Duane Goodfield. The emergence of other highly tipped young players (notably Bradley Davies and Tom James) encouraged the belief that Cardiff Blues could soon start challenging for major honours.
