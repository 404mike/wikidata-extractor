He also had interests in Handsworth, Treeton, and Whiston . He founded a priory at Worksop c.1103,  St. Mary's Church at Handsworth, and may have founded the parish church in Sheffield at around this time.\nLovetot is credited with the building of a motte and bailey castle in Sheffield. Along with the castle, a hospital was established at what is still called \"Spital Hill\", a mill was built beside the River Don, and a bridge called Lady's Bridge was constructed where there had previously only been a ford across the river. Little is known of Sheffield prior to Lovetot, but these developments established Sheffield as the main town in the Hallamshire area.\nWilliam had four sons, with his wife Emma; Richard, Nigel, Henry and Hugh.Following the death of William de Lovetot the manor of Hallamshire passed to his elder son, Richard de Lovetot, and then to Richard's son, William de Lovetot, before being passed to Gerard de Furnival by his marriage to Maud de Lovetot in about 1204.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Worksop", "response": ["The manor then passed to William de Lovetot, who established a castle and endowed the Augustinian priory c 1103.

During the 12th century, William de Lovetot acquired most of the land within the Sheffield area including the old manors of Hallam, Sheffield, and Attercliffe. He constructed a more substantial castle in Sheffield, establishing the town as the dominant settlement within Hallamshire. Sheffield gained a sizeable parish, split from the large parish of Ecclesfield, and a larger manor which encompassed most of Hallamshire. A charter of 1268 describes Hallamshire as containing just three manors: Ecclesfield, Sheffield and Bradfield.

These strong connections gave High Street the alternative name of Prior Gate as late as the 18th century.
