His final bowling spell for his county, in the Championship game against Essex, was a disastrous 5-0-37-0 as Graham Gooch and John Stephenson ran riot. With that, Davis bowed out of county cricket for good, and in 1990/91 he went to play for Wellington in New Zealand. It proved a shrewd choice as Davis took 20 first-class wickets at 19.50 in just five matches. After that, there were a couple of exhibition matches against his old county of Glamorgan in 1991, and 54 not out for a World XI against the West Indians at Scarborough, before he returned to the Caribbean for three final domestic games. He did little in any of them, and retired from cricket."]}, {"page": "John Stephenson", "response": ["John Stephenson may refer to:", "*John Stephenson (MP) (c. 1709\u20131794), British merchant and politician", "*John Stephenson (fl.1571), MP for Hythe", "*John Stephenson (baseball) (born 1941), American baseball catcher", "*John Stephenson (cricketer, born 1903) (1903\u20131975), English cricketer", "*John Stephenson (cricketer, born 1907) (1907\u20131982), English cricketer", "*John Stephenson (cricketer, born 1965), English Test cricketer", "*John Stephenson (South African cricketer) (born 1955), South African cricketer", "*John Stephenson (footballer, born 1881) (1881\u20131940), Australian rules footballer for Carlton", "*John Stephenson (footballer, born 1883) (1883\u20131963), Australian rules footballer for Essendon", "*John Stephenson (footballer, born 1937) (1937\u20132014), Australian rules footballer for Carlton", "*John Stephenson (director) (born 1952), British film director", "*John Stephenson (actor) (1923\u20132015), American voice actor", "*John Stephenson (coachbuilder) (1809\u20131893), Irish-American coachbuilder who created the street railway ", "*John Stephenson (judge) (1910\u20131998), English barrister and judge, Lord Justice of Appeal", "*John Stephenson (physician) (1796\u20131842), Canadian physician and a co-founder of McGill University Faculty of Medicine", "*John Stephenson (zoologist) (1871\u20131933), British surgeon and zoologist"]}, {"page": "Steven Lubbers", "response": ["He became captain of the Dutch team in 1988, playing in the side that hosted an England XI the following year and taking the wickets of John Stephenson and Alec Stewart in a shock three-run victory at Amstelveen in the first of the two matches.
