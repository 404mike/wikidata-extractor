The show's chief advisor was British historian Juliet Gardiner. The family was advised on cooking and air-raid issues by home economist Marguerite Patten. The \"war cabinet\" also challenged the family at times: At one point, grandson Ben was named \"fuel warden\" and was given supervision of the family's fuel consumption. However, the family did admit to some cheating: Michael Hymers used Brylcreem for his hair, Thomas secretly listened to music by S Club 7, and both boys obtained modern snacks such as crisps from schoolmates. Lyn Hymers attempted to trade some of the show's authentic 1940s props to the neighbours for cigarettes.
