Maidenhead, who had been relegated from the Conference South the season before, won the match 1\u20130, consigning Team Bath to another season in the Southern League. Team Bath repeated their league form the following season, and once again finished as runners-up, this time behind King's Lynn. A 4\u20131 victory against Bashley in the playoff semi-final, aided by a hat-trick from the league's top-scorer Sean Canham, saw Bath reach their second successive playoff final.
