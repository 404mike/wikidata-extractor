He was at one point the tallest man in the United Kingdom and at the time of his death was the 4th tallest British-born man (after William Bradley, Neil Fingleton and Paul Sturgess) at  in height. His weight ranged from 20-30 stone (127-190 kg) during his adulthood. Greener from a very young age had a tumour at the base of his pituitary gland, which controls the release of human growth hormone. As a result of the tumour, Greener's pituitary gland released more growth hormone than in an average person, and he would have continued to grow had the tumour not been treated with radiation therapy when he was in his late 20s. He was born with a 19 inches (48 cm) length and average weight and he followed the development standards of his age during his first year of life. He was measured at 29 inches (74 cm) on his 1th birthday but his growth begun to accelerate after this point. He grew 23 inches (58 cm) within three years, reaching  by the age of four. After this initial growth spurt, he continued to grow with a steady and continuous rate. He was  tall at the age of 16 and working for a shipping company. His condition, pituitary gigantism, was not diagnosed until 1970, when Greener was 27 years old and 7\u00a0ft 5 \u00bc in (226.7\u00a0cm) tall, already the record-holder as the tallest man in Britain for over 2 years with varying heights, due to his continuous growth. He received treatment upon diagnosis, but because radiation therapy requires time to take effect, he grew another inch in the following year(s), reaching 7\u00a0ft 6 \u00bc in (229.2\u00a0cm). When Greener was first recognised as the tallest british man on December 11 1967, he was 7 ft 3.11 in (221.3 cm) tall and weighed 18 stone (114.3 kg). He held the record for 40 years from 1967 to 2007, when Neil Fingleton officially took over the title from him.
