She became known in the mid-1980s for her romantic relationship with, and subsequent marriage to, Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman, who was 34 years her senior. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1989 in music", "response": ["*April 9 \u2013 The Rolling Stones' Bill Wyman announces that he will marry 19-year-old Mandy Smith, his girlfriend for six years."]}, {"page": "Stock Aitken Waterman", "response": ["The tendency toward interchanging artists and repertoire was well established when Rick Astley's breakout album Whenever You Need Somebody got its name and title track from a minor hit the trio had produced a year earlier for O'Chi Brown. Evidently they thought the song still had some mileage, and it was even issued with an exact replica of O'chi's club mix for the Rick Astley club mix. Similarly, many of their songs were tried out and recorded by multiple artists; Mel and Kim, Pepsi and Shirlie and Sinitta all recorded the song \"Who's Gonna Catch You\", both Kylie Minogue and Mandy Smith recorded \"Got To Be Certain\", whilst Mel and Kim, Carol Hitchcock and Hazell Dean all laid down vocals for \"More Than Words Can Say\". Their prodigious, production line-like output and similar song structures led to them being referred to as the \"hit factory\" (not to be confused with the record label of the same name or the New York City recording studio The Hit Factory) and attracted criticism from many quarters, including the Guardian newspaper who unflatteringly dubbed the team, \"Schlock, Aimless and Waterdown\". However, Pete Waterman defended their style by comparing it to the output of Motown in the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Bill Wyman", "response": ["On 2 June 1989, aged 52, Wyman married 18-year-old Mandy Smith, whom he had fallen in love with when she was 13 and, according to Smith, had a sexual relationship with when she was 14."]}, {"page": "Kylie (album)", "response": ["Kylie opens with \"I Should Be So Lucky\", a light dance-pop track that uses a drum machine, keyboards and bass by Stock.;  It depicts a frustrated young woman who feels unlucky in romance and has been compared to the work of Rick Astley.; ;  For the album's version of \"The Loco-Motion\", the producers re-recorded the backing track from Duffy's demo, featuring railway sound effects and less spontaneous vocals.;  The slow-tempo \"Je ne sais pas pourquoi\" and reggae-infused \"It's No Secret\" contain melodies that are reminiscent of Waterman's earlier work in the 1960s at the Mecca Dance Hall. \"It's No Secret\" features cascading synth and a jaunty melody, whose chorus begins with the line \"Our love was a lie\".;  Minogue sings \"Got to Be Certain\", a lovelorn Hi-NRG track, in an upbeat and carefree way.;  It was first recorded by fellow PWL artist Mandy Smith for her debut album but abandoned; both versions share the same musical backing.; ; ", "Kids and teenagers were the target audience for Kylie; Waterman adapted the idea and was fascinated by how teenagers reacted to Minogue's work. It is reflected in the album's artwork, shot by photographer Lawrence Lawry, which shows Minogue grinning and wearing a hat of hair with curls cascading out of the top.;  Designer David Howells said the artwork shows Minogue in a girlie and carefree way that kids can relate to, instead of \"some icon on a pedestal\".;  He was inspired by the way teenagers tear pictures out of magazines and stick them to walls, referring to it as the \"magazine approach\". Other PWL artists posing with hats using the same strategy can be seen on the covers of Mandy Smith's Mandy (1988), Minogue's follow-up Enjoy Yourself (1989) and Sonia's Everybody Knows (1990).

I'm heavily into sequins at the moment... I don't think I would wear it down the street though,\" Minogue recalled. Like Kylie, the artwork was meant to show her in a girlie and carefree way that kids and teenagers could relate to, and not as \"some icon on a pedestal\".;  Other PWL artists used the same strategy and can be seen posing with hats on the covers of their albums.
