This caused a serious incident that involved six cars crashing into each other. Sarah Moore was the first driver to lose control of her car, spinning into the barrier at Raidillon. Abbie Eaton also lost the car and spun into the same barrier. She bounced back into Moore at low speed. Beitske Visser lost the rear end, spun around and went straight into Eaton and Moore, causing Eaton to go airbound. Ayla Agren did the same as Visser, spinning and running into Moore and an airbourne Eaton. Bel\u00e9n Garc\u00eda then hit all four cars, causing Visser to go airbourne and mount the tyre barrier. The final car of Fabienne Wohlwend then hit Beitske Visser head on, causing Visser to spin into the track and roll over. The incident ended with cars all over the track and run off areas. All drivers were checked as a precaution, and Visser and Agren were sent to hospital for x-rays and further checks. Eventually, all drivers were cleared and unharmed."]}, {"page": "Britcar", "response": ["| 2018 || Dunlop Endurance || Sarah Moore || Matt Greenwood ||  || Tockwith Motorsport || Ginetta G50"]}, {"page": "2008 Ginetta Junior Championship", "response": ["| Sarah Moore", "| Sarah Moore"]}, {"page": "Autosport Awards", "response": ["| Sarah Moore"]}, {"page": "List of 2009 motorsport champions", "response": ["|  Sarah Moore"]}, {"page": "Ginetta Junior Championship", "response": ["|  Sarah Moore Tockwith Motorsport", "| Sarah Moore"]}, {"page": "2010 Ginetta Junior Championship", "response": ["Hillspeed's Tom Ingram became champion after a strong run towards the end of the season which included weekend sweeps at Silverstone and Knockhill, as well as a season-opening victory at Thruxton.

Ingram's championship-winning margin was 65 points over Tollbar driver Jake Hill, who won ten races but championship aspirations were thwarted by a disqualification at the Brands Hatch GP meeting, and accidents at Silverstone and Brands Hatch Indy. TJ Motorsport's Louise Richardson finished third with a pair of victories at Snetterton and Brands Hatch Indy, along with ten other podium finishes including a run of eight successive podium finishes during the middle part of the season. Her team-mate Jody Fannin got the better of Tom Howard, who was a TJ driver until mid-season when he joined Hill at Tollbar, for fourth and fifth places; Fannin took victories at Brands Hatch GP and Croft, while Howard took the other victory at Rockingham.

For 2009, he entered the full Ginetta Junior Championship season, driving for TJ Motorsport, and won his first race in the series, having qualified on pole, at the Brands Hatch track. He won the second race at Brands Hatch, and later followed up these results by winning both races at Snetterton Circuit, and repeating the feat at Knockhill Circuit. However, these results were marred by a 20-point penalty for violating driving standards at Oulton Park. With six races left, Cook was leading the championship from Aaron Williamson and Sarah Moore, and a victory from the second race at Silverstone Circuit extended his lead. At the end of the season, however, Cook finished second overall, with Moore becoming the series' first female champion (having already become the series' first female race winner) by 16 points. In August of that year, Cook had joined the Motor Sport AASE programme, part of the MSA's Academy structure."]}]}}
