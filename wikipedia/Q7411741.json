Among these may be mentioned Wenceslaus Hollar's print for the 1666 Ogilby edition of Aesop's fables, in which a dog occupies the manger and barks at a single ox being driven into a wooden barn. Shortly afterwards, Francis Barlow pictured the dog snarling on a pile of hay in a brick-built barn,  while the dog does so in a more open farmyard structure in Samuel Howitt's A New Work of Animals (1810). Hollar's design of the ox turning its head to look round at the dog with the barn's brick entrance behind was clearly an influence on later illustrators, including those for the various editions of Samuel Croxall's fable collection and for Thomas Bewick's of 1818."]}, {"page": "Monkey-baiting", "response": ["This monkey-baiting inspired the famous English animal painter, Samuel Howitt, to illustrate this account in the engraving entitled The Battle of the Bulldog and the Monkey circa 1799, which preserved this fight for future generations."]}, {"page": "Shanklin Chine", "response": ["The Chine became one of the earliest tourist attractions on the Isle of Wight, with records of the public visiting the site to view it as far back as 1817.Isle of Wight Attractions website Keats found inspiration for some of his greatest poetry while staying at Shanklin in 1819 and wrote: \"The wondrous Chine here is a very great Lion; I wish I had as many guineas as there have been spy-glasses in it.\"The Letters of John Keats, John Keats, Kessinger Publishing, 2004,  Google Books It was a favourite subject for artists including Thomas Rowlandson and Samuel Howitt.

Such illustrations lent themselves to use in ornamenting domestic items, such as the wooden fireplace in Somerset House, Halifax, West Yorkshire, from about 1760Wikimedia or the design on a 1770 Royal Worcester painted plate.Wikimedia A century later, the fable figured on the set of six tiles produced by the Mintons Hollins company.

There it is given the moral \"He that has many friends has no friends\", based on Gay's opening: \"'Tis thus in friendships; who depend/ On many, rarely find a friend\". Jacobs also sentimentalises the ending, allowing the hare to escape from the hunters.pp.176-7 Although a note buried at the end of the book acknowledges that the fable was originally Gay's, the many reprintings of the prose version since have been unanimous in declaring Aesop as the fable's originator.", "There have been several distinguished illustrators of the fable. They include Thomas Bewick. and possibly his brother John, as well as Bewick's pupil William Harvey. In addition, Samuel Howitt, who was acknowledged as the principal animal illustrator of his day, produced copperplates both for individual sale and as part of his A New Work of Animals. Ernest Griset's satirical prints restore a level of political caricature to the works he illustrates. Griset's apart, the majority of the prints show the exhausted hare lying at the foot of one or other of its apologetic friends; where it is the calf, there is a scene of hunters riding across the background.", "File:HOWITT hare and friends.jpg|Samuel Howitt, 1810"]}, {"page": "The Lion, the Boar and the Vultures", "response": ["Aesop\u2019s original fable was made the subject of a painting by Frans Snyders which in the 18th century entered the collection of the dukes of Newcastle.

Illustrations of the fable have consequently depicted the gullible audience surrounding the frog as it takes its stance on the edge of the marsh, generally with the fox sitting off to one side. In Heinrich Steinh\u00f6wel's edition (1478) the listeners include nothing more exotic than a rat, a rabbit and a hedgehog, but Henry Walker Herrick (1869) and Ernest Griset (1874) furnish a more varied menagerie. Francis Barlow concentrates largely on an audience of domestic animals but places a squirrel and a monkey in the overhanging branches of a tree, where Samuel Croxall's illustrator and Thomas Bewick (1818) confine themselves to deer and farm beasts. The frog addresses these from the bank or, in the case of Samuel Howitt (1810, see above), from a marshy tussock. Later artists portray the frog as a huckster performing in front of a cluster of bystanders, as in the case of J. M. Cond\u00e9 (1905), Arthur Rackham (1912), John Vernon Lord (1989) and Arlene Graston (2016). These change the focus to the title given the story by George Fyler Townsend (1887), \"The Quack Frog\"."]}]}}
