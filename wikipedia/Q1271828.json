Additionally, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, he drew from the shock rock style of Iggy Pop; as Took explained to the NME in 1972 \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\" This allowed the management to claim subsequently that it was Took's behaviour on stage which had caused the sacking.

Williams found that the  \"narrow range and musical repetitiousness\" of the music did not matter as it made \"his records immediately recognizable on the radio.\" and that the album \"is full of songs of a slightness which is wondrous to behold. But the hushed intimacy of Bolan's vocal delivery helps to make one word do the work of ten \u2014 particularly when combined with his gift of coining oddly appealing images.\" Williams also praised the work of Tony Visconti, declaring \"I'm inclined to think that it's Visconti more than anyone who's responsible for Bolan's success; his arrangements and production give T. Rex's work a quality which the group's leader could never have achieved alone.\" Ben Edmonds of Creem felt that after \"Telegram Sam\" and \"Metal Guru\" that \"there isn't another single on the album.\" Edmonds found the other tracks on the album \"kind of bumps along from track to track [...] The rest of the material is nice but kinda lackluster, and Bolan isn't helped much by a terribly ordinary rhythm section and Mickey Finn's non-existent percussion. If you aren't already a T. Rex fanatic, then The Slider isn't going to do very much about making you one.\" Loraine Alterman of The New York Times commented on the lyrics that would \"undoubtedly sound quite profound to 14-year-old ears\" and that \"it's a long, long way from Bolan's 'Ballrooms of Mars' to Yeats' 'Byzantium'.\" Alterman concluded that \"even to ears successfully past puberty, Mr, Bolan does have a certain fey charm that in the end defies analysis.\"", "* Mickey Finn \u2013 percussion, vocals"]}, {"page": "Mickey Finn", "response": ["Mickey Finn or Micky Finn may refer to:", "* Mickey Finn (drugs), a drug-laced drink", "* Mickey Finn (comic strip), a long-running comic strip", "* Mickey Finn (drummer) (1947\u20132003), British drummer and former member of T.
