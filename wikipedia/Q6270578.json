He was also, using the name John Thomas, a member of The Banned, a British punk/new wave band in the late 1970s.Born in Hampton, Middlesex, on 6 September 1954, Davie's professional career began when he joined Gryphon at the end of 1975, and played on the last studio album recorded by the band \u2013 Treason. He joined as Graeme Taylor and Malcolm Bennett left the group as part of a significant re-shuffle of personnel. Davie remained in touch with Taylor during the next three years or so and, following the split-up of Gryphon, was introduced to Taylor's fellow Albion Band alumnus Ric Sanders (now a long-established member of Fairport Convention) who wanted to form a new jazz-influenced band with a fellow ex-member of Soft Machine, John Etheridge. This led to the formation of 2nd Vision who recorded the album First Steps for Chrysalis records in 1980. Davie was touring Europe with Dave Bristow (keyboards) and Mickey Barker (drums) as part of a jazz trio employed by Yamaha to showcase their instruments when Taylor once again appeared on the scene and asked Davie if he would care to join Home Service. As a fan the Albion Band that included John Tams and Michael Gregory, the offer was eagerly accepted. This led to an extended period of live work, both touring and as a member of what became almost a 'house band' at the National Theatre in London, appearing in productions of Dispatches, The Mysteries and Don Quixote.\nDavie has performed and recorded with a diverse range of other artists including Billy Connolly, Ivan Graziani, Andy Cronshaw, June Tabor, Martin Simpson, Gordon Giltrap, John Harle, Desmond Dekker, Michael Nyman, John B. Spencer, Rolf Harris, Mauricio Venegas (as a member of Quimantu) and John Williams. Current projects include recording a new Gryphon album, live work with the singer/composer/producer Sandy McLelland, completion of an album with Dave Lambert (Strawbs), Taylor and the violinist Tom Leary under the band name 'Zeus', and work on recently recovered live recordings of The Home Service. Several festival appearances were planned for The Home Service during summer 2011 and Davie was said to be making a one-off appearance with Quimantu in Brescia, Italy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Davies", "response": ["*Jon Davie, folk guitarist"]}, {"page": "Gryphon (band)", "response": ["In September 2007, Gryphon announced on their website that they had finally decided to produce a new album after a silence of thirty-one years. A one-off performance occurred on 6 June 2009 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, thirty-two years after their last performance. The four original members - Richard Harvey, Brian Gulland, Graeme Taylor and Dave Oberl\u00e9 - opened the evening with a selection of songs and instrumentals from the first album Gryphon. They were then joined by Jon Davie (the final bass player, who appeared on Treason) and a new member, the multi-instrumentalist and film/production music composer Graham Preskett for the rest of the evening."]}, {"page": "Home Service", "response": ["In 1982, two tracks from what was initially intended as a demo session were released as a single, \"Doing The Inglish\", with the B-side \"Bramsley\", designed to accompany the group's appearance at the Cambridge Folk Festival and their transmission on the BBC TV programme A Little Night Music. Bass player Malcolm Bennett then left the band to work as Musical Director of the National Theatre's production of Aeschylus' Oresteia and was replaced by Jon Davie. Further recording was delayed by their return to the National Theatre as a supporting band. Having been joined by keyboard player Steve King while recording, among considerable expectations, they released their eponymous first album in 1984. The album made good use of their two experienced songwriters, Tams and Caddick, and the arranging talents in the group for a mixture of original songs and traditional tunes. The result was favourably reviewed, but suffered in retrospect from the fragmented nature of the recording process among their busy schedules, leading to a lack of spontaneity.", "*Jon Davie - bass guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "John Davie (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jon Davie (born 1954), guitarist"]}, {"page": "A Cut Above", "response": ["* Jon Davie - bass"]}]}}
