A 3\u20130 win over Macclesfield Town was followed by a win over Wrexham by the same scoreline and a sense of optimism returned after Manchester City were beaten 1\u20130 at Adams Park. One of the players who helped lift the team was young striker Andy Baird, a product of the youth team. Smillie had also strengthened the team bringing in Chris Vinnicombe from Burnley on a free transfer, Dannie Bulman from Ashford Town (Middx) for \u00a310,000, Paul Emblen from Charlton Athletic for \u00a360,000, Matt Lawrence from Fulham for \u00a386,000 and hot prospect Jermaine McSporran from Oxford City for \u00a375,000. The team went into the new year looking to escape the bottom four but after a run of six games without a win Smillie was sacked.", "After the excitement of \"mission impossible\" the 1999\u20132000 season was a quiet affair. There was an enjoyable, if short-lived, run in the Football League Cup which saw a Jermaine McSporran inspired 4\u20132 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux in the second leg after a 1\u20130 defeat in the first leg. Their Black Country neighbours West Bromwich Albion were the opponents in the second round and after a 1\u20131 draw in the first leg at the Hawthorns, the Baggies won an exciting second leg 4\u20133 after extra time, the highlight being a wonderful goal from Dave Carroll. There was no flirtation with relegation as the team remained mid-table during the season, finishing 12th. Highlights included a 5\u20133 win over local rivals Reading, a 3\u20130 thrashing of enemies Colchester United and a 3\u20131 win at Wrexham which saw young full-back Danny Senda score his first goal for the Blues and another fabulous free-kick from Dave Carroll. There was almost an ignominious  exit in the FA Cup where non-league Oxford City looked to have earned a penalty shoot-out when a fire underneath the away stand meant the game had to be abandoned. The replay was replayed at Oxford United's Manor Ground with the Wanderers sneaking a 1\u20130 win. Matt Lawrence made a \u00a3250,000 move to Millwall just before transfer deadline day and Roger Johnson became the youngest ever Wycombe player to play in the Football League at 17\u00a0years and 8\u00a0days in the final game of the season.", "There was a blow at the start of the 2000\u201301 season when Sean Devine was ruled out with a serious knee injury, one that would keep him out for the whole of the campaign. There was an encouraging start to the league, with a 2\u20131 win away at Millwall, a 3\u20131 win over local rivals Oxford United at Adams Park and a 3\u20131 win against league leaders Walsall Andy Rammell score a brace in the win, who the Wanderers had just signed from the Saddlers for \u00a375,000. There was more bad news with injuries to Paul Emblen, Andy Baird and Jermaine McSporran and Sanchez, short of strikers, had to rely on the loan market, bringing in Steve Jones, Sam Parkin and triallist Niall Thompson.", "The 2001\u201302 season began with great expectations of a concerted push for promotion and Sanchez used some of the \u00a31million made from the Cup run to strengthen the side. Midfielder Darren Currie joined from Barnet for \u00a3200,000 and enjoyed a great first season at Adams Park. \u00a3200,000 bids for strikers Jamie Forrester and Chris Greenacre were unsuccessful and Gavin Holligan was signed on a free transfer from West Ham United. There was similar failed attempts to sign centre-backs Shaun Maher, Martin McIntosh and Marlon Broomes to replace Jamie Bates who retired in the summer. The season started well and the sides lost just three of the first 19 league matches. Striker Richard Walker was signed on loan from Aston Villa and in October winger Stuart Roberts signed from Swansea City for \u00a3102,500 and made his debut in a 2\u20132 away at rivals Colchester United. There was another run in the FA Cup, although a shock was only avoided in the first round as the team came from behind to win 4\u20133 away at Hayes The club was given a home tie with Premier League Fulham in the third round and after coming from a goal down, Jermaine McSporran gave the Blues a 2\u20131 lead and only an injury-time equaliser by Steve Marlet prevented another giant-killing. The replay at Craven Cottage was won by a single Barry Hayles goal. The winter saw the start of a downward spiral for the club as those in power made a series of bad decisions. Simon Monkman was appointed as the club's first Chief Executive and one of his first tasks was to secure Rugby Union side London Wasps as tenants. There was a solitary appearance of defender Carlos Lopez in a 2\u20130 at Cambridge United which has now become legendary and the club brought a new scoreboard which suffered a number of technical failures before being removed. Results on the pitch deteriorated with the team winning just three of its last 14 league games to finish 11th."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Jermaine McSporran"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|8||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jermaine McSporran"]}]}}
