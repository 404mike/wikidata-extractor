He was one of the most influential Anglican theologians of the 19th century, helping reconcile the church to some aspects of biblical criticism and scientific discovery, while remaining Catholic in his interpretation of the faith and sacraments. Also known for his social action, Gore became an Anglican bishop and founded the monastic Community of the Resurrection as well as co-founded the Christian Social Union.

His work was instrumental in the establishment of the Christian socialist movement, although he himself was not in any real sense a socialist but \"a Tory paternalist with the unusual desire to theories his acceptance of the traditional obligation to help the poor\", influenced Anglo-Catholics such as Charles Gore, who wrote that \"the principle of the incarnation is denied unless the Christian spirit can be allowed to concern itself with everything that interests and touches human life.\" Anglican focus on labour issues culminated in the work of William Temple in the 1930s and 1940s.\""]}, {"page": "January 17", "response": ["**Charles Gore (Church of England)"]}, {"page": "1892", "response": ["* July 25 \u2013 The Community of the Resurrection, an Anglican religious community for men, is founded by Charles Gore and Walter Frere, initially in Oxford."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Catholicism", "response": ["Since at least the 1970s, Anglo-Catholicism has been dividing into two distinct camps, along a fault-line which can perhaps be traced back to Bishop Charles Gore's work in the 19th century."]}, {"page": "Pusey House, Oxford", "response": ["Pusey House was opened on 9 October 1884Pall Mall Gazette, Thursday 18 September 1884, p.10 in part as a memorial to Edward Bouverie Pusey, Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford University, a canon of Christ Church Cathedral and for 40 years, a leading figure in the Oxford Movement, a movement of the mid-19th century which sought to bring the Church of England to a deeper understanding of its witness as part of the universal ('Catholic') Church. It was also intended to continue the work of Pusey in restoring the Church of England's Catholic life and witness. It was established with a fund of \u00a350,000 to provide a building for Pusey's library, purchase it and create an endowment so that two or more clergy could take charge of it and promote religious life in the university.Alden's Oxford Guide, Oxford: Alden & Co., 1958; p. 101Henry Parry Liddon described its purpose thus: \"A home of sacred learning and rallying-point for Christian faith ... It will form a centre of moral and intellectual and spiritual enthusiasm, in which all that is solid in inquiry and learning, and all that is lofty and aspiring in moral effort shall find encouragement under the consecrating shadow of a great name.\"--quoted in Alden (1958) The first principal was Charles Gore, who founded the [Community of the Ressurection] at the House in 1892.

His entry in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica asserts that Liddon's influence during his life was due to his personal fascination and his pulpit oratory rather than to his intellect. As a theologian his outlook was old-fashioned; to the last he maintained the narrow standpoint of Pusey and Keble, in defiance of modern thought and modern scholarship. The publication in 1889 of Lux Mundi edited by Charles Gore, a series of essays attempting to harmonise Anglican Catholic doctrine with modern thought, showed that even at Pusey House, established as the citadel of Puseyism at Oxford, the principles of Pusey were being departed from. He was the last of the classical pulpit orators of the English Church, the last great popular exponent of the traditional Anglican orthodoxy, with the exception of John Charles Ryle (1816-1900), the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool (1880-1900)."]}, {"page": "History of the Church of England", "response": ["The Catholic Revival had a more penetrating impact by transforming the liturgy of the Anglican Church, repositioning the Eucharist as the central act of worship in place of the daily offices, and reintroducing the use of vestments, ceremonial, and acts of piety (such as Eucharistic adoration) that had long been prohibited in the English church and (to a certain extent) in its daughter churches. It influenced Anglican theology, through such Oxford Movement figures as John Henry Newman, Edward Pusey, as well as the Christian socialism of Charles Gore and Frederick Maurice. Much work was done to introduce a more medieval style of church furnishing in many churches. Neo-Gothic in many different forms became the norm rather than the earlier Neo-Classical forms. Both revivals led to considerable missionary efforts in parts of the British Empire."]}, {"page": "Gifford Lectures", "response": ["*1929-30 Charles Gore The Philosophy of the Good Life (1930)"]}, {"page": "George Romanes", "response": ["As a young man, Romanes was a Christian, and some, including his religious wife, later said that he regained some of that belief during his final illness.'Physicus' [Romanes G.J.] 1878.

There are numerous authors who explored this area such as the case of Charles Gore, John Walvoord, Lindsay Dewar, and Charles Moule, among others.

Weston, described by Mews as a \"champion of Anglo-Catholic hardliners\", sought their trial for heresy. He was backed by the Bishop of Oxford, Charles Gore, the most vociferous of the Anglo-Catholic bishops.  Davidson's private view was that the attending bishops had been \"rash\" but the denunciations by Weston and Gore \"preposterous\" and \"absurdly vituperative\".Barber, p. 433 The issue was debated in the press for several weeks but Davidson's inclusive and pragmatic views prevailed, and the controversy dwindled away."]}, {"page": "St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham", "response": ["With the growth of industrial towns in the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a consequent growth in the number of parishes, and a need for new administrative centres.

While the cities of Liverpool and Truro constructed new cathedrals, in a number of other cities existing churches and ancient abbeys were raised to the administrative status of cathedrals.
