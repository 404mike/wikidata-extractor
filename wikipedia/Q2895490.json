Currently signed to 14th Floor Records, they have released nine studio albums, five of which (Puzzle, Only Revolutions, Opposites, Ellipsis and A Celebration of Endings)  reached the top five in the UK Albums Chart, with their sixth studio album, Opposites claiming their first UK No. 1 album. The latest three consecutive studio albums have all peaked at number one in the UK official albums chart. After their first three albums, the band expanded their following significantly in 2007 with the release of their fourth album, Puzzle, creating more mainstream songs with simpler rhythms and distancing themselves from the more unusual dissonant style present in their previous three albums. Puzzle peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart on 16 June 2007. The album went platinum in the UK in 2012, having sold over 300,000 copies.", "The first incarnation of what would eventually become Biffy Clyro was formed in 1995, when fifteen-year-old Ayr-based guitarist Simon Neil started playing his songs with friend Kilmarnock-born Ben Johnston. Ben's twin brother, James Johnston was soon brought in, and the three spent the next two years rehearsing, writing and covering songs. On 31 January 1995, they played their first gig under the name \"Skrewfish\" as the support for a band called Pink Kross at the Key Youth Centre in East Kilbride, now known as Universal Connections East Kilbride. In 1997, the trio moved to Glasgow, where Neil went to the University of Glasgow, and the Johnston twins went to Stow College, studying Electronics with Music and Audio Engineering, respectively. on Beggar's Banquet USA", "In an interview with the NME, the band stated that they had started work on a follow up to Puzzle, with Simon Neil saying that the album would include some of the band's \"heaviest riffs to date\". In an interview with XFM, Ben Johnston revealed that the forthcoming album would be \"Oli Coates\", and that they already had 16 demos laid down. Simon Neil told Kerrang magazine about the new album on 8 December, playfully saying \"The soft bits are softer, and the hard bits are harder...\", mocking how bands always label their new albums the most heavy and yet melodic so far. The band worked with Puzzle producer Garth Richardson once again at Ocean Way studios. Many videos were shown on the internet of them playing along to Shania Twain's \"You're Still the One\". A Kerrang! article, published in March 2009, stated that they planned to enter the studio in April, revealing a working title for the upcoming album: \"Boom, Blast and Ruin\". A series of weekly updates on their official site slowly revealed letters of the new album title, and, after Rock Sound mistakenly revealed the album's name as \"Only Exceptions\", it was officially announced that the album would be titled Only Revolutions.", "*On Off the Ball in August 2011, Ben Johnston said \"Well it's a marriage of two words: Biffy is in fact the nickname of the spy who the James Bond novels were based on and Clyro is a village in Wales where both our families \u2026 used to go on holiday \u2026\".", "* Ben Johnston \u2013 drums, vocals (1995\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow", "response": ["* Ben Johnston \u2013 drums, vocals"]}, {"page": "Blackened Sky", "response": ["*Ben Johnston \u2013 drums, vocals, production"]}, {"page": "Times Like These (song)", "response": ["*Ben Johnston (of Biffy Clyro) \u2013 percussion"]}, {"page": "Marmaduke Duke", "response": ["Live, the group consists JP Reid (vocals, guitar) and Simon Neil (vocals, synth, guitar and bass).
