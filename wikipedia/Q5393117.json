He also published literary works under the pseudonym John Trevena.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tintagel", "response": ["The novelist Dinah Craik visited Tintagel in 1883 and published an informative account of her journey through Cornwall the following year. William Howitt's visit was quite different: his account is called \"A day-dream at Tintagel\" (in Visits to Remarkable Places). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include Anthony Trollope's short story Malachi's Cove and the Charles and Alice Muriel Williamson's epistolary novel Set in Silver published in 1909. Ernest George Henham was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym John Trevena for many of his books; it is probable that the surname he chose was derived from the original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon. Tintagel features prominently in Edith Wharton's final, unfinished novel, The Buccaneers, the protagonist of which, Nan St. George, meets her future husband, the Duke of Tintagel, while exploring the ruins of Tintagel Castle. Wharton styled the characters as Duke and Duchess of Tintagel, while Tintagel actually lies within the Duchy of Cornwall; in the novel, the Duke and Duchess live in a newer, fictional Tintagel Castle, built in approximately the late 18th century."]}, {"page": "St Edward's School, Oxford", "response": ["* Ernest George Henham, author"]}, {"page": "Trevena", "response": ["*John Trevena, a pseudonym used by the Canadian writer Ernest George Henham"]}, {"page": "Cranmere Pool", "response": ["In Ernest George Henham's 1906 novel A Pixy in Petticoats (London: Alston Rivers), Cranmere Pool and its famous letterbox play a vital part in the plot.
