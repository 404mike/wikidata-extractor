His career highlights include reaching a Grand Slam final at the French Open in 2000 (lost to Gustavo Kuerten), and winning an ATP Masters Series title at the 2000 Rome Masters (defeated Kuerten in the final).", "Magnus Norman was known as one of the most powerful and fittest athletes on tour. On top of that, he is known for his work ethic and his perfectionism on court. During earlier stages of career he played serve and volley style tennis, influenced by his idol Stefan Edberg, but later started employing aggressive baseline play. Norman possessed a very dangerous forehand and he would often flatten his groundstrokes whenever he had a chance and go for winner. He could also generate great pace on his flat two-handed backhand. Norman also utilized drop shots and attacked the net on occasion."]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Rochdale A.F.C. season", "response": ["|24||Magnus Norman||GK||||London||||12||0||Fulham||15 August 2018||Loan||2019", "| 15 August 2018 || GK ||  || Magnus Norman || Fulham || 31 January 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["| 15 August 2018 || GK ||  || Magnus Norman || Rochdale || 31 May 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["| 7 August 2020 || GK ||  || Magnus Norman ||  Fulham || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["| 7 August 2020 || GK ||  || Magnus Norman ||  Carlisle United || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "Magnus Antony Norman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Magnus Norman (footballer)"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["|GK || || 1  ||Magnus Norman|| 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0"]}]}}
