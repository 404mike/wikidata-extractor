Husayn had already turned down Rida's proposal before. Rida's main goal for visiting the Hijaz was to convince Sharif Husayn to join his \"Society of the Arab Association\"(Jam'iyyat ul-Jami\u2018a al-Arabiyya) to form an alliance among the rulers of the Arabian Peninsula, which he had earlier informed his son Abdullah in 1914. He repeated the basic programme of the Society, i.e., to form an alliance with the Emirate of Nejd and the rulers of \u2018Asir, Yemen; with each ruler retaining autonomy in internal administrative affairs, uniting to defend the Arabian Peninsula from foreign threats, and cooperate in the future to save Arab lands from foreign occupation. The alliance would be headed by the \"Council of the Alliance\"(Majlis al-Hilf), headquartered in Mecca, which would convene annually to discuss common interests and Husayn was offered candidacy for its presidency. However Husayn, fearing a weakening of his political power, rejected Rida's proposals staunchly and made clear his intentions to attack the other rulers. Rida's anti-European attitudes, his advocacy of a pan-Islamic union and his rejection of Husayn's claims to the Caliphate, made him persona non-grata in the Hijaz. In mid-October 1916, Rida returned to Egypt empty-handed and from then on, began to develop enmity with Husayn. Rida would never forgive Husayn for refusing his proposals to arrive at a pan-Islamic union. His journal Al-Manar began to increasingly criticise Husayn, condemning him as being driven by personal ambition in his efforts to become king of Arabs and Caliph, with reliance upon British power. Rida vehemently condemned Sharif Husayn for his secret agreements with the British empire that jeopardised the independence of Iraq and Syria. By May 1917, their conflict became an open rift and Al-Manar was banned in the Hashemite Kingdom. The Russian empire was party to the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement and when the Bolsheviks came to power, Soviet Russia released the full-text of the agreement to the Press, embarrassing the British. Rida vehemently condemned the British and French, for their unveiled plans to occupy Arab lands.Peter Mansfield, The British Empire  magazine, no. 75, Time-Life Books, 1973 "]}, {"page": "Middle East International", "response": ["* Peter Mansfield"]}]}}
