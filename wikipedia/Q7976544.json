He joined Barnet following his release in the summer of 2000, where he recorded one of the FA Cup's fastest ever hat-tricks against Havant & Waterlooville in a Fourth Qualifying Round Replay in 2001. The hat-trick was timed at just four minutes which saw the Bees through to the First round Proper. He then signed for Leyton Orient for \u00a39,000 in March 2003, scoring a hat-trick on his debut. In August 2004 he joined ambitious Hornchurch for \u00a315,000, but the club quickly ran into financial difficulties and, following 11 goals in 14 league games, he joined League One side Peterborough United on a free transfer. At the end of the season, however, new manager Mark Wright told Purser to find a new club. He rejoined Hill at Weymouth, but missed the majority of his first season with an eye injury. He joined Eastleigh on-loan for a month in September 2006 to regain match fitness, but he was released from his contract at Weymouth in January 2007 by mutual consent. He joined Cambridge later that day, but was released at the end of the season. He spent several months at East Thurrock United before signing for Wivenhoe Town for the remainder of the season, although he only made one appearance there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Danny Potter", "response": ["Born in Ipswich, Danny Potter started his career as a trainee at Premiership club Chelsea but after failing to make the grade there dropped into lower league football with short spells at Chelmsford City, Weymouth and Exeter City. He came to prominence when he joined Canvey Island in March 2003 along with Lee Boylan and Wayne Purser who were with him at Canvey Island, with whom he gained promotion to the Conference, and on a number of occasions proved to be a key player for them with his solid goalkeeping skills. After Canvey dropped out of the Conference, he was signed by Stevenage Borough by new manager Mark Stimson and promptly impressed in pre-season."]}, {"page": "Purser (surname)", "response": ["*Wayne Purser (born 1980), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Wayne Montague Purser", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wayne Purser"]}]}}
