He made his senior debut four months later and established himself in the first-team in the 2017\u201318 season. He was sold on to Salford City in June 2018, though spent the second half of the 2018\u201319 season on loan at National League rivals FC Halifax Town, before returning to Salford to help the club to win promotion into the English Football League with victory in the 2019 play-off final. He spent much of the 2019\u201320 season out on loan at Stockport County and FC Halifax Town.

Form under Jones deteriorated, with only 13 points gained from a possible 54. After a 1\u20130 win against Cambridge United, which put them nine points clear of relegation, Hartlepool failed to win their next eight matches. With three games to go, Hartlepool dropped into the relegation zone after a pitiful loss at home to Barnet. That prompted a passionate rant by Jeff Stelling live on Soccer Saturday, which resulted in the sacking of Dave Jones. The final round of fixtures meant either Newport County or Hartlepool would be relegated to the National League, alongside Leyton Orient. After being 1\u20130 down to Doncaster Rovers in front of a sell-out crowd, Hartlepool looked doomed. Although substitute Devante Rodney scored two unanswered goals to leave Hartlepool above the relegation zone, an 89th-minute goal for Newport consigned Hartlepool to non-league football after 96 years in the Football League."]}, {"page": "Danny Pugh", "response": ["On 18 September 2018, Pugh took on extra coaching duties at Port Vale following the departure of coach Gary Brabin. Neil Aspin resigned on 30 January 2019, and Pugh stepped in to serve as caretaker-manager. John Askey was appointed as manager on 4 February, before Pugh had the chance to take charge of any first-team games. Pugh became a full-time coach upon the expiry of his playing contract at the end of the season, though did take the #14 shirt and sat on the bench following a midfield injury crisis in September 2019. Pugh again became caretaker-manager following Askey's departure on 4 January 2021. Five days later he oversaw a 3\u20130 home win over Grimsby Town in his first game in management. On 18 January, he began self-isolating after testing positive for COVID-19. Club chairperson Carol Shanahan said that Pugh had been unlucky during his time in charge, missing Tom Pope and Devante Rodney to injury and having to self-isolate at home for two games, and she confirmed that Pugh had not applied for the role on a permanent basis. He returned to the touchline in time to oversee a 5\u20131 victory over bottom-club Southend United.

He stated that \"when I was here before it wasn\u2019t really a good time personally but now I am here to put things right\". It was reported that Grimsby manager Ian Holloway had tried to sign him but lost out due to his club insisting on a clause to reduce pay if the league was postponed or cancelled again due to a second wave of Coronavirus disease 2019 cases; Vale reportedly had no such clause in their contract offer. On 5 September, he scored on his second debut for the Vale, coming on as a substitute to score a late winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Scunthorpe United in the first round of the EFL Cup, manager John Askey said that \"It's nice when you have someone like Theo who can come on and has goals in him\". Robinson set a personal target of 10 goals for the campaign but said the main aim was promotion. Having started the 2020\u201321 season on the bench, he claimed a place in the starting eleven by mid-October after becoming the club's leading scorer. He soon dropped out of the starting eleven however and was transfer-listed in December. Caretaker-manager Danny Pugh deregistered Robinson from the club's 22-man squad the following month in order to make room for new signing Kurtis Guthrie. He was re-registered at the end of the January transfer window and went on to earn praise for his work-rate from new manager Darrell Clarke but was still transfer-listed in May 2021.

A brace by Hartlepool United's Devante Rodney put his side 2\u20131 up against Doncaster Rovers, leaving Newport County in 23rd and seven minutes away from relegation as they were drawing 1\u20131 at the time. In the 89th minute, Newport County defender Mark O'Brien chested a cross down and volleyed it into the bottom corner from inside the penalty box, putting his team 2\u20131 up and sending Hartlepool United back into 23rd position. It was O'Brien's second goal in his career, his first for Newport County, and ultimately proved to be the game-winning goal for Newport County, who stayed up in League Two. Despite defeating Doncaster Rovers, Hartlepool United wound up being relegated from the Football League after 96 years.
