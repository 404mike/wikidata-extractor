He moved to St Johnstone in December 1975. St Johnstone sent him on loan in 1977 to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League.  In 1978, the Rowdies traded the American rights to Anderson to the Houston Hurricane in exchange for draft picks.  Houston then purchased his contract from St Johnstone.  That fall, the Houston Summit became a member of the Major Indoor Soccer League.  The team was essentially the Houston Hurricane in an indoor guise. He was a 1978\u20131979 MISL All Star with Houston.\nWhen both the Hurricane and Summit collapsed in 1980, Anderson signed with the Cleveland Force of MISL.  In December 1980, the Rowdies selected Anderson in the NASL Dispersal Draft which included players from the disbanded Hurricane.  While the team wanted him for the NASL indoor season, he remained with the Force for the rest of the season, garnering first team All Star honors.  He returned to the Rowdies for the 1981 outdoor season before moving indoors permanently that fall with the Force.\nOn January 6, 1982, the New Jersey Rockets purchased Anderson from the Cleveland Force. and in February 1982, Anderson replaced the fired Timo Liekoski as head coach of the New Jersey Rockets.  In 1983, he moved to the Wichita Wings, where he played two seasons.  In October 1985, he signed with the Canton Invaders of the American Indoor Soccer Association.  In 1986\u20131987, he coached the Kansas Argyles, an independent indoor soccer team.Anderson died suddenly on 5 November 2008 at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, leaving behind his wife Jacqueline, two adult children Justin and Keri, and a granddaughter named Grace. His funeral service was held one week later in Mortonhall Crematorium Pentland Chapel, Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Buffalo Stallions", "response": ["*1979\u20131980\u00a0\u2013 All-MISL Team\u00a0\u2013 Ian Anderson"]}, {"page": "New Jersey Rockets (MISL)", "response": ["* Ian Anderson (1982)"]}, {"page": "Wichita Wings", "response": ["St. Louis would get revenge at the end of the 1983-84 season, sweeping the Wings in the semifinals.

Kim R\u00f8ntved was named the league's Defender of the Year. The team's finances were bolstered by excellent attendance at 9,391 per game. The 1984-85 season was a disappointing one for the team. The Wings would end with a losing record of 21-26 and lose in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. However, they added two players that would have a long-term impact. Terry Rowe was a talented defender from London, England. Danish sensation Erik Rasmussen earned his nickname, \"The Wizard,\" due to his dynamic abilities on the ball. He would become a record-setting player during his career with the Wings. In 1988, he earned the team's only MISL MVP award."]}, {"page": "Ian Anderson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Ian Anderson (born 1947) is a British musician, best known as the leader of the rock band Jethro Tull.", "Ian Anderson may also refer to:", "* Ian Anderson (New Zealand cricketer) (1922\u20131977), New Zealand cricketer", "* Ian Anderson (South African cricketer) (born 1935), South African cricketer", "* Ian Anderson (snooker player) (born 1946), Australian snooker player", "* Ian Anderson (Australian footballer) (born 1948), Australian rules footballer", "* Ian Anderson (Scottish footballer) (1954\u20132008), Scottish football defender", "* Ian Anderson (baseball) (born 1998), American baseball player", "* Ian Anderson (Manx politician) (1925\u20132005), Manx (Isle of Man) politician and former President of the Legislative Council", "* Ian Anderson (British politician) (1953\u20132011), British National Front leader", "* Ian Anderson (Australian) (born 1965), Australian academic and senior public servant"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 in Scottish football", "response": ["* 5 November \u2013 Ian Anderson, 54, Dundee and St Johnstone player."]}, {"page": "List of Cleveland Force (1978\u201388) players", "response": ["* Ian Anderson, D (1980\u201382) 48 games, 34 goals, 36 assists"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2008", "response": ["*Ian Anderson, 54, Scottish footballer."]}, {"page": "Cleveland Force (1978\u201388)", "response": ["* 1980\u201381 Ian Anderson, D"]}, {"page": "Houston Summit", "response": ["* Ian Anderson (1978\u201379)", "* Ian Anderson (1979\u201380)"]}, {"page": "2008 in Scotland", "response": ["* 5 November \u2013 Ian Anderson, footballer (born 1954)"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Major Indoor Soccer League season", "response": ["| align=left | Ian Anderson", "|Ian Anderson|| Houston Summit || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0.00 || 0 || 0", "|Ian Anderson, Houston"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Major Indoor Soccer League season", "response": ["|Ian Anderson, Houston", "|Ian Anderson, Houston"]}, {"page": "1977 Tampa Bay Rowdies season", "response": ["|Steve Wegerle (2), Ian Anderson, Rodney Marsh", "|Adrian Alston, David Robb, Ian Anderson", "| align=left |Ian Anderson||11||2||0||4", "| align=center|3 || align=center|MF ||  Ian Anderson ||  St. Johnstone F.C. || on loan || May 16, 1977 ||"]}, {"page": "1954 in Scotland", "response": ["* 11 September \u2013 Ian Anderson, footballer (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 American Indoor Soccer Association season", "response": ["On February 5 the defending champion, Canton Invaders, hosted the first ever AISA All-Star Game at the Canton Memorial Civic Center.
