Ripsher helped and supported the boys through the club's formative years, reorganised and found premises for the club. In April 1884 the club was renamed \"Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\" to avoid confusion with another London club named Hotspur, whose post had been mistakenly delivered to North London.
