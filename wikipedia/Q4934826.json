He served on the committee from 1884, was appointed honorary secretary and treasurer in 1890 and was elected to the first board of directors in 1898.\nJust two years later, at the turn of the century in 1900, Buckle resigned from the board after overseeing the adoption of professional status, the formation of the Limited Company and the move to White Hart Lane.\nDuring his Tottenham career between the years of 1882 and 1895 he has a recorded 25 goals in 53 appearances although it is likely that this number is higher with unrecorded games taken into consideration.\n\nAs work began on the Northumberland Development Project to build Tottenham Hotspur a new ground in 2017, a group of fans began campaigning for a blue plaque to be mounted on the house in White Hart Lane where Buckle lived when he helped found the club and which became its first postal address.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
