A freelance writer since 1978, Moore is unusual among professionally trained Canadian historians in that he supports himself by writing for general audiences. He is a longtime columnist for Canada's History magazine (formerly The Beaver) and the author of many books. He has twice won the Governor General's Literary Awards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coalition government", "response": ["According to historian Christopher Moore, coalition governments in Canada became much less possible in 1919, when the leaders of parties were no longer chosen by elected MPs but instead began to be chosen by party members. Such a manner of leadership election had never been tried in any parliamentary system before. According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form. Moore shows that the diffusion of power within a party tends to also lead to a diffusion of power in the parliament in which that party operates, thereby making coalitions more likely."]}, {"page": "William Lyon Mackenzie King", "response": ["Historian Christopher Moore says, \"King had made 'Parliament will decide' his maxim, and he trotted it out whenever he wished to avoid a decision.\" He was keenly sensitive to the nuances of public policy; he was a workaholic with a shrewd and penetrating intelligence and a profound understanding of the complexities of Canadian society. His strength was apparent when he synthesized, built support for, and passed measures that had reached a level of broad national support. Advances in the welfare state were an example. His successors, especially Diefenbaker, Pearson, and Trudeau built the welfare state which he had advanced during the Second World War into the modern cradle-to-grave system."]}, {"page": "Fortress of Louisbourg", "response": ["Dozens of researchers worked on the project over a span of five decades.

In 1719, 823 people called this maritime city their home.  Seven years later, in 1726, the population was 1,296, in 1734 it was 1,616, and by 1752, the population of Louisbourg was 4,174.B.A. Balcom.  \"The Cod Fishery of Isle Royale, 1713-58\" in Aspects of Louisbourg.

The North Atlantic fishing trade employed over ten thousand people, and Louisbourg was seen as the \u2018nursery for seamen.\u2019 Louisbourg was an important investment for the French government because it gave them a strong commercial and military foothold in the Grand Banks.  For France, the fishing industry was more lucrative than the fur trade.A.J.B Johnston.  \"From Port de peche to ville fortifiee: The Evolution of Urban Louisbourg 1713\u20131858\" in Aspects of Louisbourg.  The University College of Cape Breton Press, Sidney Nova Scotia 1995, page 4  In 1731, Louisbourg fishermen exported 167,000 quintals of cod and 1600 barrels of cod-liver oil.  There were roughly 400 shallop-fishing vessels out each day vying for the majority of the days catch.  Also, 60 to 70 ocean-going schooners would head out from Louisbourg to catch fish further down the coast.Christopher Moore, Louisbourg Portraits, Toronto, Ontario: McClelland and Stewart Ltd, 2000, page 109, 261-270.  Louisbourg's commercial success was able to bring ships from Europe, The West Indies, Quebec, Acadia, and New England.", "Louisbourg was one of the \"largest military garrisons in all of New France\", and many battles were fought and lives lost here because of it. The fort had the embrasures to mount 148 guns; however, historians have estimated that only 100 embrasures had cannons mounted. Disconnected from the main fort, yet still a part of Louisbourg, a small island in the harbour entrance was also fortified. The walls on the Island Battery were  high, and  thick. Thirty-one 24-pound guns were mounted facing the harbour. The island itself was small, with room for only a few small ships to dock there.Christopher Moore, Louisbourg Portraits, Toronto, Ontario: McClelland and Stewart Ltd, 2000, page 66.

Macdonald advised Governor General the Earl of Dufferin to prorogue parliament in order to stop the work of a committee investigating Macdonald's involvement in the Pacific Scandal. While the Governor General did reluctantly accept advice to prorogue parliament, he insisted that the prorogation be limited to a period of ten weeks, and that a commission be appointed to continue the hearings, which would report to parliament when it reconvened. When parliament returned and the commission presented their findings, Macdonald was censured and had to resign. According to Christopher Moore, it was at this point that the relationship between backbenchers and the prime minister began an evolution; \"MacDonald himself became one of the inventors of the 'party machine'\u2014the party as a disciplined, centralized, loyal team that would not dare to turn on him as it had in 1873.\" By the mid-20th century, parliamentary caucuses were being told by their leaders that they had \"no right to question what a leader did or said\".", "Christopher Moore opined in Canada's History that \"no great web of new legislation or constitutional procedure is needed to rein in the abuse of prime ministerial powers. Other parliaments around the world regularly see party leaders and prime ministers dumped when their own backbenchers and prime ministers   grow tired of them. If our premiers and prime ministers knew that legislatures would rebuke them for abusing parliament (as did the backbenchers in the legislature of 1873), we would not have to worry about rogue prorogations.\""]}, {"page": "Expulsion of the Loyalists", "response": ["*Christopher Moore; The Loyalists: Revolution, Exile, Settlement; 1984, ."]}, {"page": "2011 Governor General's Awards", "response": ["| Christopher Moore, From Then to Now: A Short History of the World"]}, {"page": "Christopher Moore (Canadian Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Moore (Canadian historian) "]}, {"page": "Mr. Christie's Book Awards", "response": ["|Janet Lunn and Christopher Moore, The Story of Canada"]}, {"page": "Courts of Ontario", "response": ["The 1849 statute abolished the court of appeal and established the Court of Error and Appeal to hear appeals from both the two common law courts and the court of chancery. This new court was composed of the judges of the three courts, like the Court of Exchequer Chamber in England. The Court of Error and Appeal first sat at Osgoode Hall on 8 March 1850. Christopher Moore describes it as \"the first independent and professional court of appeal for the future Ontario\". Before this court was established, the final appeal of a decision within soon-to-be Ontario (some decisions could be appealed to the Privy Council) lay to the province's executive council; thus, executive and judicial functions were fused, in a manner typical in the common law world at the time. In 1874,37 Vict, c\u00a07 (Ontario) the Court of Error and Appeal was reconstituted and thereafter consisted of five judges who had no other duties than to sit as judges of the Court of Appeal.
