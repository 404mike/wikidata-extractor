He did not approach the architectural profession in the traditional way, namely either by rising up from a craft or through early exposure to the Office of Works, although there is evidence that Christopher Wren obtained information that recorded Jones as an apprentice joiner in St Paul's Churchyard.Colvin, Howard, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects: 1600 to 1840 (1954) At some point before 1603 a rich patron (possibly the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Rutland) sent him to Italy to study drawing after being impressed by the quality of his sketches. From Italy he travelled to Denmark where he worked for Christian IV on the design of the palaces of Rosenborg and Frederiksborg.", "Jones first became famous as a designer of costumes and stage settings, especially after he brought \"masques\" to the stage. Under the patronage of Queen Anne of Denmark (the consort of King James I), he is credited with introducing movable scenery and the proscenium arch to English theatre. Between 1605 and 1640, he was responsible for staging over 500 performances, collaborating with Ben Jonson for many years, despite a relationship fraught with competition and jealousy: the two had arguments about whether stage design or literature was more important in theatre. (Jonson ridiculed Jones in a series of his works, written over a span of two decades.)See: The Masque of Augurs; The Staple of News; A Tale of a Tub; Love's Welcome at Bolsover. Jonson's follower Richard Brome also took a swipe at Jones in The Weeding of Covent Garden. Over 450 drawings for the scenery and costumes survive, demonstrating Jones's virtuosity as a draughtsman and his development between 1605 and 1609 from initially showing \"no knowledge of Renaissance draughtsmanship\" to exhibiting an \"accomplished Italianate manner\"Orgel, Steven and Strong, Roy C., Inigo Jones and the theatre of the Stuart Court, 1973 and understanding of Italian set design, particularly that of Alfonso and Giulio Parigi. This development suggests a second visit to Italy, circa 1606,Gotch, A. J., Inigo Jones, 1968 influenced by the ambassador Henry Wotton. Jones learned to speak Italian fluently and there is evidence that he owned an Italian copy of Andrea Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura with marginalia that refer to Wotton. His architectural work was particularly influenced by Palladio.The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., Palladio and English-American Palladianism  To a lesser extent, he also held to the architectural principles of the ancient Roman writer Vitruvius.", "Jones's first recorded architectural design is for a monument to Frances, Lady Cotton, commissioned by Rowland Cotton, circa 1608\u20131611,Giles Worsley, Inigo Jones and the European Classical Tradition (Yale, 2007), pp. 6, 8\u20139. at Norton-in-Hales, Shropshire showing early signs of his classical intentions.John Newman, \"An Early Drawing by Inigo Jones and a Monument in Shropshire\", The Burlington Magazine 115 (843) (June 1973), pp.\u00a0360+ In July 1606 Jones made scenery for a masque at Theobalds for the Earl of Salisbury. In the following years, Jones made drawings for the Earl of Salisbury's New Exchange in the Strand, where work commenced in June 1608,Giles Worsley, Inigo Jones and the European Classical Tradition (Yale, 2007), p. 7. and the central tower of St. Paul's Cathedral, displaying a similar practical architectural inexperience and immature handling of themes from sources including Palladio, Serlio and Sangallo. In 1609, having perhaps accompanied Salisbury's son and heir, Viscount Cranborne, around France, he appears as an architectural consultant at Hatfield House, making small modifications to the design as the project progressed, and in 1610, Jones was appointed Surveyor to Prince Henry. He devised the masques the Barriers and the Masque of Oberon for the Prince and was possibly involved in some alterations to St James's Palace.Edward Chaney and Timothy Wilks, The Jacobean Grand Tour: Early Stuart Travellers in Europe (I.B. Tauris: London, 2014), pp. 64\u20136, 153.", "More than 1000 buildings have been attributed to Jones but only a very small number of those are certain to be his work. According to architecture historian John Summerson, the modern concept of an architect's artistic responsibility for a building did not exist at that time, and Jones's role in many instances may be that of a civil servant in getting things done rather than as an architect. Jones's contribution to a building may also simply be verbal instructions to a mason or bricklayer and providing an Italian engraving or two as a guide, or the correction of drafts. In the 1630s, Jones was in high demand and, as Surveyor to the King, his services were only available to a very limited circle of people, so often projects were commissioned to other members of the Works. Stoke Bruerne Park in Northamptonshire was built by Sir Francis Crane, \"receiving the assistance of Inigo Jones\", between 1629 and 1635. Jones is also thought to have been involved in another country house, this time in Wiltshire. Wilton House was renovated from about 1630 onwards, at times worked on by Jones, then passed on to Isaac de Caus when Jones was too busy with royal clients. He then returned in 1646 with his student, John Webb, to try and complete the project.  Contemporary equivalent architects included Sir Balthazar Gerbier and Nicholas Stone.", "There is an Inigo Jones Road in Charlton, south east London (SE7), near Charlton House, some of whose features were allegedly designed by him.", "A bridge in Llanrwst, North Wales, named \"Pont Fawr\" is also known locally as \"Pont Inigo Jones\"\u2014Inigo Jones's Bridge.", "He is also said to be responsible for the Masonic Document called \"The Inigo Jones Manuscript\", from around 1607.
