In the 1980s he made shows for Radio Mercury, which included Andrew Marshall Meets The Stars, a Sunday afternoon show which usually would feature an interview with at least one famous person among other people with lesser claims to fame, on occasions the show did feature some of the biggest names in both the UK and United States.\nMarshall also presented shows on County Sound in the 1990s and was a regular stand-in presenter for Martin Campbell on his country music show, \"Country Plus.\" After he left Mercury and County Sound (by this time the stations had merged), he became a freelance journalist.
