The party reached the top of the mountain at 1:15 PM. Toasts were made with champagne, doves were released from the summit to announce their success, and d'Angeville was hoisted on the men's shoulders and cheered. A cannon salute welcomed them on their return to Chamonix. The celebrations the next day also included a special guest, at d'Angeville's request, the now sixty-year-old Maria Paradis. Also present in Chamonix during that time, though he left the day before d'Angeville's successful climb, was a young, poor, and hopeful author and mountaineer Albert Richard Smith. Smith had tried to attach himself to an expedition but would not climb the mountain until 1851, after which he turned his experience into a theatrical show; he notes d'Angeville's expedition (and the \"Polish gentleman [sic]\") in his \"Ascent of Mont Blanc.\"Smith 392."]}, {"page": "Angus Reach", "response": ["In 1854 Reach suffered an attack described variously in contemporary accounts as a \"paralytic\" illness and a \"softening of the brain\", and identified by modern biographers as a probable cerebral haemorrhage. The attack left Reach unable to work and to provide for his wife: his friends, led by the author Albert Richard Smith, organised a benefit performance at the Olympia Theatre in London to raise funds to support Reach's family during his incapacitation. The performance included many of the works Reach himself had written or translated: all the seats in the house sold out, and such figures as Charles Dickens numbered among the audience. A repeat performance, at the Drury Lane Theatre, was attended by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

The Gentleman's Magazine became the forum for discussion of the topic. There was a heated debate in 1787, followed by another in 1840 when the spelling was promoted in a book by Frederic Madden, who insisted that new manuscript evidence proved that the poet always wrote his name \"Shakspere\". Isaac D'Israeli wrote a strongly worded letter condemning this spelling as a \"barbaric curt shock\". There followed a lengthy correspondence, mainly between John Bruce, who insisted on \"Shakspere\" because \"a man's own mode of spelling his own name ought to be followed\" and John William Burgon, who argued that \"names are to be spelt as they are spelt in the printed books of the majority of well-educated persons\", insisting that this rule authorised the spelling \"Shakspeare\". Various other contributors added to the debate.The Gentleman's Magazine, Volume 13, passim. A number of other articles covered the spelling dispute in the 19th century, in which the \"Shakspere\" spelling generally was promoted on the grounds that it was the poet's own. Albert Richard Smith in the satirical magazine The Month claimed that the controversy was finally \"set to rest\" by the discovery of a manuscript which proved that the spelling changed with the weather, \"When the sun shone he made his 'A's, / When wet he took his 'E's.\"Albert Smith & John Leech, The Month, a view of passing subjects and manners, London, 1851, p. 316.
