He was born in Stroud, Gloucestershire.\nHe was educated at The Crypt School, Gloucester, and St. John's College, Cambridge. He wrote his doctorate in  1920 at the  University of Bristol. He became a lecturer in Greek at the University of Glasgow from 1920 to 1944. On that year, he returned to the University of Bristol where he became Professor of Greek and emeritus in 1962. He concentrated on studies of Greek tragedy, especially translations of the works of Sophocles.\nHis early book, \"In the Mountains of Greece\", describes his journeys in that country, with no more than incidental reference to antiquity.\nHis 1952 general treatment The Greeks covered the whole range of ancient Greek culture, and became a standard text.After his retirement, he taught at College Year in Athens (CYA), a study abroad program for foreign students in Athens, Greece.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antigone (Sophocles play)", "response": ["* 1962 \u2013 H.

For example, Richard Claverhouse Jebb claimed that \"The Oedipus Tyrannus is in one sense the masterpiece of Attic tragedy. No other shows an equal degree of art in the development of the plot; and this excellence depends on the powerful and subtle drawing of the characters.\" Cedric Whitman noted that \"the Oedipus Rex passes almost universally for the greatest extant Greek play...\" Whitman himself regarded the play as \"the fullest expression of this conception of tragedy,\" that is the conception of tragedy as a \"revelation of the evil lot of man,\" where a man may have \"all the equipment for glory and honor\" but still have \"the greatest effort to do good\" end in \"the evil of an unbearable self for which one is not responsible. Edith Hall referred to Oedipus the King as \"this definitive tragedy\" and notes that \"the magisterial subtlety of Sophocles' characterization thus lend credibility to the breathtaking coincidences,\" and notes the irony that \"Oedipus can only fulfill his exceptional god-ordained destiny because Oedipus is a preeminently capable and intelligent human being.\" H. D. F. Kitto said about Oedipus Rex that \"it is true to say that the perfection of its form implies a world order,\" although Kitto notes that whether or not that world order \"is beneficent, Sophocles does not say.\"", "* H.

Kitto argues that the term chorus gives us hints about its function in the plays of ancient Greece: \"The Greek verb choreuo, 'I am a member of the chorus', has the sense 'I am dancing'. The word ode means not something recited or declaimed, but 'a song'. The 'orchestra', in which a chorus had its being, is literally a 'dancing floor'.\" From this, it can be inferred that the chorus danced and sang poetry."]}, {"page": "Electra (Sophocles play)", "response": ["* H.
