Although he was given a wage of 10 shillings per week, he continued to work locally as a labourer. He described his two streams of income as making him \"feel like a millionaire\". The Cardiff squad was undergoing a significant overhaul under the management team of secretary-manager Fred Stewart and trainer George Latham; all but four of the senior team players they had inherited from previous manager Davy McDougall were released. The pair were impressed by Keenor's performances and handed him first-team opportunities at the end of the 1912\u201313 season. Keenor featured in two friendly matches, a 9\u20130 victory over Bridgend YMCA, in which he scored, and a 1\u20131 draw with Mid Rhondda. The presence of Billy Hardy, Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey, who became known as the \"holy three\" by fans, restricted his first-team opportunities as the trio ensured the club won promotion to the First Division of the Southern Football League after conceding just 15 goals during the campaign. Keenor was forced to wait until 6 December 1913 to make his competitive debut for the club, playing in a 1\u20131 draw with Exeter City in the First Division. He endured a difficult start and was described in a local newspaper report as \"the weak link in a very strong side\". He made just two further appearances for the side during the remainder of the 1913\u201314 season. He featured in a 2\u20131 victory over Plymouth Argyle and a 0\u20130 draw with Millwall.", "During the season, Cardiff came under pressure from local newspapers, most notably the Western Mail, for the club's perceived lack of contributions to the war effort. The Western Mail printed numerous scathing comments focused on association football clubs and even refused to report on Cardiff's matches for a time. The club later countered the paper's actions by accusing it of chasing \"cheap popularity\". Keenor, himself a patriot, was torn between the two, having finally established himself in the first team after three years at Ninian Park. He eventually enlisted in February 1915, along with teammate Jack Stephenson, trainer George Latham, who had previous military experience having served in the Second Boer War, and two of the club's directors. He joined the 17th Middlesex Battalion, which became known as the Football Battalion due to the many footballers who made up the core of the unit. Led by former England international Frank Buckley, the regiment had been founded by William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford, in December 1914 in the hope of attracting footballers and fans into enlisting in the armed forces."]}, {"page": "Welsh Sports Hall of Fame", "response": ["* George Latham (Association Football) *"]}, {"page": "1881 in Wales", "response": ["*1 January \u2013 George Latham, footballer (died 1939)"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|George Latham"]}, {"page": "List of Cardiff City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["*Oldest player: George Latham \u2013 41 years 1 day vs. Blackburn Rovers \u2013 2 January 1922"]}, {"page": "South Wales derby", "response": ["Cardiff were promoted to the First Division of the Southern Football League at the end of the 1912\u201313 season.

Two friendlies were played in April 1919 as the clubs began to prepare for a return of competitive football at the end of hostilities with both sides winning a match each. The popularity of the derby quickly became obvious as the first post First World War league fixture attracted a season high crowd of 15,500 for Swansea, who claimed a 2\u20131 victory, while Cardiff recorded its first victory in the return fixture on 7 February 1920, defeating the Swans 1\u20130 at Ninian Park following George Beare's goal. The second fixture was attended by 24,317 spectators, the largest crowd ever recorded in the Southern League at the time.

Among his early signings were Arthur Waters from his former club and brothers George and John Burton, while George Latham was appointed as a player-coach.

In April 1912, Jack Evans became the first Cardiff player to be capped in an international match when he played for Wales against Ireland. George Latham was the only other Cardiff player to play in an international match before the First World War. Fred Keenor was the first player to win a cap after the war, in March 1920, while Jimmy Blair became the first Cardiff player to represent a country other than Wales when he played for Scotland against Ireland later the same year. Bert Smith became the first Irish international at the club the following year. Keenor attained 31 caps during his time with Cardiff, becoming the club's highest capped player prior to the Second World War.

He was forced to wait another month to make his second appearance for the club, playing in place of Jimmy Gill during a 2\u20131 victory over Everton on 18 October 1924. With Gill injured, Beadles was handed a run of games in the first-team and responded by scoring five goals in four matches during November 1924, including a brace during a 4\u20131 victory over Bury. His prolific form saw Clennell unable to regain his place in the side as Beadles scored four more goals for the club in December, including scoring in consecutive matches against West Ham United on Christmas Day and Boxing Day 1924. However, he was unable to maintain his form and a goal drought, failing to score in ten matches in January and early February 1925, led to manager Fred Stewart dropping Beadles from the side. He appeared sporadically for the side during the remainder of the 1924\u201325 season, eventually breaking his goal drought during a second 2\u20131 victory over Everton, as Stewart offered chances to other players, including Clennell, Alfie Hagan and Paddy McIlvenny."]}, {"page": "George Latham", "response": ["George Latham may refer to:", "*George Latham (footballer) (1881\u20131939), Welsh professional footballer and coach", "*George Latham (architect) (died 1871), English architect"]}, {"page": "1910\u201311 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| George Latham"]}, {"page": "Great Britain men's Olympic football team", "response": ["| 1920||align=left| George Latham|| 1920 squad||1st round||\u2013"]}, {"page": "History of Cardiff City F.C.

The departure of Pagnam allowed Len Davies to make his first appearances of the season, scoring all three of Cardiff's goals in 2\u20131 and 1\u20130 victories. The second fixture also saw Hardy and Smith return after injury layoffs. A much improved run of form ensued with Cardiff losing only one of their following thirteen league matches led by the goals of Davies, Gill and Clennell. Davies also scored the first hat-trick in The Football League by a Cardiff player during a 6\u20133 victory over Bradford City on 21 January 1922.

The team's victory over Blackburn during this spell saw an unusual Football League debutant when club trainer George Latham was forced into action.
