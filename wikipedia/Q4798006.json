As a civil servant he worked for the General Post Office from 1877 to 1919, in increasingly senior posts; he did not seek the highest official positions, preferring to leave himself time and energy for his parallel career as a drama critic. As a journalist he worked with Bernard Shaw on The Star at the beginning of his newspaper career; he is probably best known for his twenty-six years as theatre critic of The Times. He retired from the Post Office in 1919, and for the last six years of his life concentrated wholly on writing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "La Tosca", "response": ["The \"unchaste\" behaviour of the heroine and the violence and brutality depicted in the play, although relatively mild by modern standards, disturbed not only critics at the time, but also some play-goers. The audience's reaction to Tosca's suicide at the American premiere caused Fanny Davenport to change the ending in subsequent performances with the firing squad taking aim at Tosca while she grieves over Cavaradossi's lifeless body, an ending also used by Sarah Bernhardt when she performed the play in Fort Worth, Texas in 1892.Jones (2006) p. 70 William Winter went so far as to warn American women that La Tosca contained scenes which were \"not only shocking to the nervous system and grossly offensive to persons of true sensibility, but which might inflict irreparable injury on persons yet unborn.\"Quoted in Savran (2009) p. 229 Several early critics, including Arthur Bingham Walkley and Jules Lema\u00eetre, wrote at length on Scarpia's graphic description of Cavaradossi's torture and the sound of his off-stage screams in Act 3, which they considered both gratuitously violent and inartistic. However, this was not a view shared by Oscar Wilde, who found the torture scene moving in its depiction of \"a terrible human tragedy\".See Walkley (1892/2009) pp. 86\u201391; Lema\u00eetre (28 November 1887) pp. 136\u2013148; and Mason (1906/2008) p. 441 George Bernard Shaw intensely disliked all of Sardou's work, and not surprisingly characterised La Tosca, which he saw in London in 1890, as a \"clumsily constructed, empty-headed turnip ghost of a cheap shocker\", while presciently suggesting that it would make a good opera.Quoted in Baker (2009)"]}, {"page": "The Admirable Crichton", "response": ["Barrie took the title from the sobriquet of a fellow Scot, the polymath James Crichton, a 16th-century genius and athlete. The epigram-loving Ernest is probably a caricature of the title character in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. The plot may derive from Robinson's Eiland, an 1896 German play by Ludwig Fulda.

The series was written in response to a call for Shaw to write a play based on the Don Juan theme.In his introduction Shaw acknowledges the insistent prompting given by drama critic Arthur Bingham Walkley\u2014 Man and Superman opened at the Royal Court Theatre in London on 23 May 1905, but it omitted the third act. A part of the act, Don Juan in Hell (Act 3, Scene 2), was performed when the drama was staged on 4 June 1907 at the Royal Court. The play was not performed in its entirety until 1915, when the Travelling Repertory Company played it at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh.", "Although Man and Superman can be performed as a light comedy of manners, Shaw intended the drama to be something much deeper, as suggested by the title, which comes from Friedrich Nietzsche philosophical ideas about the \"\u00dcbermensch\" (although Shaw distances himself from Nietzsche by placing the philosopher at the very end of a long list of influences). As Shaw notes in his \"Epistle Dedicatory\" (dedication to theatre critic Arthur Bingham Walkley) he wrote the play as \"a pretext for a propaganda of our own views of life\".Man and Superman dedication The plot centres on John Tanner, author of \"The Revolutionist's Handbook and Pocket Companion\", which is published with the play as a 58-page appendix. Both in the play and in the \"Handbook\" Shaw takes Nietzsche's theme that mankind is evolving, through natural selection, towards \"superman\" and develops the argument to suggest that the prime mover in selection is the woman: Ann Whitefield makes persistent efforts to entice Tanner to marry her yet he remains a bachelor. As Shaw himself puts it: \"Don Juan had changed his sex and become Dona Juana, breaking out of the Doll's House and asserting herself as an individual\".  This is an explicit, intended reversal of Da Ponte's Don Giovanni; here Ann, representing Do\u00f1a Ana, is the predator  \u2014  \"Don Juan is the quarry instead of the huntsman\", as Shaw notes.
