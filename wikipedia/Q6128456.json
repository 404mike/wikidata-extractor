He was the son of James Park, a surgeon from Edinburgh, and was brought up in Edinburgh until his father's practice moved to Surrey. He was educated first at Northampton Grammar School and then at Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar on 18 June 1784 and in 1787 published a successful Treatise on the Law of Marine Insurance, which was reprinted six times during his life. That brought him a good practice, although he was not noticed as a particularly distinguished advocate. In 1791, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and in 1795 became a Recorder of Preston, seen as the first step towards becoming a judge. He became a King's Counsel in 1799, Attorney General of the County Palatine of Durham in 1802 and Attorney-General of Lancaster in 1811. He was made one of the Justices of the Court of Common Pleas on 22 January 1816 and knighted at the same time. He received a DCL from Oxford University in 1834 and died on 8 December 1838, leaving two sons: James Allan Park, who became a priest, and Alexander Atherton Park, who became a barrister.He was said  to bear a striking physical resemblance to King George III, which led to much gossip about his true  paternity. He dismissed all such talk with the remark:  \"King George III was never in Scotland and my mother was never out of Scotland\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northampton School for Boys", "response": ["*Sir James Alan Park, judge"]}, {"page": "James Park", "response": ["*James Alan Park (1763\u20131838), British judge"]}, {"page": "John Ward (prophet)", "response": ["In 1832, Ward and Twort came into conflict with the authorities at Derby. They had posted placards announcing an address on a religious fast day, 15 July. These were torn down three times by a local clergyman, James Dean (d. 1882), whom Twort assaulted. Ward and Twort were subsequently indicted for blasphemy and assault. Tried on 4 August before Sir James Alan Park, Twort was convicted of the assault, and both were found guilty of blasphemy, and sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in Derby Gaol. The case had already become something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, attracting the attention of the radical Richard Carlile, amongst others. On 15 August, Henry Hunt, another political radical and agitator, presented a petition to the House of Commons from 200 citizens of London, expressing \"disgust and indignation\" at the sentence, and praying for the release of Ward and Twort. Hunt made a violent attack on the government for prosecuting opinions; Member of Parliament Joseph Hume spoke in favour of the petition, and the Attorney General opposed. On Hunt's motion, the house was counted out while Alexander Perceval was speaking. No mitigation of the sentence was obtained, but the confinement, as Ward described it, was by no means harsh."]}, {"page": "Charles Molloy (lawyer)", "response": ["It was a standard work on the subject, till superseded by the publications of James Alan Park, Samuel Marshall, and Lord Tenterden."]}, {"page": "George Cambridge (priest)", "response": ["Cambridge was rector of Myland in Essex from 1791 to 1795.A history of Myland Church: Rectors of the Parish of Myland, Essex from the year 1351.
