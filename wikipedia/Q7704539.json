Desouza made an immediate impact, scoring twice on his debut in a 2\u20130 win at Chester City and scoring six goals in his first six appearances. Unfortunately disaster struck as he suffered an injury in training and he only returned on the last day of the season. The goals dried up and a run of eight games without a win saw the side slip out of the play-off chase. A late recovery raised hopes but a 2\u20131 defeat at home to relegation-bound Plymouth Argyle condemned the side to a sixth-place finish. That would normally have been sufficient for a play-off berth but reorganisation of the league meant there was only one automatic promotion spot and the Blues missed out by just three points.", "The summer of 1996 was one of change. Out went the likes of Simon Garner, Steve Thompson, Simon Stapleton, Tony Hemmings and Terry Howard. In came two goalkeepers, Brian Parkin and John Cheesewright and centre-back Paul McCarthy, a \u00a3100,000 capture from Brighton & Hove Albion. The season started in bizarre fashion, in more than one sense. The club had to play its opening game of the season away at Shrewsbury Town on a Sunday due to the town's flower show and the team wore a new pin-striped change shirt, which was christened with a stunning equaliser from Steve Brown to earn a 1\u20131 draw. Alan Smith always had a tough act to follow in O'Neill and after falling-out with popular players, playing a role in the changing of the quartered kit to stripes and disappointing performances he had to get results. But he didn't, and after a start of eight league games without a win, the ninth game, a 6\u20133 defeat by Peterborough United was the final straw and he was sacked. Caretaker boss Neil Smillie helped guide the team to two important wins, over Rotherham United and Notts County but a series of defeats followed which left the side languishing at the bottom of the table. It was something of a surprise when John Gregory, a coach at Aston Villa, was appointed the new boss. He slowly started to turn things around, and the team started winning regularly at home. A first round FA Cup tie with rivals Colchester United at Layer Road added some excitement and goals from Miquel Desouza and one from a suspiciously offside looking John Williams gave the Wanderers a very sweet 2\u20131 victory. Gregory realised the need to strengthen the squad and brought in midfielder Michael Simpson from Notts County for \u00a350,000, Michael Forsyth and Jason Kavanagh from Derby County, for \u00a325,000 each, striker Mark Stallard from Bradford City for \u00a3100,000 and striker Paul Read from Arsenal, also for \u00a3100,000. A first away win of the season was gained with an exciting 4\u20133 victory at Bristol Rovers just before Christmas. The team won eight of its last ten home games, remaining unbeaten at Adams Park. However, away wins proved elusive and the battle to avoid relegation went right to the wire. A pivotal result was secured at home to relegation rivals Shrewsbury Town, and it featured two loanees, goalkeeper Martin Taylor from Derby County and returning striker Keith Scott from Norwich City, making his second debut for the club. Taylor made a number of crucial saves and Scott gave the Wanderers the lead and went to win 3\u20130. A second away win came at Notts County, A long-range opportunist strike from Steve Brown was cancelled out, but a winner from Steve McGavin gave the Blues a 2\u20131 win and condemned County to the drop. It was a great escape and Wycombe had won its first battle against relegation in the Football League."]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final", "response": ["|RB || 2 ||Terry Howard", "|RB || 2 ||Terry Howard"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Terry Howard"]}, {"page": "Terence Howard (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Terry Howard (born 1966), English former footballer"]}]}}
