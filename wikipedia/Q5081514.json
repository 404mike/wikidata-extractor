He played as a goalkeeper.\nPartridge was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire. He played football for Wednesbury Old Athletic before joining Small Heath in 1890. He played two games in Small Heath's second season in the Football Alliance, as a replacement for Chris Charsley and once in their second season in the Football League, replacing George Hollis. In the 1894\u201395 season, the club's first in the First Division, Partridge was first-choice goalkeeper, and had the dubious honour of being in goal for the club's record defeat, 9\u20131, away to Blackburn Rovers in January 1895. He lost his place the following season to Jim Roach, and went on to play for a variety of clubs in the Black Country, Birmingham and north Worcestershire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
