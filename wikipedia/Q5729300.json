The family had long been the principal freeholders in Helston. Henry was educated at Helston grammar school, and resided there all his life. Samuel Drew was his intimate friend. On 24 December 1807 he witnessed the wreck of the frigate Anson in Mount's Bay, when over a hundred lives were lost, and this disaster led him to devote his life and patrimony to the discovery of some means for saving lives at shipwrecks. He spent much labour in attempting to devise a lifeboat, but produced no satisfactory results, and turned his attention to the 'Rocket' life-saving apparatus, an early form of the Breeches buoy.  In addition to this, Trengrouse was dismayed at the then common practice of burying victims of shipwrecks in common graves in unconsecrated ground near the site of the wreck, having seen the dead from the Anson buried in the dunes at Loe Bar.  He persuaded his local MP, Davies Gilbert, to work for a change in the law, and from 1808 the practice was abolished.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Lizard", "response": ["* A 44-gun frigate, , was wrecked at Loe Bar in 1807.

Papers, 1825, xxi.361 The advantages were that the rocket was much lighter and more portable than the mortar; that the cost was much smaller; that there was little risk of the line breaking, because the velocity of a rocket increases gradually, whereas that of a shot fired from a mortar was so great and sudden that the line was frequently broken; the whole of Trengrouse's apparatus could, moreover, be packed in a chest four feet three inches by one foot six inches, and carried by vessels of every size, while Manby contemplated the use of the mortar only on shore, and the safety of the vessel depended therefore on the presence of an apparatus in the vicinity of the wreck.Trans.
