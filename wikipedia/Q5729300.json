The family had long been the principal freeholders in Helston. Henry was educated at Helston grammar school, and resided there all his life. Samuel Drew was his intimate friend. On 24 December 1807 he witnessed the wreck of the frigate Anson in Mount's Bay, when over a hundred lives were lost, and this disaster led him to devote his life and patrimony to the discovery of some means for saving lives at shipwrecks. He spent much labour in attempting to devise a lifeboat, but produced no satisfactory results, and turned his attention to the 'Rocket' life-saving apparatus, an early form of the Breeches buoy.  In addition to this, Trengrouse was dismayed at the then common practice of burying victims of shipwrecks in common graves in unconsecrated ground near the site of the wreck, having seen the dead from the Anson buried in the dunes at Loe Bar.  He persuaded his local MP, Davies Gilbert, to work for a change in the law, and from 1808 the practice was abolished.", "link_mentions": {}}}
