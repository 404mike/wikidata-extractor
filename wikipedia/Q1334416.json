However, the higher level proved a step too far for the club, who finished the 1998\u201399 season bottom of Division Two and were relegated.

Although Davenport was their top scorer in the 1986\u201387 season, he failed to achieve the same success as Hughes and was not a popular figure among fans, even when performing well."]}, {"page": "Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)", "response": ["Having been promoted weeks after the end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990\u201391. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent \u00a3350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took forward Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent \u00a3225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3\u20132 and were relegated back into the Second Division."]}, {"page": "Brian McClair", "response": ["1988\u201389 was a trying season for United after the excellent progress of 1987\u201388. After a season playing alongside Peter Davenport, McClair now found himself paired with returning hero Mark Hughes (back at Manchester United after two years abroad) and much was expected of the newly formed partnership. By the end of November, McClair had scored just twice in the league and Hughes had found the net eight times, with Manchester United finding themselves in mid-table after a run of eight draws and one defeat. Results improved over the next couple of months as United crept to the fringes of the title challenge, but fell away in the final quarter of the season as Manchester United finished 11th. McClair and Hughes both managed 16 goals in all competitions, with Hughes being leading scorer in the league with 14 goals to McClair's 10."]}, {"page": "Norman Whiteside", "response": ["At the start of the 1987\u201388 season, Whiteside represented the Football League in a game against the 'Rest of the World' to celebrate the league's centenary. He formed a solid partnership with new signing Brian McClair, scoring 10 goals in 35 appearances, though United finished second in the league behind Liverpool, and he often found himself back in midfield or on the bench when Peter Davenport was selected to play alongside McClair. However, he felt that he was due a better contract, and decided to 'call the bluff' of the club by handing in a transfer request. Recovering from injury and abuse from some supporters for his transfer request, he put what many United fans call the best performance of his career at Anfield on 4 April 1988, when he came off a substitute with his team 3\u20131 down to help United to salvage a point."]}, {"page": "Alan Brazil", "response": ["Brazil moved to Tottenham Hotspur in March 1983 for \u00a3425,000, scoring six times in 10 appearances. In his only full season at White Hart Lane he scored three goals in 19 games, while his fellow Scot Steve Archibald scored 21 times. Tottenham won the UEFA Cup and Brazil scored four goals during their cup run, however he was not part of the squad for the final. In June 1984 Brazil joined Manchester United for a fee of \u00a3625,000. He stayed with United for two seasons, but a recurring back injury restricted him to a total of 41 appearances in the league, the League Cup, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. Competition for places at Old Trafford was very fierce, with Irish International Frank Stapleton, Mark Hughes and Peter Davenport all in contention. Brazil scored 16 goals during his 18 months with Manchester United, but by the time his second season got underway, he was no longer a regular member of the first team, with most his final appearances for the club coming as a substitute."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C. (1969\u20131986)", "response": ["The 1985\u201386 season started spectacularly for United, who won all of their first ten league matches (a club record start to a season) and were ten points clear at the top of the table as early as October. They were unbeaten from their first 15 matches and it seemed that nothing would stop United from winning their first league title since 1967. However, their form slumped dramatically in the new year, with an injury to Bryan Robson meaning he missed much of the season, and they could only finish in fourth place. The club had decided to sell Mark Hughes against his wishes, and he developed a drinking problem which seriously affected his form before signing for Barcelona in the close season for around \u00a32\u00a0million. The mid-season arrival of new strikers Terry Gibson and Peter Davenport did little to halt United's decline. They had finished 12 points behind champions Liverpool and were also ten points adrift of runners-up Everton, whose top scorer Gary Lineker linked up with Hughes at Barcelona that summer, and eighth points behind a West Ham United side who had emerged as surprise title contenders thanks largely to 26 goals that season from Scottish striker Frank McAvennie."]}, {"page": "Rodney Jack", "response": ["He was offered a contract by Southport manager, Peter Davenport, before returning to his home country to deal with \"family commitments\".

In November, Slaven was dropped from the starting eleven for the trip to face Nottingham Forest, which brought to an end his run of 136 consecutive league appearances. The team struggled in the second half of the 1988\u201389 season, and when Slaven scored both goals in a 2\u20131 win over West Ham United at Upton Park on 11 April he ended the club's run of 11 league games without a victory.
