His father was a local police constable, descended from Gloucestershire emigrants who settled in southeast Ireland around 1670. Tyndall attended the local schools (Ballinabranna Primary School) in County Carlow until his late teens, and was probably an assistant teacher near the end of his time there. Subjects learned at school notably included technical drawing and mathematics with some applications of those subjects to land surveying. He was hired as a draftsman by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland in his late teens in 1839, and moved to work for the Ordnance Survey for Great Britain in 1842. In the decade of the 1840s, a railway-building boom was in progress, and Tyndall's land surveying experience was valuable and in demand by the railway companies. Between 1844 and 1847, he was lucratively employed in railway construction planning.When working for the government's land surveying agency in Lancashire, Tyndall was one of a number of employees who signed a petition calling for higher wages plus some other changes in working conditions. In November 1843, all of the signatories to the petition were dismissed from their jobs. In August 1844, Tyndall was hired by a railway surveying company in Lancashire at almost four times higher pay than the government had been paying him.  Also Eve, A.S. & Creasey, C.H. (1945). Life and Work of John Tyndall.Tyndall was the chief surveyor for the proposed railway line from Halifax to Keighley in 1846, according to Thomas Archer Hirst, who worked under Tyndall at the same engineering firm at the time \u2013 Ref. Tyndall described himself as the \"principal assistant\" at the firm \u2013 ", "The majority of the progressive and innovative British physicists of Tyndall's generation were conservative and orthodox on matters of religion. That includes for example James Joule, Balfour Stewart, James Clerk Maxwell, George Gabriel Stokes and William Thomson \u2013 all names investigating heat or light contemporaneously with Tyndall. These conservatives believed, and sought to strengthen the basis for believing, that religion and science were consistent and harmonious with each other. Tyndall, however, was a member of a club that vocally supported Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and sought to strengthen the barrier, or separation, between religion and science. The most prominent member of this club was the anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Tyndall first met Huxley in 1851 and the two had a lifelong friendship. Chemist Edward Frankland and mathematician Thomas Archer Hirst, both of whom Tyndall had known since before going to university in Germany, were members too. Others included the social philosopher Herbert Spencer."]}, {"page": "University College School", "response": ["* Thomas Archer Hirst, teacher 1860\u20131864.

He returned to England less rich than he might have been but for his scruples against accepting bribes. The tsar offered Edmondson a thousand acres of unreclaimed land at Shushary, which Edmondson declined. In England Edmondson opened a school at Blackburn in 1830, and a little later on one at Tulketh Hall, near Preston. Successful at Tulketh, he was asked to take on Queenwood Hall near Stockbridge, Hampshire, erected by the followers of Robert Owen, with 800 acres of land. In 1847 he set up a science and technical school teaching agriculture. He was one of the early promoters of the College of Preceptors, and vocational training, with a carpenter's and a blacksmith's shop. There was a printing-office, in which a monthly periodical was issued, edited, and at one time set up by the boys. He had several Bradshaws among his school books, in which the boys were examined in finding routes. John Tyndall, Thomas Archer Hirst, Heinrich Debus, and Edward Frankland were among the teachers.
