In 1738 the president of Douai College, Robert Witham, died, and efforts were made by the superiors of the college to have Challoner appointed as his successor. But Bishop Benjamin Petre, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, who already had Challoner as his vicar general, opposed this on the ground that he desired to have him as his own coadjutor with right of succession. The Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide had apparently already arranged Challoner's appointment as President of Douai, but Petre's representations prevailed, and papal briefs were issued on 12 September 1739, appointing Challoner to the see of Debra in partibus."]}, {"page": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster", "response": ["*Benjamin Petre (1734\u20131758)", "*Benjamin Petre (1721\u20131734)"]}, {"page": "Apostolic Vicariate of the London District", "response": ["|align=center|1734 ||align=center|1758 ||Benjamin Petre, O.S.B., Titular Bishop of Prusa ||Appointed coadjutor vicar apostolic on 23 June 1721 and consecrated titular bishop on 11 November 1721.
