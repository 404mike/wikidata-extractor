He was born at Ketton Hall and died at Tolethorpe Hall, both in Rutland.\nEaton was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1849, which was converted to a Master of Arts in 1852. He played first-class cricket in three matches between 1847 and 1853. His first game in 1847 was for a so-called \"England\" eleven that included some of the foremost cricketers of the day; his other first-class matches were for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and he did not play in any important games while at Cambridge University.He was a director of  the Eaton, Cayley & Co. Bank in Stamford (later The Stamford, Spalding and Boston Banking Co.) in which his father Stephen Ormston Eaton (1780\u20131834) had been a partner. His mother Charlotte Anne Eaton (n\u00e9e Waldie), as well as being a published author, carried on the banking business as senior partner after the death of her husband until her own death in 1859. The bank was amalgamated into Barclays in 1911.\nHe was a generous benefactor of the Roman Catholic Church of St Mary and St Augustine, Stamford, purchasing the site and paying for an organ.\nEaton bought the Tolethorpe estate in 1864 and carried out a major reconstruction of the hall and formal gardens. He was also a justice of the peace for Northamptonshire, the Liberty of Peterborough and Rutland, and was Sheriff of Rutland in 1864. He married Elizabeth Jane, daughter of Robert Hedley of Sidbrook, Somerset, in 1858, and their son, Hubert, was also Sheriff of Rutland in 1906.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tolethorpe Hall", "response": ["The estate was purchased in 1864 by Charles Ormston Eaton, of a Stamford banking family, who carried out a major reconstruction of the hall and formal gardens. He added a large wing on the east in the Jacobean style, and another smaller one on the west. The date 1867 appears on brackets of the rainwater heads.

Four bishops participated in the ceremony \u2013 Roskell of Nottingham, Amherst of Northampton, the retired William Wareing and Grant of Southwark, as well as the mitred abbot of Mount St Bernard Abbey in Leicestershire, attended by thirty further clergy.

After the ceremony Charles Ormston Eaton presided over a celebratory lunch at the George Hotel where besides the clergy and the architect, Goldie, other guests included the Marchioness of Lothian, a Lady Fitzgerald and various local dignitaries, before the party returned to church at 3pm for Benediction and a sermon by an eminent Jesuit preacher from London.", "Other fittings include stained glass windows by William Wailes, an associate of Pugin who exhibited at The Great Exhibition, which were installed in St Joseph's chapel in 1873-4, to some acclaim. The organ, by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd, was donated in 1866 by Charles Ormston Eaton and remains in full working order, and the church's bell, a tenor G, was cast by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough and placed in the campanile in 1871.
