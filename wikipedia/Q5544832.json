His brother was the ex-Town player Clem Stephenson.\nAs a player, he spent the period from November 1919 to November 1927 with Aston Villa, before moving on to Derby County. After four seasons at Derby, he moved on to Sheffield Wednesday in 1931. He spent the 1933\u201334 season with Preston North End before spending the last three years of his career with Charlton Athletic where he retired in 1936.\nHe was also an England international, making two appearances in 1928, scoring twice against France on his debut on 17 May 1928. He made his third and final appearance for England on 14 May 1931.\nHis son Bob was also a professional footballer, playing for Derby County, Shrewsbury Town and Rochdale in the 1960s, as well as playing cricket for Derbyshire and Hampshire between 1967 and 1980.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Doherty (footballer)", "response": ["After the conclusion of the war, he transferred to Derby County, with whom he won the FA Cup, scoring a goal in the final itself as Derby beat Charlton Athletic 4\u20131 at Wembley Stadium. In December 1946, Doherty moved to David Steele's Huddersfield Town for a fee of over \u00a39,000 after requesting a transfer. Doherty was unhappy with the directors who opposed his plan to secure his future by taking over the Arboretum Hotel and an earlier dispute over FA Cup Final tickets. The \"Terriers\" boasted a powerful front five of Albert Bateman, Jimmy Glazzard, Alf Whittingham, Doherty and Vic Metcalfe. However a weak defence saw them struggle in the lower reaches of the First Division throughout the 1946\u201347 season, 1947\u201348 and 1948\u201349 seasons. At Leeds Road he scored 33 goals in 83 league appearances, finishing as the \"Terriers\" top-scorer in his final two seasons under George Stephenson."]}, {"page": "Bill McGarry", "response": ["\"Terriers\" manager George Stephenson bought McGarry to play in a defensive partnership with Laurie Kelly. He built a reputation as a tough-tackling, sturdy wing-half, and featured ten times towards the end of the 1950\u201351 season. He then scored twice in 43 games in 1951\u201352, as Huddersfield suffered relegation. New boss Andy Beattie led the club to immediate promotion out of the Second Division with a second-place finish in 1952\u201353. McGarry played all 44 games, in an extremely settled defence that featured himself, Kelly, Don McEvoy, Len Quested, Ron Staniforth, and goalkeeper Jack Wheeler; remarkably, the six men played every minute of the campaign, and had the best defensive record in the Football League with just 33 goals conceded in 42 league games. Town's solid defence then helped them to finish third in the top-flight in 1953\u201354, just six points behind champions Wolverhampton Wanderers; McGarry was again an ever-present, scoring four goals in 43 appearances. He then scored once in 38 games in 1954\u201355, as Town posted a 12th-place finish. He then scored four goals in 41 games in 1955\u201356, as their once solid defence leaked goals and cost them relegation as they finished below 20th place Aston Villa on goal average. Bill Shankly took charge at Leeds Road in November 1956, and took the club to 12th in the Second Division in 1956\u201357; he kept faith with McGarry, who scored twice in 36 appearances. He scored six goals in 36 games in 1957\u201358, as Huddersfield rose slightly to ninth place. His goal tally included a successfully converted penalty in the 7\u20136 defeat to Charlton Athletic at The Valley on 21 December; ten-man Charlton came back from 5\u20131 down in what The Guardian described as \"the most remarkable comeback in football history\". They then dropped down to 14th in 1958\u201359, with McGarry scoring four goals in 32 games. He scored once in 38 games in 1959\u201360; Town posted a sixth-place finish under new boss Eddie Boot, who took charge after Shankly left the club to manage Liverpool. McGarry scored once in 20 appearances in 1960\u201361, as Town dropped down to 20th place."]}, {"page": "List of Derby County F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["!George Stephenson", "* Scoring in successive league matches \u2013 6, joint record, John Goodall (1891-92), Alf Bentley (1909\u201310), Horace Barnes (1913\u201314), George Stephenson (1927\u201328), Jack Bowers (1930\u201331 and 1933\u201334) \u2013 the only Derby player to achieve this twice, Ray Straw (1956\u201357), Eddie Thomas (1964\u201365) \u2013 his first six games for Derby, Francesco Baiano (1997\u201398)"]}, {"page": "George Stephenson (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Stephenson (1781\u20131848) was an English engineer, known as the \"Father of Railways\".", "George Stephenson may also refer to:", "*George Stephenson (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131971), England international footballer, later manager at Huddersfield Town", "*George Stephenson (footballer, born 1865) (1865\u2013?), English footballer for Everton", "*George Stephenson (impresario) (1874\u20131918), New Zealand impresario, auctioneer, rugby footballer (1890s)", "*George Stephenson (rugby union) (1901\u20131970), Ireland international rugby union player, see 1924\u201325 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "*George Stephenson High School, Killingworth, England, named after George Stephenson the inventor"]}, {"page": "List of Preston North End F.C. seasons", "response": ["|George Stephenson"]}]}}
