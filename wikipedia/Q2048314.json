Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Ch\u012bna, used in ancient India. \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Ch\u012bn (), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit C\u012bna ().\"China\". The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (2000).

Although usage in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources.

Looney expelled the play from the canon, arguing that its style and the \"dreary negativism\" it promoted were inconsistent with Shakespeare's \"essentially positivist\" soul, and so could not have been written by Oxford. Later Oxfordians have generally abandoned this argument; this has made severing the connection of the play with the wreck of the Sea Venture a priority amongst Oxfordians. A variety of attacks have been directed on the links. These include attempting to cast doubt on whether the Declaration travelled back to England with Gates, whether Gates travelled back to England early enough, whether the lowly Shakespeare would have had access to the lofty circles in which the Declaration was circulated, to understating the points of similarity between the Sea Venture wreck and the accounts of it, on the one hand, and the play on the other. Oxfordians have even claimed that the writers of the first-hand accounts of the real wreck based them on The Tempest, or, at least, the same antiquated sources that Shakespeare, or rather Oxford, is imagined to have used exclusively, including Richard Eden's The Decades of the New Worlde Or West India (1555) and Desiderius Erasmus's Naufragium/The Shipwreck (1523).Kositsky, Lynne and Roger Stritmatter.\"Dating The Tempest: A Note on the Undocumented Influence of Erasmus' \"Naufragium\" and Richard Eden's 1555 Decades of the New World.\"  The Shakespeare Fellowship. 2005.
