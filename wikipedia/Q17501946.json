He was reinstated by new manager Michael O'Neill and he worked with a new goalkeeping coach, David Rouse which helped him regain some of his form. The season was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and during the lockdown Butland participated in a campaign making phone calls to vulnerable supporters.

After confirming Ross Barkley's stay at the club for at least another month, and capturing ex-Everton young goalkeeper Adam Davies, due to a goalkeeping crisis, Wednesday faced Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. A poor start saw Blackburn take the lead with Grant Hanley scoring from close range. And after dominating large parts of the match and Michail Antonio coming particularly close, Wednesday just could not find the equaliser, or even two goals, of which they deserved. Another loss loomed for Sheffield Wednesday, and although Dave Jones has apparently got chairman Milan Mandaric's support, fans are starting to get worried. The end of the last full week of October saw Sheffield Wednesday face the only other team that was lower than themselves in the division \u2013 Ipswich Town. The game at Portman Road saw the first game for Ipswich Town without Paul Jewell as the manager was sacked earlier on in the week. Unusual compared to the rest of the season so far Sheffield Wednesday had a great start and took the lead after just two-minutes through on-loan youngster Ross Barkley after placing the ball into the net. The Owls continued to be on top for the rest of the half, with Ipswich Town also coming close on a few occasions. The second half saw Wednesday dominate but not seemingly to take their chances, but they did finally double their lead after a great left-footed volley from Ross Barkley, scoring his second of the game. The Owls continued to remain comfortable and with ten-minutes to go Michail Antonio rounded the goalkeeper and made it 0\u20133. Sheffield Wednesday claimed their first away win of the season, and their first win since the end of August. Also, the clean sheet was the first in the league this season, and it was a win that was inevitably coming after the previous few games.", "|Adam Davies", "| Adam Davies"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Adam Davies"]}, {"page": "Adam Davies", "response": ["Adam Davies may refer to:", "*Adam Davies (footballer, born 1987), English-born Welsh football player", "*Adam Davies (footballer, born 1992), German-born Welsh football goalkeeper", "*Adam Davies (cricketer) (born 1980), Welsh cricketer", "*Adam Davies (author), American author", "*Adam Davies (snooker player) (born 1987), British snooker player"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["|Adam Davies", "| Adam Davies"]}]}}
