According to the French Kaskaskia records, the Duff name was recorded as, \"Jean Michel Duff\" and \"John Michael Duff.\"  In 1786, John, Daniel, and another son of Thomas McElduff sold land tracts for two different property deeds.  There was a Daniel McElduff and McDuff who was also at Kaskaskia in the 1780s and was likely the brother of John Duff.  When the McElduffs first arrived, the pre-American Revolution, British-controlled, French-speaking settlement of Kaskaskia was not recorded.  Daniel McDuff owned slaves while residing in Kaskaskia, as was the custom of transplanted Southerners and the French creole population in the Illinois Country. After the departure of the bandit John Dodge, who lived in the area from 1784-1790, John McElduff was elected, in 1790, as one of six judges, to the Kaskaskia town court.  According to the French records, on February 6, 1794, John McElduff and Seddy, his wife, sold a dwelling and grounds in Kaskaskia Village, to J.R. Jones for $200; this Jones may have been John Rice Jones, an Illinois Regiment veteran, noted politician, and the first lawyer in the Illinois Country."]}, {"page": "1824 in Wales", "response": ["*1 February - John Rice Jones, Welsh-born American politician and soldier, 64"]}, {"page": "1809 in Wales", "response": ["**John Rice Jones begins lead mining across the Mississippi in the future state of Missouri."]}, {"page": "1804 in Wales", "response": ["*12 April (in Indiana) - George Wallace Jones, US senator and son of Welsh lawyer John Rice Jones (died 1896)"]}, {"page": "1801 in Wales", "response": ["*John Rice Jones becomes first attorney-general of Indiana."]}, {"page": "List of United States political families (J)", "response": ["* John Rice Jones, Attorney General of Indiana Territory, member of the Missouri Territory Legislature 1814, delegate to the Missouri Constitutional Convention 1820, Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court 1820\u201324.
