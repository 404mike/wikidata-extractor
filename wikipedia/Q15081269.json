Previously he was a Professor of Economic History at London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) between 1995-2005.  He also teaches for the TRIUM Global Executive MBA Program, an alliance of NYU Stern, the LSE and HEC School of Management.  His main fields of interest are the British economy in the last 200 years, European economic growth, historical data on the British economy, the Industrial Revolution and international income distribution, especially with reference to the Human Development Index. He has produced a substantial body of papers for academic journals, the British government and international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.\nDuring the 1980s Crafts argued that during the Industrial Revolution an abnormally high (compared to countries which industrialised later) proportion of the British economy came to be devoted to industry and international trade, and that the British economy always tended to grow slowly. When Britain was overtaken by Germany and the USA - both larger countries - in the late nineteenth century, this was not because of any deceleration of British performance.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Industrial Revolution", "response": ["Some historians, such as John Clapham and Nicholas Crafts, have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and that the term revolution is a misnomer.

(2009) \"The Global Financial Crisis\", The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 5, No. 4 / Vol. 6, No. 1, Autumn 2009/Winter 2010 Keynes's formulation of a liquidity trap refers to the existence of a horizontal demand-curve for money at some positive level of interest rates; yet, the liquidity trap invoked in the 1990s referred merely to the presence of zero or near-zero interest-rates policies (ZIRP), the assertion being that interest rates could not fall below zero.The assumption being that no one would lend 100 dollars unless they were to get at least 100 dollars back, although we have seen in the 21st century the introduction, without any problem in demand, of negative interest-rates. See e.g. \"Why negative interest rates sometimes succeed\" by Gemma Tetlow, Financial Times, 5 September 2016 Some economists, such as Nicholas Crafts, have suggested a policy of inflation-targeting (by a central bank that is independent of the government) at times of prolonged, very low, nominal interest-rates, in order to avoid a liquidity trap or escape from it."]}, {"page": "Economy of Wales", "response": ["The decline in Welsh GDP per person (relative to the UK average) over recent years has prompted policy debate. There have been suggestions \u2013 for example, by Plaid Cymru \u2013 that Wales should attempt to emulate the Irish 'Celtic Tiger' model, particularly its low corporation tax rates, to stimulate investment and growth. However, economists such as Nicholas Crafts and John Bradley have argued that the low Irish corporation tax rate was only effective in the very specific demographic and historical circumstances of Ireland in the late 1980s and 1990s, and that such a policy in Wales' very different economic context would not only require political independence, but could be relatively ineffective and/or require difficult policy choices between higher personal taxes and lower public spending."]}, {"page": "Nicholas F.

Economica (1976): 335\u2013348. It stresses the long-term decline and competitiveness of British industry. During the 1970s especially, the manufacturing sector steadily lost its share of both home and international markets. The historic substantial surplus of exports over Imports slipped into an even balance. That balance is maintained by North Sea oil primarily, and to a lesser extent from some efficiency improvement in agriculture and service sectors. The New Cambridge model posits several different causes for the decline in competitiveness. Down to the 1970s, the model stresses bad delivery times, poor design of products, and general low-quality. The implication is that although research levels are high in Britain, industry has been laggard in implementing innovation. The model after 1979 points to the appreciation of sterling against other currencies, so that British products are more expensive. In terms of policy, the New Cambridge model recommends general import controls, or else unemployment will continue to mount.Francis Cripps, and Wynne Godley, \"Control of imports as a means to full employment and the expansion of world trade: the UK's case\". Cambridge Journal of Economics 2.3 (1978): 327\u2013334. The model indicates that deindustrialisation is a serious problem which threatens the nation's ability to maintain balance of payments equilibrium in the long run. The situation after North Sea oil runs out appears troublesome. De-industrialisation imposes that serious social consequences. Workers skilled in the manufacturing sector are no longer needed, and are shuffled off to lower paying, less technologically valuable jobs. Computerisation and globalisation are compounding that problem.Pick,  What's What in the 1980s (1982), pp. 86\u2013878. Nicholas Crafts attributes the relatively poor productivity growth of the British economy during the postwar period to a mixture of failure to invest and equipment and skills, poor management, insufficient competition, dysfunctional management-labour relations and poor economic policy.Crafts, Nicholas.

Economist Nicholas Crafts attributes Britain's relatively low growth in this period to a combination of a lack of competition in some sectors of the economy, especially in the nationalised industries; poor industrial relations; and insufficient vocational training. He writes that this was a period of government failure caused by poor understanding of economic theory, short-termism, and a failure to confront interest groups."]}, {"page": "List of University of Warwick people", "response": ["* Nicholas Crafts - professor of economics and economic history"]}, {"page": "Mansfield", "response": ["*Nicholas Crafts (born 1949), economic historian "]}, {"page": "Crafts (surname)", "response": ["*Nicholas Crafts (born 1949), British historian"]}, {"page": "Crafts, Nicholas", "response": ["#redirectNicholas Crafts"]}, {"page": "Ian Gazeley", "response": ["* (edited with Nicholas Crafts and Andrew Newell) Work and Pay in Twentieth-Century Britain (Oxford University Press, 2007)."]}, {"page": "Engels' pause", "response": ["British academic economists Charles Harley and Nicholas Crafts analysed the growth rates of industries and economic sectors in Britain during the Industrial Revolution in 1980, estimating per-capita growth at 46 percent between 1780 and 1840.
