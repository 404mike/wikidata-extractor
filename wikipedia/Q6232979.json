He played as a forward for their great team which won the Scottish Cup three times in 1877, 1878 and 1879. In 1878, after doing so, they travelled down to England and beat Wanderers F.C., the FA Cup winners, 3-1. Although an important game in a way, the match was not advertised, and they had not decided beforehand whether to use the Scottish or English throw-in rule.\nHe played for Scotland six times (three times each against England and Wales) and scored a total of five goals.\nIn later years he ran a pub in Kilmarnock.", "link_mentions": {}}}
