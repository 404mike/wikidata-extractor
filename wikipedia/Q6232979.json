He played as a forward for their great team which won the Scottish Cup three times in 1877, 1878 and 1879. In 1878, after doing so, they travelled down to England and beat Wanderers F.C., the FA Cup winners, 3-1. Although an important game in a way, the match was not advertised, and they had not decided beforehand whether to use the Scottish or English throw-in rule.\nHe played for Scotland six times (three times each against England and Wales) and scored a total of five goals.\nIn later years he ran a pub in Kilmarnock.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Ferguson", "response": ["John Ferguson may refer to:", "*John Ferguson (Australian politician) (1830\u20131906), Australian Senator and member of the Queensland Parliament", "*John Ferguson (Canadian politician) (1840\u20131908), Scottish-born farmer, lumberman and political figure in Ontario, Canada", "*John Ferguson (New Brunswick politician) (1813\u20131888), merchant and Canadian senator from New Brunswick", "*John Ferguson (New South Wales politician) (1903\u20131969), member of the New South Wales Legislative Council", "*John Ferguson (New York politician) (died 1832), Mayor of New York City", "*John Ferguson (Northern Ireland politician) (1911\u2013?), UUP and Alliance Party politician", "*John Ferguson (Ontario politician) (1839\u20131896), physician and Canadian MP and senator from Ontario", "*John Ferguson (Scottish activist), Irish born, late 19th century Scottish Labour Party activist", "*John Ferguson (Conservative politician) (1870\u20131932), British Conservative MP", "*John Ferguson (Upper Canada politician) (1756\u20131830), judge and politician in Upper Canada", "*John Ferguson (Western Australian politician) (1841\u20131924), member of the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia", "*John Ferguson Sr. (1938\u20132007), Canadian ice hockey player", "*John Ferguson Jr. (born 1967), former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League", "*John Ferguson (curler) (born 1958), Canadian curler", "*John Ferguson (footballer, born 1848) (1848\u20131929), Scottish international footballer", "*John Ferguson (footballer, born 1891) (1891\u20131916), Scottish footballer", "*John Ferguson (footballer, born 1904) (1904\u20131973), English footballer (Wolverhampton Wanderers, Manchester United)", "*John Ferguson (footballer, born 1931), Australian rules footballer for Melbourne and South Melbourne", "*John Ferguson (footballer, born 1949), Australian rules footballer for Richmond", "*John Ferguson (rugby league) (born 1954), Indigenous Australian rugby league footballer", "*John Ferguson (sailor) (born 1944), Australian sailor", "*John Ferguson (sportscaster) (1919\u20132005), American sportscaster", "*John Ferguson (Ferguson bequest) (1787\u20131856), Scottish businessman and philanthropist.

They had a goal disallowed after scoring directly from a corner kick, before taking the lead after 40 minutes through John Ferguson. In the early stages of the second half, Wales attempted to play more openly to find a goal, but the Scottish side took advantage of their opponent's inexperience and scored two further goals. The first was a rebound off the goalpost which was converted by Billy MacKinnon; the second was headed in by debutant James Lang. Scotland added a fourth through Henry McNeil and claimed a victory in front of a crowd of around 17,000 people, a record for an international fixture at the time. ", "Scotland captain Charles Campbell won the coin toss and choose to play \"downhill\" as the ground featured a slight incline. This was perceived as advantageous to the attacking side, but their choice meant they started the match with the sun in their faces. The Welsh captain Kenrick kicked off the match at 3:40p.m. The Scots gained possession almost immediately and proceeded to attack the Welsh goal as John Ferguson won the first corner of the game after making a run down the wing, but the resulting setpiece was cleared without incident. Wales were forced to defend resolutely; the North Wales Chronicle noted that \"the Welsh defended their goal in such a compact and determined way that the ball could not be passed through them.\" William Evans was called on early on to \"save the fortress\" by intercepting a pass and sending the ball upfield. The Welsh players were unable to break out of their own half as the game progressed and their forwards' passing game was described as \"not much understood\", while David Thomson in the Welsh goal made his first save soon after with a comfortable catch. The Welsh side's strongest play of the first half came from a Scottish corner when the ball fell to Kenrick who beat several opposition players to break into the Scottish half before being chased down by Sandy Kennedy. Kenrick was able to pass to Edwards but he was quickly dispossessed by the defenders.
