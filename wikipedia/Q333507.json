Though Chamberlain's initial parliamentary response was, according to biographer Nick Smart, \"feeble,\" within 48\u00a0hours he had spoken more forcefully against the German aggression. In another Birmingham speech, on 17 March, Chamberlain warned that Hitler was attempting to \"dominate the world by force\" and that \"no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made.\" The Prime Minister questioned whether the invasion of Czechoslovakia was \"the end of an old adventure, or the beginning of a new\" and whether it was \"a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force.\" Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald said, \"whereas the Prime Minister was once a strong advocate of peace, he has now definitely swung around to the war point of view.\" This speech was met with widespread approval in Britain and recruitment for the armed services increased considerably."]}, {"page": "Ramsay MacDonald", "response": ["Ramsay MacDonald married Margaret Ethel Gladstone (no relation to Prime Minister William Gladstone) in 1896.

Another son, Alister Gladstone MacDonald (1898\u20131993) was a conscientious objector in the First World War, serving in the Friends' Ambulance Unit; he became a prominent architect who worked on promoting the planning policies of his father's government, and specialised in cinema design. MacDonald was devastated by Margaret's death from blood poisoning in 1911, and had few significant personal relationships after that time, apart from with Ishbel, who acted as his consort while he was Prime Minister and cared for him for the rest of his life.
