His report was never published but partly reused by Montgomery Martin later. Kishore Kunal examined the original report in the British Library archives. It states that the Hindus generally attributed destruction \"to the furious zeal of Aurangzabe\". However it said that the mosque at Ayodhya was ascertained to have been built by Babur by \"an inscription on its walls\". The said inscription in Persian was said to have been copied by a scribe and translated by a Maulvi friend of Buchanan. The translation however contained five pieces of text, including two inscriptions. The first inscription said that the mosque was constructed by Mir Baqi in the year 935\u00a0AH or 923\u00a0AH. The second inscription narrated the genealogy of Aurangzeb. In addition to the two inscriptions and their monograms (turghas), a fable concerning a dervish called Musha Ashiqan was also included. The translator doubted that the fable was part of the inscription but recorded that the scribe \"positively says that the inscription was executed at the erection of this building\". The translator also had a difficulty with the anagram for the date, because one of the words was missing, which would have resulted in a date of 923 AH rather than 935 AH. These incongruities and mismatches made no impression on Buchanan, who maintained that the mosque was built by Babur."]}, {"page": "Brahmaputra River", "response": ["In 1809, Francis Buchanan-Hamilton wrote that the new channel between Bhawanipur and Dewanranj \"was scarcely inferior to the mighty river, and threatens to sweep away the intermediate country\". By 1830, the old channel had been reduced to its present insignificance. It was navigable by country boats throughout the year and by launches only during rains, but at the point as low as Jamalpur it was formidable throughout the cold weather.

Alexander Cunningham and the newly formed Archaeological Survey of India conducted an official survey in 1861\u20131862. Systematic excavation of the ruins by the ASI did not begin until 1915 and ended in 1937. The first four excavations were led by Spooner between 1915 and 1919. The next two were led by Sastri in 1920 and 1921. The next seven seasons of archaeological excavations through 1928 were led by Page. These efforts were not merely digging, observation and cataloging of discoveries, they included conservation, restoration and changes to the site such as drainage to prevent damage to unearthed floors. After 1928, Kuraishi led two seasons of excavations, Chandra led the next four. The last season was led by Ghosh, but the excavations were abbreviated in 1937 for financial reasons and budget cuts. Chandra and final ASI team leaders noted that the \"long row of monasteries extend further into the modern village of Bargaon\" and the \"extent of entire monastic establishment can only be determined by future excavations\".Mary Stewart (1988), Nalanda Mahavihara: An Historiographic Study of Its Art and Archaeology, 1812\u20131938, SOAS, University of London, pp. 120\u2013177", "After its decline, Nalanda was largely forgotten until Francis Buchanan-Hamilton surveyed the site in 1811\u20131812 after locals in the vicinity drew his attention to a vast complex of ruins in the area.

He had 700 illustrations by 1790. He then succeeded Patrick Russell (1727\u20131805) as Naturalist to the Madras Government in April 1789.

Wallich went on extended leave in 1828 to supervise the printing and hand-colouring of the illustrations in England. Foremost of the watercolour artists who executed the original paintings were two Indian artists, Vishnupersaud, responsible for 114 plates and Gorachand for 87. Vishnupersaud (occasionally referred to as Vishnu Prasad) was an Indian artist frequently employed by naturalists working in India, such as John Forbes Royle and Francis Buchanan-Hamilton.  Vishnupersaud\u2019s skill was legendary and Wilfrid Blunt included one of his watercolours in his book The Art of Botanical Illustration as displaying great craftsmanship. The remaining plates were done by Charles M. Curtis (7), William Griffith (3), Sarah Drake, and various others.
