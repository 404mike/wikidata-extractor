The pyramid is topped by a funerary shrine, containing finely carved wooden lintels, the execution of which probably was overseen by Jasaw Chan K'awiil as part of his plans for his funerary monument. The lintels were carved from sapodilla wood and one of them, Lintel 3, once was painted red.Coe 1962, p.494. Coe 1967, 1988, p.29. Sapodilla (Manilkara zapota) is a very hard red-brown wood available locally.Coe 1967, 1988, p.29. The lintels were formed from planks of this wood set into small niches fashioned into the walls forming the three doorways; the outermost lintel was smooth, but the central lintel was carved intricately from four planks. Two of these planks were removed in the nineteenth century and their location now is unknown. The other two were removed by the British explorer John Boddam-Whetham and donated to the British Museum in London.British Museum Collection (1). British Museum Collection (2). Website of Tikal National Park The scene carved onto one lintel shows a seated figure with an enormous serpent rising above him."]}, {"page": "Kirklington, Nottinghamshire", "response": ["*John Boddam-Whetham (1843\u20131918), cricketer and naturalist"]}, {"page": "Boddam-Whetham, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Boddam-Whetham"]}, {"page": "Whetham", "response": ["*John Boddam-Whetham (1843\u20131918), English naturalist and cricketer"]}]}}
