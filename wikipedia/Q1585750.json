Maurice's girlfriend, Vera Parkinson, was played by Rosemary Martin in the first series. In the second and third series (during which Maurice and Vera marry), Vera was played by Lynda Baron. A running gag is Froggitt's mother saying \"Don't open that cupboard our Selwyn, things fall out!\" whenever he opens the cupboard in the Froggitt front room, before objects fall from it. Froggitt is on the committee of his local working men's club, serving as concert secretary in charge of booking \"turns\". Froggitt's colleagues on the committee are the dour Scouser Jack (Bill Dean), Harry (Harold Goodwin) and excitable, stereotypical Welshman Clive (Richard Davies), often referred to as Taff by Selwyn. All decisions taken by the club committee are taken on a \"show of hands...\" and \"carried unanimously\". In keeping with the A Midsummer Night's Dream characterisations, Maynard saw the committee as the mechanicals. Froggitt is incompetent at everything he turns his hand to, being equally inept at his day job (digging holes and filling them in), do-it-yourself at home, and booking acts for the club. Nevertheless, he is honest and hard-working, unlike the other committee members, who usually sit back in comfort while Froggitt does the manual labour. They generally tolerate him because he is prepared to volunteer for unwanted tasks. Barman at the club is Raymond (Ray Mort), often seen answering the telephone with a number of highly fictitious and fanciful addresses."]}, {"page": "Harold Goodwin (American actor)", "response": ["Harold Goodwin (December 1, 1902 \u2013 July 12, 1987) was an American actor who performed in over 225 films."]}, {"page": "The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb", "response": ["*Harold Goodwin: Fred, one of Alexander King's workmen"]}, {"page": "Don't Raise the Bridge, Lower the River", "response": ["* Harold Goodwin as Six-Eyes Wiener"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["*Harold Goodwin (Acting Diploma 1947)"]}, {"page": "That's My Boy (1981 TV series)", "response": ["*Harold Goodwin \u2013 Wilfred Willis", "When Ida Willis (Mollie Sugden) gets a new job as housekeeper to Robert Price (Christopher Blake) and his wife Angie (Jennifer Lonsdale), she moves into their London flat and soon discovers that Robert is the son she gave up for adoption when he was a baby, and she proceeds to call him Shane, the name she gave him when he was born.
