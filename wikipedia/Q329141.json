Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance.Burrows (1991), p. 99 The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \"incorruptible\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\".Luckett, p. 191 After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \"O death, where is thy sting?\"  The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata , and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings.

It is remarked that Hubert Robert was the architect. Completed by 1778 with care and craft, the garden came to resemble a natural environment, almost a wilderness, appearing untouched by any human intervention.

The Windsors came originally from the south, holding the ancient barony of Windsor. They claimed descent from Walter FitzOther, first Constable of Windsor Castle during the reign of William the Conqueror. The Victoria County History records that Andrew, Lord Windsor, was obliged by Henry VIII to exchange his historic manor at Stanwell, near Windsor, for the Bordesley Abbey estate, and did so \u201cmuch against his will\u201d. By the 17th century, Thomas Hickman-Windsor had been elevated to the Earldom of Plymouth. His grandson, Other Windsor, 2nd Earl of Plymouth, commissioned a country house at Tardebigge which was built around 1711\u20131712. It has been attributed to Francis Smith of Warwick or his brother William and was redesigned by Thomas Cundy in 1815\u20131816. The surrounding estate was landscaped, firstly on the advice of William Shenstone, then by Capability Brown and lastly by Humphry Repton. "]}]}}
