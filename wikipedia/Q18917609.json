These poems dealt with the Highland clearances, and described the Scottish landscape in rich detail, using Gaelic assonances. He was one of the first to succeed in rendering the qualities of Gaelic poetry in English. These poems and verse plays won praise from many Scottish writers\u00a0\u2013 Naomi Mitchison, Norman MacCaig, Edwin Muir, Compton Mackenzie, George Bruce, Sydney Goodsir Smith, Maurice Lindsay, and many more. Macleod's \"Drinan\" poetry was in much demand in both England and Scotland, as well as Ireland and the US. Editors such as Tambimuttu (of Poetry (London)), Maurice Lindsay (Poetry (Scotland)) and John Lehmann (Hogarth Press and New Writing), all requested and published many of his poems in the 1940s. Both \"Drinan\" and Macleod are included in Kenneth Rexroth's New British Poets anthology (1949), published for New Directions. The \"Drinan\" pseudonym was not publicly revealed until 1953, after which Hugh MacDiarmid commented it was \"so long one of the best-kept secrets of the contemporary literary world\".Hugh MacDiarmid.
