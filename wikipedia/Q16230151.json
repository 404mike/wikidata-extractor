Derby offered Jacobs a contract, which was accepted. As Jacobs was under 24, Northampton were entitled to compensation, either agreed by the two clubs or set by a tribunal. Derby and Northampton agreed an undisclosed fee for the out-of-contract player and Jacobs joined Derby on a three-year contract. The club also were rumoured to be interested in Sheffield United right-back Matthew Lowton although the club denied interest in Lowton, who later joined Aston Villa. Wigan Athletic striker Conor Sammon, who the club had missed out on in January 2011, was also a target for the club. Derby also turned down two bids in excess of \u00a31 million in June for defender Jason Shackell, both believed to be from Burnley and two more bids from further Championship clubs, with one thought to be Cardiff City. However the club later accepted a bid for Shackell from Burnley of \u00a31.1 million and he transferred to Burnley, signing a four-year contract with the Clarets. Attention immediately turned to who Derby would sign as a replacement, with out-of-contract Nottingham Forest defender Joel Lynch the first target. The club spoke to Lynch but denied rumours that he had undergone a medical with them and he opted to sign for Huddersfield Town instead. Coventry City centre-half Richard Keogh, already attracting from Leeds United and bids from Bristol City and Cardiff City, which were rejected, was the next defender the club was linked to, Keogh later joined the club on a three-year contract, with striker Callum Ball loaned out to Coventry for the season. Nigel Clough said that although Derby may be outbid for players, they would be able to offer \"the chance to be a part of what we think is a very exciting young side\". At the same time, the club announced that eighteen-year-old former Bolton Wanderers winger James Caton had begun training with them. Other defenders Derby were linked to following Shackell's departure were Bristol city defender James Wilson, Leeds United left-back Aidan White, out-of-contract Dundee United centre-half Garry Kenneth, Cardiff City centre-half Anthony Gerrard and Sunderland centre-half John Egan. Derby offered out-of-contract Crewe Alexandra left-back Kelvin Mellor a three-year contract after Crewe only offered the player a one-year deal, but after extensive talks with Derby Mellor turned down Derby's offer after Crewe offered the player a two-year contract which he signed in July. An angry Nigel Clough hit out at Mellor saying \"It must be difficult for him going back to the dressing room after all the things he said to us. And then when everyone was starting back for pre-season he decided to go to Ibiza with his mates for five days.\" Derby made an enquiry for Preston North End outcast Paul Coutts. After the enquiry was accepted, Derby started talks with Coutts and the Scot joined the club on a three-year contract for a reported fee of \u00a3150,000.
