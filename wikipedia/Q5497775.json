Herbert was known for his work with horses, wrote parts of the books by Sir Frederick Fitzwygram, and was involved in the design of the so-called Fitzwygram shoe. James studied Veterinary Science at William Dick's Veterinary College on Clyde Street in Edinburgh. In 1866 following the death of William Dick he served as principal of the college on an interim basis until the autumn of 1867 when he was replaced on a permanent basis by Prof William Williams. He joined the Bombay Veterinary Service in 1850 and then served with the 1st Bombay Lancers until 1855, followed by Remount purchasing until 1858 after which he was in the Bombay Horse Artillery. In 1862 he was made Inspecting Veterinary Surgeon and was involved in establishing the veterinary service, and the Army Veterinary School, Poona. He started a school for  (horse attendants) and castrators at Babugarh in the United Provinces in 1877. This was moved to Lahore in 1882 under Colonel G. Kettlewell and became the Punjab Veterinary College in 1900. He served in the Abyssinian War (1867-68) and was in charge of 50000 animals including cavalry and transport.  He was recommended a medal by Lord Napier for his services but a C.B. could not be conferred as veterinary surgeons were ineligible. In 1868 he was dispatched to Bombay to deal with a sudden outbreak of cattle plague in India. He was placed in charge of a Special Stud Commission from 16 December 1872 to 31 March 1876 under the Viceroy. This was in response to  Lord Northbrook's policy to breed horses and mules in India rather than import them from Australia and Persia as was the previous practice. Similar suggestions may have also been made during the time of Lord Mayo. Hallen also promoted the use of mares instead of oxen for ploughing. He was involved in the establishment of a civil veterinary department for which he was created a C.I.E. He retired as Inspector General of the Civil Veterinary Department. His examination of the outbreak of rinderpest led to the establishment of the Imperial bacteriological laboratory at Mukteshwar under Alfred Lingard."]}, {"page": "George Webbe (cricketer, born 1854)", "response": ["He made a second appearance in first-class cricket in 1878, for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Kent at Canterbury, in which he batted twice and was dismissed in the MCC first innings for 9 runs by William Foord-Kelcey and was unbeaten in their second innings on 19. As a cricketer, he was described in Scores and Biographies as \"a really good batsman,an energetic field at cover-point\". Scores and Biographies speculated that if Webbe continued in the game that he would \"perhaps excel\". However, his 1878 appearance would be his last in first-class cricket. He was aide-de-camp to the Inspector-General of Cavalry at Aldershot Garrison, Sir Frederick Fitzwygram, from 1879 to 1884. He gained the rank of captain in October 1882, with his retirement from active service following in March 1886. Webbe later served as a Deputy lieutenant of Aberdeen, to which he was appointed in March 1888. Webbe died in February 1925 at Ascot. His brothers were A. J. and Herbert Webbe, who were also first-class cricketers. He was survived by his wife, Lady Cecilia Leila Hay, daughter of William Hay, 19th Earl of Erroll.Peer Bereaved.
