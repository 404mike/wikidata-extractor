Oblong in shape, Burl described it as being \"slab-like\". In total, it measures 1.22m in length, 0.60m in width, and varies between 0.29 and 0.38m in thickness; approximately 58cm of its length is visible above ground level. Like the other stones at Nine Ladies it is of millstone grit. It juts into the ground at an angle, leaning heavily to the south-east.  It is possible that this stone was once part of an avenue that connected with the stone circle, although an excavation around it in 2000 found no evidence that any other stones stood in the immediate vicinity. The King Stone may not be a prehistoric feature, and there is no definite evidence that it was ever designed to be linked in any way to the Nine Ladies circle. The King Stone has been scratched with graffiti; it has the name of \"Bill Stumps\" engraved onto it, alongside a cross and a zero, apparently carved in the 19th century. Bill Stumps is the name of a conman in Charles Dickens' novel The Pickwick Papers, and it is possible that the graffiti deliberately references him. One possible culprit for the graffiti is Edward Simpson, the seller of fake antiquities who often stayed nearby."]}, {"page": "Sleights", "response": ["The Horticultural & Industrial Society show has been held each year since 1880.
