By 1886 this had been extended on both sides.  This group of buildings is still at the core of the school. In the period between the world wars the buildings were extended westward along Cheam Road, and in 1932 Suffolk House was acquired. The assembly hall was built in 1935, linking Suffolk House to the existing buildings. In 1930 Homestead House in the parallel Grove Road was acquired, to be followed by Hayes House and its neighbour, so that the school's grounds extended between the two streets. The Library was built in 1938, to the south of the core, and in 1959 the Lilian Charlesworth Room, named after a retiring headmistress, was added above it. Lilian Charlesworth had led the school from 1939. A new science and language block was opened in 1971 and a swimming pool in 1972.  In the 1990s a new \"Garden Building\" was built, and the former Dene Hotel was bought and converted into a sixth form unit."]}, {"page": "Streatham and Clapham High School", "response": ["* Lilian Charlesworth, leading headteacher and internationalist"]}]}}
