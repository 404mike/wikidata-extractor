He is also capable of playing at right-back. A product of the Arsenal Academy who came to prominence during the 2008\u201309 FA Youth Cup, Eastmond made ten first team appearances between 2009 and 2013 for Arsenal in the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Champions League.\nEastmond had three loan spells away from the Gunners. He joined Millwall on loan in 2011, with whom he spent some of his early youth career. He was loaned to Wycombe Wanderers and Colchester United in 2012, and signed for Colchester on a permanent basis in 2013 following the expiry of his contract with Arsenal. He made over 50 appearances for Colchester before his release in February 2015.\nAs a player at Sutton United, in 2016-17 Eastmond was part of only the 9th non-League side to reach the 5th round of the FA Cup since 1945, and in 2020-21 was captain as the club won the National League and promotion to the English Football League for the first time in its 123-year history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battersea", "response": ["*Craig Eastmond \u2013 footballer"]}, {"page": "Sutton United F.C.", "response": ["Sutton were ranked 15th when the 2019\u201320 season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

He had got himself onto the end of a rebound after Carlos Vela's shot was saved. He became the 85th debut goalscorer for Arsenal, the fifth under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's reign, behind Thomas Vermaelen, Emmanuel Adebayor, Freddie Ljungberg and Samir Nasri. He also featured in Arsenal's League Cup fourth round victory over Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium on 28 October, replacing Nicklas Bendtner after 76 minutes, and featured as a substitute once again in their 3\u20130 defeat to Manchester City on 2 December, replacing Craig Eastmond after 68 minutes. He signed an extended contract with the club in November 2009, and went on to score five goals in ten reserve games for the club during the remainder of the season. After his loan spells away from the club, Watt again signed a contract extension with Arsenal in October 2011, having scored five times in six reserve appearances in the 2011\u201312 season.", "Watt, alongside Arsenal teammate Craig Eastmond, signed for League One club Colchester United on 27 September 2012, both on a three-month loan deal. They both signed alongside MK Dons striker Jabo Ibehre on the same day that Joe Dunne was appointed manager for the Essex club. Watt made his debut on 29 September in Colchester's 3\u20131 victory against Hartlepool United at the Colchester Community Stadium.", "On 30 May 2013, Arsenal announced that Watt was one of ten young professional players that would be leaving the club when their contracts expire on 30 June. Colchester United assistant manager Mark Kinsella confirmed that the former U's loanee was a target, with the club having already signed his former Arsenal teammate Craig Eastmond. On 28 June, Watt's transfer to Colchester was made permanent, signing a two-year contract with the Essex outfit. Following an injury sustained during a pre-season win against Maldon & Tiptree, Watt made his second debut for Colchester in a League Cup clash with Peterborough United on 6 August, coming on as a substitute for Alex Gilbey on 65 minutes as the U's succumbed to a heavy 5\u20131 home defeat. He then made his first league start of the season in a 1\u20130 win against Port Vale four days later. Watt was plagued by a troublesome ankle injury over the first few weeks of the season, and despite using an ice machine in an attempt to heal the issue, he became one of a number of players facing the treatment table as the first-team suffered an injury crisis. He was on the verge of a comeback in early October 2013 following a thigh injury that had kept him out of action, but was dealt a further blow with a quad injury that would rule him out for at least a further six weeks. He returned to training in early December, and finally returned to action on 26 December. He appeared as a substitute during Colchester's biggest win under Joe Dunne, a 4\u20130 win against Stevenage. Watt bagged an assist for himself in the process, setting up Craig Eastmond with a simple pass 13 minutes from time to round off the scoring. He scored his first goal of the season in an instrumental display against Gillingham on 11 January 2014, securing the opening goal in a 3\u20130 home victory. In the next match against Carlisle United, he netted a brace in the 4\u20132 win at Brunton Park on 18 January. Watt was sent off on his birthday for a second bookable offence when the U's visited Swindon Town in a 0\u20130 draw. The ensuing ban left Watt out of first-team action until 4 March, when he returned for Colchester's home fixture against high-flying Rotherham United. In the match, he hit the bar and had a goal disallowed after Clinton Morrison was judged to have fouled Millers goalkeeper Adam Collin. He ended the 2013\u201314 campaign with 23 appearances and three goals to his name."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": [" The club travelled to Victoria Park to face Hartlepool United four days later, playing out a 0\u20130 draw. Another 0\u20130 draw followed three days later, on 20 March, as Stevenage played out a goalless draw against Colchester United at Broadhall Way. Stevenage played the second-half with ten men, after striker Jordan Slew was sent-off just before the interval for \"lashing out\" at Colchester midfielder Anthony Wordsworth. An away trip to the Bescot Stadium to play Walsall on 24 March followed, ending in a 1\u20131 draw. The home side took an early lead when Walsall defender Andy Butler turned in area and found the bottom right hand corner of the goal. Stevenage equalised on the hour mark, Jennison Myrie-Williams made room down the left wing, before his attempted cross was blocked, the ball fell into the path of Michael Bostwick who curled the ball into the net from 25\u00a0yards out. A seventh draw in eight games was played out three days later, with Stevenage drawing 2\u20132 at home with Bournemouth. All four goals came in the first half of the match, with Bournemouth taking a two-goal lead before two Stevenage goals within the space of seven minutes meant the teams went into the break level. The visitors opened the scoring through Wesley Thomas' half volley that found the top right corner of the goal. Bournemouth then doubled their advantage when Scott Malone made a bursting run from full back before hitting a rasping drive that found the net from the edge of the area. The hosts were looking second best, but reduced the two-goal deficit when Luke Freeman cut in from the left and curled a right footed shot past Bournemouth goalkeeper Darryl Flahavan from 25\u00a0yards. Michael Bostwick scored his second goal in as many games with a low struck effort from the edge of the area, ensuring the two sides went in level at the interval. Another draw followed when Stevenage drew 1\u20131 at home to Wycombe Wanderers. Stevenage took the lead with just ten minutes remaining, Michael Bostwick scoring his third goal in as many games when he made room for himself outside the area after a neat interchange with Scott Laird, before curling an effort that beat Nikki Bull in the Wycombe goal. The away side equalised deep into injury-time when Mark Roberts was adjudged to have halted Craig Eastmond's run into the area illegally; Grant Basey stepped up and converted the resultant penalty."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|Craig Eastmond"]}]}}
