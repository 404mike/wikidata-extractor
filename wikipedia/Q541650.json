Though born in London, Woodruff spent his youth in Australia, where he earned degrees in electrical engineering and medicine. Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp. While there, he devised an ingenious method of extracting nutrients from agricultural wastes to prevent malnutrition among his fellow POWs.\nAt the conclusion of the war, Woodruff returned to England and began a long career as an academic surgeon, mixing clinical work and research. Woodruff principally studied transplant rejection and immunosuppression.  His work in these areas of transplantation biology led Woodruff to perform the first kidney transplant in the United Kingdom, on 30 October 1960. For this and his other scientific contributions, Woodruff was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1968 and made a Knight Bachelor in 1969. Although retiring from surgical work in 1976, he remained an active figure in the scientific community, researching cancer and serving on the boards of various medical and scientific organisations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 3", "response": ["*  1911   \u2013 Michael Woodruff, English-Scottish surgeon and academic (d. 2001)"]}, {"page": "2001", "response": ["* March 10 \u2013 Michael Woodruff, British surgeon and organ transplantation pioneer (b. 1911)"]}, {"page": "1911", "response": ["** Michael Woodruff, British/Australian surgeon (d. 2001)"]}, {"page": "1960", "response": ["* October 30 \u2013 Dr. Michael Woodruff carries out the first successful kidney transplant in the United Kingdom, at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary."]}, {"page": "1911 in science", "response": ["* April 3 \u2013 Michael Woodruff (died 2001), English pioneer of organ transplant surgery."]}, {"page": "1960 in science", "response": ["* October 30 \u2013 The first kidney transplantation in the United Kingdom is performed by a team led by English surgeon Michael Woodruff at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh between identical twins."]}, {"page": "Changi Prison", "response": ["* Sir Michael Woodruff, surgeon and scientist."]}, {"page": "2001 in Australia", "response": ["* 10 March \u2013 Sir Michael Woodruff, surgeon and scientist (born and died in the United Kingdom) (b. 1911)"]}, {"page": "Kidney transplantation", "response": ["In 1955, Charles Rob, William James \"Jim\" Dempster (St Marys and Hammersmith, London) carried out the first deceased donor transplant in United Kingdom, which was unsuccessful.
