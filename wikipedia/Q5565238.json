The club's form stuttered, falling out of contention for automatic promotion and very nearly even the play-offs as well, but this time the club were able to rebound and secure a 4th-place finish, setting up a play-off semi final with the side directly above them, Shrewsbury Town. This was taken to penalties after a 2\u20132 aggregate score (Barnet won 2\u20131 at Underhill, Shrewsbury won 1\u20130 at Gay Meadow), with Shrewsbury winning 5\u20133 on penalties. The following season, 2004\u201305, with Fairclough at the helm, the Bees went one better than the previous season and were crowned Champions of the Conference Premier and regained their football league status, after amassing an impressive 86 points in the season, and scoring 90 goals with it.

He was then succeeded by Martin Allen, who was asked to manage Barnet on a non-contract basis until the end of the season; however, after just 3 matches, he was offered a contract from Notts County and subsequently left for them. With just 5 games left of the season, assistant manager Giuliano Grazioli took over, having been appointed as Assistant manager by Martin Allen earlier. Grazioli was also able to bring in Lawrie Sanchez as an adviser. Grazioli took Barnet to the last day of the season 2 points behind Lincoln City in the relegation zone. Barnet were up against Port Vale in their final match on 7 May 2011 at Underhill and were able to win 1\u20130 following a penalty scored by Izale McLeod. Aldershot Town's 3\u20130 victory over Lincoln City meant Barnet finished a point above Lincoln City and the relegation zone.

The following season, the club reached the Fourth Round where they drew Premier League club Newcastle United at Broadhall Way. A temporary stand was erected behind the South Stand, allocated to the Newcastle supporters, which increased the stadium capacity to 9,000, enough to satisfy The FA. Stevenage held Newcastle to a 1\u20131 draw, with Giuliano Grazioli equalising after Alan Shearer had given Newcastle an early lead. Stevenage lost 2\u20131 in the replay at St James' Park, a controversial goal from Alan Shearer that \"appeared to not cross the line\" proved the difference.

Fairclough's side produced some excellent performances both at Underhill and on the road, including the 3\u20131 victory over promotion rivals Carlisle United in mid-October, watched by a then-record Conference crowd of 9,215.
