He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Castle Point in Essex from 1992 to 1997, and from 2001 to 2010.\nSpink was elected as the Conservative Party MP for Castle Point in 1992, lost his seat in 1997, but regained it in 2001.

It was opposed by the DUP and the UUP. Conservative Party MPs were split on the issue, and the party leadership did not issue a whip mandating MPs to take a particular stance on the Bill, instead allowing its MPs a free vote. This decision was described by some in the British media as an attempt to demonstrate a shift to a more inclusive, centrist approach under the leadership of Michael Howard, and as a departure from the alleged active opposition to LGBT rights under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. As party leader, Duncan Smith had imposed a three-line whip against the Adoption and Children Bill, mandating all Conservative MPs to vote against extending adoption rights to same-sex couples. Conservative MPs split 67 in favour to 37 against at the second reading, and 43 in favour to 39 against at the third reading. High-profile Conservative MPs who voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill included Iain Duncan Smith, Ann Widdecombe, Bob Spink and Peter Lilley. Those who voted in favour included David Cameron, George Osborne and party leader Michael Howard. Around 30 Conservative MPs did not participate in any of the votes."]}, {"page": "Campaign for an Independent Britain", "response": ["CIB's president is George West, who replaced long serving co-presidents Sir Richard Body, a former Conservative MP, and Baron Stoddart of Swindon both of whom retired in 2011.
