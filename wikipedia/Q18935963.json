She is known for one book published in 1790.  The Westmorland Dialect, in three familiar Dialogues: in which an Attempt is made to illustrate the provincial Idiom was an early attempt at recording the local dialect. There were four editions of the book. Her work was later used in Specimens of the Westmorland Dialect published by the Revd Thomas Clarke in 1887.She was born near Cartmel and went to London for 18 years where she married a Captain Wheeler and worked as a housekeeper. She returned to Cumbria a widow where she wrote for the local press in plain English. She published her one book in dialect which initially had three dialogues but in later editions four. The conversations discuss a trip to London, the death of George III, christenings, deaths, cockfights and other subjects including hairstyles and fashion. The first edition is said to be so rare that the British Library does not have a copy.Wheeler died in Beetham where she had lived with her brother William in the medieval Arnside Tower. She was buried on 4 November 1804.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cumbrian dialect", "response": ["The earliest recordings of the dialect were in a book published by Agnes Wheeler in 1790.

Tower houses were built throughout the border regions of northern England and southern Scotland because of the threat posed by Border Reivers.Emery, p.183. Constructed of limestone rubble, the tower was originally five storeys high, measuring 50 feet by 34 feet. The tower was built with an adjacent wing of equal height built onto the side of the tower in a style common in Scotland, but rare in English tower houses.Pettifer, p.265. Historian Anthony Emery suggests that the design may have been influenced by that at Ashby de la Zouch Castle, rebuilt in 1464 by Lord Hastings.Emery, p.184. The tower suffered a serious fire in 1602 but after repairs remained in use; the historian Anthony Emery states that the tower was in use until the end of the 17th century, but the historian Roy Palmer states that William Coward and his sister Agnes Wheeler lived there at the end of the 18th century.Emery, p.184; Roy Palmer, \u2018Wheeler , Agnes (bap. 1734, d. 1804)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 1 June 2017"]}]}}
