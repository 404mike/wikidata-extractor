Due to his boyish looks he would often be cast as young innocents in films such as: The Wicked Lady (1945); The Rake's Progress (1945); Nicholas Nickleby (1947); and Powell and Pressburger's The Small Back Room (1949).When he was relegated to second features in the 1950s he concentrated on his stage career, maturing into an accomplished character actor in the process. The latter half of his career was mostly spent on television in such programmes as Softly, Softly; Out of the Unknown; Dixon of Dock Green; Doomwatch; Z-Cars; and perhaps most memorably as 'The Master of the Land of Fiction' in the Doctor Who serial, The Mind Robber.He was successively married to actresses Pauline Bentley and Anne Ridler, and died of a heart attack in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1972; where he was in a stage production, playing Winston Churchill.", "link_mentions": {}}}
