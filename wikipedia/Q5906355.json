Pearson started well, taking seven points from his first three games, which took Leicester into the top six for the first time since he had last been at the club, over 18 months previously, before Leicester faced the Hull City side Pearson had left just 18 days earlier. Leicester lost the game 2\u20131 thanks to a late Robert Koren strike, as Pearson was greeted with chants of \"Judas\" from the Hull fans. That result also signalled a downturn in form, beginning a run which saw Leicester fail to win for 5 consecutive games. However, after the new year, Pearson rang the changes for the trip to Crystal Palace in an attempt to get back to winning ways, recalling Aleksander Tunchev to play his first match of the season and bringing in reserve team player Tom Kennedy and 18-year-old youth academy graduate Liam Moore to make his first team debut for the club. His inexperienced team selection paid off as Leicester earnt a 2\u20131 victory to end their winless run."]}, {"page": "Sam Russell (footballer, born 1982)", "response": ["In the 2008\u201309 season Russell was handed the number one shirt for Rochdale.
