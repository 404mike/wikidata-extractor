Her father was Alan II, Earl of Menteith, who died c. 1330.  She is believed to have agreed with her kinsman Muireadhach III, in 1330, that he should hold the Earldom, but when he was killed in August 1332, Mary assumed the title.  She married Sir John Graham (d. 28 February 1347), who in her right became Earl of Monteith and assumed the title in May 1346. She died sometime prior to 29 April 1360.  She was the mother of Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of peers 1330\u20131339", "response": ["|Mary II, Countess of Menteith||1333||1360||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1340\u20131349", "response": ["|Earl of Menteith (1160)||Mary II, Countess of Menteith||1333||1360||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1350\u20131359", "response": ["|Earl of Menteith (1160)||Mary II, Countess of Menteith||1333||1360||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1360\u20131369", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Earl of Menteith (1160)||Mary II, Countess of Menteith||1333||1360||Died"]}, {"page": "Mary Menteith, Countess of Menteith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary II, Countess of Menteith"]}, {"page": "Mary II (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Mary II, Countess of Menteith (XIV century)"]}, {"page": "Alan II, Earl of Menteith", "response": ["Alan II, Earl of Menteith married an unknown lady, by whom he had a daughter Mary II, Countess of Menteith.J.
