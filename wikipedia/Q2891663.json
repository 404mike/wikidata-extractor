The British were represented by Churchill, Anthony Eden, General John Dill (Chief of the Imperial General Staff), General Hastings Ismay and Edward Spears, and the French by Reynaud, P\u00e9tain, Weygand, and Georges. Churchill demanded that the French take to guerrilla warfare, and reminded P\u00e9tain of how he had come to the aid of the British with forty French divisions in March 1918, receiving a dusty answer in each case. De Gaulle's fighting spirit made a strong impression on the British. At the meeting de Gaulle met P\u00e9tain for the first time in two years. P\u00e9tain noted his recent promotion to general, adding that he did not congratulate him, as ranks were of no use in defeat. When de Gaulle protested that P\u00e9tain himself had been promoted to brigadier-general and division commander at the Battle of the Marne in 1914, he replied that there was \"no comparison\" with the present situation. De Gaulle later conceded that P\u00e9tain was right about that much at least.Lacouture 1991, p. 197 De Gaulle missed the second day of the conference as he was in Rennes for a meeting (not mentioned in his memoirs) to discuss the plans for the Breton redoubt with General Ren\u00e9 Altmayer. He then returned to attend a cabinet meeting, at which it was clear that there was a growing movement for an armistice, and which decided that the government should move to Bordeaux rather than de Gaulle's preference for Quimper in Brittany.Lacouture 1991, p. 198", "===Flight with Edward Spears===", "At around 09:00 on the morning of 17 June, he flew to London on a British aircraft with Edward Spears. The escape was hair-raising. Spears claimed that de Gaulle had been reluctant to come, and that he had pulled him into the aircraft at the last minute, although de Gaulle's biographer does not accept this. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud. De Gaulle later told Andr\u00e9 Malraux of the mental anguish which his flight to London \u2013 a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many \u2013 had caused him.Lacouture 1991, pp. 211-6", "After the armistice was signed on 21 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke at 20:00 on 22 June to denounce it.Lacouture 1991, p. 236 The Bordeaux government reacted immediately, annulling his temporary promotion to brigadier-general with effect from the same day, and forcibly retiring him from the French Army (with the rank of colonel) on 23 June \"as a disciplinary measure\" (par mesure de discipline).Lacouture 1:243-4 On 23 June the British Government denounced the armistice as a breach of the Anglo-French treaty signed in March, and stated that they no longer regarded the Bordeaux Government as a fully independent state. They also \"took note\" of the plan to establish a French National Committee (FNC) in exile, but did not mention de Gaulle by name. Jean Monnet, Chairman of the Anglo-French Coordinating Committee, believed de Gaulle could not yet claim that he alone represented fighting France, and that French opinion would not rally to a man operating from British soil.  He said this in a letter to de Gaulle on June 23, and noted he had made his concerns known to British Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and Robert Vansittart, as well as Edward Spears. Monnet soon resigned as Chairman of the Anglo-French Coordinating Committee, and departed for the US to continue his work securing supplies from North America (now with the British Purchasing Commission.)", "In May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, and a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin. De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit, staffed by French doctors and British nurses. One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the Battle of France with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary's husband was General Edward Spears, the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940. When de Gaulle saw the Union Flags and Tricolours side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, \"Voil\u00e0 Spears! Vive Spears!\", he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home.

Churchill's man in Paris, Edward Spears, urged the French not to sign an armistice, saying that if French ports were occupied by Germany, Britain would have to bomb them. Spears reported that P\u00e9tain did not respond immediately but stood there \"perfectly erect, with no sign of panic or emotion. He did not disguise the fact that he considered the situation catastrophic.

He visited Reynaud, who still hoped to go to North Africa and declined to come to London. Reynaud still had control of secret government funds until the handover of power the next day, and made money available to de Gaulle.

Bonnet had also wanted to sack the Quai d'Orsay's Secretary-General Alexis Saint-Leg\u00e9r L\u00e9ger and replace him with a man more in tune with Bonnet's views, but Saint-Leg\u00e9r L\u00e9ger's increasing friendship with Daladier served to protect him. A popular legend has it that Saint-Leg\u00e9r L\u00e9ger was not fired because he knew too much about stock market speculations that Bonnet was alleged to have engaged in during the war crisis of September 1938, but there is no evidence to support this story.May, Ernest Strange Victroy, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 179.

Dirksen was especially anxious for Henlein to meet one Conservative backbencher, Winston Churchill, whom he considered to be one of the leading \"anti-German\" voices in the House of Commons. At his lunch with Churchill, Henlein used a historical analogy that he knew would appeal to him, namely that of the question of Home Rule for Ireland.  Henlein reminded Churchill how the government of H. H. Asquith (which Churchill was a minister in) had promised the Irish Home Rule, but failed to deliver in time, leading to the Irish war of independence and Ireland leaving the United Kingdom, going on to say that Czechoslovakia was in the same position in 1938 that the United Kingdom had been in 1913. As late as 3 June 1938, Churchill in a speech to the House of Commons described Heinlen as only seeking \"Home Rule\" for the Sudetenland, and expressed the hope if only Henlein could meet with President Bene\u0161, then a mutually acceptable compromise plan for federalisation of Czechoslovakia could be achieved."]}, {"page": "Spiers", "response": ["* Edward Louis Spiers, later Edward Spears (1886\u20131974), British Army officer and politician"]}, {"page": "Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont", "response": ["Egremont\u2019s first book The Cousins, the Friendship, Opinions and Activities of  Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and George Wyndham was published in 1977 and won the Yorkshire Post Prize for the best first book of that year.
