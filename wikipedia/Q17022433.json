He was awarded a Lambeth DMus degree in March 2002.\nHe is noted for his many contributions to several hymnals, his regular appearances on the BBC's Songs of Praise, presenting his weekly radio programme All Souls in Praise and daily radio programme All Souls In Praise Bitesize which broadcasts on Premier Christian Radio. He is the founder and Emeritus Conductor of All Souls Orchestra which performs annually at the Royal Albert Hall and throughout the UK under the banner of \"Prom Praise\" and \"Prom Praise for Schools\" (PP4S). Tredinnick's organ works have been performed by several respected performers including George Thalben-Ball, Nicolas Kynaston, and Gerard Brooks. He is currently a Professor of conducting, orchestration and academic studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and has recently been awarded the title of Emeritus Conductor of the All Souls Orchestra, in recognition of his pioneering legacy in directing Christian musical worship around the world.  He continues to conduct the orchestra in tours of the UK and around the world, in partnership with his successor, Michael Andrews.\nTredinnick's arranging style combines traditional hymns and Christian songs with harmonies from jazz and modernist music, making frequent use of chromaticism and dissonance. His trademark sound is euphoric, uplifting and spontaneous, with an inclusive feel. He is generally regarded as one of the UK's foremost church musicians.\nTredinnick has been involved with the Jubilate Group for many years, which is concerned with updating old-fashioned language in hymnody and for publishing new musical resources for congregations; he is now chair of the group.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "All Souls Church, Langham Place", "response": ["Musical worship mixes contemporary and traditional styles, featuring either the church's worship band, orchestra, singing group or choir at all the main regular Sunday services, under the leadership of Michael Andrews.
