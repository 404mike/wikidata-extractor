However despite this lack of consistent selection, he managed to claim two winner's medals in the Scottish Cup, in 1901 and 1906.After his Hearts spell, Philip then moved on to Dundee, where he was again a regular in his first year but a reserve thereafter, playing in only six Scottish Football League fixtures in three seasons.", "link_mentions": {}}}
