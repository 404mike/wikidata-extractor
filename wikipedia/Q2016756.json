The Bemrose machine was designed as a rouletting machine. As such, it proved impracticable for stamp separation but in 1856 was successfully converted to a perforating machine by George C. Howard of Toppan Carpenter, stamp printers for the American Government.\"The Bemrose Perforating Machine\", The London Philatelist, February 2009 (Ray Simpson) Both the stroke and rotary processes have been refined since then, but are basically still the ones in use in the 21st century.  The key decision for the perforator is the spacing of the holes; if too far apart, the stamps will not separate easily, and the stamps are likely to tear, but if too close, the stamps will tend to come apart in normal handling. In a few cases the size of the holes has been a factor. In the case of certain stamps produced by Australia for sale in rolls rather than sheets (coil stamps) a pattern can be seen on the stamp's short side of two small, ten large and two small holes."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Henry Howe Bemrose"]}, {"page": "Derby (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Sir Henry Howe Bemrose ||Conservative"]}, {"page": "Sir Henry Howe Bemrose", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Howe Bemrose"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["*Henry Howe Bemrose, 1895: 67"]}, {"page": "List of Old Derbeians", "response": ["*Henry Howe Bemrose (1827\u20131911), member of parliament for Derby"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Henry Howe Bemrose; MP for Derby (1895\u20131900)"]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Derby", "response": ["*1877 Sir Henry Howe Bemrose"]}, {"page": "Max Bemrose", "response": ["The younger son of Dr Henry Howe Bemrose, of Derby, and the grandson of Sir Henry Howe Bemrose (1827\u20131911), who in the 1890s had been member of parliament for Derby, Bemrose was educated at Derby School, Brighton College; and Clare College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA and MA in the school of Economics.BEMROSE, Sir Max (John Maxwell) in Who Was Who 1897\u20132007, Retrieved 5 June 2008, from BEMROSE, Sir Max (John Maxwell)"]}, {"page": "Bemrose", "response": ["* Henry Howe Bemrose (1827 \u2013 1911), a British printer and publisher, as well as mayor"]}, {"page": "1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours", "response": ["*Henry Howe Bemrose MP."]}, {"page": "Derby Central Library", "response": ["In 1914 the curator's house alongside the library was demolished to make way for an extension to the building, intended to house the recently acquired Bemrose Library.
