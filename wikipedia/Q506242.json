Immortality of the mind is sometimes accomplished by periodically moving it to a new physical body, transferring either just the consciousness as in A. E. van Vogt's 1948 novel The World of Null-A or transplanting the entire brain as in Michael G. Coney's 1974 novel Friends Come in Boxes. Similarly, personality traits are transferred from one person to another using the malaria parasite as a vector to attain a form of immortality in Indian author Amitav Ghosh's 1995 novel The Calcutta Chromosome. A kind of non-physical digital immortality is also achieved by transferring a person's consciousness to a computer in works such as William Gibson's Sprawl trilogy starting with the 1984 novel Neuromancer. Cryonic freezing is used as a means to extend life until such a time that immortality is expected to be available in some stories such as Clifford D. Simak's 1967 novel Why Call Them Back from Heaven?."]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF 9", "response": ["*\"Symbiote\" (Michael G.
