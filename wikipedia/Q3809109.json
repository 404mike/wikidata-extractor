He played in the club's first-ever FA Cup tie in 1883, scoring twice in a 4\u20131 win over Long Eaton Rangers, and first-ever Football League match in September 1888. He also captained the team in the 1889 FA Cup Final, where they lost 0\u20133 to league champions Preston North End.\nBrodie won three England caps, making his debut on 2 March 1889, when he scored - as captain - in a 6\u20131 win over Ireland at Anfield. His other appearances were against Scotland and, again, Ireland.\nHe retired from playing in 1891 due to a knee injury and became headmaster of a Wolverhampton school. He later returned to Wolves as a director.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of violent spectator incidents in sports", "response": ["* January 26 \u2013 Following the Football League game between Woolwich Arsenal and Burton Wanderers, referee John Brodie was assaulted by a spectator and knocked unconscious.
