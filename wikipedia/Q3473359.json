Its main character, Alice Nutter, is based on the real-life woman of the same name. The Guardian's Sarah Hall describes the work: \"the narrative voice is irrefutable; this is old-fashioned storytelling, with a sermonic tone that commands and terrifies. It's also like courtroom reportage, sworn witness testimony. The sentences are short, truthful \u2013 and dreadful.... Absolutism is Winterson's forte, and it's the perfect mode to verify supernatural events when they occur. You're not asked to believe in magic. Magic exists. A severed head talks. A man is transmogrified into a hare. The story is stretched as tight as a rack, so the reader's disbelief is ruptured rather than suspended. And if doubt remains, the text's sensuality persuades.\""]}, {"page": "Granta", "response": ["* Sarah Hall "]}, {"page": "Aberystwyth University", "response": ["*Sarah Hall, writer, poet"]}, {"page": "John Llewellyn Rhys Prize", "response": ["|2006/7 || Sarah Hall || The Carhullan Army || ||Ceridwen Dovey, Blood KinJoanna Kavenna, IngloriousRobert Macfarlane, The Wild PlacesGwendoline Riley, Joshua SpasskyRory Stewart, Occupational Hazards"]}, {"page": "National Book Critics Circle Award", "response": ["* Sarah Hall, Burntcoat (Custom House)"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Sarah Hall"]}, {"page": "LGBT themes in speculative fiction", "response": ["Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, as a pair of gay male ambassador-spies attempt to infiltrate and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men.
