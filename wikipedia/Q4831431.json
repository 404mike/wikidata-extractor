Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson, who encouraged students to think about military history by asking what they would have done in the place of the commanders.Jeffery 2006, pp. 17\u201320. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893.Jeffery 1985, p. 2. Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners (Aylmer Haldane also claimed the same in his 1948 autobiography, but this is not corroborated by Wilson's diary). Launcelot Kiggell was in the year below. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Roberts.", "In 1901 Wilson spent nine months working under Ian Hamilton in the War Office, working to allocate honours and awards from the recent South African War. He himself received a Mentioned in Despatches as \"an officer of considerable ability\"  who displayed \"energy and success\", and a Distinguished Service Order, which Aylmer Haldane later claimed Wilson had insisted on receiving out of jealousy that he had been awarded it.Jeffery 2006, pp. 42\u20133. Wilson was also recommended for brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on attaining a substantive majority. On 31 December, referring to the bruising of egos involved in the distribution of honours (Nicholson and Kelly-Kenny both felt that they had received insufficient recognition), he commented that the job had \"lost some of my old friends, but I hope not many\".", "On 16 July 1906 Rawlinson told Wilson that he wanted him to succeed him at the end of the year, and the news appeared in the press in August amidst praise for Rawlinson, suggesting that he rather than Wilson had leaked it. In September and October 1906 Lyttelton favoured Colonel Edward (\"Edna\") May, Assistant Director of Military Operations and described by Lord Esher as \"a worthy but stupid officer\". Ewart (Director of Military Operations) and Haig (Director of Military Training) opposed May's appointment, whilst Field Marshal Roberts wrote to Richard Haldane (Secretary of State for War from December 1905) and Esher recommending Wilson on the basis of his excellent staff work in South Africa, and as a strong character needed to maintain Rawlinson's improvements to training at Camberley. Wilson, who learned indirectly from Aylmer Haldane (cousin of Richard Haldane) on 24 October that he was to get the job, wrote to thank Roberts, and was in little doubt that his support had clinched it for him. Wilson remained very close to Roberts, often joining him for Christmas Dinner and attending his Golden Wedding in May 1909.Jeffery 2006, pp. 64\u20136, 76. French (then commanding 1st Army Corps at Aldershot Command) had initially been suspicious of Wilson as a Roberts prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but now supported his candidacy, and by 1912 Wilson had become his most trusted adviser.Holmes 2004, p. 145.", "By February 1920 Wilson's Staff wanted to reduce commitment to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), despite inevitable loss of prestige, as occupation of the whole country was not necessary to safeguard the southern Persian oilfields. In May 1920 Wilson submitted a joint paper with Churchill and Trenchard (Chief of Air Staff) complaining about the cost of keeping 10,000 British and 50,000 Indian troops there. When revolt broke out in Mesopotamia, Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull out of Persia to send reinforcements (he also needed troops for Ireland and the rest of the UK), but Lloyd George said that Curzon \"would not stand it\". By October 1920 the local British commander Sir Aylmer Haldane managed to restore order but on 10 December Wilson minuted his agreement to an appraisal by the Director of Military Operations that \"we ran things too fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided\". Wilson was privately scathing about what he called \"Hot Air, Aeroplanes & Arabs\" \u2013 Trenchard's plan for Air Defence backed by Arab levies, announced by Churchill at the Cairo Conference in July 1921 \u2013 although glad at the reduction in military commitment, and wrote to Rawlinson that when trouble came Churchill would \"hop into an aeroplane and fly away, waving Ta-Ta to any poor bloody native who is stupid enough to back us\".Jeffery 2006, pp. 249\u201351."]}, {"page": "Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane", "response": ["Following his departure from the government Haldane went to the front to meet his old friend General Haig, and his cousin, General Aylmer Haldane; but he was exhausted on being ejected from Cabinet. Having been awarded the Order of Merit in 1915, in the personal gift of George V, he wrote a Memorandum of Events, 1906\u201315, to defend his reputation. It was published in April 1916. Haldane thought Lloyd George's new government, formed in December 1916, \"very low class\". Haldane told Lord Buckmaster at this time, \"Asquith is a first-class head of a deliberative council. He is versed in precedents, acts on principle, and knows how and when to compromise. Lloyd George knows nothing for precedents and cares for no principles, but he has fire in his belly and that is what we want\"."]}, {"page": "Horace Smith-Dorrien", "response": ["Aylmer Haldane recorded that at the 1909 manoeuvres French was \"unfair\" in summing up for Paget against Smith-Dorrien.Travers 1987, pp. 15\u201316. Smith-Dorrien annoyed French \u2013 with whom he had still been on relatively cordial terms at the end of the South African War \u2013 by abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunk soldiers, by more than doubling the number of playing fields available to the men, by cutting down trees, and by building new and better barracks. On 21 August 1909 he lectured all his cavalry officers \u2013 in the 16th Lancers\u2019 mess \u2013 about the importance of improving their men's musketry. By 1910 the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien objected to French\u2019s womanising, a fact which Richard Holmes attributes in part to Smith-Dorrien being happily married to a young and pretty wife, and French\u2019s nephew later claimed to have overheard \"a ferocious exchange\" between them, in which Smith-Dorrien declared \"Too many whores around your headquarters, Field-Marshal\".Holmes 2004, p131-3", "Smith-Dorrien later recorded that General French inflicted \"pin-pricks\" on him from February 1915 onwards, including the removal of Forestier-Walker as his Chief of Staff.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 204. This was supposedly on the grounds that Forestier-Walker was needed to command a division training in England, although two months later he was still waiting to receive its command. French told Haig that Smith-Dorrien was \"a weak spot\" (5 February 1915). During the Battle of Neuve Chapelle he was dissatisfied (13 March 1915) at the apparent \"lack of determination\" of Smith-Dorrien's diversionary attacks.Holmes 2004, pp. 272\u2013274, 282\u2013284. Smith-Dorrien was not always immune to the excessive optimism which British officers were expected to display throughout the war: Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary on 15 March 1915 that prior to the battle Smith-Dorrien had been claiming that the war would be won in March 1915.Robbins 2005, p. 70.

He repeated this advice to Haig over dinner (3 July) although he was concerned that Haig would not insist hard enough.Prior & Wilson 1992, p. 270 Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary (30 June 1917) his lack of keenness at going to Fifth Army and wrote that Gough was \"very impetuous and difficult to get on with\" as well as \"excitable and thoughtless and impatient\".Robbins 2005, pp. 32, 33: Robbins does not give an exact cite for the latter quote although from the context it appears to be Haldane", "In early September Gough ordered XIX Corps to make small-scale attacks in the St Julien area. Not one of the fortified farmhouses was captured, and after the fourth attack Haig remonstrated with Gough. However, Gough protested (Haig diary, 9 September) that two of the divisions were soon to leave the salient, and that for the sake of their \"training and morale\" they should be made to retake ground which they had recently lost to counterattacks. Haig permitted a fourth, equally unsuccessful attack on 10 September.Prior & Wilson 1996, pp. 109\u2013110 Kiggell (Haig diary 10 September) reported that \"some of Gough's subordinates\" did not give an honest answer as to the likely success of attacks and remarked to Neil Malcolm of the order to make only limited attacks: \"We did not expect you to pursue the matter so vigorously\". Fanshawe \u2013 GOC V Corps, which had recently replaced Watts' XIX Corps in the line \u2013 was opposed to further attacks, while the other corps commander McKenzie, possibly put up to it by Gough, was in favour. Haig then interviewed the divisional commanders, then urged Gough to desist, which Gough agreed to do.Farrar-Hockley 1974, p. 232Sheffield 2005, p. 323 Aylmer Haldane recorded in his diary (10 September) Lambton's lack of keenness at going to Fifth Army. Haig wrote (diary 18 September), after touring Fifth Army and corps HQ, that the Chief of Staff Malcolm seemed \"fatigued\" and that \"Fifth Army staff work is not as satisfactory as last year.\"Bond & Cave 1999, p. 90Sheffield 2005, p. 328"]}, {"page": "Armoured train", "response": ["The British Army employed armoured trains during the Second Boer War, most famously a train that was extemporised in the railway workshops at Ladysmith just before the siege was closed round the town.

Winston Churchill accompanied the mission as a war correspondent. The train was ambushed and part-derailed, and Haldane, Churchill and some 70 of the troops were captured after a fire-fight, although the locomotive got away with the wounded.Gen Sir Aylmer Haldane, A Soldier's Saga, Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1948, pp. 139\u201346.Rayne Kruger, Goodbye Dolly Gray, London: Cassell 1959/Pan 1974, , pp. 104\u20135.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1979/abridged edition 1993, , pp. 95\u20136.
