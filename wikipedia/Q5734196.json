During this time wave after wave of the enemy failed to get up to him, but at last with the help of a low-flying aircraft the enemy managed to gain a strong foothold in the trench. As the position was now untenable, Private Columbine told the two remaining men to get away, and although he was being bombed on either side, he kept his gun firing, inflicting losses, until he was killed by a bomb which blew him up along with his gun.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walton-on-the-Naze", "response": ["The unusual war memorial commemorates a Halifax crew who all died when they crashed on the Naze.
