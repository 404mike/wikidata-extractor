E. Atkinson, was a prolific English children\u2019s writer.\nShe was best known for her series on the Lockett family Series - children's adventure stories typical of the 1940s and 1950s, and written from a middle class viewpoint. Her Fricka series was mostly about ponies, and was generally viewed as only middling quality for the genre. Although never in the first rank of children's writers, she was especially good at creating un-stereotyped and interesting characters. Her earlier works were better received critically than her later works.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*M. E.
