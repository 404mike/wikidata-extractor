Handyside went on to make over 200 appearances for Grimsby in all competitions and was in the team that won the Football League Second Division play-offs and Football League Trophy during the 1997\u201398 season. In 2001 after nine years at Blundell Park, Handyside joined Stoke City who he went on to captain and eventually earning promotion out of the Second Division like he had previously done at Grimsby. In 2003, he signed with Barnsley where he remained for a year before dropping into non-league football with Northwich Victoria. In 2006, he signed with Hucknall Town before retiring at the end of the 2006\u201307 season at the age of 33.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["The Mariners began to produce homegrown talent from the club's youth academy, including Jack Lester, John Oster, Gary Croft and Peter Handyside.Buckley departed Grimsby in October 1994 to join West Bromwich Albion and he was replaced by defender Brian Laws. Laws steered Grimsby to a 10th-place finish in his first season as manager. During his tenure, Laws became famous for a changing-room altercation after a defeat at Luton with Italian striker Ivano Bonetti, which left the latter with a fractured cheekbone, and caused the popular player to leave the club at the end of the season. Grimsby finished 17th and were in the battle to avoid relegation right up to the penultimate game of the season. In the 1996\u201397 season the Mariners were relegated from Division One. Despite flowing goals from Clive Mendonca, notably good performances from John Oster and newcomer Kingsley Black, Grimsby failed to save themselves. The club had suffered from the losses of Gary Croft, who made a \u00a31.7 million move to Blackburn Rovers and ever present goalkeeper Paul Crichton."]}, {"page": "List of Grimsby Town F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Peter Handyside||||CB||1992\u20132000||190||4"]}, {"page": "Zhang Enhua", "response": ["In 2000, Zhang was made a transfer target of second tier English club Grimsby Town and was then brought to the club on a 3-month loan deal to play in the Football League Championship. The defender would be part of a new wave of foreign imports at the club as newly installed manager Lennie Lawrence brought in David Nielsen, Knut Anders Fostervold and Menno Willems. Enhua was originally sent in as cover for the injured Peter Handyside, and after a nervous first game, he settled into life at Grimsby, even scoring three times for the club. Lawrence admitted talking to the club over a possible deal being made more permanent but his wages were too big for the club, and Enhua departed the club after his loan spell. He is still regarded as a minor cult hero amongst Grimsby supporters, who took very well to the player while he played in England. His goal celebration in the 1\u20130 victory over Burnley was used by ITV Yorkshire Television in the opening credits for their \"Goals on Sunday\" television programme throughout the 2001\u201302 season."]}, {"page": "Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson", "response": ["In 2000\u201301 Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n was again busy bringing in Icelandic players with R\u00edkhar\u00f0ur Da\u00f0ason, Stef\u00e1n \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson, Birkir Kristinsson and Danish defender Henrik Risom all agreeing to move to Stoke-on-Trent. Results were often inconsistent meaning automatic promotion was not possible and Stoke made it into the play-offs. They faced Walsall who, after a 0\u20130 draw in the first leg, beat Stoke 4\u20132, meaning that Stoke faced a fourth season in the third tier. The pressure was on Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n to gain automatic promotion in 2001\u201302 and he tried a different approach. He sold both Graham Kavanagh and Peter Thorne to Cardiff City for a combined fee of \u00a32.7 million and with that money he brought in defender Peter Handyside from Grimsby Town who was made captain, goalkeeper Neil Cutler, Belarusian defender Sergei Shtanyuk, Belgian midfielder Jurgen Vandeurzen, David Rowson from Aberdeen and most impressively former Dutch international Peter Hoekstra. Stoke were again lacking the consistency for automatic promotion and for the third season running they entered the play-offs. The opponents this time were Cardiff and it looked like being another failure as the Bluebirds won the 1st leg at Stoke 2\u20131. Stoke went into the second leg at the notoriously hostile Ninian Park 2\u20131 down and with both sides missing chances the match was 0\u20130 after 90 minutes and in the final minute of injury time James O'Connor scored to send the match into extra time. And Stoke scored again via an O'Connor shot which deflected in off Souleymane Oular\u00e9 to give Stoke the most dramatic victory. The final against Brentford was not as dramatic, as Stoke won comfortably 2\u20130 thanks to goals from Deon Burton and an own goal from Ben Burgess. However, despite finally achieving promotion via the play-offs at the third attempt Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n's contract was not renewed."]}, {"page": "Mark Lever", "response": ["Lever came through the youth ranks at Grimsby Town and was promoted to the club's first team squad by Alan Buckley at the beginning of the 1987\u20131988 season. He naturally soon became one of the club's regular centre backs, and found himself slotting in at the side of veteran centre half Paul Futcher. Lever received the club's \"Supporters Young Player of The Season\" awards in both 1989 and 1991. He went on to be an integral part of the Town side that earned two back to back promotions in 1990 and 1991. When Futcher moved on, Grimsby nurtured in Peter Handyside as his long-term replacement, and both players were part of an iconic Mariners defensive line up in the nineties that included the likes of Gary Croft, Graham Rodger, John McDermott and Tony Gallimore."]}, {"page": "Richard Smith (footballer, born 1970)", "response": ["In September 1995, Smith was loaned to fellow First Division side Grimsby Town. He would make 8 appearances for Brian Laws side during this spell which led to him joining the club permanently in March 1996 when Leicester and Grimsby agreed a \u00a350,000 transfer fee. In his time at Grimsby he was in and out of the team both under Laws and his replacement Alan Buckley. The Mariners defensive set up in the mid to late nineties had boasted such club legends as Mark Lever, Peter Handyside, John McDermott, Graham Rodger and Kevin Jobling, so Smith was dipped in and out of the first team. The club were eventually relegated to the Second Division in May 1997, only to bounce back the following season by winning the Second Division Play-Off Final at Wembley Stadium. Town had also triumphed in the Football League Trophy that season, but injury had forced Smith to miss the entire season."]}, {"page": "David Smith (footballer, born 1968)", "response": ["On 31 August 1998, he was instrumental in the thrashing of his old club, he provided two assists and a goal in the 5\u20131 home tie against West Bromwich Albion, he took a corner for Peter Handyside to head home from close range in the 6th minute, then on 17 minutes Smith's free kick was met by Richard Smith and Wayne Burnett placed a half-volley past Alan Miller, then in the 27th minute Jack Lester beat two men down the right before the striker crossed the ball for Smith to score."]}, {"page": "Tony Gallimore", "response": ["At Blundell Park he would turn out to be the club's long-term replacement for departing left back Gary Croft who had left Grimsby in a multimillion-pound deal to join Blackburn Rovers. After playing out the last few games of the 1995\u201396 campaign, Gallimore would prepare himself for a tough first full season, with The Mariners losing their first division status, and suffering a relegation, this spelled the end of an era at the club and important key players such as John Oster and Clive Mendonca moved on to new clubs. In the 1997\u201398 season, Gallimore would play an important role in the club's sudden return to the first division, whilst beating Northampton Town at Wembley Stadium in the play-offs, the club also defeated AFC Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy at the same venue. Gallimore along with fellow defenders John McDermott, Peter Handyside and Mark Lever as well as goalkeeper Aidan Davison were noted as the strongest defensive line up in the Second Division that year, and one of the strongest in the whole country. Gallimore went on to play the next five seasons at Grimsby and featured as the club's main choice left back until his departure at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, when Grimsby were to lose their first division status once more. Injury had troubled Gallimore in parts of his last couple of seasons with Grimsby, and his place had been contested by youngster Ben Chapman and also with the arrival of Darren Barnard in 2002, Gallimore had struggled to hold his place down in the team. With the club relegated, Grimsby opted not to renew his contract and he left the club after featuring in seven different seasons for The Mariners.", "In August 2003 he signed a one-year deal with Grimsby's rivals Barnsley along with former teammate Peter Handyside. He went on to feature in just over 20 games for the club as yet again, injury blighted his season.
