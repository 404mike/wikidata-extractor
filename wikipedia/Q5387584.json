He was educated at Tonbridge School, where he won the Cras, the school's cross country race.\nWhen he won his VC he was 31 years old, and an Acting Captain in the Special Reserve, Royal Field Artillery, attached to A Bty., 88th Brigade. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his deeds on 10 April 1918 at Messines, Belgium.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and skilful leadership in the field when in command of his battery. Capt. Dougall maintained his guns in action from early morning throughout a heavy concentration of gas and high-explosive shell. Finding that he could not clear the crest owing to the withdrawal of our line, Captain Dougall ran his guns on to the top of the ridge to fire over open sights. By this time our infantry had been pressed back in line with the guns. Captain Dougall at once assumed command of the situation, rallied and organised the infantry, supplied them with Lewis guns, and armed as many gunners as he could spare with rifles. With these he formed a line in front of his battery which during this period was harassing the advancing enemy with a rapid rate of fire. Although exposed to both rifle and machine gun fire this officer fearlessly walked about as though on parade, calmly giving orders and encouraging everybody. He inspired the infantry with his assurance that \"So long as you stick to your trenches I will keep my guns here\". This line was maintained throughout the day, thereby delaying the enemy's advance for over twelve hours. In the evening, having expended all ammunition, the battery received orders to withdraw. This was done by man-handling the guns over a distance of about 800 yards of shell-cratered country, an almost impossible feat considering the ground and the intense machine gun fire. Owing to Captain Dougall's personality and skilful leadership throughout this trying day there is no doubt that a serious breach in our line was averted. This gallant officer was killed four days later whilst directing the fire of his battery.\n\nHe was killed in action at Kemmel, Belgium on 14 April 1918. His VC is owned by Pembroke College, Cambridge.\nPrior to his war service, Dougall was an Assistant Engineer at the Bombay Port Trust, and there is an officers' residence building named after him (called Dougall House) there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tonbridge School", "response": ["*Eric Stuart Dougall was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross to go with his Military Cross in Belgium during the closing stages of World War I."]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Eric Stuart Dougall || British Army || 1918 ||  First World War || Messines"]}, {"page": "Dunorlan Park", "response": ["Eric Stuart Dougall Acting Captain in the Special Reserve attached to A Battery, 88th Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery."]}, {"page": "List of Old Tonbridgians", "response": ["* Eric Stuart Dougall, Victoria Cross, First World War"]}, {"page": "Dougall", "response": ["*Eric Stuart Dougall (1886\u20131918), English recipient"]}]}}
