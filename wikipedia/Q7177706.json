In 2002, while Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer, Dacre commented about his high admiration for him: \"I feel he is one of the very few politicians of this administration who's touched by the mantle of greatness\". Brown returned the favour at an event at the Savoy Hotel which celebrated the tenth anniversary of Dacre's editorship of the Mail in 2003. In a video presentation, Brown said that Dacre \"has devised, developed and delivered one of the great newspaper success stories of any generation\" and was \"someone of great journalistic skill, an editor of great distinction and someone of very great personal warmth\". Journalist Polly Toynbee referred to this relationship as an \"incomprehensible and grovelling friendship\" on the part of Brown with \"Labour's worst enemy\". In explanation, Peter Wilby thought both men were \"puritans at heart\". Campbell, however, has written that Brown in conversation always \"adamantly denied\" being a \"personal friend\" of Dacre.", "According to Cristina Odone, writing for The Observer, Dacre has a reputation towards underlings of \"verbal abuse\" and \"a drill sergeant's delight in public humiliation\".

He demands greater restrictions on the BBC, fewer on his own industry\". While Dacre said \"it is the duty of the media to take an ethical stand\", according to Wilby \"his idea of ethics includes running stories that are, at best, distorted and, at worst, plain wrong\".

According to Peter Wilby in an April 2016 New Statesman profile of Milne, his most controversial decision among The Guardian staff was to print a 2004 article by Osama bin Laden, assembled from recordings of one of his speeches. While almost all thought it should have been published, a small majority thought it should not have been run as a comment piece, although the Readers' Editor later defended this decision.", "Milne's period in this role was described by Naomi Klein in her book The Shock Doctrine as having turned The Guardians comment section into a \"truly global debating forum.\" Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan asserted that Milne's greatest achievement \"was to take full advantage of the expansion of The Guardians comment pages ... making them the most thought-provoking opinion section in Britain.\" Hannan also praised him as \"a sincere, eloquent and uncomplicated Marxist.\" Following changes in staff responsibilities, he was succeeded as comment editor by Georgina Henry, with Toby Manhire as her deputy. Milne was moved to his role as associate editor in 2007, according to Peter Wilby because he was building up too many writers in his own image, and devoting too much space to Palestine.", "According to Peter Wilby, writing in the New Statesman in March 2018, Milne as Corbyn's spin doctor \"has proved rather good at it. Most lobby journalists, initially hostile, now respect and even like him, finding his calm, courteous and expletive-free manner a refreshing change from many of his recent counterparts.\" Wilby writes that Milne is the closest of the leader's team to Corbyn, after John McDonnell.

The work, in which Webster argued that abuse scandals could be phenomena created by public hysteria, received praise from British journalists. Peter Wilby calls The Secret of Bryn Estyn \"exhaustively researched\", noting that while it was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize, it went largely unnoticed by the British press. Wilby writes that Webster compares modern scandals of mass abuse to the witch-hunts of the Middle Ages.

Wilby wrote \"As Hitchens sees it, 'the broken compass' is chiefly the Conservatives' fault. Even under Thatcher, they accepted too many of Labour's social democratic and liberal reforms. So we have a permanent government of the centre and one of Labour's main aims is to stop a genuinely Conservative party emerging that may attract working-class votes on such issues as \"immigration and disorder\" and getting Britain out of Europe. 'It was greatly in Labour's interest, once the Tory party had accepted so much of Labour's programme as unalterable, that the Tory party should be preserved against the danger of dissolution,' Hitchens writes. There is a grain of truth in all this, but on the left most would reverse the argument. The postwar consensus was destroyed in the Thatcher years and Labour failed to restore it, accepting, at least until the credit crunch, unrestrained neoliberal capitalism. New Labour's appeal to business and the city was that it closed off, perhaps forever, the possibility of a genuinely socialist alternative\"."]}]}}
