The one major change in planning was the combination of the four internal courtyards into one large one.

In this role he was notable for his efforts to prevent the spread of rabies.  The creation of the Board of Agriculture had brought a boost to Long's career in 1889.  But opposition rose up strongly, when the Dog Muzzlers act, prompted the Laymen's League in Liverpool to contest the Church discipline bill.  Long became increasingly unpopular in his constituency accused of being \"irascible and scheming\", and was advised to change seats.  But this did not prevent in 1895 admittance to the Privy Council.  The bourgeois Navy League in Liverpool could not wait to get rid of him but his powerful friends, like the \"somnolent\" Duke of Devonshire gave large donations to the Anti-Socialist Union - and this would be disastrous to the Union, for it would immediately alienate every snob and mediocrity \u2026\"  Yet Long was thick-skinned and seems impervious to the insults, for he remained remarkably successful at the polls.Claude Lowther to R.

But in the south and west, obdurate landlords refused land sales to tenantry leading to boycotts and cattle-driving.  The damage done to unionist farms and farmers was frightening.  MacDonnell continually urged compromise, but Long ignored him.  The dispute with Lords Dudley and Dunraven dragged on into August 1905, with their attitude of intransigence towards Long's attempts at Unionist reform, and obedience to the law.  On 25 May 1905, the issues were discussed in the Commons.  He wished to strengthen Unionism; but both Dudley and Long appealed to Balfour for adjudication.  Balfour opined that the Chief Secretary was both in the Commons and in the cabinet so Dudley had to be content that the power of the Lords was waning.  During the last quarter of 1905, Long advised the postponement of dissolution, as it would hit Unionists hard in \"the Country\" and would hand numerous electorates to radicals.  He warned of the loss of seats of Bristol West and South.  In December 1905, true to his word, he himself was defeated by 2,692 votes.  Long continued to distrust 'Birmingham & Co' as he called Chamberlain's struggle for a policy of Tariff recognition, which was already driving the party away from the Free Trade north.  Nonetheless he continued to co-operate transnationally with conservative parties in Germany, such as Reichspartei right up until the second Moroccan crisis in 1911.with his colleague in the Anti-Socialist Union, Claude Lowther MP."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Claude Lowther"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1900 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Claude Lowther"]}, {"page": "Independent Parliamentary Group", "response": ["Several Members of Parliament joined the group, including Bottomley, Cecil Beck, Christopher Lowther, Claude Lowther,F.
