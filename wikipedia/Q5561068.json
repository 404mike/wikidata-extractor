The sackings were mockingly named after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives, when Adolf Hitler had many Sturmabteilung supporters of Ernst R\u00f6hm either executed or arrested. Macmillan was accused of having acted hastily and of being ungrateful in sacking his party's most loyal officials. His reputation of being calm and unflappable in a crisis was badly tarnished, and his ratings in opinion polls fell sharply. His political opponents made capital from this: Liberal MP Jeremy Thorpe, in a humorous twist on a biblical phrase, observed that \"Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his friends for his life.\" Lloyd was cheered on his next appearance in the House on 17 July, while Macmillan was faced with silence from his own benches, and jeers from the opposition. The opposition tabled a motion of censure against Macmillan, which was debated on 26 July. Macmillan also faced divisions within his own party. Conservative MP Gilbert Longden, employing a similar humorous twist on Rudyard Kipling's \"If\u2014\", congratulated him on keeping his head, while all around him were losing theirs. Former Prime Minister Anthony Eden and former Minister Nigel Birch also voiced their disapproval. Despite these voices of dissent, the reaction from most Conservative MPs was positive."]}, {"page": "Durham School", "response": ["Bow, Durham School is the Durham School preparatory institution for pupils between the ages of 3 to 11 years.
