That summer he played in ten first-class and four List A games. His batting was unremarkable, and he did not reach 50 in any of these innings. However, he did manage what proved to be his only five-wicket innings haul in first-class cricket when he claimed 5\u201360 against Sussex at Worcester in late August.\nHe finished with 24 first-class wickets that season, his best aggregate.\nIn 1972 he took 22 wickets, but after that his bowling was less to the fore. He was in and out of the side between 1972 and 1974, though he did make the occasional large score. In the first-class game, he made the first and larger of his two centuries, this being the 141 he hit against Oxford University, following it up with 80 in the second innings.\nHe also made his highest List A score of 95 in this period, this innings coming in July 1974 in a Gillette Cup quarter-final against Nottinghamshire.1975 proved to be Wilkinson's last year of county cricket, but it was also the season in which he had the most cricket, turning out for 16 first-class and 13 List A games. The statistical highlight of his summer was the second and final first-class century, 102 (albeit in an ultimately losing cause) against Kent in June.\nHis 697 first-class runs in the season were by far a personal best; he had never previously reached 300. Wilkinson's last first-team game was a John Player League match against Somerset at Taunton on 14 September 1975: he scored 0* and held one catch, to dismiss Ian Botham.After leaving the first-class game, Wilkinson continued to play minor cricket, and was part of the highly successful Old Hill Cricket Club side of the mid-1980s, playing in victorious William Younger Cup and Cockspur Cup finals in 1984, 1985 and 1987.\nIn the first of these games, he hit 76* to guide Old Hill to a five-wicket victory after they had fallen to 55/4 in pursuit of 194 to win. Whilst playing for Old Hill Cricket Club he also scored a 162 not out which was a Birmingham League record  for a number of years. Wilkinson then captained Kidderminster Cricket Club until 1998. He was president of the Birmingham League in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cedric Boyns", "response": ["Boyns started his career at Worcestershire in 1972, making a useful 47 opening for the Second XI against their Derbyshire equivalents on 31 July. He played two more Second XI matches that season, two in 1973, and then a considerable number in the second half of 1974. However, by the end of that year, in 25 innings his debut 47 remained his highest score. 1975 saw Boyns make two Second XI hundreds, on both occasions sharing large partnerships with fellow centurion Keith Wilkinson. Boyns also bowled for the first time in this season."]}, {"page": "Indian cricket team in England in 1971", "response": ["Gavaskar completed his thousand on the second morning but fell for 194. It was the highest score made for the Indians in the tour. The declaration came soon after at 383 for 3. Worcestershire's fifth wicket fell at 92 but John Parker and Keith Wilkinson added 100 for the sixth wicket. The 19-year-old Parker making his debut for the county, scored 91 and would go on to captain New Zealand. India declared at lunch on the final day 285 ahead and 210 minutes left. Worcestershire fell 40 runs short with Jim Yardley reaching a century."]}, {"page": "Paul Pridgeon", "response": ["Pridgeon was given only occasional opportunities for the next three seasons, but in 1976 things turned his way: Brian Brain and Keith Wilkinson left the club, while Jim Cumbes spent the summer in the United States playing football."]}, {"page": "Keith Wilkinson", "response": ["Keith Wilkinson may refer to:", "* Keith Wilkinson (musician), British musician who was the bassist for Squeeze", "* Keith Wilkinson (reporter), British television reporter", "* Keith Wilkinson (cricketer) (born 1950), former English cricketer"]}]}}
