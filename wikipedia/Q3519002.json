She is known for her role as Raquel in the BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, whom she played from December 1988 until the programme ended in 2003.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Only Fools and Horses", "response": ["Lennard Pearce appeared in the first three series as Del and Rodney's elderly grandad. After Pearce's death in 1984, the show replaced Grandad with Uncle Albert, the boys' great uncle, played by Buster Merryfield. From 1988 onwards, the show features regular characters in Del Boy and Rodney's love interests, Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively. Other recurring characters include car dealer Boycie (John Challis), road sweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray), Boycie's wife Marlene (Sue Holderness), and pub landlord Mike (Kenneth MacDonald).", "The plots of many early episodes were primarily self-contained, with few plot-lines mentioned again, but the show developed a story arc and an ongoing episodic dimension in later series. Del and Rodney's quest for love is a recurring theme, which eventually resulted in them finding long-term love in the form of Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong) respectively; Del also has a son with Raquel, Damien (played by five actors, most recently Ben Smith). The Trotters finally become millionaires, lose their fortune, and then regain some of it.", "* Raquel Turner (Tessa Peake-Jones) \u2014 Raquel was introduced because Sullivan wanted more female characters and for Del to start meeting more mature women. Her first appearance, in \"Dates\", was intended to be a one-off, but she was written in again a year later and thereafter became a permanent cast member. A trained singer and actress whose career never took off, she met Del through a dating agency, but they fell out over her part-time job as a stripper, before getting together again. This time she moved in with Del, helping to calm him, and they had a son together, named Damien. As the character unfolded, it was revealed that she was previously married to Del's rival, DCI Roy Slater."]}, {"page": "The Two Gentlemen of Verona", "response": ["In 1983, the play was adapted for the BBC Television Shakespeare series, as the fourth episode of the sixth season. Directed by Don Taylor, it starred Tyler Butterworth as Proteus, John Hudson as Valentine, Tessa Peake-Jones as Julia and Joanne Pearce as Silvia. For the most part, the adaptation is taken verbatim from the First Folio, with some very minor differences. For example, omitted lines include the Duke's \"Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested\" (3.1.34), and Julia's \"Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine\" (4.4.189). Other differences include a slightly different opening scene to that indicated in the text. Whereas the play seems to open with Valentine and Proteus in mid-conversation, the adaptation begins with Mercatio and Eglamour attempting to formally woo Julia; Mercatio by showing her a coffer overflowing with gold coins, Eglamour by displaying a parchment detailing his ancestry. Neither Eglamour nor Mercatio appear in the text. However, there is no dialogue in this scene, and the first words spoken are the same as in the text (\"Cease to persuade my loving Proteus\"). Eglamour is also present in the final scene, albeit once again without any dialogue, and, additionally, the capture of Silvia and the flight of Eglamour is seen, as opposed to merely being described. The music for the episode was created by Anthony Rooley, who wrote new arrangements of works from Shakespeare's own time, such as John Dowland's \"Lachrimae\". Performed by The Consort of Musicke, other musicians whose music was used include William Byrd, Thomas Campion, Anthony Holborne, John Johnson, Thomas Morley and Orazio Vecchi."]}, {"page": "What the Butler Saw (play)", "response": ["* Tessa Peake-Jones \u2013 Geraldine Barclay"]}, {"page": "Tessa", "response": ["* Tessa Peake-Jones (born 1957), English actress"]}, {"page": "Barbara Keogh", "response": ["Latterly, Keogh worked alongside Bob Hoskins, Helen Mirren and Pete Postlethwaite in The Duchess of Malfi and toured in Sisterly Feelings with Peter Sallis, Trudie Styler, Tessa Peake-Jones and Bryan Pringle."]}, {"page": "So Haunt Me", "response": ["Peter Rokeby (played by George Costigan) loses his job as advertising copywriter, and resolves to become a freelance writer.
