Unable to secure financing from the Arts Council, Potter invested \u00a3500,000 in the production; BBC Films provided the rest of the capital. The film was not given a cinema release owing to a lack of interest from distributors and remained unseen until after Potter's death.

The series was adapted from Masefield's novel by Alan Seymour, directed by Renny Rye and produced by Paul Stone.", "Director Renny Rye was at that time on staff in the BBC Children's department at Television Centre, but had previous experience from the drama department, so was chosen by Edward Barnes to direct what would be what would be one of their most ambitious children's dramas to date. With a large number of effects shots, coupled with extensive location filming, the production was the most expensive children's drama the BBC had yet created, costing more than \u00a31 million in 1984.", "Railway station scenes were filmed at  and  on the steam heritage Severn Valley Railway; Tewkesbury became the fictional Tatchester; the bishop's children's party was recorded at Kinlet Hall, Shropshire (the location of Moffats Independent School, whose pupils and staff served as extras); the interior of Hereford Cathedral and its choir were featured extensively in the final episode (although the exterior of \"Tatchester Cathedral\" was Tewkesbury Abbey). Exterior shots of Abner Brown's theological college were filmed at Eastnor Castle, near Ledbury, Herefordshire. The snowy mountainous landscape of King Arthur's castle was filmed at the Peel of Lumphanan, Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire. During filming, the crew were almost snowed in by 12-foot blizzards. Renny Rye recalls: \"We could hardly use any of the locations I'd recced because we couldn't get out of the hotel. Nearly all the locations were unreachable because the snow was so thick (which is why it looks quite magical in the film), so virtually all of it was shot in the hotel gardens.\"", "To play Kay Harker, the main child protagonist, two hundred children were auditioned. Director Renny Rye recalls: \"My purist notion was that children's imagination was so great they could do it better if they hadn't been tutored. So I went round lots of schools and saw children from many, many schools.\"  Devin Stanfield was chosen on account of having \"a good face without seeming too modern or too handsome...the demands of filming called for someone with a great deal of stamina [with] a ready imagination, especially as he'd be called upon to react to invisible delights that would only afterwards be electronically added to the film.\" Stanfield was the grandson of the actor Leslie Sands and had previously had a few small parts in television programmes.", "The kindly Punch and Judy man Cole Hawlings was played by Patrick Troughton, famous for his portrayal of the Second Doctor in Doctor Who between 1966 and 1969. Renny Rye said that Troughton \"was my favourite Doctor Who...[he] had a quality that is unsurpassed, I think, as someone to pull you into a tale.\" A Blue Peter feature at the time connected Cole Hawlings to the actor's earlier role, observing that Troughton was once again playing a mysterious, scruffy time traveller."]}]}}
