Kazuo Miyagawa, as Daiei Film's cameraman, invented bleach bypass for Ichikawa's film, inspired by the color rendition in the original release of Moby-Dick (1956), printed using dye-transfer Technicolor, and was achieved through the use of an additional black and white overlay. Actually, this is a throwback to pre-1944 Technicolor, which incorporated a silver-containing \"blank receiver\" with the silver image printed from the green separation negative, but at 50-percent density, upon which the color dyes were imprinted by utilizing \"imbibition\"; this concept may have been employed here, but at a different density. Despite this early foray into the technique, it remained overlooked for the most part until its use by Roger Deakins for the movie 1984. The effect has subsequently become a regular development tool in labwork, and has remained in widespread use. Practitioners include cinematographers Rodrigo Prieto, Remi Adefarasin, Darius Khondji, Dariusz Wolski, Walter Carvalho,  Oliver Stapleton, Newton Thomas Sigel, Park Gok-ji, Shane Hurlbut, Steven Soderbergh (as \"Peter Andrews\"), Tom Stern, Vittorio Storaro, and Janusz Kami\u0144ski (notably on Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report)."]}, {"page": "Ned Kelly (2003 film)", "response": ["|Oliver Stapleton"]}, {"page": "My Beautiful Laundrette", "response": ["The film marked the first time Oliver Stapleton was in charge of cinematography in one of Frears' projects.

Normally the assistant director will call out \"check the gate\" when the director is ready to move on to the next shot. The crew will wait until the focus puller calls out \"gate is clean.\" If the gate is not clean, it will be cleaned with orangewood sticks and canned air and the crew will take the shot again. A good camera crew usually checks all cameras and magazines during equipment checkout with \"scratch tests\" using fogged film rolls \u2014 this will catch out any possible scratch or hair problems caused by faulty equipment. However, a variety of other factors including environment, humidity, type of film stock, camera position, film ridging, and lacing can each be responsible for a \"hair in the gate\". Generally, skilled crew and regularly inspected tested equipment make this a rare occurrence, and it is not unheard of for assistants to go for months without seeing one, even on large-scale shoots.
