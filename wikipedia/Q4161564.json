She sang at the start of regular broadcasts of the BBC Television Service on 2 November 1936.\nAfter an early start as a child actress, and training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, she became a member of the Old Vic, from 1928 to 1930, appearing in a wide range of roles, predominantly in Shakespeare's plays, but also those of Sheridan, Moli\u00e8re and Shaw. Her performance in her first singing role so impressed the composer Richard Addinsell, that he secured her the leading role in the West End adaptation of Priestley's The Good Companions in 1931.\nAfter she left the Old Vic in 1930, Dixon played occasionally in non-musical plays, but, in general, her career was on the musical stage, starring in shows by Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Vivian Ellis and others. Later, she became well known for her appearances in pantomime. Her last appearance, before she retired, was in the West End musical Belinda Fair in 1949.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1949 in music", "response": ["* Belinda Fair London production opened at the Strand Theatre on June 30 and ran for 131 performances.

Donald Wolfit, who loathed him and was himself disliked by his colleagues, was dropped, as was Adele Dixon.Croall (2000), p. 134 Gielgud was uncertain of the suitability of the most prominent new recruit, Ralph Richardson, but Williams was sure that after this season Gielgud would move on; he saw Richardson as a potential replacement. The two actors had little in common. Richardson recalled, \"He was a kind of brilliant butterfly, while I was a very gloomy sort of boy\",Croall (2011), p. 128 and \"I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn't like him.\" The first production of the season was Henry IV, Part 1, in which Gielgud as Hotspur had the best of the reviews.Croall (2000), p. 135 Richardson's notices, and the relationship of the two leading men, improved markedly when Gielgud, who was playing Prospero in The Tempest, helped Richardson with his performance as Caliban:"]}, {"page": "Adele (given name)", "response": ["* Adele Dixon (1908\u20131992), English actor"]}, {"page": "Anything Goes", "response": ["|Adele Dixon"]}, {"page": "Arthur Schwartz", "response": ["*\"I See Your Face Before Me\", introduced by Jack Buchanan, Evelyn Laye, and Adele Dixon in the musical Between the Devil (1937) and recorded by Frank Sinatra in his In the Wee Small Hours (1955) album and by Doris Day on her Day by Night (1957) album."]}, {"page": "Howard Dietz", "response": ["*\"I See Your Face Before Me\" (music by Schwartz).
