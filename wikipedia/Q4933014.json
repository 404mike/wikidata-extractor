Only Bob Kerr from that group was interested, so he left the Bonzos in order to help Stephens form a touring version of The New Vaudeville Band, which included original session drummer Henri Harrison.

In fact although they were now exclusively managed by Gerry Bron, The Bonzos were invited to perform live as the New Vaudeville Band in order to capitalise on the fictional group's recent chart success with \"Winchester Cathedral\"\u2014an offer The Bonzos immediately declined in favour of retaining their own artistic control.Richie Unterberger (2000) \"Urban Spacemen and Wayfaring Strangers\" 109\u2013121(San Francisco: Miller Freeman)  However, Bob Kerr happily agreed to help form a real New Vaudeville Band, allegedly taking the bulk of his former bandmates' stage act with him, a move which finally forced The Bonzos' hand over the change of direction (Kerr later went on to create his own long-standing early Bonzos/Vaudevilles-style band, Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band, which included other ex-Bonzos Sam Spoons and Vernon Bowhay-Nowell in its future line-ups). According to Neil Innes, The Bonzos had learned a salutary lesson about the pitfalls of show business: ", "Our trumpeter then was Bob Kerr, great player, and a fun guy. But he was friends with (songwriter and producer) Geoff Stephens, who'd made \"Winchester Cathedral\" with session men. And he knew Bob, so he rang Bob up saying: 'What am I going to do? \"Winchester Cathedral\"'s a hit, and I've got no band to promote it.'  So Bob came, flushed with excitement, to the rest of us at our digs, saying, 'We can be The New Vaudeville Band!' and we said, 'Certainly not, no way!' So, Bob couldn't understand this, so we said, 'Well, go, you go and do it then, if you want to. Go, never darken our towels again!', kind of thing. But the next thing, on Top of the Pops, was the New Vaudeville Band, with the singer looking exactly like Viv, in a sort of lam\u00e9 suit, all the musicians wearing the kind of suits we were wearing, with two-tone shoes. They'd even nicked the cutout comic speaking balloons, which we made out of hardboard, with a fret saw, and painted white, and then wrote, 'Wow, I'm really expressing myself!' to hold over somebody's head while they did a saxophone solo. There was the entire image, and for the next few weeks people were saying to us, 'Hey, you're like that New Vaudeville Band!' And that's when I think Legs Larry Smith said, \"Well, look\u00a0...'\u2014he'd always been arguing for doing some more modern material, so we all said, 'Right, now we start writing our own stuff.' \"Neil Innes, quoted in the radio documentary Big Shot: A Journey Through the Canyons of Vivian Stanshall's Mind (BBC, 2001)", "On 28 January 2006 most of the surviving members of the band played a concert at the London Astoria, to celebrate the band's official 40th anniversary. Neil Innes, \"Legs\" Larry Smith, Roger Ruskin Spear, Rodney Slater, Bob Kerr, Sam Spoons and Vernon Dudley Bowhay-Nowell appeared. There were also a number of special guests attempting with various degrees of success to be Vivian Stanshall, one of two members of the band not still living (the other being bass player Dennis Cowan).  The various Stanshall impersonators included Stephen Fry, Ade Edmondson, Phill Jupitus and Paul Merton (who needed to read the words to \"Monster Mash\" from cue cards at the show). The classic Bonzo stage antics were in evidence, including performances on the Theremin Leg and Trouser Press. The show was filmed and was broadcast on BBC Four and also released on DVD in May 2006.", "Whilst Vernon allied with Bob Kerr to play as 'Bonzomania', Roger, Rodney and Sam remained together and joined up with pianist David Glasson (ex Whoopee Band) and performed as Three Bonzos and a Piano. Since October 2008, they have undertaken regular gigs.  They have included appearances from \"Legs\" Larry Smith and Vernon Dudley Bowhay-Nowell. Three Bonzos and a Piano launched a new CD Hair of the Dog at the Bloomsbury Theatre, London on 6 February 2010, featuring new numbers from all band members and some re-workings of older favourites.  Larry and Vernon were at the Bloomsbury gig. In 2012 they released another CD, Bum Notes.", "A configuration under the name 'Almost the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band' performed from 2012, more regularly featuring Legs and the now 82-year-old Vernon.  This grouping played their final gig together as a five piece, alongside Andy Roberts, Dave Glasson and the eleven-piece Keynsham Town Band in Milton Keynes. The following week, Sam Spoons' \"Bill Posters Will Be Band\" played their last, and the week after, \"Bob Kerr's Whoopee Band\" (with Vernon guesting) also disbanded. Spoons died on 27 September 2018 following a long illness.", "The band's onstage line-up varied, sometimes on a weekly basis, and they also invited a number of guest musicians into the recording studio.

Keith Moon, who became great friends with both Stanshall and Smith, played drums for part of The Bonzo's set at the 1969 Plumpton Festival (The Who were headlining that night). Moon also played drums for the majority of the Bonzos set at Bristol Locarno, using one drumstick and a brick. He was on a West Country tour with his valet, Dougal Butler who describes it in his book 'Full Moon'.
