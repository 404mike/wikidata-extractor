In some cases vast rural parishes were subdivided; in others, chapels of ease were provided in outlying rural areas distant from their parish church.  Victorian restoration of old churches took place across the district and was particularly extensive at Hailsham, Selmeston and Uckfield, where the buildings are now essentially 19th-century.  The era of large-scale churchbuilding (as opposed to restoration) in Wealden began in the late Georgian era with the opening of a new church in Frant, built between 1819 and 1822.  The year 1836, just before Victoria's reign started, was significant: William Moseley was responsible for new churches in Forest Row and Hadlow Down that year (although the latter was greatly reworked in 1913); and Danehill, a main-road village in Fletching parish, also received its first chapel of ease in 1836.  The present church of 1892 is by Bodley and Garner.  It is the Victorian era that is most associated with the increase in churchbuilding activity, though.Elleray 1981, p. 22.  A church in the outlying part of Withyham parish close to the growing town of Crowborough opened in 1839.  Four years later, a church was completed at Upper Dicker in Arlington parish; and prolific architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter's church at Nutley dates from 1845.  The churches at Eridge and Tidebrook date from 1852 and 1856 respectively.  James Piers St Aubyn designed a chapel of ease at Cross-in-Hand, the main settlement in Waldron parish, in 1863\u201364.  A former school was converted into a chapel of ease in Mark Cross, part of Rotherfield parish, in 1873, although it was soon granted its own parish.  A year later, work began on a church for the rapidly growing village of Polegate, and a church was built to serve the village of Horam in 1890.  Endowments by rich benefactors allowed churches to be built at High Hurstwood (1872) and Hammerwood (1880).  The wealthy Vicar of Brighton Arthur Wagner, who had a house in Buxted and established a convent there, also paid for the construction of a second church for the village in 1885\u201386.  Fairwarp's church, designed in 1881 by Major Rohde Hawkins, was substantially extended in the 20th century, funded by the Eckstein baronets.  Churches continued to be built throughout the 20th century.  Examples include Blackham (1902), Jarvis Brook (1906), Colemans Hatch (1913, by Arthur Blomfield), Heathfield town (1915), Bodle Street Green (1923, replacing a fire-damaged one), Stone Cross (1924; a chapel of ease in Westham parish), Alderbrook (1957), Broad Oak (1959), Lower Willingdon (1962) and Pevensey Bay (1968, replacing one of 1881).  In the east of Uckfield a tin tabernacle erected in 1904 was replaced by a combined church and sheltered housing development in 1971.", "|A church was erected in this hamlet in 1855, but there may have been an earlier chapel of ease (to Warbleton parish church) in the 1830s.
