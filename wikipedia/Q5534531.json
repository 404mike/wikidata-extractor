He asked Shephard's problem on the volumes of projected convex bodies, posed another problem on polyhedral nets, proved the Shephard\u2013Todd theorem in invariant theory of finite groups, began the study of complex polytopes, and classified the complex reflection groups.\nShephard earned his Ph.D. in 1954 from Queens' College, Cambridge, under the supervision of J. A. Todd. He was a professor of mathematics at the University of East Anglia until his retirement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Polytope", "response": ["In 1952 Geoffrey Colin Shephard generalised the idea as complex polytopes in complex space, where each real dimension has an imaginary one associated with it.
