He was also the second man to fly the Supermarine Spitfire after Vickers Aviation's chief test pilot, Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers.  After succeeding Summers as Vickers' chief test pilot, Quill test-flew every mark of Spitfire. Quill's work on the aircraft aided its development from a promising but untried prototype to become, with the Hawker Hurricane, an instrument of the Royal Air Force's victory in the Battle of Britain. The Spitfire later played a leading role in gaining Allied air superiority over Europe. Quill later wrote two books about the Spitfire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
