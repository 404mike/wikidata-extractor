Dame schools, which had existed long before, had shown the need for childcare of very young children for women who worked outside the home. The new infant schools were to provide a safe environment for these children as well as give them some educational advantages. Wilderspin's schools were based on the reform education theory of Swiss thinker Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.

Her sister Sophia Chichester became a widow a year after her marriage to John Chichester. She moved to live with Welch and together the sisters began to patronise religious radicalism and political unorthodoxy. As the ladies of the big house, charity was expected of them but the books and support the women gave to the weavers in their locality was subversive literature and they were opposed by the local clergy. They gave financial support to evangelical preachers, spiritual and political. They became friends of the reformer James Pierrepont Greaves as well as secularist George Jacob Holyoake and Robert Owen. It is hard to tell from correspondence who is writing because the sisters wrote as one, sharing their names on their letters."]}]}}
