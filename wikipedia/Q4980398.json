He also played three first-class matches for the Combined Services.\nIn 190 first-class matches, he scored 9,248 runs at 31.45, with 17 centuries, and best scores of 186 against Warwickshire and 181 against Essex. After several years of sporadic appearances, he became a first team regular in 1957, while his best season came in 1959, when he scored over 2,000 runs for the only time and helped Yorkshire, under Ronnie Burnet, win the County Championship.  He took ninety one catches and seven wickets at 16.00 with his rarely seen medium pace, including 4 for 34 against Surrey.  His time in the game was ending as one day cricket began, but he played two matches in the Gillette Cup in his last season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Yorkshire by contrast had a poor season, though it could partly be excused by the impact of Test calls, injuries and Trueman's national service. They dropped to twelfth place in the County Championship, which was then their lowest-ever position.Webber, p. 87. Ray Illingworth, who had made only a handful of appearances previously, was an ever-present in Yorkshire's championship team in 1953 and other young prospects making progress were Mike Cowan, Doug Padgett, Bryan Stott and Ken Taylor. Otherwise, the mainstays were as before: Yardley, Hutton, Lowson, Lester, Halliday, Watson, Wilson, Sutcliffe, Brennan and Wardle. Close played in only two matches and Trueman in ten. Bill Holdsworth made 14 appearances and Bill Foord, in his last season before finally deciding to be a schoolteacher, made 22."]}, {"page": "Playfair Cricket Annual", "response": ["* 1960: Abbas Ali Baig, Trevor Bailey, Ken Barrington, Ronnie Burnet, Colin Cowdrey, Ray Illingworth, Jim Parks, Geoff Pullar, MJK Smith, Jim Stewart, Bryan Stott"]}, {"page": "George Douglas Verity", "response": ["He was educated at Littlemoor Primary School in Rawdon, alongside future Yorkshire cricketers Brian Close and Bryan Stott, and at Woodhouse Grove School at Apperley Bridge, near Bradford.
