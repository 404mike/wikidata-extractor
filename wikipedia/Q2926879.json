Maddox (born 1969) is a British literary novelist and journalist who is best known for his novel My Little Blue Dress (2001) and for his satirical magazine essays.\nAfter graduating from Harvard University in 1992, Maddox began his career reviewing books for The New York Times Book Review and The Washington Post Book World. In early 1996, he was appointed to an editorship at Spy magazine and within a few months he was promoted to editor-in-chief, a position he held until the magazine shut down in 1998. Maddox wrote My Little Blue Dress between 1999 and 2001. Since its publication, he has focused on writing satirical essays for magazines such as GEAR and Travel + Leisure; he also contributes a monthly humor column to Discover magazine called \"Blinded by Science\", drawing on his early exposure to science and technology. Maddox is likewise a contributing editor to the American edition of The Week magazine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice", "response": ["In the London Review of Books, Amit Chaudhuri praised the book: \"Hitchens's investigations have been a solitary and courageous endeavour. The book is extremely well-written, with a sanity and sympathy that tempers its irony.\" He commented that the portrait \"is in danger of assuming the one-dimensionality of the Mother Teresa of her admirers\", and that he finished the book without much more of an idea of the character and motivations of Mother Teresa. In The New York Times Bruno Maddox wrote: \"Like all good pamphlets... it is very short, zealously over-written and rails wild\". He called its arguments \"rather convincing\", made \"with consummate style.\" The Sunday Times said: \"A dirty job but someone had to do it. By the end of this elegantly written, brilliantly argued piece of polemic, it is not looking good for Mother Teresa.\"Robert Kee, \"Gentle arrogance\", The Sunday Times (UK), 10 November 1995"]}, {"page": "John Maddox", "response": ["Maddox lived in London, and spent time at his cottage near Brecon in Wales, where he and his wife, Brenda Maddox, were involved in the local community.
