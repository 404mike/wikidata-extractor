The character has been variously depicted as articulate and sophisticated as in the original novels, and as a noble savage with limited language skills such as in the films featuring Johnny Weissmuller.\nCreated by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel Tarzan of the Apes (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and subsequently in 23 sequels, several books by Burroughs and other authors, and innumerable works in other media, both authorized and unauthorized.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tarzan of the Apes", "response": ["Ultimately, Tarzan travels to find Jane in Wisconsin, USA where he rescues her from a fire. Tarzan learns the bitter news that she has become engaged to William Clayton. Meanwhile, clues from his parents' cabin have enabled D'Arnot to prove Tarzan's true identity as John Clayton II, the Earl of Greystoke.  Instead of reclaiming his inheritance from William, Tarzan chooses rather to conceal and renounce his heritage for the sake of Jane's happiness."]}, {"page": "William Clayton", "response": ["William Clayton may refer to:", "* William Clayton (Liverpool MP) (died 1715), Member of Parliament for Liverpool, 1698\u20131708", "* Sir William Clayton, 1st Baronet (died 1744), Member of Parliament for Bletchingley, 1715\u20131744", "* William Clayton, 1st Baron Sundon (1671\u20131752), MP for Woodstock, St Albans, Westminster, Plympton Erle and St Mawes", "* William Clayton (died 1783) (c. 1718\u20131783), MP for Bletchingley, 1745\u20131761, and Great Marlow, 1761\u20131783", "* Sir William Clayton, 4th Baronet (1762\u20131834), Member of Parliament for Great Marlow, 1783\u20131790", "* Sir William Clayton, 5th Baronet (1786\u20131866), Member of Parliament for Great Marlow, 1832\u20131842", "* William Clayton (colonist) (1632\u20131689), acting Governor of the Pennsylvania Colony, 1684\u20131685", "* William Clayton (Mormon) (1814\u20131879), Mormon pioneer", "* William Clayton (architect) (1823\u20131877), prominent New Zealand architect", "* William Clayton (publisher), publisher of Astounding Stories", "* William Clayton (Arrowverse), a character in the TV series Arrow"]}]}}
