Hollies played all his first-class cricket career for Warwickshire, taking 2,323 wickets at less than 21 apiece.\nCricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted: \"Hollies was one of cricket's most extraordinary characters, whose meagre thirteen Tests in no way reflected his contribution to the game.  He was a fastish leg-break bowler who rarely had much use for the googly.\" Bateman added: \"loquacious, with a rich seam of Black Country humour, he was an immensely respected and hard-working cricketer\".\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
