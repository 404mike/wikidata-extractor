He won his second League title in 1947\u201348. After the arrival of Ted Platt in 1950, Swindin had to share the goalkeeper's spot for 1949\u201350, but played in both the 1950 and 1952 FA Cup Finals; Arsenal won the former against Liverpool, but lost to Newcastle United in the latter."]}, {"page": "Jack Kelsey", "response": ["After an entire season in the reserves, he returned to the side during the 1952\u201353 season, sharing goalkeeping duties with Swindin and Ted Platt; he made 29 appearances in a side that won the First Division title. With a rugged build and consistently solid catching, Kelsey managed to fully oust Swindin from the side (Swindin making only two appearances in 1953\u201354) and went on to be Arsenal's first-choice goalkeeper for the next eight seasons; only a broken arm sustained in an FA Cup tie against Sheffield United in 1959 put Kelsey out of the Arsenal side for any considerable amount of time, with Jim Standen taking over in the meantime."]}, {"page": "Platt (surname)", "response": ["*Ted Platt (1921\u20131996), English professional goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "Norman Uprichard", "response": ["Uprichard played in goal for Glenavon and later for Distillery before signing for Arsenal in 1948 for \u00a31,500.
