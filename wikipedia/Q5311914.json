The former owner of the estate had been very popular for his hospitality, while Crabbe's lifestyle was much more quiet and private. His solace here was the company of his friend Dudley Long North and his fellow Whigs who lived nearby. Crabbe soon sent his two sons George and John to school in Aldeburgh. After four years at Parham, the Crabbes moved to a home in Great Glemham, Suffolk, placed at his disposal by Dudley North. The family remained here for four or five years. In 1796 their third son, Edmund died at the age of six. This was a heavy blow to Sarah who began suffering from a nervous disorder from which she never recovered. Crabbe, a devoted husband, tended her with exemplary care until her death in 1813. Robert Southey, writing about Crabbe to his friend, Neville White, in 1808, said \"It was not long before his wife became deranged, and when all this was told me by one who knew him well, five years ago, he was still almost confined in his own house, anxiously waiting upon this wife in her long and hopeless malady. A sad history! It is no wonder that he gives so melancholy a picture of human life.\""]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*Dudley Long North"]}, {"page": "Banbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1796 || Dudley Long North", "|| 1808 || Dudley Long North"]}, {"page": "Richmond (Yorks) (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|Dudley Long North||Whig"]}, {"page": "Newtown (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Dudley Long North", "| Dudley Long North"]}, {"page": "King Edward VI School, Bury St Edmunds", "response": ["*Dudley Long North \u2013 politician"]}, {"page": "Dudley North", "response": ["*Dudley Long North (1748\u20131829), English Whig politician, great-grandson of the economist"]}, {"page": "Glemham Hall", "response": ["In 1791 Humphry Repton produced plans for the park; he commented on the H-shaped house in his works.
