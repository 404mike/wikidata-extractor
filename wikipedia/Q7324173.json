His name is associated with the Bird\u2013Meertens formalism, a calculus for deriving programs from specifications in a functional programming style.\nFormerly, Bird was at the University of Reading.\nHe was a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, supports, and maintains the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Algebraic data type", "response": ["For the purposes of the List example, these two formulations are not significantly different; but the second form allows expressing so-called nested data types, i.e., those where the recursive type differs parametrically from the original.
