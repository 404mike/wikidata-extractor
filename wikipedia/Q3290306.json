On 7 January 2012, Reading were knocked out of the F.A. Cup by League One side Stevenage, after losing 1\u20130 at home to a Darius Charles goal in the 20th minute. On 9 January 2012, it was announced that Alex McCarthy had signed a contract extension until 2015, and also gone out on loan to Ipswich Town for three months. On 12 January 2012 Reading announced the signing of Republic of Ireland U21 international Karl Sheppard from Shamrock Rovers on a free transfer. Reading returned to winning form on 14 January away at Watford. Watford took the lead through a Shaun Cummings own goal after 29 minutes, but Jimmy Kebe fired home the equaliser on 42 to see the sides in level at half time.

The Blades also agreed a deal to take two young midfielders, John Fleck and Kyle Hutton, on loan from Rangers for the remainder of the season, but the deal subsequently fell through due to issues with the paperwork involved.  The team kicked off September by crushing Bury 4\u20130 at Bramall Lane, and then travelled to Scunthorpe United where they maintained their unbeaten start after coming from behind to grab a 1\u20131 draw.  Off the field the restructuring of the club continued with the appointment of former Blades player Julian Winter as Chief Executive to replace the departing Trevor Birch.  Danny Wilson added to his defensive options by signing Marcus Williams on a months loan from Reading, with the defender making his d\u00e9but only hours later, although he was unable to prevent the Blades from crashing to their first league defeat of the season as they were trounced 3\u20130 at home by Huddersfield Town.  Despite this setback the Blades quickly returned to winning ways, reversing the previous scoreline to crush Colchester United 3\u20130 at Bramall Lane.  The month ended on a low note however as the team suffered a shock defeat at struggling Wycombe Wanderers, although they still managed to hold onto second place in the table.", "October started no better for the Blades as they were easily beaten 2\u20130 at home by league leaders Charlton Athletic and needed a last second goal to progress in the Football League Trophy as they struggled against League Two side Rotherham United. Meanwhile, Danny Wilson boosted his squad ahead of the Steel City derby, with Marcus Williams agreeing to stay on loan for a further two months and Matt Phillips and Billy Clarke arriving for a month each from Blackpool. The new arrivals failed to halt the disappointing run of results however as the Blades let a 2\u20130 lead slip to end up drawing with their cross\u2013city rivals.  Despite this disappointment the team bounced back to score an emphatic away win at Preston a few days later with both new signing Matt Phillips and old hand Lee Williamson netting two goals apiece.  With increased competition for first team places, youngsters Danny Philliskirk and Corey Gregory were allowed to go out on loan to Oxford United and Hucknall Town respectively; swiftly followed by Connor Brown who joined Eastwood Town on a months deal.  Back in the league, the disappointing results continued as United threw away a lead once again, allowing ten-men Leyton Orient to snatch a draw with the last kick of the game.  Once again the Blades quickly responded to the setback by beating fellow promotion rivals MK Dons 2\u20131 at Bramall Lane, but then conspired to throw away yet more points, allowing Exeter City to come from behind twice in the closing minutes of the next game to snatch a 4\u20134 draw.", "With the transfer window reopening in January, Danny Wilson's first signing was the return of former loan player Marcus Williams who agreed a two and a half year deal.  The New Year started disappointingly as the Blades crashed to their first defeat since the beginning of November as they were beaten 3\u20132 at Carlisle United. Following Danny Wilson being awarded 'League One Manager of the Month' for December, United soon got back to winning ways when they returned to home soil.  The team saw off Salisbury City 3\u20131 in the third round of the FA Cup, the first meeting ever between the two clubs, and then outclassed Yeovil Town a few days later, hitting four without reply including a brace from Lee Williamson and a first ever club goal from captain Michael Doyle. With Danny Wilson looking to freshen up his squad United rewarded four of its younger players with contract extensions, with Erik T\u00f8nne and David McAllister set to remain with the club until the summer of 2014, and youth team players Jordan Chapell and Jack Adams agreeing new deals until the end of the season. In a busy day the club saw the departure of Elian Parrino as his short term deal came to an end, and then allowed McAllister to join League Two club Shrewsbury Town on a months loan, with manager Danny Wilson bemoaning a lack of reserve games under the current system.  The following week Wilson continued to overhaul the squad with reserve keeper Mihkel Aksalu leaving the club on mutual terms, but was boosted by 'fans favourite' James Beattie agreeing a deal to remain at Bramall Lane until the end of the season. Meanwhile, back in the league the Blades then continued their fine run of form, completing their second league double of the week, as they hit three without reply away at Bury, but that form deserted them for a top-of-the-table trip to Charlton Athletic where a bad tempered match resulted in both teams being reduced to ten men and a 1\u20130 loss for United.  Seven days later United suffered their first back-to-back defeats of the season as they crashed out of the FA Cup at the hands of Birmingham City. With the transfer window about to close Bramall Lane was relatively quite on deadline day; Danny Philliskirk was handed an extended deal, and striker Will Hoskins signed on loan from Brighton & Hove Albion until the end of the season, whilst youngster Erik T\u00f8nne was allowed to join Yorkshire neighbours York City, also until the end of the season.

The first round of the FA Cup saw the Blades progressed after a 3\u20132 victory over Colchester United, before Joe Ironside was allowed to join Halifax Town on loan until 5 January.

Taylor was quickly followed by fellow striker Marlon King whose short-term contract was terminated at the end of the year. Youngster Jahmal Smith joined Harrogate Town on a youth loan. Having picked up an injury during the game against Oldham, Aidan White cut short his loan spell to return to Leeds for treatment. United's unbeaten run did not last into the new year, as despite leading 1\u20130 at half time, they were beaten 2\u20131 away at Walsall. As January began Aaron Barry returned from a successful loan spell at Dumbarton having played over 20 times for the Sons, before United knocked Premiership side Aston Villa out of the FA Cup following a 2\u20131 third round at Villa Park. The following week saw a flurry of arrivals and departures as Elliott Whitehouse returned from his loan spell at York City, whilst Joe Ironside returned from Halifax Town, Callum McFadzean returned from Chesterfield and youngster Jahmal Smith joined Harrogate Town on a months loan. Conor Coady then extended his loan with United until the end of February, and Darryl Westlake extended his loan with Mansfield Town until the end of the season. The following day Malachy Brannigan was unveiled as the club's new managing director, reuniting with Nigel Clough, with whom he had worked at Derby County. The week concluded with United signing Billy Paynter on loan for the rest of the season from South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers, whilst Marcus Williams left permanently for Scunthorpe United on a free transfer, and Sean McGinty joined Northampton Town on a months loan. For the second league fixture in a row United let a lead slip to lose 2\u20131 at Notts County, and then as Nigel Clough continued to revamp the squad, Febian Brandy was allowed to rejoin Walsall on loan for the remainder of the season, only six months after leaving the West Midlands club, and Florent Cuvelier joined Port Vale for a similar period. In their next match, United drew 2\u20132 at home with Yorkshire rivals Bradford City despite having held a two-goal lead at half time. 24 January saw United make a number of signings, bringing in John Brayford on loan for the remainder of the season from Cardiff City, signing Stefan Scougall from Livingston for an undisclosed fee, and agreeing a loan-swap deal with Blackpool that saw Bob Harris sign for a month with United, with Tony McMahon moving in the opposite direction. In the fifth round of the FA Cup United held Premier League Fulham to a 1\u20131 draw at Bramall Lane, despite being reduced to ten men for most of the second half following Michael Doyle's red card. On 30 January, McMahon agreed a permanent switch to Blackpool, after the west-coast club decided to take up the remainder of his contract.
