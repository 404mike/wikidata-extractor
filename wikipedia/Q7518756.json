Archembald's grandson, Archembald fitz Stephen le Fleming, came to Ireland with King Henry II of England in 1171 and participated in Hugh de Lacy's plantation of the kingdom of Kingdom of Mide. He was the great-great grandfather of Simon. Simon was the son of Sir Baldwin Fleming, and Maud de Geneville, daughter of Simon de Geneville of Culmullin  and Joan Fitz Leones. The elder  Simon was a younger son of  Geoffrey de Geneville, 1st Baron Geneville,  Justiciar of Ireland.\nSimon was a member of the Irish Parliament of 1370. He became the lord of Slane in 1335 on the death of his father. In 1346 he served as Commissioner of the Peace in County Meath.  In 1352 Slane was declared forfeit to the Crown, but Simon recovered it three  years later. He had been knighted before 1365.  He was in close attendance on Lionel of Antwerp, younger son of King Edward III,  the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, during his years in Ireland. \nHe spent much of his time  in England, and acquired extensive  lands in Devon and Cornwall (he was related by marriage to a number of prominent  families in those counties, notably the Bassets  and Champernownes).\nIn 1363-4 he was a prominent member of the \"reform party\", which campaigned against the widespread corruption  and maladministration of the  Irish Government: he was part of a powerful delegation sent by the Irish House of Commons to England to outline their grievances, and  King Edward III  appointed him to a royal commission to consider what reforms to government were necessary. The reform party had some success:  in particular they secured  the removal from office, for a time, of Thomas de Burley, the notoriously corrupt  Lord Chancellor of Ireland.\nSimon married Cecily Champernowne, daughter of Sir Thomas Champernowne,  of Modbury, Devon and his wife Eleanor de Rohart.  The Champernownes were  a distinguished and long-established  Devonshire family: notable later members included Kat Ashley, n\u00e9e Champernowne, the much-loved governess of Queen Elizabeth I, and Sir Walter Raleigh, whose mother was a Champernowne.\nSimon  was succeeded by his son, Thomas, born c. 1358, died c.1434/1435. He also had at least two daughters, Matilda, who married Luke Cusack, and Margaret, who married Sir William Basset  of Tehidy, Cornwall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of peers 1370\u20131379", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Baron Slane (1370)||Simon Fleming, 1st Baron Slane||1370||1370||New creation; died"]}, {"page": "Baron Slane", "response": ["Succeeding Flemings were Stephen, (died \u20131214) and Baldwin (died 1260).
