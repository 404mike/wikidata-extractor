The Purcells were an Anglo-Irish family who had arrived in England at the time of the Norman conquest and settled in Ireland by 1172. John Purcell, junior was educated at Trinity College, Dublin (1790) and trained in the law at the Middle Temple (1792) and King's Inns (1793). He was called to the Irish bar in 1796, but never practised.\nHe married in 1801 his cousin Mary Frances, the daughter and heiress of his uncle John Fitzgerald of Little Island, Waterford, who also had estates at Pendleton in Lancashire and Gayton, Staffordshire. The couple lived at the Bredfield House, also known as the White House, Bredfield, near Woodbridge, Suffolk and had three sons and five daughters. In 1810 Mary Frances, whose elder brother had died in 1807, inherited her great-aunt's estate, including the 3,000-acre manor of Naseby Wooleys, Northamptonshire. In 1823 he erected an obelisk to mark the site of the battle of Naseby. When she then inherited her father's estates in 1818, Purcell took the name of Fitzgerald. His wealthy wife spent much of her time circulating in London and Brighton society, travelling in a yellow carriage pulled by black horses, whilst Fitzgerald preferred the life of a Suffolk squire. He was appointed High Sheriff of Suffolk for 1824\u201325.\nThe following year he leased Wherstead Lodge, near Ipswich and also bought property in Seaford, Sussex in order to stand for Parliament in 1826 as candidate for the Seaford constituency. He was duly elected, sitting until the constituency was abolished in the Great Reform Act of 1832. In the late 1820s he commissioned Robert Stephenson, (brother of George Stephenson), to commence coal-mining on his Lancashire estate, but fraud and flooding made the Pendleton Colliery venture unsuccessful and he was forced to file for bankruptcy. He and his wife were now formally separated and she left to live at Little Island, where she died in 1855. In 1835 he moved into Boulge Hall, near Woodbridge. His younger son Edward Fitzgerald, the poet and translator of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, lived in a cottage in the grounds.\nIn 1838\u201339 he served as High Sheriff of County Waterford.\nOn his death in 1852, his remaining estates were inherited by his eldest son John, a lay preacher, who took the name Purcell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1775", "response": ["** John Fitzgerald, British Member of Parliament (d. 1852)"]}, {"page": "John Fitzgerald", "response": ["*John Fitzgerald (center) (born 1948), former Dallas Cowboys center", "*John Fitzgerald (quarterback) (born 1975), former quarterback with the af2's Austin Wranglers", "*John Fitzgerald (offensive guard), former University of Central Oklahoma lineman", "*John Fitzgerald (footballer) (born 1984), Irish footballer", "*John Fitzgerald (soccer) (born 1968), Canadian soccer player, businessman & corporate lawyer", "*John Fitzgerald (Rochester Broncos pitcher) (1866\u20131892), pitcher for the 1890 Rochester Broncos", "*John Fitzgerald (Boston Reds pitcher) (1870\u20131921), pitcher for the 1891 Boston Reds", "*John Fitzgerald (1950s pitcher) (born 1933), pitcher for the 1958 San Francisco Giants", "*John Fitzgerald (catcher), Negro league baseball catcher", "*John Fitzgerald (Australian footballer, born 1961), former Geelong player", "*John Fitzgerald (Australian footballer, born 1901) (1901\u20131987), Fitzroy player", "*John Fitzgerald (tennis) (born 1960), Australian tennis player", "*John Fitzgerald (pentathlete) (born 1948), American modern pentathlete", "*John Fitzgerald (rugby union) (born 1961), former Irish rugby union international player", "*John Fitzgerald (1775\u20131852), British MP for Seaford 1826\u201332", "*Sir John Fitzgerald (brewer) (1857\u20131930), Lord Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne, England, 1914\u20131915", "*John Fitzgerald (Wisconsin) (c. 1827\u20131863), Wisconsin banker and politician", "*Jack Fitzgerald (politician) (John Fitzgerald, 1914\u20131994), Irish Labour Party politician", "*John Fitzgerald (Australian politician) (1864\u20131936), member of the South Australian House of Assembly", "*John Fitzgerald (governor), Irish soldier of the 17th century", "*John Fitzgerald (Medal of Honor) (1873\u20131948), American Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Fitzgerald (poet) (1927\u20132007), Welsh-language poet and Catholic philosopher", "*John Fitzgerald (priest), Dean of Cork, 1627\u201341", "*John Fitzgerald (computer scientist) (born 1965), British computer scientist and Chair of Formal Methods Europe", "*John Fitzgerald (soldier) (1817\u2013?), American soldier", "*John Fitzgerald (United States Coast Guard)"]}, {"page": "Boulge", "response": ["John Fitzgerald bought Boulge Hall in 1801 for his daughter Mary and her new husband, John Purcell (later John Fitzgerald), Edward's parents.

"]}, {"page": "Manchester Racecourse", "response": ["After the closure of the Kersal Moor course, racing was moved across the River Irwell to a site known as Castle Irwell, named after the large, castellated house on the site. The land was rented for \u00a3500 per annum on a twenty-year lease from John Fitzgerald, who was a Member of Parliament and the owner of Pendleton Colliery. The course, built on flat land in a meander of the river, was damp and boggy, prone to mist and the going was heavy. However, a large grandstand was erected, to seat over 1,000 spectators, and the course, being bounded by the river on three sides, was easier to manage than Kersal Moor. The whole course could be seen from the grandstand and from Castle Hill, across the river but the approaches to the course were guarded by toll-men. Richard Wright proctor wrote in 1862 ", "By 1898, John Fitzgerald had died and the Race Committee bought the Castle Irwell site from his executors. They then formed a Company and set about building a sports facility fit for the 20th Century. A high wall was built on the sides not bounded by the river; gardens and glazed galleries were built inside and there were trams to the main entrance. There was a luxurious club stand built in an eccentric amalgam of styles and the main entrance was adorned with dutch gables. The course was finally inaugurated on the Easter weekend of 1902. This first meeting was over jumps, with the principal event being the Lancashire Steeplechase, a handicap of \u00a31,750. This race was run until 1952. The first flat meeting was held in 1902 at Whitsuntide, featuring the Castle Irwell Inauguration Handicap, worth \u00a3500 to the winner. It was won by Vatel, ridden by Kempton Cannon."]}, {"page": "Broughton Suspension Bridge", "response": ["In 1826, John Fitzgerald, the wealthy owner of Castle Irwell House (later to become the site of the Manchester Racecourse), built, at his own expense, a  suspension bridge across the River Irwell between Lower Broughton and Pendleton. According to John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales (1870\u201372) all users of the bridge were required to pay a pontage to cross. The bridge was the only means of communication between the townships of Broughton and Pendleton and a source of great local pride, as the Menai Suspension Bridge had opened only that year and suspension bridges were then considered the \"new wonder of the age\".", "On 12 April 1831, the 60th Rifle Corps carried out an exercise on Kersal Moor under the command of Lieutenant Percy Slingsby Fitzgerald,London Gazette Issue 18750 published on 26 November 1830. Page 4 the son of John Fitzgerald, Member of Parliament and brother of the poet Edward FitzGerald. As a detachment of 74\u00a0men returned to barracks in Salford by way of the bridge, the soldiers, who were marching four abreast, felt it begin to vibrate in time with their footsteps. Finding the vibration amusing, some of them started to whistle a marching tune, and to \"humour it by the manner in which they stepped\", causing the bridge to vibrate even more. The head of the column had almost reached the Pendleton side when they heard \"a sound resembling an irregular discharge of firearms\". Immediately, one of the iron columns supporting the suspension chains on the Broughton side of the river fell towards the bridge, carrying with it a large stone from the pier to which it had been bolted. The corner of the bridge, no longer supported, then fell  into the river, throwing about forty of the soldiers into the water or against the chains. The river was low and the water only about two feet (60\u00a0cm) deep at that point. None of the men were killed, but twenty were injured, including six who suffered severe injuries including broken arms and legs, severe bruising, and contusions to the head."]}, {"page": "Pendleton Colliery", "response": ["== John Fitzgerald era =="]}, {"page": "John Fitzgerald (1775-1852)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Fitzgerald (1775\u20131852) "]}, {"page": "Augustus Frederick Ellis", "response": ["He stood for the Seaford constituency, a seat controlled by his father, in the 1826 general election.D.R.
