Terry Greenhough and Chris Morgan both made their first fiction sales to Science Fiction Monthly, and Garry Kilworth and David S. Garnett also had early sales to the magazine, but it was a difficult market to break into: in addition to the intense competition, it only published two or three stories per issue, and usually at least one would be by a well-known writer.  None of the winners of a short-story competition, run in 1974 with categories such as best foreign story and best Commonwealth story, went on to do any substantial work in the genre.  Well-known British writers who appeared in the magazine's page included Brian Aldiss, Christopher Priest, Ian Watson, Robert Holdstock, and Bob Shaw.
