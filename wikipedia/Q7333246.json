He compiled four centuries, 115 and 129* against Cambridge University, 122* against Derbyshire and 114 against Nottinghamshire.  He did not bowl in first-class cricket.\nOne of seven children and the son of a gamekeeper, he learned his early cricket with Farsley United C.C. and Bingley C.C. After his playing career drew to a close at Yorkshire, he played as a professional at several northern league clubs, including Holmfirth C.C., Nelson C.C. in Lancashire, Cudworth C.C. and Dobcross C.C. From 1885 to at least 1891 he was employed at, and probably landlord of, the New Inn, Farsley but, like  many professionals of his era, he fell upon hard times in his later years and died in poverty stricken circumstances.\nGrimshaw died in Farsley on 18 January 1911, and was buried at Calverley in Leeds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Recreation Ground (Holbeck)", "response": ["The Recreation Ground, Holbeck held eight first class cricket matches .  Yorkshire CCC played 3 county championship games at the site, including a Roses Match in 1868 and the touring Australians twice played there.   The Roses Match, the first first class game on the ground, was remarkable in that Lancashire were bowled out for just 30 and 34 and lost the match by an innings and 186 runs, one of the most comprehensive defeats in the long history of the fixture .   George Freeman took 12 for 23 in the match while Tom Emmett bagged 8 for 24.  Only two centuries were scored on the ground in first class matches, Irwin Grimshaw scoring an unbeaten 122 in Yorkshire's first innings against Derbyshire CCC in 1886 and Billy Bates making 106 in the second.  The ground has been lost to development and is currently covered by housing."]}]}}
