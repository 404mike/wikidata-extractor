He made his debut the following day against Grimsby Town, when he came on as a first-half substitute for Omar Daley, following defender Matthew Clarke's sending off. City were leading 1\u20130 at the time and won the game 3\u20131. He made his full debut in a 1\u20130 victory over Bury on 29 October. With a number of injuries, Bradford extended his loan spell for a second month, with Huddersfield caretaker manager Gerry Murphy able to recall him at 24 hours' notice. Murphy recalled Clarke on 3 December following a training ground injury to left-back Joe Skarz. Clarke's last game for City was their FA Cup exit to Leyton Orient four days previously; he also played six league games for City. Following the injury sustained by regular right-back Andy Holdsworth, Clarke found himself back in the first-team frame under Lee Clark and scored his first away goal for Huddersfield in a 2\u20131 win at Glanford Park against Scunthorpe United on 10 April 2009."]}, {"page": "Jon Worthington", "response": ["Born in nearby Dewsbury, Worthington began playing for Huddersfield Town at the age of nine, eventually moving through the club's youth academy and into the first team. He primarily plays as a hard tackling central midfielder. Many Terriers fans regarded Worthington as being the main lynchpin of the Town midfield. Other midfielders have attempted to fill that role such as Michael Collins, Andy Holdsworth, Adnan Ahmed, Mark Hudson and loan signing Ronnie Wallwork, but fans felt that the Town midfield four was incomplete without Worthington in the middle."]}, {"page": "Michael Collins (footballer, born 1986)", "response": ["He scored his first league goal of 2007\u201308 in Huddersfield's 2\u20130 win over Yeovil Town at Huish Park on 2 February 2008. During 2007\u201308, Huddersfield manager Andy Ritchie tended to use Collins as cover in right-back and right-midfield positions, but he mainly tended to use Collins in tandem with Andy Holdsworth in Huddersfield's central midfield. On 16 February 2008, Collins equalised Frank Lampard's goal on the stroke of half-time in the FA Cup fifth round at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea.
