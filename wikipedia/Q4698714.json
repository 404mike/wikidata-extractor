Airi L's version got to 22 in the UK Singles Chart.The release of this track prompted the rush release of the original version of the track. EMI Music called Airi L's version \"inferior\" and decided to combat her cover by releasing Guetta's version on 11 June 2009, earlier than originally planned. The cover debuted and peaked at number twenty-two, selling 12,000 copies whilst Guetta and Rowland's version debuted at number seven with 25,000 copies. According to Yahoo! Music's James Masterton, Rowland's version would have debuted at a higher place had it not been for the \"bootleg cover\".
