He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Maryhill at the 1945 general election, and held the seat until his retirement at the February 1974 general election.  He was a Lord of the Treasury from 1946 to 1951, and parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to George Brown at both the Department of Economic Affairs and the Foreign Office from 1964 to 1968.Hannan, a committed pro-European, was one of 69 Labour MPs to break a three-line whip and vote for Britain's entry into the European Economic Community in October 1971. He was, however, opposed to Scottish devolution, and was involved with the 'Scotland is British' campaign prior to the 1979 referendum on Home Rule. Always on the right wing of the Labour Party, in 1981 he became a founder member of the breakaway Social Democratic Party (SDP), and in February of that year was one of 100 signatories to an advertisement in The Guardian supporting the Limehouse Declaration.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Hannan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Hannan"]}, {"page": "Hannan (surname)", "response": ["* William Hannan (1906\u20141987), Labour Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Hannan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Hannan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Hannan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Hannan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Hannan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Hannan"]}, {"page": "Attlee ministry", "response": ["|William Hannan||10 May 1946 \u2013 26 October 1951||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**William Hannan", "**William Hannan", "**William Hannan", "**William Hannan", "**William Hannan", "**William Hannan", "**William Hannan", "**William Hannan"]}, {"page": "Hannan, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Hannan"]}, {"page": "List of MPs for constituencies in Scotland (1970\u2013February 1974)", "response": ["|William Hannan"]}]}}
