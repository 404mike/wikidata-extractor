She becomes Rita Fairclough when she and Len marry in April 1977. The marriage runs into trouble in early 1980, when sick of being taken for granted and living in what she describes as squalor, Rita leaves Len and thanks to Ralph Lancaster's help, attempts to regain her cabaret career. After a physical altercation with Len, she flees to Blackpool, where Len tracks her down after several months and she agrees to return to Coronation Street, but only if Len renovates their home and changes his ways. In the summer of 1981, Rita and Len are rejected for being adoptive parents due to their age, (Rita told the agency she is aged 40, despite actress Knox being 48 at the time), but begin fostering children, enjoying their first foster son, John, despite the challenges. In March 1982, they take in foster daughter Sharon Gaskell (Tracie Bennett), who becomes part of their family. After Len builds a new home on the vacant lot of No. 7, the Faircloughs and Sharon move into the new home, but Sharon eventually moves away.

Sharon returns to comfort Rita, but when she attempts to break up Gail & Brian Tilsley's marriage, Rita throws Sharon out and she is not seen again until 1999. In January 1986, Rita takes in another foster daughter, Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), and meets her estranged father Alan (Mark Eden).

When Rita discovers his infidelity, she insists he choose and although Alan chooses Gloria, Gloria doesn't feel the same and ends their affair. Rita allows Alan to move in to her home and he proposes marriage several times, even going as far as to arrange their wedding as a surprise to Rita, but she refuses to participate when she arrives at the registry office thinking she's a guest at another wedding. Alan is also a conman and after using Rita's capital to fund his own business enterprises, he poses as Len to the bank and re-mortgages Rita's house to start a security business when she refuses any more cash. He hires Dawn Prescott (Louise Harrison) as a receptionist and tries to rape her. Rita learns about the attack and Alan's fraudulent activities and reports him to the building society. In March 1989, in retaliation, he tries to suffocate her but fails and is found not guilty of attempted murder. He starts stalking Rita, who has a breakdown and escapes to Blackpool, but in December 1989 Alan tracks her down and tries to make her return to Weatherfield, but he is run down by a tram and killed in the attempt."]}]}}
