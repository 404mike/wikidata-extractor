In the thirteenth minute, Klug had a corner cleared off the goal-line and Dean Barker's follow up shot was blocked. Marlin Devaney equalised for Tamworth after half-time. Martin Myers on the right-hand side for Tamworth was effective and led Sudbury to make a double substitution. The game went to extra-time and when the whistle was blown after the first 15 minutes of extra-time, Mike Henry threw a punch at Russell Gordon and, although the referee did not see it, the linesman ran on to the pitch and Henry was sent off. Sudbury's man of the match, according to the East Anglian Daily Times, was Hubbick. The players climbed the steps of Wembley to be presented to chief guest Pat Jennings.", "|FW ||9 || Dave Hubbick", "|FW ||9 || Dave Hubbick"]}, {"page": "Hubbick", "response": ["*Dave Hubbick (born 1960), English footballer"]}]}}
