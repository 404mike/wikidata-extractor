He settled in the country at the age of 19, eventually building himself a fine villa in Tangier where he lived for much of his life. His linguistic skills and physical appearance enabled him to pose successfully as a native Moroccan, travelling to parts of the country regarded as off-limits to foreigners. He wrote a number of well-regarded books and articles on his travels in Morocco and other countries in the Near and Far East. Harris also played a significant, though not always constructive, role in the European diplomatic intrigues that affected Morocco around the turn of the 20th century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "French protectorate in Morocco", "response": ["Walter Burton Harris, a British journalist who wrote extensively on Morocco, commented upon French preservation of traditional Moroccan society:"]}, {"page": "Abdelaziz of Morocco", "response": ["Ahmed er-Raisuni, a warlord with Alawite ancestry, started a gang near Tangier that would kidnap Christians, including Ion Perdicaris, Walter Burton Harris, and Harry Aubrey de Vere Maclean, and ransom them\u2014in open defiance of the Makhzen of Abd al-Aziz."]}, {"page": "Abd al-Hafid of Morocco", "response": ["In 1910, Lalla Batoul, a Fesi aristocrat and the wife of a former governor of Fes and supporter of Abdelaziz, was tortured.

By the early 20th century, Morocco was divided into protectorates ruled by France and Spain. The Rif region had been assigned to Spain, but given that the Sultans of Morocco had been unable to exert control over the region, Spanish sovereignty over the Rif was strictly de jure with little practical control. For centuries, the Berber tribes of the Rif had fought off any attempt of outsiders to impose control on them.Perry, James Arrogant Armies, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 273. While the Rif mountains were visible to Europeans from ships in the Mediterranean Sea, Europeans had rarely if ever ventured into the area. Walter Burton Harris, the Morocco correspondent for The Times, who covered the war, wrote that as late as 1912 only \"one or two Europeans had been able to visit the cedar forests that lie south of Fez. A few had traveled in the southern Atlas and pushed on into the Sus...and that was almost all\". As Harris wrote, the Berbers \"were often as inhospitable to the Arab as they were to the foreigner\", and generally killed any outsiders who ventured into their territory."]}, {"page": "Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni", "response": ["Raisuni's first victim was Walter Burton Harris, an Englishman and correspondent for The Times who already knew Raisuni.
