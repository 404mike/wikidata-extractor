With his partner Daphne Wallis, he was the British Ice Dance champion for many years, in the era before international competitions in this discipline were recognized by the International Skating Union.

In 1933, the Westminster Skating Club conducted a competition encouraging the creation of new dances.Hines (2006), pp. 123\u2013124 Beginning in the mid-1930s, national organizations began to introduce skating proficiency tests in set-pattern dances, improve the judging of dance tests, and oversee competitions. The first national competitions occurred in England in 1934, Canada in 1935, the U.S. in 1936, and Austria in 1937. These competitions included one or more compulsory dances, the original dance, and the free dance.Hines (2011), p. 102 By the late 1930s, ice dancers swelled memberships in skating clubs throughout the world, and in Hines' words \"became the backbone of skating clubs\"."]}, {"page": "World Figure Skating Hall of Fame", "response": ["|  Reginald Wilkie"]}, {"page": "Wilkie (surname)", "response": ["*Reginald Wilkie (1907\u20131962), British ice dancer"]}]}}
