In 1796 Bishopwearmouth in turn gained a physical link with Monkwearmouth following the construction of a bridge, the Wearmouth Bridge, which was the world's second iron bridge (after the famous span at Ironbridge). It was built at the instigation of Rowland Burdon, the Member of Parliament (MP) for County Durham, and described by Nikolaus Pevsner as being 'a triumph of the new metallurgy and engineering ingenuity [...] of superb elegance'. Spanning the river in a single sweep of , it was over twice the length of the earlier bridge at Ironbridge but only three-quarters the weight. At the time of building, it was the biggest single-span bridge in the world; and because Sunderland had developed on a plateau above the river, it never suffered from the problem of interrupting the passage of high-masted vessels."]}, {"page": "John Soane", "response": ["It was then that Soane met Maria Hadfield (they became lifelong friends) and Thomas Banks. Soane was now fairly fluent in the Italian language, a sign of his growing confidence.Darley, 1999, p. 41 A party, including Thomas Bowdler, Rowland Burdon, John Patteson, John Stuart and Henry Grewold Lewis, decided to visit Sicily and paid for Soane to accompany them as a draughtsman.Darley, 1999, p. 43 The party headed for Naples on 11 April, where on 21 April they caught a Swedish ship to Palermo. Soane visited the Villa Palagonia, which made a deep impact on him.Darley, 1999, pp. 44\u201345 Influenced by the account of the Villa in his copy of Patrick Brydone's Tour through Sicily and Malta, Soane savoured the \"Prince of Palagonia's Monsters\u00a0... nothing more than the most extravagant caricatures in stone\", but more significantly seems to have been inspired by the Hall of Mirrors to introduce similar effects when he came to design the interiors of his own house in Lincoln's Inn Fields.Edward Chaney, The Evolution of the Grand Tour (London, 2000), pp. 32\u201336 Leaving Palermo from where the party split, Stuart and Bowdler going off together. The rest headed for Segesta, Trapani, Selinunte and Agrigento, exposing Soane to Ancient Greek architecture.Darley, 1999, p. 45 From Agrigento the party headed for Licata, where they sailed for Malta and Valletta returning on 2 June, to Syracuse, Sicily. Moving on to Catania and Palazzo Biscari then Mount Etna, Taormina, Messina and the Lepari Islands.Darley, 1999, pp. 47\u201348 They were back in Naples by 2 July where Soane purchased books and prints, visiting Sorrento before returning to Rome.Darley, 1999, p. 48 Shortly after, John Patterson returned to England via Vienna, from where he sent Soane the first six volumes of The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, delivered by Antonio Salieri.Darley, 1999, p. 49", "In Rome Soane's circle now included Henry Tresham, Thomas Jones (artist) and Nathaniel Marchant. Soane continued to study the buildings of Rome, including the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Soane and Rowland Burdon set out in August for Lombardy. Their journey included visits to Ancona, Rimini, Bologna, Parma and its Accademia, Milan, Verona, Vicenza and its buildings by Andrea Palladio, Padua, the Brenta (river) with its villas by Palladio, Venice. Then back to Bologna where Soane copied designs for completing the west front of San Petronio Basilica including ones by Palladio, Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Baldassare Peruzzi. Then to Florence and the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno of which he was later, in January 1780 elected a member; then returned to Rome.Darley, 1999, p. 50", "Soane counted many members of the Royal Academy as friends, including J. M. W. Turner, with whom he spent the Christmas after his wife's death; Soane also owned three works by the artist. John Flaxman, professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy, was an old friend and Soane also acquired several plaster-casts of Flaxman's work for his museum.  Soane also counted Thomas Banks as a friend (and owned sculptures by him), and Thomas Lawrence, who painted Soane's portrait. Despite the professional falling-out with his old master, George Dance the Younger, they remained firm friends. After Dance's death Soane purchased his drawings. After the death of his other teacher, Henry Holland, Soane tried to buy his drawings and papers, but found they had been destroyed; he did however purchase some of his antique sculptures.Stroud, 1966, p. 152 Despite being professional rivals, Soane got on with fellow architect John Nash; they often dined together.Darley, 1999, p. 292 Soane called on William Thomas Beckford both in London and when he was taking the waters in Bath in 1829. Soane had other friends including James Perry, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, Barbara HoflandWaterfield, p. 45 and Rowland Burdon, whose friendship was formed while on the Grand Tour."]}, {"page": "Burdon (surname)", "response": ["* Rowland Burdon (died 1838) (1757\u20131838), English landowner and politician", "* Rowland Burdon (Sedgefield MP) (1857\u20131944), English landowner and politician"]}, {"page": "County Durham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Rowland Burdon"]}, {"page": "Rowland Burdon (Sedgefield MP)", "response": ["Colonel Rowland Burdon, VD, DL, JP (19 June 1857 \u2013 1 August 1944) was an English landowner and Conservative Party politician from County Durham.
