Since 2004 he has been professor of particle physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester.He is the co-author of five books, including the popular science books Why Does E=mc\u00b2?, The Quantum Universe and Universal: A guide to the cosmos, co-written with physicist Brian Cox. He has also written over 100 peer reviewed papers published in scientific journals and speaks at international science festivals for children and adults. He frequently acts as science consultant to the BBC and other media and is a columnist for The Observer.\nForshaw is a recipient of the Maxwell Medal and Prize for his contribution to particle physics, and the Kelvin Prize from the Institute of Physics for his contribution to the public understanding of physics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of physicists", "response": ["*Jeff Forshaw \u2013 U.K. (born 1968) "]}, {"page": "1968", "response": ["**Jeff Forshaw, British particle physicist"]}, {"page": "List of theoretical physicists", "response": ["* Jeff Forshaw (born 1968)"]}, {"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["*Why Does E=mc2?, Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw"]}, {"page": "Introduction to quantum mechanics", "response": ["* Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw (2011) The Quantum Universe.
