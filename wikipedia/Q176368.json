Spencer Gore, the founder of the Camden Town Group of artists, painted the route in 1912 while staying with his friend Harold Gilman at Letchworth. His work, influenced by C\u00e9zanne, Van Gogh and Gauguin, is acknowledged as one of the pioneering works of British Modernism.Google Arts & Culture - The Icknield Way. From the collection of Art Gallery of New South Wales.Smith, Bernard (2002). A Pavane for Another Time. . Macmillan Education AU. p.449 One of the best known literary travellers of the Icknield Way is the poet Edward Thomas, who walked the path in 1911 and published his account in 1913. Thomas was interested in ancient roads and inspired by Hilaire Belloc's Old Road and other travel memoirs published by Constable written by R. Hippisley Cox, Harold J.E. Peake and others. Although the book takes the form of a single 10-day journey, Thomas wrote the book in stages over the course of a year. He was often joined by his brother Julian, both rising at 5 am or 6 am to walk  a day. Although more interested in poetic description, his publisher directed him to give more concrete details of his route, thus the book is closer to being a guidebook than Thomas' earlier, more poetic, travel books.Moorcroft Wilson, Jean (2015). Edward Thomas: from Adlestrop to Arras: A Biography Bloomsbury. . p.227-229. Inspired by Thomas's journey, contemporary British nature writer, Robert MacFarlane, begins his book of walking ancient paths, The Old Ways, by walking the Icknield Way, \"hoping to summon him [Thomas] by walking where he had walked\".MacFarlane, Robert (2012).
