He was then revealed as club captain on 8 August ahead of their season opening game with Doncaster Rovers. With the club struggling for league form, an FA Cup run to the third round produced a dream tie for Edwards as Yeovil were drawn against Manchester United at Huish Park.

The squad was joined by five players who were signed during the off season, former Bristol City and Scotland international full-back Jamie McAllister, released Oldham Athletic duo Keanu Marsh-Brown and Reuben Reid, former Doncaster Rovers forward James Hayter and attacking midfielder Sam Foley after he rejected a new contract with Conference side Newport County. Midfielder Michael Woods was invited back for pre-season training after a non-contract spell at the end of last season, but did not return and Oxford City full-back James Clarke was also invited for a pre-season trial. The first day of pre-season saw the signing of versatile left sided player Nathan Ralph following his release from Peterborough United and former Northampton Town winger Lewis Young. These two new players were supplemented by trialists including Clarke, Canadian goalkeeper Lucas Birnstingl, former Kilmarnock midfielder Ross Lindsay and former Southampton trainee Aarran Racine. On 4 July 2012, despite being half way through his two-year contract defender Bondz N'Gala left the club for fellow League One side Stevenage. Central defender Byron Webster, who had been released by Northampton Town earlier in the day, was signed on a two-year contract and the following day the club sign former loan goalkeeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch on a two-year contract. On 13 July 2012, Chelsea youngster Rohan Ince signed on a six-month loan deal.", "Yeovil's dismal run of form continued into October, and despite a Reuben Reid penalty the club suffered a 2\u20131 home defeat against Portsmouth, their sixth consecutive defeat as the club slid to 16th in the League One table. The game proved more costly for Yeovil than merely a defeat with injuries to both Lewis Young, ankle ligament damage and Gozie Ugwu, recurrence of a hamstring injury, ruling them both out for the month of October, in an attempt to arrest this run of form and as cover for those injuries, on 4 October, Gary Johnson completed the loan signing of Republic of Ireland U21 striker Paddy Madden from Carlisle United. The move worked with immediate effect with Madden scoring a brace on his debut and Hayter adding a third in a 3\u20131 victory over Colchester United. The poor run of form though was reflected by the Colchester United match being the club's lowest ever Football League attendance of just 3,002. This improved performance led to a double nomination in the Football League's Team of the Week with Irish duo Madden and winger Sam Foley both represented. On 9 October, Yeovil's away Football League Trophy tie against Torquay United was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Plainmoor, with the match rescheduled for the following week on the following Saturday the winner of the tie was given the reward of a home Area Quarter-final tie against Wycombe Wanderers in the next round. Another encouraging performance away at league leaders Tranmere Rovers saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead after half an hour thanks to goals from Madden and Foley, but another second half collapse saw Tranmere comeback to win the game 3\u20132 with Yeovil's plight not aided by having Joe Edwards sent off for two yellow cards. In their rearranged tie on 16 October, Yeovil salvaged a 2\u20132 draw against Torquay United with a stoppage time equaliser from James Hayter, to add to his earlier goal, with Yeovil winning the tie 5\u20134 on penalties, having scored all five of their spot kicks and keeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch having saved Torquay's Thomas Cruise's effort. The victory confirming Yeovil's progress to the Area Quarter-final stage of the Football League Trophy, for the first time in five years, with a home tie against Wycombe Wanderers. An unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over a ten-man Bury followed courtesy of goals from Byron Webster and Foley, the performance of midfielder Korey Smith earned him recognition in the League One Team of the Week. That weekend in the draw for the FA Cup First Round Proper Yeovil were given an away tie against fellow League One side Preston North End, to be played on 3 November. On 23 October, with injuries continuing to hamper the squad young Jamaican-born midfielder Daniel Johnson joined the club on a month-long youth loan deal from Aston Villa. That evening Yeovil strolled to a 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden and a goal from top scorer Hayter who took his tally for the season to seven, Daniel Johnson made his debut as a second-half substitute but had the ignominy of giving away a penalty. Yeovil ended the month with a third consecutive victory this time a 1\u20130 away win against Crewe Alexandra thanks to a second goal in a week for defender Byron Webster, the result was also only Yeovil's second clean sheet in the League that season. After a two-month loan spell at AFC Wimbledon, defender Curtis Haynes-Brown returned to the club having made six appearances for the Dons. Webster's winning goal and the club's second league clean sheet of the season led to his inclusion in the Football League's Team of the Week.", "Yeovil began the month with a home Football League Trophy tie against Football League Two side Wycombe Wanderers, courtesy of first-half goals from midfielders Ed Upson and Sam Foley Yeovil recorded a comfortable 2\u20130 victory. The victory meant that Yeovil had qualified for the Southern Area Semi-finals the furthest they had ever reached in the competition, in the draw for this match on 8 December Yeovil were drawn away against League One rivals Leyton Orient. The same day Yeovil faced Notts County at home and despite multiple chances and saves forced from visiting keeper Bartosz Bia\u0142kowski were forced to be content with a 0\u20130 draw. Manager Gary Johnson announced after the match that Watford defender Dale Bennett had returned to his parent club a month early after just one substitute appearance due to a back injury. On 15 December, Yeovil faced an away game against Walsall and recovered from 2\u20130 down to draw thanks to a goal from substitute Reuben Reid and a last minute equaliser from Sam Foley. For the Football League Trophy tie with Leyton Orient in January the club offer fans free transport to the match in an attempt to get 500 away travelling supporters, with these coaches funded by the chairman John Fry, joint owner Norman Hayward, directors, vice-presidents, manager Gary Johnson and the playing squad. On 22 December, despite conceding the opening goal in only the third minute against Oldham Athletic the team turned the game around thanks to two goals from Gavin Williams, the second a superb 30-yard strike, and two late goals from Hayter and Madden seeing Yeovil to a 4\u20131 victory their largest home victory of the season. Yeovil's Boxing Day fixture saw them face a short trip to Bournemouth without Foley with a hamstring injury and Korey Smith and Joe Edwards both of whom had returned to their parent clubs due to their loan spells having been completed, a stretched squad suffered a 3\u20130 reverse. Following the game Johnson confirmed that the January transfer window would see an overhaul of the squad with the hope of helping Yeovil move up the table in the second half of the season, Johnson confirmed two of these signing would be likely to be the permanent acquisition of Paddy Madden and the signing of Irish trialist Kevin Dawson. On 29 December, Yeovil visited Fratton Park for the first time in their history to take on Portsmouth the Glovers won the game 2\u20131 thanks to two first half goals from set-pieces ending the calendar year in 12th place in the League One table with 36 points from 25 matches played. Present at the game were two trialists captain of Middlesbrough under\u201321 side's Matthew Dolan and former Chelsea trainee Aliu Djal\u00f3 with a view to them signing on loan and permanently respectively in the January transfer window. Defender Byron Webster received recognition for his goal and impressive performance in the League One Team of the Week.", "Yeovil began the month with a home fixture against fellow play-off chasers Brentford, Yeovil won the game 3\u20130 courtesy of a fourteenth goal of the season for Paddy Madden, superb 25-yard second from Ed Upson on his 100th appearance for the club and a volley from centre back Dan Burn. Both Upson and Burn's performances were recognised with places in the League One Team of the Week. On 5 February, Yeovil were due to play their rearranged fixture against Oldham Athletic but the game was postponed for a second time this time due because of snow. The following Saturday, Yeovil visited Coventry City searching for their sixth consecutive league victory and this was achieved thanks to a goal in first half injury time from in-form Irish striker Paddy Madden. This sound defensive display led to Dan Burn being included in the Team of the Week for the second consecutive week. On 12 February, Yeovil matched their club record for consecutive wins in the Football League with their seventh consecutive victory after coming from behind against Preston North End. The Glovers were trailing to Chris Beardsley's goal at half time, but scored three second-half goals without reply from Hayter, Nathan Ralph and top scorer Paddy Madden with his ninth goal in just six appearances. Yeovil extended their winning run to eight league games with a 3\u20130 victory over Scunthorpe United, courtesy of goals from Byron Webster, James Hayter and Paddy Madden as Yeovil move up to third place in the League One table. Both Webster and Madden's performances were recognised with places in the League One Team of the Week. The club's record Football League winning run was ended with a 1\u20131 draw away at Doncaster Rovers, despite an early Madden goal. With Paddy Madden scoring in his eighth consecutive league game he broke a 50-year-old club record previously held by Dennis Coughlin, but the club's nine game unbeaten run came to an abrupt end with a 2\u20130 defeat against relegation threatened Colchester United. On 28 February, Burnley striker Wes Fletcher joined the club on a one-month loan deal to provide attacking cover at the club. The club finished the month in sixth place in the league table, and a record of four wins, one draw and one defeat was enough for Gary Johnson to be nominated for Manager of the Month but was beaten by Hartlepool United's John Hughes, and Paddy Madden's five goals in six games was enough for a nomination for the Player of the Month award but lost out to fellow Hartlepool player Peter Hartley.", "Yeovil began the month with a crucial home fixture against fellow play-off chasers Tranmere Rovers, Yeovil won the game 1\u20130 thanks to a well-executed free-kick from Ed Upson overtaking Tranmere in the process up to fifth place in the League One table. Ed Upson's fifth goal of the season was enough to see him included in the League One Team of the Week for the second time this season. Following the game it was reported that The Football Association were investigated an incident at the end of the match between Yeovil captain Jamie McAllister and Tranmere winger and former Yeovil player Abdulai Bell-Baggie, with the papers claiming that Bell-Baggie had been racially abused by McAllister. Manager Gary Johnson told the BBC that captain Jamie McAllister was \"upset\" to be the subject of an inquiry by the Football Association, and would deny any allegations against him. On 9 March, Yeovil played out a goalless draw away at relegation threatened Hartlepool United. On 11 March, Yeovil signed ex-Chelsea full-back and left sided player Ben Gordon on one-month contract as cover for captain Jamie McAllister. Gordon made his full debut the following day replacing the injured Sam Foley, despite taking a two-goal lead after just 18 minutes thanks to goals from Byron Webster and top goalscorer Paddy Madden, a second half turnaround from Crawley Town rescued them a 2\u20132 draw and ended Yeovil's seven game home winning run.

On 26 March, Queens Park Rangers left winger and striker \u00c1ngelo Balanta joined the club on loan until the end of the season to provide attacking cover at the club. Kevin Dawson's performance in the Carlisle game was enough to earn him a second nomination of the season to the Football League Team of the Week. On 27 March, Matthew Dolan unexpectedly returned to the club on loan from Middlesbrough until the end of the season, and the following day it was confirmed Reuben Reid would remain at Plymouth Argyle on loan until the end of the season as well. Yeovil played fellow play-off chasers Walsall at home on Good Friday, but both sides lacked attacking quality as a game of few chances ended goalless. The result meant Yeovil had won just one of their last eight games but still remained seventh just a point outside the play-off positions.", "The first-leg of the play-offs saw Yeovil face Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, on 3 May. Yeovil's defence was strengthened by the return of captain Jamie McAllister and centre backs Byron Webster and Dan Burn from injury, after a cagey first half Sheffield United took the lead just 52 seconds into the second half through teenager Callum McFadzean and held the lead until the final whistle. The return leg at Huish Park was played on 6 May, in front of the club's largest crowd in five years an attendance of 8,152. An early Kevin Dawson goal levelled the tie on aggregate before a late header from Ed Upson sent Yeovil to Wembley, the 2\u20130 home victory giving Yeovil a 2\u20131 aggregate victory.", "|Byron Webster|| v Portsmouth, 2 October||5 cautions||1 match||Colchester United (H), League One"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 5 July 2012 || CB ||  || Byron Webster || Yeovil Town || Released ||"]}, {"page": "List of York City F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["As of the date above, 12 players have left the club with 24 career appearances; Bobby Warrender, Fred Marlow, Brad Halliday, Bradley Fewster, Tom Mitchell, John Hammerton, Liam George, Jamie Price, Nick Pope, Richard Tindale, Phil Taylor and Byron Webster.

However Knight-Percival failed to build a good understanding with Byron Webster and featured just twice after Chris Beech replaced Pressley as \"Blues\" boss in November.

It had already been known that Sheffield Wednesday will have to let players go out before anyone comes in due to the tight wage budget and finances at the club. Martin Taylor was the first player to go out on loan as he joined Brentford for a month. Back at Hillsborough Stadium after the international break and Sheffield Wednesday faced newly promoted Yeovil Town, with the Owls looking to gain their first win of the season. Both teams started fairly evenly and it was Yeovil who had the first key chance when they forced Kamil Zayatte into making a goal line clearance. However, as the Owls continued to push, a long ball over the top, saw the linesman put the offside flag up for Atdhe Nuhiu who seemed to be going for the ball, however the referee didn't blow his whistle as Michail Antonio picked up the ball instead as he was in an on side position, therefore the referee had over-ruled the linesman with the game continuing to go on. Yeovil momentarily paused waiting for the whistle, while Michail Antonio went through on goal and passed the ball square to Atdhe Nuhiu who passed the ball into the net. A controversial goal followed many Yeovil complaints, with the referee discussing the matter with the linesman and eventually decided to give the goal. Replays after the game showed that the referee had made the correct decision. As Yeovil felt hard done by the contest fell into a scrappy, rough affair with strong challenges going in, mainly from the Yeovil Town players. And on 41-minutes, just after Nuhiu had a header just miss the back of the net, Yeovil defender Byron Webster was caught in a rough tangle with Nuhiu which led to both players falling to the ground and Byron Webster seeming to throw a punch at Nuhiu while tussling on the ground. Byron Webster saw a straight red card for the incident and the Owls couldn't have gone in much better at half-time. Into the second half and although it was the Owls in the lead and having the extra man advantage, it was Yeovil who were the better side and somehow pushing for the equaliser. Yeovil Town's Joe Ralls gave his team what they deserved with 25-minutes to go when he took a great first-touch outside the area and finished nicely on the volley into the far corner. After this both sides gave it their all and Sheffield Wednesday now looked the more likely team to score and the fans thought they was about to do just that as a cross found Antonio who volleyed towards the goal where the opposition goalkeeper saved the shot, but also fumbled it, and as the ball rolled and hit the inside of the post, Nuhiu and R\u00e9da Johnson raced to tap the ball home but the keeper pounced upon the loose ball just in the time. Sheffield Wednesday were left with another draw, this one though more disappointing than the others due to the position they were in at half-time and arguably should have gone on to win the game."]}, {"page": "2013 Football League One play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||5||Byron Webster"]}]}}
