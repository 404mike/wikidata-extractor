He is a Tutorial Fellow of St John\u2019s College, Oxford and has a large research group based at the Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory at Oxford University. Compton has broad interests in both fundamental and applied electrochemistry and electro-analysis including nano-chemical aspects. He has published more than 1600 papers (h-index = 102) with more than 44,000 citations, excluding self-cites, as of March 2020; Reuters-Thomson \u2018Highly Cited Researcher\u2019 2014, 2015 and 2016) and 7 books (see list below).\nPatents have been filed on 25 different topics including novel pH sensors, gas sensing and the detection of garlic strength and chilli heat in foodstuffs. The Senova pHit Scanner based on Compton group patents - the world\u2019s first calibration-free pH meter - won the 'best new product' award at PITTCON March 2013.Richard Compton has been CAS Visiting Professor at the Institute of Physical Sciences, Hefei and is a Lifelong Honorary Professor at Sichuan University. He holds Honorary Doctorates from the Estonian Agricultural University and Kharkov National University of Radio-electronics (Ukraine) and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, of IUPAC and of the International Society of Electrochemistry. He received the Royal Society of Chemistry's Sir George Stokes Award in 2011, and their Robert Boyle Prize for Analytical Science in 2018.He is a Member of the Academia Europaea and Founding Editor and Editor-in-Chief of the journal Electrochemistry Communications, published by Elsevier.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scunthorpe", "response": ["* Richard G.
