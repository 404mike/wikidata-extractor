Within two months of his arrival he had just three players left and had to rebuild the team from scratch. Unsurprisingly, the Albion finished in the bottom four of their division in his first season in charge. His desperate search led to FA charges. On 2 April 1906 he was suspended from football management for 4 months."]}, {"page": "Frank McAvoy", "response": ["In December 1901 McAvoy had a confrontation with Brighton & Hove Albion's manager, John Jackson which didn't calm down. This culminated in McAvoy assaulting Jackson and knocking him to the ground the following February. McAvoy was sacked from the club as a result. In August, McAvoy, along with fellow former player, Clem Barker, went to the Farm Tavern (which Jackson ran) looking for him. He was away and the pair told his wife; \"We are going to the station to meet your husband, and you must consider yourself lucky if he is brought home alive!\". They were found guilty of threatening behaviour and bound to keep the peace for 6 months. Paul Camillin & Stewart Weir. \"Albion: The First 100 Years\". Brighton. Sports Pavilion. 2001"]}]}}
