Francis became the 5th Baronet of Hutton on the death of his first cousin, Sir Henry Ralph Fletcher-Vane, 4th Baronet.Sir Francis was an early aide of Robert Baden-Powell (they both attended Charterhouse School) and was the Scout Commissioner of London before Baden-Powell ousted him from his Baden-Powell Boy Scouts organisation. Fletcher-Vane later founded the Order of World Scouts, the earliest multinational scouting organisation, and is counted one of the founders of scouting in Italy.\nAs a military officer, he helped expose the murder of several innocent civilians by an officer under his command during the 1916 Easter Rising. In 2016, on the anniversary of the Easter Rising, Sir Francis was commemorated on a postage stamp in Ireland for the strength of character he showed during those troubles.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir Frederick Fletcher-Vane, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["Letters written by Walter to his parents passed to Walter's nephew, Francis:The Other Illusions, by Captain Sir Francis Vane Bt.
