This production took the realistic approach and did not shirk from the more specific aspects of the violence; for example, Lavinia has trouble walking after the rape, which, it is implied, was anal rape. Nunn believed the play asked profound questions about the sustainability of Elizabethan society, and as such, he linked the play to the contemporary period to ask the same questions of late twentieth-century England; he was \"less concerned with the condition of ancient Rome than with the morality of contemporary life.\"Massai (2001: lxxx) In his program notes, Nunn famously wrote \"Shakespeare's Elizabethan nightmare has become ours.\" He was especially interested in the theory that decadence had led to the collapse of Rome.

In The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised Jackson's performance: \"This version of Hedda Gabler is all Miss Jackson's Hedda and, I must say, great fun to watch ... Miss Jackson's technical virtuosity is particularly suited to a character like Hedda. Her command of her voice and her body, as well as the Jackson mannerisms, have the effect of separating the actress from the character in a very curious way.\" In 1978, she scored box office success in the United States in the romantic comedy House Calls, which co-starred Walter Matthau.

After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zo\u00eb Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member of the company and found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors.Hordern, p. 144. Writing in his 1993 autobiography, Hordern wrote: \"Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission you serve is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land.\"Hordern, p. 145. Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose,\"The Slipper and the Rose\", British Film Institute, accessed 18 February 2016. and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre.\"Jumpers\", The Spectator, 1 October 1976, p. 28. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren \"enjoyed it immoderately\" and thought the revival revealed a \"tidier play than it look[ed]\". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: \"It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent.\""]}, {"page": "Terence Rattigan", "response": ["Thea Sharrock directed his rarely seen After the Dance in the summer of 2010 at London's Royal National Theatre.

In December 1973 Buzz Goodbody, the company's first female director,Colin Chambers Inside the Royal Shakespeare Company: Creativity and the Institution, Abingdon: Routledge, 2004, p. 67 drew up a plan for what would become The Other Place studio theatre in Stratford, designed by Michael Reardon to seat 140 people, which opened to a first and highly successful season in 1974. The name chosen for the new studio space was favoured within the company because it implied an alternative theatre, but also because it is a quotation from Hamlet.", "Summing up this triumphant period, The Guardian critic Michael Billington later wrote: \"[In 1977] the RSC struck gold. This was, in fact, the perihelion of Trevor Nunn's ten-year reign as the company's sole Artistic Director and Chief Executive (in 1978 he began to share power with Terry Hands). In London, the company opened a new studio space at the Donmar Warehouse with plays by Barker, Taylor, Bond and Brecht. Its Aldwych repertory combined the usual Stratford transfers with Nichol's Privates on Parade, Ibsen's Pillars of the Community and Brecht's The Days of the Commune. At the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Terry Hands and actor Alan Howard had a marathon year working on Henry V, a virtually uncut, Henry VI, part 1, Henry VI, part 2 and Henry VI, part 3 and Coriolanus.
