His primary position was wing-half, but over the course of his career he played in many different positions. He later managed Port Vale on two separate occasions, serving throughout World War I, before a three-year spell from 1932 to 1935. He also served the club for many years as a trainer and a scout. In 1924 he turned out for the Vale at the age of 46 years and 68 days, making him one of the oldest ever players in the English Football League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["The club's highest attendance at Vale Park is 49,768 against Aston Villa in the FA Cup on 20 February 1960, whilst the lowest is 554 against Middlesbrough U21 in the EFL Trophy on 16 October 2018. The highest transfer fee received for a Vale player is \u00a32,000,000 from Wimbledon for Gareth Ainsworth on 29 October 1998, while Ainsworth was also the most expensive player bought, costing \u00a3500,000 from Lincoln City on 11 September 1997.

Now partnered by Tom Holford and George Baddeley this new half-back line helped keep Stoke in the First Division for five more years. The press described Bradley as 'a model of consistency' but he was also a skilful player who became one of the first to use tricks. He would swing hard at the ball with his right foot and dummy the player facing him by kicking the ball with the outside of his left. Despite the quality of their midfield, year after year Stoke narrowly clung on to their top-flight status. Improvements to the Victoria Ground in 1903 cost \u00a32,000 swallowing the club's already dwindling finances and so the board agreed to sell their best players with Bradley poised to join Plymouth Argyle in 1905. But he refused to join the Southern side was instead sold to Liverpool for \u00a3420."]}, {"page": "1902\u201303 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Tom Holford"]}, {"page": "George Baddeley", "response": ["Born in Fegg Hayes, Stoke-upon-Trent, Baddeley attended Fegg Hayes Church of England School.

He was awarded the captaincy in his first full season of 1902\u201303, alongside Tom Holford and James Bradley, Baddeley completed a powerful midfield three which effectively kept Stoke in the First Division throughout the early 1900s. Although occasionally criticised for 'marring a clever display by trying to do much with the ball' Baddeley's consistency allowed him to play 99 consecutive for Stoke from February 1903. Despite home crowds averaging 8,000 in 1905\u201306, the directors brought poorly and Stoke imploded first being relegated and then being liquidated which saw them leave the Football League at the end of the 1907\u201308 season."]}, {"page": "Joe Schofield", "response": ["Schofield remained in the Potteries after leaving the Victoria Ground, and was appointed as the secretary of Port Vale in March 1920, taking over from Tom Holford. Schofield was a 'man of well-balanced judgement', 'the player's friend, confidant and counsellor' with a knack of discovering and developing promising players. Vale ended the 1919\u201320 season in 13th place in the Second Division.", "He prepared for 1923\u201324 by bringing in Stalybridge Celtic goalkeeper Tommy Lonsdale; Macclesfield Town 'penalty king' right-back Jack Maddock; Leeds United tough-tackling half-back Alf Dark; Bolton Wanderers winger Jack Lowe; Clyde's reliable forward Fred Howard; and Exeter City goal machine Harold Crockford. He later bought Ireland international Louis Bookman for \u00a3250 from Luton Town. Tom Butler died of lockjaw on 11 November, eight days after sustaining a broken arm in a draw at Clapton Orient. Schofield brought winger Arthur Bridgett out of retirement despite the fact that he had not played a league game since 1912. He also played Tom Holford on 5 April 1924 at the age of 46. The club finished the season in 16th place, five points ahead of relegated Nelson."]}]}}
