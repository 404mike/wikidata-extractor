He spent his first two his seasons at Old Georgians, having been part of Surbiton's youth setup, and then returned to Surbiton for 2005/06, scoring 24 goals in his debut season. Centralized training for the England and GB hockey teams limited his club appearances in subsequent seasons but when he was not included in the post-Olympics squad in Autumn 2012, he was given an opportunity to recapture some of his earlier career form. He finished the 2012/13 season as the 2nd top goalscorer in the Men's England Hockey League Premier Division with 18 goals. Work commitments and injuries limited Tindall to 12 league appearances in the 2013/14 season but he still managed 9 goals for a Surbiton team which eventually finished 4th in the league. He also made one appearance in the NOW:Pensions Men's Cup and scored twice.\nTindall returned to Old Georgians in 2014/15, as part of the Weybridge club's aim to return to the Men's England Hockey League from the South League Premier.
