He then joined non-league side Stocksbridge Park Steels in 1994, working his way into the first team after impressive performances in the reserves.In 1999 Marples moved to Doncaster Rovers for \u00a312,000, which remains a club record fee received for a Stocksbridge player. Marples impressed so much in his early weeks at the club that he attracted interest from Premier League clubs, with Rovers valuing him at more than \u00a3200,000.Maples stayed with Rovers and was part of the teams that won the Football Conference playoffs and the Division 3 championship in successive seasons from 2003 to 2004.\nHe signed for Chester in the summer of 2006 on a free transfer and over the next two years would again fail to find the net in more than 50 first\u2013team appearances. In March 2008 he was placed on 'gardening leave' at Chester, believed to be following a dispute over his non-selection in the team. He did not play for the club again and was released at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doncaster Rovers F.C.", "response": ["| 1999\u20132000 ||  Simon Marples ||"]}, {"page": "2003 Football Conference play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||2 ||Simon Marples"]}, {"page": "Marples", "response": ["*Simon Marples (born 1975), English soccer player"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|2||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Simon Marples"]}]}}
