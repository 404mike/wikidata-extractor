Although financially the club were doing well, their finishing places in the league was not as rosy.Adamson, p. 30. Under the guidance of new chairman W.T.

Spurred on by great home attendance figures, Scarborough left the Yorkshire League after just one season to join the stronger Midland Football League. With James McGraham as player-coach, Scarborough played attractive attacking football and managed to surprise most by finishing runners-up to Gainsborough Trinity at their first attempt. Local rivals Scarborough Penguins folded around this time and merged with Boro. Several players were signed by Football League clubs, but with goalscorer Billy Clayson leading the way, Scarborough were crowned champions of the Midland League in 1929\u201330.Adamson, p. 40.", "The financial cost it took to build a squad capable of winning the league backfired, many had to be sold to Football League clubs as a result. Despite the drop in form in the Midlands League, Boro shined in the F.A. Cup reaching the Third Round; one of these fixtures was considered the greatest ever played at the Athletic Ground, where Scarborough came from behind to beat Football League side Lincoln City 6\u20134. A couple of years later, the transfer of club hero Billy Clayson to York City just a season after Scarborough had knocked the fellow Yorkshire club out of the F.A. Cup would light the fire of a rivalry between the two, essentially taking the place of the older rivalry with Whitby.Adamson, p. 43. After coming close to folding and disastrous league form, experienced former Manchester United man Thomas Boyle was brought in as player-manager and helped the club to improve drastically, with a decent F.A. Cup run in the year just after he left, where Boro reached the Third Round before going out to Luton Town after a replay.Adamson, p. 45.

With that in mind, Womack made several impressive signings during the close season, among them Arsenal centre half Jack Butler and Leicester City keeper Joe Wright.Edwards, Leigh; Gibbes, Jon; Lovis, John (1999). Torquay United, The Official Centenary History, 1899-1999. Yore Publications.   Finally it appeared that the Magpies had hit upon a winning formula and by early October they were second in the Third Division South table, just four points behind leaders Notts County.  Much of the upturn in Torquay's fortunes was due to the scoring prowess of new centre forward Jimmy Trotter who had already scored thirteen goals before the end of October and would go on to score a total of 28 goals in all competitions by the end of the season.  Trotter was ably assisted by two more new forwards in Billy Clayson and Albert Hutchinson, who contributed another 25 goals between them.

This was a notable match for Bob Smith as he was making his 100th appearance for the club, the first player to reach that landmark for Torquay United and he was, in fact, an ever-present for the Magpies this season appearing in all 46 games.  Protecting Joe Wright's goal was his namesake Jim Wright and Dick Hill while former Arsenal centre half Jack Butler was flanked in the midfield by Smith and Billy Clayson.  Clayson was unusually playing in the right half position having been replaced in his more accustomed role of inside forward by Harry Keeling in the previous match, an away trip to Gillingham.  Having scored two goals in that game, Keeling retained his position in the forward line forcing Clayson to make the switch into midfield, pushing Jim Wright into the right back position at the expense of Jack Fowler.  Taking the outside forward positions were Harry Waller and William Bell with Albert Hutchinson and potent centre forward Jimmy Trotter completing the forward line.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was Trotter who forced an unlikely replay by scoring his 18th goal of the season so far.", "|align=\"left\"|Billy Clayson", "|2 || FW ||  || Billy Clayson || 14 || 0 || 14", "|Billy Clayson"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["Torquay also had to make do without last season's top goalscorer Jimmy Trotter for the second half of the season after he was sold to Watford in December.Edwards, Leigh; Gibbes, Jon; Lovis, John (1999).
