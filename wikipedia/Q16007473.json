Russell-Cargill, a London-based Scot. The tournament was intended as a fundraiser for King Edward VII Hospital. It raised \u00a31,600; at a time when standard admission was a shilling, and stand seats cost five shillings. This became England's premier Sevens tournament:- it had some formidable figures on its sub-committee such as Wavell Wakefield and Bill Ramsay; it was close to London - and 10,000 spectators attended the second Middlesex tournament; and it helped rugby in London develop -  featuring the aforementioned Wavell Wakefield, Carl Aarvold (later Recorder of the City of London) of Blackheath FC, Wick Powell of London Welsh RFC, and John Tallent, who would later become chairman of the Four Home Unions Tours Committee. Invitation sides graced the Sevens tournament:- such as Sale RFC in 1936, which included such players as Wilf Wooller and Claude Davey of  and Ken Fyfe of  amongst their backs; and in 1939, Cardiff RFC, which included players such as Wilf Wooller again, and Les Spence and Wendy Davis."]}, {"page": "London Welsh RFC", "response": ["* Wick Powell 1927", "*  Wick Powell"]}, {"page": "1973 in Wales", "response": ["**Wick Powell, rugby player"]}, {"page": "Powell (surname)", "response": ["*Wick Powell (1905\u20131973), Welsh international rugby union footballer"]}, {"page": "Garndiffaith RFC", "response": ["Garndiffaith's top players include Billy Werret, who for five years was reserve inside half to Wick Powell of London Welsh and who went on to Captain Pontypool and Arthur Fynn went on to play at Pontypool and gain a Monmouthshire cap."]}, {"page": "Jerry Shea", "response": ["Born in Newport in 1892, Shea initially played rugby union with Pill Harriers, a notoriously tough team from Newport Docks. It was with Pill that Shea gained his first cap for Wales, against the post-war touring New Zealand Army. in 1919, like many Pill players, he switched to Newport RFC, the Harriers first-class rivals. The next year he was selected to play for Wales against England at St. Helens in the Five Nations Championship. Unsurprisingly for teams meeting for the first time since the end of the First World War, both teams contained many new caps. It was in this match that Shea would make history by scoring a try, conversion, drop goal, and penalty goal, the first player to do so at an international level.Griffiths (1988), pg 74. In a rain swept match, Shea opened the scoring in the first half with a penalty goal against the wind. England responded with a try and conversion, both from Harold Day, to take the first half 5\u20133. Within five minutes of the restart, Shea had drop kicked Wales back into the lead. With twenty minutes remaining, and the Welsh forwards in command, Shea broke through the English defence to score a try under the posts which he easily converted. Wick Powell then scored a second try for Wales, before Shea finished the match with another drop goal, for a convincing Welsh win.Griffiths (1988), pg 75."]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["Wales: Jack Bassett (Penarth) (capt.), Jack Morley (Newport), Claude Davey (Swansea), Frank Williams (Cardiff), Ronnie Boon (Cardiff), Dicky Ralph (Newport), Wick Powell (London Welsh), Tom Day (Swansea), Lonza Bowdler, (Cross Keys), Archie Skym (Cardiff), Ned Jenkins (Aberavon), Tom Arthur (Neath), Arthur Lemon (Neath), Watcyn Thomas (Swansea), Will Davies (Swansea)"]}, {"page": "Tommy Jones-Davies", "response": ["Jones-Davies was first selected to play for the Welsh national team in the country's opening game of the 1930 Five Nations Championship while team captain of London Welsh.
