Moorhead, who used a number of aliases, gave her name as 'Margaret Morrison'. Moorhead used her shoe to smash three cell windows and knocked the prison governor's hat off his head when he refused to remove it despite being in the presence of a lady. Moorhead wrote a letter to the prison commissioners, claiming that she and other suffragette prisoners were not being treated as political prisoners, and both women went on hunger strike. Ethel Moorhead was released on bail and Dorothea Smith was released under the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913, better known as the Cat and Mouse Act, on 29 July 2913 with a return date of 5 August 1913, but she did not return by that date.", "The case came to trial on 15 October 1913.\u00a0 Both women were sentenced to eight months imprisonment and found themselves back in Duke Street Prison, and went on hunger strike again.\u00a0 They were both released on temporary discharge on 20 October 1913 following a medical officer's report which stated that Ethel Moorhead was in an extremely feeble physical condition and that Dorothea Smith was very weak.\u00a0 Both women failed to return before the expiry of their licence on 27 October.\u00a0 Dorothea Smith was reported to be in her home, but Ethel Moorhead's whereabouts were unknown.\u00a0 Amidst rumours that Dorothea was pregnant, she was thereafter ordered to be kept under police surveillance in her home, though she later escaped.

In July of that year, Parker and a fellow campaigner, Ethel Moorhead attempted to set fire to Burns Cottage in Alloway. A watchman was on duty, and while Moorhead escaped, Parker was arrested. While on remand she went on hunger and thirst strike. Knowing that there was little chance of recapturing her if she was released, the prison authorities subjected her to particularly brutal force-feeding; when she was unable to hold down food, they attempted to feed her through her rectum, resulting in serious bruising. There was controversy when Parker wrote about her brutal treatment in 1914 in Votes for Women newspaper, under then name 'Janet Parker' . She was seriously ill when finally released to a nursing home, but was still able to escape.", "During the war, Parker served in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and was awarded an OBE. After the war she lived in Arcachon, near Bordeaux, where she died in 1924.

Her work and travel, however, had undermined her already-fragile health, and she contracted pneumonia while in Dundee. She died on 23 July 1896 at the age of 29. Her mother had travelled from Lincoln to be at her bedside, and her family purchased a plot in Balgay Cemetery in the city, where she was buried 24 hours later.
