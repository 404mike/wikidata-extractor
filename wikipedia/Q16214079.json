Paddy Kelly resigned as manager before the 2009\u201310 season started, with former Cliftonville and Coleraine player Pat McAllister replacing him. In June 2010, a few weeks after guiding the club back into the top flight for the 2010\u201311 IFA Premiership season with a 1\u20130 aggregate win over Institute in the promotion play-off, McAllister agreed a new deal to stay as manager for the 2010\u201311 season. However, less than a month later he shocked the club by resigning, citing personal reasons for his decision.", "Former Carrick Rangers boss Stephen Small was appointed Kelly's successor a few days later. However, Small's tenure would not be a successful one. The club suffered a run of 15 league games without a win, which included 12 defeats and 3 draws. They were also knocked out of the 2012\u201313 Irish League Cup at home, by IFA Championship 1 outfit Harland & Wolff Welders. Small resigned in September 2012, citing poor results and personal pressures as the reasons for his departure. Reserve team manager Declan McGreevy, a former Ards and Ballymena United player, was appointed as the club's next manager on 11 October 2012. Ten days later however, McGreevy was forced to stand down from the post as he did not possess the required UEFA 'A' licence to manage an IFA Premiership club. Former manager Pat McAllister was immediately announced as McGreevy's replacement, returning to the club for a second spell as manager. The club was also involved in some controversy that season, when they were deducted 3 points and fined \u00a3500 for fielding a suspended player in a 2\u20131 win over Lisburn Distillery \u2013 the result was changed to a 3\u20130 loss. The club maintained that the IFA had given them verbal clearance for the player to take part in the match, but did not appeal the decision.", "The club ended the season in the relegation play-off place (11th), and faced the runners-up of Championship 1, Warrenpoint Town, for a place in next season's Premiership. The tie ended 2\u20132 on aggregate with Warrenpoint Town winning on the away goals rule. This relegated Donegal Celtic to the second tier. In August 2013, five days prior to the start of the 2013\u201314 NIFL Championship season \u2013 the club's first season back in the second tier, manager Pat McAllister along with his entire backroom staff and several first team players all quit the club following a club meeting. McAllister stated that he could no longer work under the conditions and restrictions that were imposed during the meeting as a result of the club's difficult financial situation.
