In total Aaron spent a year in hospital, receiving treatment and recovering.In 2007 Aaron began to get involved in wheelchair races and raised money for a Meningitis charity by completing a 10 km race in Totton. He has also completed 2 London Marathons (2008 & 2009) and in 2009 was ranked 4th UK Male in both the London Marathon and the Adidas Silverstone Half Marathon.On 23 May 2016 Phipps became the first disabled British person to scale Mount Kilimanjaro During large parts of the ascent Phipps was forced to climb on his hands and knees because the wheelchair wasn't capable of traversing the difficult terrain but was able to complete the climb without any assistance.\nHe was told that he had to be carried up the mountain, but he refused. When climbing the mountain it took twice the time it was predicted to take. On the third day, the wheelchair wasn't capable of traversing up the mountain anymore and so Aaron decided to use knee pads in order to be able to reach the top, with his father carrying the wheelchair.Phipps was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to wheelchair rugby.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain national wheelchair rugby team", "response": ["| 13 || 3.5 || Aaron Phipps || 1983-04-07 ||  Team Solent Sharks ||", "*2012 Paralympic Games: David Anthony, Andy Barrow, Steve Brown (captain), Jonathan Coggan, Kylie Grimes, Bulbul Hussain, Mike Kerr, Ross Morrison, Myles Pearson, Aaron Phipps, Mandip Sehmi, Coach: Tom O'Connor", "*2020 Paralympic Games: Ayaz Bhuta, Jonathan Coggan, Ryan Cowling, Nicholas Cummins, Kylie Grimes, Aaron Phipps, Jim Roberts, Stuart Robinson, Chris Ryan, Jack Smith, Jamie Stead, Gavin Walker, Coach: Paul Shaw"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics", "response": ["*Aaron Phipps"]}, {"page": "David Anthony (wheelchair rugby)", "response": ["In 2012, Anthony was selected as part of the Great Britain team to play in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London.
