He was a lifelong campaigner on behalf of the Liberal Party, and was said to have had an effect in Hastings constituency on the 1859 general election. The Tories alleged corruption by Howell but lost their case. Howell's local influence was believed to have assisted two Liberals, Frederick North and Harry Vane, to win the election instead of one Liberal and one Tory as had been expected. After the 1882 council elections: \"The Liberals had issued writs in the High Court of Justice charging Cllrs Edwin Smith (All Saints ward), George Edmed (St Clements ward) and George Archibald Thorpe (Holy Trinity ward) with bribery, undue influence, giving \u2018treats\u2019 and hiring vehicles to convey voters to the polls\". The Liberals lost their case, but were still supported by the Hastings News, a Liberal newspaper. In response the Tories issued a writ accusing Howell of perjury, citing the method of payment by Howell to Mr Kendal, a private investigator hired to discover evidence of corruption by the Tories in the 1882 election. The Tories were supported by the Hastings Observer, which \"took great delight in the failure of the Liberal case, highlighting the poor quality evidence\". The same newspaper \"also revived the 1869 case, arguing forcefully that the two Liberals had been elected wrongly\". The Tories lost their case against Howell."]}, {"page": "List of UK Parliamentary election petitions", "response": ["| 1868 || Hastings (No.\u00a01) || Edward Barker Sutton and Robert Ransom || Frederick North || Bribery, etc. || Duly elected ||rowspan=2| Brassey's lavish spending on his household was not illegal even if it intended to influence the election; to be illegal it must aim at a particular vote.
