Besides the political reasons there was also the \"ideological conflict\" between the two systems. Moreover, as Louise Fawcett argues, among many important areas of contention, or perhaps more accurately of anxiety, were, first, the desires of the superpowers to gain strategic advantage in the region, second, the fact that the region contained some two-thirds of the world's oil reserves in a context where oil was becoming increasingly vital to the economy of the Western world [...]Louise, Fawcett.

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the region has experienced both periods of relative peace and tolerance and periods of conflict particularly between Sunnis and Shiites."]}, {"page": "1926 Women's World Games", "response": ["|Louise Fawcett||45.41 m"]}, {"page": "England at the 1934 British Empire Games", "response": ["|Louise Fawcett  || none"]}, {"page": "List of British champions in discus throw", "response": ["|Louise Fawcett"]}, {"page": "List of British champions in javelin throw", "response": ["|Louise Fawcett", "|Louise Fawcett"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1934 British Empire Games \u2013 Women's javelin throw", "response": ["| 4 ||align=left| Louise Fawcett ||align=left|  ||  ||"]}]}}
