Beginning in the early 1980s, his music engineering included artists such as Pete Ham, Badfinger, New Edition, The Monkees, Manhattan Transfer, Frankie Valli, The Beach Boys, The Pandoras, Dean Ford, The Babys, James Lee Stanley, Primetime, The Long Ryders, 5 Guns West, Radio Cammon, Easter, The Rats, Derrick Anderson, Blood on the Saddle.[2] and Jigsaw Seen.\nHis production work included Dean Ford, House of Freaks, Badfinger, Pete Ham The Clints, Karmann, On The Air.\nIn the early 1990s, Matovina began his research for his biography of the rock band Badfinger entitled Without You: The Tragic Story Of Badfinger (first published in 1997). A revised edition was made available in 2000 with a CD of rarities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Badfinger", "response": ["While in a 1988 readers poll for Goldmine magazine, Straight Up (1971) ranked as the most-requested CD release among out-of-print albums, the album made it to CD only in 1993. In 1995, Molland was paid to re-record the 10 most popular Badfinger songs. These recordings were variously packaged in the market, often showing the original 1970s line-up of the band with little or no disclaiming information, despite Molland being the only original member of Badfinger who performed. A detailed biography of Badfinger by Dan Matovina was published in 1998, titled Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger. The 2000 update of the book was accompanied by a CD of rare material and interviews.", "In 2000, a rough mix version of Head First (taken from an open-reel tape prepared by Apple engineer Phil McDonald in December 1974) was released on CD. (According to Dan Matovina, Warner Brothers could not locate the original master tapes for remixing at that time, but they were eventually found about 10 years later.) In 2002, Gibbins released a two-disc set of a Badfinger performance recorded in Indiana, on 19 October 1982, which had been captured on a basic cassette recorder, which was initially (and inaccurately) titled Live 83 \u2013 DBA-BFR. The band at that time had consisted of Evans, Gibbins, Jackson, Kailing and Dacus.", "On 27 April 2013 an official blue plaque was unveiled by the Swansea City Council to honour Pete Ham in his home town of Swansea. The public event was also attended by two former members of the original Badfinger band, The Iveys, Ron Griffiths and Dai Jenkins, plus former Badfinger member, Bob Jackson. The plaque, designed by Dan Matovina, honored Pete and all the Iveys and Badfinger members of Pete Ham's lifetime. A concert followed the unveiling of the plaque featuring former Badfinger members Bob Jackson and Al Wodtke."]}, {"page": "No Dice", "response": ["The single from this LP, \"No Matter What\", peaked in the United States at number\u00a08 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1970. The song is often regarded as an early offering in the power pop genre. The album also contains the original version of \"Without You\". Although Badfinger did not release the song as a single in Europe or North America, it was taken to number\u00a01 on the Billboard charts in 1972 by Harry Nilsson, and became a hit for Mariah Carey in 1994. \"Without You\" has been the top money-earner for Badfinger in publishing royalties, having been covered by over 180 artists. The song was also picked to provide the title for Dan Matovina's 1997 biography Without You: The Tragic Story Of Badfinger."]}, {"page": "Straight Up (Badfinger album)", "response": ["The Pete Ham-written \"Name of the Game\" was scheduled for release as a single \u2013 only for Phil Spector, as de facto head of A&R at Apple, to cancel the release. According to author Richard Williams, Spector deemed the track an inadequate follow-up to the band's hit single off No Dice, \"No Matter What\".Williams, p. 159. Although Badfinger guitarist Joey Molland has said that Harrison was responsible for the Emerick recordings being rejected, the band's biographer, Dan Matovina, writes that the rejection had in fact come from Allan Steckler, head of Apple's US operation, where most of the record label's decisions were now made.Matovina, pp. 125, 133. Spector and Harrison then submitted a remixed version of \"Name of the Game\", on 23 April, which also met with disapproval from Steckler.Matovina, p. 133. While the band were in New York during the tour, they attended a session at Bell Studio, where Al Kooper overdubbed piano and organ onto the track; Kooper's subsequent mix of the song was similarly unsuccessful.", "In his 1979 article on the band in Trouser Press, Dan Matovina bemoaned Harrison's reworking of \"Day After Day\" into \"a distinct copy of his own sound\", from the point of view of Badfinger's career, while describing the song and \"Baby Blue\" as \"dazzling hits\". Matovina concluded of Straight Up: \"What came out was a great album due to the tremendous songs, but one which lacked overall vitality. Also, in the process of the recording, many brilliant tracks were discarded ... All the [released] songs are top rate, it's a wholly consistent well-done record, only not exactly what the group desired.\"", "*Dan Matovina \u2013 research"]}, {"page": "Blood on the Saddle", "response": ["In early 1987, the band recorded with engineer/producer Dan Matovina and Ethan James what was to be the original line-up's third and last album Fresh Blood. This was released in North America and on New Rose in Europe, but the band had broken up by that time. Disappointing sales led to the band breaking up, with Davis forming a new band The Drivers and Senac joining The Loafin' Hyenas followed by Crowbar Salvation and The Guilty Hearts. Botelho next worked with Bobbi Bratt.Hochman, Steve & Spurrier, Jeff (1987). \"Local Heroes Do Their Anti-Nuke Bits\", Los Angeles Times, November 29, 1987, p. 92."]}]}}
