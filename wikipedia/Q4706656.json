Frost ,  (born 29 March 1943) is an Australian academic based at La Trobe University. A major theme of his research has involved the European exploration of the Pacific Ocean over the second half of the eighteenth century. He is best known for books in which he challenges common historical stereotypes and misconceptions concerning the colonisation of Australia. These include Botany Bay Mirages: Illusions of Australia's Convict Beginnings, Botany Bay: The Real Story, The First Fleet: The Real Story, and Mutiny, Mayhem, Mythology: Bounty's Enigmatic Voyage. Frost's arguments radically challenge those expressed by prominent historians Manning Clark and Robert Hughes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Australia", "response": ["There has been a longstanding debate over whether the key consideration in the decision to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay was the pressing need to find a solution to the penal management problem, or whether broader imperial goals \u2014 such as trade, securing new supplies of timber and flax for the navy, and the desirability of strategic ports in the region \u2014 were paramount.Christopher, Emma; Maxwell-Stewart, Hamish (2013). \"Convict transportation in global context c. 1700-88\".

James Mario later settled in England.  Australian historians remember him for his misbehaviour aboard James Cook's Endeavour on its voyage of exploration to New Holland in 1768\u201370. Magra was suspected of snipping off the earlobes of Cook's drunken and alcoholic clerk after stripping him naked while he was drunk.  During this voyage, Magra became acquainted with Sir Joseph Banks, and their friendship lasted until his death. Circumstantial evidence has identified Magra as the anonymous author of A Journal of a Voyage Round the World, which appeared two months after his return to England in 1771, and which offered some details of Cook's voyage not found in other accounts.", "His biographer, Alan Frost, in 1995, noted that \"silence covered Matra's activities until March 1777\", when he applied for leave from his post as consul at Teneriffe in the Canary Islands to deal with family matters in British-occupied New York.

The welcoming review of historian Alan Frost discusses the importance of Cook's second journey at length. Forster's writing is described as the \"most lyrical of all the large narratives of Europe's reconnaissance of the Pacific\", but also \"stilted and his literary analogies too frequent and forced\". The historian Paul Turnbull notes the book has been \"overshadowed for 200 years by Cook's lavishly illustrated account\" and praises the editors, contrasting their approach against received Eurocentric Cook scholarship. The anthropologist Roger Neich, calling the edition \"magnificent\", comments that the \"narrative initiated a stage in the evolution of travel writing as a literary genre, representing an insightful empiricism and empathy showing that the 'Noble Savage' was not a complete description\". The cultural historian Rod Edmond, while calling Cook's report \"often dull\" and Reinhold Forster's Observations \"a meditation on the voyage but not the thing itself\", states the book \"combines the immediacy of experience with developed reflection upon it, and is much better written than anything by either Cook or his own father\".

He noted that some of those abandoned in rock shelters seemed to have died of thirst while too sick to seek water, and that children had often perished beside a dead parent.William Bradley's Voyage to New South Wales edited by Colin Choat at Project Gutenberg Australia, State Library of New South Wales, 2019 (based on William Bradley's Journal, December 1786 \u2014 May 1792),  p. 162. Busby, as mentioned below, made similar suggestions in 1831. Another naval officer John Hunter agreed that thirst or hunger had increased the mortality of sufferers \u201cimmediately deserted by their friends and left to perish in their helpless situation for want of sustenance.\u201dJohn Hunter, An Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson [\u2026] 1787-1792, 1793, John Stockdale,  London, p.143; Robert Barnes, An Unlikely Leader: The Life and Times of Captain John Hunter, Sydney University Press, 2009, pp. 151-152. Judy Campbell in her 2002 book Invisible Invaders summed up that the disease\u2019s initial impact in 1789 \u201cwas especially severe because of shock, flight, and fear, as well as the virus itself.\u201d Campbell p. 98. Bradley, unlike Tench, thought it an open question whether the Aborigines were previously \"strangers\" to smallpox,Bradley p. 162:  \"whether they were strangers to it before is doubtful.\" while Lieutenant King in his journal was sure they were not;Cumpston p. 166. and this has remained a point of contention among historians. Most point to the lack of visible scarring at first contact; but some, including Robert Barnes and Alan Frost, feel that since three observers, King, Hunter and Collins \"demonstrated that the Aborigines had a name for it\", the disease was more likely a pre-existing, if infrequent, visitor.Barnes, 2009, pp. 164-165.

The numbers of people travelling in the fleets were large enough to sustain smallpox for extended periods of time without it \u201cburning out\u201d.

Campbell also cites British historian Charles Wilson, who cited \"medical microbiology\" in disagreeing with Butlin about the origins of the 1789 outbreak, and \"doubted his estimates of its demographic impact\", as well as \"First Fleet historian Alan Frost [who] also disagreed with Butlin's views\".Invisible Invaders, p 31."]}]}}
