He received the Clarence Derwent Award as Most Promising Male Newcomer in 1986. Later that year, his performance in the Broadway revival of John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves earned him a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. \nMahoney first became known for his roles in such films as John Patrick Shanley's romantic comedy Moonstruck (1987), Barry Levinson's comedy Tin Men, John Sayles' sports drama Eight Men Out (1988), Cameron Crowe's romantic drama Say Anything... (1989), the Coen brothers' Barton Fink (1991), and The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire (1993), and Rob Reiner's political romance The American President (1995).

Included in the series cast were Peri Gilpin as Roz Doyle, Frasier's call screener on his radio show, and Jane Leeves as Daphne Moon, Martin's live-in caretaker.", "* John Mahoney as Martin Crane, Frasier and Niles's father, is an outspoken and laid-back Seattle police detective who was forced to retire after sustaining a gunshot wound to his hip. Due to this injury preventing him from being capable of living alone, upon Frasier's return to Seattle, Martin is forced to accept Frasier's invitation to live with him. Though he and his sons share few commonalities, the relationship between the three men strengthens throughout the series.  Martin's relationship with his Jack Russell terrier, Eddie and his pea-green recliner, are a perpetual source of distress for Frasier. He is also known for his fondness for beer (specifically that for Ballantine).", "Talks of a revival began in 2016, but were initially denied by Grammer, though they resurfaced in mid- to late 2018, with Grammer confirming they were looking into it. In February and March 2019, he said in several interviews that a reboot was likely. Grammer has said the revival will be a \"third act\" for the Frasier Crane character and is likely to be in a new setting other than Seattle. He has also indicated a new series will pay tribute to John Mahoney, who died in 2018.", "Some cast members of Frasier had appeared previously in minor roles on Cheers. In the episode \"Do Not Forsake Me, O' My Postman\" (1992), John Mahoney played Sy Flembeck, an over-the-hill jingle writer hired by Rebecca to write a jingle for the bar. In it, Grammer and Mahoney exchanged a few lines.
