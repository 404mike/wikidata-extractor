The young Milburn idolised Joe Hulme, and hoped to emulate him.

Reflecting later, Milburn contended that \"maybe my father's intentions were the best in the world...but that thrashing laid the foundations for an inferiority complex I've fought all my life to overcome\". When he was twelve, Milburn moved to Hirst East Senior Boys School and was selected to play right-wing for the school football team. His father promised to award him a penny for every goal he scored.
