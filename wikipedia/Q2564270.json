Splendid was one of the first submarines to reach the islands, arriving mid-April, after sailing from Faslane. Unlike , Splendid did not directly engage Argentinian forces, however she shadowed the Argentine aircraft carrier 25 de Mayo, with Splendid running within a mile outside of the Argentinian territorial line,  off its Atlantic coast. The captain of Splendid claimed, that running on the edge of the exclusion zone around the Falklands, declared by the UK government, he had the right in international law and approval from the British PM, to fire at 25 de Mayo, a couple of miles away within Argentine waters, and would have fired MK 8 torpedoes at 25 de Mayo, if he had confirmed his precise position. But just at the moment, he lost sight through the periscope of the carrier and was not immediately able to regain contact. The Naval Commander of the task force, Admiral Sandy Woodward, does not appear to be entirely clear, that Splendid had the right to fire, but says he established, against his prior view, that Splendid had orders to engage and approval of the PM. Splendid did however provide valuable reconnaissance to the British Task Force on Argentine aircraft movements. Splendids presence along with Conqueror effectively restricted the freedom of action of the Argentine Navy, which spent most of the war confined to port."]}, {"page": "USS Coral Sea (CV-43)", "response": ["The Coral Sea battle group, under Rear Admiral Tom Brown, was involved in exercises with the Royal Navy under Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward \u2013 who operated with  as his flagship.

A request from Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, the commander of the British aircraft carrier group heading south, on 11 April for recommendations for targets to attack in the Falkland Islands led to reconsideration of the possibility of attacks using Vulcans.
