Green served on the European continent until 1752, after which he was in Canada. There, he continued to advance through both the ordinary military and engineering ranks.\nFollowing his return to England, Green was named senior engineer for Gibraltar about 1761, and the next year promoted to lieutenant colonel. He was promoted to chief engineer for Gibraltar in 1770, and designed and executed a number of military works on the Rock. In 1772, his idea of a regiment of military artificers, to replace the civilian mechanics who had formerly constructed military works, came to fruition in the form of the Soldier Artificer Company, the predecessor of the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners. Their works included the King's Bastion, which Green designed. Promoted to colonel in 1777, he served as chief engineer throughout the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779\u20131783). During the siege, he was promoted to brigadier general, then major general. He returned to England in 1783; three years later a baronetcy was created for him. He was appointed chief engineer of Great Britain in 1786. His promotions included that to lieutenant general in 1793 and full general in 1798. Following his retirement in 1802, he settled in Plumstead, Kent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Green", "response": ["William Green may refer to", "*William Green (American football) (born 1979), American football player", "*William Green (footballer) (1881\u20131966), Notts County F.C., Nottingham Forest F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*William Green (cricketer, born 1817) (1817\u20131870), English batsman playing for Kent", "*William Green (cricketer, born 1834) (1834\u20131876), English batsman playing for Kent", "*William Green (cricketer, born 1852) (1852\u20131924), English cricketer fro Marylebone Cricket Club", "*William Green (baseball) (1894\u20131925), Negro leagues third baseman", "*William Green (fl.1406), MP for Lewes", "*William Green (died 1555), MP for Downton", "*William Green (MP for Poole), in 1563 and 1572, MP for Poole", "*William Green (lawyer) (1806\u20131880), Virginia lawyer, son of John W.

The most prominent new work was the King's Bastion designed by Sir William Green and built by the Soldier Artificer Company on the main waterfront of the town in Gibraltar. The King's Bastion comprised a stone battery holding 26 heavy guns and mortars, with barracks and casemates to house a full battalion of foot.
