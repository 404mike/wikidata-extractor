The band took their name from an episode of radio comedy programme The Goon Show. The band are unusual for using two bass-players in their line-up: Alex Griffin plays melody lines high up on one bass, and Matt Cheslin plays the regular bass lines on the other. This gives the band a tense and highly driven sub-hardcore sound featuring distorted effects-laden guitar and energetic drums.The band was formed at sixth-form college and they recorded their first album while some members were still teenagers. This led to a strong teenaged fanbase with a reputation for enjoying crowd-surfing and moshing at their gigs. The band was also noted (and occasionally ridiculed) for their early image, which consisted of uniformly crimped hair and a predilection for sporting shorts and band or skateboard T-shirts. \"The Neds\" (as their fans referred to them) were well known for their own distinctive T-shirts, reportedly producing over 86 different designs within three years (1987\u20131990). In 2009, Jonn Penney stated, \"We're still adding designs - old habits die hard\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stourbridge", "response": ["* Jonn Penney, musician - Ned's Atomic Dustbin"]}, {"page": "Ned's Atomic Dustbin", "response": ["The band was formed at sixth-form college and they recorded their first album while some members were still teenagers.

His favourite albums include Closing Time by Tom Waits and Architecture & Morality by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). Ned's Atomic Dustbin quickly gathered a strong fanbase after being offered a support slot by local heroes The Wonder Stuff on their 1989 and 1990 UK tours. During 1990, Ned's Atomic Dustbin signed with Birmingham-based indie label Chapter 22 Records for their debut release, The Ingredients EP, followed by a single, \"Kill Your Television\", which reached No.\u00a092 and No.\u00a053 respectively in the UK singles chart. \"Kill Your Television\" also topped the UK independent singles chart. This, combined with their acclaimed live reputation, drew a huge crowd to their afternoon appearance on the main stage of the Reading Festival in August 1990. The buzz created was significant enough to catalyse the interest of major record labels. One final single for Chapter 22 followed, \"Until You Find Out\", but distribution problems meant that many fans were left unable to purchase copies, thus stunting its chart progress. It eventually stalled at No.\u00a051. Frustrated, the band finally decided to sign to Sony Records, on the proviso that they be allowed to release their music through their own Furtive label - thus regaining a higher degree of creative control while still enjoying the benefit of the major label's distribution and advertising clout.", "thumb|right|Vocalist Jonn Penney with a fan at a gig in Wolverhampton, December 2007", "** Jonn Penney - vocals"]}, {"page": "God Fodder", "response": ["God Fodder combines grebo music, a \"punk-influenced, electronica-informed, hyper, light-hearted rock\" genre with which the band were associated, with shoegaze music, a genre which forms the album's \"prevailing beat\". The album was described as a \"blend of frenzied, melodic rock, with the occasional touch of quirkiness\", such as the band's usage of two bass players, with Matt Cheslin playing \"normal basslines\" whilst Alex Griffin \"scratching out harmonic riffs.\" Besides the twin bass work, the album also features complicated drum beats and distorted guitars throughout. Trouser Press said the album combines catchy melodies, \"pulsing adrenaline beats\" and \"a wool-covered wall of fuzzy pop noise on which able singer Jonn Penney pastes challenging personal lyrics.\"", "Like several bands of the era, the band's bassist Alex Griffin explained that the songs on God Fodder were \"communal efforts\", saying \"It's a lot more gratifying than working with just a single songwriter. One person brings in a 10-second idea and we build on that. It's definitely a group thing,\" adding that \"When people tell me what one of our songs means, I say, 'Yep, you're right.' I'm not gonna dash their dreams.\" \"Selfish\" is a critique on \"trendies, the apathetic and mean-spirited,\" and opens with a sample of the Die Hard dialogue \"why don't you wake up and smell what you're shovelling?,\" which the band included after watching the film and decided it \"fitted in really well.\"  \"Happy\" was written by lead singer Jonn Penney, who, as Griffin explained, \"writes really vague and about personal situations not necessarily his own. He doesn't like to explain.\" Penney's lyrics on God Fodder have been described as personal and challenging."]}, {"page": "Are You Normal?", "response": ["* Jonn Penney - Vocals"]}, {"page": "Miles Hunt", "response": ["His former girlfriend was Helga Phillips (educated at Goldsmiths College), who is now the partner of Jonn Penney, the lead singer of Ned's Atomic Dustbin, and who designed the distinctive covers of Ned's albums.Ned's Atomic Dustbin"]}, {"page": "Brainbloodvolume", "response": ["* Jonn Penney - vocals"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wolverhampton", "response": ["* Jonn Penney (born 1968) \u2013 singer of Ned's Atomic Dustbin"]}, {"page": "Groundswell", "response": ["* Groundswell, a band created by Jonn Penney"]}, {"page": "Jonn", "response": ["* Jonn Penney (born 1968), English musician"]}]}}
