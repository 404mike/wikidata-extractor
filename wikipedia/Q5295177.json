He was a Lecturer in Hebrew at  St David's College, Lampeter until 1870 when he became  Rector of St Mary de Crypt, Gloucester. From 1877 to 1886 he was Rural Dean of St Pancras when he became Dean of Gloucester, a post he held until his death. As Dean, he banned performances of Edward Elgar's choral work The Dream of Gerontius from Gloucester Cathedral from 1900 until 1910 because of Roman Catholic references in its text. He adopted, additionally, the surname Jones (his wife's maiden name) in 1904. At some point he became a Doctor of Divinity (DD).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Samuel", "response": ["This event established that Samuel was now \"established as a prophet of the Lord\" and \"all Israel from Dan to Beersheba\" became aware of his prophetic calling.

It is usually taken to mean a simple negative: \"not\": chabod signifying \"glory\", I-chabod thus represents \"not glory\", i.e., there is no glory. Others render the \"I\" syllable as a rhetorical question, \"Where?\", \"Where is the glory?\", the answer, of course, being, \"It is nowhere\". But it is also possible to read the syllable \"I\" as an exclamation of bitter sorrow, \"Alas!\": the name then could be translated, \"Alas! the glory\".Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on 1 Samuel 4, accessed 23 April 2017"]}, {"page": "Peace of the Church", "response": ["In 293 Constantius Chlorus, former Praetorian prefect, was appointed Caesar to Maximian.

In 303, Diocletian (284-305) and the tetrarchy launched the last and bloodiest persecution, the enforcement of religious conformity being part of his program to restore stability and unity in the wake of the Crisis of the Third Century. The campaign was avidly pursued by Galerius, who noticed that Constantius was well-disposed towards the Christians, and who saw it as a method of advancing his career prospects with the aging Diocletian. Of the four Tetrarchs, Constantius made the least effort to implement the decrees in the western provinces that were under his direct authority,Southern, Pat.
