She is an authority on the Frankish kingdoms in the eighth and ninth centuries AD, who uses palaeographical and manuscript studies to illuminate aspects of the political, cultural, intellectual, religious, and social history of the Early Middle Ages. From 1999 until 2016 she was Professor of Medieval History and Director of Research at the University of Cambridge. She is a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College and Professor Emerita of Medieval History in the University of Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Halloween", "response": ["Christian minister Prince Sorie Conteh linked the wearing of costumes to the belief in vengeful ghosts: \"It was traditionally believed that the souls of the departed wandered the earth until All Saints' Day, and All Hallows' Eve provided one last chance for the dead to gain vengeance on their enemies before moving to the next world. In order to avoid being recognized by any soul that might be seeking such vengeance, people would don masks or costumes\". It is claimed that in the Middle Ages, churches that were too poor to display relics of martyred saints at Allhallowtide let parishioners dress up as saints instead. Some Christians observe this custom at Halloween today.\"Eve of All Saints\", Using Common Worship: Times and Seasons \u2013 All Saints to Candlemas (David Kennedy), Church House Publishing, p. 42 Lesley Bannatyne believes this could have been a Christianization of an earlier pagan custom.Bannatyne, Lesley. Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History. Pelican Publishing, 1998. p. 9 Many Christians in mainland Europe, especially in France, believed \"that once a year, on Hallowe'en, the dead of the churchyards rose for one wild, hideous carnival\" known as the danse macabre, which was often depicted in church decoration.Perry, Edward Baxter. Descriptive Analyses of Piano Works; For the Use of Teachers, Players, and Music Clubs. Theodore Presser Company, 1902. p. 276 Christopher Allmand and Rosamond McKitterick write in The New Cambridge Medieval History that the danse macabre urged Christians \"not to forget the end of all earthly things\". The danse macabre was sometimes enacted at village pageants and court masques, with people \"dressing up as corpses from various strata of society\", and this may be the origin of Halloween costume parties."]}, {"page": "Carolingian Empire", "response": ["The palace system as an idea for Carolingian central administration and governance has been challenged by historian F. L. Ganshof who argued that the palaces of the Carolingians 'contained nothing resembling the specialised services and departments available at the same period to the Byzantine emperor or the caliph of Baghdad.' However, further reading in the works of Carolingian historians such as Matthew Innes, Rosamond McKitterick, and Stuart Airlie suggest that the use of palaces were important in the evolution of Carolingian governance and Janet Nelson has argued that 'palaces are places from which power emanates and is exercised...' and the importance of palaces to Carolingian administration, learning, and legitimacy has been widely argued."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Rosamond McKitterick (born 1949), medieval"]}, {"page": "Rosamond", "response": ["*Rosamond McKitterick (born 1949), British medieval historian"]}, {"page": "List of historians by area of study", "response": ["* Rosamond McKitterick (born 1949) \u2013 Frankish and Carolingian history"]}, {"page": "Neume", "response": ["Around the 9th century neumes began to become shorthand mnemonic aids for the proper melodic recitation of chant.One of the earliest examples is the Planctus de obitu Karoli (c.814), which was provided neumatic notation in the 10th century, cf. Rosamond McKitterick (2008), Charlemagne: The Formation of a European Identity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, ), 225 n54. For the lyrics, see Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 206\u201311. A prevalent view is that neumatic notation was first developed in the Eastern Roman Empire. This seems plausible given the well-documented peak of musical composition and cultural activity in major cities of the empire (now regions of southern Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel) at that time. The corpus of extant Byzantine music in manuscript and printed form is far larger than that of the Gregorian chant, due in part to the fact that neumes fell into disuse in the west after the rise of modern staff notation and with it the new techniques of polyphonic music, while the Eastern tradition of Greek orthodox church music and the reformed neume notation remains alive today."]}, {"page": "Hildegard of the Vinzgau", "response": ["It is generally accepted that she was either 12 or 13 upon her marriage to Charlemagne.Johannes Fried: \"Charlemagne\", Harvard University Press 2016, p. 96Rosamond McKitterick: \"Charlemagne: The Formation of a European Identity\", Cambridge University Press 2008, p. 90, though her nominal date of birth would place her at 17. Girls could be married at any time after puberty, and in Roman law, which the Church upheld, the age of 12 was well established as being adequate.Achim Thomas Hack: Alter, Krankheit, Tod und Herrschaft im fr\u00fchen Mittelalter, (= Monographien zur Geschichte des Mittelalters 56), Stuttgart 2009, p. 51. An intense physical relationship between the spouses was demonstrated by the fact that, during her 12 years of marriage, Hildegard had 8 pregnancies (including one set of twins). Quite remarkably, the chronicles never mention either miscarriages or stillbirths, indicating that she was of sturdy health despite her young age at the time of the wedding.", "Hildegard made several donations to the monasteries of St. Denis and St. Martin of Tours.Klaus Schreiner: \"Hildegardis regina\".

In a strict sense, the Pippinids are the descendants of Pippin of Landen and the Arnulfings those of Arnulf of Metz, which groups only overlap in the marriage of Arnulf's son Ansegisel and Pippin's daughter Begga and their son, Pippin of Herstal and his descendants.Constance Bouchard, Rewriting Saints and Ancestors: Memory and Forgetting in France, 500\u20131200 (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015), p. 112."]}]}}
