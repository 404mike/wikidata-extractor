Primitive people believed, he argued, that they were descended from the same species as their totemic animal. Subsequent debate by the \"armchair anthropologists\" (including J. J. Bachofen, \u00c9mile Durkheim, and Sigmund Freud) remained focused on totemism rather than animism, with few directly challenging Tylor's definition. Anthropologists \"have commonly avoided the issue of animism and even the term itself rather than revisit this prevalent notion in light of their new and rich ethnographies\"."]}, {"page": "Early infanticidal childrearing", "response": ["Nineteenth-century British anthropology advanced a lineal, evolutionary sequence in a given culture from savagery to civilization. Cultures were seen on a hierarchical ladder. James George Frazer posited a universal progress from magical thinking to science. Most anthropologists of the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century studied primitive cultures outside Europe and North America. John Ferguson McLennan, Lewis Henry Morgan, and others argued that there was a parallel development in social institutions. In the 1950s, led by Leslie White, these evolutionist ideas gained influence in American anthropology."]}, {"page": "Andrew Lang", "response": ["Lang is now chiefly known for his publications on folklore, mythology, and religion.

The Classical British Evolutionary School, primarily at Oxford University, divided society into two evolutionary stages, savagery and civilization, based on the archaeology of John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. Upadhyay and Pandey list its adherents as  Robert Ranulph Marett, Henry James Sumner Maine, John Ferguson McLennan, and James George Frazer, as well as Tylor. Marett was the last man standing, dying in 1943. By the time of his death, Lubbock's archaeology had been updated. The American School, beginning with Lewis Henry Morgan, was likewise superseded, both being replaced by the Neoevolutionist School, beginning with V. Gordon Childe. It brought the archaeology up-to-date and tended to omit the intervening society names, such as savagery; for example, Neolithic is both a tool tradition and a form of society."]}, {"page": "Totem", "response": ["Early anthropologists and ethnologists like James George Frazer, Alfred Cort Haddon, John Ferguson McLennan and W.

Professor Edward Evans-Pritchard, while praising Smith for his discussion of the tribe [hayy], finds his theories about an early matriarchy wanting. Smith conceived feminine names for tribes as \"survivals\" of matriarchy, but they may merely reflect grammar, i.e., \"collective terms in Arabic are constantly feminine\", or lineage practice, i.e., \"in a polygamous society the children of one father may be distinguished into groups by use of their mothers' names\". Evans-Pritchard also concludes that \"Smith makes out no case for the ancient Bedouin being totemic\" but only for their \"interest in nature\".
