His father was originally from Newry, County Armagh, Ireland, and his mother was originally from Stranraer, Wigtownshire, Scotland. He followed his father into the pits at the age of 12. At the age of 27 the Miner's Union sent him to Ruskin College, Oxford where he obtained, with distinction, a Diploma in Economics and Political Science. He then resumed his career in the coal mining industry as a Checkweighman.\nMcKay was elected as Member of Parliament for Wallsend at the 1945 general election, and was re-elected at four subsequent elections until his retirement at the 1964 general election, where he was succeeded by Ted Garrett. He was made a Freeman of the Borough of Wallsend on 25 April 1963, an honour shared with Aneurin Bevan, who was granted it on 18 October 1952.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John McKay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John McKay"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| John McKay"]}, {"page": "John MacKay", "response": ["*John McKay (director), British film and television director", "*John McKay (mathematician) (born 1939), mathematician at Concordia University", "*John McKay (musician), British guitarist and former member of Siouxsie & the Banshees", "*John McKay (pianist) (born 1938), Canadian-American pianist", "*John McKay (attorney) (born 1956), United States Attorney for the Western District of the state of Washington", "*John McKay (police officer) (1912\u20132004), British police inspector", "*John McKay (British politician) (1883\u20131964), British Labour Party MP for Wallsend, 1945\u20131964", "*John McKay (MPP) (1841\u2013?), Ontario physician and political figure", "*John McKay (politician) (born 1948), member of the Canadian parliament", "*John McKay (New Brunswick politician) (born 1948), former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick and mayor of Miramichi, New Brunswick", "*John McKay (Northern Ireland politician) (born 1945), member of the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention", "* John McKay, co-founder of the Gaelic Athletic Association", "*John McKay (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "*John McKay (1950s footballer), Scottish football player", "*John McKay (American football) (1923\u20132001), American football coach", "*John McKay Jr. (born 1953), American football wide receiver"]}, {"page": "John McKay (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John McKay (British politician)"]}]}}
