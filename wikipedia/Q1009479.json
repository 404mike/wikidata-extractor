It won consecutive League championships in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946\u201347 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham Utd centre half George Kay. Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal. The club was relegated to the Second Division in the 1953\u201354 season. Soon after Liverpool lost 2\u20131 to non-league Worcester City in the 1958\u201359 FA Cup, Bill Shankly was appointed manager. Upon his arrival he released 24\u00a0players and converted a boot storage room at Anfield into a room where the coaches could discuss strategy; here, Shankly and other \"Boot Room\" members Joe Fagan, Reuben Bennett, and Bob Paisley began reshaping the team."]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["|  George Kay"]}, {"page": "Matt Busby", "response": ["During the Second World War, Busby served as a football coach in the Army Physical Training Corps, and the experience resulted in Liverpool offering him the job of assistant to their then-manager George Kay. However, the experience had also forged Busby's opinions about how football should be played and governed, and when it became clear that they differed from those of the Liverpool board, their chairman Billy McConnell allowed Busby to pursue alternative employment."]}, {"page": "Cyril Sidlow", "response": ["Born in Colwyn Bay, Conwy, North Wales, Sidlow played for Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Wolverhampton Wanderers.  Signed by Wolves in 1937 by the great Major Frank Buckley Sidlow was the first choice Wolves keeper both before the war. The rise of England great Bert Williams at Wolves after the war limited his chances, this included a notable international match between England and Wales at Ninian Park where Wolves supplied both the England Keeper (Williams) and Welsh keeper (Sidlow). With Wolves having two international keepers this led to Sidlow being surplus to requirements, but a recognised international, Liverpool manager George Kay signed him for a then record \u00a34000 in February 1946. Sidlow made his debut for Liverpool on 31 August 1946 in a league match at Bramall Lane, and kept his first clean sheet for the club, with Len Carney scoring a late goal for the Reds in the 90th minute."]}, {"page": "Bob Paisley", "response": ["Paisley played for \"the Bishops\" for two seasons until he was signed by Liverpool in May 1939, a few months after his twentieth birthday. The Bishops were one of the top non-league teams in England and Paisley called them \"the Kings of Amateur Football\". In Paisley's second season with them, they achieved a treble by winning the Northern League championship, the FA Amateur Cup and the Durham County Challenge Cup. The FA Amateur Cup final was played in Durham at Roker Park where the Bishops defeated Willington 3\u20130 after extra time. During the season, Paisley was approached by Liverpool manager George Kay and promised that he would sign for Liverpool at the end of the season. He kept his promise even though Sunderland reconsidered and made another approach.", "At the end of August 1941, on the bank holiday, Paisley was posted overseas and did not return to England until 1945. He went in a troopship to Egypt, the voyage lasting ten weeks because they had to sail around South Africa. He spent Christmas in Egypt and then received his first mail from England which turned out to be a postcard from George Kay asking him if he would be available to play for Liverpool against Preston North End (Bill Shankly's team) in the season opener three months earlier.Liversedge, p. 13. While he was in Egypt, Paisley became interested in horse racing through friendship with jockey Reg Stretton and trainer Frank Carr. Paisley learned to ride himself and he retained this interest after the war, often studying form in his spare moments.Liversedge, p. 14."]}, {"page": "Joe Fagan", "response": ["After leaving school in 1937, Fagan signed for the St Helens-based Earlestown Bohemians club, known as the \"Bohs\", who played in the Liverpool County Combination. This was a strong amateur league in which the \"A\" teams of both Everton and Liverpool competed.Andrew Fagan via Google Books (book on order) Liverpool became interested and he was invited to Anfield for a trial. Manager George Kay offered him a contract but Fagan, then aged seventeen, declined as he thought his first team opportunities at Liverpool would be limited. On 8 October 1938, he signed for Manchester City. Throughout Fagan's playing career, he was a right half, though he could also play at centre half.The position of wing half is now obsolete in football terminology but it was a key role at the time of Fagan's career when teams routinely played in a 2\u20133\u20135 formation. The wing halves (right and left) played outside the centre half in the middle three. Although some wing halves were more creative than defensive, Fagan's job was to win the ball and move it forward, so he was the equivalent of what is called a holding midfielder in 21st century football. In the 1938\u201339 season, Fagan made good progress at City playing for the club's \"A\" and \"B\" teams and then getting into the reserves. He was challenging for a first-team place when the Second World War began just as the 1939\u201340 season was getting under way and the Football League was suspended for the duration of the conflict.Fagan & Platt, p. 13."]}, {"page": "Ted Drake", "response": ["Born in Southampton, Drake started playing at Winchester City, whilst continuing to work as a gas-meter reader. He nearly joined Spurs as a schoolboy, but missed the trial match with an injury. In June 1931, he was persuaded by George Kay to join Southampton, then playing in Division Two. He made his Saints debut on 14 November 1931 at Swansea Town, and signed as a professional in November, becoming first-choice centre-forward by the end of the 1931\u201332 season."]}, {"page": "Belfast Celtic F.C.", "response": ["*  George Kay"]}]}}
