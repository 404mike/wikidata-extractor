In September 2005, Evans and four other people connected with Boston appeared in court, denying fraud charges. In November 2005, Evans was given a \u00a31,000 fine, suspended for a year, after admitting to using insulting or abusive words to the match official in a match against Peterborough United in October 2005. On 11 February 2006, he was escorted from Grimsby Town's stadium Blundell Park by Humberside Police at half-time, after he berated the fourth official after being incensed when Grimsby goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall appeared to handle the ball outside his area and was immediately spoken to by a police officer after a complaint of alleged foul and abusive language. After the match Boston chairman Jon Sotnick accused the football authorities of waging a \"conspiracy\" against his manager. In October 2006, Evans was linked with the vacant Darlington managerial vacancy, but Boston chairman James Rodwell and Evans both denied the link. Also in October, Evans was sent from the dugout after an altercation with Wycombe Wanderers player Tommy Doherty for which he later received a \u00a31,000 suspended fine from the FA. Despite this, which came on top of his conviction for tax evasion, Evans kept his manager's position at Boston, a decision that angered the Boston United Supporters' Trust."]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland national football B team", "response": ["*Tommy Doherty "]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Tommy DohertyDoherty was born in Bristol, England, but also qualified to represent Northern Ireland internationally through his grandfather and represented the Northern Ireland B team before making his international debut for Northern Ireland in June 2003."]}, {"page": "Thomas Edward Doherty", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Doherty"]}, {"page": "Thomas E.
