The revived Georgian style that emerged in Britain during the same period is usually referred to as Neo-Georgian; the work of Edwin Lutyens and Vincent Harris includes some examples. The British town of Welwyn Garden City, established in the 1920s, is an example of pastiche or Neo-Georgian development of the early 20th century in Britain. Versions of the Neo-Georgian style were commonly used in Britain for certain types of urban architecture until the late 1950s, Bradshaw Gass & Hope's Police Headquarters in Salford of 1958 being a good example. Architects such as Raymond Erith, and Donald McMorran were among the few architects who continued the neo-Georgian style into the 1960s. Both in the United States and Britain, the Georgian style is still employed by architects like Quinlan Terry, Julian Bicknell, Ben Pentreath, Robert Adam Architects, and Fairfax and Sammons for private residences. A debased form in commercial housing developments, especially in the suburbs, is known in the UK as mock-Georgian."]}, {"page": "1986 in architecture", "response": ["* Henbury Hall, Cheshire, England, designed by Julian Bicknell after Palladio as depicted by Felix Kelly."]}, {"page": "Stephen Bicknell", "response": ["In 1986, he collaborated with his architect brother Julian Bicknell on the casework of the organ at Magdalen College, Oxford.

The outside appearance was fine, but the woodwork and pipes were \"broken, dented and collapsing\". The organ was eventually overhauled and restored in 2002.

He demolished the existing house and commissioned the architect Harry Fairhurst to convert the stable block for his own residential use.  After the death of Sir Vincent in 1980, his son Sebastian and the designer Felix Kelly, who had already been involved with some work on the Henbury estate, came up with the idea of creating a house in the style of a Palladian temple.  Kelly executed an oil painting based on Villa Rotonda, a house near Vicenza built in 1552 and designed by Andrea Palladio. Sebastian then commissioned the architect Julian Bicknell to create a design similar to Kelly's painting.  The new building was completed in 1986. Sebastian lived there with his wife Naomi, until her death in 2003. Together, they designed the interior with the help of David Milnaric.  They also worked together on the gardens. He was married again briefly before his death on 15 October 2015. In 2018 the house and estate was put on the market for an undisclosed sum.
