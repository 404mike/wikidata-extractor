In 1903 he was the Bury captain and made a significant contribution to their victory, scoring the first goal in their record 6\u20130 win over Derby County.

Derby's keeper Jack Fryer played despite an existing injury which he aggravated early in the second half when he was trying to prevent Charlie Sagar from scoring Bury's second goal. As a result, Fryer was forced to leave the field and, as substitutes were not allowed then, one of the full-backs deputised in goal and their team was down to ten men for most of the last forty minutes. Bury scored three goals in four minutes just before the hour was up and their sixth after 76 minutes. Joe Leeming scored the third and last goals. Willie Wood and Jack Plant scored the other two. The final was a no contest and Derby were lambasted by the press for their poor performance. One reporter commented that, but for being merciful, Bury should have scored twenty. Bury's 6\u20130 win established an FA Cup final record for the biggest winning margin. Bury remained sole holders of the record until the 2019 final in which Manchester City defeated Watford by the same score. The ball used in the 1903 final is on display at the National Football Museum."]}, {"page": "George Ross", "response": ["George Ross may refer to:", "* George Ross (American politician) (1730\u20131779), signatory to the U.S. Declaration of Independence", "* George Ross (Pennsylvania candidate), candidate for U.S. House of Representatives in 1884 and 1888 and U.S. Senate in 1893", "* George Ross (Pennsylvania statesman) (1746\u20131801), Lt.

From the start, the Bury forwards directed high crosses into the goalmouth to test the Southampton goalkeeper, Jack Robinson. Although Southampton kept things even at first, their first mistake was by Peter Durber who allowed Richards to force a corner. This was taken by Plant whose cross was converted by McLuckie into the first goal, scored after nine minutes of play.

Bury's six-goal victory remains the record winning margin in FA Cup finals, though it was equalled in the 2019 final when Manchester City defeated Watford by the same score.

Bloomer declared himself unfit but Fryer refused to stand aside for his understudy, Frank Davies, who had never played at senior level. Despite their problems, Derby began the match as favourites given their league form to the end of March, although they were now out of title contention. Bury had no team problems and could field their full first-choice eleven, including six players who had won the cup three years earlier: Joe Leeming, Plant, Richards, George Ross, Sagar and Willie Wood.", "The weather was dry but the pitch was described as hard and uneven. The pitch seems to have helped Bury take the lead after twenty minutes when their captain George Ross aimed a lofted shot goalwards and the ball bounced awkwardly to deceive Jack Fryer before looping over his head. If Fryer had been fully fit, he would probably have saved the goal.", "|LH || George Ross (c)", "Afterwards, the trophy was presented to Bury captain George Ross by Lord Kinnaird who was himself a famous footballer, having played in a record nine FA Cup finals from 1873 to 1883.
