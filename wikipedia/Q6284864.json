As early as July 1934, however, in a letter to Lucy Brereton, he was distinguishing himself from \"[t]he poor old Samuel Liberals\" and their \"frightful position\";Diaries and Letters p. 147 yet in December of the same year, writing to Lucy once more, he referred to the official Liberals as \"we\" and called Samuel his \"leader\";Diaries and Letters, p. 167 while in March 1935 he told his sister that he was \"very seriously thinking\" of \"asking for the government whip\".Diaries and Letters, p. 186 In short, he agonised about his party affiliation for some time.

It may also have been connected with the tragic death of his mother Lillian, who, after a long period of depressive illness and voluntary residence in nursing homes, was found dead in the River Thames just before Christmas 1935.  Bernays' sense that he needed to recover his psychological equilibrium and rebuild his career after his mother's death and the publicity it provoked is evident in his diary entries from early 1936.Diaries and Letters, p. 237 (A coroner's inquest recorded an open verdict on Mrs Bernays, but suicide must have been suspected, at a time when the stigma attached to it could still be seriously damaging to any relative of the victim who was a public figure in Britain.)
