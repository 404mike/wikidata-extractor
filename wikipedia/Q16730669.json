Her modest-sized, figurative paintings make use of figurative imagery relating to modernism, domesticity, longing, and utopian counter-cultural movements. Stacy Martin describes her most recent show as embodying a \"fascination with heroines and literary inspiration [which] runs throughout all her projects along with her subtle nods to romanticism making for a collection that is more 'poetic than narrative' in effect.\"Donachie shows at Peres Projects in Berlin and Maureen Paley in London.\nHer work has been reviewed in Frieze  and Artforum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Metamodernism", "response": ["Vermeulen asserted that \"metamodernism is not so much a philosophy\u2014which implies a closed ontology\u2014as it is an attempt at a vernacular, or...a sort of open source document, that might contextualise and explain what is going on around us, in political economy as much as in the arts.\" The return of a Romantic sensibility has been posited as a key characteristic of metamodernism, observed by Vermeulen and van den Akker in the architecture of Herzog & de Meuron, and the work of artists such as Bas Jan Ader, Peter Doig, Olafur Eliasson, Kaye Donachie, Charles Avery, and Ragnar Kjartansson."]}, {"page": "List of painters in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art collections", "response": ["*Kaye Donachie (b.1970), 1 painting : LACMA"]}, {"page": "Donachie", "response": ["* Kaye Donachie (born 1970), British painter"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish women artists", "response": ["*Kaye Donachie (born 1970), painter"]}]}}
