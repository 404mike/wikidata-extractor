Yeovil's squad included nine trialists, goals from Otis Khan and Bevis Mugabi earned the Glovers a 2\u20131 victory after former Yeovil striker Brandon Goodship had given Weymouth the lead. On 14 July, Yeovil completed their seventh signing of the season with young defender Keston Davies joining on loan until the end of the season from Swansea City. Davies made his first appearance the following day in Yeovil's first home friendly against Championship club Bristol City, on 15 July. Three goals in six first half minutes saw Yeovil succumb to a 3\u20131 defeat with Olomola scoring a consolation goal. Yeovil then traveled to South Wales for a short training camp, where on 19 July they faced Welsh Football League Division One club Llanelli Town, and recorded a 2\u20130 victory over their Welsh opponents with goals from Khan and Fran\u00e7ois Zoko. On 22 July, Yeovil faced local side Frome Town in a friendly organised as a benefit match for local semi-professional footballer Jamie Mines, who suffered serious injuries following an electrical shock at work. Despite falling behind to their Southern League opponents goals from Nathan Smith and Rhys Browne earned Yeovil a fourth victory of pre-season. After a successful trial Yeovil confirmed the signing of Brazilian former Derby County midfielder Alefe Santos on a two-year contract. Yeovil then entertained League One club Bristol Rovers and suffered their second 3\u20131 defeat of pre-season with Nathan Smith scoring the Glovers only goal. On 28 July, Yeovil confirmed their ninth signing of pre-season with former Swansea City right back Daniel Alfei signing a two-year contract following a successful trial.

Yeovil completed their pre-season schedule with a 3\u20131 defeat against Premier League side Bournemouth, with Swansea loanee Keston Davies scoring for the Glovers. Following the Bournemouth match, summer signing James Bailey was announced as Yeovil's new captain for the 2017\u201318 season replacing the released Darren Ward. Prior to the first competitive game of the season, Yeovil completed the signing of Sam Surridge on loan from Bournemouth until the end of the season.", "On 1 December, Yeovil confirmed the signing of midfielder Oscar Gobern on non-contract terms until the end of the season. Yeovil began December with a FA Cup second round tie against fellow League Two side Port Vale, the game ended 1\u20131 after a late header from substitute Jordan Green earned Yeovil a replay. The Glovers then faced League One side AFC Wimbledon in the second round of the EFL Trophy, first goals for the club from Keston Davies and Jake Gray secured Yeovil a comfortable 2\u20130 victory and progression into the third round. On 8 December, youth team defender Jeremiah Gyebi joined National League South side Poole Town on an initial month's loan deal. Yeovil's first league match of the month saw them succumb to a third home defeat of the season losing 2\u20130 to Lincoln City. On 12 December, Yeovil hosted Port Vale in their FA Cup second round replay, the two sides finished regular time with another 1\u20131 draw, with Otis Khan scoring a penalty in the first half, before a late equaliser for Port Vale, who had two men sent off. Khan scored a second in extra time, but after Port Vale equalised again, Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scored the game's winner a minute later to send Yeovil through to the third round.", "Yeovil started the new year with a home fixture against Crawley Town, despite taking the lead through Sam Surridge the Glovers lost the match 2\u20131 having been reduced to nine men with both Connor Smith and Omar Sowunmi being sent off. The first week of the January transfer window saw a high turnover of players with the loans of Sid Nelson, Olufela Olomola and Matt Worthington expiring while the loan of Keston Davies was terminated after he had failed to break into the Yeovil side. The four loans were replaced with Liverpool defender Corey Whelan, Barnsley midfielder Jared Bird, Middlesbrough attacking midfielder Lewis Wing and Southampton striker Marcus Barnes all joining the club on loan until the end of the season from their respective clubs. On 6 January, Yeovil faced League One side Bradford City in the third round of the FA Cup. Despite being the lowest ranked team left in the competition, Yeovil won the match 2\u20130 with a goal from Marcus Barnes on his debut and a third of the season from Jordan Green enough to see Yeovil through to the fourth round for only the fourth time in their history. Yeovil then faced Forest Green Rovers in the third round of the EFL Trophy, and secured back-to-back 2\u20130 wins with goals from Nathan and Connor Smith enough to secure qualification to the quarter-finals of the competition. Having established himself in the Yeovil team, attacker Jordan Green was rewarded with a new contract until the summer of 2019, while defender Tom James also signed an improved contract. On 13 January, Yeovil drew 1\u20131 away at relegation rivals Port Vale, with Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scoring his tenth goal of the season to give the Glovers the lead but they conceded in the final five minutes to drop two points. The following week saw the club confirm that they had received a \"substantial bid\" for winger Otis Khan which had met a release clause in his contract, and that there had also been interest in defender Omar Sowunmi. On 20 January, Yeovil faced Chesterfield in a relegation six-pointer, after falling behind against the run of play Lewis Wing equalised with a 25-yard looping shot, his first goal for the club. In the final minute of injury time after Otis Khan appeared to have his shirt pulled he stopped playing allowing Chestefield to go up the other end to score a late winner with Khan then being sent off for shoving referee Kevin Johnson. Yeovil appealed the decision to send the midfielder off, but the appeal was deemed frivolous and Khan's ban was subsequently extended to five matches."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Swansea City A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 14 July 2017 || CB ||  || Keston Davies || Yeovil Town ||3 January 2018|| "]}, {"page": "Keston Ellis Davies", "response": ["#REDIRECT Keston Davies"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Swansea City A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2018 || DF ||  || Keston Davies || Notts County || 3 January 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["|21||Keston Davies||CB||||Swansea||||1||0||Swansea||31 August 2018||Free||Undisclosed", "|21||||CB||Keston Davies        ||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1", "| 31 August 2018 || CB ||  || Keston Davies ||  Swansea City || 3 January 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Swansea City A.F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2019 || CB ||  || Keston Davies || colspan=\"2\"|Released || "]}]}}
