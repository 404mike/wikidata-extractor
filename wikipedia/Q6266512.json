Beer worked with Paul Downes as a duo from 1974 and also in the Arizona Smoke Revue 1980. He was a key member of Johnny Coppin's band (ex-Decameron), and together they collaborated with Nigel Mazlyn Jones on his 1979 Sentinel album. He toured with Mike Oldfield in 1979 and also recorded some tracks at Oldfield's Througham studio.  Beer joined The Albion Band in 1984 and stayed with them until 1991, touring extensively at home and abroad, and recording many albums. Show of Hands became a full-time partnership from 1991. Beer continues to do session work, most notably on The Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels album, Steve Harley's Poetic Justice and countless other mainstream and less high-profile projects.

In 1976 the vocal group BMW (Bower, Morrison & Woollard) invited Bill (together with Tim & Howard) to record some tracks during their sessions at Sun Studios in Reading. The songs recorded were Ballad of Charlie Daniels, The Worm Forgives the Plough, Bless These Children and The River Waits for No Man (Roll on River).
