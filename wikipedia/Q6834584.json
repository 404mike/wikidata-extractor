Filsell notes that the work grew from five years of research by Garth, who combined \"his twin great interests\" \u2013 in Tolkien and the war. He suspects that many readers will find that parts 1 and 3 \"inform them too well\" about the development of Tolkien's poetry and mythology; but in his view Garth's account of Tolkien's \"service as a regimental signals officer during the battles of the Somme, is especially well realised\". He notes Garth's acknowledged debt to the histories of Michael Stedman, Alf Peacock and Paul Reed. He praises Garth's accounts, too, of Tolkien's three close friends."]}]}}
