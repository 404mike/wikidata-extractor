He made seven appearances at Old Trafford, winning the Intercontinental Cup, as well as having a loan spell with Belgian side Royal Antwerp before joining Derby County in order to play more matches. He spent three years at Derby but handed in a transfer request when the club was relegated from the Premier League. Southampton signed Higginbotham for a \u00a31.5 million fee in February 2003, and he helped them reach the 2003 FA Cup Final. When Southampton were relegated in 2005, Higginbotham rejected a new contract and was placed on the transfer list.\nHe joined fellow Championship side Stoke City for a \u00a3225,000 fee in August 2006. He was made captain when Michael Duberry left in January 2007 and Stoke went on to narrowly miss out on a play-off place. With Stoke not being promoted Higginbotham again decided to hand in a transfer request to help force through a move to Sunderland. He spent one season at the Stadium of Light before returning to Stoke in 2008. He became a vital member of Tony Pulis' squad as Stoke established themselves in the Premier League. He scored the winning goal in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham United but missed out on both the semi-final and the final due to a knee injury. After his recovery he struggled to force his way back into the side and spent time out on loan to Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town before joining Sheffield United on a free transfer in January 2013. After eight months at Bramall Lane, he left to join Conference Premier side Chester before ending his career with a short spell at Altrincham.\nHigginbotham made his international debut for the Gibraltar national team in a friendly against Slovakia in November 2013 at the age of 34, qualifying through his maternal grandmother. In January 2014, Higginbotham retired from club football after a 14-year career, but made two more international appearances for Gibraltar until his international retirement in March.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 29", "response": ["*  1978   \u2013 Danny Higginbotham, English footballer and journalist"]}, {"page": "Roy Keane", "response": ["The lowest point of their next season came at Goodison Park, where they were beaten 7\u20131 by Everton, which Keane described as \"one of the lowest points\" of his career. In the second half of the season, however, the team's form was much improved (especially at home) and survival in the division was guaranteed with two games to go with a home win against Middlesbrough. Meanwhile, Keane carried on his trend of buying ex-Manchester United players with the addition of Kieran Richardson, Paul McShane, Danny Higginbotham and Phil Bardsley. He has also continued his strict disciplinary policy by putting Liam Miller (one of Sunderland's more consistent players) on the transfer list for being regularly late for training and other team meetings."]}, {"page": "Talksport", "response": ["* June 2016: Talksport and Talksport 2 broadcast Euro 2016, with commentary of all 51 matches.

Following West Ham's equaliser, Fuller argued with team-mate Andy Griffin, before slapping the Stoke captain's face. Referee Mike Jones gave Fuller a straight red for violent conduct and West Ham went on to win the match 2\u20131. Tony Pulis and Stoke teammate Danny Higginbotham commented that the incident would not affect the club. On 1 January 2009, Tony Pulis confirmed that Fuller and Griffin had \"kissed and made up\" after a team meeting. Fuller said Griffin had been \"very rude and disrespectful\", but accepted that his actions had been worse. In a match against Sunderland in February 2009 Fuller dislocated his shoulder and it was feared that he would be out injured for the rest of the season. However Fuller made a quick recover and was out for just two weeks.

His most notable coup was the loan signing of Lee Hendrie from Aston Villa. Hendrie's arrival along with the loan signings of Salif Diao, Andy Griffin and Rory Delap coincided with a change of form for the Potters following a poor start to the season. Stoke went as high as fourth in the table prior to the January transfer window.", "Pulis was named Manager of the Month for April 2007 after Stoke picked up 11 points from 5 league games. This unbeaten run lifted Stoke to seventh in the table, on equal points with sixth-place Southampton.

Pulis sold several key players prior to the 2007\u201308 season; club captain Danny Higginbotham was one of a number of players to depart, joining Sunderland for \u00a33\u00a0million. Pulis, however, utilised the loan market again, signing five players on loan, including Ryan Shawcross from Manchester United, with a few of these loan signings joining on a permanent deal in the January transfer window.", "Pulis guided Stoke City to promotion to the Premier League on the final matchday of the season, to be Stoke's first top flight campaign in 23 years. Upon promotion, Pulis admitted the need to strengthen his squad but he also made it clear that the club would not go 'over the top' with spending. Stoke's biggest summer signing was that of striker Dave Kitson, who joined from recently relegated Reading for \u00a35.5\u00a0million. Kitson was followed by the captures of Seyi Olofinjana from Wolverhampton Wanderers for \u00a33\u00a0million, Abdoulaye Faye from Newcastle United for \u00a32.25\u00a0million, Amdy Faye from Charlton Athletic for an undisclosed fee, Andrew Davies joined for \u00a31.2\u00a0million from Southampton, defender Ibrahima Sonko signed for an initial \u00a32\u00a0million fee from Reading and former Potter Danny Higginbotham rejoined his former club from Sunderland for an undisclosed fee.

Despite the criticism, Manager Peter Grant praised Ashdown, saying: \"Jamie put both hands up and said it's the worst he's played in two years in the two games.

Later that season, Wallwork was loaned out twice: firstly to Carlisle United, where he scored his first goal in professional football, and then to Stockport County. He joined Royal Antwerp on loan during the following season and helped them to reach the play-offs, but their hopes of promotion to the First Division were ended by a defeat to La Louvi\u00e8re. After the match, Wallwork grabbed referee Amand Ancion by the throat, for which he was banned from football for life. Another Manchester United loanee, Danny Higginbotham, was banned for a year for his part in the attack. A Belgian court reduced Wallwork's sentence to a three-year suspension, of which two years were probational, while Higginbotham's ban was reduced to four months.
