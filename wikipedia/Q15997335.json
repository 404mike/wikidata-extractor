He made his first 50 runs in 105 minutes, but then raced to 216 in 250 minutes, scoring two fives and 37 fours and putting on 262 for the sixth wicket with Gustavus Fowke, which remained the Leicestershire record for this wicket until beaten by Phil Simmons and Paul Nixon in 1996. Despite this achievement, Wisden noted that \"in fourteen more attempts he scored only about 150 runs, so that his one big performance must be taken as promise rather than a proof of first-rate ability\". That analysis proved correct: in 30 further matches in the three seasons up the First World War Sharp passed 50 only twice and did not score another century."]}]}}
