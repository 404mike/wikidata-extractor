NDP representation in the House of Assembly grew slowly in throughout the 1970s, but never rose above four seats.

However, the party failed to win any seats on the mainland, and this exacerbated tensions between the Akerman-dominated Cape Breton wing of the party and the university-based party establishment in Halifax.Canadian Press, \"Void facing N.S.
