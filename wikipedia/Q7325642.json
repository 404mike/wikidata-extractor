In 1860 he was elected the Member of Parliament for Berkshire, a position he held until his resignation in 1876. He was a patron of the Anti-Mendacity Society, the National Society for School Furniture and the Society for the Augmentation of Small Livings.\nBy his wife Elizabeth Mary Clutterbuck he had three daughters, and upon his death in 1897, his estates were inherited by his nephew, James Herbert Benyon.
