A long-time supporter of Wealdstone F.C., he gained attention due to a humorous viral video of him heckling opposing supporters of Whitehawk F.C. at a football match in March 2013, which ultimately ended in a 1\u20131 draw, with phrases such as \"You want some? I'll give it ya\" and \"You've got no fans\". However, the video did not reach its peak in popularity until December 2014.\nAn online article by BBC News included The Wealdstone Raider in the 'top memes and viral videos' of December 2014. The nickname \"Wealdstone Raider\" came from the title of the original video uploaded by YouTube user dazman21. Coincidentally, Hill claimed his brother had the nickname of \"Raider\" ten years prior to the upload.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wealdstone", "response": ["*Gordon Hill/The Wealdstone Raider, internet personality"]}, {"page": "Wealdstone F.C.", "response": ["*The Wealdstone Raider"]}, {"page": "Charity record", "response": ["|The Wealdstone Raider"]}, {"page": "List of music videos set in London", "response": ["|The Wealdstone Raider"]}, {"page": "Gordon Hill", "response": ["* The Wealdstone Raider (born 1966), real name Gordon Hill, an English Internet celebrity"]}, {"page": "Wealdstone Raider", "response": ["#REDIRECT The Wealdstone Raider"]}, {"page": "Got No Fans", "response": ["\"Got No Fans\" is a song by British Internet celebrity The Wealdstone Raider (real name Gordon Hill).
