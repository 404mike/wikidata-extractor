The unique tonal range comes from photogravure's variable depth of etch, that is, the shadows are etched many times deeper than the highlights. Unlike half-tone processes which vary the size of dot, the depth of ink wells is varied in a photogravure plate. The human eye resolves these fine variations into a continuous tone image. Photogravure practitioners such as Peter Henry Emerson and others brought the art to a high standard in the late 19th century. This continued with the work of Alfred Stieglitz in the early 20th century, especially in relation to his publication Camera Work."]}, {"page": "Sagua La Grande", "response": ["* Peter Henry Emerson, photographer"]}, {"page": "Cranleigh School", "response": ["* Peter Henry Emerson (photographer)"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the University of London", "response": ["* Peter Henry Emerson (KCL)"]}, {"page": "Royal Photographic Society", "response": ["*1895 \u2013  Peter Henry Emerson"]}, {"page": "George Davison (photographer)", "response": ["He began to make photographs in 1885, and he joined the Camera Club photography society around that time.
