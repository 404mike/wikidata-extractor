Phillips and Rutherford decided to make music their full-time career, for they were starting to write more complex music than their earlier songs with King. After Banks and Gabriel decided to follow suit, the four returned to Regent Sound in August 1969 and recorded four more demos with Silver: \"Family\" (later known as \"Dusk\"), \"White Mountain\", \"Going Out to Get You\", and \"Pacidy\".
