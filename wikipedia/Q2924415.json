Mathieson, ed., Celtic music (San Francisco CA: Backbeat Books, 2001) pp. 88\u201395. From the late Middle Ages the fiddle (crowd in Cornish), bombarde (horn-pipe), bagpipes and harp all seem to have been used in music. The Cornish bagpipes died out, as elsewhere in southern England, in the 16th century, but have recently been re-created.H. Woodhouse, Cornish Bagpipes: Fact or Fiction? (Truro: Truran, 1994). From the mid-19th century accordions became progressively more popular as a folk instrument in the county, as in the rest of the West Country. There is long and varied history of Cornish dance from the medieval period, with records of strong traditions of morris dancing, mumming, guise dancing, and social dance.R. Hays, C. McGee, S. Joyce & E. Newlyn, eds., Records of Early English Drama, Dorset & Cornwall (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999). These seem to have been interrupted by the Reformation and Civil War and Commonwealth in the 16th and 17th centuries.M. J. O'Connor, Ilow Kernow 3 (St. Ervan, Lyngham House, 2005). However, there was revival from the late 18th century and seasonal and community festivals, mumming and guising all flourished.M. J. O'Connor, '\u2019An Overview of Recent Discoveries in Cornish Music,' Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall (2007). In the 19th century a strong tradition of nonconformity and temperance may also have affected dancing and music adversely and encouraged choral and brass band movements, while traditional tunes were used for carols. Some community events survived, such as the 'Obby 'Oss festival in Padstow and the Furry Dance in Helston. Folk songs include \u2018Sweet Nightingale\u2019, \u2018Little Eyes\u2019, and \u2018Lamorna\u2019. 'Trelawny' is often sung at sporting events and is seen by many as an unofficial anthem.H. F. Tucker, Epic: Britain's Heroic Muse 1790\u20131910 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 452. Few traditional Cornish lyrics survived the decline of the language, but in some cases lyrics of common English songs became attached to older Cornish tunes.P. B. Ellis, The Cornish Language and Its Literature: A History (Routledge, 1974), pp. 92\u20134, 186 and 212. Some folk tunes have Cornish lyrics written since the language revival of the 1920s. Modern Cornish musicians include the former Cornish folk singer Brenda Wootton and the Cornish-Breton family band Anao Atao. Recently bands like Sacred Turf, Skwardya and Krena, have begun performing British folk rock in the Cornish language.D. Harvey, Celtic Geographies: Old Culture, New Times (London: Routledge, 2002), pp. 223\u20134.
