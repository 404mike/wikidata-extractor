In her early years, Stenson played her as a flirt, who acted out for the attention of boys. Her first lovers included Christian virgin Brian Drake (Jonathan Le Billon) and football playing \"lothario\" Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde). Her later relationship with Cameron Clark (Ben Gerrard) had \"ups and downs\" due to his obsessive-compulsive disorder. To boost his confidence she forced him to join a rock band. Her actions were successful, and Stenson said Steph was \"proud\" of this. She sacrificed their relationship so Cameron could leave and tour Europe.
