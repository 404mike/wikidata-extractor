York were unwilling to release him from his contract for less than \u00a320,000 compensation, and Sunderland would only go as far as pay \u00a310,000. Smith agreed to a \u00a340,000-a-year contract that meant if he failed to win promotion with Sunderland in his first season he would pay the extra \u00a310,000 compensation himself. He brought his York coaching staff with him: Viv Busby, Malcolm Crosby, and Roger Jones. He also signed former York player John MacPhail to shore up the defence, who captained the team and scored 16 goals (including 10 penalties) in his maiden season at Roker Park. He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for \u00a380,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987\u201388. A 7\u20130 win over Southend United started a run of 15 league matches unbeaten, though in the second half of the campaign a run of just 2 wins in 10 matches set them back. Smith bought Swansea City winger Colin Pascoe in March 1988, and oversaw a run of seven wins in the final eight matches to secure the Third Division championship and promotion with 93 points."]}, {"page": "Hong Kong First Division League", "response": ["* Iain Hesford (Longest Clean Sheets)"]}, {"page": "2014 in association football", "response": ["* 18 November: Iain Hesford, English footballer (born 1960)"]}, {"page": "1993 Guangdong\u2013Hong Kong Cup", "response": ["*  Iain Hesford \u5e0c\u798f\u7279"]}, {"page": "Ian Hesford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Iain Hesford"]}, {"page": "Hong Kong Top Footballer Awards", "response": ["|Iain Hesford"]}, {"page": "Peter Swan (footballer, born 1966)", "response": ["New manager Colin Appleton used Swan in all four playing position within the first fourteen days of the 1989\u201390 campaign; his time in goal came when goalkeeper Iain Hesford was injured in a defeat to AFC Bournemouth and had to leave the field at half-time. Appleton failed to control his players, and with his team bottom of the division, he was sacked in October \u2013 much to the amusement of Swan and the team. His replacement Stan Ternent managed to instil the discipline necessary to get the best performances out of Swan and the other 'big characters' at the club. Ternent dragged Swan off just fifteen minutes into his first match as manager, but calmed the fury of his player when he explained the change was a tactical one. Ternent then put Swan up front with Andy Payton, and the pair put in a 28-goal haul in the league between them \u2013 with Swan claiming eleven of these despite missing fifteen games with anterior cruciate ligament damage in his knee. Following his recovery Swan played in defence, and the \"Tigers\" managed to save their second tier status and finish in mid-table."]}, {"page": "Premier League All Stars", "response": ["Goalkeeper - Iain Hesford "]}, {"page": "History of Blackpool F.C.

His assistant Clive Walker (not to be confused with the former Chelsea player) took over, and managed to keep the Stones off the foot of the table. Walker's managerial skills, combined with the efforts of the few capable players left at the club (notably a young Gary Breen, goalkeeper Iain Hesford, defender Bradley Sandeman and winger Liburd Henry) saw them through, although debts remained huge and the threat of being forced out of the Football League remained."]}]}}
