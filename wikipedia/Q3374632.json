Much of the colony had been conquered several months before the war ended, in the big British offensive of summer 1945. That gave ACSEA crucial breathing space to start getting the colony back on its feet before the massive increase in occupation duties postwar occurred. RAF Burma was well established under Air Marshal Sir Hugh Saunders. At the end of the war, it had 28 squadrons under its control. This quickly reduced as the demobilisation really kicked in. Again, the transport squadrons saw the largest amount of work, evacuating POWs and internees and supplying garrisons and the civilian population. Second to the transport squadrons in workload were the photo reconnaissance aircraft. The opportunity was taken to complete the process of surveying SE Asia from the air, and using the survey to bring maps up to date. The survey was not completed until August 1947. After the clean-up immediately postwar, came the task of preparing Burma for independence. AHQ Burma moved out of Rangoon to Mingaladon on 1 January 1947. The headquarters was disbanded on 31 December 1947, and three months later Burma became independent."]}, {"page": "Royal Danish Air Force", "response": ["To avoid further casualties the air force established a training squadron of two-seated T-33As in 1956 to train US-educated pilots to navigate under local weather conditions. Furthermore, Eskadrille 722 was changed to function as rescue squadron in 1956 and was strengthened by seven Sikorsky S-55 helicopters in 1957. Finally, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Saunders from Royal Air Force was employed in 1954 to reorganize the air force which led to the merger of Command East and West, forming Flyvertaktisk Kommando (Air Tactical Command) with the initial mission to lower the number of crashes during training."]}, {"page": "No. 84 Squadron RAF", "response": ["The squadron's aces during the First World War included Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor, Hugh Saunders and Walter A. Southey.", "* Hugh Saunders, World War I ace"]}, {"page": "Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor", "response": ["The break in his victory string lasted almost a month, as he went on home leave and helped a recruitment drive for the RAF. On 8 August, he returned and resumed with tally number 29, another balloon. On 9 August, Beauchamp-Proctor was leading No. 84 Squadron on a patrol over their base at Bertangles, with Boudwin and six-foot-four tall, fellow South African Hugh Saunders as wingmen. The threesome got involved in a heated engagement at 2:00 pm, that involved them in combat against Fokker D.VII fighters of JG I, led that day by the future Nazi Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring. Unsuccessful at increasing his total that day, Beauchamp-Proctor would claim an additional 14 aircraft, and end the month with his claims list extended to 43. One memorable day was 22 August; he attacked a line of six enemy balloon over the British 3rd Corps front. He set the first one afire with his machine guns and forced the other five to the ground, the observers taking to their parachutes. His 15 victories for August would include five balloons, all destroyed, and two more two-seater planes. He was now up to 43 victories."]}, {"page": "James Allen Ward", "response": ["Unbeknown to Ward, an official at the Air Ministry had suggested to the New Zealand government that he be returned to New Zealand. It was appreciated that Ward's profile as a result of the VC award would be useful for propaganda and recruitment purposes. He could also have served as an instructor with one of the home-based RNZAF squadrons. On 15 September 1941, the day of Ward's death, Group Captain Hugh Saunders, the Chief of Air Staff of the RNZAF, approved the proposal to return him to New Zealand."]}, {"page": "Roland Beamont", "response": ["Fighter Command had concerns about the Typhoon's safety and serviceability because during the first nine months of its introduction, the losses due to structural and engine failure were greater than caused by enemy action. As commanding officer of the few Typhoon squadrons, Beamont was instrumental in arguing for keeping the aircraft in RAF service against increasing establishment resistance. He was called to meetings with Air Chief Marshall Trafford Leigh Mallory and AOC Hugh Saunders to discuss the future of the Typhoon. Beamont argued that he had faith in the manufacturers to correct its faults and that the basic design of the aircraft was sound: it was easy to fly, a stable firing platform, it was both faster and more manoeuvrable than contemporary Luftwaffe fighters. Leigh Mallory was in agreement and the Typhoon was saved. However, it was Beamont and his squadron's actions over the winter of 1942/43 that would start to establish the Typhoon's reputation.", "In mid-May 1943 he returned to Hawker's as a test pilot, performing experimental testing of both the Typhoon and new Tempest. In February 1944 AOC Hugh Saunders invited Beamont to form the first Tempest wing (No. 150), with the rank of acting wing commander. At this time the available Tempests were dispersed around maintenance units; Beamont had to fly between the units to locate them. By May 1944 his wing had become operational with two Tempest squadrons (No 3 and No 486) and one with Spitfire IX. Their first operations were ground attack sorties against trains or airfields. On D-Day+2 (8 June) the wing shot down three Bf 109s over the invasion beaches without loss, the first one credited to Beamont and the first to a Tempest."]}, {"page": "Johnny Checketts", "response": ["Checketts underwent an intensive debriefing to confirm his identity and to eliminate the possibility that he was a German spy before returning to No. 485 Squadron, which was now based at Hornchurch. He requested a return to operational duty but this was denied; he was advised by the commander of No. 11 Group, Air Vice Marshal Hugh Saunders, that he needed a less stressful role. Checketts was posted to the Central Gunnery School as an instructor, ending his tenure as commander of No. 485 Squadron."]}, {"page": "Balloon buster", "response": ["| Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "Air Member for Personnel", "response": ["*1 October 1947 Air Marshal Sir Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "Saunders", "response": ["* Hugh Saunders, South African Royal Air Force commander"]}, {"page": "Hugh William Lumsden Saunders", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "Operation Steinbock", "response": ["In late 1943, the RAF was reorganised and night fighter duties were made the responsibility of Fighter Command (Air Marshal Sir Roderic Hill) which in January 1944 had 10 and No. 11 Group RAF (Air Vice Marshals Charles Steele and Hugh Saunders) who were responsible for the defence of southern England and the Ground-controlled interception (GCI) operations in these areas."]}, {"page": "Sir Hugh William Lumsden Saunders", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh William Lumsden Saunders", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "Air Chief Marshal Hugh William Lumsden Saunders", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "Inspector-General of the RAF", "response": ["*30 September 1949 Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "List of eponymous roads in London", "response": ["| Hugh Dowding, Leslie Gossage, Keith Park, Charles Portal, Hugh Saunders and Arthur Tedder"]}, {"page": "List of World War I aces credited with 15\u201319 victories", "response": ["|Hugh Saunders"]}, {"page": "25th Aero Squadron", "response": ["On 10 November, the 25th Aero Squadron made its first flight over the lines, joining with the 4th Pursuit Group in a hunting expedition in front of Metz, with many of the 25th's S.E. 5as missing their \"overhead\" mount Lewis machine guns.

This patrol qualified the squadron as an aerial pursuit unit operating on the front.
