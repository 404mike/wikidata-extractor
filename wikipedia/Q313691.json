He led two resistance movements against the Government of Canada and its first prime minister, John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to defend M\u00e9tis rights and identity as the Northwest Territories came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence.\nThe first resistance movement led by Riel is now known as the Red River Rebellion of 1869\u20131870. The provisional government established by Riel ultimately negotiated the terms under which the new province of Manitoba entered the Canadian Confederation. Riel ordered the execution of Thomas Scott, and fled to the United States to escape prosecution. He was elected three times as member of the House of Commons, but, fearing for his life, he could never take his seat. During these years in exile he came to believe that he was a divinely chosen leader and prophet. He married in 1881 while in exile in the Montana Territory in the United States; he fathered three children.\nIn 1884 Riel was called upon by the M\u00e9tis leaders in Saskatchewan to help resolve longstanding rights grievances with the Canadian government, which led to armed conflict with government forces, the North-West Rebellion of 1885. Defeated at the Battle of Batoche, Riel was imprisoned in Regina where he was convicted at trial of high treason.  Despite protests, popular appeals and the jury's call for clemency, Riel was executed by hanging. Riel was seen as a heroic victim by French Canadians; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethno-religious lines. The M\u00e9tis were marginalized in the Prairie provinces by the increasingly English-dominated majority. An even more important long-term impact was the bitter alienation Francophones across Canada felt, and anger against the repression by their countrymen.Riel's historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous religious fanatic and rebel opposed to the Canadian nation, and, by contrast, as a charismatic leader intent on defending his M\u00e9tis people from the unfair encroachments by the federal government eager to give Orangemen-dominated Ontario settlers priority access to land.

The Conservatives returned to power until 1897."]}, {"page": "Indigenous peoples in Canada", "response": ["Amongst notable M\u00e9tis people are singer and actor Tom Jackson, Commissioner of the Northwest Territories Tony Whitford, and Louis Riel who led two resistance movements: the Red River Rebellion of 1869\u20131870 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885, which ended in his trial and subsequent execution."]}, {"page": "Red River Colony", "response": ["The proposal was met with a significant amount of resistance from the inhabitants of the Red River as they were given the chance to address their grievances about the potential loss of land and becoming part of an American colonization project through a proclamation by the Governor-General of the dominion. Americans who supported annexation by the U.S. government tried to depict themselves as favorable figures in the eyes of the M\u00e9tis by associating themselves with Louis Riel. The Rebellion was an unarmed conflict started by the M\u00e9tis because Canada was attempting to claim possession of Rupert's Land without any concern for the grievances of the M\u00e9tis. However, the main American intention behind their decision to support Riel and the Rebellion was an attempt to sway the M\u00e9tis in favour of the annexation by the US. One of their tools was the New Nation newspaper which elicited rhetoric that advocated annexation by the US because it embodied the popular Manifest Destiny ideology. This was meant to help the cause of annexation, the idea being that their support of the Red River Rebellion would encourage local resistance against the Canadian government, and help swing local opinion in favour of independence \u2013 then ultimately America would step in to offer the protection of the United States government to the Red River M\u00e9tis and assert themselves as the new leaders and Red River would become American land. They ultimately wanted to create a situation where the Red River could become American territory by allying with the discontented M\u00e9tis Nation.", "This political chaos, in a sense, became pivotal for Red River because it allowed for the success of the M\u00e9tis in their rebellion. The Canadian government were forced to develop the negotiations that allowed for the M\u00e9tis demands were legally entrenched in the Manitoba Act that eventually led to the creation of province of Manitoba.Flanagan, Thomas. \"Louis Riel and the Dispersion of American Metis pg. 179\" The political disputes put the M\u00e9tis on a platform to voice their disapproval of Americans ignoring their concerns over these land disputes. They had legitimate claims to the land and they stated that they were the \"descendants of the lords of the soil.\". Also, under Louis Riel's leadership, the Metis rebels were able to capture Fort Garry \u2013 a fortified post of the Hudson's Bay Company. This would lead Riel into becoming the leader of the provisional government, and he composed and sent a list of rights to Ottawa. The demands mainly consisted of the M\u00e9tis wanting Red River to be entered into Canadian confederation as a province, security for their land claims, making English and French the official languages of the colony, as well as financial support for the Red River population. Riel hoped to accomplish a sense of equality for the M\u00e9tis; he wanted to present them as a civilized people that were deserving of the same rights of any British subject. The rebellion became a pivotal moment in acquiring land rights and a political voice for the M\u00e9tis, who were constantly disregarded for their Aboriginal status.", "The aftermath of the rebellion caused the M\u00e9tis to no longer be considered as Canadian Aboriginals \u2013 they became regarded as their own social group, and were distinct from other Aboriginal groups. In order to pacify the M\u00e9tis resistance further, the Canadian government gave them generous land grants in 1869\u201370 that was carefully structured to be given in severalty, rather than in common.Flanagan, Thomas. \"Louis Riel and the Dispersion of American Metis.\" Pg. 184 Red River was now developing its own provincial government that had a political voice and political implications upon Canadian federal government. This rebellion also led to the M\u00e9tis emerging as a unique, acknowledged group within Canada, and ultimately, the disappearance of the Aboriginal rights paradigm in the public view of Red River. The rebellion was successful in a sense that it allowed the M\u00e9tis to have a political voice, but it impacted the perception of how other Aboriginals would be viewed in Red River.", "Through the Act, the Red River colony was now christened as Manitoba: a new Canadian province that was self-governed, and that had its own rights and responsibilities. It was no longer being viewed as a territory and was now officially part of the Canadian confederation. Provincial status was accelerated by Louis Riel's rebellion. Riel wanted to secure Red River for the Canadians against the Americans' colonization projects and sentiments of their Manifest Destiny ideologies. The early Manitoba provincial government initially struggled to be effective. Everything around it felt rushed because the Manitoba Act was mostly created to prevent another Red River Rebellion. Many of the government officials were inexperienced \u2013 especially the three delegates who went to Ottawa to negotiate union terms. None of them had experience with diplomacy or the creation of new governments. Due to the hurried nature of the creation of this province, the officials of this new government presented themselves as overwhelmed and unprepared, and this shows that Manitoba was essentially created to re-stabilize political unrest within Canada."]}, {"page": "Chippewa Cree", "response": ["In May 1917 the Interior Department compiled another list of residents on the reservation. By then additional Native Americans had migrated there and others had left. Fewer than 45 of the 451 names listed on the \"Tentative Roll of the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation\" (1917) were Chippewa from the earlier 1909 roll. Many were Cree, descendants of Little Bear's (Imasees) band, and M\u00e9tis, descendants of the Louis Riel band of mixed-race peoples from the Red River of the North area. According to tribal traditions of absorbing war captives and protecting all children of tribal women, if residents identified as Cree or Chippewa, they were listed as Native American, regardless of whether they had other ancestry. The 1917 roll was approved by the Department of the Interior in July 1917; it has since been the basis for tribal membership rolls and allotments."]}, {"page": "Gabriel Dumont (M\u00e9tis leader)", "response": ["Dumont was born to Isidore Dumont and Louise Laframboise in 1837 in Red River. Growing up Dumont had little in the way of education \u2013 he was illiterate but could speak seven languages. In the early stages of his life, Dumont relied on buffalo hunting in order to gain a source of food. His family made a living through hunting buffalo and trading with the Hudson's Bay Company. After his time leading the M\u00e9tis people alongside Louis Riel, Dumont spent time travelling throughout the United States where he spoke at public speaking events and political campaigns. In 1889 he dictated his memoirs in Quebec.", "Dumont was known for his incredible versatility both as a huntsman and as a convenor of multilingualism. It was purported that Dumont could converse with an individual in no less than seven separate languages (although it was noted that Dumont never learned more than a few small phrases in English). His skills as a huntsman and marksman were another finely honed trait, in both the disciplines of bow and rifle. In addition to these traits, Dumont was known as a proficient horseman. In much the same vein as many of the other prominent M\u00e9tis leaders of his day such as Louis Riel, Dumont had mastered the fine art of diplomacy in the northern plains of the West.", "Dumont also played a key role in discovering the traitors within the Saskatchewan M\u00e9tis. In particular, Dumont was a part of the arrest of Alexander Monkman. Dumont ensured the safety of Louis Riel by jumping in front of Monkman's revolver when he pulled it on Riel, leading to Monkman's quick arrest.  Dumont was acutely aware that more Canadian troops led by General Frederick Middleton were streaming towards their location. In order to combat the advancing threat, Dumont proposed a campaign of terror that focused on uprooting railroads and prolonged periods of violence against Canadian soldiers. Riel was more inclined towards a peaceful resolution to proceedings, and Dumont deferred to Riel's judgements.", "During the 1880s Dumont's council sent petitions to the capital in Ottawa imploring the government to recognize the traditional land holdings (tenure) of the M\u00e9tis. When these petitions went unanswered by the prime minister and his cabinet, Dumont and the M\u00e9tis felt compelled to protect the land through a more direct method. In March 1884, a meeting was called by Dumont at the house of Abraham Montour, in which Dumont proceeded to call for Louis Riel to take up the mantle of leadership that Dumont had been previously holding. Subsequently, a delegation consisting of Dumont and three of his closest companions was sent to Riel requesting that he travel to Saskatchewan in order to provide insight into how best to protect M\u00e9tis lands and freedoms. Dumont and three others travelled to St. Peter's Jesuit Mission in Montana, and convinced Riel to ride north to Saskatchewan. From that point onwards, Dumont and Riel maintained a close friendship.", "The legacy of Dumont as a M\u00e9tis leader is one that is only outshone by that of Louis Riel. Gabriel Dumont has left a legacy behind that is known through schools, museums, institutions, books, and landmarks. In the spring of 2008, provincial Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed at Duck Lake, that \"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the Prairie M\u00e9tis and First Nations peoples' struggle with government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\" Batoche \u2013 the site of a M\u00e9tis Provisional Government, has been declared a National Historic Site.", "Category:Louis Riel"]}, {"page": "Preston Manning", "response": ["The major political traditions upon which Manning drew most heavily were those of the Reform tradition of pre- Confederation Canada, namely, the writings and experiences of Baldwin and Lafontaine, leaders of the Reform Parties of Upper and Lower Canada; and Joseph Howe, leader of the Reform Party of Nova Scotia.

His real intentions were to prevent another M\u00e9tis uprising in the short-term, and to allow for the gradual hegemony of new Canadian settlers in the region. Nevertheless, the specifics of his conciliation policy were opposed by Macdonald and Howe alike (Howe was by this time Macdonald's Indian Affairs minister). In the face of this opposition, Archibald submitted his resignation in late 1871. Macdonald initially had difficulty finding a replacement and asked Archibald to reconsider. The federal government chose Francis Godschall Johnson as his replacement on April 9, 1872, but this commission was revoked before Johnson was sworn in.

That increased tensions among the M\u00e9tis, who, in July 1869, had become more suspicious after McDougall ordered a survey of the settlement. Emerging as a leader, Louis Riel, who had been formally educated in European-style schools, denounced the survey in a speech delivered in late August from the steps of St. Boniface Cathedral. His lifestyle was very different from those of buffalo-hunting Metis. When Riel returned to the West, it was apparent that MacDonald feared that the United States was negotiating with HBC for the transfer Rupert's Land without consulting the Red River population and the Council of Assiniboia. On October 11, 1869, Riel and other M\u00e9tis disrupted the survey's work. On October 16 the group organized the \"M\u00e9tis National Committee\" to represent M\u00e9tis interests.

The first was Capitalistic Affection! (1982), in which a young boy absorbs sexual stereotypes in the weekly comic strips of the North American 1940s. The book uses comic strip idioms, mixed with occasional metafictional commentary, to analyze further the Arthurian inheritance and its imbrication with commodity culture, while also creating numerous disturbingly poignant moments. He followed this in 1986 with another anomalous work, The Abbotsford Guide to India, a book of poetry constructed as a tourist guide. Critic Katie Trumpener comments that 'Davey's Guide is a manifesto from Abbotsford about the connected perspectives and cultural cross-pollination of different peripheries,' one that 'bypasses ... the empire's nominal centre'Bardic Nationalism: The Romantic Novel and the British Empire, Princeton UP, Princeton NJ, pp. 244\u20135. and adds that the poems 'point to the obvious vestiges of colonial consciousness in a still emphatically British Columbia (especially in the survival of colonial attitudes toward its own 'Indians'), but they also identify more mysterious residues of colonial self-doubt and self-hatred.'Bardic Nationalism: The Romantic Novel and the British Empire, Princeton UP, Princeton NJ, p. 246. Again these books had little relationship to the ongoing lyric norms of Canadian poetry or, in their sharp movements away from each of Davey\u2019s preceding books, to the more consistent modes of poetic dissent being created by other Canadian poets such as bill bissett, Daphne Marlatt, and bpNichol.
