A former student of the Glasgow School of Art, Lindsay had begun his career as a photojournalist with limited financial success. In a hint of what was to come later, by the late sixties Lindsay had turned to photographing nudes for magazines like Penthouse and Mayfair.\nLindsay filmed his short films on 16 mm film for distribution on 8 mm film, as that was the major market. Hardcore pornography was just around the corner, and by 1974, Lindsay had shot around 100 blue films for the 8mm market. Ultimately, Lindsay would become as synonymous with blue films in the 1970s as Harrison Marks had with glamour photography in the 1960s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Outline of British pornography", "response": ["* John Jesnor Lindsay"]}, {"page": "Mary Millington", "response": ["Soon after becoming a glamour model, she met the glamour photographer and pornographer John Jesnor Lindsay, who offered to photograph her for softcore magazines. She became one of his most popular models and began appearing in 8\u00a0mm hardcore porn loops which sold well in Europe. One of her first films was Miss Bohrloch in 1970. Miss Bohrloch won the Golden Phallus Award at the Wet Dream Festival held in November 1970 in Amsterdam. Maxted starred in around twenty short hardcore films for John Lindsay, although only five (Miss Bohrloch, Oral Connection, Betrayed, Oh Nurse and Special Assignment) have so far resurfaced. She then returned to modelling for British pornographic magazines such as Knave and Men Only. She also appeared in softcore short films by Russell Gay (Response, 1974), Mountain Films (Love Games, Wild Lovers) and Harrison Marks (Sex is My Business, c.\u00a01974)."]}, {"page": "David McGillivray (screenwriter)", "response": ["McGillivray was soon involved in the British sex film industry, writing scripts for The Hot Girls (1974) and I'm Not Feeling Myself Tonight (1976), two films produced by pornographer John Jesnor Lindsay.

She moved to the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, studying at the London Film School  1971, and developing a curious Copenhagen/Cockney accent along the way. Represented by Barrie Stacey Promotions during her British acting career, she appeared in John Jesnor Lindsay's film The Hot Girls (1974), a fake expos\u00e9 of the modelling world. More mainstream work included guest appearances in The Sweeney and The Goodies, and roles in Carry On Behind (1975) and several other British sex comedies. Jacobson was also active on stage appearing in a touring production of Hair in 1974, and in the stage farce Pyjama Tops ( 1973) where co-stars included Fiona Richmond, Jess Conrad and Lucienne Camille."]}]}}
