The pilot was Robert von Greim, whom Hitler later appointed as the last commander of the Luftwaffe. He was met by striking workers at an airfield outside of Berlin, where he landed by mistake, and had to disguise himself. Eventually Hitler could continue his flight together with Dietrich Eckart to Berlin, where they immediately went to the Reichskanzlei to meet Wolfgang Kapp. Hitler and Eckart were approached by Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln, who told them that Kapp had fled and the coup failed.Werner Maser: Der Sturm auf die Republik.

Hakl, an Austrian publisher of esoteric works,Entry for Hans Thomas Hakl from the German National Library. traces the origins of the speculation about Nazism and Occultism back to several works from the early 1940s. His research was also published in a short book, Unknown sources: National Socialism and the Occult, translated by Goodrick-Clarke. Already in 1933 a pseudonymous Kurt van Emsen described Hitler as a \"demonic personality\", but his work was soon forgotten.Hakl 1997: 209. The first allusions that Hitler was directed by occult forces which were taken up by the later authors came from French Christian esotericist Ren\u00e9 Kopp.Hakl 1997: 210. In two articles published in the monthly esoteric journal Le Chariot from June 1934 and April 1939, he seeks to trace the source of Hitler's power to supernatural forces. The second article was titled: \"L'Enigme du Hitler\". In other French esoteric journals of the 1930s, Hakl could not find similar hints. In 1939 another French author, Edouard Saby, published a book: Hitler et les Forces Occultes.Hakl 1997: 212. Saby already mentions Hanussen and Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln.Hakl 1997: 214. Hakl even hints that Edouard Saby would have the copyright on the myth of Nazi occultism. However, another significant book from 1939 is better known: Hermann Rauschning's Hitler Speaks. There it is said (in the chapter \"Black and White Magic\"), that \"Hitler surrendered himself to forces that carried him away. (...) He turned himself over to a spell, which can, with good reason and not simply in a figurative analogy, be described as demonic magic.\"  The chapter \"Hitler in private\" is even more dramatic, and was left out in the German edition from 1940.Hakl 1997: 211."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Trebitsch-Lincoln", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Ign\u00e1cz Trebitsch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "List of people who made multiple religious conversions", "response": ["*Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln - Born an Orthodox Jew, he converted to Lutheranism to escape Austro-Hungarian authorities, and then converted to both Presbyterianism and Anglicanism and then finally converted to Buddhism towards the end of his life."]}, {"page": "Chao Kung", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln "]}, {"page": "Trebitsch Lincoln", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Ignatius Timothy Trebitsch-Lincoln", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Ignatius Timothy Tribich Lincoln", "response": ["#REDIRECTIgnaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Ignacz Trebitsch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln "]}, {"page": "Isaac Timothy Trebitsch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Isaac Trebitsch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Trebitsch", "response": ["*Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln (1879\u20131943), Hungarian adventurer"]}, {"page": "Lincoln, Ignatius Timotheus Trebitsch", "response": ["#REDIRECTIgnaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "Tribich Lincoln", "response": ["#REDIRECTIgnaz Trebitsch-Lincoln"]}, {"page": "I.
