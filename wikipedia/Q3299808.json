Gorman then postulated that this incident was worse than those because Briatore and Symonds set in motion \"an event of violent destruction, the consequences of which they could neither predict nor control.\" Matthew Syed countered that while the incident was premeditated, \"unspeakably unethical\" and dangerous, it was not nearly as reckless as the East German athletics doping scandal and other instances of long-term doping.
