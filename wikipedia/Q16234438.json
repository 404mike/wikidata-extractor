Despite the rest in the 1931 Wimbledon Championships he shocked the tennis world by losing in the very first round to Nigel Sharpe. In the mixed doubles Cochet and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall were not more successful, falling in the fourth round. The doubles final remained unconquered for Brugnon and Cochet as the team of George Lott and John Van Ryn came back from 3\u20132 down in the fifth set to win the match. In July the Four Musketeers were ready to be challenged for the fifth time in the Davis Cup final. This time the opponent was the British Davis Cup team. In the first rubber Cochet was facing two set points for a two sets-love lead by Bunny Austin but fought back to claim the second set and won the next two for the match. Fred Perry battled through Borotra while the doubles were won by Cochet and Brugnon. Austin brought back the British hopes after a four set victory over the exhausted Borotra. The match was suspended multiple times due to rain, which made the court almost unsuitable for playing, which left its mark on the deciding rubber between Cochet and Perry. The recurring slight rain in the first set led Perry to drop the set from a 4\u20131 advantage. The second set went to Perry after he utilized passing shots as a counter for Cochet's net play. The third and fourth set however were taken by Cochet which gave the French team its fifth successive Davis Cup."]}, {"page": "Hendrik Timmer", "response": ["He missed the whole 1931 season because of an illness. In early 1932 he suffered from pneumonia. In mid-June he made his comeback as a runner-up for the Queen's Club Championships having it lost to Jack Crawford in four sets. In Liverpool at the Northern tournament he clinched the title by defeating home-favorite Nigel Sharpe. The same year he played his first Dutch international final against von Kehrling but came short. The following year he went for the title again but was stopped the second time by Giorgio de Stefani in a four set final. Timmer found consolation in the doubles contest where he and Kehrling took revenge by defeating de Stefani and George Lyttleton-Rogers and gaining the title. The key of the winning form was that Timmer overcame his well-known weak serve. Also in 1933 he participated in the West of England Championships only losing to Daniel Prenn in the final. In the 1934 Dutch International Championships Timmer was eliminated early in the semifinal by Hermann Artens. He was also unsuccessful in retaining the doubles title with Kehrling as the Austrian duo of Artens and Georg von Metaxa won that title as well. He had to skip the 1937 season as a result of rheumatism in his shoulder. He fought one of his last matches in 1938 against Kenneth Gandar-Dower, a victory of only two sets."]}, {"page": "Christian Boussus", "response": ["At the peak of his career in 1932 his play was observed by Great Britain's then active Davis Cup player Nigel Sharpe who described him as the greatest French left-hander in the following manner: \"He relies upon an all-round game with volleying as his forte. There is nothing of hurricane speed in his game. He takes the ball on the rise and hist his forehand with an easy swing and without much topspin. He gets good pace in this stroke and usually relies upon it as the forerunner of a volleying campaign[\u2026]His backhand is of the cut variety but although putting so much slice on it he does not let it stop him from hitting it pretty hard. This stroke, of course, has its limitations, as it is distinctly difficult to make good passing shots against an agile volleyer. This wing is Boussus' chief weakness[\u2026] (he) is able to make his volley down the line with great speed...but does not use his wrist quite so much\". He further analysed his service game and found it be most unorthodox. Boussus completely omitted to swing his racquet behind his head while serving making his serves rather ineffective. Although this style was useful in overhead smashes when accuracy is more important than the speed. With this type of serve he also put a great spin to the ball and kept it relatively low. Later in his career he adapted to baseline play and utilized a series of dropshots in his games."]}, {"page": "1928 French Championships \u2013 Men's Singles", "response": ["#  Nigel Sharpe (Third round)"]}, {"page": "Bristol Open", "response": ["|1931 ||  George Lyttleton-Rogers ||  Nigel Sharpe || 6\u20132, 6\u20131, 7\u20135"]}, {"page": "Manchester Open", "response": ["| 1931 ||  John Olliff ||  Nigel Sharpe || 6\u20133, 3\u20136, 7\u20139, 6\u20133 ret.

So he was one of the few baseliners of his time. He hit the ball flat and with a short swing.
