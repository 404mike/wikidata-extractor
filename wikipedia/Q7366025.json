He kept his place for the last match of the season, and made ten Second Division appearances in 1971\u201372, as one of four players tried at left back, but the arrival of England international full back Keith Newton meant Wilson played no part in Burnley's 1972\u201373 Second Division-winning campaign. Shortly after his 20th birthday, after 18 months of second-eleven football, Wilson and fellow long-term reserve Ronnie Welch were signed by Brian Clough for Brighton & Hove Albion for \u00a370,000 the pair. He said later that he \"was happy at Burnley but if an offer comes in for you and they accept it there's not much you can do\"."]}]}}
