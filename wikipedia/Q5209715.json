His work on The Widow created by Two Brothers Pictures starring Kate Beckinsale led Euan Ferguson in The Observer to comment that in \"The Widow, the second, far better, half of episodes I now see were directed by Olly Blackburn, has been a grower, and ultimately rewarding... Alex Kingston and in particular Babs Olusanmokun, as the filthy General Azikiwe, drunk and surrounded by ghosts, were nuanced, conflicted.\". In 2019 he directed the first three episodes and established the world of Sanditon adapted by Andrew Davies from the unfinished novel by Jane Austen. Kathryn Van Arendonk described it in Vulture as \"an exquisite production, both beautiful and thoughtful. It's adapted in ways that feel smart and human, while also pumping some helpful friction into the story\". Writing in Indiewire Ann Donahue called it \"tart and political, gorgeous and honest\" while Deciders Meghan O'Keeffe pointed out Sanditon's modernity, \"Sanditon is a new kind of Jane Austen adaptation. Oozing with sex, concerned with racial and class politics, and full of scheming anti-heroines who will do whatever it takes to get to the top, it simultaneously throws away the quaint, courtly image of Austen's work while embracing the bitter acid of her pen. Yes, Jane Austen was one for harsh social satire, and Sanditon not only brings that back, but dares to swap the fairy tale ending for something closer to real life. All in all, it makes for a profoundly juicy watch that will both enrapture and enrage its audience \u2013 and I loved every second of it.\". Blackburn shared his thoughts on filming historical adaptations like Sanditon in The Atlantic: \"'Viewers in the 21st century want\u2014demand\u2014to see a version of the past that stresses its similarities with the present day'... They want to see Austen rescued from tweeness and coziness. Today\u2019s comparison for the turmoil in Sanditon, then, would be to Brexit, \u201cwith huge economic change dislocating people,\u201d he added. In the new settlement described by Austen, \u201cthere is huge economic unease, particularly among the upper class, about industrial change\". For Blackburn, every adaptation is inevitably a reflection of its adapters, and the time in which it is made. \u201cYou can\u2019t take the observer out of the equation,\u201d he said. At the same time, though: \u201cSex, pain, rage, envy \u2026 These things are timeless.\u201d"]}, {"page": "Jocasta Innes", "response": ["Jocasta was survived by her partner who died in 2014, and her four children, Daisy Goodwin, Jason Goodwin, Tabitha and Chloe Potts, and nine grandchildren."]}, {"page": "Ruth Barrett", "response": ["|Daisy Goodwin"]}, {"page": "Victoria (British TV series)", "response": ["Victoria is a British historical television drama series created and principally written by Daisy Goodwin, starring Jenna Coleman as Queen Victoria.
