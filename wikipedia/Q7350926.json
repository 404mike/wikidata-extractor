Influenced by millenarian ideas, he moved across his adult life from Methodism and towards Unitarian leanings, before rejecting Christianity and embracing a deist outlook on life. An early freethinker, a combination of his deist views, associations with well-known radicals and atheists, and utopian political ideals led to his arrest for breach of blasphemy laws.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peterloo Massacre", "response": ["The government declared its support for the actions taken by the magistrates and the army.
