Sheila McKenny was born on 2 November 1930 in Gilberdyke, East Yorkshire, but grew up in Lincolnshire. Her father was chronically unemployed and the family struggled financially during the Great Depression and the Second World War. Her mother valued education and Sheila won a scholarship at the girls' grammar school in Sleaford (Kesteven and Sleaford High School); she was the first in her family to attend a grammar school (her parents had been unable to afford her brother's uniform when he won a place at the boys' equivalent), and went from there to the London School of Economics to read sociology \u2013 a venture her father considered \"pointless\" for a woman but which her mother also encouraged. After graduating, she completed a postgraduate course in anthropology based on fieldwork in south-east Asia. She was a senior research assistant for a time, and then joined the University of Leicester as a lecturer in sociology in 1961. Five years later, she moved to the University of Bradford to take up a senior lectureship. She was promoted to a readership there in 1971, and then in 1972 became the university's first female professor when she was appointed to the Chair in Sociology. She stayed in the position until retiring in 1999, after which she remained at Bradford as an emeritus professor. Outside of university, she was President of the British Sociological Association from 1975 to 1977.Helen Roberts and Juliet Webster, \"Sheila Allen: Uncompromising sociologist who pioneered the concept of institutional racism in Britain\", The Independent, 4 May 2009.
