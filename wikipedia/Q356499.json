In his lifetime he was sometimes ranked with his contemporary Benjamin Britten as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio A Child of Our Time, the orchestral Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli, and the opera The Midsummer Marriage.\nTippett's talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences, including those of jazz and blues after his first visit to America in 1965, became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett's stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 Tippett's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett's legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has been performed infrequently in the 21st century.\nHaving briefly embraced communism in the 1930s, Tippett avoided identifying with any political party. A pacifist after 1940, he was imprisoned in 1943 for refusing to carry out war-related duties required by his military exemption. His initial difficulties in accepting his homosexuality led him in 1939 to Jungian psychoanalysis; the Jungian dichotomy of \"shadow\" and \"light\" remained a recurring factor in his music. He was a strong advocate of music education, and was active for much of his life as a radio broadcaster and writer on music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)", "response": ["Michael Tippett in his Third Symphony (1972) quotes the opening of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth and then criticises the utopian understanding of the brotherhood of man as expressed in the Ode to Joy and instead stresses man's capacity for both good and evil."]}, {"page": "Flugelhorn", "response": ["The flugelhorn is a standard member of the British-style brass band, and it is also used frequently in jazz. It also appears occasionally in orchestral and concert band music. Famous orchestral works with flugelhorn include Igor Stravinsky's Threni, Ralph Vaughan Williams's Ninth Symphony, and Michael Tippett's third symphony. The flugelhorn is sometimes substituted for the post horn in Mahler's Third Symphony, and for the soprano Roman buccine in Ottorino Respighi's Pines of Rome. In HK Gruber's trumpet concerto Busking (2007) the soloist is directed to play a flugelhorn in the slow middle movement. The flugelhorn figured prominently in many of Burt Bacharach's 1960s pop song arrangements. It is featured in a solo role in Bert Kaempfert's 1962 recording of \"That Happy Feeling\". Flugelhorns have occasionally been used as the alto or low soprano voice in a drum and bugle corps."]}, {"page": "Go Down Moses", "response": ["* It is one of the five spirituals included in the oratorio A Child of Our Time, first performed in 1944, by the English classical composer Michael Tippett (190598)."]}, {"page": "January 2", "response": ["*  1905   \u2013 Michael Tippett, English composer and conductor (d. 1998)"]}, {"page": "January 8", "response": ["*1998 \u2013 Michael Tippett, English composer and conductor (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "Priam", "response": ["* King Priam, a 1962 opera by Michael Tippett"]}, {"page": "Recorder (musical instrument)", "response": ["Modern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including Paul Hindemith, Luciano Berio, J\u00fcrg Baur, Josef Tal, John Tavener, Michael Tippett, Benjamin Britten, Leonard Bernstein, Gordon Jacob, Malcolm Arnold, Steven Stucky, Sean Hickey, and Edmund Rubbra."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom", "response": ["Various styles of music are popular in the UK, including the indigenous folk music of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

A shy man, he did not welcome this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was an important influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.", "Warrack emphasises that Holst acquired an instinctive understanding\u2014perhaps more so than any English composer\u2014of the importance of folksong. In it he found \"a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language\". Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as \"the greatest influence on my music\",Short, pp. 336\u201338 although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally. Among later composers, Michael Tippett is acknowledged by Short as Holst's \"most significant artistic successor\", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there. Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: \"Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision\".Tippett, p. 15 Kennedy observes that \"a new generation of listeners\u00a0... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett\". Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: \"With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone\"."]}, {"page": "List of prominent operas", "response": ["* 1955 The Midsummer Marriage (Michael Tippett).

In defining his mission as a composer of opera, Britten wrote: \"One of my chief aims is to try to restore to the musical setting of the English Language a brilliance, freedom and vitality that have been curiously rare since the death of Purcell\". Among the closest of Britten's kindred composer spirits \u2013 even more so than Purcell \u2013 was Mahler, whose Fourth Symphony Britten heard in September 1930. At that time Mahler's music was little regarded and rarely played in English concert halls. Britten later wrote of how the scoring of this work impressed him: \"...\u00a0entirely clean and transparent\u00a0... the material was remarkable, and the melodic shapes highly original, with such rhythmic and harmonic tension from beginning to end\". He soon discovered other Mahler works, in particular Das Lied von der Erde; he wrote to a friend about the concluding \"Abschied\" of Das Lied: \"It is cruel, you know, that music should be so beautiful\".Letter to Henry Boys, 29 June 1937, quoted in  Apart from Mahler's general influence on Britten's compositional style, the incorporation by Britten of popular tunes (as, for example, in Death in Venice) is a direct inheritance from the older composer."]}, {"page": "Alan Bush", "response": ["Bush had begun to develop an interest in politics during the war years.

Deller initially identified as an \"alto\", but his collaborator Michael Tippett recommended the archaic term \"countertenor\" to describe his voice. In the 1950s and 60s, his group, the Deller Consort, was important in increasing audiences' awareness (and appreciation) of Renaissance and Baroque music. Deller was the first modern countertenor to achieve fame and has had many prominent successors. Benjamin Britten wrote the leading role of Oberon in his setting of A Midsummer Night's Dream (1960) especially for Deller. The countertenor role of Apollo in Britten's Death in Venice (1973) was created by James Bowman, the best-known amongst the next generation of English countertenors. Russell Oberlin was Deller's American counterpart and another early music pioneer. Oberlin's success was entirely unprecedented in a country that did not have much experience of performance of works prior to Bach, and it paved the way for the great success of countertenors following him. Oberlin, however, harked back to the earlier tradition of countertenors using only their modal voices."]}, {"page": "Oratorio", "response": ["Oratorio returned haltingly to public attention with Igor Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex in Paris (1927), William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast in Leeds (1931), Paul Hindemith's Das Unaufh\u00f6rliche in Berlin (1931), Arthur Honegger's Le Roi David and Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher in Basel (1938), and Franz Schmidt's The Book with Seven Seals (Das Buch mit sieben Siegeln) in Vienna (1938).
