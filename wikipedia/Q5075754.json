The core group members from Caroline's immediate family were her sisters Mary Hennell (23 May 1802 \u2013 16 May 1843) and Sara Hennell (1812\u20131899), and her brother Charles Christian Hennell (1809\u20131850). Charles Hennell was a writer on theological and philosophical topics whose most important work was An Inquiry Concerning the Origin of Christianity (London, 1838). Although Caroline's father James Hennell (8 October 1782 \u2013 30 January 1816) was a devout Unitarian who raised his children as Unitarians, his 3 children who were core members of the Rosehill Circle all entertained serious reservations about many Unitarian beliefs.", "[ Vol. 2 ( pp.\u00a0493\u2013663 ) contains an anonymous, untitled Appendix by Mary Hennell (1802\u20131843). Mary's authorship of this Appendix is known because the Appendix was reprinted ( under the title \"Social Systems and Communities\" ) in a book published in 1844, and in that book the authorship of the Appendix is attributed by Charles Bray to Mary ( see the next item for a complete explanation ). ]", "[ Neither Charles Bray's nor Mary Hennell's name appears on the title page of this book, but bibliographers usually attribute the book to Mary Hennell. It is known that Charles Bray authored this book's \"Preface\" (pp. iii\u2013iv) and \"Introduction\" (pp. v\u2013cxiv) since Bray was the author of The Philosophy of Necessity. The work by Mary Hennell ( 1802\u20131843 ) which had appeared as the anonymous, untitled Appendix in vol. 2 of Bray's The Philosophy of Necessity (1841) appears in this book under the title \"Social Systems and Communities\" as the second part (pp.\u00a01\u2013252) of the book. On p. iii of this book (in the Preface) Bray reveals that Mary Hennell was the author of the Appendix in vol. 2 of his The Philosophy of Necessity. Also on p. iii of this book Bray states that Mary Hennell died of consumption in March 1843. However, other unrelated, genealogical sources exist which state that Mary Hennell died on 16 May 1843. At this time it is believed that 16 May 1843 is the correct date of Mary's death, but this has not been verified. ]"]}, {"page": "List of glass artists", "response": ["*Charles Bray (1922\u20132012)"]}, {"page": "Charles Bray - Glass Artist", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Bray (glass artist)"]}, {"page": "Glasmuseet Ebeltoft", "response": ["Artists represented by work in the collection include Klaus Moje and Nick Mount of Australia; Louis Leloup of Belgium; V\u00e1clav Ciglar, Franti\u0161ek Jan\u00e1k, Ji\u0159\u00ed Harcuba, Pavel Hlava, Stanislav Libensk\u00fd and Jaroslava Brychtov\u00e1 and Ren\u00e9 Roub\u00ed\u010dek of the Czech Republic; Eva Engstr\u00f6m, Finn Lynggaard and Tchai Munch of Denmark; Ivo Lill of Estonia; Erwin Eisch, Ursula Merker, Gerhard Ribka, Kurt Wallstab and Ann Wolff of Germany; Ursula Huber-Peer, Pino Signoretto, Bruno Pedrosa and Lino Tagliapietra of Italy; Durk Valkema and Sybren Valkema of the Netherlands; Anna Carlgren, Gunnar Cyr\u00e9n, Eva Englund, G\u00f6ran W\u00e4rff and Ulrica Hydman-Vallien of Sweden, Charles Bray and David Reekie of the United Kingdom; and Rick Beck, Gary Beecham, William Bernstein, Katharine Bernstein, Nicole Chesney, Dale Chihuly, Fritz Dreisbach, Shane Fero, Robert Fritz, Michael Glancy, Richard Jolley, Jon Kuhn, Marvin Lipofsky, Harvey Littleton, John Littleton/Kate Vogel, Dante Marioni, Richard Marquis, Joel Philip Myers, Mary Shaffer, Paul Stankard, Michael Taylor and Toots Zynsky of the United States."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society of Arts", "response": ["* Charles Bray"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2012", "response": ["*Charles Bray, 89\u201390, British painter and glass sculptor.http://www.glasshouse.de/spot/charles-bray.html"]}, {"page": "Charlie Bray", "response": ["*Charles Bray (1811\u20131884), British ribbon manufacturer, social reformer and phrenologist", "*Charles Bray (glass artist) (1922\u20132012), British painter and glass sculptor"]}]}}
