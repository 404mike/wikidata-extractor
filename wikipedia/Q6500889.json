Stevens left shortly after the band was formed, and Arthur and Luscombe continued as a duo. The group's name derived from the dessert of the same name. The duo released their first EP, Irene and Mavis, the following year, but their first real exposure came via the track \"Sad Day\" on the Some Bizzare Album compilation, alongside acts such as Soft Cell and Depeche Mode. This led to them signing a recording contract with London Records.  In December 1981 they supported Japan on their \"Visions of China\" UK tour."]}, {"page": "Touch (Eurythmics album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 art direction, design"]}, {"page": "Medusa (Annie Lennox album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 sleeve design"]}, {"page": "Be Yourself Tonight", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 art, design"]}, {"page": "Revenge (Eurythmics album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 sleeve designs"]}, {"page": "Savage (Eurythmics album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 sleeve design"]}, {"page": "We Too Are One", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 design, artwork"]}, {"page": "Peace (Eurythmics album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 sleeve design, graphics"]}, {"page": "Greatest Hits (Eurythmics album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 art, design"]}, {"page": "Ultimate Collection (Eurythmics album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 art direction, graphic design"]}, {"page": "Diva (Annie Lennox album)", "response": ["* Laurence Stevens \u2013 sleeve designs"]}, {"page": "I've Got a Life", "response": ["*Art Direction, Design [Graphic Design] \u2013 Laurence Stevens"]}]}}
