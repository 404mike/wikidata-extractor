In June 1895, Gemma's mother, Virginia Doyle, is killed after hearing that someone named Circe is near, leaving Gemma with her strange amulet in the shape of the Crescent Eye. The Doyle family moves back to England. Gemma, then only sixteen, is sent to Spence Academy rather abruptly.

The only subject that she stood out in was singing; Ann proved to have a beautiful voice.  She lacked the money and beauty of the other girls, and so lacked friends.  She was often bullied by the other girls, especially Felicity Worthington, and Pippa Cross.  In 1895, however, when Ann was fifteen, a new girl came to Spence.  Gemma Doyle became Ann's roommate. A friendship formed by virtue of their having no other friends and of being roommates.  When Felicity came into Gemma's debt, Gemma became friend with Felicity and Pippa, under condition that they would befriend Ann, too.  This relationship, first one of obligation, later became real.  The girls bonded, and came to love each other.  In December of that year, Felicity even took Ann home with her over Christmas break, as Ann would otherwise have had to stay at their school. There they tried to pass her off as the grand-niece of the Duke of Chesterfield but before returning home they are found out and Ann is then ruined.
