He wrote as Sydney J. Bounds and S. J. Bounds, as well as under the pen names Clifford Wallace, James Marshall, Earl Ellison and Rex Marlowe. He wrote over forty novels and hundreds of short stories, many published under pseudonyms or anonymously. He was best known for his science fiction, but also wrote horror, Westerns, mysteries and juveniles.\nBounds' debut professional sale under his own name appears in 1946 in the first issue of Outlands magazine, the publication of which left Bounds feeling that his post-war career as an electrical fitter seemed less inviting than one writing fiction.Bounds never married. He lived in Kingston upon Thames until May 2006, when he moved to Telford, Shropshire where died on 25 November 2006 at the age of 86. Since 2007 his name is honoured by the British Fantasy Awards' Sydney J. Bounds Best Newcomer Award (a revival of the earlier Icarus and Newcomer Awards), which is sponsored and funded by his estate.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Sydney James Bounds (1920\u20132006)"]}, {"page": "Sydney J.
