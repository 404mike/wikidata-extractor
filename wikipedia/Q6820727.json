The town was improved greatly during this period through the efforts of Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, the town's mayor and a local philanthropist, who helped to establish the town's first library and museum. The Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum was housed in his mansion, and after his death, it was given to the town.Ashley and Ashley (p.22) Bournemouth became a municipal borough in 1890 and a county borough in 1900.", "The Russell-Cotes Museum is a Grade II* listed, villa completed in 1901.

Etty had developed a reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as Rubens as well as being overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered tasteless and obscene. The Dawn of Love was not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 retrospective exhibition of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained in the collection of the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum ever since.", "The Dawn of Love (under its original title of Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love) was exhibited in 1829 at the Birmingham Society of Arts, but other than that its history during Etty's lifetime is not recorded. No record of its original sale exists, and it was not among the 133 paintings included in the major retrospective exhibition of Etty's works at the Royal Society of Arts in 1849. It is known that in 1835 it was in the collection of textile entrepreneur Joseph Strutt, but it was not among the paintings sold on his death in 1844. In June 1889 it was bought from an unknown buyer for an unknown sum by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained in the collection of the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth ever since. It was shown at an 1899 exhibition of works from Russell-Cotes's collection at the Glasgow Corporation Gallery. This exhibition caused some controversy owing to its supposed obscene nature; in 1894 a number of supposedly obscene prints of works by major artists had been removed from a Glasgow shop by police and magistrates, and it was felt inappropriate for a publicly funded educational body to be displaying a work of equal obscenity. Several luminaries of the art world such as Frederic Leighton intervened, and the exhibition went ahead. The Dawn of Love was also exhibited at a 1955 Arts Council exhibition, and was one of the works exhibited in a major retrospective of Etty's works at the York Art Gallery in 2011\u201312."]}, {"page": "List of people from Bournemouth", "response": ["* Sir Merton Russell-Cotes FRGS (1835\u20131921) was Mayor of Bournemouth 1894\u201395"]}, {"page": "Sir Merton Russell-Cotes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Merton Russell-Cotes"]}, {"page": "Bournemouth Town Hall", "response": ["Works of art in the town hall include a portrait of Captain Lewis Tregonwell of the Dorset Yeomanry by Thomas Beach and a portrait of the former mayor, Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and his wife, Lady Annie Russell-Cotes, by Frank Richards."]}, {"page": "Royal Bath Hotel", "response": ["The hotel was formerly owned by Mayor of Bournemouth Merton Russell-Cotes."]}, {"page": "Merton (given name)", "response": ["* Merton Russell-Cotes (1835\u20131921), mayor of Bournemouth, England"]}, {"page": "Mayor of Bournemouth", "response": ["*1894 Merton Russell-Cotes"]}, {"page": "Annie Russell-Cotes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Merton Russell-Cotes"]}]}}
