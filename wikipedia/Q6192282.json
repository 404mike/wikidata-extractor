Jigar was educated at Rushey Mead School and  Gateway College in the City.  He is, as of June 2015, playing for Leicestershire.\nNaik who played for Kibworth and Billesdon as well as Loughborough MCCU, made history when he became the first Leicester-born Asian to play for Leicestershire in a first-class game against a touring West Indies A side. Naik took one wicket, that of test batsmen Dwayne Smith.\nIn Naik's first county game against Glamorgan in the Pro40, he took 3/24.\nNaik has been a consistsent performer since 2009. In 2009 he was named Leicestershire's most improved uncapped player. In 2010, Naik topped the national bowling averages with 35 wickets at an average of 17.59, including 7\u201396 against Surrey at The Oval. A lot of credit for this has to go to his spin partner at Leics, Claude Henderson. Both received new 2-year contracts at the end of the 2011 season.Naik missed a large part of the 2012 season when he damaged ankle ligaments in early May, not making a comeback until August.Naik did make an excellent start to the 2013 season when he took 5\u201398 against Worcestershire in early May. His season came to a premature end when he dislocated a shoulder against Nottinghamshire on 12 July.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 10", "response": ["*  1984   \u2013 Jigar Naik, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Jigar Naik"]}, {"page": "Matthew Boyce", "response": ["Boyce's fielding would play a similarly instrumental role for the Foxes in the final of the following year's Twenty20 competition on 27 August 2011, again at Edgbaston. Boyce had played in the Super Over victory over the Lancashire Lightning in the day's earlier semi-final, although he was not needed to bat. For the evening's final against Somerset, he was replaced in the Foxes' team by Jigar Naik. However, once again Jefferson had batted but was not able to take to the field, again due to an Achilles problem. This meant that Boyce would again appear as a substitute for Jefferson at Edgbaston. Boyce took the catches of James Hildreth, Peter Trego, Jos Buttler and Alfonso Thomas, all off the bowling of man of the match Josh Cobb, thus helping to steer the Foxes to a win by 18 runs and clinch the trophy."]}, {"page": "Rushey Mead Academy", "response": ["* Jigar Naik \u2014 Leicestershire cricketer"]}, {"page": "2011 Champions League Twenty20 squads", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"| 22 ||Jigar Naik ||style=\"text-align:center\"|  ||  || Right || Right arm off spin"]}, {"page": "George Walker (cricketer, born 1984)", "response": ["Having not secured any first-class contracts with other county sides, Walker returned to Minor counties cricket with Norfolk in 2005.
