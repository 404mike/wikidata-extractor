He was born at Prestbury, near Cheltenham, 21 November 1850. His height was 6 ft. 1 in.; weight, 13 st. According to W. G. Grace:\n\nHe was a good bowler and batsman: but it was by his brilliant fielding that he made his reputation; and there can be little doubt that at long-leg or cover-point he had few equals in his own time. Many a batsman, having hit a ball in the direction of cover-point, started to run, being ignorant of his wonderful quickness and great reach, and feeling certain he could never get to it; but not only did he get to it, but picking it up with surprising quickness, he had it into the wicket-keeper's or bowler's hands like a flash and seconds before the batsman had reached his crease!\nAt Cheltenham College, where he was educated, they tell of a smart bit of fielding which he did when the M.C.C. played the College Eleven one year. He was bowling to George Hearne, who stepped back and pulled him twice between the wicket and mid-on. The third ball was bowled in the same place, and Hearne pulled it again; but Mr. Strachan moved a yard or two when he saw him make up his mind to hit in the same way, and brought off a remarkable catch yards from the wicket.\n\nAs a batsman he had sound defence, and hit freely. \nHe represented Gloucestershire, Middlesex, and Surrey. He captained Surrey from 1872 to 1875 and from 1877 to 1878. For the Gentlemen v. Players in 1872 he met with marked success as a bowler, and in the same match at The Oval in 1875 he took five wickets in 21 balls, off which no runs were scored.\nGeorge Strachan died on 29 December 1901, at Middelburg, Transvaal, South Africa.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Surrey cricket captains", "response": ["Since attaining first-class status, Surrey have named 41 official captains, including two who have been appointed twice: George Strachan in the late nineteenth century and Errol Holmes, who had spells either side of the Second World War.", "|  ||align=\"left\" | George Strachan ||  || 1872\u201318751877\u20131878 "]}, {"page": "W.

Grace's cricket career (1864 to 1870)", "response": ["It is generally understood that Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formally constituted in 1870, having developed from Dr Henry Grace's West Gloucestershire club.Birley, p.104. Gloucestershire acquired first-class status when its team played against Surrey at Durdham Down near Bristol on 2, 3 & 4 June 1870. With Grace and his brothers E.M. and Fred playing, Gloucestershire won that game by 51 runs and quickly became one of the best teams in England. The club was unanimously rated Champion County in 1876 and 1877 as well as sharing the unofficial title in 1873 and staking a claim for it in 1874.Webber, County Championship, pp.14\u201320. The Gloucestershire team in the club's inaugural match was (in batting order): E. M. Grace, W. G. Grace, Thomas Matthews (career from 1870 to 1878), Frank Townsend (1870 to 1891), Fred Grace, Charles Filgate (1869 to 1877), John Halford (1870 to 1874), John Mills (1870 only), James Bush (1870 to 1890), Robert Miles (1867 to 1879) and William Macpherson (1870 to 1871). The three Graces, Filgate and Miles had played first-class cricket previously but the other six were all debutants in this match. Surrey and Gloucestershire played a return match at The Oval in July 1870 and Gloucestershire won this by an innings and 129 runs. Grace scored 143, sharing a second wicket partnership with Townsend (89) of 234. He took eight wickets in the match but the outstanding bowler was slow left-armer Miles who took 6\u201386 and 6\u201320. George Strachan (career from 1870 to 1882) and Charles Gordon (1870 to 1875) made their first appearances for Gloucestershire."]}, {"page": "W. G. Grace in the 1871 English cricket season", "response": ["Gloucestershire defeated Surrey at The Oval by an innings and 60 runs, a significant victory for the new county club against one of the established counties. Surrey batted first and were bowled out for 161, largely due to George Strachan who took 5/45. Grace opened the Gloucestershire first innings with his brother E. M. but both were dismissed cheaply and Gloucestershire had to recover from a position of 7\u20132 to make 315, half-centuries being scored by Charles Gordon, Fred Grace and Robert Miles. James Street took 7/141 for Surrey. Batting again, Surrey needed 154 to avoid the innings defeat but were bowled out for 94 by E. M. and W. G. Grace who took all ten wickets between them, brother Fred helping the cause by holding three catches.", "Gloucestershire played four county matches in 1871. They twice defeated Surrey by an innings margin but had less success against Nottinghamshire, drawing with them at Clifton College Close Ground and then losing by 10 wickets at Trent Bridge. The team had certain regulars but tended to include occasional and even guest players, some of whom weakened the side, whereas Nottinghamshire generally turned out a full-strength eleven. The key Gloucestershire players were the three Graces, batsman Thomas Matthews, wicket-keeper James Bush (who was also an England rugby union international), slow left-armer Robert Miles and all-rounders George Strachan and Frank Townsend. Newcomers in 1871 were Frederic Carter and George Wyatt who both made a number of appearances over the next few seasons."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|George Strachan"]}, {"page": "Alfred Brooks (cricketer)", "response": ["Brooks made two first-class appearances for Nottinghamshire in 1877, both against Surrey.  In his first match at Trent Bridge, Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 150 all out, with Brooks scoring 6 runs before he was dismissed by James Southerton.  In response, Surrey made 103 all out in their first-innings, with Brooks taking the wickets of George Elliott and Allen Chandler to finish with figures of 2/10 from twelve overs.  Responding in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire made 120 all out, with Brooks being dismissed for 3 runs by George Strachan.  In their second-innings, Surrey made 149 all out, with Brooks taking the wickets of Harry Jupp and Chandler, to finish with figures of 2/30 from 26.1 overs.  Nottinghamshire won the match by 18 runs.  In the return fixture at The Oval, Surrey won the toss and elected to bat, making 250 all out in their first-innings, during which Brooks took the wicket of George Jones to finish with figures of 1/45 from 32.1 overs.  Nottinghamshire could then only manage just 97 all out in their first-innings, with him ending the innings not out on 1.  Forced to follow-on in their second-innings, Nottinghamshire were dismissed for 247, with Brooks himself dismissed for a duck by Ted Barratt.
