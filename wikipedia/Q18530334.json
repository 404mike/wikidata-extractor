Spurred into action by the Hull triple trawler tragedy of 1968 which claimed 58 lives, she led a direct action campaign to prevent undermanned trawlers from putting to sea and gathered 10,000 signatures for a petition (the Fishermen's Charter) to Harold Wilson's government to strengthen safety legislation.  She threatened to picket Wilson's house if he did not take action. Government ministers later implemented all of the measures outlined in the charter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hull triple trawler tragedy (1968)", "response": ["The trawlermen and their families formed a close-knit community in Hull, and the first two losses were a devastating blow. A safety campaign led by fisherman's wife Lillian Bilocca began; meetings were arranged between trawlermen's wives and trawler owners, and also with government ministers, and some wives picketed the dock to ensure all departing ships carried radio operators, attracting much national media attention. The national newspapers called it 'The Headscarf Campaign', as headscarves were popular with working women in the 1960s. As the wives' deputation arrived at the dock in front of TV cameras and journalists on 5 February for the meeting with the trawler owners, news broke of the loss of Ross Cleveland. The following day the women travelled to London, again with massive media coverage, and met ministers to discuss a variety of reforms to the fishing industry. The same day, trawler owners were instructed to implement new safety arrangements based on the outcome of the meeting, with immediate effect."]}, {"page": "List of people from Kingston upon Hull", "response": ["*Lillian Bilocca, British fisheries worker and campaigner for improved safety in fishing fleet as leader of the \"headscarf revolutionaries\""]}, {"page": "Reg Meuross", "response": ["In 2018 Meuross released 12 Silk Handkerchiefs, an album comprising a song cycle which encapsulates the story of the 1968 Hull triple trawler tragedy in which 58 men lost their lives, and the subsequent campaign led by fishwife Lillian Bilocca for improved safety conditions on trawlers."]}, {"page": "Lucy Beaumont (comedian)", "response": ["She co-wrote and starred in the radio sitcom To Hull and Back (2014\u20132018), starring fellow Hull actor Maureen Lipman.

A campaign was started amongst local fishermen's wives, led by Lillian Bilocca, to improve safety standards aboard the trawlers.
