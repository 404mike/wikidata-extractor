Winger Guly do Prado scored twice, before Adam Lallana and substitute Lee Barnard topped off the match with goals in the second half. Thanks to results elsewhere in the league, the result sent the club to the automatic promotion places for the first time in the season. Just two days later, the Saints travelled to play the return match against Dagenham & Redbridge, after beating the side 4\u20130 in November. After a goalless first half and numerous Saints chances, the visiting club broke the deadlock less than two minutes after the break, when Adam Lallana scored his eighth of the season with an overhead kick.

The first half was dominated by the struggling home side, and marked by a goal for midfielder John Welsh following a miscommunication between Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis and defender Jos\u00e9 Fonte. The visiting team continued to struggle in the second half, and under-performances from players such as Rickie Lambert, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Guly do Prado meant that Rovers doubled their lead thanks to a goal from Dale Jennings, sending the Saints down to fourth below local rivals Bournemouth following their win over league leaders Brighton.", "Southampton essentially confirmed their promotion in the penultimate game of the season against Plymouth Argyle on 2 May, when they won 3\u20131 after dominating the entire match.

Defender Ryan Dickson made it two with his first of the season shortly after the break, before a foul gave the Saints a penalty which Lambert confidently converted to put the visitors three up within the hour and all-but confirm the relegation of struggling Plymouth. Yannick Bolasie picked up a consolation for the home side in injury time, but it was not enough to save their League One status. Southampton confirmed their promotion in the last game of the season on 7 May against Walsall, winning 3\u20131. The game was largely dominated by the home side, who scored twice in a three-minute period in the first half, with goals coming from Guly do Prado and David Connolly.
