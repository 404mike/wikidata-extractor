B. Kitaj", "response": ["Kitaj married his first wife, Elsi Roessler, in 1953; they had a son, screenwriter Lem Dobbs, and adopted a daughter, Dominie. Elsi committed suicide in 1969. After living with her for 12 years, he married Sandra Fisher in December 1983 and they had one son, Max. Sandra Fisher died in 1994, at age 47, from acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (not an aneurysm, as is commonly written). Kitaj had a mild heart attack in 1990. He died in Los Angeles in October 2007, eight days before his 75th birthday.Obituary, The Independent, October 25, 2007  Seven weeks after Kitaj's death, the Los Angeles County coroner ruled that the cause of death was suicide.", "A second retrospective was staged at the Tate Gallery in 1994. Critical reviews in London were almost universally negative. British press savagely attacked the Tate exhibit, calling Kitaj a pretentious poseur who engaged in name dropping. Kitaj took the criticism very personally, declaring that \"anti-intellectualism, anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism\" had fueled the vitriol. Despite the bad reviews, the exhibition moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and afterwards to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1995. His second wife, Sandra Fisher died from hyperacute haemorrhagic leuco-encephalitis in 1994, shortly after his exhibition at the Tate Gallery had ended. He blamed the British press for her death, stating that \"they were aiming for me, but they got her instead.\" David Hockney concurred and said that he too believed the London art critics had killed Sandra Fisher.R. B. Kitaj 1932\u20132007, Charles Donelan, Santa Barbara Independent Retrieved January 25, 2011 Kitaj returned to the US in 1997 and settled in Los Angeles, near his first son. \"When my Wife died\", he wrote to Edward Chaney, \"London died for me and I returned home to California to live among sons and grandsons \u2013 It was a very good move and now I begin my 3rd and (last?) ACT! hands across The Sea.\"Postcard (Whistler vs. Ruskin 1992) dated June 1999. Three years later he wrote: \"I grow older every day and rather like my hermit life.\"Postcard to Edward Chaney: My Cat and Her Husband 1977, dated June 2002. The \"Tate War\" and Sandra's death became a central themes for his later works: he often depicted himself and his deceased wife as angels. In Los Angeles No. 22 (Painting-Drawing) the beautiful young (and naked) girl records the shadow of her aged lover (on whose lap she sits) in a pose directly taken from the Scots Grand Tourist David Allan's Origin of Painting. The latter was included by Ernst Gombrich in his 1995 National Gallery exhibition (and catalogue) on Shadows so that Kitaj would have seen it two years before he left England for ever.Chaney, \"Warburgian Artist\", p. 102"]}, {"page": "Chouinard Art Institute", "response": ["* Sandra Fisher (1947\u20131994), painter"]}, {"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Sandra Fisher (1947\u20131994), American painter"]}, {"page": "Margaret Fisher (artist)", "response": ["Fisher was born in 1948 in Miami, Florida and grew up in a family of painters that included her mother, Ethel Fisher, and sister, Sandra Fisher Kitaj.Motika, Libby. \"Painter to Painter: Ethel Fisher and R.B.
