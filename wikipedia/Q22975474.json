He was closely involved with surveying a suitable route and in promoting the route amidst considerable disagreement and opposition. The route was eventually published in his guidebook entitled Cambrian Way \u2013 The Mountain Connoisseur's Walk and it became the definitive route of the way. Much of his life was dedicated to footpaths both in his native county of Gloucestershire and also in Wales, where much of his walking and mountain climbing took place. He was first recorded as Footpath Secretary to the Gloucestershire Ramblers in 1951, at the age of 28 and he continued in the office until his retirement in 2008. He was also a major contributor to the creation of the Cotswold Way, which acquired National Trail status in 2007, and he was also an active member of the Youth Hostel Association. In 2001 he was awarded an MBE for Services to rights of way.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tony Drake", "response": ["*Tony Drake (hiker) (1923\u20132012), British hiker and rambler"]}, {"page": "Tony Drake (Antony John Drake MBE)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Drake (hiker)"]}]}}
