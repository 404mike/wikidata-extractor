Crome contributed 22 works to its first exhibition, held in 1805. He served as President of the Society several times and held the position at the time of his death. With the exception of the times when he made short visits to London, he had little or no communication with the great artists of his own time. He exhibited 13 works at the Royal Academy between 1806 and 1818. He visited Paris in 1814, following the defeat of Napoleon, and later exhibited views of Paris, Boulogne, and Ostend. Most of his subjects were of scenes in Norfolk."]}, {"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["*Robert Dixon"]}, {"page": "Robert Dixon", "response": ["==Robert Dixon==", "* Robert Dixon (clergyman) (1614-1688), English clergyman", "* Robert Dixon (1780\u20131815), English landscape artist", "* Robert Dixon (character), fictional character in Australian TV series Sea Patrol", "* Robert Dixon (explorer) (1800\u20131858), Australian explorer", "* Robert Dixon (mathematician) (born 1947), British mathematician and graphic artist", "* Robert Dixon-Smith, Baron Dixon-Smith (born 1934), British peer and Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "Robert Ladbrooke", "response": ["In 1803 Ladbrooke and Crome formed the Norwich Society of Artists, a group that also included Robert Dixon, Charles Hodgson, Daniel Coppin, James Stark and George Vincent.

Ladbrooke contributed fourteen works to its first exhibition in 1805. In 1808, when Crome became president, Ladbrooke was elected as vice-president. In 1816, Ladbrooke, along with Joseph Stannard, John Thirtle and five other members of the Norfolk Society, having ineffectually urged a modification of some of the rules, seceded from the society, but this venture ultimately failed and was abandoned after three years. Between 1804 and 1815 Ladbrooke was an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy, and until 1822 he exhibited works at the British Institution. He was a successful teacher, and was able to enjoy a long and comfortable retirement."]}, {"page": "John Thirtle", "response": ["Thirtle's earliest known work is his landscape The Windmill (1800), an unusual subject matter for him, as he first exhibited works that were not landscapes, but portraits and paintings of other subjects. By 1806 he had begun to increase his output of landscapes, and to stand out as a master of the genre of watercolour painting. In 1803, Crome and Robert Ladbrooke formed the Norwich Society of Artists, which included Vincent, Charles Hodgson, Daniel Coppin, James Stark and Robert Dixon. Their first exhibition, in 1805, marked the start of the Norwich School of painters, the first British art movement created outside London. Thirtle exhibited five paintings as one of the five featured artists."]}, {"page": "Daniel Coppin", "response": ["In 1803 his friend John Crome and Robert Ladbrooke formed the Norwich Society of Artists, a group that also included Coppin as well as Robert Dixon, Charles Hodgson, James Stark and George Vincent. Their first exhibition, in 1805, marked the start of the Norwich School of painters, the first art movement created outside London. The following year he accompanied Crome and the dealer William Barnes Freeman on a visit to Paris to view the treasures of the Louvre, possible now that the Napoleonic Wars in Europe were at an end. During the visit Crome made sketches and bought works produced by French artists, which the group managed to smuggle back to England. The first exhibition of the Norwich Society, in 1805, marked the start of the Norwich School of Painters. In the exhibition, 223 works were shown by eighteen different exhibitors, including Coppin. Its success inspired the society to stage an exhibition every year, an event which continued until 1833. Coppin contributed regularly to the exhibitions and became President of the Society in 1816."]}, {"page": "Charles Hodgson (artist)", "response": ["In around 1798 Hodgson moved to Norwich and worked as an assistant master at the grammar school.

He had a talent for imitating the artistic style of other artists; the engraving of Thirtle's Devil's Tower\u2014looking towards Carrow Bridge by Lound illustrates his ability as an etcher by the way he conveys the balance of tints and shades in Thirtle's original composition."]}]}}
