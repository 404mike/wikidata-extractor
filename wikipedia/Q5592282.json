Their voices were further processed electronically by Brian Hodgson at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to ring modulation with a 30\u00a0Hz sine wave. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial Revelation of the Daleks, for which the director, Graeme Harper, deliberately used less distortion).", "Although the Daleks are not known for their regard for due process, they have taken at least two enemies back to Skaro for a \"trial\", rather than killing them immediately.

Speaking on how Rose's character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as \"tougher, more independent, and [she] might, at times, seem a little harder\". Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes to remember how the character spoke and acted as she felt she had \"been playing posh birds\" since she left the programme and by contrast \"Rose is a bit of a chav\". Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of \"The Stolen Earth\". Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear \"mystical\" because the characters' reunion was \"the most magical moment\" in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film Blade Runner. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as \"the biggest romance [the viewer] has ever seen\" and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that \"Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2\" because \"she's doing what the plot demands, not what she'd demand\".Davies and Cook, p.326 At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose's dimension hopping and the Dalek's meddling with reality had contaminated her with \"voidstuff\" and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe.Davies and Cook, p.328 In the final episode it is enough for her to stay that the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love.

This included shooting the camera upwards where the gallery lights could be seen - known as \"shooting off set\", something which is forbidden by the BBC. Problems such as this increased as time began to run short and he and producer Nathan-Turner clashed frequently and even executive producer Letts had to step in to advise Joyce. With letters being written to higher executives complaining of Joyce's style of work (also seen as inexperience), Joyce was asked to leave part way through production. His duties were taken up by assistant Graeme Harper, who directed a number of scenes before finally Joyce was re-instated. Setting up of certain shots that Joyce had envisaged proved to take up too much time and shooting over-ran on a number of days.

Howe and Stephen James Walker also were positive, praising the guest stars, and reprinted positive fan reviews from the time. They did note that some viewers may not have liked the Doctor and Peri being sidelined, which could have resulted in the pace seeming slow.

This was followed by a block directed by Graeme Harper comprising \"Trivial Games and Paranoid Pursuits\", \"This Case to be Opened in a Million Years\" and \"In Warm Blood\". Christopher Baker then returned to the director's chair for \"A Double Life\" and \"Other People's Secrets\". Both directors had differing visions for the overall look and feel of the series, with the initial block directed by Baker favouring a pristine, brightly lit approach. This contrasted with the look preferred by Graeme Harper who drastically reduced the light levels (leaving many scenes illuminated only by computer monitor screens) and whose designer, Malcolm Thornton, dressed the sets in a messier and dingier fashion. When Baker returned for his second block of episodes, he sought to return to the brighter, cleaner look which led to some continuity problems. Meanwhile, Evgeny Gridneff and Chris Boucher's professional relationship continued to be stormy with Gridneff deciding to introduce a new Star Cop, Anna Shoun, without consulting Boucher. The cast and crew were well aware of the behind the scenes conflicts and David Calder later recalled that there was \"uncertainty as to which direction this series should go in\". Chris Boucher has been frequently critical of the way in which the series was realised and has since stated that, in retrospect, he wishes he had volunteered to produce the series himself. In response to Boucher's criticisms, Gridneff has said, \"I respect him as a writer and he's professional and, you know, it's his series and if it didn't quite go the way he thought, you know, that's unfortunate when you're dealing, you know, you're losing your baby\".", "The final block was to be directed by Graeme Harper and would comprise the final two episodes \"Death on the Moon\", written by Philip Martin, and \"Information Received\", written by Chris Boucher.

Forced to prioritise and despite the fact that the episode had been cast, costumes made and sets constructed, the decision was taken to drop \"Death on the Moon\" and bring \"Information Received\", now titled \"Little Green Men and Other Martians\", forward.
