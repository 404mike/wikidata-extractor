In a follow\u2013up match against Bradford City, \u00d6hman suffered a concussion and was substituted in the 79th minute, as the club drew 1\u20131. After being sidelined for weeks, he made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Macclesfield Town on 27 August 2019 and started the match, only for the match to be abandoned, due to a heavy rainfall just before half-time left the field waterlogged.

Four days later on 14 September 2019, he scored his first goal for the club, in a 2\u20132 draw against Oldham Athletic. In a follow\u2013up match against Salford City, he suffered a hamstring injury and was sidelined for a month.

However, he spent two months out of the starting line\u2013up, due to his injury concern and strong competitions that saw him placed on the substitute bench. \u00d6hman made his return to the first team, coming on as a 14th-minute substitute for Harry Davis, as Grimsby Town drew 1\u20131 against Leyton Orient on 11 January 2020. Following this, he found himself in and out of the starting line\u2013up for the next eleven matches. However, the 2019\u201320 season came to a premature end, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the club finished fifteenth place.
