He was active as a jockey from 1947 to 1985 and rode a total of 2,810 winners in Britain. Mercer's nickname was \"Smokin' Joe\".\nHe was apprenticed to trainer Frederick Sneyd and won his first British Classic race while still an apprentice on Ambiguity in the 1953 Epsom Oaks. He was British flat racing Champion Apprentice twice, in 1952 and 1953.\nHe subsequently worked as stable jockey for Jack Colling, Dick Hern, Henry Cecil and Peter Walwyn. During his spell at Cecil's yard he won his only British flat racing Champion Jockey's title in 1979. The most successful horse Mercer rode during his career was Brigadier Gerard, winner of 17 of his 18 races between 1970 and 1972. He won every British Classic except the Derby, although he was runner-up twice.He retired as a jockey in November 1985. He then worked initially as a jockey's agent before accepting a job as racing manager for Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 1987. He retired from that in January 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing", "response": ["|Lester Piggott, Joe Mercer", "|Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "2000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "St Leger Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Irish Derby", "response": ["| width=140px | Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Henry Cecil", "response": ["Among the jockeys to ride for Cecil, the most notable have been Steve Cauthen, Lester Piggott, Joe Mercer, Kieren Fallon, Pat Eddery and, later, Tom Queally."]}, {"page": "Brigadier Gerard (horse)", "response": ["Brigadier Gerard was trained during his racing career by Major Dick Hern and ridden in all his races by Joe Mercer.", "Brigadier Gerard began his two-year-old career on 24 June 1970 in the Berkshire Stakes at Newbury. The Berkshire Stakes, run over five furlongs and worth \u00a31201 to the winner, drew a field of five runners. The odds-on favourite Young and Foolish was the comfortable winner of a big field Newmarket maiden and was second on his only other start to the subsequent winner of the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot. The only other fancied runner was Mais\u2018y Dotes winner of four from her six starts in modest company. Brigadier Gerard was ridden by Joe Mercer and was relatively unfancied at odds of 100/7.", "After a slow early pace Joe Mercer allowed Brigadier Gerard to stride into the lead where he drew steadily clear winning easing down by three lengths from Mummy's Pet with Swing Easy a further half a length away in third place.", "In the race, My Swallow made the early running from Mill Reef until they came together, three furlongs from home. At this time Joe Mercer, on Brigadier Gerard, picked up his stick to ask him to close the two-length gap, but neither Geoff Lewis, on Mill Reef, nor Frankie Durr, on My Swallow, had yet made any comparable move. Then, with under three furlongs left to run, Brigadier Gerard drew level with Mill Reef. Brigadier Gerard strode away to win by three lengths.", "Brigadier Gerard's jockey Joe Mercer:", "Joe Mercer allowed Brigadier Gerard to stroll along at the head of affairs until approaching the furlong maker, where Faraway Son and Joshua threw down their challenges. Brigadier Gerard pulled away to win by 5 lengths from Faraway Son, with the finishing time two seconds outside the record.", "Then came his loss in the Benson & Hedges Gold Cup run over an extended mile and a quarter at York. Brigadier Gerard (starting at 1/3) raced against the 1972 Epsom Derby winner Roberto and the runner-up, Rheingold, who started second favourite. Roberto had run poorly in his previous race, the Irish Derby, but, ridden by the Panamanian jockey Braulio Baeza, ran the race of his life with a front-running display, which shattered the course record, to defeat Brigadier Gerard by three lengths. There was a gap of ten lengths back to Gold Rod, who beat Rheingold for third. According to Joe Mercer, his horse was sick: \"... when they got back to the stables and the horse put his head down, the mucus poured out of him. He was sick, yet he was still able to run second to the Derby winner, giving him 12 pounds.\"Daily Telegraph, 15 August 2012, page S18. The theory that Brigadier Gerard was a sick horse and ran below form against Roberto does not bear factual scrutiny; neither his trainer nor owner offered this as an excuse and his official 10 lengths defeat of the third horse, Gold Rod, was on a par with his best form. As his owner, John Hislop, acknowledged, re-examination of the race film showed that he actually beat Gold Rod by 17 lengths and also broke the course record.Hislop, John (1973). The Brigadier. Martin Secker and Warburg, . Thus the Brigadier may have run his best ever race in defeat."]}, {"page": "Gordon Richards (jockey)", "response": ["He also trained for Lady Beaverbrook when she took up her interest in racing. An early owner was Dorothy Paget and when she died he was an influence in Sobell and Weinstock purchasing her stud (Ballymacoll Stud), breeding and racing stock. Training first at Ogbourne in Wiltshire and then at Whitsbury Stables in Hampshire, he sent out many winners and his best horse was the Sobell/Weinstock owned Reform. This colt won 11 of his 14 starts and his victories included: The Champion Stakes, St James Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. In addition he trained good horses such as: Sunny Cove, Dart Board, Greengage and Pipe of Peace. His stable jockey for much of his training career was Scobie Breasley and when he retired Edward Hide took over. At the end of the 1970 season he was forced to retire from training. The details were that William Hill wished to restart his breeding operation from Whitsbury (which he leased to Richards). Sobell/Weinstock negotiated to buy West Ilsley Stables from Jakie Astor, but a stipulation of the purchase was that incumbent trainer, Dick Hern, and stable jockey, Joe Mercer, remained in place at West Ilsley."]}, {"page": "Lockinge Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Coronation Cup", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "1000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Epsom Oaks", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "St James's Palace Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Queen Anne Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Prince of Wales's Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Ascot Gold Cup", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Coronation Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Diamond Jubilee Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Eclipse Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Sussex Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Nassau Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Oaks", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Fillies' Mile", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth II Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Middle Park Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Dewhurst Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Champion Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Vertem Futurity Trophy", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Duke of York Stakes", "response": ["| width=160px | Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Dante Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Henry II Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "King Edward VII Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Duchess of Cambridge Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "July Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Richmond Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Vintage Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Goodwood Cup", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Great Voltigeur Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Gimcrack Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Lowther Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Celebration Mile", "response": ["* Joe Mercer \u2013 Brigadier Gerard (1971), Sallust (1972), Captain James (1978), Kris (1979)", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Park Hill Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Doncaster Cup", "response": ["* Joe Mercer \u2013 Nick La Rocca (1953, dead-heat), Grey of Falloden (1964), The Accuser (1968), Biskrah (1972), Sea Anchor (1976), Buckskin (1978), Le Moss (1979, 1980)", "| Charlie ElliottJoe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "May Hill Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Royal Lodge Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Challenge Stakes (Great Britain)", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Rockfel Stakes", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Cup (horse race)", "response": ["| Joe Mercer", "| Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "List of jockeys", "response": ["* Joe Mercer"]}, {"page": "Irish 2,000 Guineas", "response": ["| Joe Mercer"]}]}}
