Lavety was part of TeamBath, the team who became the first university side to qualify for the FA Cup proper for 122 years. He also had spells with Clydebank, Pollok, KR Reykjavik of Iceland and with Des Moines Menace in America before his return to St Mirren. He had been on trial at Love Street in the summer of 2003, and scored against Gretna before signing for two years on a part-time deal. When Gus MacPherson took over the managers job he appeared looking fitter and the magic moment finally came against Airdrie United in the Scottish Cup, when he hit a low 25-yard shot past the Airdrie goalkeeper for his only goal of the season so far. That goal took him past former Saint Mark Yardley in the post-war scorer's chart, but it was his last in Saints colours. His final game came against Ayr United towards the end of the season, and Lavety helped the side overcome a 0\u20131 deficit, which was turned into a 4\u20131 victory."]}, {"page": "Livingston United F.C.", "response": ["* Mark Yardley"]}]}}
