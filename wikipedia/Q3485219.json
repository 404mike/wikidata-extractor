Sir Joseph Robinson, 1st Baronet surveyed mining claims on Langlaagte Farm where gold would first be found, and he also inspected the 600 plots that made up the spoil tip Randjeslaagte, the seed of Johannesburg, with the help of W.H.A. Pritchard between October 19 and November 3, 1886. The streets ran north to south and east to west artificially, with no regard to terrain, and were quite broad, countering the Transvaal government's expectation of a mere mining hamlet similar to Barberton or Pilgrim's Rest. His goal was to offer as many housing plots as possible to save money, while selling the corners as valuable business offices."]}, {"page": "List of baronetcies conferred upon British expatriates and non-British nationals", "response": ["* Sir Joseph Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Hawthornden, in the Cape Province, and Dudley House, in Westminster (1908), extant"]}]}}
