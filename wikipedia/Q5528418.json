This decision was ratified in 2009 when the World Squash Federation confirmed the switch to the PARS 11 scoring system. Since that time, almost all professional and league games have been played according to PARS to 11. One of the reasons for switching to PARS was that long, taxing matches became less frequent and promoters could more easily predict match and session length. Gawain Briars, who served as the Executive Director of the Professional Squash Association when the body decided to switch to PARS in 2004 hoped that PARS would make the \"professional game more exciting to watch, [and] then more people will become involved in the game and our chances of Olympic entry may be enhanced.\""]}, {"page": "World Squash Championships", "response": ["|  Glen Brumby Gawain Briars"]}, {"page": "Gresham's School", "response": ["An Old Greshamian, Richard Leman, was a member of the gold medal-winning British hockey squad at the 1988 Summer Olympics and of the bronze medal-winning team at the 1984 Summer Olympics.
