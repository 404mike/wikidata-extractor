Davies (born John Ross Twiston Davies; 20 March 1927 \u2013 25 May 2004) was an English audio engineer, who specialised in restoring classic jazz records. He was also a working musician and a member of The Temperance Seven.\nDavies was born in Wivelsfield, Sussex, England, the son of a dermatologist. He was also a trombonist, trumpeter and alto saxophonist. In the early 1950s, he was a member of the Crane River Jazz Band led by Ken Colyer which spearheaded interest in the original New Orleans jazz style. Later he achieved chart success with the 1960s jazz revival band The Temperance Seven. The group's recording of \"You're Driving Me Crazy\" reached the top of the UK Singles Chart in 1961. One of his eccentricities, captured in old photographs, was to wear a fez.\nFor many he was considered \"the world's leading specialist in the art of sound restoration\", specifically in regard to jazz and blues existing on pre-magnetic tape media such as shellac 78s. He was particularly interested in recordings from 1917 to 1940.Davies developed many methods for restoring old recordings and disliked modern techniques for removing surface noise. While he appreciated attempts to 'clean up' recordings and to create new versions of old recordings for modern audiences (e.g. the stereophonic remastered recordings by Robert Parker), in general he said he preferred remasterings which \"keep everything and do as little as possible\" to the original recording, and thought the remastering engineer should \"Add nothing, take nothing away\". The presence of his name on the credit of a reissue is generally considered the mark of a quality product. \nHe started his own record label called \"Ristic\" (after his childhood nickname) in the late 1940s which produced reissued recordings from 1949 to 1972.Davies was always generous with his time and his collection and wanted it to be available for other people to use for research and reissues after his death. The Borthwick Archive at York University have accepted the entire collection  and are housing it in ideal conditions, and making a transfer suite available so that his wish can be carried out. Information about the collection collated from the collection catalogue is also now available online from the University of York Digital Library, and a small selection of the tracks have been made available to listen to online.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bessie Smith", "response": ["Given those historic limitations, the current digitally remastered versions of her work deliver significant improvements in the sound quality of Smith's performances.

He made an album with John R. T. Davies in 1985 and began working with Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham's Sweet Baby Blues Band in 1984. Noone made five albums with The Cheathams and taught jazz in the San Diego public school system from 1967 to 1984.

Music critic Cub Koda, writing for Allmusic, notes that \"Although this material has been around the block several times before -- and continues to be available in packages greatly varying in transfer quality -- this is truly the way to go, and certainly the most deluxe packaging this material has ever received with the greatest sound retrieval yet employed.\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz included Hot Fives & Sevens in its \"Core Collection,\" and assigned its \"crown\" accolade to the album, along with a four-star rating (of a possible four stars).  (The first three discs from this set, JSP CD 312 \u2013 314, individually received four-star ratings, and are also included in the Core Collection.)  Penguin editors Richard Cook and Brian Morton remarked, \"John R. T. Davies's remastering for JSP is superlative.  Armstrong scholars argue over whether the Columbia 'definitive' edition \u2013 mystifyingly delayed \u2013 is superior, but it's hard to see anyone being disappointed with either.\"  2008's Jazz : The Basics is not as effusive, suggesting that other remasters may sound better and other packaging may be more complete, but the lower price of this set made it \"an attractive package for recordings that are a necessary part of any CD collection.\" Ben Ratliff, by contrast, found the collection only a \"tolerable alternative to Columbia's muffled-sounding initial CD reissue\", but preferred Columbia Legacy's The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings (C4K 63257) for its greater \"bright and present\" sound."]}, {"page": "List of record collectors", "response": ["* John R.
