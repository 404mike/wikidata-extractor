It started as a model of syntax, whose most distinctive characteristic is its use of dependency grammar, an approach to syntax in which the sentence's structure is almost entirely contained in the information about individual words, and syntax is seen as consisting primarily of principles for combining words. The central syntactic relation is that of dependency between words; constituent structure is not recognized except in the special case of coordinate structures.", "* Language Networks: The New Word Grammar, Richard Hudson, 2007 "]}, {"page": "Loughborough Grammar School", "response": ["* Richard Hudson (born 1939), linguist."]}, {"page": "English auxiliary verbs", "response": ["Various linguists, including Geoff Pullum, Paul Postal and Richard Hudson, and Robert Fiengohas have suggested that to in cases like I want to go (not the preposition to) is a special case of an auxiliary verb with a no tensed forms.
