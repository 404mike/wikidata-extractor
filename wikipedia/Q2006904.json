With MKvsDC and the 2011 reboot, Kano was given a full head of hair and beard, and a cosmetic addition in the reboot was two large solid-black dragon tattoos that started at his chest and snaked around his arms, while his outfits in both games were throwbacks to the two-dimensional titles. The character was originally depicted as an expediate American, until his nationality was retconned as Australian after English actor Trevor Goddard portrayed him in the first Mortal Kombat film. Although Goddard used a Cockney accent for the character, his depiction was misinterpreted as Australian, which would become the basis for the character in subsequent games.", "In the 1995 Mortal Kombat movie, Kano was played by English actor Trevor Goddard. The film expanded upon Kano's rivalry with Sonya from the games; she now sought vengeance against Kano for killing her (unnamed) partner. Shang Tsung hires Kano to lure Sonya into the Mortal Kombat tournament, promising to reward Kano's efforts after he presumably defeats Sonya, while demanding that she is \"not to be harmed, only humiliated\". Kano baits Sonya into boarding Shang Tsung's ship, and is later spotted by Cage, Sonya and Liu Kang conversing with Goro. When Sonya and Kano meet in battle, his earlier plan with Shang Tsung goes astray when he is defeated, and Shang Tsung goads Sonya into finishing him; she complies by breaking his neck. Kano is described as wearing a business suit during the dining scene in the movie novelization, which also features a detailed opening scene of an unsuccessful joint mission of arresting Black Dragon members by the Special Forces and an international task force, which culminates in Kano killing the task force's lieutenant, who is designated therein as Sonya's murdered partner.Delrio, Martin. Mortal Kombat. Tor Books (1995). . Kano is spared by Sonya in their fight, as she refuses to fall prey to Shang Tsung's scheme while declaring that nobody \"owned\" her, and at the end of the book, he is captured and handcuffed by Sonya. Kano's wardrobe is minimalist in the film, as his game design was eschewed in favor of the character going shirtless with a simple brown vest, while he wears only a pair of pinstriped slacks, a metal choker and combat boots when he fights Sonya. The companion book published by Prima Lifestyles prior to the film's release said in his character profile: \"A strapping English man talented in all forms of martial arts, he's particularly skilled with a knife. He seems to enjoy his cat-and-mouse game with Sonya, which began after he murdered her partner.\"", "Kano placed 24th in UGO.com's 2012 selection of the series' top fifty characters, and the site had additionally ranked him in 2011 as the seventh best cyborg character of all time, ahead of RoboCop and Star Trek character Seven of Nine.K. Thor Jensen, Best Cyborgs Of All Time , UGO, September 15, 2011 Den of Geek placed him seventeenth in their 2015 ranking of the series' characters, commenting that \"Kano is a special kind of scum, and the series is better for him existing ... [but] he probably wouldn\u2019t rank quite as high if not for Trevor Goddard\u2019s rocking performance in the first movie.\" Josh Wirtanen of Cheat Code Central listed Kano as the fifth best Mortal Kombat character while Game Revolution's Anthony Severino included in his 2011 \"Top 10 Old School Mortal Kombat Characters\" feature.
