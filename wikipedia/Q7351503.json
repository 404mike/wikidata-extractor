The windows originally contained the names and arms of benefactors who contributed to the renovation of the chapel after its purchase by the city and the imperial crown of Edward VI, but by the 19th century many had been lost. Blomefield's History of the County of Norfolk, compiled in the 18th century, identifies the coat of arms of the Drapers, Grocers, and St George's arms; with the family arms of the Palmers, Symbarbs and the Ruggs. Following renovations carried out in 1937\u201340 six windows contain stained glass panels mainly depicting shields. Among those that can be seen today are the coat of arms of the Worshipful Company of Dyers, and a shield carrying the Latin motto  which literally translates to \"Fame is equal to the toil\". The motto, which comes from the Satires of Horace, has been taken out of context as in the poem Horace explains that fame never corresponds to the effort one has made. The art historian Eric Fernie suggests the style of the chapel is firmly within the palatial tradition of two-storey chapels along with the Palatine Chapel, Aachen, La Sainte-Chapelle and the Royal Chapel of St Stephen. In contrast archaeologist Roberta Gilchrist suggests that the design was influenced by the \"visual culture of medieval death\", its architecture holding additional iconographic meaning connected to its use for storage of charnel. The old charnel house is a scheduled monument and the chapel above is a Grade I listed building."]}, {"page": "The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic", "response": ["The influential nature of Merrifield's work was also recognised by the medieval archaeologist Roberta Gilchrist of the University of Reading. In an academic paper published in a 2008 edition of the Medieval Archaeology journal, Gilchrist referenced Merrifield's study, noting that it offered a \"rare contribution\" to the archaeology of ritual and magic in Britain. In particular she highlighted his belief that many archaeologists dealing with literate cultures exhibited a \"ritual phobia\" as accurate.Gilchrist 2008. p. 119."]}, {"page": "Ralph Merrifield", "response": ["During his retirement he continued to take an active role in researching London's past. In 1983 he published London: City of the Romans, in which he updated his account of Londinium with information obtained over the previous decade and a half. His book The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic appeared in 1987, and was written to combat what Merrifield identified as a widespread neglect of ritual aspects in the archaeological record. Concurring with Merrifield's assessment about this neglect, the later archaeologist Roberta Gilchrist described the book as a \"rare contribution\" to the discipline. The historian of religion Hilda Ellis Davidson praised the \"cautious and balanced arguments\" of Merrifield's work, opining that it should be read by every archaeologist as a corrective to what she thought was their widespread ignorance of folklore.", "Merrifield came to be known as the \"father of London's modern archaeology\", the archaeologist Harvey Sheldon describing him as the \"father figure\" of London archaeology. According to archaeologist W. F. Grimes, it was Merrifield's \"work in and about London [that earned him] an honoured place in British Archaeology\". In Ronald Hutton's introduction for Physical Evidence for Ritual Acts, Sorcery and Witchcraft in Christian Britain, edited by him and published in 2016, he referenced a work from 2012 by Roberta Gilchrist, who noted then \"a stubborn reluctance to address [the] phenomenon [of ritual and magic] in relation to later medieval archaeology\". Hutton noted further that, \"when a top-ranking scholar like Gilchrist expresses concern about an issue, that is a sign in itself that it is emerging into greater prominence.\" In 2014, the Society for Historical Archaeology's journal Historical Archaeology published an issue mainly comprising papers presented to a symposium held in 2012 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, on the topic \"Manifestations of magic: The archaeology and material culture of folk religion\". In an introductory paper a guest editor, M. Chris Manning, described The Archaeology of Ritual and Magic as \"seminal\", and wrote that \"[m]any of the participants'\u00a0... research [had] been informed by Merrifield's work\". However, the \"volume edited by\u00a0... Hutton [in 2016] was the first [book] to cover similar ground in twenty-eight years.\""]}, {"page": "Medieval Archaeology", "response": ["*2008: Roberta Gilchrist, \"Magic for the Dead?
