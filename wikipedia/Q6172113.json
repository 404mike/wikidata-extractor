They were anti-imperialist in their political outlook and worked with Sri Lankan activists to assist the colony in achieving independence from British colonial rule. The group held a disproportionate amount of influence relative to their size, and most were radical activists in their home countries who had married Sri Lankan activists and revolutionary politicians; being active in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, the Communist Party of Sri Lanka and the Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party. Several attempts were made at deporting them by the colonial government, most notably the Australian ex-planter Mark Anthony Bracegirdle, along with Rhoda Miller de Silva, Jeanne Hoban Moonesinghe and Maud Keuneman. Other notable European Radicals included Doreen Young Wickremasinghe, who became a MP, Edith Gy\u00f6mr\u0151i Ludowyk and Hedi Keuneman."]}, {"page": "Vivienne Goonewardene", "response": ["In India, Vivienne immersed herself in the Quit India Movement, a movement with the demand to end the British Rule of India.

Prior to this development, but setting the scene for it, the group experienced something of a change over of leading figures from 1952 to 1954. Most importantly of all Tony Cliff was permitted to return to London from his exile in Dublin and for the first time was able to function as an active leader of the group rather than through others or during visits to his family. Cliff's centrality to the group cannot be overemphasized in these years as his wife, Chanie Rosenberg, was also an active member and in September 1952 Michael Kidron, Cliff's brother-in-law, travelled to Britain from Israel. Kidron would later recruit Seymour Papert, later to become an important pioneer in the field of computers, who would also play a considerable role in the SRG. Others joining at this time were Stan Newens, later a Labour MP, and Bernard Dix, later prominent in the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE). Significantly, as the group was renewed by such new recruits it lost some of its earlier character as figures like Bill Ainsworth, Ken Tarbuck, later to pass through a number of left groups, and Duncan Hallas left, while Anil Moonesinghe and his wife Jeanne Hoban left for Ceylon where the former would eventually become a Minister. Duncan Hallas alone would return 14 years later and again play a leading role in what was by then the International Socialists."]}, {"page": "Hoban", "response": ["*Jeanne Hoban (1924\u20131997), British political activist"]}, {"page": "List of people from Kent", "response": ["*Jeanne Hoban (born 1924) \u2013 trade unionist in Sri Lanka"]}, {"page": "History of the Jews in Sri Lanka", "response": ["* Jeanne Hoban Moonesinghe, British-born journalist, Trade Unionist and Trotskyist (Jewish maternal grandfather)"]}, {"page": "Douglas Walatara", "response": ["A popular Sri Lankan Newspaper, the Sunday Times, describes Dr Walatara as having performed with much distinction, the task of educating teachers in the South Asian country.
