They called the company Jewels and Stone (Jewels as in Jules, an abbreviation of Julian, and Stone from Barry Stone's surname).\nAs well as remixing songs such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor's \"Murder on the Dancefloor\", Boyzone's \"No Matter What\" and S Club 7's \"Don't Stop Movin'\", the duo are credited with writing and producing the Adam Rickitt hit \"I Breathe Again\", which reached number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in 1999, the S Club Juniors (later S Club 8) single \"Automatic High\", which reached number 2 in the same chart and Rachel Stevens' \"I Said Never Again (But Here We Are)\".\nThe pair also collaborated with Hear\u2019Say and Five. Their most internationally recognised achievement was composing the theme music for the British TV talent show, Pop Idol with Cathy Dennis. The same music was used as the theme to its U.S. equivalent, American Idol, and other versions of the same show around the world. They were honoured at the 26th Annual Film & Television Music Awards by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers for this music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Let's Get to It", "response": ["*Julian Gingell \u2013 keyboards"]}, {"page": "Come and Get It (Rachel Stevens album)", "response": ["* Keyboards \u2013 David Eriksen, Julian Gingell, Brian Higgins, Eliott James, Damian LeGassick, Tim Powell, Paul Statham, Barry Stone and Anders Wollbeck"]}, {"page": "I Said Never Again (But Here We Are)", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Julian Gingell"]}, {"page": "Julian gingell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Julian Gingell "]}, {"page": "Gingell", "response": ["* Julian Gingell (born 1969), songwriter and record producer"]}, {"page": "If I Have to Stand Alone", "response": ["*Julian Gingell \u2013 assistant engineer"]}, {"page": "Tangled Up (Girls Aloud album)", "response": ["In addition to the album, Girls Aloud and Fascination teamed up with Julian Gingell and Barry Stone\u2014under the pseudonym Jewels & Stone\u2014to produce a limited edition remix album.

Despite the collection featuring eight remixed tracks, Mixed Up only features one recording from Tangled Up; this was \"Sexy! No No No...\", which was edited and remixed by Tony Lamezma, whilst the remaining content comes from the group's previous singles.
