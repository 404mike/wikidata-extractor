Mascall expressed the view that \"[T]he entry upon the supernatural realm which is bestowed by incorporation into Christ and which is fittingly described as a new birth is also a deliverance from the realm of fallen human nature - the sphere in which man lies under the curse of original sin - and an insertion into the realm of the perfect manhood of Christ. Mascall explains that \"The grace of incorporation into Christ, the normal channel of which is baptism, is a supernatural fact in the ontological order which does not of itself immediately produce physical and moral effects; but it does produce such effects mediately and progressively when, and to the degree in which, the soul co-operates with this grace and surrenders itself to its influence.\" The work of the Holy Spirit in Baptism has been emphasized by several theologians. Richard A. Norris has said that \"Forgiveness of sins and incorporation into Christ ... are only made possible for people by the action of the Holy Spirit. It is the Spirit who ... is God working within people to connect them with Christ and thus to set them in their proper relation with the Father. Baptism, consequently, has always been understood as a sacrament which signifies the gift of the Holy Spirit. Geoffrey W. Bromiley, an evangelical Anglican theologian, has written, \"Baptism as identification with Christ is the sacrament of the regenerative work of the Holy Spirit, not of my consciousness and confession of faith. It is the sign of faith only as this is itself the work of the primary and sovereign divine operation.\" And Anglican theologian and bishop Hugh Montefiore says that \"Baptism is efficacious if it is asked for in faith, in the sense that it enacts sacramentally what has been begun spiritually, and the very fact that it is an outward and visible sign both strengthens the faith of the baptized and is a public witness to that faith.\""]}, {"page": "List of Old Rugbeians", "response": ["* Hugh Montefiore, Bishop of Kingston 1970\u20131978 and Bishop of Birmingham 1977\u20131987"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Kingston", "response": ["|align=\"center\"| 1970 ||align=\"center\"| 1978 || Hugh Montefiore || Translated to Birmingham "]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people in religion", "response": ["| Hugh Montefiore "]}, {"page": "Noel Hudson", "response": ["At the end of the war, Hudson went to Westcott House, Cambridge, then to Leeds Clergy School, and in 1921 began his ordained ministry in the parish of Christ Church, Leeds.
