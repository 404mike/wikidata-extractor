Carrick was commented on as having a strong and forthright personality and a good sense of humour which made him a popular and highly influential figure at the Royal Scottish Academy.  He was never formally trained as a teacher but seems to have been a natural, who could instil in his students his own enthusiasm and love for his subject.  In this role he helped to create a new generation of Scottish sculptors and was very influential, especially in his encouragement of the craft of carving.  His students included Phyllis Bone, a near contemporary and lifelong friend who gained an international reputation as an animal sculptor, and the Art Deco potter Emma Smith Gillies.  The headmaster of Wick Academy brought his son, Scott Sutherland, to Edinburgh to discuss his son's ambitions to become a sculptor.  Carrick reassured the concerned father and Scott soon began his studies in Edinburgh, which would establish him in a long career, producing many acclaimed works, the most famous being the Commando Memorial at Spean Bridge.  An unemployed ship's carpenter from Leith named Tom Whalen wandered into one of Carrick's evening classes after spending years whittling away on pieces of scrap wood.  Carrick immediately recognised his potential, and Whalen became one of the leading artists of the post war period in Scotland.  Hew Lorimer, son of the famous architect Sir Robert Lorimer, was one of Carrick's students and became an established artist, producing many ecclesiastical works including 'Our Lady of the Isles' on South Uist.  Carrick's influence arguably ensured that sculpture retained its status and prestige within the Academy, for example by travelling to Paris in 1938 and persuading the leading French sculptors of the period to travel to Edinburgh for a special exhibition of French sculpture in 1939."]}, {"page": "Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design", "response": ["* Scott Sutherland"]}, {"page": "List of The Minus 5 members", "response": ["* Scott Sutherland"]}, {"page": "HMS Cochrane", "response": ["* was the Rosyth naval base commissioned in 1938.
