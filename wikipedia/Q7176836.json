So far, three modes have been conceptualized. Mode 1 production of knowledge is knowledge production motivated by scientific knowledge alone (basic research) which is not primarily concerned by the applicability of its findings. Mode 1 is founded on a conceptualization of science as separated into discrete disciplines (e.g., a biologist does not bother about chemistry). Mode 2 was coined in 1994 in juxtaposition to Mode 1 by Michael Gibbons, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, Simon Schwartzman, Peter Scott and Martin Trow. In Mode 2, multidisciplinary teams are brought together for short periods of time to work on specific problems in the real world for knowledge production (applied research) in the knowledge society. Mode 2 can be explained by the way research funds are distributed among scientists and how scientists focus on obtaining these funds in terms of five basic features: knowledge produced in the context of application;  transdisciplinarity;  heterogeneity and organizational diversity;  social accountability and reflexivity;  and quality control.  Subsequently, Carayannis and Campbell described a Mode 3 knowledge in 2006.", "Gibbons and colleagues argued that a new form of knowledge production began emerging in the mid-20th century that was context-driven, problem-focused and interdisciplinary. It involved multidisciplinary teams that worked together for short periods of time on specific problems in the real world. Gibbons and his colleagues labelled this \"Mode 2\" knowledge production. He and his colleagues distinguished this from traditional research, labelled 'Mode 1', which is academic, investigator-initiated and discipline-based knowledge production. In support, Limoges  wrote, \"We now speak of 'context-driven' research, meaning 'research carried out in a context of application, arising from the very work of problem solving and not governed by the paradigms of traditional disciplines of knowledge.\" John Ziman drew a similar distinction between academic science and post-academic science, and in 2001 Helga Nowotny, Peter Scott and Michael Gibbons extended their analysis to the implications of Mode 2 knowledge production for society."]}, {"page": "Peter Scott (disambiguation)", "response": ["Peter Scott (1909\u20131989) was a British ornithologist, conservationist, painter and sportsman.", "Peter Scott may also refer to:", "* Peter Scott (Australian footballer) (born 1931), Australian rules footballer", "* Peter Scott (diplomat), British diplomat, Ambassador to Norway, 1975-77 ", "* Peter Scott (thief) (1931\u20132013), British burglar and thief", "* Peter Scott (educationalist) (born 1946), vice-chancellor of Kingston University", "* Peter Scott (footballer, born 1952), English-born Northern Irish footballer", "* Peter Scott (footballer, born 1963) (born 1963), English footballer for Fulham, Bournemouth and Barnet", "* Peter Scott (cricketer, born 1982), English cricketer", "* Peter Scott (cricketer, born 1912) (1912\u20131944), English cricketer and soldier", "* Peter Scott (canoeist) (born 1973), Australian sprint canoeist", "* Peter Scott (skier) (born 1990), alpine skier from South Africa", "* Peter Scott (field hockey) (born 1997), English field hockey player", "* G.
