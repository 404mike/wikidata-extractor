He participated in 7 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 20 July 1963 in the British Grand Prix, where he retired on Lap 60. He scored no championship points. He was a garage-owner in Brighton, Sussex trading as Empire Cars Ltd. As a privateer he came to Formula One late in life.\nRaby started racing about 1953 and drove an assortment of cars, many with the name \"puddle jumper\" written on the side. He is remembered for the I.E.R. Midget F3 car of 1954. He won the 500 c.c. racing car class in a Cooper at the Brighton Speed Trials in 1955. Raby finished 15th in the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans, sharing a Cooper-Climax T39 with Jack Brabham. He won the first Formula Junior race to be held in Britain, at Brands Hatch on 3 August 1959 driving the one-off Moorland car. On 12 June 1960 he won a heat and finished second overall in the Albi Grand Prix, France, for Formula Junior cars. Later that year he won a Formula Libre race at Mallory Park in a Cooper-Climax F2. On 9 May 1963 he took third place in the non-championship F1 Rome Grand Prix at Vallelunga in a Gilby-B.R.M. V8. At the Solitude Grand Prix he was still running at the end but not classified, and he retired in the Oulton Park Gold Cup.He switched to a Brabham-B.R.M. for 1964 but the car often let him down, non-starting in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. He managed an eighth at Syracuse in the Brabham in 1965, selling the car prior to the Italian Grand Prix that year.As Formula One switched to 3-litres for 1966 Ian Raby opted to race in Formula Two. An F2 Brabham-Ford Lotus twin-cam for 1967 produced an eighth place at Snetterton on 24 March. Another eighth place at Hockenheim in June only highlighted the lack of a de rigueur Cosworth FVA engine. Back at Hockenheim on 9 July, Raby managed fifth place against his more powerful rivals.On 30 July 1967, Ian Raby crashed his Brabham in the Zandvoort Trophy (Grote Prijs van Zandvoort) F2 race and was seriously injured. He succumbed to his injuries on 7 November 1967.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Circuit Zandvoort", "response": ["| Ian Raby || 7 November 1967 || Seriously injured on 5th lap of the Zandvoort Grand Prix, 7th round of the 1967 European Formula 2 Championship."]}, {"page": "Jack Brabham", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Ian Raby"]}, {"page": "Chris Amon", "response": ["!

Greene had lost an arm in a bicycle accident at 16 but went on to compete in many UK speed trials very successfully in the early 1950s. After he stopped competing, he fed his enthusiasm for motor racing by founding a motor racing team named after his company and later constructing the Gilby racing car. The team competed in 12 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, including 6 with cars of their own construction, but scored no World Championship points. The Gilby cars were constructed by Syd Greene for his son Keith to drive, having previously entered a Maserati 250F for Roy Salvadori and Ivor Bueb and also a Cooper for Greene Jr. Keith Greene later became better known as a team manager in Formula One and sports car racing. Gilby made its debut in the 1954 French Grand Prix with the Maserati, for Salvadori, who also drove for the team in  and , and the team's last event was the 1962 Italian Grand Prix. After the team ceased competing in Formula One, the final Gilby car was purchased and entered in three events in , by privateer Ian Raby.
