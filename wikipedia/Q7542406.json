The photos were alleged to show Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers from the Queen's Lancashire Regiment. Within days the photographs were shown to be crude fakes. According to official British sources, the photographs were apparently shot, in North-West England. Under the headline \"SORRY..WE WERE HOAXED\", the Mirror responded that it had fallen victim to a \"calculated and malicious hoax\" and apologised for the publication of the photographs. However, Morgan refused to admit that the photographs were faked, and stated that the abuse shown in the photographs is similar to the sort of abuse that was happening in the British Army in Iraq at the time."]}, {"page": "Manchester Evening News", "response": ["In February 2010, the Manchester Evening News was sold along with GMG's 31 other regional titles to Trinity Mirror, severing the historic link between The Guardian and the Manchester Evening News.

The sale was described by stockbrokers Numis as \"the deal of the decade\" for Sly Bailey, Trinity Mirror's chief executive, while The Guardians Steve Busfield said the sale was indicative of the declining business value of regional media, comparing the sale to that of Johnston Press's acquisition of 53 regional titles including The Yorkshire Post eight years earlier, for \u00a3560m."]}, {"page": "Sly", "response": ["* Sly Bailey (born 1962), British businesswoman"]}, {"page": "Bailey (surname)", "response": ["* Sly Bailey, British newspaper executive"]}, {"page": "Sylvia Grice", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sly Bailey"]}, {"page": "SuperYacht Business", "response": ["In an interview with the Guardian newspaper in 2002 IPC Media's chief executive, Sly Bailey, blamed the economic downturn for a fall in sales in their portfolio of magazines with a focus on luxury brands, such as super yachts."]}, {"page": "Sylvia Bailey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sly Bailey"]}]}}
