And now I'm making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, are going to be 3,000 or 5,000,\" he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: \"I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. They all said, 'Listen dude, if you get this on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, \"It's been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it. There's nothing that can compare to that kind of first-hand experience.\""]}, {"page": "McCune (surname)", "response": ["* Emma McCune (1964\u20131993), British foreign aid worker"]}, {"page": "Riek Machar", "response": ["Machar married Emma McCune, a British aid worker.

Emmanuel was only 11 years old then and McCune insisted he should not be a soldier. She adopted him and smuggled him to Kenya. There Emmanuel attended school in Brookhouse International School in Nairobi. McCune died in a road accident a few months later, but her friends (Madeleine Bunting and Anna Ledgard) helped Emmanuel to continue his studies. However, after McCune died, her husband Machar did not agree with Emmanuel staying with him, and he was forced to live in the slums (maybe before he came to Kileleshwa). He stayed in Kileleshwa with other refugees while attending Arboretum Sixth Form College.", "With the help of a British aid worker (Emma McCune), Jal escaped into Kenya. But even that came with hardships as he lived for years in the slums. But Jal eventually stumbled upon hip-hop and discovered the genre harboured incredible power, both spiritual and political. While studying in Kenya, Jal started singing to ease the pain of what he had experienced. He also became very active in the community, raising money for local street children and refugees. With the encouragement of those around him like Gatkuoth Jal who has also gone through the same experience, Jal became increasingly involved in music and formed several groups. His first single, \"All We Need Is Jesus\", was a hit in Kenya and received airplay in the UK.", "Jal completed a 661-day \"Lose to Win\" fast to build a school in Leer, Southern Sudan, in Emma McCune's honour. From December 2008 to October 2010, the musician ate one meal per day, skipping his breakfasts and lunches to raise funds and awareness for the school, called Emma Academy. "]}, {"page": "SPLA-Nasir", "response": ["The topic of Sudanese support to SPLA-Nasir is highly controversial.  Riek's influential wife Emma McCune denied any such connection and Riek's numerous supporters refused to believe the leaked evidence.  In September 1991, Lam established contact with government representative Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, who funneled money through SPLA-Nasir's Nairobi office.  Similarly, an SPLA-Nasir representative was sent to Khartoum to set up a liaison office, where he met Omar al-Bashir, Hassan al-Turabi and army commanders.  The stance of SPLA-Torit, who were able to monitor government support activities over radio, was that this proved that the coup was entirely a plot of the government.  In an attempt to cause a similar split in the north, Torit forces were put under the command of Daud Bolad and sent to start an insurgency in Darfur, western Sudan.  Sources within SPLA-Nasir present a picture in which the leaders thought they could use government support tactically to quickly overthrow Garang, while maintaining an anti-government strategy.  When the initial coup failed, the Nasir command required more government support and thus was increasingly directed by Khartoum.Johnson, pp. 98-99  In January 1992, the Nasir faction and Khartoum announced an agreement in Frankfurt.  The agreement, which contained no mention of independence for the south, caused two Dinka members of the negotiating delegation to quit in disgust.Johnson, p. 112"]}, {"page": "Tarquin Hall", "response": ["He has also worked in TV news and is a former South Asia bureau chief of Associated Press TV, based in New Delhi.
