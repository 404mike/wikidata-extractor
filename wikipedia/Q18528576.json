Holidaying here from 1855 to 1941 were Robert and Elizabeth Gray and their children; particularly Alice and Edith Gray. The family, led principally by Elizabeth and Alice, created scientifically organised collections of fossils for several museums including the Natural History Museum."]}, {"page": "Thomas Davidson (palaeontologist)", "response": ["Davidson benefited from an introduction to Elizabeth Gray by John Young in 1865. Gray had a lifelong interest in the fossils of Girvan in Scotland. Her family took their holidays there each year and they would devote their time to gathering cleaning and labelling fossils. Gray had some basic geology training, but she preferred to let others do the scientific descriptions. Gray would send collections of fossils, including brachiopoda, regularly over several years between 1867 and 1885."]}, {"page": "List of malacologists", "response": ["*Elizabeth Gray (1831\u20131924) Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Cothurnocystis", "response": ["* C. elizae honors Elizabeth Gray, who collected the specimens upon which the description of this species is based."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Grey", "response": ["Elizabeth Gray or Grey may refer to:", "*Elizabeth Gray (artist) (died 1903), Irish artist", "*Elizabeth Gray (broadcaster), Canadian radio broadcaster", "*Elizabeth Gray (fossil collector) (1831\u20131924), Scottish malacologist", "*Elizabeth Gray Vining (1902\u20131999), born Elizabeth Gray, librarian"]}, {"page": "Cyrtograptus", "response": ["Cyrtograpsus grayianus was brought to a meeting of the Geological Society of Glasgow and its name was suggested to honour Elizabeth Gray, the woman who found it."]}, {"page": "Helminthochiton", "response": ["Helminthochiton grayiae was recognised as the type species for Septemchiton.

Given how neglected her field was, she realized a large-scale taxonomic revision was necessary, and she devoted decades to such a study, published in a series of papers in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society, of which the last installment was published during 1933. She was one of the few experts who could work on the gastropod fossils found by the Scottish fossil collector Elizabeth Gray. Because so few papers have been published on the taxa she studied, her taxonomic work remains relevant to the present day."]}, {"page": "Geological Society of Glasgow", "response": ["* Elizabeth Gray, Scottish fossil hunter, became honorary member in 1900"]}, {"page": "John Young (professor of natural history)", "response": ["He was concurrently the head Keeper of the Hunterian Museum which contained the eclectic gatherings of its founder.
