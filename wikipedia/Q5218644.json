Rudge invented the adjustable ball bearing bicycle hub (British Patent No 526) in 1878.  \nThe French racing cyclist Charles Terront, renowned for winning the first Paris\u2013Brest\u2013Paris event in 1891, used Rudge's axles with much success thereby bringing world attention to Rudge.  In the years before John Dunlop invented the pneumatic tire, Rudge addressed the rough ride by producing a four-bladed, spring-suspended fork in 1887.\n\nAfter Rudge's death, his company was merged with The Tangent & Coventry Tricycle Company to form D. Rudge & Co. which in 1894 became Rudge Whitworth Cycles. By 1911, the Rudge Whitworth Cycle Company was also manufacturing motorcycles.\nAfter the company fell on hard times in the Great Depression, the music company EMI bought the Rudge name.  EMI produced bicycles under the Rudge name from 1935 until 1943 when they sold the name to Raleigh.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of companies named after people", "response": ["* Rudge-Whitworth \u2013 Daniel Rudge"]}, {"page": "Rudge-Whitworth", "response": ["Rudge Whitworth Cycles was a British bicycle, bicycle saddle, motorcycle and sports car wheel manufacturer that resulted from the merger of two bicycle manufacturers in 1894, Whitworth Cycle Co. of Birmingham, founded by Charles Henry Pugh and his two sons Charles Vernon and John,Driver, Hugh.
