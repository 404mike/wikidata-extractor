He demonstrated how the text of the Ulster Cycle of tales, written circa AD 1100, preserves an oral tradition originating some six centuries earlier and reflects Celtic Irish society of the third and fourth century AD. His Celtic Miscellany is a popular standard.\nIn retirement, Jackson continued his work on place-names and Goidelic languages. However he suffered a stroke in 1984 that restricted his work.\nAn obituary was published in The Times on 8 March 1991 and in the journal Nomina.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ulster Cycle", "response": ["Some scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Eugene O'Curry and Kuno Meyer, believed that the stories and characters of the Ulster Cycle were essentially historical; T. F. O'Rahilly was inclined to believe the stories were entirely mythical and the characters euhemerised gods; and Ernst Windisch thought that the cycle, while largely imaginary, contains little genuine myth.T. F. O'Rahilly, Early Irish History and Mythology, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946, pp. 269\u2013271; Cecile O'Rahilly, T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cualnge from the Book of Leinster, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1967, Introduction, p. ix Elements of the tales are reminiscent of classical descriptions of Celtic societies in Gaul, Galatia and Britain. Warriors fight with swords, spears and shields, and ride in two-horse chariots, driven by skilled charioteers drawn from the lower classes.Compare T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge from the Book of Leinster pp. 164\u2013166 with Diodorus Siculus, Historical Library 5.29, Julius Caesar, Commentarii de bello Gallico 4.33 They take and preserve the heads of slain enemies,Compare The Tidings of Conchobar son of Ness \u00a715 with Diodorus Siculus, Historical Library 5.29 and boast of their valour at feasts, with the bravest awarded the curadm\u00edr or \"champion's portion\", the choicest cut of meat.Compare The Story of Mac D\u00e1 Th\u00f3's Pig and Bricriu's Feast with Athenaeus, Deipnosophists 4.40, Diodorus Siculus, Historical Library 5.28 Kings are advised by druids (Old Irish dru\u00ed, plural dru\u00edd), and poets have great power and privilege. These elements led scholars such as Kenneth H. Jackson to conclude that the stories of the Ulster Cycle preserved authentic Celtic traditions from the pre-Christian Iron Age.Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson, The Oldest Irish Tradition: a Window on the Iron Age, Cambridge University Press, 1964 Other scholars have challenged that conclusion, stressing similarities with early medieval Irish society and the influence of classical literature,John T. Koch, \"Windows on the Iron Age\", Ulidia, December Publications, 1994, pp. 229\u2013237; J. P. Mallory, \"The World of C\u00fa Chulainn: The Archaeology of T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge\", Aspects of the T\u00e1in, December Publications, 1992, pp. 103\u2013153 while considering the possibility that the stories may contain genuinely ancient material from oral tradition. J. P. Mallory thus found the archaeological record and linguistic evidence to generally disfavour the presence of Iron Age remnants in the Ulster and Mythological Cycles, but emphasised the links to the Corlea Trackway in the earlier Tochmarc \u00c9ta\u00edne as a notable exception.J. P. Mallory, In Search of the Irish Dreamtime. Thames & Hudson. 2016."]}, {"page": "Connachta", "response": ["In the sagas of the Ulster Cycle, the Connachta, ruled from Cruachan by their king Ailill mac M\u00e1ta and their formidable queen Medb, are the enemies of the Ulaid, ruled from Emain Macha (Navan Fort, County Armagh) by Conchobar mac Nessa, and their wars, notably the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge (cattle raid of Cooley), are the setting for most of the stories. These sagas are traditionally set around the time of Christ, which creates an apparent anachronism: the Connachta are supposedly named after Conn C\u00e9tchathach, who in the usual chronological scheme established by the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, lived in the 2nd century AD.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 331-333 Later texts used the supposedly earlier names of C\u00f3iced Ol nEchmacht (the province of the Fir \u00d3l n\u00c9cmacht, an ancient people of Connacht) and C\u00f3iced Genaind (the province of Genann, a legendary king of the Fir Bolg)Margaret C. Dobs (ed. & trans.), \"La Bataille de Leitir Ruibhe\", Revue Celtique 39, 1922, pp. 1\u201332 for the western province to get around this difficulty. However, the saga tradition is older than the chronological scheme, which is an artificial attempt by Christian monks to synchronise native traditions with classical and biblical history, and it is possible that the Ulster Cycle is based on historical wars between the Ulaid and the Connachta which have been chronologically misplaced.Byrne 2001, p. 50-51.

Jackson estimated that Ulster heroic saga originated in the 4th century.Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson, The Oldest Irish Tradition: a Window on the Iron Age, Cambridge University Press, 1964"]}]}}
