He was recruited by entrepreneur Cyrus West Field as Chief Electrician to work on the pioneering endeavour to lay the first transatlantic telegraph cable for the Atlantic Telegraph Company between western Ireland to eastern Newfoundland. This pioneering project of the Victorian era began in 1854 and was completed in 1858; however the cable functioned for only three weeks. While Whitehouse sent the first telegraph communications in 16 August 1858 to the United States of America, he was ultimately held responsible for the undersea cable failure after he applied higher voltages in an effort to boost declining signals.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin", "response": ["Thomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible\"."]}, {"page": "Whitehouse", "response": ["* Wildman Whitehouse (1816\u20131890), English surgeon and chief electrician for the transatlantic telegraph cable"]}, {"page": "Transatlantic telegraph cable", "response": ["The Atlantic Telegraph Company led by Cyrus West Field constructed the first transatlantic telegraph cable. The project began in 1854 and was completed in 1858. The cable functioned for only three weeks, but was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to President of the United States James Buchanan on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when Wildman Whitehouse applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the cable's faulty manufacture, storage and handling would have caused its premature failure in any case. History of the Transatlantic Cable \u2013 Dr. E.O.W.

The Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed in October 1856 with Brett as president and Field as vice president.  Charles Tilston Bright, who already worked for Brett, was made chief engineer, and Wildman Whitehouse, a medical doctor self-educated in electrical engineering, was appointed chief electrician. Field provided a quarter of the capital himself.Clayton, p. 30 After the remaining shares were sold, largely to existing investors in Brett's company,Kieve, pp. 106\u2013107 an unpaid board of directors was formed which included William Thomson (the future Lord Kelvin), a respected scientist. Thomson also acted as a scientific advisor.

Dispersion, as it relates to transmission lines, is different frequency components of a signal travelling along a line at different speeds.  Early telegraph engineers did not understand frequency analysis of this sort.Lundheim, pp. 24\u201325  The effect of dispersion on a telegraph pulse is to spread it out in time.  This is because a rectangular pulse (as used in telegraphy) has multiple frequency components.  At the receiving end it appears as if part of the pulse has been retarded, hence the term.  The problem this causes for telegraphy is that adjacent pulses smear into each other, an effect called intersymbol interference by modern engineers, and if severe enough the message cannot be read.  It forces the operator to slow the speed of sending so that there is again separation between the pulses.Hunt (2010), pp. 87\u201388  The problem was so bad on the first transatlantic cable in 1858 that transmission speeds were in minutes per word rather than words per minute.  Thinking he could solve the problem by using a higher voltage, telegraph engineer Wildman Whitehouse only succeeded in permanently damaging the cable, making it unusable.  This failure represented a loss of nearly \u00a32\u00a0million (\u00a3\u00a0million in )) for the Atlantic Telegraph Company.Lindey, p. 141"]}, {"page": "Earth-return telegraph", "response": ["The use of earth-return circuits rapidly became the norm, helped along by Steinheil declining to patent the idea \u2013 he wished to make it freely available as a public service on his part.  However, Samuel Morse was not immediately aware of Steinheil's discovery when he installed the first telegraph line in the United States in 1844 using two copper wires.Prescott, p. 272  Earth return became so ubiquitous that some telegraph engineers appear not to have realised that early telegraphs all used return wires.  In 1856, a couple of decades after the introduction of earth return, Samuel Statham of the Gutta Percha Company and Wildman Whitehouse tried to patent a return wire and got as far as provisional protection.Bright in Trotter, p. 516"]}, {"page": "Law of squares", "response": ["One opponent of Thomson was of particular significance, Wildman Whitehouse, who challenged Thomson when he presented the theorem to the British Association in 1855.

He claimed he had experimental evidence that Thomson was wrong, but his measurements were poorly conceived and Thomson refuted his claims, showing that Whitehouse's results were consistent with the law of squares.Lindley, pp. 125\u2013126"]}]}}
