He is a rather pessimistic and hot-headed lad, quick to anger at the slightest provocation, mostly because his girlfriend, Sarah (played by Anna Wilson-Jones), broke his heart and dumped him after an affair with Tim's friend - Duane Benzie (played by Peter Serafinowicz), but he can also be sincerely empathetic and supportive, for example, defending the more timid Brian when Tim feels Brian is being unfairly criticised. He's currently writing and illustrating a graphic novel about an orphaned boy who has been inadvertently transformed into a giant mutant bear from the experiments of the crazed \"Doktor Mandrake\", who now is trying to find this bear so that he can replicate the experiment which transformed the boy. Tim hasn't actually tried selling his work, because he's afraid that people will laugh at both it and him, as shown by flashbacks in-show of an evil-looking man (who is later found to be Damien Knox, editor of Darkstar Comics) laughing at Tim's work. A traumatic incident in his childhood when attempting to cure a fear of dogs merely left him terrified of dogs, lightning and bamboo instead.  He initially works as an assistant manager at a comic book shop, \"Fantasy Bazaar\", alongside its manager/owner, Bilbo Bagshot (played by Bill Bailey). In the second series, he lands his dream job as a graphic artist at Dark Star Comics thanks to Sophie. Tim consistently demonstrates more of a work ethic than Daisy, although his adverse reaction to Twiglets makes him violent. Tim's name is a reference to renowned 2000 AD comic artist, Simon Bisley.", "*Sarah (played by Anna Wilson-Jones): Sarah is the ex-girlfriend who broke Tim's heart by leaving him for his friend, Duane, and kicking him out of their flat. Sarah is a rather cruel person, feeding her own vanity with Tim's humiliating attempts to win her back, while, at the same time, constantly ignoring him. She later wants to reconcile with Tim but he realizes that it is best for him to move on.

Lindsay Duncan plays the Home Secretary Alex Cairns and Alex Macqueen plays Special Agent Callett, whilst Anna Wilson-Jones had the role of Callow's wife Jane. During the casting process, executive producer Annabel Jones was keen to hire non-comedy actors so that a humorous tone could be avoided. Director Otto Bathurst commented that the production's first choice for every role was hired. Callow's political party is not stated, though Brooker says his blue tie implies that he is a member of the Conservative Party, a right-wing party in Britain. Jones commented that it would have been easy to make the audience hate Callow, but the focus was on the public's appetite for humiliation.", "The acting received a positive critical reception, with Goodwin describing the cast as \"high calibre\". Ranking Kinnear as Michael Callow to be the 10th best performance in the Black Mirror franchise, Brian Tallerico of Vulture reviewed that the episode only works due to Kinnear's \"emotional commitment to the character and concept\". Hogan praised Kinnear's acting \"particularly compelling\" in his emotional journey \"from disbelief to dutiful self-sacrifice\". Crace thought his character arc was \"both touching and funny\". Lewis found him \"dignified, stoic and \u2013 crucially \u2013 likeable\", with Goodwin describing him as \"flawed yet entirely sympathetic\". Lindsay Duncan's role, as Callow's press secretary, was also received positively. Crace found her \"understated\" acting \"a delight\", whilst Goodwin praised her \"ruthless\" performance. Goodwin further praised Tom Goodman-Hill in his role of \"the morally malleable face of political spin\" and Anna Wilson-Jones as Callow's wife, for bringing \"grounded emotional connection\" to the episode."]}, {"page": "Victoria (British TV series)", "response": ["* Anna Wilson-Jones as Lady Emma Portman (recurring series 1, main series 2\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "The Stepfather (TV series)", "response": ["* Anna Wilson-Jones as Sasha Munro "]}, {"page": "A Gift from Bob", "response": ["A Gift from Bob (promoted as A Christmas Gift from Bob) is a 2020 British Christmas biographical drama film directed by Charles Martin Smith and written by Garry Jenkins, based on the non-fiction books A Gift from Bob and The Little Book of Bob by James Bowen.
