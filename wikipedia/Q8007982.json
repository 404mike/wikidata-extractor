His performances were known for their polish and subtlety; in more sentimental roles, such as Old Parr, he was able to mix sentiment with cool irony. He was at home in Augustan and other eighteenth century roles, but he is not remembered as a Shakespearian actor. Macready remembered him as justly famous for \"studious correctness\", but described him as second to William Dowton and Joseph Munden in \"the rich quality of humor.\"Macready 130. William Hazlitt praised the conservatism of his style in the older plays. Leigh Hunt disagreed, disparaging Farren in favor of Dowton as Anthony Absolute (Sheridan's The Rivals). Even Hunt, though, acknowledged Farren's exceptional self-possession.Hunt 203. Writing in The Times in 1855, Henry Morley called Farren \"one of the most finished actors by whom the stage has been adorned in the present century.\" Writing after the actor's death, John Westland Marston recalls that the actor excelled in portraying \"the vanity, the self-love, the inconsistency, and now and then the redeeming good-feeling of worldly, well-bred people, and occasionally the credulous faith of simple, guileless people.\"Marston 160."]}, {"page": "Theatre Royal, Drury Lane", "response": ["The comedy actor John Bannister became acting-manager in 1802. With Sheridan's son Tom, and in the circle of Richard Wroughton (stage-manager), William Dowton, Michael Kelly, Tom Dibdin and their likes, he helped to see the Theatre Royal through its next catastrophe.H. van Thal (ed), Solo Recital: The Reminiscences of Michael Kelly, abridged with a Biographical Index (Folio Society, London 1972), pp.\u00a0282\u2013288. On 24 February 1809, despite the previously mentioned fire safety precautions, the theatre burned down. On being encountered drinking a glass of wine in the street while watching the fire, R.B. Sheridan was famously reported to have said: \"A man may surely be allowed to take a glass of wine by his own fireside.\"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, OUP (1999). Michael Kelly (Memoirs, ed. van Thal 1972, p. 283) states that Sheridan was engaged in a debate in the House when the news of the fire came, but although on his behalf it was moved that the House should adjourn, he insisted that 'Public duty ought to precede all private interest' and remained there with Roman fortitude while his theatre burned. Already on the shakiest financial ground, Sheridan was ruined entirely by the loss of the building. He turned to brewer Samuel Whitbread, an old friend, for help.Morning Chronicle, 7 July 1815. As well as investing strongly in the project, Whitbread agreed to head a committee that would manage the company and oversee the rebuilding of the theatre, but asked Sheridan to withdraw from management himself, which he did entirely by 1811."]}, {"page": "Devil among the tailors", "response": ["On 15 August 1805, a play called The Tailors: A Tragedy for Warm Weather, starring William Dowton, was presented at the theatre, then known as The Little Theatre in the Hay.  The London tailors took exception to this satire on their craft, and thousands rioted, both inside and outside the theatre.  The special constables were helpless against the overwhelming odds, so a troop of Life Guards was called.  Sixteen prisoners were taken and the rest dispersed.  The Life Guards did their job so effectively that it was likened to a skittle ball ploughing through the skittles.  Thereafter, the game of Table Skittles (or Bar Skittles) was often referred to as \u2018Devil Amongst the Tailors\u2019 (or Devil Among the Tailors).

From this house he migrated to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he was first seen, 6 October 1813, as Vortex in A Cure for the Heartache. He remained at Drury Lane until his retirement in 1833, filling up his summer vacations at the Haymarket Theatre, the Lyceum and other houses. At Drury Lane, where he was in the receipt of seven pounds a week, he was frequently the substitute for Joseph Shepherd Munden, William Dowton, Daniel Terry and Charles Mathews, to none of whom, however, was he equal in talent. On 21 August 1815 he took the part of the justice of the village in The Maid and the Magpie at the Lyceum Theatre."]}, {"page": "The Castle Spectre", "response": ["The Castle Spectre was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 14 December 1797.

The play had a long run also in the following year and remained in the repertoire until the late 1820s, and was revived until the end of the century.

The actor William Dowton joined her company in 1791 and married her daughter, Sarah, in 1794. Other performers who appeared with Baker in their early careers include Edmund Kean and Thomas Dibdin who were attracted by the offer of regular salaries.Dibdin, 1.91\u20132) As her company became more established Baker was able to attract more famous performers, including Charles Incledon, George Frederick Cooke, Dorothea Jordan and Joseph Grimaldi, the latter of whom appeared with her in Rochester in 1801. In March the following year, Grimaldi worked with Baker in Kent where he performed in a pantomime, which earned him \u00a3300 for two days work.Andrew McConnell Stott, The Pantomime Life of Joseph Grimaldi: Laughter, Madness and the Story of Britain's Greatest Comedian, Canongate Books (2009) \u2013 Google Books Her company's repertoire included several Shakespeare plays: Hamlet, Macbeth, Richard III, As You Like It and The Merchant of Venice were performed at least weekly during the 1780s while comic operas and Dibdin's locally themed The Merry Hop-Pickers, or, Kentish Frolicks were regularly on the bill.", "So that a careful eye could be kept on the takings Baker had each of her theatres designed so that one box office covered all entrances.

A passion for the stage, which had once led him to essay the r\u00f4le of Zanga to William Dowton's Alonzo at the local theatre, was probably the reason of his coming, about 1800, to London, where he obtained employment as a violinist in the orchestra of Covent Garden Theatre, and as a teacher. His talent as a writer of songs and dance music soon brought him more lucrative work, and for nearly a quarter of a century he was regularly engaged by the Theatres Royal to supply music for the light English opera and pantomime then in fashion. But giving way to habits of intemperance he fell into difficulties, and died neglected and penniless in lodgings in St Martin's Lane, on 22 February 1824. He was buried in St Martin's churchyard on the following 28 February, at the expense of two London tradesmen, one of whom was a native of Crediton."]}]}}
