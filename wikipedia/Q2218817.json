His work was originally published as a 16-page pamphlet (1849), and later expanded into a book (1865). \nRowbotham's method, which he called zetetic astronomy, models the Earth as a flat disc centered at the North Pole and bounded along its perimeter by a wall of ice, with the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars moving only several thousand miles above the surface of Earth.", "link_mentions": {}}}
