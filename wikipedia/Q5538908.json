BAC also had a controlling interest in Hunting Aircraft. The parents still had significant aviation interests outside BAC.

These two facilities played a crucial part in the successful development of the 'Upkeep' mine - better known today as the 'bouncing bomb' conceived by Barnes Wallis and deployed to such devastating effect by the 'Dambuster' Avro Lancasters of 617 Squadron, RAF, led by Guy Gibson against Germany's Ruhr Valley reservoirs on the night of 16\u201317 May 1943."]}, {"page": "Vickers Valiant", "response": ["Both Handley-Page and Avro had produced advanced designs for the bomber competition. These would be produced as the Victor and the Vulcan respectively; the Air Staff decided to award contracts to each company as a form of insurance in case one of these designs failed. The submissions became known as the V bombers, or V-class, with the aircraft all being given names that started with the letter \"V\".Downey 1985, p. 5. Vickers' submission had initially been rejected as not being as advanced as the Victor and the Vulcan,Rosemeyer 2009, p. 52. but Vickers' chief designer George Edwards lobbied the Air Ministry on the basis that it would be available much sooner than the competition, going so far as to promise that a prototype would be flown by the end of 1951, that subsequent production aircraft would be flown prior to the end of 1953, and that serial deliveries would commence during early 1955. Gaining the bomber contract was considered of crucial importance to the future of aircraft manufacturing at Vickers. \"Edwards was supremely confident that Weybridge could deliver the aircraft as specified .. \" and \"..committed to the brochure performance figures and dates because he thought they knew how to do it\". He resisted being pushed to try to more closely match the Victor and Vulcan height and speed requirements or to change equipment from that originally specified as these distractions would jeopardize his promised delivery dates.Gardner 2006, p. 92.", "On 18 May 1951, the first prototype, serial number WB210 took to the air for its maiden flight,Andrews and Morgan 1988, p. 439. within the deadline that George Edwards had promised, only 27 months since the contract had been issued. This was several months before the competing Short Sperrin; the Sperrin had straight (not swept) wings and was not ordered.  The Valiant pilot was Captain Joseph \"Mutt\" Summers, who had also been the original test pilot on the Supermarine Spitfire, and wanted to add another \"first\" to his record before he retired. His co-pilot on the first flight was Gabe \"Jock\" Bryce, who succeeded Summers as Vickers' chief test pilot upon his retirement shortly afterwards.Turpin 2002, p. 72.Blackman and Wright 2015, p. 10.McLelland 2013, p. 68. The next month, the Vickers Type 660 was given the official name of \"Valiant\", reusing the name given to the Vickers Type 131 general-purpose biplane of 1931. The name Valiant had been selected by a survey of Vickers employees.Jones 2007, pp. 31, 33.", "The Valiant was based on contemporary aeronautical knowledge with no advanced untried aerodynamics that required proving with scaled-down research aircraft or lengthy research and development. As a result George Edwards described the Valiant appropriately and simply but using his own, mostly original, idiomFrom Bouncing Bombs To Concorde-The Authorised Biography Of Aviation Pioneer Sir George Edwards OM,Robert Gardner 2006,{{ISBN|0 7509 4389 0,p.85 as an \"unfunny\" aircraft. ", "According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Valiant had performed \"extremely well\" during the annual bombing competition hosted by American Strategic Air Command (SAC). American interest in the Valiant resulted in a visit to Vickers by USAF generals Vandenberg, Johnson and LeMay. Vickers test-pilot Brian Trubshaw believed that George Edwards was put under some pressure to build the Boeing B-47 under license. The only result from the visit was Le May's insistence that the Valiant pilot side-by-side seating be incorporated in the B-52 instead of the tandem arrangement in the B-47 and prototype B-52.Brian Trubshaw Test Pilot, Brian Trubshaw and Sally Edmondson, Sutton Publishing Limited 1999, , p.35", "* Gardner, Robert.

The choice of the Mamba engine increased the weight but Vickers made sure the engine nacelle would fit either the Mamba or Dart.Flight 20 November 1947, p. 568. While the Dart progressed better in development, the government asked in August 1947 for the second prototype to be Dart-powered. The second prototype was designated the 630 and was named as the Viscount. The first prototype already under construction was converted to the Dart as a 630 as well.", "The resulting Vickers Type 630 design was completed at Brooklands by chief designer Rex Pierson and his staff in 1945, a 32-seat airliner powered by four Dart engines for a cruising speed of 275\u00a0mph (443\u00a0km/h). An order for two prototypes was placed in March 1946, and construction started in the company's Foxwarren Experimental Department. Originally Viceroy after the viceroy of India, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the aircraft was renamed Viscount following India's independence in 1947.Pigott 2005, p. 125. There was work on replacing the Darts with the Mamba, but this was dropped by the time the prototypes were reaching completion. After Pierson's death in 1948, George Edwards (later Sir George Edwards) took over as chief designer and assumed all technical control over the Viscount project.Gardner 2006, p. 71.", "BEA, and its nationalised successor British Airways (BA), vigorously operated the Viscount on Britain's domestic routes. In the 1980s, British Airways began withdrawing its ageing Viscount fleet; all BA Viscount operations in Scotland had ended in 1982. Former BA aircraft were often sold on to charter operators such as British Air Ferries. Some airlines chose to replace the Viscount with a newer turboprop aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley HS 748.Warner 2005, p. 48.

In addition, the large 'flag carriers' were comparatively wary of the value of jet-powered aircraft, normally opting for comfort and high-quality passenger conditions over speeds.Segreto, Manera and Pohl 2009, pp. 23, 25, 27. This unconventional purchase was also politically controversial; Sir George Edwards, the chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), had expected Britannia to order the rival BAC One-Eleven and lobbied government officials to convince the airline to procure the British airliner instead.
