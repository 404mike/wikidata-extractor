The total of 550 arrests made during the strike was at the time the highest such figure in any industrial dispute since the General Strike of 1926. Journalist Paul Foot described the dispute as \"a central battleground between the classes and between the parties\". The dispute was reported nightly on the national television news, depicting the often violent clashes between the supporters of the strikers and the Metropolitan Police's Special Patrol Group. Grunwick was the first time that this paramilitary police unit had been deployed in an industrial dispute. The mostly female, immigrant, East African Asian strikers \u2013 dubbed \"strikers in saris\" by the news media \u2013 were led by Jayaben Desai, whose membership of the union was later suspended following her hunger strike outside the Trades Union Congress (TUC) headquarters in November 1977. This was also the first dispute where the majority of strikers were from an ethnic minority and still received widespread support from the labour movement \u2013 previous disputes involving immigrant workers which had taken place in Leicester and Southall had \"remained marginalised\" and had even led to \"open and ugly racism on the part of white union members and their leaders\". Reprinted at libcom.org.", "MP Joe Ashton accused the firm of \"exploiting coloured workers\", and writer and political activist Amrit Wilson asserted that Grunwick's management \"made use of the poverty of Asians\" and would turn away non-Asian applicants. Grunwick strikers explained: \"Imagine how humiliating it was for us, particularly for older women, to be working and to overhear the employer saying to a younger, English girl 'you don't want to come and work here, love, we won't be able to pay the sort of wages that'll keep you here' \u2013 while we had to work there because we were trapped.\" Jayaben Desai said: \"The strike is not so much about pay, it is a strike about human dignity.\" The 1977 Scarman Inquiry would ultimately conclude that \"physical working conditions in the company before the strike were good; although the rates of pay were low prior to the strike, the company increased financial benefits paid to workers in November 1976 and April 1977 [until] the rates of pay were broadly comparable with, and in some respects, slightly better than, those paid by comparable firms in the industry... and employees understood and accepted the requirement of compulsory overtime during busy periods.\" A claim by the Socialist Workers Party alleging that Grunwick was a \"racist\" employer was also later withdrawn as \"completely untrue and unfair\". In fact, George Ward was himself of Anglo-Indian extraction born in New Delhi in 1933, the son of a wealthy accountant - although this in itself does not preclude his actions being motivated by institutional racism and the belief that Indian workers should be paid less by virtue of their race.evidence needed", "The strike was sparked by the dismissal of Devshi Bhudia, at the firm's Chapter Road premises, on Friday 20 August 1976 for working too slowly. Three others, Chandrakant Patel, Bharat Patel and Suresh Ruparelia, walked out in support of him. At 6:55pm Jayaben Desai put on her coat to leave and was called into the office, where she was dismissed for doing so. Her son Sunil walked out in support of her. On 23 August 1976 the six began picketing outside Grunwick, and were advised by the Citizens Advice Bureau to contact a trade union to represent them. They were then advised by the TUC to contact APEX, the Association of Professional, Executive, Clerical and Computer Staff, described by Shirley Williams, who was at the time sponsored by APEX, as \"famous throughout the trade union movement as the most determinedly moderate and fundamentally anti-communist union of them all.\" Others called it the \"least dynamic and most right-wing of trade unions\", and pointed out that as a \"white-collar\" union it was not well-disposed to draw upon support from its members, often \"isolated groups of workers\" employed in small offices."]}, {"page": "Great Lives", "response": ["|Jayaben Desai, trade unionist"]}, {"page": "Jayaben desai", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jayaben Desai"]}, {"page": "Germaine Greer", "response": ["The National Portrait Gallery in London has purchased eight photographs of Greer, including by Bryan Wharton, Lord Snowdon and Polly Borland, and one painting by Paula Rego.
