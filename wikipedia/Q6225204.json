Rather than simply throwing the bomb out of the trench and endangering the lives of the men working on top, he immediately rushed to the spot shouting for his men to get clear, put his steel helmet over the grenade and then stood on the helmet. The grenade exploded, blowing him out of the trench causing him serious injuries, but no one else was hurt. He could not walk for 3 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Airdrie, North Lanarkshire", "response": ["*John Carmichael \u2013 soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross "]}, {"page": "List of Scottish Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["*John Carmichael \u2013 1917; Zwarteleen, Belgium"]}, {"page": "Falling on a grenade", "response": ["In World War I British soldier John Carmichael was awarded the Victoria Cross for saving his men by putting his steel helmet over a grenade and then standing on the helmet to reduce the blast damage.
