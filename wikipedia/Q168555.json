In the years leading up to the album, Tricky had grown frustrated with his limited role in the musical group Massive Attack and wanted to pursue an independent project. Shortly after, he discovered vocalist Martina Topley-Bird \u2013 who he felt would offer another dimension to his lyrics \u2013 and signed a solo contract with 4th & B'way in 1993. Tricky recorded Maxinquaye the following year, primarily at his home studio in London, with Topley-Bird serving as the album's main vocalist, while Alison Goldfrapp, Ragga and Mark Stewart performed additional vocals.", "Almost all of Topley-Bird's vocals on Maxinquaye were recorded in a single take, a process she later said was \"totally instinctive. There was no time to drum up an alter ego.\" Topley-Bird, a soft-spoken singer, found herself backed on most tracks by Tricky's rapped vocals. According to the journalist Sean O'Hagan, she sang with a \"broken voice\" that acted as \"the perfect foil to Tricky's whispered and drawled raps\". The liner notes credited Tricky and Topley-Bird for vocals on all songs except \"Pumpkin\" and \"You Don't\", which Tricky performed with Alison Goldfrapp and Ragga, respectively. A printing error mistakenly credited the then-unknown Topley-Bird as \"Martine\" on the record.
