He was born in Chingford, Essex and died at his home in Amberley, Gloucestershire.Ken Biddulph was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and a tail-end right-handed batsman. Colin McCool, who played alongside Biddulph on the Somerset side of the late 1950s, was not complimentary about Biddulph's abilities as an opening bowler in his ghosted book Cricket is a Game (1960), though Biddulph took a total of 162 wickets over the 1959 and 1960 seasons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stephen Chalke", "response": ["Chalke's cricket-writing career began after he received some bowling coaching from the former Somerset player Ken Biddulph in the early 1990s. He wrote down some of Biddulph's reminiscences, then interviewed other players from the 1950s and collected their cricket memories into his first book, Runs in the Memory. None of the publishers he approached thought the book was commercially viable, so he formed his own publishing firm, Fairfield Books, and published it himself.Stephen Chalke, A Long Half Hour: Six Cricketers Remembered, Fairfield Books, Bath, 2010, pp. 9\u201329.", "* A Long Half Hour: Six Cricketers Remembered (on Arthur Milton, Geoff Edrich, Bomber Wells, Dickie Dodds, Ken Biddulph and Eric Hill) (2010, )"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Ken Biddulph (1955\u20131961) 91 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Harold Stephenson", "response": ["He was highly rated by his colleagues as a wicketkeeper. McCool, in his memoirs Cricket is a Game, wrote: \"Steve has as good a pair of wicket-keeping hands as I have seen in the business. If I had to choose between him and Godfrey Evans, I would go for him every time.\"Quoted in  The fast-medium bowler Ken Biddulph, also from County Durham, called Stephenson a \"brilliant keeper: I never saw him have a bad day\"."]}, {"page": "Alan Whitehead (cricketer)", "response": ["Whitehead played for Somerset regularly again in the first half of the 1960 season, but he took only 17 wickets at the high average of 43.13. But he lost his place in the side in July when the amateur leg-spin bowler and schoolmaster, Colin Atkinson, became available to be the second spin bowler in the side alongside Langford. Atkinson took more wickets than Whitehead in 1960 and also made useful runs in the lower order. In 1961, Atkinson was available to Somerset for the whole season, and Whitehead played only one first-team match: in this game, he distinguished himself for the only time in his career with the bat, hanging on with fellow \"non-batsman\" Ken Biddulph for 35 minutes without scoring at the end of the game to earn Somerset a draw. Though he was a regular member of the Somerset second team which won the Minor Counties Championship for the first time in 1961, he left the county staff at the end of the season. He did not play first-class cricket again. He was still only 20 years old."]}, {"page": "John Harris (English cricketer)", "response": ["As a player, Harris was a lower-order left-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He made his debut for Somerset in May 1952 aged just 16 years and three months, the youngest cricketer ever to play for the county; he did not take a wicket in his first match but scored 18 out of a ninth wicket partnership of 48 with Bertie Buse. There were two further matches in 1953 before Harris disappeared from first-class cricket for three years on National Service. When his cricket career resumed with five matches in 1957, he made useful runs from the lower order, with a career-highest of 41 in the match against Worcestershire. But he still struggled for wickets in a Somerset side that, unlike the year of the debut, 1952, now had several options in fast and medium-paced bowling with the recruitment of Bill Alley, Ken Palmer, Bryan Lobb, Ken Biddulph and Geoff Lomax. He did not play at all in Somerset's successful season of 1958 but returned for seven games in 1959. These included his best bowling performance, three wickets for 29 runs against Worcestershire. But at the end of the season although his contract had a further year to go Harris retired due to an injury and a job offer as a coach with Framlingham College, Suffolk."]}, {"page": "Biddulph (surname)", "response": ["*Ken Biddulph (1932\u20132003), cricketer"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2003", "response": ["*Ken Biddulph, 70, British cricketer."]}]}}
