He played saxophone and harmonica, and sang occasional lead vocals on the band's first two albums, Music in a Doll's House and Family Entertainment. King also sang the entire lead vocal on \"Observations From a Hill\", a song on the latter album.\nJim, as he became known, formed James King and the Farinas (later just The Farinas), a blues based rock and roll group, with guitarist Charlie Whitney in Leicester in 1962.  He sang the lead vocal on the group's single \"You Better Stop\" b/w \"I Like it Like That\".  When Roger Chapman joined as vocalist in 1966, the group had begun to perform under the name The Roaring Sixties.  The name Family was decided upon later.\nKing left Family in October 1969 due to health issues and 'musical disagreements'. As well as session work for Dave Mason and Gordon Jackson, he joined the jazz-rock band Ring Of Truth for a brief period, doing a few gigs, then concentrated on composing and playing solo concerts, mostly classical sax with some jazz. In February 2012, he died while living in Cheshire, at the age of 69.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of singer-songwriters", "response": ["* Jim King"]}, {"page": "James King", "response": ["James King, Jim King or Jimmy King may refer to:", "*Jim King (politician) (1939\u20132009), American politician, Florida state senator", "*Jim King (basketball, born 1941) (born 1941), American basketball player, former basketball coach for the University of Tulsa", "*Jim King (basketball, born 1943), American basketball player in the 1968 Olympics", "*Jim King (footballer) (1873\u20131929), Australian rules footballer", "*Jim King (baseball) (1932\u20132015), American baseball player", "*Jim King (American football), American football coach", "*Jim King (saxophonist) (1942\u20132012), English rock musician, member of the band Family"]}, {"page": "Family (band)", "response": ["Family formed in late 1966 in Leicester, England, from the remaining members of a group that was previously known as The Farinas and later briefly The Roaring Sixties, whose sound was grounded in rhythm and blues though they did not record under that name. The Farinas originally consisted of John \"Charlie\" Whitney, Tim Kirchin (born around 1944, Birstall, Leicestershire died circa 2000), Harry Ovenall (born Richard Harry Ovenall, 12 September 1943, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire), and Jim King, forming at Leicester Art College in 1962. Ric Grech replaced Kirchin on bass in 1965 and Roger Chapman joined the following year on vocals. The American record producer Kim Fowley suggested they call themselves \"The Family\" as they regularly wore double-breasted suits in performances, giving themselves a mafia appearance, a look they soon abandoned in favour of a more casual dress code.", "Returning to the UK, the band performed at The Rolling Stones' Hyde Park gig and the Isle of Wight Festival that summer. In late 1969, Jim King was asked to leave Family due to \"erratic behaviour\" and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist John \"Poli\" Palmer.", "Family gave their final concert at the Hawthorn Building of Leicester Polytechnic on 13 October 1973. Many of its members went on to different musical projects; Roger Chapman and John \"Charlie\" Whitney formed the band Streetwalkers; John Wetton played with King Crimson and eventually became the lead singer of the band Asia. Rob Townsend was a member of Medicine Head between 1973 and 1975. He has been a member of The Blues Band since 1979 and of The Manfreds since 1991. Ric Grech died of kidney and liver failure in 1990 at the age of 43, as a result of alcoholism. Tony Ashton died in 2001 at the age of 55 of cancer.

Encore 1: Weaver's Answer; Encore 2: My Friend the Sun, Sweet Desiree. During these performances Chapman paid warm tributes to absent band members Rick Grech, Tony Ashton, Jim King, John Weider, John Wetton and Charlie Whitney during the band's performance. The band went on to appear at the Rockin' the Park Festival at Clumber Park in Notts on 16 August 2013.", "Family's sound was distinguished by several factors. The vocals of Roger Chapman, described as a \"bleating vibrato\" and an \"electric goat\", were considered unique, although Chapman was trying to emulate the voices of R&B and soul singers Little Richard and Ray Charles, with some reviewers noting however that Chapman's voice could be grating and irritating occasionally. John \"Charlie\" Whitney was an accomplished and innovative guitarist, and Family's often complex song arrangements were made possible through having multi-instrumentalists like Ric Grech, Jim King and Poli Palmer in the band and access to keyboards such as the Hammond organ, the new Mellotron, violin, flute and vibraphone. The band's sound has been variously described as progressive rock, psychedelic rock, acid rock, folk rock, jazz fusion, not to mention \"British art rock,\" and hard rock.", "*Jim King \u2013 saxophones, harmonica, tin whistle, piano, vocals (1966\u20131969)", "*Jim King - saxophones, backing and lead vocals, harmonica, keyboards", "*Jim King - saxophones, backing and lead vocals, harmonica, keyboards", "*Jim King - saxophones, backing and lead vocals, harmonica, keyboards"]}, {"page": "Roger Chapman", "response": ["Chapman was originally the vocalist for Farinas, who released the single \"You'd Better Stop\" b/w \"I Like It Like That\" in August 1964. (However, lead vocals on that single were performed by Jim King.) He moved on to join The Roaring Sixties who were renamed Family in 1966. In 1967 the first single was released, \"Scene Through The Eye of a Lens\", something of a psychedelic classic. Chapman wrote most of Family's songs with Charlie Whitney and their debut album Music in a Doll's House was released in 1968.

Weider also provides a lilting violin solo in the middle eight.  The song fades out with a quickly paced jam, with plenty of \"pickin' and grinnin'\" country and western guitar from Whitney.  Roger Chapman's relaxed vocals add to the gentle nature of the lyrics.", "\"No Mule's Fool\" and its B-side, \"Good Friend of Mine,\" were the last Family recordings to feature Jim King, who left the group shortly thereafter, as well as the first Family recordings to feature Weider."]}, {"page": "John Palmer (musician)", "response": ["Palmer replaced Jim King in Family and immediately went to work on the group's third album, A Song For Me.  Many of that album's songs had to be re-arranged, as they were written with King's saxophone and harmonica in mind.  Palmer rose to the challenge, transforming songs with his different instruments.  \"Drowned in Wine\" became a full-blown rocker with his overamplified flute, and his vibraphones added a jazz touch to the blues number \"Love Is a Sleeper.\"  A Song For Me was released in January 1970 to rave reviews, and Family seemed re-invigorated by Palmer's arrival."]}, {"page": "Music in a Doll's House", "response": ["* Jim King \u2013 tenor and soprano saxophones, vocals, harmonica"]}, {"page": "Old Songs New Songs", "response": ["Highlights of this package were songs previously released on 45rpm records only (marked by an asterisk) and four tracks from the sessions of their second album \"Family Entertainment\" partially re-recorded and remixed for this release.
