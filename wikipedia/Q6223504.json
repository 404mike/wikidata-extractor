At club level he played for Clyde, Hibernian, Dundee and Kilmarnock, helping Clyde win the Scottish Cup in 1939. He also played once for the Scotland national football team, in a 1939 British Home Championship match against Wales.\nBrown's football career was clearly interrupted by the Second World War, as his two greatest achievements, winning a Scotland cap and the Scottish Cup, came during the last season completed before the war. Brown only conceded one goal in the whole competition en route to winning the Scottish Cup, a penalty kick in a 4\u20131 win against Rangers. He later complained that he would not have conceded even that solitary goal if Rangers had used their regular penalty taker, Bob McPhail, because Brown knew where McPhail normally placed his penalties. A transfer to Arsenal was proposed, but did not materialise due to the outbreak of war in September 1939.During the war he entered the service of the Royal Navy, while making guest appearances for Hamilton Academical. He transferred to Hibernian in 1942, but played for teams including St Mirren, Airdrieonians and Gillingham of England's Kent League between 1944 and 1946. Upon returning to Hibernian, he helped them win the Scottish league championship in 1947\u201348.Brown then had spells with Dundee and Kilmarnock before retiring as a player in 1950. He then became a physiotherapist, working for Kilmarnock, the All Blacks and the Scotland national rugby union team. Brown was the first person to serve in that function for the Scotland rugby side.Brown was part of a sizeable sporting family. His sons Peter and Gordon (Broon frae Troon) both played for Scotland at rugby union, while two of his brothers, Tom and Jim, also played professional football, as did an uncle by marriage, Alex Lambie. Jim was selected by the United States for the 1930 FIFA World Cup, and in turn his son George later also played for the USA (although born in England and raised in Scotland). Brown himself was also a talented player of both badminton and golf, playing off a scratch handicap.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Brown", "response": ["John Brown most often refers to:", "*John Brown (abolitionist) (1800\u20131859), American who led an anti-slavery raid in Harpers Ferry, Virginia in 1859", "John Brown or Johnny Brown may also refer to:", "*John Browne (anatomist) (1642\u20131702),  British anatomist and surgeon", "*John Brown (physician, born 1735) (1735\u20131788), Scottish physician", "*John Brown (physician, born 1810) (1810\u20131882), Scottish physician and essayist", "*John Brown (actor) (1904\u20131957), English radio and film actor", "*John Brown (fl. 2007), rapper and contestant on Ego Trip's The (White) Rapper Show", "*John Brown (British Army officer) (died 1762), British Army general", "*John Brown of Pittsfield (1744\u20131780), American Revolutionary War officer", "*John Brown (sailor) (1826\u20131883), American sailor and Civil War Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Brown (Medal of Honor) (1838\u2013?), American sailor and peacetime Medal of Honor recipient", "*John Brown Jr. (Navajo) (1921\u20132009), American Navajo Code Talker during World War II", "*John Brown (British Army soldier) (died 1964), UK spy and POW during World War II", "*John Brown (New South Wales politician) (1821\u20131896), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, 1880\u20131882", "*John Brown (Queensland politician) (1881\u20131949), blacksmith and member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly", "*John Brown (Tasmanian politician) (1886\u20131974), member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, 1948", "*John Brown (Australian politician) (born 1931), elected to the Australian House of Representatives, 1977\u20131990", "*John Brown (Upper Canada politician) (1791\u20131842)", "*John Brown (Richmond Hill politician) (fl. 1870s\u20131880s)", "*John Brown (Canadian politician) (1841\u20131905), member of Parliament", "*John Brown (Ontario MPP) (1849\u20131924), member of Ontario assembly and mayor of Stratford, Ontario", "*John Brown (Rhode Island politician) (1736\u20131803), U.S. representative, co-founder of Brown University", "*John Brown (North Carolina politician) (1738\u20131812), pioneer and statesman", "*John Brown (Kentucky politician) (1757\u20131837), U.S. representative and U.S. senator; member of Continental Congress from Virginia", "*John Brown (Maryland politician) (1760\u20131815), U.S. representative", "*John Brown (Pennsylvania politician) (1772\u20131845), U.S. representative", "*John Brown (Texas politician) (1786\u20131852), speaker of the Texas state House of Representatives", "*John Brown (Cherokee chief) (fl. 1830s)", "*John Brown (Seminole chief) (1842\u20131919), Confederate States Army officer", "*John Brown Jr. (Navajo) (1921\u20132009), member of Navajo Tribal Council", "*John Brown (Wales MP) (died c. 1654)", "*John Brown of Priesthill (1627\u20131685), Scottish Protestant martyr", "*John Brown (essayist) (1715\u20131766), English clergyman", "*John Brown of Haddington (1722\u20131787), Scottish clergyman and Biblical commentator", "*John Brown (Vicar of St Mary's, Leicester) (died 1845), British evangelical preacher", "*John Brown (minister) (1784\u20131858), Scottish clergyman and writer", "*John Brown (Mormon pioneer) (1820\u20131897)", "*John Brown (writer) (1830\u20131922), Doctor of Divinity, pastor of Bunyan's Chapel, and author of many works of theology and church history", "*John Brown (moderator) (1850\u20131919), Scottish minister", "*John E.
