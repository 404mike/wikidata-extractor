The son of the admiral Sir Errol Manners, he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932 to 1958. He served in the Second World War and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the Distinguished Service Cross for his role in the sinking of the German submarine U-1274 in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard HMS Viceroy.\nAs a first-class cricketer, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler. He began his playing career with Hampshire in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at Sandhurst. He played county cricket for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the Combined Services cricket team. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries.\nIn September 2014, Manners became the oldest living first-class cricketer and in September 2018 he became the longest-lived first-class cricketer, surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by Jim Hutchinson.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 25", "response": ["*1914 \u2013 John Manners, English naval officer and cricketer (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "John Manners", "response": ["John Manners may refer to:", "* John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland (1638\u20131711)", "* John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland (1676\u20131721)", "* John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland (1696\u20131779)", "* John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland (1778\u20131857)", "* John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland (1818\u20131896), better known as Lord John Manners in his role as a 19th-century statesman", "* John Manners, 9th Duke of Rutland (1886\u20131980)", "* John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland (c. 1552 \u2013 1588)", "* John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland (1604\u20131679)", "* John Manners, Marquess of Granby (1721\u20131770) an 18th-century military officer, son of the 3rd Duke of Rutland", "* John Manners (died 1438), MP for Northumberland (UK Parliament constituency)", "* John Manners (died 1611), MP for Nottinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "* John Manners (MP) (1730\u20131792), politician", "* Hon.
