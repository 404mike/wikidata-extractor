No extant subspecies are accepted. However, fossils found in the Ichetucknee River in Florida, and originally described as a new form of heron (Palaeophoyx columbiana McCoy, 1963) were later recognized to be a smaller, prehistoric subspecies of the American bittern which lived during the Late Pleistocene (Olson, 1974) and would thus be called B. l. columbianus.

His mother was Charlotte (died 1791), the daughter of John Edmonds, Esq. of St Hilary. There were three sisters, Charlotte-Frances, Maria-Eleanor, Louisa. In 1799, during his father's lifetime, Traherne was virtually adopted by his great-aunt, Mrs. John Llewellin, who paid the expenses of his education at private schools and tutors until he entered at Oriel College, Oxford, in April 1807, where he was taught by Edward Copleston, then tutor, afterwards head of that College, and subsequently Bishop of Llandaff. While a student, he made the acquaintance of Rev. Thomas Rackett (1757\u20131841), Rector of Spetisbury and Charlton, Co. Dorset, and from him developed an interest for topographical and antiquarian studies. It was Rackett who introduced Traherne to members of the literary and scientific circles of London.
