His brother, John Hungerford Arkwright, was Lord Lieutenant of Herefordshire, whose son John Stanhope Arkwright was also an MP. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1857. He was called to the bar from Lincoln's Inn in 1859 and in 1862 married Lady Mary Caroline Byng, a daughter of the Earl of Strafford.\nArkwright was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Leominster at an unopposed  by-election in February 1866, and stated that his position was not to oppose every change, but that he was against any 'great organic changes being made in matters connected with Church or State'. He held the seat until he resigned from the House of Commons on 8 February 1876. At the resulting by-election, the Leominster seat was gained by a Liberal.\nAfter retiring from parliament, Arkwright was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant for Herefordshire.In 1886, Arkwright published Driven Home: A Tale of Destiny under the pseudonym Evelyn Owen. It is a mystery story with supernatural elements. In 1889, he published a second novel, The Queen Anne\u2019s Gate Mystery.
