Resourceful and clever, Livens' successful creations were characterised by being very practical and easy to produce in large numbers. In an obituary, Sir Harold Hartley said \"Livens combined great energy and enterprise with a flair for seeing simple solutions and inventive genius.\"Livens is best known for inventing the Livens Projector, a simple mortar-like weapon that could throw large drums filled with inflammable or toxic chemicals. In World War I, the Livens Projector became the standard means of delivering gas attacks and it remained in the arsenal of the British army until the early years of the Second World War.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Flamethrower", "response": ["The British experimented with flamethrowers in the Battle of the Somme, during which they used experimental weapons called \"Livens Large Gallery Flame Projectors\", named for their inventor, William Howard Livens, a Royal Engineers officer.

The weapon had an effective range of 90 yards, which proved effective at clearing trenches, but with no other benefit the project was abandoned."]}, {"page": "List of inventors", "response": ["* William Howard Livens (1889\u20131964), UK \u2013 chemical warfare \u2013 Livens Projector"]}, {"page": "Dishwasher", "response": ["In the United Kingdom, William Howard Livens invented a small, non-electric dishwasher suitable for domestic use in 1924.

Drying elements were even added to his design in 1940. It was the first machine suitable for domestic use, and it came at a time when permanent plumbing and running water in the house was becoming increasingly common."]}, {"page": "Golders Green Crematorium", "response": ["* William Howard Livens, military engineer and inventor"]}, {"page": "Ruston (engine builder)", "response": ["In World War 1, the company made around 2,750 aeroplanes and 3,000 aero engines.
