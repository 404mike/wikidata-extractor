In 1866, the journalist William Jerdan wrote that \"From Marco Polo to Mungo Park, no three of the most famous travellers, grouped together, would exceed the extent and variety of countries traversed by our blind countryman.\" In 1832, Holman became the first blind person to circumnavigate the globe.
