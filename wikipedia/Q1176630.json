It is an Ising model with long range frustrated ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic couplings. It corresponds to a mean-field approximation of spin glasses describing the slow dynamics of the magnetization and the complex non-ergodic equilibrium state."]}, {"page": "Dirac Medal", "response": ["* 2007: David Sherrington (University of Oxford)  For his pioneering work in spin glasses."]}, {"page": "Royal Society Bakerian Medal", "response": ["*2001 David Sherrington, Magnets, microchips, memories and markets: statistical physics of complex systems."]}, {"page": "Advances in Physics", "response": ["Advances in Physics is a bimonthly scientific journal published by Taylor & Francis that was established in 1952.
