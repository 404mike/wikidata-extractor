Although Robinson's family, on the paternal and maternal side were involved in local government, he sought a career as a stained-glass artist. During World War I he initially enlisted in the Artists Rifles, and was then released from military service to manage a shell factory. Three of his four younger brothers were to be killed in the Great War.\nRobinson attended Clifton College and Royal West of England Academy, followed by an apprenticeship with Christopher Whall. Through his relationship with Joseph Bell & Son, Robinson received commissions for work, became a director at the firm and later became owner. He became part-owner of the flagging Bristol Guild of Applied Art, which then became a well-reputed and successful guild in Bristol.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Tyndale", "response": ["*Works of Arnold Wathen Robinson, reference to stained glass featuring William Tyndale"]}, {"page": "Charles Wesley", "response": ["File:Charles Wesley 2.JPG|Wesley at St. Matthew's Church in Bristol, by Arnold Wathen Robinson"]}, {"page": "Bristol Cathedral", "response": ["Some of the most recent stained glass is by Bristolian Arnold Wathen Robinson following damage during the Bristol Blitz of 1940 and 1941. These included depictions of local Civil Defence during World War II including St. John Ambulance, the British Red Cross and the fire services along with air raid wardens, police officers, the Home Guard and the Women's Voluntary Service.
