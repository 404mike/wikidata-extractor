Journalist Patrick Brogan wrote, \"It appeared for a while that Iraq would be strangled economically before it was defeated militarily.\" Syria's closure of the Kirkuk\u2013Baniyas pipeline left Iraq with the pipeline to Turkey as the only means of exporting oil, along with transporting oil by tanker truck to the port of Aqaba in Jordan. However, the Turkish pipeline had a capacity of only , which was insufficient to pay for the war. However, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the other Gulf states saved Iraq from bankruptcy by providing it with an average of $60\u00a0billion in subsidies per year. Though Iraq had previously been hostile towards other Gulf states, \"the threat of Persian fundamentalism was far more feared.\" They were especially inclined to fear Iranian victory after Ayatollah Khomeini declared monarchies to be illegitimate and an un-Islamic form of government. Khomeini's statement was widely received as a call to overthrow the Gulf monarchies. Journalists John Bulloch and Harvey Morris wrote:", "NEDSA commander announced in September 2020 that Iran spent $19.6 billion in the war. The war furthered the decline of the Iranian economy that had begun with the revolution in 1978\u201379. Between 1979 and 1981, foreign exchange reserves fell from $14.6\u00a0billion to $1\u00a0billion. As a result of the war, living standards dropped dramatically, and Iran was described by British journalists John Bulloch and Harvey Morris as \"a dour and joyless place\" ruled by a harsh regime that \"seemed to have nothing to offer but endless war\". Though Iran was becoming bankrupt, Khomeini interpreted Islam's prohibition of usury to mean they could not borrow against future oil revenues to meet war expenses. As a result, Iran funded the war by the income from oil exports after cash had run out. The revenue from oil dropped from $20\u00a0billion in 1982 to $5\u00a0billion in 1988.French historian Pierre Razoux argued that this sudden drop in economic industrial potential, in conjunction with the increasing aggression of Iraq, placed Iran in a challenging position that had little leeway other than accepting Iraq's conditions of peace."]}, {"page": "John Bulloch (Journalist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Bulloch (journalist)"]}, {"page": "John Bulloch (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Bulloch is a politician.", "John Bulloch may also refer to:", "*John Bulloch (journalist) (1928\u20132010)", "*John Bulloch, founder of Canadian Federation of Independent Business"]}]}}
