He also played on loan at Port Vale, and previously played non-league football for Kidderminster Harriers, Darlaston, and Highgate United. He won the League Cup with Villa in 1975, and was also promoted out of the Second Division. He later became a coach, and led the Aston Villa youth players to FA Youth Cup victory in 1980; he later served Birmingham City as caretaker manager in 1986.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["Lee released Freddie Goodwin, and sold Sammy Morgan to Aston Villa for \u00a322,222. He built for the 1973\u201374 campaign by drafting in tall young players David Harris and John Ridley from the youth set-up, as well as versatile Keith Chadwick from Crewe Alexandra. After a spate of injuries, he signed Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. Seemingly taking the club as far as he could, he left Burslem in January 1974 for a club with a much bigger potential.

On 1 October, Vale beat Wrexham 1\u20130 in an 'ugly' game that saw five players booked and Colin Tartt and opposition player Arfon Griffiths separated by police following a scrap in the tunnel. Later in the month Roy Cross badly injured his knee, and would later have to leave the professional game due to the injury. Vale slipped down the league, and by Christmas they were sixth from bottom, with only John Woodward in good form. Lee then took out striker Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. He also changed the formation from 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133, hoping to give Brian Horton more room in the centre of the park. After an upturn in form in the new year, Bill Summerscales broke his neck, and Lee departed for the management position at Blackburn Rovers. Lee had been seen to have done an excellent job with little money. In his place club legend Roy Sproson was appointed as caretaker manager, who advocated an 'entertaining' style of play as opposed to battling for every point. Winning his first match 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town, he cracked his head on the concrete trainer's box after leaping up to celebrate McLaren's goal. On 17 February, 8,505 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 3\u20131 win over high-flying Bristol Rovers in an experimental Sunday game. Later Leonard returned to Villa Park at the end of his loan deal, and \u00a35,000 was not enough to tempt Villa to part with his services permanently. From mid-March Vale went eleven games without a win, and on 25 March they could have ended this run, but 'a shocking mistake' from Alan Boswell handed Walsall an equalizer as he palmed a header into his own net. The team continued to rack up yellow cards, and following a warning from The Football Association, Sproson arranged for local referee Roy Capey to lecture the players on sportsmanship. In the middle of April, Sproson was given the management job on a permanent basis, despite his team falling to fifth from bottom. Sproson stated that he was 'calculated' and 'controlled', compared to Lee who 'fizzes like a bottle of pop'. By the time they broke their poor run with a 2\u20131 home win over managerless Charlton Athletic, other results had already ensured their safety from the drop.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Keith Leonard", "|\u2013||FW||||Keith Leonard||1||0||0||1", "| November 1973 || FW ||  || Keith Leonard || Aston Villa || February 1974 || "]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with two Bailey goals, though Vale would have to wait until their fourth match for a victory, at which point their coffers were boosted by \u00a310,000 following Sammy Morgan's success at Aston Villa. In September, Sproson made a \u00a310,000 bid for Keith Leonard that was rejected. Instead he brought in young left-back Garry Dulson on loan from Nottingham Forest, and later bought him permanently for \u00a35,000, using another \u00a35,400 Villa were forced to pay Vale after Morgan hit another target. The \"Valiants\" proved difficult to beat, and heading into Christmas they won six of their last nine league games. Their 4\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town lifted them into third place, though attendances were still below 4,000. A 3\u20131 win over Southend United at Roots Hall then put the club into second spot, at which point Bob Mountford was sold to Rochdale for \u00a32,000. A four-day holiday in Benidorm in the new year did not seem to help the Vale, as three straight defeats followed to drag them down the table. To halt the slide Sproson bought striker Derek Brownbill from Liverpool for \u00a35,000. Two sendings off in a 3\u20131 defeat at Leeds Road \u2013 John Brodie also managed to break his leg in the challenge that earned him a red card \u2013 forced Sproson to defend his team after that took the Vale's red card tally to seven for the season. Nevertheless, a solid spell put Vale back into the promotion race by March, though their form dropped off again, and their hopes were crushed completely on 26 April with a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Gordon Lee's champions-elect Blackburn Rovers."]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Football League Cup", "response": ["|CF ||9 ||Keith Leonard"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["*  Keith Leonard, Forward, 24"]}]}}
