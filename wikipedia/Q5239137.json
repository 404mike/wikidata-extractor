He donated \u00a318 million to the University of Cambridge to establish a new college in his name.  Robinson College, Cambridge, the newest in the university, was formally opened in 1981.  Robinson also donated \u00a33 million to start the Rosie Hospital, named after his mother, which is now a part of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.\nRobinson was born in Cambridge, England, but later moved to Bedford.  He built a business renting radios and televisions, which was commercially successful.  Robinson was also involved with horse-racing: in the late 1960s and 1970s he owned a large number of winning horses which also yielded significant profits.\nHis racing stables, Clarehaven, was one of the biggest racing stables in England.  His string of 120-150 horses was split between two trainers, Michael Jarvis  and Paul Davey.\nHe was knighted in 1985, and died two years later in Newmarket, the centre of English horse-racing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 13", "response": ["*1904 \u2013 David Robinson, English businessman and philanthropist (d. 1987)"]}, {"page": "January 10", "response": ["*  1987   \u2013 David Robinson, English businessman and philanthropist (b. 1904)"]}, {"page": "2000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| David Robinson"]}, {"page": "Newmarket, Suffolk", "response": ["Many wealthy owners of racing stables and studs have also lived in Newmarket, including David Robinson, David Thompson, Rachel Parsons and Lester Piggott."]}, {"page": "Robinson College, Cambridge", "response": ["Despite this, it retains many of the same traditions and institutions of other Cambridge colleges, including formal hall, Latin grace, a chapel and porters' lodge.
