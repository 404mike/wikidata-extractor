To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerald Woodroffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on Sabotage. During the recording of Technical Ecstasy, Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians. Recording of Technical Ecstasy was difficult; by the time the album was completed Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain. It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and (for the first time) later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was \"unravelling at an alarming rate\". The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. Technical Ecstasy failed to reach the top 50 in the U.S., and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve platinum status, although it was later certified gold in 1997. The album included \"Dirty Women\", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song \"It's Alright\". Touring in support of Technical Ecstasy began in November 1976, with openers Boston and Ted Nugent in the U.S., and completed in Europe with AC/DC in April 1977."]}, {"page": "The Belle Stars", "response": ["Black Sabbath keyboardist Gerald Woodroffe was a member of the Belle Stars.", "*Gerald Woodroffe : Keyboards"]}, {"page": "The Principle of Moments", "response": ["*Gerald Woodroffe: synthesizers, TR-808 on track 8"]}, {"page": "Gerald Woodruffe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerald Woodroffe"]}, {"page": "Jezz Woodroffe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gerald Woodroffe"]}, {"page": "Technical Ecstasy Tour", "response": ["* Gerald Woodroffe \u2013 keyboards"]}]}}
