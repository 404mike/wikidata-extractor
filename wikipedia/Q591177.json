Ruskin's first formal teaching role came about in the mid-1850s, when he taught drawing classes (assisted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti) at the Working Men's College, established by the Christian socialists, Frederick James Furnivall and Frederick Denison Maurice. Although Ruskin did not share the founders' politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment. One result of this involvement was Ruskin's Elements of Drawing (1857). He had taught several women drawing, by means of correspondence, and his book represented both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.ODNB. The WMC was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, George Allen.Robert Hewison, Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226."]}, {"page": "1910 in literature", "response": ["*July 2 \u2013 Frederick James Furnivall, English lexicographer (born 1825)"]}, {"page": "1861 in literature", "response": ["*April 23 \u2013 Herbert Coleridge, first editor of what will become the Oxford English Dictionary, dies aged 30 of tuberculosis in London.
