S. Duleepsinhji, had stood down because of the death of his father; Scott was unable to resume in 1934, and Melville took over the Sussex captaincy for the next two seasons. Sussex had finished second in the County Championship for each of the preceding two seasons and under Melville in 1934 they again finished second, but there was veiled criticism of changes to the county's style of play in the 1935 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. \"Sussex, renowned for their attractive and enterprising hitting, developed a somewhat stodgy game in their efforts to finish at the top and they thus defeated their own ends,\" it said. \"At times they would not risk anything.\" Wisden compared Melville's \"strange disinclination to experiment\" with the adventurous approach taken by Maurice Tate, the senior professional at the club, who captained the side when Melville missed a few games. As a batsman, Melville was highly successful, scoring 1504 runs at an average of 42.97 with three centuries, though in the heady world of Sussex batting at the time that still left him only fifth in the county's batting averages, behind Tommy Cook, John Langridge, Jim Parks, Sr. and Harry Parks."]}, {"page": "Thomas Cooke", "response": ["*Tommy Cook (actor) (born 1930), American actor and former child star", "*Tommy Cook (sportsman) (1901\u20131950), former Sussex batsman, footballer and football manager"]}, {"page": "Glenn Murray", "response": ["On 1 September 2018 Murray scored twice to take Brighton from 2\u20130 down to draw 2\u20132 with Fulham.

In October after being linked with the England set up again after a run of decent form Murray played down the England talk but would welcome a call-up, however he was not selected in the upcoming squad and from then on the England talk evaporated.  Murray signed a one-year contract extension on 13 November that runs to the summer of 2020. After 9 games without scoring, on 29 January 2019 Murray scored another two goals against Fulham in a 4\u20132 away defeat. This time Fulham came back from 2 goals behind, and won. On 6 February 2019 Murray scored another two goals this time coming off the bench in a fourth round FA Cup replay against West Brom where his goals put Brighton 2\u20131 and 3\u20131 up in the 3\u20131 victory. On 9 March 2019 Murray scored his 100th league goal for The Seagulls at his former club and bitter rivals Crystal Palace in a 2\u20131 away victory.

Immediately after the war, the signing of former England international forward George Holley for a club record \u00a3200 fee was viewed as quite a coup. Holley suffered a career-ending injury, so hardly played, but Webb replaced him with Jack Doran who finished as the club's top scorer despite joining halfway through the season.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, pp. 68\u201370. He brought Tommy Cook through from the juniors into the first team; Cook was top scorer in three seasons, but when he left the club to concentrate on his cricket career, Webb brought in the Queens Park Rangers reserve Hugh Vallance, who turned out to be a \"goalscoring phenomenon\" alongside Dan Kirkwood.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 91. Again, when twice top scorer Arthur Attwood succumbed to appendicitis in 1933, Webb signed former Norwich City centre-forward Oliver \"Buster\" Brown who had failed to break into the first team at West Ham United; with regular football at Albion, Brown produced 41 goals in his first two seasons.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 102.", "No longer of an age for active service, Webb joined the Home Guard during the war. Albion continued to compete in the various wartime leagues, and Webb skilfully exploited the regulations allowing players to make guest appearances for the club nearest to their base. He was particularly fortunate that the King's Liverpool Regiment's posting to Newhaven in 1941 gave him the pick of Liverpool F.C.'s pre-war team.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, pp. 117\u2013119. In their absence, he was reduced to selecting youngsters or soliciting members of the crowd to make up the numbers, as at Norwich City at Christmas 1940, when his travelling party of one senior player and three amateurs was supplemented by Jimmy Ithell of Bolton Wanderers, Norwich City juniors and local servicemen; Albion lost 18\u20130.Camillin & Weir, p. 39. At the end of the 1946\u201347 season, at the age of 60, Webb handed over responsibility for team affairs to former player Tommy Cook, remaining with the club on the administrative side, as secretary and general manager. A few days after a 4\u20130 home defeat to Walsall left Albion at the bottom of the table, provoking a demonstration after the match, the directors appointed Don Welsh as secretary-manager. Webb stayed on until the end of the 1947\u201348 season to assist his successor, then left the club and retired from football.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 134."]}, {"page": "List of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players", "response": ["Of the nearly 200 men who made 100 or more appearances in first-team competition for Brighton & Hove Albion, Tug Wilson has 75 more appearances than the next contender.

Tommy Cook tops the club's all-time scorers list, with 123 goals from 209 peacetime matches. Kit Napier's 99 remained a post-Second World War record for nearly 50 years, until Glenn Murray scored his 100th Albion goal in October 2018. Arthur Attwood's club record of 35 goals scored in a single season stood for 45 years, until Peter Ward went one better in 1976\u201377 to set a mark that still stands.

Albion's first England international was Tommy Cook, who played against Wales in 1925; Billy Booth was selected as travelling reserve in 1913, but his services were not needed. The man with most caps for his country while an Albion player is Shane Duffy for Republic of Ireland with 30; he overtook the previous record of 17, held jointly by Gerry Ryan and Steve Penney, in October 2018.
