He was born in Nottinghamshire, where he had trials to play cricket, but he moved south after failing to make the county team. He was misused in his solitary match for Somerset in 1883, but his ability as a fast bowler was identified by Gloucestershire, and he played regularly there from 1884 until 1886. He made his final first-class appearance in 1889, finishing his career with 55 wickets. He died at the age of 36 after suffering general paralysis.", "link_mentions": {}}}
