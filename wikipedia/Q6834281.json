The planned changes to the will not having been finalised, she inherited almost his entire estate, worth an estimated \u00a34.5 million (\u00a3 million today), and his children received \u00a3800 each (\u00a3 today).Richard Savill,The Telegraph: \"Peter Sellers tried to cut fourth wife Lynne Frederick out of his \u00a34.5 million will\", 5 November 2009 Despite appeals from a number of Sellers' friends to make a fair settlement to the children, Frederick refused to give her stepchildren anything due to their rocky relationship with her and Peter. After Sellers' death, her stepson, Michael Sellers, published an expos\u00e9 memoir concerning his relationship with his father, P.S. I Love You: An Intimate Portrait of Peter Sellers. In the book, he accused Frederick of being a deceitful, cunning and narcissistic fraud who only married his father for his money. He also alleged that Frederick had cheated his sisters and him out of their inheritance by intentionally manipulating their father to alter the will in her favour. This led to the press vilifying and labeling her as a \"gold digger\".", "Frederick's relationship with her former stepchildren (Michael Sellers, Sarah Sellers, and Victoria Sellers) was, like Peter's relationship with them, distant and often strained. When Lynne began her relationship with Peter, she made efforts to establish a friendly connection with them. Sarah recalled of Lynne, \"she seemed quite nice to begin with. I actually told dad that I thought she was a bit stupid. But she came across as very bubbly, friendly, warm and interested. But once they got married things definitely changed\". Michael Sellers wrote of Frederick in his expos\u00e9 memoir, \"my first impression of Lynne didn't do much to alter my views. She was not exactly my idea of sweetness and light. It didn't concern me that she lacked the good looks of dad's past wives and girlfriends, but those innocent eyes, certainly her strongest feature, didn't deceive me\". Michael Sellers also bluntly acknowledged his intentional hostility and lack of respect towards Lynne when they first met: \"I'm afraid we weren't very kind in our judgement of Lynne. Sarah thought she wasn't too bright. But our views didn't really count for much. Because whatever our opinions, they would be of purely academic interest\". Months after Frederick's death in 1994, Victoria remarked \"I feel now that she's in hell - I don't know but that makes me feel better.\""]}, {"page": "Mike Sellers", "response": ["Michael Sellers (born July 21, 1975) is a former American football fullback in the National Football League (NFL).
