He played over 450 matches in the Football League.\nRobson won the First Division with Burnley in 1960, beating Manchester City in the final game of the season to win the title.In the 1962 FA Cup Final, Robson's goal against Tottenham Hotspur to make it 1\u20131 was the 100th goal ever scored in an FA Cup final at Wembley. Burnley lost 3\u20131. Robson did score another goal but it was ruled off-side.On 27 April 1966, Robson became the first Blackpool substitute to score a goal. It came in a 2\u20131 defeat at Manchester United.After developing Alzheimer's disease, Robson died on 14 December 2021, at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burnley F.C.", "response": ["The record for the most first team appearances in all competitions for Burnley is held by goalkeeper and one-club man Jerry Dawson, who played 569 games between 1907 and 1929.

The plan was delayed by the outbreak of the Second World War, but the new Longside terrace was eventually completed in 1954. Constructed on the four-decade-old embankment, the club spent \u00a320,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 as of ) on the roof alone.  The terrace was built with help from the Burnley youth players. In 1955, Burnley became one of the first clubs to set up a purpose-built training centre, on 80 acres of farmland at Gawthorpe Hall purchased by their new chairman, Bob Lord. The club installed permanent floodlights in 1957, which were first used during a friendly against local rivals Blackburn Rovers. Around this time, terracing was added to the banking at the Bee Hole End. As a result of Burnley's 1959\u201360 First Division title win, Turf Moor hosted its first ever European Cup match on 16 November 1960; Jimmy Robson and Jimmy McIlroy scored early in the first half as Burnley recorded a 2\u20130 victory over French team Stade de Reims. In 1969, the Cricket Field Stand was built at a cost of \u00a3180,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 as of ) and incorporated the changing rooms, which made Turf Moor one of the few English grounds to have the players' tunnel behind one of the goals.Inglis (1996), p. 87 It was the first stand to include oil-fired heating for supporters, with hot air blown through holes under the seats. The system was abandoned after two seasons due to the costs. The club also extended the open terrace at the Bee Hole End in 1970, with the aim of increasing its capacity to around 20,000."]}, {"page": "1960\u201361 European Cup", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Jimmy Robson"]}, {"page": "1962 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Tottenham Hotspur took an early lead when Jimmy Greaves scored past the Burnley goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw with a low left foot shot to the right corner of the net. The score remained 1\u20130 until half time. Burnley equalised shortly after the interval through Jimmy Robson, who in doing so had scored the 100th FA Cup Final goal at Wembley. However, Bobby Smith quickly countered for Tottenham Hotspur to restore their one-goal lead. Smith had scored in the 1961 final, and remained the only player to score in successive finals for the next forty years, until Freddie Ljungberg of Arsenal repeated the feat with goals in the 2001 and 2002 finals.", "The game also pivoted on two moments of controversy. The first came midway through the second half when Jimmy Robson was put through to score what looked like a second equaliser for Burnley. The linesman's flag ruled the goal out and while BBC television pictures are not conclusive the call was an extremely close one. The second centred on Tottenham's decisive penalty when the opposite linesman flagged for a foul, presumably on goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw seconds before the handball incident for which the penalty was awarded. The referee did not seem to see the linesman's flag and pointed to the spot while, to their credit, none of the Burnley players protested.", "| ||10|| Jimmy Robson"]}, {"page": "Cliviger", "response": ["* Jimmy Robson, former Burnley FC forward."]}, {"page": "May 1962", "response": ["*Tottenham Hotspur F.C. retained the FA Cup with a 3\u20131 win over Burnley F.C. in front of 100,000 fans (including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip) at Wembley Stadium, and became only the second team in Football League history to win the Cup two years in a row.\"Super Spurs turn Cup Final into a Soccer Classic\", The Observer (London), May 6, 1962, p20\"Tottenham English Soccer King Again\", Miami News, May 6, 1962, p1C  Goals were scored for the Spurs by Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Smith and captain Danny Blanchflower, with the Clarets' sole score coming from Jimmy Robson.
