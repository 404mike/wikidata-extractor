He also played Minor Counties cricket for Shropshire and Cornwall. He was a left-handed middle-order batsman but though a prolific scorer at second eleven and Minor Counties level, he was not able to establish himself in first-class cricket.\nWilletts played for Somerset's second eleven as a batsman from 1960, and in the 1964 season made more than 900 runs for the second team, playing in both the Minor Counties Championship and the Second Eleven Championship. He was brought into Somerset's first team for three matches in mid-season, but made little impact. The following season, 1965, he was given six matches, but only in the game against Glamorgan at Weston-super-Mare did he make significant runs, his first-innings 38 being the highest score of his career. His first List A appearance was in a losing Gillette Cup semi-final in 1966 against Warwickshire when he failed to score. In the 1967, he played a further six first-class matches and two List A games, without success, and he left the county staff at the end of the season.\nWilletts had a long career in second-class cricket. He joined Shropshire's Minor Counties team in 1968, moved back to Somerset's second eleven in the early 1970s and then went on from 1977 to Cornwall where, from 1988 to 1990, finishing at the age of 50, he was captain of the Minor Counties side. He appeared in one further List A match for Cornwall, in the first round of the 1980 Gillette Cup, when the Cornish side lost to Devon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Terry Willetts (1964\u20131967) 16 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Willetts", "response": ["* Terry Willetts (born 1939), English cricketer"]}]}}
