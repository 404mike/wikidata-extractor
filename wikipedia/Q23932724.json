He was the first Englishman to hold this position. Born in Braunston, Northamptonshire, Rushall was the eldest of eight children. After finishing school he left for sea, joined the UK's Merchant Navy, and became a ship's captain. He spent 20 years with the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, of which 17 were in command of steamships belonging to the company. In 1908 he settled in Rangoon with his family, resigned from the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company and founded Rushall & Co. Ltd., a stevedoring and contracting business that employed between 3,000 and 4,000 men.\nIn December 1922 Rushall was elected as an Honorary Magistrate, and was subsequently made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his distinguished service during the First World War. He was elected as mayor of Rangoon in January 1930, in an election that was described by Singapore's The Straits Times as having given \"universal satisfaction\". During his time as mayor, he sought to improve the accommodation and quality of care in the city hospital and to ensure that a fair share of stevedoring jobs in Rangoon were allotted to native dock labourers. During the Second World War Rushall evacuated to Bombay; he died at the age of 87 in Rangoon, where he was commended by U Kyaw Tha for his work and character as mayor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 19", "response": ["*1953 \u2013 Richard Rushall, British businessman (b. 1864)"]}, {"page": "March 6", "response": ["*1864 \u2013 Richard Rushall, British businessman (d. 1953)"]}, {"page": "1953", "response": ["* February 1 \u2013 Richard Rushall, British businessman (b. 1865)"]}, {"page": "Rushall", "response": ["*Richard Rushall (1864\u20131953), English businessman"]}, {"page": "1865", "response": ["* April \u2013 Richard Rushall, British sea captain and businessman (d. 1953)"]}, {"page": "Rushall, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Rushall"]}, {"page": "Rushall & Co.
