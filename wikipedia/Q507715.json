He tested negative for HIV fourteen months after three initial tests returned a positive result. While there have been anecdotal reports from Africa of people fighting off the virus, Stimpson's case was the first to have been medically documented and tested.\nAfter having contracted the disease from his HIV-positive boyfriend Juan Gomez, Stimpson first stated that he felt \"tired, weak and feverish\" and had three HIV antibody tests at the Victoria Clinic for Sexual Health in west London. In October 2003, Stimpson was offered another test, which came back negative. He claimed he was \"baffled\" and \"convinced there must have been a mistake\". He sued the hospital, but two later tests confirmed that both results were correct.\nAs Stimpson was in the early stages of HIV infection, he was not taking any medication, and was only prescribed daily supplements.\nWhile the hospital could not confirm if Stimpson has actually been cured of the disease, he has been urged to return for further tests in hope of reproducing the result in others.  Stimpson spent weeks meeting with some of the world's leading HIV specialists, immunologists and virologists. After many tests there was still no answer as to what had actually happened. All that he was told was that there were no mistakes and somehow during those fourteen months he had gone from HIV positive to HIV negative.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005", "response": ["* November 13 \u2013 Andrew Stimpson, a 25-year-old Scottish man, is reported as the first person proven to have been 'cured' of HIV."]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 13 November \u2013 Andrew Stimpson, a 25-year-old man from Scotland, is reported as the first person proven to have been \"cured\" of HIV."]}, {"page": "Andrew Stimpston", "response": ["#REDIRECTAndrew Stimpson"]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: Sj\u2013Sz", "response": ["| Andrew Stimpson"]}, {"page": "2005 in Scotland", "response": ["* 13 November \u2013 Andrew Stimpson, a 25-year-old man from Scotland, is reported as the first person proven to have been 'cured' of HIV."]}, {"page": "Stimpson, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Stimpson"]}]}}
