This arrangement remained until 10 June 1987 when the Burke Labor government, with the conditional support of the National Party, introduced the present system of multi-member electorates and a method of proportional representation which is, however, 'weighted' to give extra representation to rural constituents. The legislation was made possible because the Australian Democrats in 1986 negotiated an election preference flow to Labor in return for an explicit undertaking on Legislative Council electoral reform, which resulted in the defeat of a number of Liberal councillors who were committed to opposing such reform.Australian Democrats media statement by Jean Jenkins, 10 June 1987.Electoral Reform expected to alter balance of power, The Australian, 11 June 1987, p.5"]}, {"page": "Women in the Australian Senate", "response": ["|Jean Jenkins", "  from:1987 till:1990 color:AD text:\"Jean Jenkins (1987\u20131990)\""]}, {"page": "Bindoon, Western Australia", "response": ["In 1989, Senator Jean Jenkins, the Australian Democrats senator for Western Australia, raised the issue in the nation's Senate on behalf of the Child Migrant Friendship Society of Western Australia and a number of individual former child migrants who had asked for her support.Senate Adjournment debate, 17 August 1989 at Parliament of Australia"]}, {"page": "Welsh Australians", "response": ["|Jean Jenkins ||1938\u2013||former senator||migrated to Australia 1969||Welsh parents and upbringing"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 2004 Australian federal election", "response": ["|Brand || Labor || |Kim Beazley || Phil Edman || Jean Jenkins || John Partridge || Rajesh Vettoor || Gerard Kettle (Ind)Garth Stockden (ON)Rob Totten (CEC)"]}, {"page": "Mumbles (district)", "response": ["*Jean Jenkins, an Australian senator (1987\u20131990), was brought up in Mumbles."]}, {"page": "Jack Evans (Australian politician)", "response": ["For the following Senate election in 1987, the party's membership selected him as the No. 2 Senate candidate, precipitating a bitter dispute and a second preselection ballot from which the first ballot winner, Richard Jeffreys, was excluded.
