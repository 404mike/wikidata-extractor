The picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe now occupies the other side altar formerly dedicated to Saint Joseph. Also added in the 1970s were a baptismal font and two figured mahogany lecterns. Two of the four corner confessionals in Gothic style remain; the other two were ruined by termites and replaced with an Esquipula shrine and a replica of Michelangelo\u2019s Pieta. The bishop\u2019s throne and the communion rail were removed as part of the Vatican II reforms. Two iron Corinthian pillars have been added to the front portico. Three bishops are buried under the floor of the baptismal font: di Pietro, Frederick C. Hopkins, and William A. Rice. The steeples of the twin towers have been battered over the years. The original Byzantine onion domes were changed in the early 1900s to soaring, pyramidal steeples (at left) demolished by the 1931 hurricane. Their shorter replacements were blown away in subsequent storms. The bells are in one tower; four peel for joyous events; three for funerals alternating with all four; two for church services; and one for the Angelus at 6:00\u00a0a.m., noon, and 6:00\u00a0p.m.Abstracted entirely from: Woods, Charles M.
