This idea would later reappear in 1903 under the name of \"Fletcherizing\", derived from its author's name Horace Fletcher, \"a self-taught nutritionist\". Fletcher promoted chewing all food until it was thoroughly mixed with saliva, to the point that it was swallowed in a liquid state."]}, {"page": "Low-protein diet", "response": ["By studying the composition of food in the local population in Germany, Carl von Voit established a standard of 118 grams of protein per day.
