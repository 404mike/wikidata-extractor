From 1921-1930, Whitlock was assistant organist at Rochester Cathedral in Kent. He served as Director of Music at St Stephen's Church, Bournemouth for the next five years, combining this from 1932 with the role of that town's borough organist, in which capacity he regularly played at the local Pavilion Theatre. After 1935 he worked for the Pavilion Theatre full-time. A tireless railway enthusiast, he wrote at length and with skill about his interest. Sometimes, for both prose and music, he used the pseudonym \"Kenneth Lark.\" He worked closely with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra; the orchestra's conductor from 1935-1940 was Richard Austin, whose father Frederic Austin dedicated his Organ Sonata to Whitlock.\nWhitlock was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1928. Near the end of his life, he lost his sight altogether, and he died in Bournemouth a few weeks before his 43rd birthday. For decades afterwards he remained largely forgotten. This neglect has eased in recent times, in particular through the activities and publications of the Percy Whitlock Trust, founded in 1983. The Percy Whitlock Trust was wound up in 2017, due to the expiry of copyright on Whitlock's compositions, and its assets and archive transferred to the Royal College of Organists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chatham, Kent", "response": ["*Percy Whitlock, organist and post-romantic composer"]}, {"page": "Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["* Percy Whitlock: Symphony in G minor for organ and orchestra (1937)"]}, {"page": "1936 in music", "response": ["*Percy Whitlock \u2013 Sonata for Organ in C minor"]}, {"page": "1937 in music", "response": ["*Percy Whitlock\u00a0\u2013 Wessex Suite"]}, {"page": "Priory Records", "response": ["Other Organ collections include: the complete works by Olivier Messiaen performed by Dame Gillian Weir, \"Great Australasian Organs\", \"Victorian Organ Sonatas\", \"Christmas Organ Music\", \"Organ Master Series\", \"Organ Concertos\", \"Concert Hall Series\"; the \"Complete Organ Works\" by: Sigfrid Karg-Elert, Herbert Sumsion, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Eug\u00e8ne Gigout, Hubert Parry, Percy Whitlock, Frank Bridge, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Joseph Jongen, Kenneth Leighton, Henri Mulet, William Mathias, Samuel Sebastian Wesley.
