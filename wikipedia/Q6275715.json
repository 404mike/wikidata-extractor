He moved on to Port Vale in 2003, never having played for Newcastle or Carlisle. Three years later, he transferred to Macclesfield Town, where he became the first-choice keeper. Following this, he spent the 2010\u201311 campaign with Walsall. He then entered the non-league scene with Nantwich Town, before joining Stafford Rangers in July 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["Building for the 2003\u201304 campaign, Horton had to find a replacement for departing defender Matt Carragher. He found his replacement in Everton's reliable young George Pilkington; he also signed goalkeeper Jonny Brain and Austrian defender Andreas Lipa. By the start of the campaign Horton had completed the rebuilding of his squad that was necessitated by the financial crisis and the ageing of the highly successful side of the mid-1990s. A good start saw the club top of the table and Horton was named as Manager of the Month. The Vale were one point outside the play-offs by February, at which point Horton tendered his resignation.", "Despite high expectations, Horton's men were not to challenge for promotion in the 2005\u201306 season. The club were hit by financial troubles after being told they had to pay fines totalling \u00a3250,000, and at one point were at risk of being wound up. As a result, Horton was forced to cope without assistant John Askey, after Askey was dismissed to cut costs. The sale of top-scorer Jon Parkin also robbed Horton of his best player. Following a poor start to the season he placed four players on the transfer-list. He also placed Kevin Townson on the transfer-list, before sacking the striker after Townson displayed \"serious misconduct\". Throughout the campaign, Horton signed goalkeeper Tommy Lee, striker Clyde Wijnhard, midfielder Alan Navarro, forward Allan Russell, and striker Matty McNeil. The \"Silkmen\" finished in 17th-place, five points above the relegation zone. Horton prepared for the 2006\u201307 campaign by searching for a new midfield player, and found one in Shrewsbury Town's Jamie Tolley. He also signed versatile attacker Colin Heath, defender Carl Regan, and former Port Vale goalkeeper Jonny Brain; whilst releasing five players. Horton was sacked in October 2006, after his team failed to win any of their opening twelve league games, leaving them bottom of the Football League."]}, {"page": "Dean Delany", "response": ["During his four seasons with Port Vale he made 39 appearances in all competitions and was an unused substitute in the 2001 League Trophy final against Brentford at the Millennium Stadium.

He missed the entirety of the 2003\u201304 season due to his finger injury, and was forced to make his recovery in games held behind closed doors. A young Jonny Brain was signed to provide cover for Delany, but instead took his place as Vale's regular stopper during Goodlad's absence.

After playing for the youth team he then spent time on loan at La Louviere in Belgium in 2005 where he played twice in the Belgian top flight. Begovi\u0107 got his UK visa in the summer of 2006 which allowed him to sign on loan for Macclesfield Town in the 2006\u201307 season, making his Football League debut in a 1\u20131 draw at Stockport County on 25 November as an 80th minute substitute, after injury to first choice goalkeeper Jonny Brain. His loan spell was cut short, however, as he sustained a knee injury after making just three appearances. In August 2007, Begovi\u0107 was loaned to AFC Bournemouth in League One in a deal lasting until January 2008. He was recalled back from Bournemouth on 11 October 2007.
