Their purpose is simply to collect enough evidence to prove to their brethren that the claims of the Ori are false. Despite this, they do believe that the Ori are very powerful; it is only their intentions they doubt. Even though the group lives in the shadows of Ori society, they have collected a number of artifacts that they have kept hidden, since such pieces of technology contradict the book of Origin and thus would be destroyed if discovered.

Apparently Tomin told him they were from far away but just not how far (another galaxy).  In order to give him proof of their story, Daniel, Vala and Tomin take him to the Odyssey which is in orbit which is proof enough for him.

In the 14th episode of the show's eighth season, \"Requiem\", portrayed by Chris Gauthier. Winslow Schott is depicted as a toymaker and former Queen Industries employee with a grudge against Oliver Queen. He was a scientific inventor at STAR Labs who was hired by Oliver to work for Queen Industries. A great mind, though a bit eccentric, he expressed his individuality by bringing toys to work. However, he went too far when he began putting explosives in them, which lead to his immediate termination from the company. He is later revealed to be working for Lex Luthor, disfigured, partially crippled, and hiding in a mobile base. He speaks to Luthor through a camera and microphone concealed in a wooden doll's head, and used toys such as an exploding Newton's cradle, knockout gas-filled Mylar balloons, and an explosive cymbal-clanging monkey. After he failed twice to kill Oliver, he escaped police custody. Oliver destroyed Lex's mobile base with one of the Toyman's toys in order to frame Schott, which forced him to become a fugitive. While Clark Kent referred to him as the \"Toyman\", Schott was mostly referred to as the Toymaker and the \"Toyboy\". In the season nine episode, \"Echo\", referred to as the Toyman by himself, Clark, Chloe Sullivan, and the Daily Planet, Schott attempted to test Clark by saving a group of hostages he had kidnapped from a bomb, which Clark succeeded in doing. Later in the episode, he attempted to kill Oliver once more after being framed for Lex's demise. After Schott is apprehended and faced with solitary confinement, Tess Mercer visited Schott in jail to give him John Corben's kryptonite-powered heart to study. This episode also featured an android version of Schott that was used in his plot. The Toyman makes his final appearance in Smallvilles penultimate episode \"Prophecy\". Despite still being in jail, he created Marionette Ventures, an organization composed of Metallo, Roulette, the Dark Archer, Black Manta, Captain Cold and Solomon Grundy that worked to control Smallville's waterfront properties. The Toyman used a brainwashed Courtney Whitmore to do his organization's bidding. Following a series of failures with one of them controlling Lois Lane, Clark confronted the Toyman, broke his special cellphone, and assured him he would always stop him."]}, {"page": "Earthsea (miniseries)", "response": ["Combining the plots of the first and second novel, the story follows Ged (Shawn Ashmore), a powerful but reckless mage-in-training, and Tenar (Kristin Kreuk), a young priestess, who are drawn together in a battle against the ancient race of demons known as the Nameless Ones.
