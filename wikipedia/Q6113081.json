During 1986 and 1987, quality problems with the economics statistics produced by the CSO, due partly to the effects of deregulation and to changes to the structure of the economy, became apparent. A review conducted by Stephen Pickford made a number of recommendations for further research and more significantly, recommended greater centralisation of work on economic statistics. Consequently, the Business Statistics Office, most of the two statistics divisions responsible for data on imports and exports at the Department of Trade and Industry, and the statistics division responsible for the Retail Prices Index at the Department of Employment were merged with the CSO in 1989. An improvement programme followed in 1990 at the request of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, which focused on the national accounts and the balance of payments. In November 1991 the CSO was launched as an executive agency, detached from the Cabinet Office, which helped to put focus on the quality of service provided and gave an opportunity to restate publicly the arrangements to ensure the integrity of official statistics."]}, {"page": "Hibbert", "response": ["* Jack Hibbert (footballer) (1869\u2013unknown), English professional footballer", "* Sir Jack Hibbert (1932\u20132005), British statistician"]}, {"page": "Leeds Grammar School", "response": ["* Sir Jack Hibbert - director of the Central Statistical Office, 1985-92."]}, {"page": "Robert McCrae", "response": ["He played his debut League match for Burnley on 3 November 1888 at Turf Moor, Burnley.

Apart from some good work by Burnley goalkeeper Fred Poland the Burnley defence had a nightmare match. Burnley were three down by the half-hour but Burnley got one back before half-time.
