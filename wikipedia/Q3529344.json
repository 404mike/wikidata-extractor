Born in Blofield, Norfolk, Edrich came from a cricketing family, his four cousins, Eric Edrich, Bill Edrich, Geoff Edrich and Brian Edrich, all having played first-class cricket. He was educated at the private Bracondale School between the ages of eight and seventeen, during which time he played cricket at weekends and was coached by former cricketer C. S. R. Boswell.\nEdrich played for Surrey and England. He was renowned for playing the cut, the cover drive and scoring off his legs, earning over the years a reputation for dogged fearlessness. His statistical achievements show that he was amongst the best players of his generation, playing a total of seventy-seven Test matches for England between 1963 and 1976, and scoring a triple-century in 1965 that is the fifth highest Test score for England. It contained 57 boundaries, which is still a record for any Test innings. A player during the time when One Day International cricket was in its infancy, he played, and top scored, in the first ever ODI match. The cricket writer Colin Bateman described him as \"unflinching, unselfish, and often unsmiling while going about his business in the middle, he was a fiercely formidable opener who knew his limitations and worked wonderfully within them\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ashes", "response": ["In 1970\u201371, Ray Illingworth led England to a 2\u20130 win in Australia, mainly due to John Snow's fast bowling, and the prolific batting of Geoffrey Boycott and John Edrich. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.Harte, pp. 526\u2013530."]}, {"page": "June 21", "response": ["*1937 \u2013 John Edrich, English cricketer and coach (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["Cowdrey took the next two matches off (which were drawn), but was with Fred Titmus when the off-spinner had four toes cut off by a boat propeller while swimming and drove him to the hospital for surgery, which enabled him to return to cricket after the tour. The Third Test at Bridgetown was a dull draw, with Sobers winning the toss and the West Indies making 349, followed by 449 from England with Boycott (146) and John Edrich (90) adding 172 for the 1st wicket. They returned to Port of Spain for the Fourth Test, Sobers won the toss again and his team made 526/7. England replied with 404, Cowdrey top-scoring with 148 and hitting 21 boundaries. The game looked doomed to another draw when Sobers suddenly declared at 92/2 on the fifth day, leaving England 215 runs to win in 165 minutes. Sobers disliked the thought of playing out five draws in a series and remembered the sudden English collapse in the Third Test which might give him a surprise victory. Though he needed Tom Graveney and Ken Barrington to overcome his natural inclination to safely they set about the runs with Boycott holding up one end with 80 not out and adding 118 in 75 minutes with Cowdrey (71) for a 7 wicket victory with three minutes to spare. Sobers was lambasted throughout the West Indies for his declaration and Cowdrey found him drinking alone in a bar that evening when he was usually surrounded by fans. For years afterwards West Indian captains such as Clive Lloyd and Viv Richards delayed declaring until defeat was impossible so as not to repeat the mistake. ", "Cowdrey showed he had lost none of his timing and that his bat was as straight as ever until he was bowled behind his legs by Thomson (2/45) for 22. In the second innings he volunteered to open with David Lloyd instead of the badly bruised Brian Luckhurst. Cowdrey was dropped by Ian Redpath off Lillee, hit on the arm, survived a confident appeal by Rod Marsh before he was finally caught lbw by Thomson for 41, his highest score of the series. After the Second Test Cowdrey made 78 and took 2/27 against South Australia. Before the Third Test at Melbourne Frank Tyson recalled \"Colin Cowdrey and John Edrich were unable to practice on Christmas Eve \u2013 mainly because of the drizzling rain but also because Cowdrey wanted to spend his birthday in comparative peace. Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two-hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen old son, Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents\".Tyson, p. 85 He played his 114th and last Test at Melbourne, and opened the innings again as Lloyd was injured, but only made 7. Even so, England made 529 and won by an innings, with Cowdrey dismissing Rick McCosker for his 120th catch. He was given a warm farewell by his fans in \"an impromptu little gathering on the outfield in front of the banner reading 'M.C.G. FANS THANK COLIN \u2013 6 TOURS'. The central figure, wearing a large straw sun-hat, was signing endless autographs, posing for photographs and exchanging friendly talk with young and old in the way that has made him as popular a cricketer as has ever visited Australia\".Swanton, p. 183"]}, {"page": "John Snow (cricketer)", "response": ["Along with Ray Illingworth, Geoff Boycott and John Edrich, John Snow declined to tour India in 1972\u201373, wanting to rest his back for the summer and concerned about the dysentery he had caught in Pakistan in 1968\u201369.p135-136, Snow Tony Lewis led the team, but lost 2\u20131 and Illingworth was re-appointed captain against New Zealand in 1973.

Geoff Arnold took the most wickets with 16 (21.93) and Snow's 13 wickets (24.61) suffered in comparison, but he returned 4\u201332 in England's 5 wicket win in the One Day International at Swansea.", "As he could not tour the West Indies Snow toured with D.H. Robin's XI in South Africa with John Edrich and John Gleeson under the leadership of Brian Close, who was a strong advocate of maintaining cricketing ties. Despite playing two \"Tests\" against a South African Invitation XI the tour did not produce the strong reaction encountered by the \"Rebel\" tours of the 1980s. Snow took 18 wickets (22.83) including 4/91 in the Durban \"Test\", they beat Natal and Eastern Province and drew the other games.", "Trent Bridge (1/123), but fought back in the second innings (4/53) with the wickets of Roy Fredericks, Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd and Bernard Julien.

Umpire Dickie Bird had to use his cap to scare away the pigeons that kept flying down to eat them.p66, Bird, 1997. In the end the veterans John Edrich and Brian Close grimly held out for a draw amongst fast, short-pitched bowling. Snow struck again at Lord's with 4/68 as he and Underwood (5/39) shot the tourists out for 182, but asked to make 332 to win they held out for 241/6. Snow was dropped for the Third Test at Old Trafford, which England lost by 425 runs, but was recalled for his final Test at Headingley. Here he reduced the West Indians from 413\u20135 to 450 all out with 4/77, including his 200th Test wicket, Andy Roberts, but took only 2/82 in the second and England lost by 55 runs."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Boycott", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left\" | John Edrich"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  John Edrich"]}, {"page": "England cricket team", "response": ["The 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts.

However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1\u20130 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India.

In 1969, Surrey employed their very first overseas player: the very popular Pakistani leg break bowler Intikhab Alam. In addition to Intikhab, the Surrey attack in their Championship-winning side possessed four current or future England Test cricketers in Geoff Arnold, Robin Jackman, Bob Willis and Pat Pocock. Edrich was subsequently appointed captain in 1973 and led Surrey to second position in the County Championship in his first year in charge and then secured Surrey their first limited overs silverware the following year with victory in the Benson and Hedges Cup. Edrich's replacement as captain, Roger Knight, led Surrey to NatWest Trophy glory at Lord's in 1982. Following Intikhab Alam, other overseas players to appear for the county included the talented New Zealand opening batsman Geoff Howarth and two extremely fearsome fast bowlers, the West Indian Sylvester Clarke and the young Pakistani Waqar Younis.", "*  John Edrich"]}, {"page": "List of One Day International cricket records", "response": ["| John Edrich|| || 24 August 1972|| 1 year, 232 days", "| 5 January 1971 || John Edrich ||  ||  || Scorecard ||"]}, {"page": "Dennis Lillee", "response": ["The following season, Lillee made his Test debut in the Sixth Test at Adelaide in the 1970\u201371 Ashes series, taking 5/84 from 28.3 eight-ball overs.
