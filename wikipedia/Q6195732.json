A subsequent investigation headed by NYPD detective Thomas F. Byrnes revealed that Patrick Shevlin, a bank watchman, had given them access to the building. Shevlin confessed under questioning that he had obtained duplicate keys and given them detailed information about the bank. He also specifically identified Hope as the leader of the gang. The ten members of the gang, including Hope and his son John, were arrested in different parts of the country and brought back to New York to stand trial. Both he and John Hope were convicted, along with Bill Kelly, but the rest of the gang were discharged from custody. Jimmy Hope was sent back to Auburn Prison but escaped within the year. Jimmy Hope swore until his death that his son John had no involvement in the robbery and had been wrongfully imprisoned."]}, {"page": "Jim Hope", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jimmy Hope (footballer)"]}]}}
