Alexander writes that it also suggests that the youth is not \"rough and uncouth, but kind,\" and is therefore more likely to attract sexual attention and be too kind to turn it away.  Note the proverb used twice by Shakespeare, \"She's beautiful; and therefore to be Wooed: /She is a Woman; therefore to be Wonne,\" (Henry VI, 5.3.78-79) and \"Shee is a woman, therefore may be woo'd, /Shee is a woman, therefore may be wonne,\" (Titus Andronicus, 2.1.83-84) altered slightly in lines 5-6 of the sonnet.

Atkins. \"Sonnet 41.\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary. Madison: Fairleigh Dickinson UP, 2007. 122. Print.  The final excuse for the youth's infidelity is that no man can resist the advances of a woman.  Alexander argues that the observation that end the first eight lines of the poem is much more pointed than that.  \"To imply that men cannot be expected to resist women because their mothers were women is such nonsense that it is an excuse which excuses nothing.\"  Most early editors emend the \"he\" to \"she\" in line eight, with the suggestion by Thomas Tyrwhitt that \"the lady, and not the man, being in this case supposed the wooer, the poet without doubt wrote...she.\"  However, modern editors follow more in line with Martin Seymour-Smith who notes: \"The man 'prevails' in the sexual sense...so that the usual emendation 'she' for 'he' is unnecessary and wrong.  The woman wants the man to prevail.\"  Regarding lines 7\u20138, Duncan-Jones remarks: \"Though this sounds like an obvious truism, Shakespeare's first published work, (Venus and Adonis), described a 'woman's son', Adonis, who refuses the advances of the goddess of love.\""]}, {"page": "International Linguistics Olympiad", "response": ["IOL 11 was held from July 22 to 26, 2013, at the Manchester Grammar School, Manchester, UK.
