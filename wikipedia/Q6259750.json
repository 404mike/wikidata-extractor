Between 1827 and 1828, John Sartain apprenticed under Richter. In 1823, the 14-year-old Sartain had sought become an experienced engraver under the indenture of John Swaine of the Merchant and Tailors Company. in 1828, Sartain continued his apprenticeship under Richter. By now he was an experienced engraver and Richter gave him his first attempt at \"stipple on steel\" or Mezzotint that was titled \"Omphale\". Around that time, Richter had painted The Tight Shoe and had requested that Sartain do the engraving. Sartain did so, then later did additional engravings after he went to the US. Richter had hoped that Sartain would also do the engraving for his painting, The Brute of a Husband, but their relationship had soured and Sartain left Richter's employ to go out on his own. Between 1829 and 1830, Sartain was self-employed in London before leaving for Philadelphia and becoming very well known and respected in the US. From 1829 until his death, Richter he was both a member and a frequent exhibitor of the Society of Painters in Water Colours. The subject's of his most ambitious paintings of this later phase were taken from Shakespeare. He was also known for drawings and engravings of characters of Sir Walter Scott.The University of Edinburgh image collection"]}, {"page": "Swaine, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Swaine"]}]}}
