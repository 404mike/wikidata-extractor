By analyzing the mortuary dress and the material objects in the tomb, scholars concluded that Queen Puabi maintained a high-status. Queen Puabi was roughly forty years old at the time of her death and five feet tall. The difficulty in re-constructing Queen Puabi's appearance stemmed from the lack of knowledge about female Mesopotamian aesthetics. Although scholars were missing this information, that did not impede Katharine Woolley and one of the Penn Museum's curators, Father Leon Legrain, from giving Queen Puabi a face (and adding make-up). Dr. Legrain modeled his reconstruction of Queen Puabi on the sculpture from Tello (Girsu), \u201cla femme a l\u2019echarpe,\u201d which was created 500 years after the her life. The controversial reconstruction was eventually retracted and replaced with a faceless mannequin to avoid the controversial assumptions about Sumerian aesthetics.   "]}]}}
