Ejected from his positions for nonconformity, he became a minister serving the English-speaking community in the Netherlands. He was a staunch proponent of Presbyterianism and an opponent of separatism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Paget (Puritan minister)", "response": ["John Paget remained in post until 1637, when he became emeritus. It is possible that he was already ill. Samuel Hartlib heard in July 1638 that Paget was recovering from an illness.Hartlib Papers, Ref: 11/1/117A-B However he died only about a month later, on 18 August 1638, probably in the vicinity of Amsterdam. Thomas Paget (d. 1660), his brother, then served the English Church at Amsterdam, alongside Julines Herring,Steven, p. 279. until he returned to England in 1646 to become incumbent of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury."]}, {"page": "Nathan Paget", "response": ["With John Paget's death, the Paget family in Amsterdam dispersed. His widow Briget became his literary executor and went to live with her adopted son, Robert, in Dordrecht. Thomas had already taken over as pastor of the English Reformed Church, where he was assisted by Julines Herring, a comrade of the struggles in Cheshire and formerly public preacher in Shrewsbury. Urwick, p. ix.Coulton, p. 78-80. On 25 November 1638 Nathan entered as a student of medicine at the University of Leyden: his surname was badly Latinised at admission to Pagelius.Peacock, p. 75. The University was probably the best of the Netherlands' five provincial universities,Boxer, p. 176. and the one most involved in the country's colonial aspirations and international mission: in the quarter century 1626\u201350 52% of its students came from abroad.Boxer, p. 177. It was also active in other areas of Paget's intellectual interest: Joseph Justus Scaliger had established a strong tradition of Semitic studies and the university had acquired an Oriental press, complete with appropriate fonts, in 1625. Paget graduated M.D. on 3 August 1639. His thesis was published under the title De Peste (On the Plague). He dedicated it to various Puritans of Cheshire and Shropshire and in it described himself as Mancestr. Anglus.,Booker, p. 67. a Mancunian and Englishman."]}, {"page": "Katherine Chidley", "response": ["Following the birth of the second Daniel, and possibly at earlier births, Katherine Chidley refused to undergo the Churching of women, a service prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. She was not alone in this: the ceremony was suspect to Puritans, even of the fairly moderate kind. Particularly resented was the use of , with its striking spell-like verse 6, \"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.\" Katherine, along with Judith Wright and five other women, was cited for refusing to be churched by the Peter Studley, the High Church incumbent of St Chad's, later in the year, during a canonical visitation under Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Judith was the wife of George Wright, sometime bailiff of Shrewsbury, and the couple had son, Joshua, baptised on 25 April 1625:Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 47. George Wright was one of the relatively small number accorded the title of Mr. in the register, showing that he was regarded as socially superior to artisans like Daniel Chidley. However, he was cited for allowing meetings to hear sermons and sing hymns in his home on Sunday evenings, and it is known that these were centred on Julines Herring, the town's public preacher, of whom the Wrights were key supporters.Clarke. p. 464. Studley deferred to Morton's judgement: \"whether Action of gathering together may be termed a conventicle we refer to your honorable court to judge and determine.\"Coulton, p. 82. Katherine and her husband were also among twenty parishioners presented to the Consistory court for failure to attend church. This may suggest that they had already sought to form a conventicle or separatist group. However, William Rowley, another former bailiff, was cited with them, although he was certainly not a separatist but a leader of the Puritan faction on the corporation and a close supporter of the Presbyterian Herring.", "acted within these four last years in England\u2026\" Chidley is featured only twice in a very long and rambling book but in one of these Edwards does refer pointedly to the title of his book: Julines Herring, who had died the previous year in Amsterdam, is credited with using the image of gangrene earlier in his references specifically to the Chidleys. Edwards portrays Chidley as bitterly sectarian, narrating an incident he claimed had taken place at Stepney Meeting House, where the moderate Independent William Greenhill was pastor."]}, {"page": "Humphrey Fenn", "response": ["His will, made in 1631, was prefaced by \u2018so full and so open a protestation against the hierarchy and the ceremonies, that the prelatical party would not suffer it to be put among the records of the court when the will was tendred to be proved\u2019 (Clark, in Life of Julines Herring). On 21 Feb. 1634 a copy of the introduction to the will of \u2018Humphrey Fen the eldest\u2019 was received by Archbishop Laud from the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. This preamble (only) was printed as \u2018The Last Will and Testament with the Profession of Faith of Humphrey Fenn,\u2019 &c., 1641, sm. 8vo (no place of printing)."]}, {"page": "Samuel Fisher (died 1681)", "response": ["Despite the mystery as to his activities in this period, Fisher did make a significant public impact on Friday 20 September 1633, when he preached a sermon in Shrewsbury. The previous week had seen a canonical visitation by Bishop Robert Wright, which had been used to enforce and to propagate High Church ideas and practices. It had provided support for Peter Studley, the very divisive curate or incumbent of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, who hosted the bishop as preacher in his church on 8 September, speaking on obedience to the king as a religious duty. The bishop dined with Studley, who concluded matters a week later by publicly reading out a list of injunctions on church fittings and decorations. Fisher's sermon was probably intended as a counter-blast to this Laudian triumphalism. He attacked the enforced conformity to Laudian norms, which he considered a threat to the \"free passage of out blessed Gospel\" and potentially a path to a restoration of popery.Coulton, pp. 86\u20137. He probably spoke in St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury, which was in the gift of the town's corporation and could provide a platform for a guest preacher: the Puritan incumbent at the time, who had probably secured the services of Fisher, was the James Betton. Another possibility is an invitation from the Puritan Julines Herring, appointed the town's public preacher at St Alkmund's Church in 1618Coulton, p. 75. but a parishioner of St Mary's.Coulton, p. 79."]}, {"page": "Humphrey Mackworth (Parliamentarian)", "response": ["The conquest of power by Mackworth and the committee allowed them to carry out a thorough purge, reversing the expulsions of puritan clergy of the late 1630s and of 1642. The incumbents at Holy Cross (the parish church on the site of Shrewsbury Abbey, St Mary's and St Chad's, and the head of Shrewsbury school, were all expelled and replaced by reliable puritans.Auden (1907), p. 262. Julines Herring, who had previously been public preacher in the town, was invited to return from his exile in Amsterdam but was already dying. The purge was extended into the rural areas, with Studley being expelled from his living at Pontesbury. St Chad's elected its own minister:Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 216. Thomas Paget, a committed Presbyterian who had submitted a book defending this form of church government to Parliament in 1641.Coulton, p. 106. He probably played a leading role in drawing up plans for the Presbyterian organisation of the Church of England in Shropshire and Mackworth must have at least approved them, as he was by far the strongest voice in the government of the county, as well as a leading member of Paget's congregation."]}, {"page": "Thomas Paget (Puritan minister)", "response": ["Thomas Paget and his children took up residence in Amsterdam and lived among expatriate and exiled English-speaking Protestants. They looked on the surrounding Dutch community and the Presbyterians of Scotland as allies in the Calvinist cause. The eldest son, Nathan, was sent for his higher education first to the University of Edinburgh and later to Leiden University. John Paget was greatly involved in polemics against an emerging Independent or Congregationalist strain among the English Calvinists. Elements in his congregation proposed bringing in Thomas Hooker and John Davenport as assistant ministers to balance Paget's determined Presbyterianism. It is unclear exactly how Thomas made a living, but it is known that John Paget and his wife Briget were wealthy, with two houses in Amsterdam and shares in the state-sponsored Dutch West India Company, which made large profits from the Atlantic slave trade. Thomas was evidently well-enough provided for to remarry and a son, named Thomas, was born in 1635. Another minister in the Amsterdam church alongside the Pagets was the veteran Julines Herring, who had served at Shrewsbury, where he clashed with Bishop Morton, and at Wrenbury,Urwick, p. 138. where he was one of the Cheshire ministers persecuted by Bridgeman.", "Probably in 1645 Paget became aware of overtures from Shrewsbury. The town had fallen to the Parliamentarians as a result of a daring operation planned by Willem Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier, under the direction of its parliamentary committee, on 21 February.Coulton, p. 103-4. Royalist and Laudian clergy were purged from the town and the surrounding areas and replacements sought. Initially the centre of interest in Amsterdam was Julines Herring, who was probably invited back by Thomas Rowley,Coulton, p. 105. the merchant and former bailiff who had first introduced him to Shrewsbury around 1617.Coulton, p. 78. However, both Rowley and Herring were dead by the summer of 1645. Attention then turned to Paget: presumably Herring had recommended him. Some time in 1646 the congregation of St Chad's Church elected him as their minister, \"for this was now become the mode of appointment,\"Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 216. as Owen and Blakeway, both later Anglican clergymen in the town, remark in their 1825 History of Shrewsbury. The previous incumbent was one Lendall (forename unknown),Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 215. who was perhaps appointed under the first royalist governor, Sir Francis Ottley. He seems to have been treated as a prisoner of war on the capture of the townOwen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 455-6. and removed under an Act of 16 December 1642 ordering sequestration of the livings of those who joined the king's army.Auden, p. 253."]}, {"page": "Margaret Bromley", "response": ["This she did essentially by providing accommodation for persecuted ministers and a platform for their preaching, and by making her home available for religious exercises held by what appear to have been regional networks of Puritan ministers. Of those mentioned by Clark and Brook, Julines Herring seems to have been central: he was the public preacher appointed to St Alkmund's Church, Shrewsbury, by the town's corporation; John Ball was an old friend of Herring, ordained alongside himClarke, p. 462. by an Irish bishop in 1610 to avoid subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles;Clarke, p.442. Robert Nicolls of Wrenbury was Herring's brother-in-law;Clarke, p.467. Thomas Pierson of Brampton Bryan was one of the ministers Herring invited, along with Nicolls, to preach in Shrewsbury.Clarke, p. 464. Another who took refuge at Sheriffhales was Thomas Langley of Middlewich.Urwick, p. xii, note 2. Nicolls had clashed with the ecclesiastical authorities over ceremonial practice since Thomas Morton's time as Bishop of Chester. He died while taking refuge at Sheriffhales in 1630,Urwick, p. 474Brook, p. 375. leaving polemical writings that would not be published until 1660, attacking in particular signing with the Cross in baptism, the surplice and kneeling to receive Communion.Brook, p. 376."]}, {"page": "Samuel Chidley", "response": ["Daniel and Katherine Chidley were denounced as separatists by the Puritan public preacher of Shrewsbury, Julines Herring,Clarke. p. 465. and this separatism may account for their reluctance to have their children baptised at their parish church. However, by 1629 St Chad's had baptised a further seven Chidley children and buried one, Daniel, who died in infancy.Coulton, p. 82-3. The second Daniel's baptism was recorded on 12 February 1626,Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 46. and after this birth, at least, Katherine refused to undergo the Churching of women, although this may not have been the first time, and she was not unique. She and six other women were cited for refusing to take part later in the year during an episcopal visitation.Coulton, p. 83. This was part of protracted hostilities between the High Church incumbent, Peter Studley, and his Puritan parishioners in which both the separatists and the moderate Presbyterians around Herring were accused of absenting themselves from the Eucharist and setting up conventicles."]}, {"page": "Julines Hering", "response": ["#REDIRECT Julines Herring"]}]}}
