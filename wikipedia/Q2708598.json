Identical twins who are reared apart from birth had the same chance of being as similar in behavioral and psychological traits as twins who were raised together. It is increasingly understood that environmental effects are mostly random, rather than systematic effects of parenting or culture.|alt=Nature versus nurture is a long-standing debate in biology about the balance between two competing factors which determine fate: environment (nurture) and genetics (nature). The alliterative expression \"nature and nurture\" in English has been in use since at least the Elizabethan periodIn English at least since Shakespeare (The Tempest 4.1: a born devil, on whose nature nurture can never stick) and Richard Barnfield (Nature and nurture once together met / The soule and shape in decent order set.); in the 18th century used by Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke (Roach v. Garvan, \"I appointed therefore the mother guardian, who is properly so by nature and nurture, where there is no testamentary guardian.\") and goes back to medieval French.English usage is based on a tradition going back to medieval literature, where the opposition of nature (\"instinct, inclination\")  norreture (\"culture, adopted mores\") is a common motif, famously in Chretien de Troyes' Perceval, where the hero's effort to suppress his natural impulse of compassion in favor of what he considers proper courtly behavior leads to catastrophe.
