Several years after his death, a small monument was constructed in his place of burial, St Cynhaearn's Church. Over a hundred years after Ystumllyn's death, the Welsh writer Robert Isaac Jones published an account of Ystumllyn's life, compiled from various local oral records. This work, while also criticised for its \"forgetfulness\" and \"racial stereotyping\", serves as \"the most informative\" extant source of Ystumllyn's life. According to Jones, Ystumllyn was \"a very honest man, with no malice, and was respected by the gentry and the common people alike\".", "The final of these sources is a short Welsh-language pamphlet, John Ystumllyn neu 'Jack Black' (1888), by the Tremadog writer, Robert Isaac Jones (1813\u20131905), published under his bardic name, Alltud Eifion. Writing 102 years after Ystumllyn's death, Jones collated the various oral traditions of John that had passed down through his family, largely from his grandfather who had been Ystumllyn's doctor near the end of the gardener's life. This publication was subsequently adapted into Jones' Y Gestiana (1892), and translated into English by the canon, Tom Morris. Green has acknowledged the inadequacies of Jones' work, often \"prone to variation, embroidery and forgetfulness\", but it remains, in his view, \"the most informative\" and \"frank\" source for Ystumllyn's life. The work has received more harsh criticism from the North Wales newspaper, The Daily Post, as \"peppered with racial stereotyping\" in its biography of Ystumllyn, citing it in an editorial as an example of the early racial prejudice against black integration in Wales.", "Robert Isaac Jones begins his account of Ystumllyn's life, admitting his uncertain origins, and tracing three narratives of his arrival in Wales."]}, {"page": "Alltud Eifion", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Isaac Jones"]}]}}
