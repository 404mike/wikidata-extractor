He went to school at Northampton Grammar School and then King's College School. He was initially interested in studying law but the death of his father made him study chemistry from his uncle Charles Bloxam at King's College and became an assistant to Heinrich Debus (1824\u20131915) studying sulphur compounds and later under Vivian Lewes, both at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. In 1901 he applied for a position at the Madras Presidency College but this was cancelled when the former holder of the position returned from sick leave.
