Elizabeth appointed thirteen Commissioners, any three of whom could approve the statutes, and also confirmed Bevans as Principal.Hardy, pp. 25\u201326 Thereafter Griffith Powell, a former student of the college who had been elected to a fellowship in 1589, drafted some statutes and attempted to have them confirmed by the new Commissioners.Hardy, p. 29 However, neither Bevans nor his successor John Williams pressed for statutes to be confirmed.  In their absence, the Principal had an autocratic position.Hardy, p. 28Hardy, p. 30 Powell's view was that successive Principals were \"loath to have any statutes at all\", since their power would be \"limited\" by them. Bevans took Powell's draft to his residence in Hereford, where he stayed for several years and lost the copy. In 1595, Powell took another copy to John Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury and chief Commissioner, who rebuked Bevans for not attempting to obtain statutes.  Whitgift passed the draft to two other Commissioners in turn, Gabriel Goodman, the Dean of Westminster, and Herbert Westphaling, Bishop of Hereford.  Westphaling signed the draft in June 1601.  With two more signatures still being required, the statutes were sent to John Herbert in 1602. However, Williams took the draft statutes away before Herbert approved them, and kept them in his study until 1609 without making further attempts to have them confirmed.Hardy, p. 31", "|Gabriel Goodman"]}]}}
