He was a right-handed batsman who scored 45 runs at 11.25 with a best of 22, and a right arm fast-medium bowler, who bowled 16.2 overs for 43 runs without success.Baker was born in Hunmanby, Yorkshire, England, and made his debut against Middlesex at the Prince's Ground, Chelsea in May 1874 and scored nine, opening Yorkshire's first innings.  He dropped down the order for the second innings, but was instrumental in sealing the Tykes' five wicket win, putting on an unbeaten 28 for the sixth wicket in partnership with Allen Hill. His second appearance was also against Middlesex in the return game at Scarborough in September.  Batting down at number 8, he hit his career high of 22 in Yorkshire's first innings of 172, but did not bat again as the game was drawn, with Middlesex fighting back after following on, 112 runs behind.\nBaker's last appearance came a year later against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) when he recorded a duck at number seven in the first innings.  He was promoted to open second time around, but was run out for two, before Emmett and Ephraim Lockwood secured the draw.\nBaker died in June 1896 in Scarborough, Yorkshire, aged 46.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Baker", "response": ["Robert Baker may refer to:", "* Robert Baker (actor) (born 1979), American actor known from Grey's Anatomy and Out of Time", "* Robert Baker (cricketer) (1849\u20131896), British player for Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "* Robert Baker (gridiron football) (born 1976), former American professional football player in the US and Canada", "* Robert Baker (ice hockey) (1926\u20132012), American ice hockey player", "* Robert Baker (New York politician) (1862\u20131943), U.S. Representative from New York (1903\u20131905)", "* Robert Baker (explorer), English voyager to Guinea in 1562\u20131563", "* Robert Baker (scientist) (1938\u20132004), English metallurgist and steelmaker", "* Robert Baker (gunsmith), allegedly invented Daniel Boone's Gun, the Long Rifle", "* Robert Baker Aitken (1917\u20132010), American Zen teacher", "* James Robert Baker (1947\u20131997), American author", "* Robert Baker Girdlestone (1836\u20131923), English priest, scholar, and first principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford"]}, {"page": "Robert Baker (cricket)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Baker (cricketer)"]}]}}
