After a conviction for libel the same year, Beamish fled Britain and began a career of touring speaker, travelling to Germany, Canada, the United States or Japan in order to promote antisemitic and fascist causes. In 1923, he spoke at one of Adolf Hitler's meetings in Munich, and met Julius Streicher in Nuremberg in 1937. Beamish settled in Southern Rhodesia in 1938, where he served as an independent Member of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly between 1938 and 1940, then was interned for three years during the Second World War due to his pro-Nazi sentiments. Upon his release, Beamish returned to England and died in March 1948, aged 74.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beamish", "response": ["*Henry Hamilton Beamish (1873\u20131948), British racist and Rhodesian politician"]}, {"page": "Adrien Arcand", "response": ["Arcand was always a staunch federalist and an anglophile. He received secret funds from Lord Sydenham of Combe, former governor of Bombay and a prominent fascist sympathizer in the British Conservative Party after he translated into French Sydenham's pamphlet \"The Jewish World Problem\". He also maintained correspondence with Arnold Spencer Leese, chief of the Imperial Fascist League. Arcand was most strongly influenced by British fascism as he maintained an active correspondence with various British fascists such as Lord Sydenham, Henry Hamilton Beamish and Admiral Sir Barry Domvile. With the aim of forming a fascist leadership for the British empire, Arcand started a correspondence that continued until his death with Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Many of the articles that appeared in Le Fasciste Canadien were translations of articles from Action and Blackshirt, the two journals of the BUF.", "In 1934, Arcand established the Parti National Social Chr\u00e9tien (Christian National Social Party), which advocated anti-communism and the banishment of Canadian Jews to the Hudson Bay area. The latter idea was inspired by his friend, noted British Rhodesian fascist Henry Hamilton Beamish, who suggested sending Jews to Madagascar. In 1935 the desperate Bennett ministry again turned to Arcand, who was appointed at the urging of Senator Rainville to the post of Tory publicity director in Quebec. However, many of Arcand's friends were more sympathetic to the Reconstruction Party, so Le Patriote supported H. H. Stevens while its editor was campaigning for Bennett.Betcherman, Lita-Rose (1975). The Swastika and the Maple Leaf: Fascist Movements in Canada in the Thirties; Fitzhenry & Whiteside, p.43-43. Bennett secretly hired Arcand as his chief electoral organizer in Quebec for the 1935 federal election."]}, {"page": "Arnold Leese", "response": ["Leese joined the Centre International d'\u00c9tudes sur le Fascisme (CINEF), an international 'think tank' based in Switzerland whose aim was the promotion of fascism, and served as its British correspondent. He also became close to one of his neighbours, the economist Arthur Kitson, a member of The Britons. Their friendship lasted until Kitson's death in 1937. The latter persuaded Leese that control of money was the key to power and that money was ultimately controlled by the Jews. Kitson supplied him with a copy of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, on which Leese wrote, \"Everything in this little book rang true, I simply could not put it down until I had finished it.\" Leese also revered The Britons' founder Henry Hamilton Beamish as an anti-Jewish \"pioneer\". In 1924, he was elected a councillor to Stamford Town Council along with fellow fascist Harry Simpson, becoming the first elected fascist councillors in Britain. The British Fascists had generally chosen not to intervene in \"the despised democratic system\", and Leese's own contempt for democracy seems to have been paradoxically reinforced by the election. He wrote, \"Many people I knew voted for me because I had cured their pigs or pets and without the slightest idea what I stood for\".", "In 1929, Leese established his own organization, the Imperial Fascist League (IFL). The movement was initially modelled more along the lines of Italian fascism but, under the influence of Henry Hamilton Beamish, it began to focus on anti-semitism. The IFL and its extensive publishing interests were funded out of Leese's own pocket. In 1932, Oswald Mosley approached Leese with the aim of absorbing the IFL into his own British Union of Fascists. Although relations between the two men were initially cordial (Leese had addressed a New Party meeting on 27 April 1932 on the theme of \"The Blindness of British Politics under the Jew Money-Power\" that was chaired by Mosley),Robert Skidelsky, Oswald Mosley, Macmillan 1975, p. 291 Leese soon attacked Mosley for his failure to deal with the \"Jewish question\", and he eventually labelled Mosley's group \"kosher fascists\"."]}, {"page": "Imperial Fascist League", "response": ["Leese had originally been a member of the British Fascists and indeed had been one of only two members ever to hold elected office for them (as a councillor in Stamford). However, he split from the BF around 1927 and decamped to London, where in 1929, he established both the IFL and its organ The Fascist. The Fascists Legions, a blackshirted paramilitary arm, was soon added under the command of Leslie H. Sherrard. The group initially advocated such policies as corporatism, monetary reform and the removal of citizenship from Jews. It had no more than 500 members and may have had as few as 150. The group was initially led by Brigadier-General Erskine Tulloch although real power lay with Leese, who was confirmed as Director-General in 1932. Henry Hamilton Beamish, the head of The Britons, served as vice-president of the IFL and was a regular speaker at the movement's events."]}]}}
