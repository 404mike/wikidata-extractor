Shortland wanted the film to have \"peril at its heart\" and be \"really emotional but also story-driven\". She took inspiration from films like How to Train Your Dragon (2010), No Country for Old Men (2007), and Thelma & Louise (1991), as well as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Shortland also looked at combat films and ones with armies and militia, allowing her to image females in those roles to help translate that to Black Widow. She referenced fight scenes involving female characters in Alien (1979) and the Terminator franchise, and wanted the film's fights to resemble \"real fights\" rather than wrestling matches. Early reports suggested that Rob Hardy would be the film's cinematographer, but he left the production before filming began. Gabriel Beristain served as cinematographer instead, having previously done so for the Marvel One-Shot short films Item 47 (2012) and Agent Carter (2013) as well as the television series Agent Carter. Beristain was initially not credited in the film's trailers as pointed out by Jeff Sneider of Collider, who wondered if contractual obstacles were to blame for Marvel not crediting the cinematographer at that point. Sneider felt Beristain would be credited in marketing materials leading up to the film's release, and he was confirmed in the role in the film's press advance."]}, {"page": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie", "response": ["| Rob Hardy"]}, {"page": "Ex Machina (film)", "response": ["| Rob Hardy"]}, {"page": "Annihilation (film)", "response": ["Principal photography was underway by April 2016, when actor David Gyasi was added to the cast.
