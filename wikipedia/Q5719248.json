In 1927 he led crews in four flying boats, the Far East Flight, from England around Australia and then up to Hong Kong. His career was cut short by a serious flying accident in January 1939 so until 1945 he was appointed Air Liaison Officer to the Regional Commission for Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cave-Browne-Cave baronets", "response": ["*Sir Rowland Henry Cave-Browne-Cave, 14th Baronet (1865\u20131943), grandson of the 10th Baronet"]}, {"page": "Gerald Livock", "response": ["He was then involved in two long-distance flying boat flights; on 1 July 1926 two Supermarine Southamptons under Livock's command took off from RAF Cattewater, Plymouth, on a flight to Egypt, via Hourtin and Berre in France, then Naples, Valletta, Benghazi and Sollum, arriving at Aboukir on 10 July. From there they flew to Famagusta, Cyprus, via Haifa, and back. On 18 July they left Aboukir, making the return journey via Suda Bay, Corfu and Malta, Italy and France, arriving back at Cattewater on 30 July, having flown . The purpose of the flight was to show that the aircraft were capable of extended operations independent of bases or a parent ship. It also tested the reliability of wireless communications, with both aircraft being in constant communication with land stations for the exchange of location and weather information. On 19 April 1927 Livock was posted to Headquarters, Coastal Area, and on 17 May to the Far East Flight, based at Felixstowe. Livock was sent out to reconnoitre suitable landing places between India and Australia for another long-distance flight, returning to England in September 1927. On 17 October 1927 four Supermarine Southamptons set off from Cattewater. The flight was under the command of Group Captain Henry Cave-Browne-Cave, with Livock as his second-in-command. The aircraft had been fitted with anodized Duralumin hulls and Leitner-Watts steel propellers, rather than the wooden ones of the standard aircraft. They were also fitted with cooking and sleeping facilities inside, and also carried hammocks and awnings for use in tropical climates. They followed the course of the 1926 flight to Egypt, then across Iraq to the Persian Gulf, and followed the northern coast of the Indian Ocean to Karachi, around the coast of India to Ceylon, and around the Bay of Bengal to Burma, and down the Malay Peninsula, finally arriving at Singapore on 28 February. The flight left Singapore on 21 May, flying via Batavia and Surabaya to Kupang in Timor from where on 1 June 1928 they flew to Broome, Western Australia. From there they flew around the coast, accompanied by Wing Commander Lawrence Wackett, RAAF, in his Wackett Widgeon II, to Perth, and then circumnavigated the entire continent via Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Darwin, before arriving back in Singapore on 15 September. An additional flight was then made, calling at Kuching, Manila, and Hong Kong, returning to Singapore via Tourane and Penang. On 1 March 1929 Livock was awarded the Air Force Cross. The flight remained at Singapore, based at RAF Seletar where it became No. 205 (Flying Boat) Squadron, under the command of Cave-Browne-Cave until 1 January 1930, when Livock took over as Officer Commanding."]}, {"page": "Henry Meyrick Cave-Browne-Cave", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Cave-Browne-Cave"]}, {"page": "Cave-Browne-Cave", "response": ["*Henry Cave-Browne-Cave, RAF officer"]}, {"page": "H M Cave-Browne-Cave", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Cave-Browne-Cave"]}, {"page": "H Cave-Browne-Cave", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Cave-Browne-Cave"]}, {"page": "Henry Browne", "response": ["*Henry Cave-Browne-Cave (1887\u20131965), Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force officer"]}, {"page": "List of University of Southampton people", "response": ["* Wing Commander Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-CaveWing Cdr T.
