Plaice created his libretto in Middle English not only adapting the original Chaucer text for an operatic setting, but also drawing on other works by Chaucer and creating entirely original Middle English lyrics. Philips and Plaice structured this adaptation across all four seasons of the calendar year, extending Chaucer's original Tale into Autumn thereby following Januarie's tale on beyond the grave. As the first ever opera in Middle English, the work attracted wide interest.

However, few have ever been translated into English. Only one, Einen Jux will er sich machen, has become well known to English-speaking theatregoers. It has become a classic more than once. It was first adapted as Thornton Wilder's 1938 play The Merchant of Yonkers, which Wilder rewrote in 1954 as The Matchmaker. That version later became the 1964 musical Hello, Dolly! and 1969 film of the same name.
