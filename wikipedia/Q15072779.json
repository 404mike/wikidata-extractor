One of their grandfathers, who had arrived in Britain from Russia aged 16, ran a restaurant in Parfett Street, Whitechapel. Samuel, Mike and Bernie's father, was a boxer and gambler; their mother, Rachel, came from a circus family. In an interview posted on YouTube, a man purporting to be Mike Winters says that Rachel's brothers were champion boxers Jack Bloomfield and Joe Bloomfield.", "On 25 June 1955, Mike and Bernie made their first television appearance. This was on the BBC show Variety Parade, which was a great hit. The brothers stayed with the show until 1958. Their next move, secured by their agent Joe Collins (father of Joan Collins and Jackie Collins), was to the ITV show Sunday Night at the London Palladium, which at the time was the most important variety show on UK television. Due to their popularity they were invited to appear before Queen Elizabeth II at the 1962 Royal Variety Show. In 1963 they starred alongside Frankie Howerd and Tommy Cooper in the Michael Winner film The Cool Mikado.  By 1965, their act was a great success, thanks in part to the shows Big Night Out and its follow-up, Blackpool Night Out. Features of their act were that Mike would appear on stage first, often playing the clarinet. Bernie would then poke his head through a curtain and say \"Eeeeh!\", followed by him pulling Mike's cheeks and calling him \"choochy-face\".The Times Obituary Mike Winters, 27 August, p47 Bernie also had the cheery catchphrase \"I'll smash yer face in\".Daily Telegraph Obituary.
