He made his third first-team appearance in a first round FA Cup match against Notts County, on 3 November. On the following Tuesday, he made his league debut at Fratton Park against Brentford; Pompey lost the League One fixture 1\u20130. On 20 November 2012, first-choice goalkeeper Andersen made his last appearance for Portsmouth in a 2\u20133 defeat to Leyton Orient before returning to Premier League club Reading, making Eastwood the only goalkeeper at Portsmouth, and securing his first-team place. Just after Andersen's departure, former Swindon Town goalkeeper Phil Smith was signed, initially as back-up for Eastwood. Eastwood's position was under threat, when former Portsmouth goalkeeper Alan Knight (famous for the most appearances for a Portsmouth player) came in as goalkeeper coach (after the departure of John Keeley). Knight backed Eastwood, and on 2 March 2013 Pompey won their first match in over four months (23 matches), a 2\u20131 win at Crewe Alexandra, Eastwood's first win as a Portsmouth player. In the next month he kept three clean sheets in six matches, against Bury, Preston North End and Tranmere Rovers.

This didn't go unnoticed as City boss Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson saw fit to extend Martin's contract to the end of the season.

He had a trial with Aston Villa, but Ron Saunders decided against signing him due to Villa having recently taken on an apprentice goalkeeper. BBC Essex sports presenter Roger Buxton, recommended Delf to Southend United chief scout Bob Walls, eventually signing on non-contract terms in 1983. He made a number of reserve team appearances before making his debut on 26 March 1983 in the Football League Third Division for Southend against Sheffield United, in the 3\u20131 home victory.

With youth team product Nathan Munson on the books, McDonough brought in John Keeley from Oldham Athletic in the summer. However, his performances did not convince and he played his final game for the club in November 1993. This meant a string of mid-season transfers and loans of goalkeepers into the club, and the U's ended the season having once again used six different goalkeepers. McDonough even found himself in goal in October 1993 when facing Hereford United after Keeley and substitute Munson were both sent off for professional fouls. The U's went on to lose that game 5\u20130. Colchester were the first Football League club to have two goalkeepers sent off in the same fixture. Hereford striker Chris Pike scored a hat-trick in the game, with each of his goals coming against three different goalkeepers.", "|John Keeley", "|John Keeley", "|align=\"left\"|John Keeley", "|align=\"left\"|John Keeley", "|John Keeley"]}]}}
