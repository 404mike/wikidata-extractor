The year also saw the death of Opposition Leader Mick O'Halloran and his replacement by Frank Walsh. Dunstan attempted to win the position of Opposition Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor caucus was sceptical of his age and inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, albeit narrowly.Dunstan, p. 74.Crocker, p. 121."]}, {"page": "Frank Walsh", "response": [" When longtime Opposition Leader Robert Richards retired in 1949, his deputy, Mick O'Halloran, ascended as leader. Walsh was elected as his deputy when it became clear no one else wanted the job.  Labor had by then been in opposition in South Australia since 1933. The LCL, led by Sir Thomas Playford, ruled South Australia through a time of strong economic development and held power thanks to an electoral malapportionment known as the Playmander, in which rural areas were significantly overrepresented in the legislature. By this time, many South Australian Labor politicians had despaired of ever winning power, and considered the Deputy Opposition Leader's post to be a thankless, low-paying job."]}, {"page": "1960 in Australia", "response": ["* 2 September \u2013 Mick O'Halloran (born 1893), politician"]}, {"page": "Michael O'Halloran", "response": ["* Mick O'Halloran (1893\u20131960), Australian Labor Party (ALP) politician"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Frome", "response": ["The second incarnation began in 1938 after the introduction of the Playmander.  It was based on the area north of Port Pirie, and was originally a Labor stronghold. The seat was won by Mick O'Halloran, who held it until his death in 1960, serving as Opposition Leader from 1949 to 1960. After the Playmander was significantly diluted by the 1970 electoral reforms, Frome was moved into more conservative-leaning rural areas around Port Pirie, turning it into a notional Liberal and Country League (LCL) seat.  O'Halloran's successor, Tom Casey, believed this made Frome impossible to hold and successfully transferred to the Legislative Council.  The LCL, which later became the South Australia division of the Liberal Party, won the seat at the 1970 state election, and went on to hold Frome until the abolition of the seat in 1977.", "| Mick O'Halloran "]}, {"page": "Playmander", "response": ["The electoral system contributed to Playford achieving a then-world record for a democratically elected leader; he spent 27 years as Premier of South Australia.  During this period, as a result of population changes, the rural overweighting allowed Playford to hold onto power even when the LCL lost by decisive margins in actual votes.  In 1944 and 1953, for instance, Labor won 53 percent of the two-party vote to the LCL's 47 percent.  In most other parts of Australia with fairer electoral systems, this would have been enough to give the Labor leader--Robert Richards in 1944 and Mick O'Halloran in 1953\u2014a solid majority government. However, due to the Playmander, the LCL was still able to eke out a paper-thin majority in both elections.  Rural areas, excepting industrial towns such as Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Pirie, were likely to support the LCL.  The Adelaide area was overwhelmingly Labor; even at the height of Playford's popularity, the LCL only had a realistic chance of winning seats in the wealthy \"eastern crescent\" and around Holdfast Bay."]}, {"page": "Thomas Playford IV", "response": ["In office, Playford turned his back on laissez faire economics and used his negotiating skills to encourage industry to relocate to South Australia during World War II, as the state was far from the battlefield. He built upon this in the post-war boom years, particular in automotive manufacturing; although a liberal conservative, his approach to economics was pragmatic, and he was derided by his colleagues for his \"socialism\" as he nationalised electricity companies and used state enterprises to drive economic growth. Generally, Playford had more dissent from within his own party than the opposition centre-left Labor Party; the main obstructions to his initiatives came from the upper house, where the restriction of suffrage to landowners resulted in a chamber dominated by the conservative landed gentry. Labor leader Mick O'Halloran worked cooperatively with Playford and was known to be happy being out of power, quipping that Playford could better serve his left-wing constituents. Playford's policies allowed for the supply of cheap electricity to factories, minimal business taxes, and low wages to make the state more attractive to industrial investment. He kept salaries low by using the South Australian Housing Trust to build public housing and government price controls to attract workers and migrants, angering the landlord class. Implemented in the 1940s, these policies were seen as dangerous to Playford's control of his party, but they proved successful and he cemented his position within the LCL.", "Many of the methods that Playford used were described by economic conservatives as 'socialism', drawing opposition from within his own party, especially in the Legislative Council. It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber\u2014Sir Collier Cudmore\u2014once referred to Playford as a 'Bolshevik'.Howell, p. 66. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader Mick O'Halloran would dine with Playford on a weekly basis to discuss the development of the state, and the pair were on close personal terms. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that \"I wouldn't want to be Premier even if I could be. Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters than I could if I were in his shoes.\"Cockburn, p. 218. O'Halloran's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon, but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display.Howell, p. 67. As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor, O'Halloran was often described as the premier's 'junior partner\".Blewett and Jaensch, p. 14. Playford called Labor \"our Opposition\", in comparison to opponents in his party, which he decried as being \"critical without being helpful\". This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until Don Dunstan's prominence in the late 1950s,Howell, pp. 65\u201368. when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.Hugo, pp. 41, 45."]}, {"page": "O'Halloran", "response": ["*Mick O'Halloran (1893\u20131960), South Australian politician"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1959\u20131962", "response": ["|| Mick O'Halloran  || Labor || Frome || 1918\u20131921, 1924\u20131927, 1938\u20131960", ": The Labor member for Frome and Opposition Leader Mick O'Halloran died on 22 September 1960.
