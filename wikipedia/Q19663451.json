The first four writers published were Tyler Keevil, Will Gritten, J. P. Smythe and Susie Wild. A poetry anthology, 10 of the Best, followed in 2011, featuring ten poems each from Mab Jones, Alan Kellermann, Anna Lewis, M. A. Oliver-Semenov and Si\u00f4n Tomos Owen. Full poetry collections from Kellermann and Lewis were published under the Bright Young Things banner in 2012, though the series marketing was less prominent. Collections from Oliver-Semenov and Owen were published by Parthian in 2016, but by this point the Bright Young Things series had been seemingly abandoned."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women writers", "response": ["*Susie Wild (born 1979), novelist, journalist and editor"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Susie Wild (born 1979), novelist, journalist, editor, strong connections with Wales"]}]}}
