He has been described as \"one of the best known academic Marxists of his generation\", in this manner being compared with E. P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm and Perry Anderson.Miliband was born in Belgium to working-class Polish Jewish immigrants. He fled to Britain in 1940 with his father, to avoid persecution when Nazi Germany invaded Belgium. Learning to speak English and enrolling at the London School of Economics, he became involved in left-wing politics and made a personal commitment to the cause of socialism at the grave of Karl Marx. After serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, he settled in London in 1946 and naturalised as a British subject in 1948.\nBy the 1960s, he was a prominent member of the New Left movement in Britain, which was critical of established socialist governments in the Soviet Union and Central Europe (the Eastern Bloc). He published several books on Marxist theory and the criticism of capitalism, such as Parliamentary Socialism (1961), The State in Capitalist Society (1969), and Marxism and Politics (1977).\nBoth of his sons, David and Ed Miliband, went on to become senior members of the Labour Party following their father's death. David was the British Foreign Secretary from 2007 to 2010, whilst Ed became Energy and Climate Change Secretary and was later elected party leader, serving between 2010 and 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Noam Chomsky", "response": ["*(facsimile copy of Lukes's THES article, together with some of the correspondence it provoked, including from Ralph Miliband, Ken Coates and others, with Chomsky's response)"]}, {"page": "State (polity)", "response": ["For Marxist theorists, the role of the modern bourgeois state is determined by its function in the global capitalist order. Ralph Miliband argued that the ruling class uses the state as its instrument to dominate society by virtue of the interpersonal ties between state officials and economic elites. For Miliband, the state is dominated by an elite that comes from the same background as the capitalist class. State officials therefore share the same interests as owners of capital and are linked to them through a wide array of social, economic, and political ties."]}, {"page": "London School of Economics", "response": ["There are also a number of annual lecture series hosted by various departments.

Ralph Miliband had arrived in the UK from Belgium as a Jewish refugee from the Holocaust.

In the editorial, the paper further remarked that \"We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons. But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father's teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different.\" A spokesman for the paper also described claims that the article continued its history of anti-Semitism as \"absolutely spurious.\" However, the reference to \"the jealous God of Deuteronomy\" was criticised by Jonathan Freedland, who said that \"In the context of a piece about a foreign-born Jew, [the remark] felt like a subtle, if not subterranean hint to the reader, a reminder of the ineradicable alienness of this biblically vengeful people\" and that \"those ready to acquit the Mail because there was no bald, outright statement of antisemitism were probably using the wrong measure.\""]}, {"page": "List of sociologists", "response": ["* Ralph Miliband, British sociologist"]}, {"page": "Political sociology", "response": ["English Marxist sociologist Ralph Miliband was influenced by American sociologist C.
