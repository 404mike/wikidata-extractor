He also entered politics and became a Member of Parliament.\nBastard was born into a family with considerable political connections, and was a grandson of the distinguished Royal Navy officer Captain Philemon Pownoll (d.1780), the builder of Sharpham House. He entered the navy and rose through the ranks during the wars with France. He was promoted to commander and given his first ship while in the East Indies, and was able to show his qualities by chasing a larger French privateer until she was captured by a larger British ship. Promoted to post-captain soon afterwards, one of his first post commands was the former privateer he had helped to capture. He was moved to the North American station shortly before the outbreak of the War of 1812 and commanded the station's flagship while serving in a detached squadron. Events that Bastard took part in included the capture of USS Nautilus and the chase of USS Constitution. His ship was sent home in 1814 and he commanded only one other ship before the drawdown of the navy after the end of the wars. He then entered politics, sitting for Dartmouth until 1832.", "link_mentions": {}}}
