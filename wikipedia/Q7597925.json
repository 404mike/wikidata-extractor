The fans were already showing their disappointment in the team twenty minutes before the end of the first home game \u2013 a 2\u20131 defeat to Colchester United. Ken Hancock and Jackie Mudie were both dropped following this game. Richards made his return only to suffer a knee injury which required surgery, thereby keeping him out of action for the rest of the campaign. On 5 September Billy Bingham had played his last game, as he broke his leg in a 4\u20130 beating by Brentford at Griffin Park. Two successive mid-September 1\u20130 victories (both goals scored by Albert Cheesebrough) were rare bright rays of sunshine for the \"Valiants\". A 'punchless' and 'guileless' run of twelve games without a win followed, which saw the club drop to third from bottom, as attendances tailed off accordingly. Cheeseborough also picked up an injury, whilst Mudie found he was now unable to play on hard surfaces. Reserves filled the gaps in the first eleven as at Vale Park 'the loud mouths on the terraces certainly did a good job [of] hindering Stan Trafford' on his home debut on 17 October. Goals in short-supply, numerous players were tried in the centre-forward role, to no avail.", "On the financial side, a \u00a315,497 was recorded despite a donation of \u00a316,320 from the Sportsmen's Association, the Development Fund, and the social club.
