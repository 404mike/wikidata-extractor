With many players moving on, the new management team had to rebuild the side from scratch, but an encouraging second half of the season saw the Glassboys finish a creditable 9th.  The following season saw a memorable run in the FA Vase, culminating in a quarter-final defeat at A.F.C. Sudbury in the quarter-final before finally succumbing to a 4\u20131 defeat after extra time.  In May 2005 Hackett took sole charge of the team after Ford decided to step down due to work and family commitments.  With the likely re-organisation of the non-league pyramid at Step 4 level, the club looked to mount a strong push for promotion, however a mixed start to the campaign left Stourbridge lying in mid-table by December.  After a poor start, a run of 14 league games unbeaten was enough to clinch a runners-up spot and with it promotion back to the Southern League.  Victories over Burton Albion and Moor Green also saw the team reach the Birmingham Senior Cup Final for the first time in 30 years, although they succumbed to a 1\u20130 defeat to Willenhall Town."]}, {"page": "Hackett (surname)", "response": ["* Gary Hackett, former English footballer"]}, {"page": "Ashley Vincent", "response": ["Vincent signed for National League North side Worcester City in August 2015 following a successful trial spell.
