She began working at Loughborough University in 1992. Her subsequent work focused on the socialist thought of William Morris (1834\u20131896).

Freeden, Michael; Stears, Marc (eds.). \"Anarchism\". The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies. Oxford University Press: 385\u2013404. . \"[M]any, questionably, regard anti-statism as the irremovable, universal principle at the core of anarchism. [...] The fact that [anarchists and anarcho-capitalists] share a core concept of 'anti-statism', which is often advanced as [...] a commonality between them [...], is insufficient to produce a shared identity [...] because [they interpret] the concept of state-rejection [...] differently despite the initial similarity in nomenclature\" (pp. 386\u2013388). Austrian school economist David Prychitko, in the context of anarcho-capitalism says that \"while society without a state is necessary for full-fledged anarchy, it is nevertheless insufficient\". According to Ruth Kinna, anarcho-capitalists are anti-statists who draw more on right-wing liberal theory and the Austrian School than anarchist traditions. Kinna writes that \"[i]n order to highlight the clear distinction between the two positions\", anarchists describe anarcho-capitalists as \"propertarians\".Kinna, Ruth, ed. (2012).

According to Kinna, anarcho-capitalists \"will sometimes label themselves market anarchists because they recognize the negative connotations of 'capitalism'. But the literature of anarcho-capitalism draws on classical liberal theory, particularly the Austrian School \u2013 Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises \u2013 rather than recognizable anarchist traditions.

Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labor as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labor and was required for labor and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property.\" For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land."]}, {"page": "Anarchist Studies", "response": ["Anarchist Studies is a biannual academic journal on anarchism.
