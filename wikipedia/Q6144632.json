James was a natural gardener and he helped his father on the Killerton estate from a very early age. When Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet resurrected the landscaping projects at Killerton, James introduced many of his own ideas and working methods, and some of the mature Spanish chestnuts and beech trees on the estate are a testament to this work.\nThe Budlake nursery continued to flourish, and in 1832 with James now at the helm, the nursery was expanded with the purchase of 25 acres (100,000 m2) of land at Mount Radford on the Topsham Road, Exeter. This was followed by the first of a number of shops or seed warehouses in the city centre area, with the first at 54 High Street and the last at the site of the Well House Inn in Cathedral Yard. \nBy 1837 James Junior, the eldest of six children, had begun working at the nursery following training at several London-based nurseries. The family had by now moved into their specially-commissioned villa, Gras Lawn, close to the Mount Radford nursery. The multi-stemmed Sequoiadendron giganteum which graced the front garden of the Veitch residence can still be seen today as it towers above a new development off Barrack Road.\nIn 1839 James Veitch Snr extended the nurseries still further by renting 30 acres (120,000 m2) of land at Poltimore known as the \"Bramberries\". This site was predominantly an overspill for Haldon and Brockhill (near Broadclyst Heath).\nBy now, James Junior had established the family business in Kings Road, Chelsea. In Exeter, James senior was succeeded by his younger son, Robert, and this branch became Robert Veitch & Sons.\nThe two nurseries operated together for ten years until the death of James Snr in May 1863.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Robinson (gardener)", "response": ["In 1866, at the age of 29, he became a fellow of the Linnean Society under the sponsorship of Charles Darwin, James Veitch, David Moore, and seven other distinguished botanists and horticulturists.

Amongst the plants that he discovered on this expedition and introduced to European hot-houses were Aphelandra nitens and Sanchezia nobilis. From Argentina, he collected Nierembergia rivularis and N. veitchii, Palava flexuosa, Mutisia decurrens and several varieties of Peperomia. On his return to La Paz, in November 1865 he also sent back to England a number of Hippeastrums, including H. pardinum and H. leopoldii and some samples of Eccremocarpus which were subsequently lost.", "On returning from La Paz in 1866, Pearce's contract with James Veitch & Sons was terminated and he returned to his home at Plymouth, where he married."]}, {"page": "William Lobb", "response": ["By the late 1830s, James Veitch had established his plant nursery at Mount Radford, Exeter and was looking for ways to extend the range of plants on offer, thus improving the profitability of the business. After correspondence with the eminent botanist Sir William Hooker about the most suitable destination, Veitch decided to employ his own plant hunter to gather exotic plants from South America exclusively for his nursery. William's brother Thomas had been employed by Veitch since 1830 and recommended William to Veitch. Veitch was impressed by William's keen manner and horticultural knowledge; according to the account in Hortus Veitchii, William:was quick of observation, ready in resources, and practical in their application; he had devoted much of his leisure to the study of botany, in which considerable proficiency had been acquired.", "Veitch decided that William, despite not being a trained botanist, would prove a steady, industrious and dependable collector. He therefore booked him a passage on HM Packet Seagull, which was to set sail from Falmouth on 7 November 1840, bound for Rio de Janeiro and Lobb thus became the first of a long line of plant collectors to be sent out by the Veitch family to all corners of the world. James Veitch was anxious to ensure that Lobb should not be \"cramped for funds\" and arranged for an annual allowance of \u00a3400 to be made available to draw on in the large cities along his planned itinerary.", "James Veitch's instructions to Lobb included a request to locate and bring back seeds of the Chile pine (more popularly known as the monkey-puzzle tree) (Araucaria araucana) which had originally been introduced to Britain by Archibald Menzies in 1795. Veitch had seen a young specimen at Kew Gardens grown from seed brought back by the Horticultural Society's collector James McRae in 1826, and was convinced that this tree would be hugely popular as an ornamental plant.", "He eventually reached the port of Tumaco, with a further collection of plants, from where he sailed for Panama intending to travel on with his latest finds back to England. On arriving at Panama City however, he received news from James Veitch that the cases of plants left in Guayaquil had never arrived. Lobb therefore despatched his latest collection from Panama (which arrived safely at Exeter) and awaited instructions from Veitch.", "Lobb's finds were despatched to England where they were grown in Veitch's Exeter nursery before being sold to eager gardeners. Many of his discoveries have endured and remain popular garden shrubs today. One glasshouse at the Exeter nursery was reserved exclusively for William Lobb's discoveries, where James Veitch would tend the new plants and identify those that would become a commercial success and those that would be merely of botanical interest. Amongst the plants sent back by Lobb were two species of Cantua which he found growing in Bolivia, Chile and the Peruvian Andes; C. buxifolia (the magic-flower) which was the first to flower in May 1848 and the bushy C. bicolor, with its large golden-red trumpet flowers.", "On Christmas Eve 1853, an editorial in The Gardeners' Chronicle announced that Veitch & Son \"had received branches and cones of a remarkable tree from their collector in California, William Lobb\" who had described it as \"the monarch of the Californian forest\". James Veitch had immediately given specimens of the giant tree to John Lindley, professor of botany at the University of London and invited him to name the tree. In the Gardeners' Chronicle article, Lindley named the species Wellingtonia gigantea as a memorial to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington who had died in September the previous year. The \"giant amongst trees\" was considered an appropriate memorial for such an important British historical figure.", "By the middle of 1854, James Veitch and his son, James Veitch, Jr. (who had acquired premises in Kings Road, Chelsea, London in 1853), decided that it was time for William and his brother, Thomas, to be sent off again to collect fresh seed and search for yet more new plants. Thomas was sent back to the far East, to Java and North Borneo in search of Nepenthes pitcher plants.", "William had been suffering from persistent ill-health for some time \u2013 James Veitch remarked that there was \"a sort of restlessness about him\" \u2013 and was exhibiting the symptoms of syphilis, probably contracted in the ports of South America. In a letter to Sir William Hooker, James Veitch noticed:He seems taken with a sort of monomania, which it is difficult to describe and which he could not explain himself, a sort of excitability and want of confidence. Despite his concerns, in the autumn of 1854, Veitch sent Lobb back to California on another three\u2013year contract. Lobb was unable to make any further new discoveries, but sent back consignments of plants and seeds from time to time until the end of 1856. In January 1857, Veitch wrote to Hooker: \"We hear Lobb has been ill, his writing appears shaky and I am inclined to think it is probable he will soon return.\"", "In the event, Lobb did not return to England and after the expiry of his contract in 1858 he remained in California. He sent back a small number of seeds to private collectors and to the Low nursery at Clapton, including a new variety of white fir (Abies concolor subsp. lowiana) (popularly known as \"Low's white fir\" after them) and the rare Torrey pine (Pinus torreyana). James Veitch complained to Lobb that he still had obligations to fulfill but Lobb was undeterred and caused Veitch further embarrassment by sending herbarium specimens and live plants direct to Sir William Hooker at Kew Gardens."]}, {"page": "James Veitch", "response": ["James Veitch may refer to:", "* James Veitch, Lord Elliock (1712\u20131793), Scottish advocate, judge, politician and landowner", "* James Veitch (comedian), British comedian, director, writer and producer ", "* James Veitch (horticulturist) (1792\u20131863), English horticulturist", "* James Veitch Jr. (1815\u20131869), English horticulturist", "* James Veitch (minister) (1808-1879) minister of the Church of Scotland, astronomer and geologist"]}, {"page": "Lupton, Brixham", "response": ["It seems that two famous designers were involved in the laying out of Lupton Gardens in 1840, namely James Veitch and George Wightwick.

His ancestor Lord Edward Seymour (died 1593) had acquired the feudal barony of Berry Pomeroy, the caput of which was Berry Pomeroy Castle, also in south Devon. In around 1830 a large porte-cochere of Portland stone was added to the south face of Stover House; it contains under a classical portico of Doric columns a curved double flight of balustraded stairs. The grand entrance gate to the estate has Doric columns and was probably built at the same time as the porte-cochere, to which it is similar in style. Today it is unused and is situated on the side of the busy A38 main road. Another major addition of around 1830 was the \"Clock House\", a large neoclassical stable block built around a quadrangle to the west of the main house: it replaced the Templer stables to the north. Before 1834 St Maur had consulted with James Veitch about making improvements to the grounds. In the garden today are a small classical temple and a grotto. The principal seat of the Seymour family had been Maiden Bradley in Wiltshire, but it now became Stover,Masters, p.50 and here the Duke housed his valuable \"Hamilton\" art collection that had been brought to the family by his wife Lady Charlotte Hamilton, a daughter of the 9th Duke of Hamilton, as her marriage portion.
