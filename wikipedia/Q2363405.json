She modelled for painter Lucian Freud.\nBorn in south London, Tilley worked for performance artist and club promoter Leigh Bowery as a cashier at his \"Taboo\" night club. Bowery introduced her to Lucian Freud in 1990 and she began posing for him the following year. During this time, she was also a full-time benefits supervisor at the Charing Cross jobcentre, a state-operated employment agency, and she eventually became manager there.Freud painted several large nude portraits of Tilley, the first being Evening in the Studio (1993). Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, painted in 1995, was sold at auction in 2008 for \u00a317 million ($33.6 million US) in New York City. In 2015, the 1994 painting Benefits Supervisor Resting sold for \u00a335 million ($56 million US). A fourth painting Sleeping by the Lion Carpet was painted in 1996. Freud also produced a number of etchings featuring Tilley, including Woman with an Arm Tattoo which Tilley sold in 2005.In 1997, she published Leigh Bowery: The life and times of an Icon, a biography.From September 2000 to March 2001, Chief Curator Rolf Lauter at Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst Frankfurt could realise the only overview exhibition of Freud's works in a German museum in close cooperation with the artist. Both the catalog and the invitation as well as the poster included Freud's painting Sleeping by the Lion Carpet from 1995/96 with Sue Tilley.\nIn 2015, she had a solo show of paintings and drawings in a London gallery. She did a collaboration with Fendi to decorate luxury clothes and bags with her pictures of desk lamps, bottle openers, banana skins, cups of coffee.In September 2021 Tilley was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 show Saturday Live.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lucian Freud", "response": ["Freud painted fellow artists, including Frank Auerbach and Francis Bacon and produced a large number of portraits of the performance artist Leigh Bowery.

All print media bore the motif of Freud's outstanding painting Sleeping by the Lion Carpet (1995-1996) depicting the nude Sue Tilley. In addition to some of his most important nude portraits of women, the large-format picture Nude with leg up (Leigh Bowery) from 1992 was also shown in Frankfurt, which was removed in the Metropolitan Museum New York from the exhibition in 1993.Lauter, Rolf (ed.): Lucian Freud: Naked Portraits.

The Frankfurt exhibition was realised in a personal dialogue between curator Rolf Lauter and Lucian Freud and is thus the only project Freud authorised in direct cooperation with a German museum.In 1987 the British Council organised a retrospective for the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, which was subsequently shown in the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne in Paris, in the Hayward Gallery London and in the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. The major retrospective at London's Hayward Gallery in 1988 was the focal point for the BBC Omnibus programme which saw one of the very few conversations with Freud ever recorded, in this case with Omnibus director Jake Auerbach. The conversations with the artist were made possible by Duncan MacGuigan from Acquavella Galleries New York. This was followed by a large retrospective at Tate Britain in 2002. In 2001, Freud completed a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. There was criticism of the portrayal in some sections of the British media.\"Freud royal portrait divides critics\".
