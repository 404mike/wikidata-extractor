Born in Croydon, Surrey, he is best remembered for the twelve Flaxborough novels, typified by their comic and dry wit and set in a fictional small town in England which is closely based on Boston, Lincolnshire.  He worked as a journalist in Lincolnshire and the characters in his books are said to be highly recognisable caricatures of people he encountered in his work. He was twice married.\nHis 1971 study of interwar thrillers 'Snobbery With Violence', made the phrase popular for describing such authors as Dornford Yates.\nWatson was the first person to successfully sue Private Eye for libel, for an article in issue 25 when he objected to being described as: \u201cthe little-known author who . . . was writing a novel, very Wodehouse but without the jokes\u201d. He was awarded \u00a3750. He died in Folkingham, Lincolnshire in 1983.", "link_mentions": {}}}
