Born in Croydon, Surrey, he is best remembered for the twelve Flaxborough novels, typified by their comic and dry wit and set in a fictional small town in England which is closely based on Boston, Lincolnshire.  He worked as a journalist in Lincolnshire and the characters in his books are said to be highly recognisable caricatures of people he encountered in his work. He was twice married.\nHis 1971 study of interwar thrillers, Snobbery With Violence, made the phrase popular for describing such authors as Dornford Yates.\nWatson was the first person to successfully sue Private Eye for libel, for an article in issue 25 when he objected to being described as: \u201cthe little-known author who . . . was writing a novel, very Wodehouse but without the jokes\u201d. He was awarded \u00a3750. He died in Folkingham, Lincolnshire in 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boston, Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Boston is often assumed to be the prototype for Flaxborough, in the detective novels of Colin Watson."]}, {"page": "Spalding, Lincolnshire", "response": ["* 1977 - Location filming for episodes of BBC TV series Murder Most English, starring Anton Rodgers, based on novels by Lincolnshire author Colin Watson.

Hornung", "response": ["Much of Hornung's work fell out of favour as time passed; Rowland observed that \"all of Hornung's other works have been forgotten, with the possible exception of Stingaree, but the cricketing Cracksman continues to enthral\". The idea of a criminal as a positive character was one of Hornung's legacies, and Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism states that \"critics have also interpreted Raffles as a prototype of the antihero in modern crime fiction\". The academic Frank Wadleigh Chandler, describing Raffles's death, writes that \"all his creator's attempts to portray him as a hero, rather than an anti-hero, deservedly fail.\" Valentine highlights one aspect of the stories was the mix of \"devilry and daring\" demonstrated by Raffles; in this respect he was a literary \"forerunner of The Saint, James Bond and other insouciant types\". The writer Colin Watson agrees, and called Hornung \"a precursor of [Ian] Fleming\".", "Hornung's prose is widely admired for its lucid, simple style. Oliver Edwards, writing in The Times, considered that \"not the least attractive part of the Raffles books is the simple, plain, unaffected language in which each one of them is written\". The obituarist in the same newspaper agrees, and thinks Hornung had \"a power of good and clear description and a talent for mystery and surprise\". Colin Watson also considers the point, and observes that in Hornung's writing, \"superfluous description has been avoided and account of action is to the point\", while Doyle admired his \"sudden use of the right adjective and the right phrase\", something the writer and journalist Jeremy Lewis sees as a \"flamboyant, Kiplingesque taste for the vivid\"."]}, {"page": "Sydney Horler", "response": ["Literary reviewers of the time, such Dorothy L.
