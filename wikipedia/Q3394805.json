Although this failed, Smuts had proved his point: that he would stop at nothing to defeat his enemies. Norman Kemp Smith wrote that General Smuts read from Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason on the evening before the raid. Smith contended that this showed how Kant's critique can be a solace and a refuge, as well as a means to sharpen the wit. Combined with the British failure to pacify the Transvaal, Smuts' success left the United Kingdom with no choice but to offer a ceasefire and a peace conference, to be held at Vereeniging."]}, {"page": "Critique of Pure Reason", "response": ["Note: The A and B designations refer to the page numbers of the first (1781) and second (1787) German editions, respectively.

Experience, Kant had claimed, is always spatio-temporal. Inner sense, however, may be exclusively temporal. Kemp Smith then guessed, in opposition to his earlier statement, why Kant ignored space as a transcendental schema. \"Possibly Kant\u2019s very natural preoccupation with his new revolutionary doctrine of inner sense and productive imagination has something to do with the matter [i.e., is the reason for his elimination of space].\"Norman Kemp Smith, A Commentary to Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason, New York: Macmillan, 1918, p. 341 Thus, Kant's doctrine of inner sense and its emphasis on time resulted in his exclusion of space as a transcendental schema.", "Kant introduced the concept of the transcendental schema in his chapter entitled \"Of the Schematism of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding.\" It is considered to be one of Kant's more difficult chapters. Even though he knew that he was not writing for a popular readership, Kant twice tried to apologize for this chapter by calling it \"very dry\"Prolegomena to any future metaphysics, \u00a7 34 and \"dry and tedious.\" Kant entered into his 1797 notebook: \"In general, the schematism is one of the most difficult points. \u2013 Even Herr Beck cannot find his way about in it.\"Kant, Notes and Fragments, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 394, 18:686 Professor W.H. Walsh, of the University of Edinburgh, wrote: \"The chapter on Schematism probably presents more difficulties to the uncommitted but sympathetic reader than any other part of the Critique of Pure Reason. Not only are the details of the argument highly obscure (that, after all, is a common enough experience in reading Kant, though one is not often so baffled as one is here): it is hard to say in plain terms what general point or points Kant is seeking to establish.\"Walsh, W.H., \"Schematism,\" Kant\u2013Studien, Band 49 (1957), K\u00f6lner Universit\u00e4ts\u2013Verlag Arthur Schopenhauer referred to it as \"\u2026the strange 'Chapter on the Schematism of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding,' which is well known for its great obscurity, since no one has ever been able to make anything out of it.\"Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. I, Appendix, \"Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy\", Courier Dover Publications, 2012, p. 450 Schopenhauer's notebooks contained entries that described Kant's chapter on schemata as \"an audacious piece of nonsense\"\"\u2026from the chapter on the schematism of the pure concepts of the understanding (a chapter which, in spite of all our respect for Kant, we must call an audacious piece of nonsense) it is very clear that these categories not only contribute nothing towards intuitive perception, but are very far removed from this, since there are still to be found between them and intuitive perception these quite peculiar absurdities, the schemata.\" Schopenhauer, Manuscript Remains, Vol. 2, \"Against Kant,\" p. 466. and the schema as \"an absurdity whose non\u2013existence is plain.\"\"There is \u2026 inserted between the categories and intuitive perception the schema, an absurdity whose non\u2013existence is plain to anyone in his senses\u2026.\" Schopenhauer, Manuscript Remains, Vol. 2, \"Against Kant,\" p. 472. Schopenhauer also remarked on \"...the futility of such intermediate things between intuitive perception and concepts.\"Schopenhauer, Manuscript Remains, Vol. 2, \"Against Kant,\" pp. 466-7. In Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata, he attempted to clear up the obscurity by attributing Kant's concept of schemata simply to a psychological need for architectonic symmetry in his writings.  Empirical concepts are based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) also have a basis. But this contradicts his previous assertion that pure concepts simply exist in the human mind and are not based on pure, schematic perceptions. Schopenhauer also alleged that schemata were introduced merely to give plausibility to Kant's description of the categories or pure concepts of the understanding. The article on Kant in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls Kant's schematism a \"baffling doctrine \" with \"cryptic sentences.\" Josiah Royce referred to \"the perplexing doctrine of the Schema.\"Lectures on Modern Idealism, Lecture II, p. 57 The Scottish philosopher Robert Adamson wrote: \"Kant's manner of explaining the functions of schematism is extremely apt to be misunderstood, and to mislead.\"Robert Adamson, On the Philosophy of Kant, p. 53 f. Kant's early critics (1782 \u20131789) did not discuss schematism because they couldn't follow Kant's explanation.\"It was not clear what the link was between categories and intuitions and how empty forms of the understanding could be applied to sensations. Kant was aware of this problem and tried to address it through the doctrine of the schematism, but his contemporaries were not able to follow him here. Indeed, the doctrine of the schematism was left largely out of consideration by Kant's critics.\" Kant's Early Critics, Edited by Brigitte Sassen, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 30.

Press, Bloomington, 1962, \u00a7 22. \"The Transcendental Schematism,\" Page 111 After more than two centuries, Kant's explanation of schema still seems to be unclear to many readers. In their book on parallel distributed processing, the PDP Research Group discussed Kant's schemata when they appropriated that word to designate their concept of  image schemata. \"The schema,\" they wrote, \"throughout history, has been a concept shrouded in mystery. Kant's \u2026 use of the term has been provocative but difficult to understand.\"McClelland, J.L., et al., Parallel Distributed Processing, Vol. 2, p. 17 After this sentence, no further attempt was made to discuss Kant's term and the concept that it designates. H. H. Price, in Thinking and Experience, page 292, referred to Kant's Schema and wrote, \"\u2026I must confess I do not fully understand it.\" In 2004, Professor Georges Dicker of SUNY Brockport stated: \"I find the Schematism especially opaque\u2026.\"Kant\u2019s Theory of Knowledge: An Analytical Introduction, Georges Dicker, Oxford University Press, \"Preface,\" p. viii. Kant scholar Norman Kemp Smith judged A Commentary to Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason (London: Macmillan, 1918), p. 334. the schematism chapter to be a \"highly artificial argument.\" Kant's explanation seems, to Kemp Smith, to be contrived and to have no natural progression.

Saaty and Fritz Joachim Weyl, \"Insight and Reflection,\" p. 283, New York:McGraw-Hill, 1969. In his English lectures, published in 1796, Kant's pupil Friedrich August Nitsch warned his listeners and readers against the difficulty in comprehending Kant's concept of the schema.
