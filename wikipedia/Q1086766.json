The report alleges that U.S Vice President Dick Cheney discussed the activity of the group against Iran during his visit to Pakistan. In a blog, the network stated that the support was believed to have started in 2005 and been arranged so that the U.S provided no direct funding to the group, which would require congressional oversight and attract media attention, drawing parallels between American support for Jundallah and U.S. involvement in Nicaragua."]}, {"page": "Steve Vickers (computer scientist)", "response": ["Steve Vickers (born c. 1953)Vickers's age was given as 29 in a Sinclair User article from July 1982. , accessed 5 October 2013. is a British mathematician and computer scientist.

The latter was produced by Jupiter Cantab, a short-lived company Vickers formed together with Richard Altwasser, after the two had left Sinclair Research. Since the late 1980s, Vickers has been an academic in the field of geometric logic, writing over 30 papers in scholarly journals on mathematical aspects of computer science.
