The club, however, took little interest in him as a youngster and, at nine-years-old, he joined Bristol Rovers after being spotted by former professional Stan Montgomery, who was working for Rovers. Although an hour's drive from his family home, Bellamy was swayed by the better coaching and his own playing kit. He spent two years with Bristol Rovers before being spotted by a scout working for Norwich City. The club invited Bellamy to a trial match in Somerset where he impressed and was asked to travel with the side to compete in the Dana Cup, an international youth football tournament held in Hj\u00f8rring, Denmark. His performances led to a permanent place with the Canary Rangers, Norwich's youth development side. Prior to signing with the club, several other teams took an interest in Bellamy; Leeds United offered his parents \u00a310,000 if he signed for them. Norwich responded by guaranteeing him a two-year YTS contract when he was old enough to sign. Bellamy travelled to Norwich by train on Saturday afternoons, then played a youth match on Sunday morning before returning to Cardiff."]}, {"page": "Frank Dudley (footballer)", "response": ["When the Football League returned following the end of World War II, Dudley made his professional debut in a match against Watford and became a first-team regular at Southend Stadium. He quickly attracted attention from several sides, including Cardiff City who had considered signing Dudley when they completed the signing of his teammate Stan Montgomery in 1948. He eventually joined Leeds United in August 1949 in a player swap deal that saw Albert Wakefield move in the opposite direction. The transfer saw Dudley's weekly wage rise from seven pound per week to twelve pound and, after making his debut for the club against West Ham United on 22 August 1949, he finished his first season with the Yorkshire club as their top goalscorer, scoring 16 times in all competitions, including four goals during their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals. The following season, Dudley continued his goalscoring form, scoring eleven times during the first half of the season before Leeds manager Frank Buckley offered Dudley to Southampton in exchange for Ernie Stevenson, Dudley signing his contract with the Saints during a train journey from Leeds to London."]}, {"page": "Mel Nurse", "response": ["After impressing for the reserves, Nurse signed professional terms with the club in June 1955 before being handed his professional debut on 24 March 1956 in a 6\u20131 victory over Leicester City, following an injury to first choice Tom Kiley. He was informed of his debut by a local sports reporter, Les Bailey, who covered Swansea Town matches and lived nearby to him. His performances in the first-team convinced Swansea to drop Kiley from the side and also cancel a \u00a35000 transfer deal for Cardiff City defender Stan Montgomery."]}, {"page": "Danny Malloy (footballer)", "response": ["Beginning his senior career at Dundee, Malloy eventually moved to Cardiff City in December 1955 for a fee of \u00a317,000 as a replacement for Stan Montgomery.

He was quick in making his mark as a footballing hard man, playing against Middlesbrough on 11 January 1958 he came up against prolific striker Brian Clough. Clough had been verbally riling Malloy throughout the match and as play went towards the Middlesbrough end Malloy swung a punch at Clough leaving him sprawled out on the pitch.\"Clough laid out\" The Cardiff City Miscellany pg.87"]}, {"page": "Paul Wheeler (footballer)", "response": ["Born in Caerphilly, Wheeler began his career at Bristol Rovers, signing as an apprentice after being spotted by one of the clubs scouts Stan Montgomery who scouting the South Wales area.
