Reading appeared stronger at the start, but in the 25th minute Bert Eggo failed to clear the ball from the Reading penalty area, allowing Ferguson to score for Cardiff. The remainder of the match was dominated by the Welsh. A further goal followed in the 35th minute from Harry Wake, sending Cardiff into half-time two goals ahead. Reading pressed on initially during the second half, but Cardiff gradually regained domination of play, and Ferguson scored his second of the game in the 70th minute.

The players kept relaxed with massages, games of bowls and salt baths. On the day before the match, they travelled to Harrow on the Hill where they stayed at the Kings Head Hotel. They were open with the press about their tactics, saying they hoped to subdue Arsenal's attack by having Billy Hardy keep Buchan at bay. Hardy and Cardiff's defence were seen as a key part of the team's chances; ahead of the match, Buchan described them as \"an impassable barrier\". Cardiff were almost free to choose their first choice team. The only omission was Harry Wake who had suffered damage to his kidneys in a league match against Sheffield Wednesday a week before the final. Other than Wake, their team was the same as that which played Reading in the semi-final.

Billy Thirlaway, who had covered Curtis' absence in the league, was also ruled out as he was cup-tied for the game having played in the earlier rounds of the competition for his former club. Curtis was therefore brought back into the starting lineup for the final, becoming the youngest ever player to have appeared in an FA Cup final at the age of 19 years and 317 days.

Cardiff made a last minute change when Len Davies was replaced by Nicholson in the starting line-up and it was Nicholson who opened the scoring after just six minutes when he headed in after a goalmouth scramble from a corner. Gill and Beadles added two further goals after mistakes in the Blackburn defence to give their side an unassailable lead. Blackburn scored a late consolation goal through John McKay but were unable to breach the Cardiff defence again despite sustained pressure.

Fred Keenor later described the build up to the winning goal, commenting \"Wake was in possession of the ball and was facing his own goal when he turned to make a clearance. Tunstall, sizing up the position much quicker than any of our defence, raced in, robbed Wake on the turn, and after advancing about 10 yards shot into the corner of the net.\" Keenor though absolved his teammate of any blame in conceding the goal, adding \"Any blame must be shouldered by the rest of the defence, of which I was one.
