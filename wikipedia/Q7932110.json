He established the field in a textbook which was updated in a number of editions.In particular, he studied metamorphosis. His most significant contribution was the discovery that neurosecretory cells in the brain of the South American kissing bug, Rhodnius prolixus, secrete a crucial hormone that triggers the prothoracic gland to release prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which regulates the process of metamorphosis. This was the first experimental confirmation of the function of neurosecretory cells. He went on to discover another hormone, called the juvenile hormone, which prevented the development of adult characteristics in R. prolixus until the insect had reached the appropriate larval stage. Wigglesworth was able to distort the developmental phases of the insect by controlling levels of this hormone.  From these observations, Wigglesworth was able to develop a coherent theory of how an insect's genome can selectively activate hormones which determine its development and morphology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Juvenile hormone", "response": ["Juvenile hormones (JHs) are a group of acyclic sesquiterpenoids that regulate many aspects of insect physiology.

It was originally described simply as \"brain hormone\" by early workers such as Stefan Kope\u0107 (1922) and Vincent Wigglesworth (1934), who realized that ligation of the head of immature insects could prevent molting or pupation of the body region excluded from the head if the ligation was performed before a critical age in the lifestage was reached.  After a certain point the ligation had no effect and both sections of the insect would molt or pupate.  However, implantation of a conspecific brain to a sessile ligated abdomen or an abdomen under diapause would induce molting or pupation. Thus, the brain was originally thought to be the source of the hormone that induces molting in insects."]}, {"page": "Awards, lectures and medals of the Royal Society", "response": ["|Tercentenary Lectures||align=center|1960||The Tercentenary Lectures were a series of lectures held at the tercentenary of the Royal Society of London in 1960||align=center|Vincent Wigglesworth  1960 ||"]}, {"page": "Messenger Lectures", "response": ["* 1958-1959 Vincent Wigglesworth, Zoology, University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Carroll Williams", "response": ["Carroll Milton Williams (December 2, 1916 in Oregon Hill, Virginia  October 11, 1991 in Watertown, Massachusetts) was an American zoologist known for his work in entomology and developmental biology\u2014in particular, metamorphosis in insects, for which he won the George Ledlie Prize.

He was conscripted into the war under the Royal Army Medical Corps where he met Trevor Shaw. He recollected that they would discuss evolution while on guard duty and were punished to patrol in the snow by a superior officer, a Christian fundamentalist. He then agreed with the officer that fossils had been planted by the devil and spent time indoors next to a fire and explained in later life would humorously argue that pragmatism and opportunism had a role in the survival of the fittest. After the war, he joined the Insect Physiology Unit at Downing College in Cambridge under Vincent Wigglesworth as a lecturer and reader. In 1955 he worked under the Agricultural Research Council to study digestion in Periplaneta americana making use of isotopes to trace the movement of glucose and trehalose. After Wigglesworth's retirement became a university lecturer and in 1971 he became a Reader in Experimental Biology. He headed the chemistry and physiology lab studying insect neurobiology, gut physiology, the chemistry of circadian rhythms and other biochemical studies in insects, annelids and molluscs. He collaborated with Simon Maddrell, Yves Pichon, Michael Bate, Malcolm Burrows and Roger Moreton and his students included Nancy Lane, Simon Maddrell, Mike Berridge, David Sattelle, Peter Evans, Philip Schofield, and Helen Skae. He demonstrated the blood-brain barrier in insects, among the few invertebrates to have them. Treherne served as an editor for several journals, and was the vice-president of the Royal Entomological Society in 1967-68. In later life he began to take an interest in applying science to unsolved criminal mysteries and began to write books for pleasure including The Galapagos Affair (1983), The Strange History of Bonnie and Clyde (1984), Dangerous Precincts (1987). The Galapagos book was produced shortly after his visit to the islands to study the behaviour of Halobates. Among his ideas was the \"Trafalgar Effect\", that groups of Halobates could relay indication of a predator so that even the most distant individuals could take evasive action well before the predator became visible to them."]}]}}
