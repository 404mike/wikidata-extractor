His longest relationship was with the ITV1 soap opera, Coronation Street, for which he wrote 150 scripts between 1970 and 1989. He also helped the development of All Creatures Great and Small, The Tomorrow People,  and Heartbeat.  He contributed several episodes to the British detective programmes  The Gentle Touch, Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, Bergerac and The Bill.  It was for his work as a writer on Goodnight Mr Tom, a bittersweet drama starring John Thaw, for which he received a BAFTA.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Tomorrow People", "response": ["Roger Price dreamed up the idea in 1970; he initially offered the format to Granada, where he was working, but was turned down so offered it to Southern Television, who expressed an interest but had concerns over the budgetary requirements. Finally, Lewis Rudd at Thames Television commissioned a 13-episode series, having seen the potential of the format and looking to replace Ace of Wands after its three-year run. At this time, ITV was keen to find its own answer to Doctor Who, although Price never really envisaged the show as such but more as an outlet for his own personal ideas and beliefs. Very early on, Ruth Boswell was brought in as associate producer and script editor as she had experience of children's fantasy drama (Timeslip and Tightrope) while TV dramatist Brian Finch was hired to co-write the scripts in view of the fact that Price had little experience of writing drama. Finch disliked the experience as he was not engaged by the material and found a large part of his time was taken up in trying to rein in Price and his very ambitious ideas. Thames enlisted the services of Doctor Who director Paul Bernard to help set up and oversee the first series. He would be credited as director for two stories but was unofficially a third producer. Bernard was very heavily involved in the creation of the memorable title sequence which involved a mixture of haunting images and facial shots of the main cast zooming towards the camera in monochrome, with an eerie theme tune from prolific Doctor Who and Blake\u2019s 7 composer Dudley Simpson playing behind. He got inspiration from seeing billboards rushing towards him when driving. The sequence opened with a clenched fist opening out to signify a telepathic mind breaking out. Amongst the next shots were a human foetus, shadowy figures behind scaffolding and even the insides of a bell pepper (a somewhat exotic fruit in the UK in the 1970s)."]}, {"page": "Standish, Greater Manchester", "response": ["* Brian Finch (1936\u20132007), scriptwriter"]}, {"page": "Frank Windsor", "response": ["From 1987 to 1989, he starred in the comedy drama Flying Lady written by Brian Finch.
