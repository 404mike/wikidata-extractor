He is a professor of physics at the University of Oxford and former head of the Sub-Department of Theoretical Physics as well as an Emeritus Fellow of Merton College. Binney is known principally for his work in theoretical galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, though he has made a number of contributions to areas outside of astrophysics as well.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of physicists", "response": ["*James Binney \u2013 England (born 1950)"]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| James Binney || UK || 1950 ||", "*James Binney (UK, 1950\u2013)"]}, {"page": "Dirac Medal", "response": ["* 2010: James Binney (University of Oxford)  For his contribution to our understanding of how galaxies are constituted, how they work and how they were formed."]}, {"page": "List of cosmologists", "response": ["* James Binney (1950\u2013) studied galactic dynamics and supernova disruption of galactic gasses"]}, {"page": "Dennis W.

Dreyer described it as, \"a remarkable object, very faint, very large, very gradually then very suddenly bright middle and 4 arcsec nucleus.

Knapp. He was then a visiting scholar at Oxford University in 1983, where he studied with James Binney.

The Saturnian moons Prometheus and Pandora were first observed in 1981 and shepherding moons were found around Uranus' rings in 1986. Tremaine cowrote the book Galactic Dynamics with James Binney, which is often regarded as the standard reference in the field and has been cited more than three thousand times in scholarly publications. Tremaine, along with collaborators at the University of Toronto, showed that short period comets originate in the Kuiper belt. Tremaine is credited with suggesting that the apparent \"double nucleus\" of the Andromeda Galaxy was in fact a single ring of old red stars."]}, {"page": "James binney", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Binney "]}, {"page": "Mikko Kaasalainen", "response": ["Kaasalainen received an MSc in theoretical physics at the University of Helsinki in 1990, moving shortly afterwards to Merton College, Oxford where he completed his DPhil in theoretical physics in 1994, supervised by James Binney.
