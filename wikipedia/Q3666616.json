In 1852 Britain's first pediatric hospital, the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street was founded by Charles West. The first Children's hospital in Scotland opened in 1860 in Edinburgh. In the US, the first similar institutions were the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which opened in 1855, and then Boston Children's Hospital (1869).

Due to a referral bias, this age may be falsely low. Indeed, the British Medical Association (1887) reported the peak age between 11 and 15 years. In the present series, the female:male ratio was 2.7, in accordance with the general choreic population of Britain towards the end of the 1800s. In children below age 7, the female preponderance is less manifest. This was observed also by Charles West (founder physician of Great Ormond Street Hospital), and subsequently by Osler, who stated that \"the second hemi-decade contains the greatest number of cases in males, and the third the greatest number in females\". In the majority of the 20th century studies, female preponderance is evident only in children over 10 years of age. These observations suggest a role for oestrogen in Sydenham's chorea expression. Supporting this view, oral contraceptives and pregnancy can cause relapses of disease."]}, {"page": "Amersham Hall", "response": ["Charles West, the son of the founder, and one of the pupils for whom the school was founded, went on to be arguably the first paediatrician in the United Kingdom, and to found Gt Ormond St Hospital for Sick Children"]}, {"page": "Charles West", "response": ["Charles West may refer to:", "*Charles West, 5th Baron De La Warr (1626\u20131687), English nobleman", "*Charles West (actor) (1885\u20131943), American silent film actor", "*Charles West (author) (born 1927), British crime mystery writer and actor", "*Charles West (MP), English Member of Parliament for Andover 1678\u20131679", "*Charles West (physician) (1816\u20131898), founder of London's Great Ormond Street Hospital", "*Major Charles West, son of John West III"]}, {"page": "Harveian Oration", "response": ["*1874 Charles West"]}, {"page": "Finsbury Dispensary", "response": ["*Charles West (appointed 1841)"]}, {"page": "Royal Waterloo Hospital for Children and Women", "response": ["*Charles West"]}, {"page": "Obstetrical Society of London", "response": ["*1877 Charles West"]}, {"page": "Alan Moncrieff", "response": ["In 1934, he was elected to a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1934.
