In contrast, various other countries have a dedicated constitutional court that has original jurisdiction on constitutional claims brought by persons or political institutions; for example, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which can declare a law unconstitutional when challenged."]}, {"page": "Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)", "response": ["|Adam Tomkins(Conservative)"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* Adam Tomkins, Member of the Scottish Parliament"]}, {"page": "Tomkins (surname)", "response": ["*Adam Tomkins, British professor of law"]}, {"page": "Jackson Carlaw", "response": ["On 6 January 2020, Carlaw confirmed his candidacy for the February 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election and launched his campaign in Edinburgh on 15 January.

There is not an explicit link with British unionism, as this tends to advocate the Union of Crowns. This is a form of British republicanism which is supported by English politicians such as Dennis Skinner and Jeremy Corbyn, and advocacy groups such as Republic. There is not mainstream support for this concept in any Scottish political parties, and it remains a personal position, unlike support for an independent Scottish republic which does have party support.
