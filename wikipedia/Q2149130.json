According to the Anti-Defamation League, the earliest versions of the teaching did not seem to be racially motivated, but that began to change as the theology was introduced in the United States. The theology arrived in the United States through British Israelite evangelists in the mid-19th century. Rev. Joseph Williams (1826\u20131882), who immigrated from the UK to the USA, was probably the first such evangelist. He lectured on the subject in Boston from 1874 until his death in 1882. His teachings on the subject were published in two periodicals, The Trio and The Trumpet of Israel. Rev. Joseph Wild (1834\u20131908) immigrated from England to Brooklyn during the 1880s.
