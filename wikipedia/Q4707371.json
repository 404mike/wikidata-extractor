He was a right-handed batsman and a leg-break bowler. He played first-class cricket between 1974 and 1980.\nMorris's first-class career began at Derbyshire in 1974, having spent three previous seasons in the Second XI. His first-class debut came in the disastrous 1974 County Championship season, playing out a draw with Essex, and, for the next three years, he was a regular for the Derbyshire team. At the end of the 1977 Championship, however, he saw fewer and fewer appearances in the Derbyshire team, despite their moderately impressive showing that year, and their final league position of seventh.\nMorris played sporadically during the 1978 season, before spending a year out of the first-class game. Towards the end of his first-class career, he played two games with Griqualand West in the 1979/80 Castle Bowl tournament. Griqualand finished bottom of the table that year and Morris was to exit professional cricket.\nMorris was an upper-middle-order batsman for both Derbyshire and Griqualand West.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Morris", "response": ["Alan Morris may refer to:", "*Alan Morris (cricketer) (born 1953), English cricketer", "*Alan Morris (footballer) (1954\u20131998), English footballer", "*Alan Morris (advertiser) (1942\u20132007), Australian advertising creative executive", "*Alan Morris (character), fictional character in The Saga of Darren Shan"]}]}}
