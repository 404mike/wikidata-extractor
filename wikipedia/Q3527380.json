(born 1959)", "wikipedia_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ellison_(cricketer)", "wikipedia_page": {"main": "Richard Mark Ellison (born 21 September 1959) is an English former cricketer who played in 11 Tests and 14 One Day Internationals (ODIs) from 1984 to 1986, playing a key role in the 1985 Ashes series. He was born in Willesborough in Kent.\nA burly, curly haired, right arm medium fast swing bowler, he made his debut for Kent in 1981 and took five wickets against the powerful 1984 West Indian side on his Test debut. As well \"his distinctive mop of hair\", Ellison \"is best remembered for ... the fifth Test against Australia in 1985,\" when, recalled to the national side, he took four wickets for one run in the Australian second innings, thereby completing ten wickets for the match. He took seven more wickets as England wrapped up the series in the sixth Test and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1986.\nAt his best in swinging English conditions, he lacked the raw pace to intimidate batsman under blue skies on tour in the West Indies that winter and his career suffered a further setback when a back injury forced him to miss the 1987 season. He took 71 wickets for Kent in 1988 but was overlooked by England. Ellison joined a 'rebel' tour to apartheid South Africa in 1990 and retired from cricket, aged 33, in 1993, to become Director of Cricket at Millfield School. He was a useful tail ender, good enough to record a first-class century and score 41 in a Test against Sri Lanka in 1984, and took 475 wickets in his 207 first-class games, including 35 Test scalps at under 30 apiece.\nCricinfo summarises Ellison's career as follows: \"With his military-medium pace and gentle late swing Ellison seemed to be the ultimate horse for an English course, but he would only play one more Test on home soil. His Test career was over at 26, just two months after he had become one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year and just nine after he had been England's Ashes darling.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["In 1985, Botham played in all six Tests against a poor Australian team as England, themselves a second-rate team based on their recent performances, comfortably regained the Ashes and he was the leading wicket-taker, but the series was dominated by England's specialist batsmen, especially Mike Gatting and David Gower. Botham, who by this time had adopted a dyed blonde mullet haircut as a trademark, contributed relatively little with the bat, compared with the massive totals amassed by Gower, Gatting, Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson. He scored 250 runs at 31.25 with a highest of 85. He did take the most wickets (31 at 27.58 with a best of five for 109) but he was rarely impressive and he was bowling to a weak batting side, Allan Border apart. England's best bowler was Richard Ellison who played only twice and took 17 wickets at only 10.88 with a best of six for 77 and one 10wM."]}, {"page": "Beckenham", "response": ["Beckenham Cricket Club plays at Foxgrove Road, a former first-class cricket ground.

Over the winter, the side had been settled, with Norman Cowans and Chris Cowdrey playing all five Tests.  Neil Foster and Richard Ellison shared the third spot alongside the spinners, playing two and three Tests respectively. Cowdrey and Ellison had struggled with the ball, both averaging more than 70. However, the side was extensively remodelled for the first Test of that summer's Ashes series. Of the bowlers who had played the last Test in India, only Cowans had survived the cull and it set the tone for the series. England won the first Test, yet dropped Cowans and Peter Willey, replacing them with Phil Edmonds and Foster. After losing the second Test, and struggling with the ball in the third Test, when Australia made 539 all out in their only innings, England decided to make further changes.", "Agnew had performed consistently in county cricket through June and July, culminating in what was to be, statistically, his finest moment as a bowler. Playing against Kent, he took 9\u201370 in the first innings. His timing was perfect and he was called up for the Fourth Test at Old Trafford to partner Ian Botham and Paul Allott in an all-Cheshire born seam attack.  The match finished as a draw, and Agnew failed to take a wicket.  He was relegated from an opening bowler in the first innings, to fifth bowler in the second, in which he only bowled nine overs.
