After World War II he wrote three large books about Nazi Germany.  He was also a painter and collector, mainly of pottery.  Reitlinger's major works were The Final Solution (1953), The SS: Alibi of a Nation (1956), and between  1961\u20131970 he published The Economics of Taste in three volumes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Franjo Tu\u0111man", "response": ["In Horrors of War, Tu\u0111man accepted historian Gerald Reitlinger's estimates that the number of Jewish deaths during World War II was closer to 4 million as opposed to the most quoted number of 5 to 6 million. Aside from the war statistics issue, Tu\u0111man's book contained views on the Jewish role in history that many readers found simplistic and profoundly biased. Tu\u0111man based his views on the Jewish condition on the memoirs of a Croatian former Communist Ante Ciliga, who described his experiences at Jasenovac during a year and a half of his incarceration. These are recorded in his book, Sam kroz Europu u ratu (1939\u20131945), paint an unfavorable picture of his Jewish inmates' behavior, emphasizing their alleged clannishness and ethnocentrism. Ciliga claimed Jews had held a privileged position in Jasenovac and actually, as Tu\u0111man concludes, \"held in their hands the inmates management of the camp up to 1944 [because] in its origins Paveli\u0107's party was philo-Semitic\". Ciliga theorized that the behavior of the Jews had been determined by the more-than-2000-year-old tradition of extreme ethnic egoism and unscrupulousness that he claims is expressed in the Old Testament."]}, {"page": "Austin Osman Spare", "response": ["Spare had moved to South London, to a run-down council flat at 52 Becket House, Tabard Street in Southwark, describing his life there as that of \"a swine, with swine.\"Baker 2011. pp. 138, 141. Here, he developed a great love of radio after the launch of Radio 2LO in 1922.Baker 2011. p. 139. The summer of 1924 saw Spare produce a sketchbook of \"automatic drawings\" titled The Book of Ugly Ecstasy, which contained a series of grotesque creatures; the sole copy of the book would be purchased by the art historian Gerald Reitlinger.Baker 2011. pp. 144\u2013145. The spring of 1925 then saw the production of a similar sketchbook, A Book of Automatic Drawings, and then a further suite of pictures, titled The Valley of Fear.Baker 2011. p. 146. He also began work on a new book, a piece of automatic writing titled The Anathema of Zos: The Sermon to the Hypocrites, which served as a criticism of British society influenced by the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Spare would self-publish it in an edition of 100 copies from his sister's house in Goodmayes, Essex, in 1927.Baker 2011. pp. 144, 155.Reissued: London: Museum Press, 1976 (facsimile; 500 numbered copies). That year he also produced a series of six pictures, each depicting a female head in a different pose, which biographer Phil Baker thought were particularly good; Baker remarked that, during the late 1920s, Spare was actually producing \"some of his finest drawing\", reminiscent in many respects of the work of the Pre-Raphaelites.Baker 2011. p. 156."]}, {"page": "Alois Brunner", "response": ["In a 1985 interview with the West German magazine Bunte, Brunner described how he escaped capture by the Allies immediately after World War II. The identity of Brunner was apparently mixed up with that of another SS member with the same surname, Anton Brunner, who was executed for war crimes. Alois, like Josef Mengele, did not have the SS blood type tattoo, which prevented his identity from detection in an Allied prison camp. Anton Brunner, who had worked in Vienna deporting Jews, was confused after the war with Alois due to the shared surname, including by historians such as Gerald Reitlinger.Schneider, Gertrude, Journey into terror: story of the Riga Ghetto (2nd abbr. edition), Westport, Connecticut, Praeger, 2001, pp. 54, 167; "]}, {"page": "Reich Security Main Office", "response": ["According to British author Gerald Reitlinger, the RSHA \"became a typical overblown bureaucracy...

Reitlinger writes: \"If Nebe did in fact retain his office till 1944, it was because of the five months he spent in Russia, or, as his friend Gisevius politely referred to, 'at the front'.\" Reitlinger calls Nebe a \"very questionable member\" of the German military resistance at the time of the 20 July bomb plot."]}, {"page": "The Destruction of the European Jews", "response": ["Hilberg's \"landmark synthesis, based on a masterful reading of German documents\", soon led to a massive array of writings and debates, both scholarly and popular, on the Holocaust.

Because of this layered departmentalized structure of the bureaucracy overseeing the intricate policies of classifying, mustering and deporting victims, individual functionaries saw their roles as distinct from the actual 'perpetration' of the Holocaust. Thus,'(f)or these reasons, an administrator, clerk or uniformed guard never referred to himself as a perpetrator.' Hilberg made it clear, however, that such functionaries were quite aware of their involvement in what was a process of destruction. Hilberg's minute documentation thus constructed a functional analysis of the machinery of genocide, while leaving unaddressed any questions of historical antisemitism, and possible structural elements in Germany's historical-social tradition which might have conduced to the unparalleled industrialization of the European Jewish Catastrophe by that country."]}, {"page": "Art of the United Kingdom", "response": ["In the modern popular mind, English art from about 1750\u20131790 \u2014 today referred to as the \"classical age\" of English painting \u2014 was dominated by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723\u20131792), George Stubbs (1724\u20131806), Thomas Gainsborough (1727\u20131788) and Joseph Wright of Derby (1734\u20131797). At the time Reynolds was considered the dominant figure, Gainsborough was very highly reputed, but Stubbs was seen as a mere painter of animals and viewed as far a less significant figure than many other painters that are today little-known or forgotten. The period saw continued rising prosperity for Britain and British artists: \"By the 1780s English painters were among the wealthiest men in the country, their names familiar to newspaper readers, their quarrels and cabals the talk of the town, their subjects known to everyone from the displays in the print-shop windows\", according to Gerald Reitlinger.Reitlinger, 58 (quote), 59-75"]}, {"page": "William Hilton", "response": ["In 1813, having exhibited \"Miranda and Ferdinand with the Logs of Wood\", he was elected as an associate of the Academy, and in 1820 as a full academician; his diploma-picture representing Ganymede.
