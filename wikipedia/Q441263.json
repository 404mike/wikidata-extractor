Setting the pace, she took herself, Decker, Smith-Sly and Puic\u0103 clear of the pack.  Running as a group was an unusual situation for Budd and Decker, both of whom were used to running in front and well ahead of other competitors."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Wendy Smith-Sly \u2014 Athletics, Women's 3000 metres"]}, {"page": "Spelthorne College", "response": ["* Wendy Smith-Sly, Olympic athlete who competed mainly in 3000 metres running events"]}, {"page": "Peter Coe", "response": ["As an engineer, Coe became dissatisfied with the athletics coaching offered to his son Sebastian at his first club, Hallamshire Harriers. This training was based on the principles propounded by the New Zealand coach Arthur Lydiard, and involved a substantial amount of long-distance running. By contrast, Coe took the view that \"long slow training turned you into a long slow runner\", and adopted a system of speed-endurance training involving fast repetitions with short recoveries, based on the ideas of the German coach Woldemar Gerschler. He used his fluency in German to translate many East German books on training. Much of his training was also based on self-taught biomechanics, from his background as an engineer. In addition to coaching his son Sebastian, Peter Coe also coached Wendy Smith-Sly, who placed second in the 3000 metres at the 1984 Summer Olympics. He would often refer to himself as Sebastian Coe's coach rather than his father."]}, {"page": "Wendy Smith", "response": ["*Wendy Smith-Sly (born 1959), former British athlete"]}, {"page": "Wendy Sly", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wendy Smith-Sly"]}, {"page": "Brooklands College", "response": ["* Wendy Smith-Sly, athlete who competed mainly in the 3,000 metres; silver medallist at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles; 1983 World Champion in the World 10\u00a0km road race championship"]}, {"page": "1983 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's 3000 metres", "response": ["The final was led from start to finish by Mary Decker-Slaney, a common tactic for her in the USA, but untested at the world level.  Marking her every move throughout the race was the Soviet pair of 1500 metres world record holder Tatyana Kazankina and 3000 metres world record holder Svetlana Ulmasova who expected to use their superior finishing speed.  As Decker gradually increased the pace, the field stretched out to a lead pack of five, with Wendy Smith-Sly and Agnese Possamai.  As the final lap approached, Sly, who ran in the USA frequently, moved to join Decker on her shoulder, while Brigitte Kraus covered the gap to join the lead pack.  The Decker/Sly wall kept the Soviet runners boxed in for half a lap, but when Kraus moved on the rail, Kazankina popped free and the race was on to the finish.  Coming off the final turn Kazankina looked ready to pass Decker, but she never got there as Decker found an extra gear to hold her off.  Kazankina eventually slowed before the finish to be passed by a fast closing Kraus two steps before the line."]}, {"page": "Wendy Smith (athlete)", "response": ["#redirect Wendy Smith-Sly"]}, {"page": "Almond Blossom Cross Country", "response": ["|Wendy Smith-Sly"]}]}}
