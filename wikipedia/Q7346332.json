Historically, water from the lake powered a sawmill situated near the dam, which had ceased to operate by the 1960s. A pumping station is located on the crest of the dam, and water is abstracted for irrigation of the golf course. Because the volume of water impounded by the dam exceeds 25 Ml, the lake is considered to be a reservoir under the terms of the Reservoir (Safety Provisions) Act 1930, and visual imspections are made every week by a Reservoir Supervisor Engineer, while the crest of the dam is regularly surveyed for any signs of settlement of the dam, of which there were none as of 2014."]}]}}
