He was unable to make the first team at Anfield and joined Wigan Athletic in July 1984. Stewart made 14 league appearances in two years at Springfield Park before former Latics manager Harry McNally signed him for Chester City in August 1986. After initially sharing goalkeeping duties with John Butcher, Mike Stowell and Mike Astbury, Stewart established himself as a starting goalkeeper. Between January 1988 and October 1990 he did not miss a match; his run of 124 games only ended after a sending-off at Bradford City. In 1992\u201393 Stewart was named as the club's player of the season (despite conceding more than 100 goals), but a pre-match injury at Scarborough in September 1993 sidelined him for the remainder of the following season. Stewart was allowed to join Northampton Town in July 1994, but ended the season playing at Wembley Stadium for Chesterfield in the Football League Division Three playoff final against Bury (while on loan with the Saltergate club). He helped Chesterfield to a 2\u20130 victory and promotion, and returned to Chester in the summer of 1995. Stewart missed only one game in 1995\u201396, but at the end of the season he dropped into gon-league football with Southport. Stewart played for the Sandgrounders for three and a half years, making another trip to Wembley in the final of the 1997\u201398 FA Trophy (which ended in a 1\u20130 defeat to Cheltenham Town). Stewart moved to fellow Conference side Hednesford Town in December 1999 and later played for such clubs as Bamber Bridge, Rhyl, Marine and Colwyn Bay."]}, {"page": "Andy Leaning", "response": ["Leaning had trials with York City in 1979 at the age of 16 and he went on to play for York Railway Institute and Rowntree Mackintosh in the Northern Counties East Football League as an amateur while working for British Rail. He later played in York's reserve team and was offered the chance to turn professional with the Third Division club in July 1985. Following an injury to first choice goalkeeper Mike Astbury, Leaning made his first team debut in a 1\u20131 draw at Newport County on 6 November. He played in all of York's seven FA Cup games in the 1985\u201386 season and his \"finest\" performance came in York's 3\u20131 defeat after extra time against Liverpool at Anfield in the fifth round on 18 February 1986, being named man of the match following a \"heroic\" performance. He was able to do a \"fine job\" in Astbury's absence during the 1985\u201386 season, which he finished with 39 appearances in all competitions. He made 47 appearances for York in all competitions in the 1986\u201387 season."]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 York City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=row|Mike Astbury"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mike Astbury"]}]}}
