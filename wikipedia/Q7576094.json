But while young listeners were not interested in their new music, their longtime fans were a little discouraged by the modern sound.", "The album was recorded mainly at Coconut Studio in Hennef near Bonn.

Not having the time available to spend an extended period in a studio, they resorted to completing the work in a manner they had never tried before. \"Basic computer-generated drum tracks were laid down ahead of our arrival by our appointed producer, Hans Steingen, along with synthesised string and keyboard pads to provide a bedrock on which we could add our own contribution,\" wrote Frank Allen in his autobiography. \"Guitars, both six string and twelve string, were layered on top of the prepared tracks followed by lead voices and harmonies which naturally incorporated the trademarks of our long-established sound.\"", "* Spencer James \u2013 lead vocals, lead guitar, rhythm guitar"]}]}}
