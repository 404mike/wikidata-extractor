He played in 16 games for Port Vale in the Football League in the 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons. A former Manchester United youngster, he later played for non-league sides Moor Green, Stafford Rangers, Hednesford Town and Gresley Rovers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2000\u201301 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with a disappointing 4\u20131 defeat at Boundary Park to Oldham Athletic, though the Vale then recovered to record two 3\u20130 victories. Two points from the next seven games follow, turning hopes of promotion into fears of relegation, and putting pressure onto Horton. During this run the Vale renewed hostilities with rivals Stoke City, recording a 1\u20131 draw at Burslem on 17 September. Their form stabilized with a four-game unbeaten run throughout November, but then no points were gained from any of the four December games. Horton attempted to sign Isaiah Rankin on loan from Bradford City, but Bill Bell rejected the move as he felt the wage bill was already too high. In January, young striker Steve Brooker was signed from Watford for a \u00a315,000 fee. Jamaican international striker Onandi Lowe also arrived on a short-team deal, and Wayne Gray joined on loan from Wimbledon. Vale then found their feet in February, and managed to avoid defeat to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, as they lost just three of their final 21 league games. In March, Jeff Minton was transferred to Rotherham United, and Ashley Dodd arrived at Vale Park on loan from Manchester United. The next month Richard Burgess also joined the club after leaving Bromsgrove Rovers. A cup run and numerous fixture postponements meant the club were forced to play eight games in April, of which only two ended in defeat; for this achievement Horton was named Manager of the Month. The 1 May draw with Manor Ground was the final match in the stadium's 125-year history. Two days later, the final home game of the season, Billy Paynter made his debut aged only 16 years and 294 days.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||28||align=\"left\"| Ashley Dodd", "| 22 March 2001 || MF ||  || Ashley Dodd || Manchester United || 7 May 2001 || "]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw Brian Horton sign numerous bit-part players on free transfers: Ashley Dodd (Manchester United); Ian Armstrong (Liverpool); Phil Hardy (an eleven-year Wrexham veteran); Rae Ingram (Macclesfield Town); and Alex Gibson (Stoke City).
