He made his Football League debut in April 1954 against Manchester City, but did not appear in the first team again for almost 18 months. He made 23 league appearances during his four-year spell at the club. In July 1958, he was sold to Southend United in a part exchange deal which saw Southend's John McGuigan join Newcastle. A year later he joined Norwich City, where he made over 200 league appearances. He also scored for Norwich in the 1962 Football League Cup Final against Rochdale.

In the second victory of the season (2\u20130 over Newcastle United on 18 September) Burnside injured his knee and was out until mid-January, losing his place to John McGuigan. Although Burnside returned for a run of six games from mid-January to mid-February, including scoring in the 7\u20132 victory over Scunthorpe United on 29 January 1964, he was forced to sit out the remainder of the season, until the postponed final game of the season at home to Rotherham United in which he returned to score in a 6\u20131 victory (thereby helping Saints notch up 100 league goals for the season), with Saints finishing in fifth place."]}, {"page": "McGuigan", "response": ["*John McGuigan (born 1932), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Barrie Thomas", "response": ["Thomas began his career as a youth player with Leicester City. His senior career began with Leicester City as a seventeen-year-old in 1954, but over the next three seasons, Thomas only managed to play in seven league games, scoring three league goals in the process. Thomas moved to Mansfield Town in 1957, and spent two seasons with the club, scoring 48 league goals in 72 league games. Thomas' next club was Scunthorpe United, moving there in 1959. Thomas' form in the 1961\u201362 season saw him score 30 league goals in 22 league games by Christmas 1961, and a total of 31 goals in 24 games in all competitions. Thomas' goalscoring record attracted attention from First Division clubs including Manchester United, Bolton Wanderers and Fulham. Leeds United had a bid of \u00a330,000 rejected by the Scunthorpe United board of directors. However, Thomas was eventually sold to Newcastle United in January 1962 in a part-exchange deal, which saw John McGuigan moving in the opposite direction. Newcastle also paid Scunthorpe either \u00a335,000, or \u00a345,000. In his three seasons at Scunthorpe, Thomas scored 67 league goals in 91 league games. Thomas' exit had a detrimental effect on Scunthorpe United's season; attendances at their home matches fell by 20% after Thomas left, and the club dropped from 1st to 4th in the League. Thomas spent two years at Newcastle United, scoring 48 goals in 73 games, before returning to Scunthorpe in 1964. Thomas spent a further two years at Scunthorpe, scoring 26 goals in 52 games in his second spell with the club. Thomas' final club was Barnsley, where he scored 19 goals in 43 games over two years, before retiring in 1968 because of injury."]}, {"page": "Jack McGuigan", "response": ["#REDIRECT John McGuigan"]}, {"page": "McGuigan, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn McGuigan"]}]}}
