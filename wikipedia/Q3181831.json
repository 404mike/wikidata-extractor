He was Professor of Economic Organisation at Merton College, Oxford.His main work, Ordeal by Planning, was written in 1946 and argued that the central planning implemented in the United Kingdom during World War II will lead to poverty if it is adopted as a permanent economic system, a thesis quite similar to the one developed by Friedrich Hayek in 1945 in The Road to Serfdom. His line of thought was close to the ordoliberal thesis of Wilhelm R\u00f6pke and Walter Eucken.\nHe is also remembered for his book The Sources of Invention (1958), written with two research assistants, David Sawers and Richard Stillerman.  It is based on 50 case studies of 19th century and 20th century technological innovations and is considered a pioneering study in the economics of innovation.\nHe was president of the Mont Pelerin Society from 1962 to 1964.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mont Pelerin Society", "response": ["* John Jewkes \u2013 United Kingdom, 1962\u20131964"]}, {"page": "Ely Devons", "response": ["He worked as an economic assistant in Manchester at the Joint Committee of Cotton Trades Organisations over the period 1935\u20131939 and was brought into the Ministry of Supply, as a statistician working on Cotton Control, soon after the outbreak of the Second World War.
