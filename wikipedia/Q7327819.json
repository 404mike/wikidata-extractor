He was considered one of the best professional cricketers of his era.\nMills was born at Pump Farm, Benenden in Kent in 1798. He made his first-class debut in 1825 for a Kent side against one from Sussex at Brighton, going on to play a total a total of 47 first-class matches. A left-handed batsman and left arm medium pace roundarm bowler, Mills played mainly for Kent sides, including one match for the newly formed Kent County Cricket Club in 1843 at Hemsted Park near his home in Benenden. He played six times for the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series, four times for England sides and for the South in the North v. South series.Mills was considered one of the strongest professionals in the country. Benenden produced a number of fine cricketers and, in 1836, Mills played with fellow Kent and Benenden man Ned Wenman against a full side of 11 players from the Isle of Oxney on the border between Kent and Sussex. Mills and Wenman won the match which had been organised as a wager. The event is recorded on the Benenden village sign.Mills came from a cricketing family which on at least one occasion is reported to have played as a family side against Benenden. His brother, George, played occasionally for Kent sides between 1825 and 1829, making his debut in the same match as Richard. George also played in the 1831 Gentlemen v Players match, possibly a match which Richard had been invited to play in but, due to the method of addressing professionals simply by their surname, the invitation is reported to have been misunderstood.A benefit match was played for Mills in 1861 at Swifts Park in Cranbrook. He retired to Rolvenden in Kent where he died in 1882 aged 83.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "North v South", "response": ["* 2 \u2013 Alfred Mynn, Bartholomew Good, Charles Creswell, Francis Fenner, George Rothera, Jem Broadbridge, Richard Mills, Tom Adams, William Hillyer"]}, {"page": "Roundarm trial matches", "response": [":All-England: William Searle, James Saunders, William Ward, Tom Marsden, Fuller Pilch, EH Budd, Thomas Beagley, George T Knight, Henry Kingscote, George Osbaldeston, Richard Mills"]}, {"page": "Richard Mills", "response": ["Richard Mills may refer to:", "*Richard Mills (composer) (born 1949), Australian composer and conductor", "*Richard Mills (cricketer) (1798\u20131882), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Swifts Park", "response": ["Three cricket matches are known to have taken place within Swifts Park during the 1860s when the estate was owned by Robert Tooth.
