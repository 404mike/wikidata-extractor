Katherina's opening speech in 4.3, beginning with \"the more my wrong, the more his spite appears\" was delivered in the form of a voice-over, an unusual technique at the time. The production is also notable insofar as when she hugs Petruchio after her climactic speech, she winks at the camera. Diana E. Henderson writes \"this version relentlessly reiterates conventional post-war ideas of gender difference [...] the production as a whole serves to legitimatise the domestication of women.\" In 1952, BBC Television Service screened a live adaptation as part of their Sunday Night Theatre series, directed by Desmond Davis and starring Margaret Johnston and Stanley Baker. In 1956, NBC's Hallmark Hall of Fame screened the first colour television adaptation, directed by George Schaefer, and starring Lilli Palmer and Maurice Evans (who also produced).
