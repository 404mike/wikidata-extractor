In Paris, at a banquet held in his honor on April 4, 1859, a laurel wreath was placed over the head of a bust of Morphy, carved by the sculptor Eug\u00e8ne-Louis Lequesne. Morphy was declared by the assembly \"the best chess player that ever lived.\" At a similar gathering in London, where he returned in the spring of 1859, Morphy was again proclaimed \"the Champion of the World\". He was also invited to a private audience with Queen Victoria. So dominant was Morphy that even masters could not seriously challenge him in play without some kind of handicap. At a simultaneous match against five masters, Morphy won two games against Jules Arnous de Rivi\u00e8re and Henry Edward Bird, drew two games with Samuel Boden and Johann Jacob L\u00f6wenthal, and lost one to Thomas Wilson Barnes.G\u00e9za Mar\u00f3czy, Paul Morphy.

However, on arrival he found that the tournament had been postponed by two months, to August 24. Morphy traveled to London the following day but had fallen ill, and was not fit to visit the London chess clubs until June 23. The Illustrated London News, of which Staunton was the chess editor, printed an article \"Arrival of Mr. Morphy\" on June 26. At the St. George's club he met Staunton and re-issued the challenge, which Staunton accepted provided he was given a month to prepare. Although he declined to play a few casual games against Morphy, Staunton invited him to his home in Streatham, which in those days was a country village whose first railway station had opened only two years earlier. There they played a couple of consultation games, with Staunton partnered by John Owen and Morphy by Thomas Wilson Barnes. The Morphy-Barnes team defeated Staunton-Owen in both consultation games. A little later Staunton proposed that they delay their match until after the Birmingham tournament in August, and Morphy reluctantly agreed.
