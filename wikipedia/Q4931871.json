He played for Raith Rovers and Dundee before joining Manchester United in May 1903. He helped them to promotion to the First Division in the 1905\u201306 season and made a total of 134 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring three goals. He was a combative player and during the promotion season was at the centre of a serious incident after Manchester United's match at Bradford City. His treatment of Bradford player Jimmy Conlin during the match enraged the crowd and after the game Bonthron was attacked by home supporters. Criminal charges followed against the perpetrators and a Football Association (FA) inquiry resulted in the temporary closure of Bradford City's Valley Parade ground.He joined Sunderland in May 1907, playing 24 games, before moving on the following year to Northampton Town, with whom he won the Southern League championship in the 1908\u201309 season.

The first association football game to be played at Valley Parade was a promotional fixture on 6 April 1903 between a side of West Yorkshire footballers and Sheffield United's 1903 FA Cup winning side. The game had been organised to stimulate interest in the sport in Bradford and attracted 8,000 fans. The new football club, Bradford City, were elected to The Football League's Division Two the following month. Bradford City's first game at Valley Parade came on 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a crowd of 11,000. As a result of alterations first implemented in 1897, City players originally changed in a shed behind one end of the ground, and visiting teams used the old rugby club dressing rooms at the back of the nearby Belle Vue Hotel. However, after City's 5\u20131 defeat by Manchester United on 10 February 1906, United player Bob Bonthron was attacked as he left the ground. As a result, The Football Association closed the ground for 14 days, ordering City to switch its changing rooms to the nearby Artillery Barracks for the 1906\u201307 season. Several supporters faced criminal proceedings for the incident."]}, {"page": "Dick Holden", "response": ["Richard H. Holden (born 12 June 1885 in Middleton, Lancashire) was an English footballer who played at right-back. He started playing football at Parkfield Central as a forward. He then joined Tonge, where he started playing as a full back. In May 1904, Holden joined Manchester United, and spent most of his first season at United in the Reserves. In the season 1905-06, an injury to Bob Bonthron allowed Holden to play for the first-team. In 1908, he suffered a knee injury, and had to go for an operation. After 117 appearances for the club and no goals, he left United in May 1914 and joined the Royal Air Force, serving in the First World War that began three months later. When the war ended in November 1918, Holden did not resume his career as a footballer."]}, {"page": "1903\u201304 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Bob Bonthron"]}, {"page": "James Conlin", "response": ["Another of the more notable events in Conlin's career occurred during his time at Valley Parade. He was at the centre of an infamous incident involving Manchester United's right full back, Bob Bonthron, in a 1\u20135 home defeat played on 10 February 1906 during the latter club's promotion season. Both players had a reputation as being combative players; Conlin was tricky and feisty and Bonthron strong and burly, and they repeatedly clashed during the game. Bonthron's continual rough treatment of Conlin enraged the home crowd, with the result that after the game he was attacked by some of the home supporters and the United team was pelted with missiles as they left the stadium. This incident made national news headlines. Criminal charges followed against the perpetrators, and a subsequent F.A. inquiry resulted in the temporary closure of Bradford City's Valley Parade ground for the first two weeks of March 1906. During his two seasons playing for Bradford City, Conlin scored five goals in 61 league appearances, and a total of ten goals in 67 appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Tom Daykin", "response": ["Daykin finally established himself in Sunderland's first team halfway through the 1906\u201307 season. He came into the side for a visit to Woolwich Arsenal in early December when Watson was rested, and \"played excellently\" in a 1\u20130 win; the Athletic News noted that \"even when beaten, he made some remarkable recoveries.\" He recovered from influenza just in time to stand in for Watson when he fell ill with the same complaint at the end of January, and missed only two more league matches that season, playing either alongside Watson or in his place. Daykin began the 1907\u201308 season as first choice at left back, partnering new signing Bob Bonthron, but other players were tried in mid-season. He came back into the side in March, but this time lost his place through injury.  He was retained for 1908\u201309, and played in the opening fixture, but was dropped in favour of Tommy Tait, and made just three more appearances for Sunderland before moving on. His last match was the local derby against Newcastle United in December 1908. Sunderland took an early lead before the visitors equalised with a penalty just before half-time. Sunderland regained the lead two minutes into the second half, and in the next half hour scored seven more goals to make the final score 9\u20131; it remains the club record league away win."]}, {"page": "1904\u201305 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Bob Bonthron"]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Bob Bonthron"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FB||align=\"left\"| Bob Bonthron"]}, {"page": "1909 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["|RB ||2 || Bob Bonthron"]}]}}
