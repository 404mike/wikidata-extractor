The Cassel Hospital by Ham Common, London had a reputation for treating patients in a therapeutic environment and she moved there in 1948 to follow their recently developed course in psychosocial treatment and nursing for nervous disorders. Skellern joined the Cassel Social Therapy Unit as a permanent staff member in 1949. There she worked with Tom Main on pioneering psychotherapeutic and psychosocial treatments. During her time at the Cassel she underwent psychoanalysis herself and observers said she found it easier to collaborate with analytically-inclined doctors and nurses.Winship, Bray, Repper and Hinshelwood, 'Collective biography and the legacy of Hildegard Peplau, Annie Altschul and Eileen Skellern; the origins of mental health nursing and its relevance to the current crisis in psychiatry', Journal of Research in Nursing, November 2009 pp505-517", " An Eileen Skellern Memorial Lecture series in her honour began in 1982.

In 1976, together with colleagues Nancy Roper, and Winifred W. Logan, and founded on the work of Virginia Henderson, she developed the 'activities of living'  nursing care model commonly referred to as the Roper\u2013Logan\u2013Tierney model of nursing. New editions were published in 1985, 1990 and 1996 and, with translation into many languages, it became well known around the world and of particular interest in some European centres, for example in the nursing school of the University of Heidelberg which had implemented nursing theories from the US as early as 1953.  Roper, Logan and Tierney\u2019s model has underpinned much nursing practice in the UK and beyond and  its use and evaluation was reviewed by the authors in a final monograph published in 2000. She worked in Edinburgh with Annie Altschul. In 1980, with Roper and Logan, she published The Elements of Nursing. This nursing model became the basis for the activities in daily life care model in European centres led by Juchli and  further developed by Monika Krohwinkel. Activities of Living care research was reviewed and updated by the authors through 2000 and has underpinned much nursing practice in the UK and beyond. For example, the nursing school of the University of Heidelberg implemented nursing theories from the US and the UK as early as 1953, including the theory of Roper, Logan and Tierney."]}]}}
