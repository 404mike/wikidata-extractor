During his career, Moran knocked out former lightweight king Battling Nelson and also fought boxing greats Jim Driscoll, Packey McFarland, Abe Attell, Ad Wolgast, Frankie Neil and George Dixon. Moran retired in 1916 with over 100 fights.

Moran held the BBBC Flyweight Championship of Great Britain in 1903 and would compete several times for the bantamweight championship of his native land.  Moran fought with more telling blows which won him the decision.  By the sixth, both fighters were fatigued, and in the seventh, Moran hooked a strong left to the jaw of Attell staggering him, and causing him to fall against the ropes as the round ended.  Moran tried to finish Attell through the final ten rounds, but was unable, as his opponent would retreat or clinch to save himself.
