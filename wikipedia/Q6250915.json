There he found first-team opportunities easier to come by, but a change of manager at the end of the 1997\u201398 season meant he fell out of favour again and was sent on loan to Burnley at the start of the 1998\u201399 season. He went on loan again to Bolton Wanderers at the start of 1999\u20132000, a move that was made permanent a month later. \nAfter two years with Bolton, he moved to Blackpool, where he spent another two years before retiring due to injury. He came out of retirement again soon after to play for Hyde United, where he spent a further three seasons before his final retirement in 2006.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Graeme Tomlinson", "response": ["He had a brief loan spell at Wimbledon in 1995, featuring in their makeshift squad for the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup along with fellow United players Michael Appleton and John O'Kane, and then returned to Old Trafford to play in the reserve team."]}, {"page": "Michael Appleton", "response": ["Born in Salford, Greater Manchester, Appleton attended Seedley Primary School and Buile Hill Secondary School, both in Salford.
