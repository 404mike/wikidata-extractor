He attended Grove House School, Tottenham and London University where he was awarded a B.A. degree in 1848.\nHe was a banker and M.P. for the Penryn and Falmouth Constituency, (1868\u20131874) and Conservative M.P. for the City of London Constituency (1880\u20131891). He was also elected Sheriff of the City of London for 1880 and Lord Mayor of London in 1883 and 1885, the last Lord Mayor to serve multiple terms. He was created a baronet in 1885.\nHe was the author of A visit to Japan, China and India.According to Frank Harris, an admittedly unreliable source, Fowler excited the disgust of his fellow guests at a dinner given by William Thackeray Marriott by breaking wind copiously, and being apparently unconscious of giving offence.George Shaw-Lefevre MP noted that, due to plural voting (whereby property owners could vote both in the constituency where their property lay and that in which they lived), Fowler had no fewer than thirteen votes in different constituencies. At one General Election Fowler managed, energetically, to use all thirteen votes in one day.In 1890, Fowler was described as \"of Gastard, Wilts., a JP and DL for Middlesex and Wilts, an Alderman of London\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
