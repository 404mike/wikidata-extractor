From 1903 to 1904 he played a small part (the First Watchman) in The Cherry Girl at the Vaudeville Theatre in London. From 1904 and for eight years he made annual appearances at the London Ballad concerts held at both the Queen's Hall and Royal Albert Hall.  He performed in numerous concerts at most of the leading provincial British theatres. In 1907 he joined \"Randall Jackson's Concert Party\" at the Oval in Margate in which he had Hugh E. Wright, Carrie Tubb and Fred Wildon as fellow artists, and it was this association which gained him his eventual popularity. For several summers Ritte ran his own companies in the Worthing, Westgate and Swanage areas of the south coast of England. In 1912 the Ariel Grand record catalogue made the following appraisal of his career:Since his first appearance as a member of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, twelve years ago, Mr. Ritte's career has been an uninterrupted success. He has appeared before enthusiastic audiences in all the principal London concert halls and is well known in oratorio in the largest provincial centres."]}, {"page": "Houp La!", "response": ["Houp La! is an Edwardian musical comedy extravaganza, with music by Nat D.

Both Pearson and Balfour were particular favourites of the British film critic, and later leading screenwriter, Roger Burford. In his first article for the magazine Close Up Burford would write \"Not long ago a film of the Squibbs series was reported to be on at a small cinema in a slum district. It was a rare chance, and we went at once. We were not disappointed: the film was English, with proper tang; the tang of Fielding or Sterne.'Roger Burford, 'What Next, and Then?', Close Up Vol. II, no. 2 (February 1928) p. 41 Burford's comments help place the Squibbs films perfectly in British culture between the wars. They were very much working-class comedy, drawing on a vernacular, performative tradition, but at the same time their \"Englishness\" is characteristic of the kinds of satirical comedies found in the novels of Henry Fielding and Laurence Sterne. That earthy satire, based on everyday life, made these comedies unpalatable to middle class audiences but the Squibbs films were amongst the most interesting, and well shot, films in Britain in the 1920s.", "* Hugh E.
