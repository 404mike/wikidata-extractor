He started work aged 9, and was apprenticed to the bookbinding trade. He served as a journeyman in Bath, Brighton and London, eventually starting his own business in Huddersfield in 1896. At the same time he was employed as a lecturer by the Land Restoration League, visiting agricultural labourers in various counties. He married Lucy Rushworth of Halifax, and they had one son.Riley was a founding member of the Independent Labour Party, and was elected to Huddersfield School Board in 1896 and to Huddersfield Town Council in 1904.At the 1918 general election Riley stood as the Labour Party's candidate in the Dewsbury constituency, but failed to be elected. At the next election in 1922 Riley won the seat, but lost it the following year. In 1924 he regained the seat. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Noel Buxton, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the Labour Government of 1929-1931. At the 1931 general election he lost his seat, along with many other Labour Party MPs.Riley returned to the Commons at the 1935 general election. He held the seat until the 1945 general election, when he retired.He died at his home in Huddersfield in January 1946, aged 80.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ben Riley"]}, {"page": "Riley (surname)", "response": ["*Ben Riley (1933\u20132017), American jazz drummer", "*Ben Riley (politician) (1866\u20131946), British politician"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Riley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Riley (politician)"]}, {"page": "Ben Riley (MP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Riley (politician)"]}, {"page": "Ben Riley", "response": ["* Ben Riley interview at All About Jazz"]}, {"page": "Colne Valley Labour Union", "response": ["The party was reorganised in 1900, becoming the Colne Valley Labour League (CVLL), and its membership again began increasing, particularly once the Labour Party performed well in the 1906 UK general election.  By 1907, it had 691 members, and it was determined to stand a candidate in the 1907 Parliamentary by-election.  It considered seven possible candidates: Edward Black, Charlie Glyde, Victor Grayson, T. E. Moorhouse, William Pickles, Ben Riley and Russell Williams.  Moorhouse was disqualified for having held membership for less than a year, Black and Glyde were deemed unsuitable, and Williams withdrew, preferring to contest Huddersfield.  William Crawford Anderson and Ben Turner were added to the list late on.  A delegate meeting voted for Anderson and Grayson as its two preferred options, to go forward to a ballot of all members.  However, Anderson decided to withdraw, and Grayson was thereby selected.  The ILP sent a delegation of J. Howard and Philip Snowden to decide whether to give financial backing to the candidacy; they recommended it do so, but the ILP decided to wait on a decision of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee, and that ultimately decided not to support it.  Grayson therefore stood as the candidate of the Colne Valley Labour League, and narrowly won the election on a strongly socialist platform."]}, {"page": "National Administrative Council", "response": ["| Ben Riley", "|rowspan=3| Ben Riley", "| Ben Riley", "|rowspan=11| Ben Riley"]}]}}
