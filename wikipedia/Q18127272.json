The same XI atoned for that display with a 4\u20130 victory over Shrewsbury Town four days later, but the view had become prevalent around Griffin Park that some of Brentford's settled XI were past their peak. Manager MacDonald tinkered with his squad and bit-part, reserve or youth players Tommy Higginson, John Docherty, Ron Peplow and Johnny Hales were given runs in the team. Amidst a run of just two wins in 19 league matches, the new Football League Cup gave the Bees some cheer when Second Division club Sunderland were defeated 4\u20133 at Griffin Park in the club's first-ever match in the competition. The Bees were knocked out after a replay versus reigning Football League champions Burnley in the third round. A first round exit in the FA Cup in November ensured that the Third Division would be Brentford's sole focus for the remainder of the season.", "|Ron Peplow", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Ron Peplow", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Ron Peplow", "| Ron Peplow"]}, {"page": "Peplow (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Ron Peplow (1935\u20132019), English former professional football"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 in English football", "response": ["* 15 March 2019: Ron Peplow, 83, Brentford wing half."]}, {"page": "2019 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Ron Peplow, 83, English footballer (Brentford)."]}, {"page": "2019 in England", "response": ["**Ron Peplow, 83, English footballer (Brentford).", "**Ron Peplow, 83, English footballer (Brentford)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2019", "response": ["*Ron Peplow, 83, English footballer (Brentford).Ron Peplow RIP"]}]}}
