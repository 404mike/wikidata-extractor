John Balance and Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson founded Coil in 1982 in London, England, after collaborating on a few side projects and following their departure from Psychic TV.   Other collaborators, such as Drew McDowall and Danny Hyde, would frequently record with the band, some becoming members for a time.  By the time Coil arrived at Nothing Records, they had released three studio albums.   Scatology and Horse Rotorvator were released on Force & Form, which was manufactured and distributed by K.422, a sister label of Some Bizzare Records.  Love's Secret Domain was released on Torso in Europe and the seminal Wax Trax! Records in the United States.  These albums has helped establish Coil as one of the premiere acts in experimental and industrial, prior to joining Nothing Records."]}, {"page": "Coil (band)", "response": ["Coil were an experimental music group, founded in 1982 in London, England and concluded in 2005. Initially envisioned as a solo project by musician John Balance (of the band Psychic TV), Coil evolved into a full-time project with the addition of his partner Peter Christopherson (formerly of pioneering industrial music group Throbbing Gristle). Balance and Christopherson were the only constant members; other contributors throughout the band's career included Stephen Thrower, Danny Hyde, Drew McDowall, William Breeze, Thighpaulsandra, and Ossian Brown. Coil's work explored themes related to alchemy, the occult, and sexuality, influencing genres such as goth rock, neofolk, and dark ambient. AllMusic called the group \"one of the most beloved, mythologized groups to emerge from the British post-industrial scene.\"", "* Drew McDowall began collaborating with Coil in 1990 and was officially inducted in 1995.

Her first venture into music was in the Poems, an art-punk trio formed in 1978 with her then-husband Drew McDowall. She then formed Strawberry Switchblade in 1981 with Jill Bryson. After signing with Warner Bros. Records, they enjoyed chart success with their single \"Since Yesterday\" in 1984; however, later singles and an album did not sell as well as expected.

As well as this, Balance intended the album to cause \"temporal slips\": he commented that the musical effect was demonstrated when the group \"listened to it loud [and] lost track of time\". Drew McDowall created the original demo for the record, at first inspired by what he saw as a hypnotic state created in Tibetan music, but his final idea with Balance and Christopherson was to use filters and oscillators on the tones of the demo to induce trance-like effects.", "A five-disc Time Machines box set was announced in 1998, but never developed. A two-disc version was announced in January 2006 as a future release,  but this was never expanded on either, although an album by Peter Christopherson, called Time Machines II, was released posthumously.
