He spent his entire career with Arsenal Football Club.\nBorn in Hackney, he went to school in the Highbury area and attended Finsbury Park commercial college. He was married to Clare (n\u00e9e Nightingale) until his death in 1981.  They didn't have any children. He joined Arsenal in 1928 as a clerical worker, handling the club's box office and manager Herbert Chapman's personal correspondence. He soon gained Chapman's trust and assisted with transfer deals. In his very first deal at Chapman's side, when Chapman signed David Jack from Bolton Wanderers, Wall would later recall that Chapman made sure the Bolton directors' drinks contained double measures while his own had no alcohol whatsoever. When the Bolton directors got very drunk, Chapman managed to haggle down the fee to a price he considered a bargain.Wall continued to work for Arsenal for nearly 50 years. He became assistant secretary in 1950 and secretary of Arsenal Football Club six years later. After secretary-manager Tom Whittaker died, the club decided to split the role, with Jack Crayston taking over the role of manager. Described by Arsenal captain Frank McLintock as \"an authoritarian personality\", Wall would eventually come to be effectively in charge of the club's day-to-day running with the board of directors taking a backseat role.In 1973, Wall became Arsenal's general manager. Ken Friar succeeded him as secretary. In 1969, Wall published his own account of life at the club in Arsenal from the Heart (ISBN 0285502611). He  retired from his position 1977, accepting a position on the club's board that he retained until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbert Chapman", "response": ["It was the signing of David Jack in particular that highlighted Chapman's cunning when it came to transfer negotiations. Bolton Wanderers had originally asked for a fee of \u00a313,000, almost double the existing record. Bob Wall, Chapman's personal assistant at the time, later recounted the negotiations he made with Bolton's directors as follows:Soar & Tyler, p. 51"]}, {"page": "David Jack", "response": ["In 1928, with Bolton in financial trouble, Herbert Chapman's Arsenal made Jack the first five-digit signing in world football, almost double the previous record. Recollections of the exact figure vary, from \u00a310,000, to \u00a310,890, to \u00a311,500; all agree it was the first five-digit figure. According to Bob Wall, Chapman negotiated the transfer with Bolton's representatives in a hotel bar, his tactic being to drink gin and tonics without any gin in them, while asking the waiter to double the alcohol served to the other side. Chapman remained sober while the Bolton representatives got very drunk, and managed to haggle down the fee to a price he considered a bargain."]}, {"page": "Robert Wall (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Bob Wall (football administrator) (1912\u20131981), former secretary and director of Arsenal Football Club", "*Bob Wall (ice hockey) (born 1942), Canadian ice hockey player"]}, {"page": "Ken Friar", "response": ["Ken Friar was educated at St John's School, Highbury and Highbury County Grammar School after passing the eleven-plus. Friar began working at Arsenal part-time as a 12-year-old. He left school in 1950 and started work in the club's box office. Friar rose through the club ranks and became company secretary replacing Bob Wall in 1973. During this time, he took part in discussions held in the 1970s between the boards of Arsenal and rivals Tottenham Hotspur FC to share a new stadium at Alexandra Palace. In 1983, he was appointed managing director by chairman Peter Hill-Wood, a role he lasted in until 2000. During this time, Friar has taken an active role in negotiating manager and player contracts as well as fostering Arsenal's links with the community and supporter groups. He stepped down from this role to concentrate on the club's move to the Emirates Stadium and served on the board until September 2020 when he retired. On 1 May 2008 it was announced that he had become acting managing director on the resignation of Keith Edelman prior to the appointment of Ivan Gazidis."]}]}}
