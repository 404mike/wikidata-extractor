He followed his father's profession from his youth, and added to it the art of etching, which he developed with great success, being induced to do so by a careful study of Piranesi's 'Roman Antiquities.' He went to Chester, where he became a teacher of drawing, and published, in 1810 and 1811, Six Etchings of Saxon and other Buildings remaining at Chester, Six Etchings of Old Buildings in Chester, and Six Etchings of Picturesque Buildings in Chester and, in 1815, five etchings for a History of Chester. \nAbout 1820, having realized a certain competence by his labours, he retired from the more active duties of his profession, and built a house at Masham, near Richmond, from where he published his Yorkshire Abbeys, and in 1848 his collected works, under the title of Wanderings and Pencillings amongst the Ruins of Olden Times. These etchings exhibit considerable talent, verve, originality, and truth. \nHe died at Masham in 1854.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richmond, North Yorkshire", "response": ["* George Cuitt the Younger, painter"]}, {"page": "George the Younger", "response": ["*George Cuitt the Younger (1779\u20131854), only son of the George Cuitt the Elder"]}, {"page": "George Cuitt the Elder", "response": ["Cuitt was born at Moulton, in Yorkshire, and having shown a natural taste for drawing and design was sent to Italy at the expense of Sir Lawrence Dundas, whose family had already been painted by him. He studied earnestly for six years at Rome, and also pursued landscape painting, a branch of art that was more congenial to his tastes. He returned to England in 1775, and in 1776 he exhibited at the Royal Academy The Infant Jupiter fed with goat's milk and honey. He afterwards exhibited portraits and landscapes, his last contribution being in 1798. Owing to frequent attacks of low fever he was unable to reside in London, and he finally settled at Richmond in Yorkshire. There he found ready employment in the commissions given him by gentlemen whose parks and residences were in his neighbourhood. His portraits are elaborately finished, although very thinly painted, whilst his earlier landscapes show much ability and feeling in their execution.  His son was the artist George Cuitt the Younger."]}, {"page": "George Cuitt", "response": ["*George Cuitt the Younger (1779\u20131854), his son, English painter"]}, {"page": "George Cuitt Jr.", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Cuitt the Younger"]}, {"page": "George Cuitt Junior", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Cuitt the Younger"]}, {"page": "List of painters in the National Gallery of Art", "response": ["*George Cuitt the Younger (1779\u20131854), British : Easby Abbey, near Richmond, oil on canvas, ID: 1959.1.1"]}]}}
