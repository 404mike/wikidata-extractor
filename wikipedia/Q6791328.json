However, The Ports' challenge began to fade following an injury to Tipton, and Linfield finished comfortably as champions.", "The 2012\u201313 season saw Matthew Tipton sign for champions Linfield and Portadown sent a strong message to rivals when it was announced they had beaten strong competition from The Blues for Shamrock Rovers striker Gary Twigg, who scored on his debut, although The Ports could only muster a seventh-place finish.", "What followed was a run of fixtures that was of huge importance which started with a well deserved 2\u20131 win over Loughgall with many thinking that the team had hit form at just the right time, and provided consistent results in the \"next nine cup finals\" a play off position would almost certainly materialise. The positivity was quickly eroded however following a 1\u20130 defeat away to Ballyclare Comrades in the first of nine crucial fixtures and what was the 4th defeat that season to Ballyclare. The following fixture saw a 0\u20130 draw with the Welders in a game where the Ports, with so much riding on every game created virtually nothing worth noting the whole day. The game saw the end of Niall Curries tenure as Portadown manager who was relieved of his duties following the result. In February 2018 it was confirmed that Portadown had made an approach and had been successful in appointing ex striker and Warrenpoint Town boss Matthew Tipton with David Miskelly joining as his assistant.", "|  Matthew Tipton "]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["Linked with the management position at Swansea City, Horton was instead appointed as manager of struggling Third Division club Macclesfield Town at the start of April 2004, replacing John Askey, who stayed on as a coach. This was initially until the end of the season, but Horton was given the job on a permanent basis in May. He rejuvenated a demoralised side and kept them in the Football League, as they finished seven points clear of the relegation zone in 2003\u201304. Over the summer he signed Iraqi international Jassim Swadi, experienced striker Mike Sheron, veteran defender Tony Barras, left-back Mark Bailey, and Tommy Rooney. He allowed Martin Carruthers to leave, though extended Tommy Widdrington's contract, and offered fresh deals to six others. He later added to his squad by signing Mark Boyd and Simon Weaver; whilst transfer listing Tommy Widdrington and Michael Welch. Many pundits were tipping the \"Silkmen\" to slip out of the newly named League Two at the end of the 2004\u201305 season, but Horton proved the observers wrong as his side were in the top-seven of the division virtually all season long. Horton celebrated his 1000th game as a manager on 3 November 2004, as Macclesfield beat Mansfield 4\u20130 in the Football League Trophy. He also won the League Two Manager of the Month award for February. Macclesfield qualified for the play-offs in sixth place, but their promotion challenge was finally ended by Lincoln City in the semi-finals, following a 2\u20131 aggregate defeat. At the end of the season, Horton released nine players, including club captain Matthew Tipton.

Shortly after, Day suffered a broken leg in a home game against Oldham Athletic after a challenge with striker Matthew Tipton. As part of his lengthy recovery plan, he was loaned to non-League Aylesbury United in October 2002, and made his debut for the club in a 0\u20130 home draw against Harrow Borough.
