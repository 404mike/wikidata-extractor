He later joined the Don Rendell Sextet (1954\u201355) and The Ivor and Basil Kirchin Band (1955\u201356), together with Stan Tracey, and was later with the Basil Kirchin Small Band. He would return to record with Tony Crombie in the late 1950s.\nBy 1962 he was leading his own quartet, which included Harry South and Dick Morrissey, and spent several months in India.Shortly after their return to the UK, Kozak started working as an executive at Brian Epstein's NEMS Enterprises, as well as managing artists such as Shawn Phillips (1965\u201367), Donovan (1965 to May 1968), and the duo Michael-Claire (1968).\nHe produced Marc Brierley's second album for CBS Records, Hello (1969), the band Clear Blue Sky (1970\u201371), and put together the band Tranquility, who were described as a \"hybrid of pop, rock and English folk music\", and were active from 1971 to 1974.\nKozak died in 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donovan", "response": ["In late 1965, Donovan split with his original management and signed with Ashley Kozak, who was working for Brian Epstein's NEMS Enterprises. Kozak introduced Donovan to American businessman Allen Klein (later manager of the Rolling Stones and in their final waning months, the Beatles). Klein in turn introduced Donovan to producer Mickie Most, who had chart-topping productions with the Animals, Lulu, and Herman's Hermits. Most produced all Donovan's recordings during this period, although Donovan said in his autobiography that some recordings were self-produced, with little input from Most. Their collaboration produced successful singles and albums, recorded with London session players including Big Jim Sullivan, Jack Bruce, Danny Thompson, and future Led Zeppelin members John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page."]}, {"page": "List of jazz bassists", "response": ["*Ashley Kozak (c. 1930 \u2013 2008)"]}, {"page": "Kozak (surname)", "response": ["* Ashley Kozak, British jazz bassist, record producer and artists' manager"]}, {"page": "Hurdy Gurdy (band)", "response": ["From Denmark, MacLeod wrote to Donovan's manager Ashley Kozak on 19 December 1967 to ask if he could help the band in any way.

After hearing Donovan's demo tape, the band set up outside his Little Berkhamsted cottage and played their version of the song.
