He is known principally for his work on legal and ethical issues in end-of-life decision-making and euthanasia, surgery and paediatrics and is the author of a number of books on these themes; Law, Ethics and Compromise at the Limits of Life: To Treat or Not to Treat? (2012), Euthanasia, Ethics and the Law: From Conflict to Compromise (2007) and (with Dickenson & Parker) The Cambridge Medical Ethics Workbook (CUP, 2nd edn, 2010). He has also produced numerous chapters, and articles for both academic journals and mainstream newspapers.\nHuxtable is best known for his controversial position on the role of \"principled compromise\" in responding to conflict over the care of a critically ill, incapacitated patient. Huxtable has argued that the law governing both the welfare (or \"best interests\") of the patient and any wishes they might have conveyed, via an \"advance directive\" or through the appointment of a \"lasting power of attorney\", frequently fail to furnish clinicians and families with the guidance they require in these difficult cases. He has proposed that there is a case for \"principled compromise\" here, and has argued for greater ethical engagement, through a reinvigorated system of clinical ethics support, in which committees work alongside the courts to resolve the conflicts that can arise at the limits of life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Right to die", "response": ["* Richard Huxtable"]}, {"page": "Huxtable", "response": ["* Richard Huxtable, British medical ethicist"]}, {"page": "Huxtable, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Huxtable"]}]}}
