He was a right-handed batsman who played for Gloucestershire. He was born in Merriott, Somerset and died in Lambridge, Bath, Somerset.\nCross made his first-class debut in July 1870 against Surrey. From the lower order, he scored a duck in the only innings in which he batted, as Gloucestershire won the match by an innings margin, restricting Surrey to what was, at the time, their lowest first-class score against a county side.\nCross' second and final first-class appearance came the following week against the MCC, against whom he scored his only runs in first-class cricket in the first innings of the match. Gloucestershire again won this match by an innings margin, thanks to an innings of 172 from WG Grace, and Cross scored five runs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Cross", "response": ["* Joseph Cross (actor) (born 1986), American actor", "* Joseph Cross (cartographer) (1821\u20131865), English cartographer", "* Joseph Cross (cricketer) (1849\u20131918), English cricketer", "* Joseph Cross (judge) (1843\u20131913), New Jersey state legislator and judge", "* Joseph Cross (trade unionist) (1859\u20131925), British trade unionist", "* Joseph Cross (tower) (German: Josephskreuz), an architecturally significant observation tower"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Joseph Cross (1870) : J.
