Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry. As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market. Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly the Beatles.P. Humphries, The Complete Guide to the Music of the Beatles (Music Sales Group, 1998), p. 83. There were a handful of significant British blue-eyed soul acts, including Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones.R.
