The star of the team was Hudson, who scored twenty-one goals before Christmas, and City were nine points clear at the top of the table by January. They then suffered a reversal of fortune, going eleven games without victory, and by February the lead was down to just one point. Hill made some changes, including the emergency signing of George Kirby as a controversial replacement for the temporarily-out-of-form Hudson. City appeared to have missed out on promotion when they lost 2\u20130 at Peterborough in April, but they were saved by some poor results for their rivals and a winner by the returning Hudson in a final-day victory over Colchester, giving them the championship. The club's first two seasons back in the second tier resembled the pre-war seasons of 1936\u201337 and 1937\u201338: in 1964\u201365 they started very well, briefly going top of the table after five games, but eventually finishing with a solid mid-table finish. Then, in 1964\u201365, followed a genuine promotion challenge as Coventry missed out by a point. Hill courted controversy once more by selling George Hudson during the season to Northampton for \u00a329,000. New signings during this time included goalkeeper Bill Glazier and striker Ian Gibson, while local player and future manager, Bobby Gould, began to appear regularly in the side.", "Having narrowly missed out the previous season, Coventry were promoted to Division One in 1966\u201367. After a solid start, they suffered a loss of form and were in tenth place in November. Hill angered supporters yet again by dropping their favourite striker, in this case Ian Gibson. After a defeat at Carlisle, Gibson and Hill had an altercation in the dressing room and Gibson was dropped and transfer-listed on his own request. As the club continued to slide, Hill and Gibson eventually made up and the forward was returned to the side for a 3\u20132 win over Cardiff, in which he scored twice. The team then achieved a run of twenty-five straight games without defeat, with Gibson playing a vital role in the revival. Promotion was confirmed in April when rivals Blackburn drew at home to Bolton, but Division Two title was still at stake as Coventry played their penultimate game of the season against Wolves, who were also already promoted. The match, played on 29 April 1967, attracted the largest crowd in Highfield Road's history with an official gate of 51,455 and probably many thousands more who were not counted. Dubbed the \"Midlands Match of the Century\" by Hill, the game was dominated by Wolves for the first hour, and the visitors led 1\u20130 at half time. It was Coventry's day, however, as Ian Gibson created two goals and scored one to record a 3\u20131 victory. This was followed up with a City win and a Wolves defeat on the final day, giving Coventry the championship."]}, {"page": "Ian Gibson (footballer born 1943)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Gibson (footballer, born 1943)"]}, {"page": "2016 in association football", "response": ["* 25 May: Ian Gibson, Scottish footballer (born 1943)"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 in Scottish football", "response": ["*25 May: Ian Gibson, 73, Scotland under-23 international."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 in English football", "response": ["* 25 May 2016: Ian Gibson, 73, Accrington Stanley, Bradford Park Avenue, Middlesbrough, Coventry City, Cardiff City and A.F.C.
