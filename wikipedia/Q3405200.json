Their marriage was a stormy affair, fuelled by alcohol and infidelity, though the couple remained together until Dylan's death in 1953. After his death, she wrote the book Leftover Life to Kill, an account of her self-exile to Italy.  She paints a portrait of a grieving widow seeking solace in distance, a younger lover, and alcohol.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dylan Thomas", "response": ["Caitlin Thomas's autobiographies, Caitlin Thomas\u00a0\u2013 Leftover Life to Kill (1957) and My Life with Dylan Thomas: Double Drink Story (1997), describe the effects of alcohol on the poet and on their relationship. \"Ours was not only a love story, it was a drink story, because without alcohol it would never had got on its rocking feet\", she wrote,Thomas, C. (1997), p. 1 and \"The bar was our altar.\"Thomas, C. (1997), p. 9 Biographer Andrew Lycett ascribed the decline in Thomas's health to an alcoholic co-dependent relationship with his wife, who deeply resented his extramarital affairs.Lycett (2003) In contrast, Dylan biographers Andrew Sinclair and George Tremlett express the view that Thomas was not an alcoholic.. Tremlett argues that many of Thomas's health issues stemmed from undiagnosed diabetes.", "Thomas disliked being regarded as a provincial poet and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry. When he wrote to Stephen Spender in 1952, thanking him for a review of his Collected Poems, he added \"Oh, & I forgot. I'm not influenced by Welsh bardic poetry. I can't read Welsh.\" Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that \"His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background\". Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked \"in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings.

However, it won Thurman good notices; The New York Times wrote: \"Thurman, as the Brooklyn-accented June, takes a larger-than-life character and makes her even bigger, though the performance is often as curious as it is commanding.\" After playing Maid Marian in the 1991 British adventure film Robin Hood, Thurman began filming Dylan Thomas, a biopic on Welsh poet Dylan Thomas starring her then-husband Gary Oldman with herself as Caitlin Thomas, however the project was shut down shortly after filming began. Thurman went on to star as the patient of a San Francisco psychiatrist in the neo-noir drama Final Analysis (1992), opposite Richard Gere and Kim Basinger, and as a blind woman romantically involved with a former policeman in the thriller Jennifer 8 (also 1992), with Andy Garc\u00eda."]}, {"page": "Gary Oldman", "response": ["In 1991, Oldman began filming Dylan Thomas, a biopic on Welsh poet Dylan Thomas, with his then-wife Uma Thurman as Caitlin Thomas, however production was shut down shortly after filming began.

In 1969, while reading Henry Miller's The Time of the Assassins, his study of Arthur Rimbaud, Robbins became aware of Kenneth Rexroth's poetry through Miller's reference to Rexroth's remarkable \"Memorial\" for Dylan Thomas,poetryfoundation.org  \"Thou Shalt Not Kill,\" about which Miller stated, \"If one has any doubts about the fate which our society reserves for the poet, let him read this \"'Memorial.'\" During this early period of development Robbins had preceded reading Miller's book on Rimbaud with The Diary of Najinsky, Van Gogh's Letters, Kenneth Patchen's The Journal of Albion Moonlight, Jack Hirschman's Artaud Anthology, and Wilhelm Reich's The Murder of Christ, making the connection to Rexroth's elegy for Thomas timely in the way that it lyrically and convincingly categorizes and specifies the violent multi-faceted alienation of society with the vulnerability and ensuing martyrdom of certain artists. As suggested by Robbins' prose poem monologue \"My Dylan Thomas,\" the Welsh poet was an inspiration and an early influence. At age eighteen Robbins attended a production of Sidney Michaels' Dylan: A Play Based On Dylan Thomas In America By John Malcolm Brinnin and Leftover Life To Kill By Caitlin Thomas. The production was an inspiration adding to Robbins's continuing study of Thomas's poetry with a new emphasis on sound, voice, and prosody in general."]}, {"page": "Caitlin MacNamara", "response": ["#REDIRECT Caitlin Thomas"]}, {"page": "BIFA Award for Best Supporting Actress", "response": ["| Caitlin Thomas"]}]}}
