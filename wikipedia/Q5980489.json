King was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2013 Birthday Honours, for services to governance in Libya, Afghanistan and Kosovo.\nHe is a Scholar at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and a former Fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and at Cambridge University.After seven years work on the Northern Ireland peace process in the 1990s, Iain King held a senior political role in Kosovo\u2019s UN Administration, and co-authored a book on the history of Kosovo and the difficulties of post-war state-building in the Balkans, called Peace at Any Price: How the World Failed Kosovo.\nHis 2008 book, How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong, starts with a history of moral philosophy and then develops a hybrid methodology for ethical decision-making. King's approach has been described as quasi-utilitarian, and credited with reconciling competing systems of ethics.Secrets of The Last Nazi, based on extensive research of the Nazi era, was King's debut novel, first published in 2015. A sequel followed in 2016.Making Peace in War is about Afghanistan.King has been featured as a foreign policy analyst on CNN and BBC, and has written for multiple outlets, many of them based in the US, including NBC, Defense One, Prospect, and National Interest.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Consequentialism", "response": ["However, consequentialism and virtue ethics need not be entirely antagonistic.

Other consequentialists consider effects on the character of people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues.

Intuitively, there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account. As Alastair Norcross has said:[S]uppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the building...it is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number, precisely because it is a larger number.... Can anyone who really considers the matter seriously honestly claim to believe that it is worse that one person die than that the entire sentient population of the universe be severely mutilated? Clearly not.It may be possible to uphold the distinction between persons whilst still aggregating utility, if it accepted that people can be influenced by empathy.In Moral Laws of the Jungle (link to Philosophy Now magazine), Iain King argues: \"The way I reconcile my interests with those of other people is not for all of us to pour everything we care about into a pot then see which of the combination of satisfied wants would generate the most happiness (benefit). If we did that, I could be completely outnumbered... No, the way we reconcile interests is through empathy. Empathy is one-to-one, since we only imagine ourselves in the mind of one other person at a time. Even when I empathise with 'the people' here... I am really imagining what it is like to be just one woman. I cannot imagine myself to be more than one person at a time, and neither can you.\" Link accessed 2014-01-29.
