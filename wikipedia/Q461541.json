Despite Celtic's successes, by 1983 he was being paid less than the managers of Aberdeen, Dundee United, Rangers and St Mirren.

Paul McStay scored twice in the first half, and came close to getting a hat-trick when he struck the crossbar in the second half. Charlie Nicholas scored Scotland's third goal. Stein observed that Scotland \"won with style\" and singled out winger Davie Cooper along with McStay for the flair they both displayed. The Scots turned in an even better showing in their next tie, a 3\u20131 home win over Spain. Two first half headed goals from Mo Johnston gave Scotland a 2\u20130 lead at half-time. Spain pulled a goal back in the second half, but with 18 minutes remaining Kenny Dalglish dribbled past three Spanish defenders before striking a powerful shot high into the net for Scotland's third. It was Dalglish's 30th international goal, equalling the record held by Denis Law. Stein described the win over Spain as \"the most satisfying since I became [Scotland] manager\", adding that \"we scored three goals against a quality team that came to defend\". Spanish manager Miguel Mu\u00f1oz praised the Scots' performance, describing them as \"tremendous\". Performances and results were more mixed in the later qualifying ties, losing the return match in Spain, going down to a 1\u20130 defeat against Wales in Glasgow and scraping a narrow 1\u20130 win over Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk. Scotland went into their last qualifying tie, away to Wales, needing at least a draw to secure a play-off spot."]}]}}
