He modelled the town closely on the neolithic pile dwellings that have been found on Swiss lakes, probably based on an artist's conception of such a town such as in Robert Munro's 1908 Les stations lacustres d'Europe aux ages de la pierre et du bronze. The scholars Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull note that in an earlier drawing, two Dwarves can be seen crawling out of their barrels, with Bilbo still invisible as he was wearing the Ring, whereas the finished drawing shows the barrels without Dwarves, perhaps at the moment just before Bilbo started to let them out; an Elf, poling the raft, has been added. The text of The Hobbit states that night had fallen and the Men of the town had gone indoors to eat, while in the drawing, it is still day and swan-headed boats (based, they note, on those in Tolkien's painting The Halls of Manw\u00eb for The Silmarillion) are still being rowed about the lake."]}, {"page": "1882 in archaeology", "response": ["* Robert Munro - Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings or Crannogs."]}, {"page": "1835 in archaeology", "response": ["* 21 July - Robert Munro, Scottish archaeologist (d. 1920)."]}, {"page": "1920 in archaeology", "response": ["* 18 July: Robert Munro, Scottish archaeologist (b. 1835)"]}, {"page": "Robert Munro", "response": ["Robert Munro may refer to:", "* Robert Munro, 6th Baron of Foulis (died 1323)", "* Robert Munro, 14th Baron of Foulis (died 1547), Scottish soldier and clan chief", "* Robert Munro, 18th Baron of Foulis (died 1633), Scottish soldier, 21st chief of Clan Munro", "* Sir Robert Munro, 3rd Baronet (died 1668), 24th chief of Clan Munro", "* Sir Robert Munro, 5th Baronet (died 1729), 26th chief of Clan Munro", "* Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet (1684\u20131746), Scottish soldier and politician, 27th chief of Clan Munro, son of the above", "* Robert Munro (archaeologist) (1835\u20131920), Scottish archaeologist", "* Robert Munro (folklorist) (1853\u2013?), Scottish minister and author", "* Robert Munro, 1st Baron Alness (1868\u20131955), Scottish Liberal politician and judge", "* Robert Munro (rugby union) (1839\u20131913), Scottish rugby union international and Church of Scotland minister", "* Sir Robert Munro (lawyer) (1907\u20131995), New Zealand-born lawyer in Fiji"]}, {"page": "Rhind Lectures", "response": ["\t\tRobert Munro, MA MD., Author of Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings"]}, {"page": "1920 in Scotland", "response": ["* Secretary for Scotland and Keeper of the Great Seal \u2013 Robert Munro", "* Robert Munro, archeologist, (born 1835)"]}, {"page": "1882 in Scotland", "response": ["* Archaeologist Robert Munro publishes Ancient Scottish Lake Dwellings or Crannogs."]}, {"page": "1835 in Scotland", "response": ["* 21 July \u2013 Robert Munro, archaeologist (died 1920)"]}, {"page": "University of Edinburgh School of History, Classics and Archaeology", "response": ["* Dr Robert Munro \u2013 a distinguished medical practitioner who, in his later life, became a keen archaeologist."]}, {"page": "List of titles in the Home University Library of Modern Knowledge", "response": ["*  by Robert Munro, 1913.
