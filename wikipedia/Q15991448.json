However, the pair (and several other Scots in the squad) were unable to achieve promotion from the English second division and both departed from Deepdale in 1929. After two years with Chester, he returned to Scotland with Dundee United in 1931.Morris received all six of his caps for Scotland (and one for the Scottish Football League XI) while with Raith Rovers. He is the only serving player from the Kirkcaldy club to have been international captain and appeared for his country six times in total, finishing on the winning side five times with the other match drawn.", "link_mentions": {}}}
