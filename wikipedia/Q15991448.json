However, the pair (and several other Scots in the squad) were unable to achieve promotion from the English second division and both departed from Deepdale in 1929. After two years with Chester, he returned to Scotland with Dundee United in 1931.Morris received all six of his caps for Scotland (and one for the Scottish Football League XI) while with Raith Rovers. He is the only serving player from the Kirkcaldy club to have been international captain and appeared for his country six times in total, finishing on the winning side five times with the other match drawn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Morris", "response": ["David Morris may refer to:", "* David Morris (actor) (1924\u20132007), English painter and actor", "* David Morris (musician) (born 1964), musician and radio personality", "* David Morris (author), writer and scholar, emeritus professor of literature at the University of Virginia", "* David Morris (writer), American author and Vice-President of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance", "* David Morris (Whig politician) (1800\u20131864), Member of Parliament for Carmarthen, 1837\u201364", "* David Morris (Wisconsin politician) (1849\u20131914), American farmer and politician", "* David Morris (Labour politician) (1930\u20132007), Welsh politician and member of the European Parliament", "* David Morris (Australian politician) (born 1955), Australian politician and member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly", "* David Morris (Conservative politician) (born 1966), member of the UK House of Commons elected 2010", "* David Morris (English footballer) (1888\u2013?), English footballer in the 1910s", "* David Morris (Scottish footballer) (1897\u20131971), Raith Rovers FC and Scotland player", "* David Morris (footballer, born 1957), Welsh professional footballer", "* David Morris (soccer) (born 1978), Canadian soccer defender", "* David Morris (skier) (born 1984), Australian 2014 Olympic Aerial Skiing Silver Medallist", "* David Morris (jeweller), British jeweller", "* David Morris (snooker player) (born 1988), Irish snooker player", "* David Morris (United States Army officer), American general", "* David Morris, one of the two defendants in the McLibel case"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Andrew Cunningham, David Morris"]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (1920\u20131939)", "response": ["|Andy Cunningham, David Morris"]}, {"page": "William Collier (footballer)", "response": ["His introduction into professional football was delayed until he was in his late 20s due to World War I, during which he served in the Fife and Forfar Yeomanry and the Black Watch.
