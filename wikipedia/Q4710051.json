It was to be remarkable debut for him, Manchester United were the reigning League Champions and had been unbeaten in the last 26 games but Everton won 5\u20132. In the next game Arsenal were beaten 4-0 and Dunlop kept his place until the end of the season.\nDunlop was unchallenged for the goalkeeper's jersey for the next six years and in 1960-61 was an ever-present and helped the club to 5th in the first division, their highest post war position. The following season, he was to play in the first 29 games before being replaced by Gordon West as Everton started to build for the future.\nDunlop's last game for Everton was to be the club's best post war moment as they beat Fulham at Goodison Park to clinch the 1962-63 League title, during the summer he was to leave and joined Wrexham. He then joined Rhyl in September 1965 as a goalkeeper initially, and by February 1966 had been appointed full-time manager and commercial director of the club. He was quite a flamboyant character, and when the club was going through a rough patch he once selected himself as centre-forward to see what the problems were at first hand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Everton F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Albert Dunlop||||GK||1956\u20131963||231||0"]}, {"page": "Gordon West", "response": ["West played as a defender for Barnsley, Don and Dearne Boys, but when accompanying a friend to a trial with Blackpool decided to try out as a goalkeeper.

He was offered a part-time contract with Welsh side Rhyl, managed by Albert Dunlop, who were playing in the Cheshire League.

His form attracted attention from several clubs and Dunlop personally travelled with Allan in an attempt to secure a transfer. The pair later met Tony Kay, who warned Allan that Dunlop was using the transfer as a way of making money for himself. Allan instead returned to Rhyl where the chairman confirmed the suspicions and instead contacted Cardiff City."]}]}}
