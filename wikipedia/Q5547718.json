But one night Alice is chased down and killed by wolves. While her parents are mourning, Rosaleen goes to stay with her grandmother (Angela Lansbury), who knits a bright red shawl for her granddaughter to wear.

He was proven capable of causing chaos wherever he went, ruining relationships and even causing death.

However Matthew was also characterised as a notorious womaniser, enjoying flings with the likes of Louise Appleton (Emily Symons). However he is arguably best remembered for his affair with his brother Jimmy's (Nick Miles) wife Sadie (Patsy Kensit), which helped to show that the character would go to any lengths to get his own way. However another more vulnerable side of Matthew was shown through his romantic liaison with Perdita Hyde-Sinclair (Georgia Slowe), the wife of Matthew's stepbrother Grayson Sinclair (Christopher Villiers). Matthew and Perdita's relationship helped viewers to relate to Matthew's more romantic side. His more vulnerable side was also explored through his relationship with former fianc\u00e9 Anna De Souza (Emma Davies).

Matthew took a keen interest in Perdita, having had a one-night stand with her. This deepened into friendship and they became close, supporting each other when necessary. He wanted a more intimate relationship but she stayed with her husband, Grayson Sinclair (Christopher Villiers). Matthew realised Rosemary was responsible for Perdita's troubles after Rosemary drugged her and had her sectioned. He supported Perdita as he felt responsible for Rosemary moving into Mill Cottage and they grew closer. Perdita, however, struggled with her feelings for him as she wanted to make her marriage work, especially after she discovered Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward), now her surrogate, was pregnant. Matthew stunned Perdita by telling her he would wait for her and raise the baby as his own, if it meant he could be with her.  Perdita was thrilled and they carried on their affair but Grayson found out and framed Matthew for his mother's \"murder\". Perdita realised Matthew wasn't guilty when she found evidence and a letter from Rosemary, sent from Miami. Perdita told Grayson that she knew and demanded he clear Matthew's name. She kept the cardigan and used it to blackmail Grayson for sole custody of the baby. She promised, in return, that she wouldn't tell the police that he had helped frame Matthew. She left him on Christmas Day 2007 and moved in with Matthew. However, this only lasted 3 months as Matthew discovered Perdita had attacked Katie so she almost miscarried and Grayson told him that she knew about the attempt to frame him. Matthew was so horrified, he threw her out and ended their relationship.
