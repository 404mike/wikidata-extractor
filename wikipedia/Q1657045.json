Nazlymov's new goal was to guide his new team to win an NCAA crown and produce a new generation of US Olympic fencers.  In the 2003\u201304 and 2007-08 seasons, Nazlymov guided Ohio State Buckeyes to the NCAA Collegiate Fencing National Championship, as well as produced several individual NCAA champions (Adam Crompton, Boaz Ellis, Andras Horanyi) and numerous All-Americans.  In 2004, two of Nazlymov's students, Jason Rogers and Louise Bond-Williams qualified for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Most recent OSU Fencing team member and Nazlymov's student Siobhan Byrne participated in 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China.
