The Garrison Room, a nightclub, was established in the basement of the building. Mills was subsequently convicted in 1963 at Bow Street Magistrates' Court under the Betting and Gaming Act in a case involving the legality of charges imposed in Chemin de fer at Le Cercle but his appeal was successfully heard at the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in December 1963 in Mills v. Mackinnon. John Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby lost \u00a3165,000 in an evening gambling at the club in the 1960s. The extent of Derby's losses caused the souring of Mills's relationship with fellow casino owner John Aspinal, who had previously had Derby as a regular patron. Le Cercle lost their gambling licence in 1978 following convictions against the company and a former manager for breaches of the gaming act."]}, {"page": "Edward Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Stanley, 18th Earl of Derby"]}]}}
