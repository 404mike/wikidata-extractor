He won the Birmingham Senior Cup with Hednesford, before his goal scoring record won him a move to Football League club Macclesfield Town in May 2010. He was voted the club's Player of the Year for 2010\u201311, and won a move to Crawley Town in June 2011. He was named on the 2011\u201312 League Two PFA Team of the Year, and joined Peterborough United on loan in February 2012, which was made into a permanent move at the end of the season for \u00a31.1 million.\nHe struggled with injuries and discipline issues in the 2012\u201313 season, and was loaned out to Ipswich Town in November 2012. The 2013\u201314 season was more positive, though he was still allowed to join Bristol City on a four-month loan in January 2014. He joined Oxford United on loan in September 2014, before he was sold on to Shrewsbury Town in February 2015.

However, despite continued success in the FA Cup, form slipped. Between 17 December 2011, and 13 March 2012, Crawley won just two league games out of a possible 14. Many argued the sales of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett for \u00a3800,000 and \u00a31,100,000 respectively, as well as failing to reach a deal over Andy Drury contributed to their dip in form. Three Crawley players were involved in a post-match brawl against Bradford City, including former club captain Pablo Mills (suspended for six matches) and fellow defender Claude Davis (suspended for four matches). Five players from both clubs were suspended in total equalling the record for the most dismissals in an English game. Consequently, Crawley were fined \u00a318,000. Following an FA inquiry into the events that took place, Kyle McFadzean was handed a four-game suspension after being found guilty of violent conduct. All three players have since released apology statements, and were all fined two weeks' wages. Despite apologising, Mills was stripped of his captaincy for behaviour not befitting the role of a club captain. He was released by the club at the conclusion of the 2011/12 season.", "On 9 April, it was announced that Steve Evans had parted company with Crawley to take up a post at Rotherham United. Evans revealed \"In my opinion, how far can I take Crawley Town? League One certainly, but beyond that I was not so sure\". Evans had previously admitted frustration over the departures of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett. Assistant manager Paul Raynor also left the club with immediate effect, with coach Craig Brewster taking over as manager for the remainder of the season.

However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget...

On 9 April 2011 Crawley clinched promotion to Football League Two for the 2011\u201312 season.
