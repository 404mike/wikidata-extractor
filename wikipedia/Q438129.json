Over her career, she was associated with many notable European artists of her era, including Kathleen Scott, Adrienne Gorska, Le Corbusier, and Jean Badovici, with whom she was romantically involved. Her most famous work is the house known as E-1027 in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 9", "response": ["*1878 \u2013 Eileen Gray, Irish architect and furniture designer (d. 1976)"]}, {"page": "Art Deco", "response": ["Besides the Cubist artists, Doucet brought in other Deco interior designers to help in decorating the house, including Pierre Legrain, who was in charge of organizing the decoration, and Paul Iribe, Marcel Coard, Andr\u00e9 Groult, Eileen Gray and Rose Adler to provide furniture. The decor included massive pieces made of macassar ebony, inspired by African art, and furniture covered with Morocco leather, crocodile skin and snakeskin, and patterns taken from African designs.", "File:Le salon de verre, designed by Paul Ruaud, furniture by Eileen Gray, for Madame Mathieu-Levy (boutique J.

In 1932 the decorator Paul Ruaud made the Glass Salon for Suzanne Talbot. It featured a serpentine armchair and two tubular armchairs by Eileen Gray, a floor of mat silvered glass slabs, a panel of abstract patterns in silver and black lacquer, and an assortment of animal skins.", "In 1925, two different competing schools coexisted within Art Deco: the traditionalists, who had founded the Society of Decorative Artists; included the furniture designer Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Jean Dunand, the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and designer Paul Poiret; they combined modern forms with traditional craftsmanship and expensive materials. On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration, inexpensive materials, and mass production. The modernists founded their own organization, The French Union of Modern Artists, in 1929. Its members included architects Pierre Chareau, Francis Jourdain, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, Konstantin Melnikov; the Irish designer Eileen Gray, and French designer Sonia Delaunay, the jewelers Jean Fouquet and Jean Puiforcat. They fiercely attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function. The beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfill its function. Modern industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand.Le Corbusier, Vers une architecture, Flammarion, republished in 1995, page xixLarousse Encyclopedia on-line edition (in French)"]}, {"page": "1976", "response": ["* October 31 \u2013 Eileen Gray, Irish furniture designer (b. 1878)"]}, {"page": "1878", "response": ["* August 9 \u2013 Eileen Gray, Irish architect, furniture designer (d. 1976)"]}, {"page": "Alanis Morissette", "response": ["In 2014, Morissette played the role of Marisa Damia, the lover of architect and designer Eileen Gray, in the film The Price of Desire, directed by Mary McGuckian."]}, {"page": "List of Irish people", "response": ["* Eileen Gray"]}, {"page": "Marie-Louise Damien", "response": ["==Eileen Gray==", "Around 1922, Damia became the lover of the architect Eileen Gray, who was a member of a circle of lesbians which included Fuller and her lover Gab Sor\u00e8re, Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks.
