Tommy McLean would also bring in Emanuel Omoyimni, Wayne Gill and \u00d3scar Valles \u2013 all on loan or short term deals \u2013 but none would make an impact on the first team."]}, {"page": "Adam Yates (footballer)", "response": ["Yates graduated through the ranks of the Crewe Alexandra youth system to become a professional in 2002, and spent five months on loan with Conference club Halifax Town from November to April of the 2003\u201304 season. He made his senior debut on 14 November, in a 2\u20132 draw at Burton Albion. Forced to compete with Darren Hockenhull for the right-back position at The Shay, Yates said that \"It was a lot more competitive than the reserve team games I had been playing at Crewe\". He was sent off for his part in a Boxing Day \"mass brawl\" during a 1\u20130 home victory over Scarborough; teammate James Dudgeon and opposition players Matt Redmile and Wayne Gill were also dismissed. He played a total of 13 games for Halifax. After being released by \"Railwaymen\" manager Dario Gradi in May 2004, never having made the first team at Gresty Road, he signed for Leek Town."]}]}}
