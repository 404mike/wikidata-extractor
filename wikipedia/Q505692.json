He was the vocalist of the post-punk goth rock band Bauhaus. After Bauhaus disbanded, Murphy formed Dali's Car with Japan's member Mick Karn and released one album The Waking Hour. He later went on to release a number of solo albums, including Should the World Fail to Fall Apart and Love Hysteria. In 1990, he achieved mainstream success with his hit single \"Cuts You Up\", which topped the American Modern Rock Tracks for 7 weeks. His album Deep also reached #44 on the Billboard 200. In 1992, Murphy released Holy Smoke which reached #108 in the Billboard 200 chart along with his lead single The Sweetest Drop, which peaked #2 in the American Modern Rock Tracks. In 2002, Murphy released Dust with Turkish-Canadian composer and producer Mercan Dede, which utilizes traditional Turkish instrumentation and songwriting, abandoning Murphy's previous pop and rock incarnations, and juxtaposing elements from progressive rock, trance, classical music, and Middle Eastern music, coupled with Dede's trademark atmospheric electronics. In 2014, he released Lion, produced by Killing Joke's Youth, which reached #173 in the Billboard 200.\nThin with prominent cheekbones, a baritone voice, and a penchant for gloomy poetics, he is often called the \"Godfather of Goth\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Goth subculture", "response": ["Notable examples of goth icons include several bandleaders: Siouxsie Sioux, of Siouxsie and the Banshees; Robert Smith, of the Cure; Peter Murphy, of Bauhaus; Rozz Williams, of Christian Death; Olli Wisdom, leader of the band Specimen and keyboardist Jonathan Melton aka Jonny Slut, who evolved the Batcave style.Harriman, Andi; Bontje, Marloes: Some Wear Leather, Some Wear Lace.

The group consists of Daniel Ash (guitar, saxophone), Peter Murphy (vocals, occasional instruments), Kevin Haskins (drums) and David J (bass). The band was originally named Bauhaus 1919 in reference to the first operating year of the German art school Bauhaus, although they shortened the name within a year of formation. One of the pioneers of gothic rock, Bauhaus were known for their dark image and gloomy sound, although they mixed many genres, including dub, glam rock, psychedelia, and funk. ", "Daniel Ash, his friend David J. Haskins, and Haskins' younger brother Kevin, had played together in various bands since childhood. Ash initially tried to convince his school friend Peter Murphy to be in a band, but nothing came out of it. According to Ash: \"Pete didn\u2019t think about it at all, it wasn\u2019t on his mind as such.\" One of the longer-lived of these was a band called the Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought he had the right look for a band. Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided to give it a try, despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song \"In the Flat Field\".", "In terms of early influences from childhood, David J said that he was interested in jazz and its musicians such as Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk. Peter Murphy cited Doris Day, Simon and Garfunkel, The Beatles, The Everly Brothers and his experiences from Mass in Catholic school as highly influential to his singing. When Daniel Ash was asked about how he developed his playing style and guitar influences, he replied: \"My style of playing comes from a mixture of extreme laziness to learn proper scales/chords and a burning desire to sound original and new. Although I am a huge fan of Hendrix and Mick Ronson, Robert Fripp on Bowie tracks is also fab, and what about Earl Slick!\"", "Bauhaus are frequently considered to be the inventors of goth; however the band rejected this label, preferring to describe their style as \"dark glam.\" Peter Murphy said he felt their contemporaries had a larger hand in solidifying what became goth.{{cite web [first=Julian |last=Marszalek|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06637-peter-murphy-bauhaus-interview |title=Peter Murphy Interviewed|website=The Quietus|date=26 July 2011 |access-date=27 November 2015|quote=We were more aligned to The Clash than anything else that was going around. The Cure and those people really solidified what became goth, I suppose.}} Likewise, Kevin Haskins felt that bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees were more influential to goth subculture than themselves and mentioned that Bauhaus were \"...more three dimensional, more art rock\". Ash nevertheless admitted: \"if you wear black and your first single is \"Bela Lugosi\u2019s Dead,\" you\u2019ve pretty much got a stamp on you. That\u2019s always been one of our strongest songs, so it\u2019s sort of undeniable\".", "Bauhaus's fanbase extends beyond music; the American novelist Chuck Palahniuk was influenced by the Bauhaus song \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\" when writing his 2005 novel Haunted. In James O'Barr's 1989 comic book The Crow, the facial features of Eric Draven were based on those of Peter Murphy. In Neil Gaiman's series The Sandman, Dream's face and appearance were also based on Murphy.

The Cure's leader Robert Smith has cited Desertshore as one of his favourite records, as has Bj\u00f6rk. Joy Division's Peter Hook cited Chelsea Girl as one of his favourite albums. Bauhaus' singer, Peter Murphy, considered that \"Nico recorded the first truly Gothic album, Marble lndex or The End. Nico was Gothic, but she was Mary Shelley to everyone else's Hammer Horror. They both did Frankenstein, but Nico's was real.\" Morrissey cited Nico when asked to name artists who had a lasting influence on him: \"The royal three remain the same: the New York Dolls, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, with Nico standing firm as first reserve.\" Morrissey also said of the song \"Innocent and Vain\": \"this is my youth in one piece of music\". Elliott Smith covered \"Chelsea Girls\" and \"These Days\" in Portland, Oregon in October 1999; he also cited The Marble Index as one of his perfect 2.45am albums.

The band's first single from 1983, \"Quiet in Heaven/Song of Liberty\", was labelled as a \"solid post-punk/pre-goth single.\" These elements endured during their tenure with Chucky Mosley, with AllMusic comparing their first album to early Public Image Ltd works, and Mosley's vocals drawing comparisons to Bauhaus lead singer Peter Murphy and H.R. of Bad Brains. By the mid-1980s, Billy Gould stated the band were in a \"weird spot\", as their eclectic sound didn't fit in with the burgeoning hardcore punk and alternative rock movements of the era. Upon Mike Patton's arrival in 1989, the band began to expand their sound range even further, merging disparate genres such as synth-pop, thrash metal, and carousel music on The Real Thing. Rolling Stone states that by 1997, the band were \"too heavy for the post-grunge pop hits of The Verve and Third Eye Blind [and] too arty to work comfortably with the nu metal knuckle-draggers they spawned.\" Over the course of their career, they have experimented with heavy metal, funk, hip hop, progressive rock, alternative rock, hardcore punk, polka, country, easy listening, jazz, samba, ska, bossa nova, hard rock, pop, soul, trip hop, gospel, and lounge music."]}, {"page": "Trent Reznor", "response": ["Reznor possesses a baritone vocal range.

But the journal entries of a horny, sad guy who doesn't fit in ... the words I was writing in my journal to keep myself from going crazy were the real lyrics I needed.\" Another early influence was synth-pop musician Gary Numan, which is evident as Reznor once said that \"after hearing [the 1979 song] \"Cars\" [he] knew [he] wanted to make music with synthesizers\". This was exemplified years later on his single \"Only\" of 2005, whose disco-style beats and synthesizers draw from Numan's persuasion. He mentioned that college radio introduced him to bands such as Bauhaus (whose lead singer, Peter Murphy is regarded by Reznor as \"a hero of mine\"), Joy Division and Throbbing Gristle, which were very inspirational for him.
