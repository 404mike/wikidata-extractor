He was a left-handed batsman.\nHe was born at Warnford, near Droxford in Hampshire and is first recorded as a cricketer in 1773, even though he was by then 32 years of age. As Arthur Haygarth writes, \"he must have played several years previously, the records being unfortunately lost\". Aylward is known to have played in 107 first-class matches from 1773 until 1797. He continued playing after that in minor matches.\nAylward is remembered for his remarkable feat on 18\u201320 June 1777, when he scored 167 runs in one innings against the best bowlers and fielders of the day. This score set a record for the highest individual innings in first-class cricket, beating the 136 scored by John Small in 1775 and standing for 43 years until it was beaten by William Ward in 1820.\nAylward played for Hambledon until 1779 when he was offered employment as a water bailiff by Sir Horatio Mann, and moved to Mann's house at Bourne Paddock in Kent and played for his patron's teams. Latterly he resided in London and died in Edward Street, Marylebone. He is buried in St John's Wood Churchyard, close to Lord's Cricket Ground.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Nyren", "response": ["1777 was another great year for Hambledon with Hampshire playing All-England six times and winning four of them.Haygarth, pp. 31\u201336.

The other seven players were all Hambledon men: John Small, Harry Walker, Tom Walker, Tom Taylor, Noah Mann, Richard Purchase and David Harris.

The main secondary source for the five matches is again S&B which calls the two teams \"Earl of Winchilsea's Side\" and \"Sir Horace (Horatio) Mann's Side\". There is nothing in S&B to suggest that the teams were organised alphabetically. Furthermore, the so-called \"A to M\" teams included Tom Taylor and the \"N to Z\" included James Aylward and William Fennex. CA claims that these were \"given men\" and also that the two patrons evidently alternated between the teams, which would put Winchilsea into \"A to M\" and Mann into \"N to Z\".

Hambledon scored heavily in their second innings; in addition to Small's century, Richard Nyren scored 97 runs and Thomas Brett scored 69. Hambledon won the match by 273 runs. This match is retrospectively considered to be of first-cricket standard, and is considered to be the first century scored in first-class cricket. Two years later, in a match in which both previous record holders were also playing, James Aylward scored 167 runs for Hambledon (again playing as Hampshire) against an \"All England\" side. Minshull made the next highest individual score in the match, remaining 60 not out in All England's first innings, but Aylward's score, along with six scores of between 20 and 50 from his teammates, helped Hambledon to victory by an innings and 168 runs."]}]}}
