For the government of William Pitt their trials in November for treason proved an acute embarrassment. Juries were not ready to accept mere expression of political opinion as evidence of plots against King and Parliament.

Horne Tooke jeered at the Attorney-General and clowned in the dock. His jury took only eight minutes to settle on acquittal.
