It is the only match in English football history to have been abandoned due to a shortage of players. Going into the match, United were comfortably mid-table with neither promotion or relegation possible, while Albion were fighting for promotion to the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The two clubs were not historically seen as rivals, and the fixture was not a local derby, but there was history between United midfielder Georges Santos and Albion midfielder Andy Johnson due to an injury Santos suffered from a collision with Johnson in a previous meeting.", "In a First Division fixture on 10 March 2001 between United and Nottingham Forest, United midfielder Georges Santos was substituted off early in the match, with what was believed to be a concussion. Warnock revealed his disappointment that the referee took no action against Forest midfielder Andy Johnson, who had caused the injury. Santos underwent a five-and-a-half-hour operation on a double fracture of his eye socket, and spoke with his lawyers about the possibility of taking legal action. Johnson defended himself, saying he was \"totally blameless\", as it was Santos who was late in the challenge, but Warnock accused him of lying. Later in the year, Johnson moved to Albion.", "Nine minutes into the match, United goalkeeper Simon Tracey was sent off by referee Eddie Wolstenholme for deliberately handling the ball outside the penalty area and denying Albion an obvious goalscoring opportunity. Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock sent on the substitute keeper, Wilko de Vogt, in place of striker Peter Ndlovu. Albion defender L\u00e1rus Sigur\u00f0sson received a yellow card shortly after. Albion opened the scoring in the 18th minute, when striker Scott Dobie headed in a cross from Andy Johnson.", "|CM ||10 || Andy Johnson || || "]}, {"page": "Andrew Johnson (footballer, born 1981)", "response": ["In June 2012, Johnson signed for Queens Park Rangers on a two-year contract.
