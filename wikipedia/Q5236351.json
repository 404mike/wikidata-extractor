Thank goodness Boycott was fit again, it was seriously said, as his bowling might well be useful!p137, Swanton", "The retirement of England's great new-ball partnership of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham left a yawning gap in the England attack. The fast bowler John Snow would take 31 wickets (22.83) in the 1970\u201371 Ashes series, but he was not chosen for the tour and went to South Africa to play club cricket. Brown was 6'4\" tall and was noted for his steep bounce and was regarded as England's best new ball bowler, his 5/63 forced Australia to follow on in the Third Test at Sydney. The Scottish seamer David Larter was even taller at 6'\u00a07\" and had a ridiculously long run, but he lacked self-confidence, and an ankle injury on the tour ended his career. Jeff Jones was a Welsh left-arm bowler of genuine pace and the father of Simon Jones he took 6/118 in the Fourth Test, but troubled the umpires by running on the pitch and was not really of Test class. Ken Higgs revived his career in 1965 as Brian Statham's new ball partner for Lancashire and took 4/47 and 4/96 against the powerful South African batting at the Oval in 1965. Due to stomach cramps he was not used much in Australia, but took 17 wickets (9.23) in New Zealand, then 24 wickets (25.45) back home against the West Indies. With England's bowlers laid low, the all-rounder Barry Knight was called up. A veteran of the 1962\u201363 Ashes series, he liked to drop the ball short, but lacked the pace to worry the Australians. Even so, he took 4/84 in the Second Test when the hosts were out for 358 on a flat wicket. Geoff Boycott was a useful medium-paced bowler in his youth, known to wear his cap backwards as he bowled, and was used as the third new ball bowler in the Third and Fourth Tests. David Allen and Fred Titmus returned after their successful tour in 1962\u201363, but were only useful on the famous spinning wicket at Sydney, taking 4/47 and 4/40 in the second innings of England's victory. Elsewhere they were expensive and could only be used for containment.

Bobby Simpson had just returned to New South Wales, but they had hired the formidable Tony Lock after the MCC declined to bring him on tour and this was his debut. Lock was the famous Surrey spin twin of Jim Laker, a Slow Left Arm Bowler and the best close fielder in England. He played for Western Australia until 1970-71 and was their captain from 1963\u201364, winning them the Sheffield Shield in 1967-68. Ted Dexter won the toss and elected to bat, but though he made 76 in 113 minutes with 2 sixes and 10 fours the other batsmen struggled as the MCC slumped to 161/7 with Des Hoare taking 4/92. They were rescued by the all-rounder Fred Titmus (88) and wicket-keeper Alan Smith (42), who added 119 in 130 minutes. This was the first eighth-wicket century partnership in WA-MCC matches and a record, but Lock (4/68) took the last four wickets and the innings closed on 303 at stumps.

Colin Cowdrey was twice missed off Garth McKenzie in the first over and Geoff Pullar was dropped by the normally safe hands of Tony Lock, but they reached 49/0 for a ten wicket win. 12,200 showed up over the three days play, probably lessened by the forthcoming Combined XI match and Commonwealth Games.pp. 2-4, Moyes and Goodman", "In olden days the twin poles of Australian cricket - Melbourne and Sydney - each hosted two Tests in a season, but now that Brisbane received a Test they took it in turns to host the extra Test and the Australian XI game.

Harvey must have had bitter memories of the match four years before which cost him the Australian captaincy; Peter May made 140 and 114, Laker and Lock took 12 wickets and the MCC won by 345 runs. Ted Dexter won the toss and after the loss of Geoff Pullar at 35/1 Dexter marched out and thrashed 102 off 110 minutes, hitting 2 sixes and 13 fours, and the hands of the fielders were left bruised and burning. \"There was a drive off Vievers which sent the ball soaring over the sightboard\".pp19-24, Moyes and Goodman John Woodcock  of The Times wrote \"I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today.

Dexter carried on the innings for most of the next day, seeing Barrington make his first first-class double century (219 not out) and Knight 108, adding 209 for the sixth-wicket. He finally declared 40 minutes for tea for 633/7, had he waited any longer tea would have been taken early, but lost the advantage due to rain. It was the highest score by the MCC or England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the highest by the MCC since Douglas Jardine and company racked up 634/9 against South Australia back in 1932-33. The best bowler was Bobby Simpson who took 3/153 and now made 130 in response, adding 72 for the first-wicket with Thomas (27), 100 for the second with Harvey (51) and 67 for the third with Shepherd (114). Shepherd and McLachlan (55) added another 115 for the fourth-wicket, but David Larter (3/80) took three quick wickets and the Australian XI fell from 415/5 to 451 all out on the fourth and final day. Dexter was 182 runs ahead and could have enforced the follow on, but decided to give his bowlers a rest and batted again, but not very well. Colin Guest took 3/22 in some compensence for his first innings hammering and Dexter declared on 68/5, leaving the Australians 160 minutes to make 251 runs to win. They reached 201/4 thanks mainly to 91 not out from Shepherd and 68 from McLachlan. Dexter had used negative field placings throughout the match, which rather killed the sporting declaration, and the game died on its feet.p. 121, Swanton", "After rain delayed the start until 3 o'clock Ken Mackay won the toss and batted regardless of the convention that rain livens up the pitch at Brisbane, but Fred Trueman had backache and Brian Statham was being rested and the MCC bowling attack lacked bite. David Larter sent the ball flying over the batsmen's heads, but he scatter the ball all over the place. Len Coldwell dug the ball in as well and had a good slower ball, but failed to get the ball to swing. Peter Parfitt removed Des Ball with a diving catch at 10/1, but the rest of the day saw la number of missed chances and Queensland reached 123/2 by the end of the day. Sam Trimble crawled to 95 in six hours, a dismal innings which Johnny Moyes thought \"lacked so much in batsmanship that it did not deserve to go down in the records\".p36, Moyes and Goodman Nevertheless, with Tom Veivers (36), Peter Burge (34) and Graham Bizzell (59) he took the score to 259/5. Even \"Slasher\" Mackay looked good after this and the dour Queenslander started driving the ball through the covers, adding 85 with Des Hughson (26) and 88 with wicket-keeper Wally Grout who hit a swashbuckling 56 with 2 sixes and 6 fours. Mackay made 105 not out, the first century for Queensland vs the MCC since 1950-51 and their 433/7 declared was their highest score against them since the war. Geoff Pullar had the flu and Colin Cowdrey was also resting, so Peter Parfitt opened with David Sheppard saw the tourists through to stumps then took their stand to 101 the next day. Queensland's overseas player was the West Indian fast bowler Wes Hall and earlier on the Monday one of his bouncers rose awkwardly and broke Grout's jaw, he was hurried to hospital and missed the First Test as a result. Hall (0/106) was overbowled on the now flat Woolloongabba wicket and Queensland's best bowler was the leg-spinner Colin Westaway (3/156), which pretty much sums up the innings as the MCC piled up 581/6. Peter Parfitt made a subdued 47 and David Sheppard was dropped on 51, 77 and 83 before Mackay bowled him for 94. Ted Dexter powered his way to 80 in 85 minutes with a 6 and 13 fours, adding 110 with Sheppard. The insatiable Ken Barrington amassed 183 not out with 22 boundaries, including some superb drives, pulls and cuts, adding 103 with Tom Graveney (52) and 180 with the all rounder Barry Knight, who hit 2 sixes and 11 fours in his 81. Alan Smith came in at 512/6, but when he reached 22 he ducked into a Wes Hall bouncer that stayed low and became the second wicket-keeping casualty of the match. The Duke of Norfolk and the team physiotherapist Sam Cowan helped him off the field and took him to hospital, where to everyone's relief x-rays found that he had not fractured his skull. Dexter declared for 581/6 and John Murray came on as a substitute keeper. Queensland only had to bat out the afternoon, but Mackay re-arranged the batting order and they promptly collapsed to Dexter's medium-paced swing (4/8) and the part-time leg-spin of Tom Graveney (2/2). Mackay came in for the penultimate ball with the score on at 94/7 and was missed in the slips. With Grout unable to bat had Mackay been out the MCC would have needed to take Westaway's wicket with the last ball of the match for a surprise win in an otherwise dull game.pp. 35-39, Moyes and Goodmanp. 122, Swanton", "The Duke of Norfolk left the touring party after the First Test in order to prepare Sir Winston Churchill's funeral (the statesman was 87 and was given a state funeral when he died in 1965).

By the end of the first day the MCC were 258/3 with Peter Parfitt hitting 98 in 72 minutes, winning prizes for the fastest 50 in the match and the first six to be hit. Ted Dexter, the main draw in the side, played carefully so as to be in for the Saturday, but was caught on the fence for 2. Tom Graveney made 118, David Sheppard 67, Ray Illingworth 58 and Dexter declared on 423/9 the next day. David Allen (5/57) bowled out the locals for 138 for an innings win, even though Brown made 47, having batted for 7 hours in three innings against the MCC and being hit for 21 runs off an over by the Darling Downs batsman Don Bickel, who was awarded a trophy for his 44 in 38 minutes.p22, Ian Ferguson, Cricket Fever Grips the Bush, Ashes Ablaze, Newspress Pty Ltd, 1986pp. 61-62, Moyes and Goodman", "From Townsville, Queensland to Bendigo, Victoria is 1,800 miles and the MCC played the second of three consecutive upcountry games.

Colin Cowdrey was in charge and by the end of the day he was 95 not out, having seen Barrington out for 90 as the MCC more than doubled the local score with a tally of 225/4. He reached his century (111) the next day and Tom Graveney made 59 not out before he declared on 360/8 after the Country XI used 9 bowlers.

Johnny Moyes had a solution - two Dexters! He won the toss and batted on the flat wicket at the Adelaide Oval, still roped into a 75-yard circle. Peter Parfitt was a makeshift opener again as Geoff Pullar was recovering from a groin strain and was bowled for 2 and the 19-year-old Ian Chappell dropped David Sheppard in the slips before he had scored. Dexter hit three scorching boundaries before Chappell caught him off a full-blooded cut off Gary Sobers. As the England captain stalked off  he turned to Chappell and said \"You have a habit of getting in the way, young man\". The MCC were now 39/2, but Cowdrey came in and made the highest score of his career. On Christmas Eve (his birthday) he made 307 to beat Frank Woolley's 305 not out against Tasmania in 1911-12 as the highest score by a tourist in Australia. It was the first triple century made in Australia since Don Bradman made 357 and 369 and Jack Badcock 325 in 1935-36. Cowdrey added 103 runs with Sheppard (81), 98 with Ken Barrington then stroked 344 runs with fellow stylist Tom Graveney (122 not out), he hit 4 sixes and 29 fours and when he was out after 389 minutes Dexter declared the innings closed on 586/5. The South Australian captain Les Favell was always a cheery soul and he set about matching this huge total with some brilliant batting. Favell made 120 of the first 165 runs and John Lill (55), Gary Sobers (89), Ian McLachlan (62) and Neil Dansie (64) amassed 425/6, but Ian Chappell was run out by Ken Barrington for 2 and the last four wickets fell for 25 runs. Dexter turned to his spinners during the long innings and Fred Titmus (3/88), David Allen (2/54) and Ken Barrington (3/56) bowled 60 overs between them. Favell's century was the first by a South Australian batsman against the MCC for 16 years and the 128 run partnership between Sobers and McLachlan was a state record against the MCC for the fourth-wicket, beating the 126 made by George Giffen and John Reedman back in 1894-95. David Larter was hit for 0/113 off 22 overs, which pretty much finished his chances of playing in the Test series. South Australia's 450 ended an hour short of stumps, but Peter Parfitt was caught for 7 behind off Gordon Brooks and Gary Sobers bowled David Sheppard for 5. Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey appealed for light, which was refused and took the MCC to 22/2 when bad light finally stopped play at 25 minutes to six. Cowdrey was out for 2 first thing next morning and Dexter (37) smashed a six onto the roof of the stands, the biggest hit anyone could remember at the Adelaide Oval. Barrington made 52 not out and Dexter declared on 167/6, leaving the hosts 304 to win in 140 minutes. Favell took up the challenge, but was out for 3, soon followed by Lill for 2.

Though in sight of victory the hosts collapsed once Vernon was bowled for 118 by Jones (2/39), Kelly was left stranded on 108 not out, the first Western Australian to make two centuries in a match against the MCC, with no other batsman making more than 11. Western Australia were out for 291 to give the MCC a thrilling 9 run win in the last minute. \"That's the last time I take the ruddy manager's advice on a declaration\" joked Smith.p132, Swantonpp23-33, John Clarke, With England in Australia, Stanley Paul, 1966", "M.J.K.

Captain Les Favell (9) and Lynn Marks (30) added 25 for the first wicket, after which six wickets fell in nine overs as David Larter (3/29), Dave Brown (3/35) and Dave Allen (4/24) bowled them out for 103. Geoff Boycott (94) and John Edrich (61) passed this with an opening stand of 116 in 83 minutes. Boycott had been ill and this was his first innings in Australia, hitting his first ball for four.p45, Clarke After they were out only Ken Barrington (69) made any runs as Neil Hawke (3/71) and David Sincock (5/113) took control, and the MCC were out for 310. Les Favell (96) and Marks (67) gave South Australia a better start with 150 for the first wicket, the wicketkeeper Barry Jarman made 61 and Alan Shiell 83 in a total of 364.

Benaud captained the team and fulfilled 90% of his duties by winning the toss and choosing to bat. Thanks to Burke (79), Sheahan (60), Benaud (45) and Stackpole (32 not out) the Prime Minister's XI hit 288/7 in 35 overs, with the wickets shared amongst the touring bowlers with Jeff Jones taking 2/21, David Larter 2/43 and Bob Barber 2/72. The declaration came halfway through the day and the MCC's winning 289/8 also took 35 overs, though they passed 200 for the loss of two wickets as Geoff Boycott made 95 before he was run out, Colin Cowdrey 52 and M.J.K. Smith 51 not out. Eight bowlers were used, but the best was Jim Burke who took 2/5 with his infamous chucking action, dismissing John Murray and Jones for ducks in the closing minutes of the match.", "David Larter (3/31) had the South Australian Country XI 6/1, but their opener Broadbridge went on to make made 36. Their best batsmen were Fischer (40 not out) and Parson (37 not out) who had added 76 for the seventh wicket when their captain declared. Thanks to Geoff Boycott (99) the MCC made these runs easily, he added 82 for the first wicket with John Edrich (45) and 90 for the second with Peter Parfitt (56 not out), who remained with captain Colin Cowdrey (19 not out) for some batting practice after the 8 wicket victory."]}, {"page": "Larter", "response": ["*David Larter (born 1940), Scottish cricketer"]}, {"page": "Jack Manning (cricketer)", "response": ["Tribe retired at the end of the 1959 season and the balance of the Northamptonshire bowling attack shifted dramatically in 1960 as the team fell to the bottom of the table after more than a month without a single victory.
