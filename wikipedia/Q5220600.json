On 9 February, he scored a brace in a 3\u20132 win at Morecambe to earn himself a place on the EFL team of the week for the third time that season.

In preparation for the 2016\u201317 campaign, Flitcroft released six players and brought in a number of new signings, including: Antony Kay, Greg Leigh, Leon Barnett, Neil Danns, Paul Rachubka, Chris Brown and James Vaughan. Flitcroft was named as League One Manager of the Month for September 2016 after overseeing five wins from five games that the League Managers Association described as \"guided by Flitcroft\u2019s beliefs in attacking play and some shrewd moves at the end of the transfer window\". On 16 November, Flitcroft was sacked after a run of 11 games without a win that coincided with a series of injuries to first-team players such as Tom Pope, Danny Mayor and Nathan Cameron. Gareth Southgate's promotion to England manager left a vacancy for the head coach role of the under-21 team and Flitcroft applied for the position, making into the final four of the interview process, though the job instead went to Aidy Boothroyd."]}, {"page": "Balshaw's Church of England High School", "response": ["* Danny Mayor, footballer"]}]}}
