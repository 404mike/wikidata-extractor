He joined Linklaters in 1969, progressed to Partner in 1974, and Head of Real Estate from 1997 to 1999.  Linklaters' most Senior Partner, he left the firm on 1 July 2005 to become Chairman of property developer Liberty International, overseeing its transition to a REIT when the status was first introduced.\nHe was Alderman for the City Ward of Coleman Street, having first been elected to represent Coleman Street in 1992.  He became a Sheriff in 1999, Master of the Solicitors' Company in 2000, and Lord Mayor of London in 2003.\n\nIn 2008, following a change to the voting system to the Court of Aldermen, he was successfully challenged by a previously  unheard-of young lawyer, Matthew Richardson (now Alderman), in a close-fought campaign.  Finch admitted to having overspent on the campaign, by not declaring the use of Liberty's company car and chauffeur.  When challenged, in Finch and another v Richardson (2008), a judge ruled that ignorance of the law could constitute by virtue of inadvertence a defence in electoral law: a point that hitherto existed in Scots law and Northern Ireland law, but not in English law.Finch was appointed Knight Bachelor in 2004 for \"services to the City of London\".He died on 31 March 2016 at the age of 71 after a short illness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paternoster Square", "response": ["Rebuilding was carried out between 1961\u20137, but it involved only part of Holford's concept \u2014 the area of Paternoster Square between St Paul's churchyard and Newgate Street \u2014 and this included undistinguished buildings by other architects and the omission of some of Holford's features. The new Paternoster Square soon became very unpopular, and (in the eyes of many) its grim presence immediately north of one of the capital's prime tourist attractions was seen as an embarrassment. Robert Finch, the Lord Mayor of London, wrote of it in The Guardian in 2004, that it was made up of \"ghastly, monolithic constructions without definition or character\"."]}, {"page": "Linklaters", "response": ["* Robert Finch (Lord Mayor), Lord Mayor of the City of London was a partner at Linklaters"]}, {"page": "List of lord mayors of London", "response": ["| 2003 || Sir Robert Finch || Solicitor||"]}, {"page": "Sir Robert Finch (Lord Mayor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Finch (Lord Mayor)"]}, {"page": "Robert Finch", "response": ["Robert Finch may refer to: ", "* Robert Finch (American politician) (1925\u20131995), Republican politician from California", "* Robert Finch (antiquarian) (1783\u20131830), English antiquary", "* Robert Finch (Lord Mayor) (1944\u20132016), British politician and lawyer", "* Robert Finch (nature writer) (born 1943), American nature writer and essayist", "* Robert Finch (poet) (1900\u20131995), Canadian poet and academic", "* Robert Finch (priest) (1724\u20131803), English divine", "* Robert Finch (rugby league) (born 1955), Australian rugby league player"]}, {"page": "List of Old Felstedians", "response": ["* Sir Robert Finch (b. 1944), Lord Mayor of London 2003 (Who's Who)"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Sir Robert Finch, 71, Lord Mayor of London (2003)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2016", "response": ["*Sir Robert Finch, 71, British businessman, Lord Mayor of London (2003).Finch"]}]}}
