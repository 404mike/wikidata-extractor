Sandler, Hanna Segal, J. D. Sutherland and Donald Winnicott.", "Psychoanalytic theory has, from its inception, been the subject of criticism and controversy. Freud remarked on this early in his career, when other physicians in Vienna ostracized him for his findings that hysterical conversion symptoms were not limited to women. Challenges to analytic theory began with Otto Rank and Alfred Adler (turn of the 20th century), continued with behaviorists (e.g. Wolpe) into the 1940s and '50s, and have persisted (e.g. Miller). Criticisms come from those who object to the notion that there are mechanisms, thoughts or feelings in the mind that could be unconscious. Criticisms also have been leveled against the idea of \"infantile sexuality\" (the recognition that children between ages two and six imagine things about procreation). Criticisms of theory have led to variations in analytic theories, such as the work of Ronald Fairbairn, Michael Balint, and John Bowlby. In the past 30 years or so, the criticisms have centered on the issue of empirical verification."]}, {"page": "Otto Rank", "response": ["Foreshadowing the central themes of Piaget, Kohlberg, McClelland, Erikson and Robert Kegan, Rank was the first to propose that human development is a lifelong construction, which requires continual negotiation and renegotiation of the dual yearnings for individuation and connection, the will to separate and the will to unite. Decades before Ronald Fairbairn, now credited by many as the inventor in the 1940s of modern object-relations theory, Rank's 1926 lecture on \"The Genesis of the Object Relation\" marks the first complete statement of this theory (Rank, 1996, pp.\u00a0140\u2013149). By 1926 Rank was persona non grata in the official psychoanalytic world. There is little reason to believe, therefore, that any of the other writers credited with helping to invent object relations theory (Melanie Klein or Donald Winnicott, for example) ever read the German text of this lecture, published as Zur Genese der Object-beziehung in Vol. 1 of Rank's Genetische Psychologie (1927, pp.\u00a0110\u201322)."]}, {"page": "Stockholm syndrome", "response": ["== Ronald Fairbairn's object relations theory of attachment to the abuser ==", "Ronald Fairbairn wrote a complete psychoanalytic model in a series of papers (1940, 1941, 1943, 1944) \u00a0which are collected in his 1952 text Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality.\u00a0His model explains the surprising psychological reality that abused children become deeply attached to their abusers. He saw that lack of love, chronic indifference and abuse led to a counter-intuitive emotional attachment to the very parent who was abusing them. \u00a0The child's unmet dependency needs from chronic emotional deprivation, as well as the complete lack of other human alternatives in their environment, leaves the child stuck at an earlier emotional age, as they have not been able to continue their developmental progress in the absence of parental help and support. Thus the child may be 12, but emotionally and developmentally they may experience the world like a six-year-old, as their increasingly developmental needs force them to focus on the abuser, waiting for any hint of developmental support. The child becomes concerned for the abuser's welfare because their developmental progress hinges upon on the whims, moods and\u00a0emotional state of the abusive parent. In addition to the pressure from unmet developmental needs, the child is also aware of the potential danger that can emerge from the volatile and aggressive parent, and anything that they can do to placate, please or draw praise from the abuser increases their chance of survival."]}, {"page": "Schizoid personality disorder", "response": ["The second path, that of dynamic psychiatry, began in 1924 with observations by Eugen Bleuler,Eugen Bleuler \u2013 Textbook of Psychiatry, New York: Macmillan (1924) who observed that the schizoid person and schizoid pathology were not things to be set apart.
