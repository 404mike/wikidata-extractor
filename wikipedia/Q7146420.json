He was also Co-Director of Democratic Audit and Chair of the LSE Public Policy Group. In addition Dunleavy is an ANZSOG Institute for Governance Centenary Chair at the University of Canberra, Australia.As an undergraduate Patrick Dunleavy studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, graduating in 1973. He moved to Nuffield College, Oxford to work on his doctoral thesis which was published in 1981 as The Politics of Mass Housing in Britain, 1945-75: Study of Corporate Power and Professional Influence in the Welfare State.Dunleavy is a prominent political theorist specialising in the fields of public policy and government. His research has focused on the concepts of sectors and sectoral conflicts, rational choice theories of politics, the bureau-shaping model of bureaucracy, and the claimed contemporary public management paradigm of digital era governance.  Dunleavy is a frequent blogger on the LSE's British Politics and Policy site and has had an active Twitter account since 2010 commentating predominately on British politics. He is also former joint editor-in-chief of the academic journal Global Policy.Dunleavy is also the author of advice texts for humanities and social sciences students, most notably his book Authoring a PhD: How to plan, draft, write and finish a doctoral dissertation or thesis (2003).\nIn June 2014 Dunleavy examined how costly it would be to set up an independent Scottish state in the report Transitioning to a New Scottish State written with Sean Kippin and Joel Suss and commissioned by The Sunday Post. Both the Yes and No camps in the independence debate claimed the report to differing extents validated their own arguments and figures. Dunleavy has since declared publicly that the Scottish Treasury \"badly misrepresents\" his research.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 21", "response": ["*  1952   \u2013 Patrick Dunleavy, English political scientist and academic"]}, {"page": "Philip Cowley", "response": ["*Developments in British Politics 8, Macmillan, 2006 (ed.

It argues that rational officials will not want to maximize their budgets, but instead to shape their agency so as to maximize their personal utilities from their work. For instance, bureaucrats would prefer to work in small, elite agencies close to political power centres and doing interesting work, rather than to run large-budget agencies with many staff but also many risks and problems. For the same reasons, and to avoid risks, the bureau-shaping model also predicts that senior government bureaucrats will often favour either 'agencification' to other public sector bodies by having policy determination and advice separated from the implementation of the legislated practices of government (as in the UK 'Next Steps' programme, Australian Department - Agency system) or off-loading functions to contractors and privatization. In the health and social work fields, officials will favour 'deinstitutionalization' and 'care in the community'. The model was developed by Patrick Dunleavy from the London School of Economics in Democracy, Bureaucracy and Public Choice (London:  Pearson Education, 1991, reissued 2001).", "It was propounded in response to William Niskanen's harsh criticism of Public Bureaucracies in his Budget Maximising Model. The Niskanen model predicts that in representative democracies, public bureaucracies will not only generate allocative inefficiency (by oversupplying public goods) but also x-inefficiency (by producing public goods inefficiently). Patrick Dunleavy, a British political scientist who set out to demolish the public choice arguments on bureaucracy, came instead in the end to develop a public choice model of bureaucratic behaviour which combines elements of Peacock\u2019s insight with the original American model. The Dunleavy (1985, p.\u00a0300) model of public bureaucracy is built on six basic assumptions.

He also stated it is likely that ideological wars between rival economic world views have returned for good. In September, Steven Rattner opined that the 2012 United States presidential election was shaping up to be a contest between the economic policies of Keynes and Friedrich Hayek, or \"a clash of ideologies the likes of which America has not seen in decades.\" Republican candidates openly praised Hayek and Ludwig von Mises. According to Rattner, while the Democrats economic strategy remained largely based on Keynes, the economist's name was now rarely mentioned; Keynes had become an almost politically toxic word due to the extensive criticism of the 2009 Keynesian stimulus. Rattner refers to the work of Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, which determined that the 2009 United States stimulus saved about 8.5 million jobs, and with Obama's  third stimulus, a $450 billion Jobs plan was projected to create 1.9 million jobs in 2012."]}, {"page": "List of public administration scholars", "response": ["* Patrick Dunleavy"]}, {"page": "Donlevy", "response": ["*Patrick Dunleavy (born 1952), British political scientist"]}, {"page": "2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum", "response": ["Those in favour of AV included Timothy Gowers (Cambridge), David Held (LSE), Patrick Dunleavy (LSE), and Helen Margetts (Oxford), Thom Brooks (Newcastle University), Alastair McMillan (Sheffield), and Ben Saunders (Stirling)."]}, {"page": "R.

The core functions of the British executive are to pull together and integrate central government policies and to act as final arbiters of conflicts between different elements of the government machine. These functions can be carried out by institutions other than prime minister and cabinet; for example, the Treasury and the Cabinet Office.

Both Patrick Dunleavy and Lynsey Hanley agree that architects and planners were influenced by Le Corbusier's promotion of high-rise architecture.
