He joined the North West Company in 1820 and was retained by the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company after the 1821 amalgamation. He began his HBC career at York Factory (Manitoba) and from there, he helped outfit two forts in the south; Lower Fort Garry, and Fort du Bas de la Rivi\u00e8re at the mouth of the Winnipeg River.\nFrom 1826 to 1832, his postings took him to various posts on the Pacific coast and subsequently to Fort Albany. He travelled aboard the Cadboro along the coast of British Columbia identifying Somenos, Quamichan and Penelakut village sites. From there, he founded Fort Concord to extend the company\u2019s trade into the Winisk River area. Next was Martin Falls where he worked for six years; and then transferred to Fort Albany as Chief Trader. His last posting was Norway House where he stayed until he retired to Montreal. During his stay, he outfitted a number of northern expeditions including those of John Rae. He was also arrested a free trader, Andrew Bannatyne in an attempt to protect the HBC monopoly in the area.\nDuring his working life with the HBC, Barnston was a student of the natural history of the various areas and his specimens are in the Smithsonian Institution, the British Museum, and the Redpath Museum at McGill. He wrote regularly for the Canadian Naturalist and often for the Ibis as well. \nHe became a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1882.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barnston Island (British Columbia)", "response": ["Located in the Fraser River between Surrey and Pitt Meadows, Barnston Island was named in 1827 for Hudson's Bay Company Clerk George Barnston.

He found none in the immediate vicinity of the river's mouth and the Cadboro was unable to gain navigable access to the Fraser River for several days until a channel was discovered. Meanwhile, in the smaller boats, and proceeding further up river, McMillan surveyed several potential locations for the new fort on July 27\u201328. It was around this time that McMillan Island was named for him. Other islands named during this survey of the river were Barnston Island (for clerk George Barnston) and Annacis Island (for Clerk Francois Noel Annance). Unfortunately, the Cadboro was unable to weigh anchor close enough to shore to safely unload cargo at the site McMillan had preferred to establish the Fort. The next day it sailed downriver to another spot on the south side of the Fraser, which McMillan had remarked upon earlier. This location was just west of the Salmon River's confluence with the Fraser in an area later to be known as Derby. On Monday July 30, McMillan's party unloaded horses at the site and the laborious clearance of the forest commenced. The first post of the Fort was cut on August 1, 1827. On August 13, the first bastion of the fort\u2014deemed to be the priority as a consequence of rumours of a pending massacre by Indians\u2014was completed."]}, {"page": "James Barnston", "response": ["James Barnston (July 3, 1831 \u2013 May 20, 1858), a son of HBC fur trader George Barnston, was born at Norway House (Man.), and trained as a physician at the University of Edinburgh.
