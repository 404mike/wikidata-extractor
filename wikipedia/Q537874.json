His father, Michele di Francesco Cioni, initially worked as a tile and brick maker, then later as a tax collector. Verrocchio never married, and had to provide financial support for some members of his family. He was at first apprenticed to a goldsmith. It has been suggested that he was later apprenticed to Donatello, but there is no evidence of this and John Pope-Hennessy considered that it is contradicted by the style of his early works. It has been suggested that he was trained as a painter under Fra Filippo Lippi.Syson & Dunkerton p. 378. Little is known about his life. His main works are dated in his last twenty years and his advancement owed much to the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici and his son Piero. His workshop was in Florence where he was a member of the Guild of St Luke. Several great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Lorenzo di Credi passed through his workshop as apprentices. Beyond this, artists like Domenico Ghirlandaio, Francesco Botticini, and Pietro Perugino were also involved and their early works can be hard to distinguish from works by Verrocchio.Passavent p. 45. Giovanni Santi records that Botticelli, Luca Signorelli, and a young Filippino Lippi also visited or worked in Verrocchio's studio.

According to art historians Robert Echols and Frederick Ilchman, the many portraits from Tintoretto's studio that were executed largely by assistants have hampered appreciation of his autograph portraits which, in sharp contrast to his narrative works, are understated and somber. Lawrence Gowing considered Tintoretto's \"smoldering portraits of personalities who seemed consumed by their own fire\" to be his \"most irresistible\" works.Gowing, Lawrence (1987).

These are almost the only paintings of the Roman period that have survived, aside from frescos, though it is known from the writings of Pliny the Elder that portrait painting was well established in Greek times, and practiced by both men and women artists.Cheney, Faxon, and Russo, Self-Portraits by Women Painters, Ashgate Publishing, Hants (England), 2000, p. 7,  In his times, Pliny complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, \"The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out\u2026Indolence has destroyed the arts.\"John Pope-Hennessy, The Portrait in the Renaissance, Bollingen Foundation, New York, 1966, pp. 71\u201372Natural History XXXV:2 trans H. Rackham 1952.  Loeb Classical Library These full-face portraits from Roman Egypt are fortunate exceptions. They present a somewhat realistic sense of proportion and individual detail (though the eyes are generally oversized and the artistic skill varies considerably from artist to artist). The Fayum portraits were painted on wood or ivory in wax and resin colors (encaustic) or with tempera, and inserted into the mummy wrapping, to remain with the body through eternity.", "Many innovations in the various forms of portraiture evolved during this fertile period. The tradition of the portrait miniature began, which remained popular until the age of photography, developing out of the skills of painters of the miniatures in illuminated manuscripts. Profile portraits, inspired by ancient medallions, were particularly popular in Italy between 1450 and 1500. Medals, with their two\u2013sided images, also inspired a short-lived vogue for two-sided paintings early in the Renaissance.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 209 Classical sculpture, such as the Apollo Belvedere, also influenced the choice of poses utilized by Renaissance portraitists, poses that have continued in usage through the centuries.Simon, p. 80 Leonardo's Ginevra de' Benci () is one of the first known three-quarter-view portraits in Italian art.", "Northern European artists led the way in realistic portraits of secular subjects.  The greater realism and detail of the Northern artists during the 15th century was due in part to the finer brush strokes and effects possible with oil colors, while the Italian and Spanish painters were still using tempera.  Among the earliest painters to develop oil technique was Jan van Eyck. Oil colors can produce more texture and grades of thickness, and can be layered more effectively, with the addition of increasingly thick layers one over another (known by painters as \u2018fat over lean\u2019).  Also, oil colors dry more slowly, allowing the artist to make changes readily, such as altering facial details. Antonello da Messina was one of the first Italians to take advantage of oil. Trained in Belgium, he settled in Venice around 1475, and was a major influence on Giovanni Bellini and the Northern Italian school.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 54, 63 During the 16th century, oil as a medium spread in popularity throughout Europe, allowing for more sumptuous renderings of clothing and jewelry.  Also affecting the quality of the images, was the switch from wood to canvas, starting in Italy in the early part of the 16th century and spreading to Northern Europe over the next century. Canvas resists cracking better than wood, holds pigments better, and needs less preparation\u2015but it was initially much scarcer than wood.", "Leading German portrait artists including Lucas Cranach, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and Hans Holbein the Younger who all mastered oil painting technique. Cranach was one of the first artists to paint life-sized full-length commissions, a tradition popular from then on.Piper, p. 363 At that time, England had no portrait painters of the first rank, and artists like Holbein were in demand by English patrons.Aymar, p. 29 His painting of Sir Thomas More (1527), his first important patron in England, has nearly the realism of a photograph.Piper, p. 365 Holbein made his great success painting the royal family, including Henry VIII.  D\u00fcrer was an outstanding draftsman and one of the first major artists to make a sequence of self-portraits, including a full-face painting. He also placed his self-portrait figure (as an onlooker) in several of his religious paintings.Bonafoux, p. 35 D\u00fcrer began making self-portraits at the age of thirteen.John Pope-Hennessy, pp. 124\u2013126 Later, Rembrandt would amplify that tradition.", "In Italy, Masaccio led the way in modernizing the fresco by adopting more realistic perspective. Filippo Lippi paved the way in developing sharper contours and sinuous linesPiper, p. 318 and his pupil Raphael extended realism in Italy to a much higher level in the following decades with his monumental wall paintings.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 20 During this time, the betrothal portrait became popular, a particular specialty of Lorenzo Lotto.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 227  During the early Renaissance, portrait paintings were generally small and sometimes covered with protective lids, hinged or sliding.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 212", "A very high degree of grace in the light and shadow is added to the faces of those who sit in the doorways of rooms that are dark, where the eyes of the observer see the shadowed part of the face obscured by the shadows of the room, and see the lighted part of the face with the greater brilliance which the air gives it. Through this increase in the shadows and the lights, the face is given greater relief.John Pope-Hennessy, pp. 103\u20134", "In Venice around 1500, Gentile Bellini and Giovanni Bellini dominated portrait painting. They received the highest commissions from the leading officials of the state.  Bellini's portrait of Doge Loredan is considered to be one of the finest portraits of the Renaissance and ably demonstrates the artist's mastery of the newly arrived techniques of oil painting.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 52 Bellini is also one of the first artists in Europe to sign their work, though he rarely dated them.Piper, p. 330 Later in the 16th century, Titian assumed much the same role, particularly by expanding the variety of poses and sittings of his royal subjects. Titian was perhaps the first great child portraitist.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 279 After Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese became leading Venetian artists, helping the transition to Italian Mannerism.  The Mannerists contributed many exceptional portraits that emphasized material richness and elegantly complex poses, as in the works of Agnolo Bronzino and Jacopo da Pontormo. Bronzino made his fame portraying the Medici family. His daring portrait of Cosimo I de' Medici, shows the austere ruler in armor with a wary eye gazed to his extreme right, in sharp contrast to most royal paintings which show their sitters as benign sovereigns.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 182 El Greco, who trained in Venice for twelve years, went in a more extreme direction after his arrival in Spain, emphasizing his \"inner vision\" of the sitter to the point of diminishing the reality of physical appearance.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 154  One of the best portraitists of 16th-century Italy was Sofonisba Anguissola from Cremona, who infused her individual and group portraits with new levels of complexity.", "Court portraiture in France began when Flemish artist Jean Clouet painted his opulent likeness of Francis I of France around 1525.John Pope-Hennessy, p. 187 King Francis was a great patron of artists and an avaricious art collector who invited Leonardo da Vinci to live in France during his later years. The Mona Lisa stayed in France after Leonardo died there."]}, {"page": "Giovanni di Paolo", "response": ["Later in his life Giovanni became greatly skilled at painting illuminated manuscripts, he illuminated choir books for the Augustinian monks at Lecceto as well as Dante's Divine Comedy.Keith Christiansen, Laurence B. Kanter and Carl Brandon Strehlke, Painting in Renaissance Siena (New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1988), 168.  The illuminations that he created for Dante's poem are some of his most famous and best preserved works. His illuminations are one area viewers can see how Giovanni di Paolo differentiates himself from other Sienese artists. He may have been in contact with Franco-Flemish illuminators, who had been in Siena during Giovanni's early years. It seems their Northern influence may have rubbed off on Giovanni because his landscapes resemble those in the famous painting by the Limbourg brothers; Tres Riches Heures.Timothy Hyman, Sienese Painting (New York: Thames & Hudson, 2003), 162. His suspected master, Taddeo di Bartolo, probably taught him how to paint with a \"toughness of line\", which can be seen in any of his works.   The most striking quality of Giovanni di Paolo's work is the fantastical quality. John Pope-Hennessy explains Giovanni di Paolo's work eloquently, \"Few experiences in Italian painting are more exciting than to follow Giovanni di Paolo as he plunges, like Alice, through the looking-glass.  If one looks at the Madonna of Humility (1435) the checkerboard landscape confirms the world beyond the garden scene in the foreground (also referred to as the hortus conclusus). This checkerboard panorama effect is used frequently by Giovanni for its ability \"to create an abstraction of space, whose appeal is not to the fixed optic of the spectator, so much as to the winged flight of the dream-voyager.\" ."]}, {"page": "Domenico di Bartolo", "response": ["In regards to sculptor Jacopo della Quercia, Domenico's Madonna of Humility shows hints of adaptation by displaying similarities to Jacopo's Madonna in the Fonte Gaia. Both portray a new kind of gothic flexibility in the draper, which creates soft pockets of shadows that add to a new kind of weightiness to the figure and to the overall image. Domenico's Madonna of Humilityeventually ended up contributing significantly more to Florentine than to Sienese art. During the time that the painting was released to the public, appreciation and recognition from Sienese art critics were minimal. To serve as evidence that there had been some kind of a partnership to exist between Jacopo and Domenico, John Pope-Hennessy's research confirms that the major works of Domenico for the Cathedral of Siena were commissioned at the time when Jacopo was the overseeing operational director of the Opera del Duomo. When Jacopo Quercia left Siena in 1435, he had selected two counsellors to proceed his job. Domenico was one of the two witnesses to approve of Jacopo's nomination decisions.Pope-Hennessy, J. (1944).

Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/868719", "In the painting, the Virgin is also depicted in a way that had been popularized in Siena by Gentile da Fabriano: an Italian painter who was best known for his international gothic painting style.Pierce, C. (1921). Francesco di Gentile da Fabriano. American Journal of Archaeology, 25(4), 376-386. doi:10.2307/497454 Other artists who depicted the Virgin in a similar manner during this time were Giovanni di Paolo for his Branchini Madonna of 1427 and Andrea di Bartolo for his Madonna of Humility. Yet, there are several artistic elements within Domenico's Madonna of Humility that derive from techniques frequently observed in Florentine works.  The frontal view of The Virgin, who is presented in an asymmetric composition, is said to have been inspired by Masaccio's Madonna of Humility.Pope-Hennessy, John. The Study and Criticism of Italian Sculpture. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1980. Page 22 Foreshortened halos and Virgin's crown were rare during the time that Domenico di Bartolo's painting was executed, and can only be found in the Pisa altarpiece executed by Masaccio. There, too, is an illustration of the baby with fingers in his mouth, which strongly recalls back to Masaccio's Pisa altarpiece, which illustrates the Christ child eating grapes.Madonna of HumilityAbbot, Katherine Smith, Wendy Watson, Andrea Rothe, and Jeanne Rothe. The Art of DevoPanel Painting in Early Renaissance Italy. Middlebury College Museum of Art and Mount Holyoke College Art Museum , 2009. Domenico's Madonna of Humility successfully models lights and darks within the flesh tones, and this too is done in the style of Masaccio. However, renowned British art historian John Pope-Hennessy states in his articles that Domenico di Bartolo cannot be a fully Masacciesque painter. Whilst painters like Filippo Lippi or Andrea di Giusto depict their figures to stand up in a stiff manner, those of Domenico di Bartolo possess a certain \"Gothic flexibility\".  Hennessy observes a certain fluid quality in Bartolo's paintings. For example, the Madonna's knee is bent and the angels to the left of the Madonna have curved bodies. As a result, it is infinitely more likely that Domenico drew stronger influences for the painting's details from Jacopo della Quercia."]}, {"page": "Neptune and Triton", "response": ["Wittkower who subscribed to the view this was a reenactment of Virgil, was satisfied that this gesture was Neptune, with an \"angry look towards the water\", calming the waves with his trident.;  John Pope-Hennessy pointed out the defect that Bernini did not include the nereid if he was reenacting Virgil's passage, and suggested a quote from Ovid as basis; it was then counter-argued that this Ovid passage too was defective in failing to mention the trident explicitly. Collier pointed out it was peculiar that Neptune should wear a wrathful expression calming the sea, and suggested a different passage from Ovid where Neptune was in wrath, but this too was flawed as it did not mention Trident."]}, {"page": "Sir John Pope-Hennessy", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Pope-Hennessy"]}]}}
