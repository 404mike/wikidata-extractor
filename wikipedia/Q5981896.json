On another occasion it was said that \"the damage had been exaggerated for political reasons\" and that \"the Greeks were guilty of excessive cleaning of the marbles before they were brought to Britain.\" During the international symposium on the cleaning of the marbles, organised by the British Museum in 1999, curator Ian Jenkins, deputy keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities, remarked that \"The British Museum is not infallible, it is not the Pope. Its history has been a series of good intentions marred by the occasional cock-up, and the 1930s cleaning was such a cock-up\". Nonetheless, he claimed that the prime cause for the damage inflicted upon the marbles was the 2000-year-long weathering on the Acropolis."]}, {"page": "Parthenon Frieze", "response": ["The system of numbering the frieze blocks dates back to Adolf Michaelis's 1871 work Der Parthenon, and since then Ian Jenkins has revised this scheme in the light of recent discoveries.Jenkins, 1994, pp.50\u20131Particularly the manuscript of Francis Vernon of 1675, describing the frieze prior to the Venetian bombardment which shed new light on the \"Carrey drawings\" of 1674, see Bowie, Thimme, 1971, and B.

Smaller figures are thought to represent the children and pet dog of the ruling family. Only one of the two panels that made up the west pediment relief survives. In contrast to the static family scene on the east side, this shows soldiers moving in battle.Jenkins 2006, p. 199"]}, {"page": "Ian Dennis Jenkins", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Jenkins (curator)"]}, {"page": "Lion of Knidos", "response": ["*Ian Jenkins, The Lion of Knidos, British Museum, 2008"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Jenkins", "response": ["*Ian Jenkins (politician) (born 1941), Scottish politician", "*Ian Jenkins (curator), curator at the British Museum", "*Ian Jenkins (Royal Navy officer) (1944\u20132009), former Surgeon General of the British Armed Forces"]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2020", "response": ["*Ian Jenkins, 67, British archaeologist and curator.Ian Jenkins obituary"]}]}}
