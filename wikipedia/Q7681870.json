In her book EnGendering AIDS: Deconstructing Sex, Text, and Epidemic, Tamsin Wilton writes: \"People had been sickening and dying of mysterious conditions since the early 1970s, conditions that we can retrospectively diagnose as AIDS related. There was, for example, a phenomenon known as 'junkie pneumonia' which spread among some populations of injecting street drug users in the 1970s, and which is now believed to have been caused by HIV infection.\""]}, {"page": "Richard Dyer", "response": ["One of the most compelling parts of his argument is the intra-racial boundary work among whites. Gender and class create a hierarchy among whites, wherein women are read as whiter (\"purer\") than men and those of a higher class status are whiter than the lower classes.Dyer, Richard W. White: Essays on Race and Culture. New York: Routledge, 1997. page 51 The third chapter, \"The Light of the World\", is particularly important to this intra-racial boundary work in that it examines the relationship between beauty and whiteness and how white women are visually presented as whiter than their male counterparts through the use of light.Dyer, Richard W. White: Essays on Race and Culture. New York: Routledge, 1997. page 122 Dyer is in conversation with scholars such as David Roediger (author of The Wages of Whiteness, 1991), Tamsin Wilton (author of Immortal, Invisible: Lesbians and the Moving Image, 1995) and Susan Jeffords (author of Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era, 1994); and is therefore contributing to whiteness studies, film studies, and gender/sexuality studies."]}, {"page": "Healthcare and the LGBT community", "response": ["* Tamsin Wilton"]}]}}
