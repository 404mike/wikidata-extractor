P. Stewart, Caritas is given as the alternate tune to Marianne Nunn's version of the hymn One there is above all others, from the original by John Newton. Stewart dates the composition as from 1830. With the propagation of hymns and tunes through hymnals, Beaty's connection with the tune was kept, but his biographical details were lost: see 447 (One is kind above all others, a variant of Nunn's words) in the Handbook to the Mennonite Hymnary (1949)."]}]}}
