In the early 1960s Isaacs went on to design a scaled down aircraft based on the Hawker Fury, this was followed by a scaled down design based on the Supermarine Spitfire. He made plans available for the two designs to enable them to be built at home by amateurs. He inspired and helped many amateur builders.In 1988 he wrote his autobiography An Aeroplane Affair and he died in 2001.", "link_mentions": {}}}
