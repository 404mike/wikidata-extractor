Born in Norwich and educated at Downing College, Cambridge, Clapham worked at Rothamsted Experimental Station as a crop physiologist (1928\u201330), and then took a teaching post in the botany department at Oxford University. He was Professor of Botany at Sheffield University 1944\u201369 and vice chancellor of the university during the 1960s. He coauthored the Flora of the British Isles, which was the first, and for several decades the only, comprehensive flora of the British Isles published in 1952 and followed by new editions in 1962 and 1987. In response to a request from Arthur Tansley, he coined the term ecosystem in the early 1930s.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ecosystem", "response": ["The term \"ecosystem\" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist Arthur Tansley. The term was coined by Arthur Roy Clapham, who came up with the word at Tansley's request.

He later refined the term, describing it as \"The whole system, ... including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment\". Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as \"mental isolates\".
