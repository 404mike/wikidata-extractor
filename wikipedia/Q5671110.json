When awarded a free kick outside the penalty box, Liverpool opted to have Kevin Baron take it instead of Liddell as was usual. Baron passed it to Liddell, who struck the ball with such force, after a momentary pause, that the shot surprised the Huddersfield defence and goalkeeper Harry Mills, and silenced spectators.Keith, John (2005), pp. 157\u20138 Still played as a winger, Liddell finished the season with 19 goals in 40 league appearances.
