Although she could read her own work when written she could not write it in Gaelic.  She retained her songs and poems in her memory until others wrote them down for publication. She often referred to herself as M\u00e0iri Nighean Iain Bh\u00e0in (Mary, daughter of fair haired John), the name by which she would have been known in the Skye of her childhood.", "link_mentions": {}}}
