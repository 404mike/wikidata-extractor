It was formed in England in 1952 and was active until 1968. Informal meetings continued until 1990. Among its members were Derek Austin, Eric Coates, Jason Farradane, Robert Fairthorne, Douglas Foskett, Barbara Kyle, Derek Langridge, Jack Mills, Pauline Atherton Cochrane, Bernard Palmer, Jack Wells, and Brian Campbell Vickery. The group formed important principles on faceted classification and also worked on the theory of integrative levels."]}, {"page": "British National Bibliography", "response": ["A principal reason for deciding to adopt DDC 18 was the discovery that the sometimes manually adapted chain indexing, which depended on the structured unofficial schedule of DDC 14 could not be reliably computerized. From January 1974, BNB adopted a new indexing system: PRECIS (PREserved Context Indexing System) which was developed by Derek Austin out of research by the Classification Research Group into the theoretical basis for a new general classification scheme. Initial subject analysis by PRECIS indexers formed the basis of the entire subject package comprising index entries and references, DDC numbers, Library of Congress Classification numbers and Library of Congress Subject Headings.
