Elizabeth was born in the city of S\u00f8nderborg in 1912, which was then part of Schleswig-Holstein, but became part of Denmark after 1918. Having been born in S\u00f8nderborg Castle, she had previously changed her name to Berndt, to avoid association with pro-Nazi elements of the aristocratic Reventlow family, and spent much of World War II in Palestine and Egypt. Both Ronald and Elizabeth Tylecote maintained pro-Communist sympathies until the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956. His son, Andrew Tylecote is an economist."]}, {"page": "Ospan Batyr", "response": ["* Godfrey Lias, Kazak Exodus, London: Evan Brothers Limited (1956)"]}, {"page": "Tiger Sarll", "response": ["Shortly after Tiger went on as a journalist to report on the Rif War rebellion against the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. He then went on to catch pythons and alligators in Mexico for zoos and returned to England to start a circus act. During World War II he acted as a firefighter. His biography, written by Godfrey Lias OBE, was published after an appearance on the TV programme This is Your Life, where he notably failed to recognise some of his grown-up offspring (\"You're not one of mine, are you? Which one are you?\")."]}]}}
