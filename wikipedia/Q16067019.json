Palace were still playing in the claret and blue kit handed down from Aston Villa, paired with white shorts. The Magpies fielded a side featuring ten internationals, whilst Palace could count only four players who had tasted the Football League. The Glaziers captain Wilf Innerd had been on the books for Newcastle United, but had only made three appearances for the club, and Bill Forster and Archie Needham had managed twenty appearances between them for Sheffield United. The Palace team had been drawn predominately from the North of players who struggled to get into their home teams by former Middlesbrough manager Jack Robson. Thanks to these roots the squad were able to find accommodation for free and travelled up the day before, so avoiding a six-hour journey on the day of the match.", "| ||  || Bill Forster"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["Crystal Palace started their second season in a new division, having gained promotion from the Southern League Division Two the previous season. There were a number of personnel changes this season, with Archie Grant and captain Ted Birnie moving to Chelsea and George Walker going to New Brompton. Palace's hat-trick hero in their FA Cup exploits of last season, Walter Watkins, also moved on to Northampton Town. In their places Palace brought in a number of new faces.  Charles Ryan joined from Nunhead, Thomas Wills from Newcastle, Bill Forster from Sheffield United and Bill Ledger from Pryhope Villa.  Wilf Innerd was made captain and played in all but one of the club's League and Cup matches. The club struggled to find their feet on the new division, and failed to score in 13 of their matches, finishing the season in 19th position, one place off the bottom.  This was enough to ensure safety though, as for this season there was no relegation. Palace again called on a number of amateurs from the local area and beyond, including Henry Littlewort. Littlewort, who made his only appearance for the club this season, would go on to win a gold medal with the British Football team in the 1912 Olympics.", "|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Bill Forster"]}, {"page": "1907\u201308 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Bill Forster"]}, {"page": "1908\u201309 Crystal Palace F.C. season", "response": ["The 1908\u201309 season saw Palace fail to reach the heights of the previous season.
