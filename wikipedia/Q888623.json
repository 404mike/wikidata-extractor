Manchester United enjoyed a good return in the season following the Munich tragedy, as new signings and younger players integrated with crash survivors to achieve runners-up spot in the league.

He began to establish himself in the following season, as he scored 7 times in 27 outings, before adding 9 goals in just 20 games in the subsequent season. However, he found himself below the likes of Jimmy Murray, Dennis Wilshaw and Bobby Mason in the Wolves attack and managed only a peripheral role in their championship-winning campaign of 1957-58. The next season saw him similarly on the sidelines but he did manage an impressive 7 goals from just 13 games.
