He was born at Kilburn, London, on 6 June 1819; entered the Lyceum Opera orchestra, conducted by his master, wagstaff, as violinist when fifteen; continued his studies on the continent, and was soon afterwards employed as accompanist and solo violinist in London and the provinces. He founded, in conjunction with his mother, the Musical and Dramatic Academy in Soho Square, and was encouraged by its success to open a season of opera at Manchester, his pupils forming the nucleus of the company. Glover was joined in this or similar enterprises by his elder brother Edmund and Miss Romer. Returning to London he gave annual monster concerts at St. James's Hall and Drury Lane Theatre. His pupils Miss Emily Soldene, Miss Palmer, and many first-rate artists appeared, the length of the entertainments inspiring more than one foreign critic with philosophic reflections upon the English amateur's capacity of endurance.\nTo Glover belongs the credit of initiating the performance of Beethoven's 'Pastoral Symphony' with pictorial and choreographic illustrations in 1863; and 'Israel in Egypt' with scenery, dresses, and poses, in 1865. His cantata, 'Tam o' Shanter,' for tenor solo, chorus, and orchestra, was produced at the New Philharmonic, Berlioz conducting, on 4 July 1855, and pleased so greatly by its pleasant melodies, local colouring, and lively effects, that it was given at the following Birmingham festival, 30 August 'Ruy Blas,' opera, written and composed by Glover, was produced on 24 Oct. 1861 at Covent Garden, and was successful enough for frequent repetition and a revival two years later: the comic opera, 'Once too Often,' was first performed at Drury Lane on 20 Jan. 1862, 'The Coquette' in the provinces, 'Aminta' at the Haymarket, and 'Palomita' in New York. The overtures 'Manfred' and 'Comala,' the songs, 'Old Woman of Berkeley,' 'Love's Philosophy,' 'The Wind's a Bird,' are only a few of his compositions, many of which were published in America. From about 1849 to 1865 Glover undertook the musical criticisms for the 'Morning Post;' in 1868 he settled in New York as professor and conductor of Niblo's orchestra, and he died there on 28 October 1875.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Julia Glover", "response": ["One of her sons was Edmund Glover and another was William Howard Glover. In 1850, Glover announced her retirement from the stage. After two weeks confined to her bed, she appeared at Drury Lane for her farewell benefit performance on 12 July 1850 as Mrs. Malaprop in The Rivals. She was noticeably ill and weak during her performance and was unable to stand to receive her applause at the end of the play. Instead, the curtain rose to reveal Glover seated, surrounded by the rest of the cast. She died days later on 16 July 1850."]}, {"page": "William Glover", "response": ["*William Howard Glover (1819\u20131875), English musical composer and writer"]}, {"page": "Edmund Glover", "response": ["Glover was the eldest son of Julia Glover and half brother of William Howard Glover. He wrote two leather clad diaries in copper plate writing,  covering ten years of his daily life from Thursday May 9th 1850 to his death on 15th August 1860. The diaries (in private ownership), show a truly fascinating insite to his life and running of the theatres, showing finances and various financial debts that emerged from his over generosity to various friends and acquaintances. The first diary writing describing his delight of his granddaughter being born at a quarter to six o'clock. His family life and problems. He describes a visit by  steam train to witness a national public hanging of a notorious murderer at the time. Also references to, his son William's friendship with Charles Dickens. Towards the end of his life, his diary writings deteriorate right up until his final hours, when the doctor calls and he succumbs to TB. Most of his paintings are held in storage in the Glasgow museum. His painting of The Forge by Moonlight, (which is mentioned on its completion in the diaries) is in private hands, along with his ring enclosing a lock of his hair. He occupied for a time a leading position at the Haymarket Theatre London, and went to Edinburgh, where, under WH Murray, he played leading business. He appears to have joined that company about 1841. He was a man of diversified talents, a sound, though not a brilliant actor, a good dancer, fencer, and pantomimist, and the possessor of some skill in painting."]}]}}
