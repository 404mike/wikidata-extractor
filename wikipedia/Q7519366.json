It first aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 27 June 2002. It was written by Simon Mirren, and directed by Rob Bailey. In the episode, Kurdish rebels raid a Turkish Consulate while Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) is performing a routine bugging operation there. The raid is later revealed to be a distraction by a rogue faction group. The episode's plot is based on the Iranian Embassy Siege in 1980. After the original broadcast, it was seen by over 7 million viewers in the UK.", "The storyline to \"One Last Dance\" was somewhat based on the Iranian Embassy Siege, which took place in London on May 1980. Writer Simon Mirren noted the episode was hard to write, since he had to add two main storylines and tie them together - the Consulate siege and the bank robbery. Mirren was concerned that adding too much dialogue explaining certain aspects of the storyline would make the episode \"silly\". In the original pitch of the consulate siege, the terrorists were to abseil down from the roof, but was changed in favour of a ground assault. The police officer in the Consulate, Steven Burrows, was originally written to conceal a gun, and feeling guilty about never using it, but was cut."]}, {"page": "Spooks (series 1)", "response": ["The first series of Spooks was produced by Kudos Film and Television for the BBC.
