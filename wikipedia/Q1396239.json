He made his first start three days later, in a 2\u20130 defeat to Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. Two days after the Bolton match, Derby manager Nigel Clough praised O'Connor by saying; \"With only two [league] games played this season, we've seen the value of James already. He can play anywhere across the back four and he just slots in with no fuss whatsoever. He's a good, competent Championship player and there aren't too many about like him who can come in and do a job in so many positions; he's a very good and important player to have in the camp.\" He scored his first goal for the \"Rams\" in a 2\u20130 home win over Barnsley on 6 November. O'Connor covered at left back for the injured Gareth Roberts in December 2012, after he fell behind Jake Buxton and Mark O'Brien in the pecking order in central defence. In February 2013, it was reported that O'Connor had picked up a knee injury. In March, he returned to full first team training, with a scheduled return to the match-day squad for Derby's game on Good Friday, 29 March. However, he did not make a first team appearance before the end of the campaign, and ended the 2012\u201313 season with 23 appearances. In May 2013, O'Connor was informed that he would not figure regularly at Pride Park during the upcoming 2013\u201314 season, and he was allowed to look for a move elsewhere.

Most of Dobie's appearances in 2006\u201307 were from the substitutes bench. His only goal that season came in the 2006\u201307 League One play off semi-final against Yeovil.

After signing permanently for Lincoln he was mainly a bit-part player, but nonetheless made nearly a century of appearances for the club.

Bloomer was given his chance to start ahead of West for the League Cup first round match against Derby County. Lincoln won 3\u20131, Bloomer's performance was highly praised, and he went on to make a number of solid performances. He lost his starting place following an ill-fated first half against Wycombe Wanderers in early 2005. Bloomer moved from right back to central defensive position held by captain Paul Morgan, who was out with an injury, Wycombe scored three goals in the first 45 minutes, all from Nathan Tyson. He did not start again all season, with both Lee Beevers and Gareth McAuley playing in his position for the rest of the year, however, he did play as a striker in the play-off final in Cardiff, where Lincoln lost 2\u20130 after extra-time to Southend United.

Two fractious FA Cup ties, including one in which Derby came from 2\u20130 down to win 3\u20132 and win at the City Ground for the first time since 1971, did not help matters and Robbie Savage's post-match scarf waving did not endear him to the Forest support. Following a match on 29\u00a0August 2009, in which Forest won 3\u20132 to secure their first victory over Derby in 6\u00bd years, a post-match scuffle broke out between the Derby and Forest players after Nathan Tyson, in reaction to Savage's scarf waving the previous season, celebrated in front of the Derby County fans with a corner flag that had the Nottingham Forest logo on it, an incident the FA said it would investigate with some 'urgency' the end result of which saw both clubs fined for failing to control their players and Tyson charged with improper conduct. Derby were fined \u00a320,000, of which \u00a310,000 was suspended, and ordered to pay \u00a3400 costs; Nottingham Forest were fined \u00a325,000, of which \u00a310,000 was suspended, and ordered to pay \u00a31,200 costs; and Tyson was fined \u00a35,000. A second brawl broke out during the return fixture in January 2010 after Chris Gunter and Jay McEveley clashed when the latter refused to give up the ball for a Forest throw-in. The FA announced it would investigate the brawl whilst former Derby manager Billy Davies claimed that Nigel Clough had \"attacked\" him during the melee and made a formal complaint to the League Managers' Association. The fixture also saw players sent off in four consecutive meetings from January 2011; two for Derby (Dean Moxey and Frank Fielding) and two for Forest (Marcus Tudgay and Dexter Blackstock, both former Derby players).", "Since then, there have been few high-profile players who have played for both clubs. Those who have include goalkeepers John Middleton, Steve Sutton and Lee Camp, defenders Gary Charles, Gary Mills and Darren Wassall, midfielders Steve Hodge, Glyn Hodges, Darryl Powell and Lars Bohinen and forwards Mikkel Beck, Dexter Blackstock and Dean Saunders. On 30\u00a0May 2008 Rob Earnshaw became the first player to move directly between the two clubs for 15 years (since Gary Charles in 1993) when he agreed to a \u00a32.65m deal to join Forest from the Rams less than a year after moving to Pride Park. The move was followed three days later by Forest winger Kris Commons moving to Pride Park, though he was released by Forest first meaning he did not move directly between the two clubs. After rejecting a contract extension from Nottingham Forest in May 2011, striker Nathan Tyson joined Derby County in June 2011. In July 2015, former Derby forward Jamie Ward joined Forest on a free transfer having been released during the summer by Derby."]}]}}
