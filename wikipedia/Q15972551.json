The first Director was Helen Gordon. A subsequent Gibraltar Tourist Office was opened in Trafalgar Square, under the command of John Joe Gomez. Soon after, it opened a much larger office at 179 Strand, directed by Jose Rosado and later by Richard Garcia. In 1989, Albert Poggio took over as Director, a position which he has held to this date (he was briefly replaced by Peter Canessa between 2011 and 2012). In 2009, the Gibraltar House moved to its current location at 150 Strand.", "Although Albert Poggio had not become Director of the House until 1989, he had been suggesting the creation of a \"social centre\" in London since 1969, due to the work that he developed as Chairman of the Gibraltar Group, which congregated Gibraltarian expatriates in London."]}, {"page": "Gibraltar Hebrew School", "response": ["*Albert Poggio"]}]}}
