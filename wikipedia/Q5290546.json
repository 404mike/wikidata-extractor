Macabre artworks, and taxidermy were heavily referenced during the design process. As creature design supervisor Adam Johansen later stated in an interview, \"We tried to achieve a very home made feel for Possum but one that is twisted and disturbing.\" Using the film's script, Hailstone constructed storyboards showing possible designs for the character, which he then presented to the writer/director. The character's initial design proved to be not as effective as originally thought, with Holness feeling that the puppet's face was 'too expressive'. With only a week before filming was scheduled to commence, Holness and Hailstone came up with the idea of having the character's face be inexpressive in which the audience could project their own fears onto it. Hailstone then sculpted the \"Possum\"'s face, which was made to resemble Harris' character, in three to four hours, with Holness approving the final design. The film's reasonably low budget and tight production schedule limited the amount of time that the studio could spend on designing and constructing the character. The head, neck, and body of the \"Possum\" was constructed as a simple hand and rod puppet, with the body constructed out of foam latex and the head made out of fiberglass. The puppet's eight spidery legs were designed by Damian Martin, who constructed a jointed armature using multiple pick points of semi-rigid urethane, so that the puppeteering rods could be attached in multiple angles, and sides to allow more range and freedom while operating it. The puppet's complexity, including its eight fragile limbs, required multiple puppeteers to operate it during filming and presented numerous challenges."]}, {"page": "Hailstone (surname)", "response": ["*Dominic Hailstone (born 1973), English film director"]}]}}
