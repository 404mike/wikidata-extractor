The rationale underlying New Zealand's elimination of personal injury torts was securing equality of treatment for victims regardless of whether or the extent to which they or any other party was at fault. This was the basis for much of Professor Patrick Atiyah's scholarship as articulated in Accidents, Compensation and the Law (1970). Originally his proposal was the gradual abolition of tort actions, and its replacement with schemes like those for industrial injuries to cover for all illness, disability and disease, whether caused by people or nature. In addition to the development of the Accident Compensation Corporation to eliminate personal injury lawsuits, the tort system for medical malpractice was scrapped in New Zealand, both following recommendations from the Royal Commission in 1967 for 'no fault' compensation scheme (see The Woodhouse Report).P.S. Atiyah (1997) The Damages Lottery, Ch.8", "*Limits on damages for pain and suffering are another category of tort reform. While tort compensation easily applies to property damage, where the replacement value is a market price (plus interest), but it is difficult to quantify the injuries to a person's body and mind. There is no market for severed legs or sanity of mind, and so there is no price which a court can readily apply in compensation for the wrong. Some courts have developed scales of damages awards, benchmarks for compensation, which relate to the severity of the injury. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the loss of a thumb is compensated at \u00a318,000, for an arm \u00a372,000, for two arms \u00a3150,000, and so on,see, Guidelines for the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases (2006), which lay out the standard figures, up to \u00a3200,000 for severe brain damages but while a scale may be consistent, the award itself is arbitrary. Patrick Atiyah has written that one could halve, or double, or triple all the awards and it would still make just as much sense as it does now.see generally, Patrick Atiyah and Peter Cane, Atiyah's Accidents, Compensation and the Law (2006) 6th Ed., Cambridge University Press"]}, {"page": "Victoria College, Alexandria", "response": ["* Patrick Atiyah"]}, {"page": "Atiyah", "response": ["* Patrick Atiyah (1931-2018), English barrister and legal writer, brother of Michael"]}, {"page": "List of Australian National University people", "response": ["*Patrick Atiyah, English barrister and legal writer"]}, {"page": "Roderick Meagher", "response": ["Patrick Atiyah has criticised Meagher's conservative view of legal doctrine in the Law Quarterly Review."]}, {"page": "Patrick S.

Over the 1980s Atiyah's views shifted. He still argued that the tort system should be scrapped. But instead of relying on the state, he argued people should have to take out compulsory first party insurance, like that available for cars, and this model should be spread progressively.P.S.

Such a quota would usually amount to 25% to 30%. Such agreements, while lawful in the US, are considered unethical in the European Union."]}, {"page": "Edward Atiyah", "response": ["He came to England to study at Brasenose College, Oxford University, and there met and married a Scottish woman, Jean Levens.
