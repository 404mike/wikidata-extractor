Notable wildlife artist Fenwick Lansdowne stated that Pope \"gave us the first comprehensive, well executed pictorial record of Canadian birds.\" According to Pope's biographer, Pope contributed \"a great deal\" to Canada's settler heritage through his paintings and journals.Pope's watercolours of birds are often compared to the works of John James Audubon, though Pope's works were smaller in size and ambition.", "link_mentions": {}}}
