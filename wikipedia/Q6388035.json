Before that, the BBC was so boring! It took until about 1985 before we had FM radio.\" \"Radio 4\" was recorded and performed by Levene, initially with Ken Lockie from Cowboys International on drums, at Advision Studios. Levene played the bassline \"as if it was Wobble playing,\" and played a Yamaha String Ensemble to create the layered synth sounds. \"I was using this thing and I start building it up, all I'm doing is taking different sounds from this thing and layering it. When I heard it, I pulled the drums out. I got on the idea of trying to make it sound orchestrated with the long chords played shorter. To get round the other stuff, I just used what was at hand. I played bass like I imagined Wobble would play bass to it, I wanted a Wobble feel to it. But basically, it's all me \u2013 that's when I realised I can completely do everything. You just hear the drums at the end. [...] With 'Radio 4', I was just alone in the studio one night, and I was overwhelmed with the sense of space. I just took everything out of the studio, moved the drum kit out and played everything myself, reproducing this sense of cold spaciousness I felt around me.\""]}, {"page": "John McGeoch", "response": ["While still a member of Magazine and Visage, McGeoch also worked occasionally with other bands.
