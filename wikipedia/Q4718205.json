The locomotives supplied initially were classic Allan designs, small 2-2-2s and 2-4-0s, outside cylindered and with external framing and (initially at least) not even a weatherboard to protect the enginemen. It was later decided that a cab was essential to protect them from winter weather. Only four of the Barclay era locomotives, all rebuilt by Jones, were still in service at the time of the Grouping in 1923."]}, {"page": "Highland Railway \u2013 Jones locomotives", "response": ["Although Jones was a fervent disciple of Alexander Allan, Jones' new designs tended to break away from the Allan tradition, which had lasted so long in Scotland. One Allan feature that Jones did not perpetuate in his 4-6-0s was double framing around the outside cylinders. Allan's straight-link valve gear was, however, retained; this was basically similar to the corresponding Stephenson gear, but the link was easier and therefore cheaper to make and imparted a constant lead irrespective of cut-off. The \"Drummond\" Castle class was, mechanically, Jones\u2019 personal design, although the Drummond stamp of chimney, cab and 'water-cart' bogie tender was unmistakable. A dubious asset, without which none of the younger Drummond's locomotives was complete, was the provision of steam reverse, a troublesome mechanism if it were not well maintained."]}, {"page": "Locomotives of the London and North Western Railway", "response": ["The first Northern Division Locomotive Superintendent (at Crewe works) was Francis Trevithick, son of Richard Trevithick, who continued to build the basic 2-2-2 and 2-4-0 designs.

The reversing and cut-off functions were achieved by simultaneously raising the radius rod and lowering the link or vice versa. As with the Gooch gear, this saved space but the Allan gear gave performance closer to that of the Stephenson.  Moreover, the straight expansion link simplified manufacture. Once again, the Allan gear was not often used in the UK but fairly common on the Continent.  Notable UK examples are the Great Western Railway's 1361 and 1366 classes, and the narrow-gauge Ffestiniog Railway's 0-4-0TT class (which were produced by George England and Co.) and the narrow-gauge Talyllyn Railway's original locomotives, Talyllyn and Dolgoch (which were produced by Fletcher, Jennings & Co.)."]}, {"page": "David Jones (railway)", "response": ["He joined what would later become the Highland Railway in 1855 at age twenty-one. In 1870, he became its locomotive superintendent and, like most such occupants of that position, spent much of his time rebuilding old engines in order to extract a few more years from them. Although he was a fervent disciple of Alexander Allan, Jones' new designs tended to break away from the Allan tradition, which had lasted so long in Scotland."]}, {"page": "Slide valve", "response": ["The balanced slide valve was invented by the Scottish engineer Alexander Allan. It was not much used in the UK but, at one time, had great popularity in the United States. It gave some of the advantages of a piston valve to a slide valve by relieving the pressure on the back of the valve, thus reducing friction and wear."]}, {"page": "Edge Hill railway works", "response": ["An immediate problem was the frequency of broken crank axles on the inside-cylindered 2-2-2 locomotives from a range of manufacturers.

They became known as the \"Old Crewe\" type."]}, {"page": "Jones, Turner and Evans", "response": ["By 1850, the design of most of the locos was to Alexander Allan's pattern, with outside cylinders, and the long-boiler 4-2-0 popularised by Robert Stephenson. As a result, they had a very rough ride and derailed frequently. They also built five 0-6-0 engines for the Scottish lines, which, however were converted to 0-4-2.

It was widely copied elsewhere, particularly in France.", "During the early 1840s Alexander Allan and William Buddicom of the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) created the design incorporating inclined outside cylinders and a double frame. It was built due to combat the frequent failure of crank axles on contemporary inside cylinder locomotive designs.

It was typical of express passenger locomotives of its era in having a single driving axle with large ( in this instance) driving wheels to achieve high speeds, while avoiding the friction associated with coupled driving wheels. (Coupling was done primarily on goods locomotives, where tractive effort was more important than speed.) The locomotives bore a resemblance to 2-2-2 designs by Patrick Stirling and Joseph Beattie, yet could also be regarded as a development of Alexander Allan's designs under Ramsbottom's predecessor, Francis Trevithick. They had an open cab, a smokebox door that opened vertically, and open slots on the \"splashers\" that covered the driving wheels."]}, {"page": "1809 in Scotland", "response": ["* Alexander Allan, locomotive engineer (died 1891 in England)"]}, {"page": "The Railway Detective", "response": ["On his trip to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Colbeck is disturbed by seeing the Black Country and afterwards tells Leeming that he now understands exactly what William Blake meant when he wrote about the \"dark, satanic mills\". Colbeck is nevertheless intrigued by industry, especially the railways, and in conversations he refers to Edward Bury, Thomas Russell Crampton and Daniel Gooch as engineers and locomotive designers he especially admires. Caleb Andrews speaks well of Alexander Allan, who claimed to be the designer of the Crewe type locomotive involved in the robbery. The engine was a 2-4-0 introduced by the L&NWR for freight in 1845. Allan was L&NWR works manager at Crewe Works from 1843 to 1853."]}, {"page": "Grand Canal Street railway works", "response": ["The D&KR had initially set up an \"Engine Hospital\" for the servicing of locomotives at Serpentine Avenue, about  south west of  past the River Dodder where railway cottages were subsequently built.  The Serpentine depot had two sections, one for the three engines from Robert Sharps, initially supported by their engineer Francis Wrigley, and the three from Forresters supported by their man Alexander Allan."]}, {"page": "Forrester single (locomotive)", "response": ["In December 1833, with time running short to get locomotives built for their planned start of operations the D&KR board finally placed based an order for three locomotives from Sharp Brothers that were to become the Hibernia type, and three from George Forrester.  They would have originally preferred to have placed all six with one manufacturer for parts commonality however ability to complete the build in the needed timescale had become a priority and degrees of uncertainty about both designs may have been a factor. Forrester had not built any locomotive prior to the D&KR order, so winning the order may seem unexpected.  Forrester did have some advantages: Liverpool base at convenient to the L&MR and their workshops; Good communications with regular steam packet to Dublin; previous component build work for the L&MR; amiable relations with the customer; and a reputation for good workmanship, though that may have gained later.  The design may have been evolved with the collaboration of or intention to satisfy Vignoles and Bergin.  Snell claims Vignoles obtained a set of drawings from Dodds, albeit Snell also claims Dodds influence was not present until later D&KR engines.  While seemingly not involved in the design the employment of Alexander Allan from Stephenson's would have been a help.  It is also the case Forrester was given the Stephenson locomotive Milo by the L&MR in 1834 with a view to a repair quote; the L&MR eventually accepting Milo was uneconomic to repair leaving Forrester to scrap Milo and with the L&MR proving Swiftsure as a replacement \u2014 the precise dates are unclear and it was possibly too late in the year to reverse engineer any of Milos features into the Forrester design.", "Maintenance of the class was at the Serpentine Road \"engine hospital\" with one section reserved for Forrester locomotives with their man Alexander Allan on site for one year per the purchase contract.", "The class was to form the basis for the locomotives produced for the D&KR excepting the three from Sharpes and Star from Dodds.  The locomotives Alexander Allan went on design for the Grand Junction Railway and London and North Western Railway (including the Crewe type (locomotive)) showed influences from Forrester practice."]}]}}
