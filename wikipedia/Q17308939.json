Cypriot antiquities are strong too and have benefited from the purchase of Sir Robert Hamilton Lang's collection as well as the bequest of Emma Turner in 1892, which funded many excavations on the island. Roman sculptures (many of which are copies of Greek originals) are particularly well represented by the Townley collection as well as residual sculptures from the famous Farnese collection."]}, {"page": "Nathan Davis", "response": ["Nathan Davis is the name of:", "*Nathan Davis (traveller) (1812\u20131882), British missionary and amateur excavator at Carthage", "*Nathan Davis (actor) (1917\u20132008), American actor ", "*Nathan Davis (saxophonist) (1937\u20132018), American jazz saxophonist", "*Nathan Davis (gridiron football) (born 1974), defensive lineman", "*Nathan Davis (basketball), American college basketball coach", "*Nathan Davis (rugby league) (born 1995), Australian rugby league player"]}, {"page": "Newton Stone", "response": ["*Phoenician (Nathan Davis, Theodor Aufrecht, William Mill)"]}, {"page": "Nathan Davis (archaeologist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nathan Davis (traveller)"]}, {"page": "Carthaginian tombstones", "response": ["* Augustus Wollaston Franks (1860).
