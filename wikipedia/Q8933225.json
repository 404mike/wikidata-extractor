Intended as a vehicle for The Goodies, who turned it down, the film was eventually released as White Cargo (1973) and starred a young David Jason in one of his earliest leading roles.\nMcGillivray was soon involved in the British sex film industry, writing scripts for The Hot Girls (1974) and I'm Not Feeling Myself Tonight (1976), two films produced by pornographer John Jesnor Lindsay. As would be the case with many of his films, McGillivray makes cameo appearances in both: in I\u2019m Not Feeling Myself Tonight he is \u201cMan at Party\u201d who pulls Monika Ringwald\u2019s dress off while in The Hot Girls he was given the job of doing an onscreen interview with Danish actress Helli Louise, who according to the synopsis in Cinema X magazine, talks to him about \"working on a movie, and telling a few facts of life about screen nudity and enacting lesbian love scenes.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Wicker Man", "response": ["David McGillivray of The Monthly Film Bulletin praised the film as \"an immensely enjoyable piece of hokum, thoroughly well researched, performed and directed.\" Variety wrote that Anthony Shaffer's screenplay \"for sheer imagination and near-terror, has seldom been equalled.\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \"a witty work of the macabre\" with \"the splendid performances typical of British films.\"Thomas, Kevin (14 March 1979). \"A Witty Search in 'Wicker Man'\".

Roger Ebert was less condemnatory, awarding two-and-a-half stars out of four and describing it as \"corny escapism,\" although he made a similar observation about Black's character - that she is made to seem incompetent simply because she is a woman.
