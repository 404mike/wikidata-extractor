However, the 1880 U.S. Census shows a Theophilus Thompson, 24 years of age, in his home state of Maryland working as an oysterman in Anne Arundel County. Later on, the 1920 census lists this person as a waterman in the oyster industry, overestimated as 69 year old, married to Alice C.

Dr. Theophilus Thompson, who was Wathen's brother-in-law, served as his London agent, and sent two copies of the magazine to the writer Charles Dickens for comment. Dickens politely wrote back to Thompson in a 27 June 1851 letter that though the Australasian was \"a most creditable production, it would be more encouraging if the articles were honestly purchased, rather than pirated.\" Nonetheless, 8 volumes of the Australasian were published over two years, with a total of 600 pages.Story et al.
