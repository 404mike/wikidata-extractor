Since then his research has encompassed theoretical syntax, language acquisition, the savant syndrome, and general linguistic theory, particularly the work of Noam Chomsky.\nIn the 1990s he began working with an autistic man, Christopher, in collaboration with Ianthi-Maria Tsimpli. According to Smith and Tsimpli, Christopher has a non-verbal IQ of between 60 and 70, but his English is comparable to that of normal native speakers, and he has an extraordinary ability to learn new languages.\nSmith was Head of the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics at University College London from 1983 to 1990, and headed the Linguistics section from 1972 until his retirement in 2006, when he was presented with a Festschrift Language in Mind: A Tribute to Neil Smith on the Occasion of his Retirement (edited by Robyn Carston, Diane Blakemore and Hans van de Koot).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Faurisson affair", "response": ["Chomsky's biographers have expressed a range of views on the Faurisson affair. In Chomsky: Ideas and ideals, Neil Smith writes: 'Chomsky should perhaps have foreseen the negative effect of his activity and refrained from writing the way he did. Perhaps, but on balance perhaps not. Even had he seen the furore which would erupt and the degree that would ensue, the moral doctrine of defending freedom of speech is probably higher.'Neil Smith (1999). Chomsky: Ideas and ideals.

The condition is associated with an increased memory capacity, which would aid in the storage and retrieval of knowledge of a language. In 1991, for example, Neil Smith and Ianthi-Maria Tsimpli described Christopher, a man with non-verbal IQ scores between 40 and 70, who learned sixteen languages. Christopher was born in 1962 and approximately six months after his birth was diagnosed with brain damage. Despite being institutionalized because he was unable to take care of himself, Christopher had a verbal IQ of 89, was able to speak English with no impairment, and could learn subsequent languages with apparent ease. This facility with language and communication is considered unusual among savants."]}, {"page": "Neil Smith", "response": ["*Neil Smith (American football) (born 1966), in the NFL", "*Neil Smith (cricketer, born 1967), English cricketer", "*Neil Smith (cricketer, born 1949) (1949\u20132003), English cricketer for Yorkshire and Essex", "*Neil Smith (footballer) (born 1971), English", "*Neil Smith (ice hockey) (born 1954), Canadian executive and broadcaster", "*Neil Smith (musician), former bassist in AC/DC and Rose Tattoo", "*Neil Smith (linguist) (born 1939), British linguist", "*Neil Smith (geographer) (1954\u20132012), Scottish-born American professor", "*Neil Smith (writer), Canadian fiction writer", "*L.
