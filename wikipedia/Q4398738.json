She has trained with snooker coaches Sedge McClelland and Stephen Rowlings in snooker, and with eightball-pool world champion Mick Hill as well as Pete Mercer. Like many players, she has various nicknames; hers include \"the Ice Maiden\" for her cool demeanor, as well as \"Spinny\", \"Spinderella\", and \"Wee One\" for her short stature of only  even. This is unusual in the sport, in which reach is an advantage and lack of it requires development of skill with the  ( stick). Horsburgh says she plays in high stiletto heels to compensate, though it causes foot discomfort. She shoots with the same custom-shortened Joe Davis 146 cue stick she has used since her days at the Commonwealth Sporting Club, and favoured three Blackpool snooker halls during their heyday: Potters, Great Harwood, and Rileys. Aside from Steve Davis, she cites Ronnie O'Sullivan as a favourite player. As of 2007, she was sponsored by ProMasters. In 2008, she began working as a personal pool and snooker coach, and an exhibition player (with Karl Boyes, Mick Hill, and Ian McCulloch)."]}, {"page": "Snooker world ranking points 2009/2010", "response": ["| 91 ||  || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Stephen Rowlings"]}, {"page": "2010 Welsh Open (snooker)", "response": ["* 125  Stephen Rowlings"]}, {"page": "Mei Xiwen", "response": ["Mei made his debut on the Main Tour in the 2009/2010 season, as the ACBS Asian nomination, playing his first match at the 2009 Grand Prix.
