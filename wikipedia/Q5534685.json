About half of Fred Hoyle's science fiction works were co-written with his son.He was educated at Bryanston School in Dorset, and then entered Cambridge where he read Economics. After 1964, Hoyle worked in London in the field of modern communications and the film/television industry. Unlike his father, he is not a scientist, and contributed to the more \"human\" side of their novels \u2013 however, he did work as a \"scientific advisor\" to some series such as Timeslip.\nIn 2010, his book 2010: Living in the Future was popularised by a blog which compared Hoyle's 38-year-old predictions with the reality of modern life. This led to a Facebook campaign to track down Hoyle and talk to him about his visions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Hoyle", "response": ["Sir Fred Hoyle FRS (24 June 1915\u00a0\u2013 20 August 2001) was an English astronomer who formulated the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis.

However, in order to give the series as authentic a veneer as possible, Geoffrey Hoyle, son of physicist Fred Hoyle and a noted science fiction author in his own right, gave his advice regarding how time travel might be possible.
