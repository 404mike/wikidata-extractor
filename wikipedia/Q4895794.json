L. Putnam Weale\" (or sometimes simply \"Putnam Weale\"). Lenox Simpson was the son of Clare Lenox-Simpson, who had been in the Chinese Maritime Customs Service since 1861; he had a brother, Evelyn, a mining engineer who worked in China, and a sister, Esme. His education was at Brighton College, after which he too joined the Service. He was in China during the Boxer Rebellion and during the siege of the legations. After this, he became Brigade Interpreter for the British Expeditionary Force (he spoke 5 languages).Lenox Simpson left the Chinese Maritime Customs Service in 1901, perhaps connected with zealous looting after the siege of the Legations in 1900. One historian calls him \"the consummate treaty port jobbing hack, writing commentaries, begging for newspaper work, penning novels... and serving as Daily Telegraph correspondent in Beijing from 1911 to 1914.\" He remained in China, and began a prolific career writing about China and the Far East. His 1914 novel, The Eternal Princess has the earliest reference as yet located to the apocryphal sign in Shanghai's Huangpu Park, \"No Dogs or Chinese.\" As of 1916 he was working for the political section of the office of the President of China. One researcher reports that \"During the period of September 1916 to June 1917, he had written at least thirty-eight reports on foreign affairs for the Chinese government. Many of them were ... read by President Li Yuanhong.\" His journalistic career in China included periods as editor of the Peking Leader and as chairman of the Far Eastern Times syndicate.Sir Ernest Satow refused to be introduced to Putnam Weale when he was at Peking (1900\u201306) 'on account of his character'.By 1930 Lenox Simpson had become thoroughly embroiled in Chinese internal politics and thus took control of customs in Tianjin on behalf of Yan Xishan. He was killed in what some believed to have been an assassination. This was difficult to conclusively prove, because the killers were never caught or identified.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boxer Rebellion", "response": ["Also on 11 June, the first Boxer was seen in the Legation Quarter.
