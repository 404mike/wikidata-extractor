The scene of the story is London with a panorama of coloring, ranging from the magnificence of Buckingham Palace to the mysterious depths of the shadowy Limehouse district. The author personally arranged the scenario for Mr. Read, the producer.

The plot centers about Sonia's captivity in the house of a celebrated crook, her discovery of mysterious maneuverings to poison all London, and the intense climax which follows directly after her recognition of her father, \"The Lone Wolf\", who has been working, unknown to her or by her, in the same household.
