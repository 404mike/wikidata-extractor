A local man, born and raised in St. Philip's Marsh, he played chiefly as a right-back for the club for thirteen years from 1945 until his death in 1958, making 486 league appearances and scoring five goals in the process. Never sent off, booked or even spoken to by a referee, he gained a reputation for sportmanship and gentlemanly conduct. An unflappable, cultured right back, who preferred, sometimes to the disquiet of managers and supporters alike, to play the ball out of defence even in the tightest of situations, he never lost the attacking instincts of the forward he had been in his younger days, and operated very much in the style of a modern wing-back. Bamford was an integral part of the Rovers' side which won promotion from Division Three (South) to Division Two in 1953 under manager Bert Tann.Bamford joined Rovers in December 1945, having been spotted while playing for St. Silas School Old Boys. Before his call-up in 1939 to the First Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment where he played at a high level for Army football and rugby teams in Burma and India, he had played for local Bristol teams as a forward, including his school St. Silas, winning three caps for and captaining Bristol Boys, and also playing briefly for Bristol City Colts. He had also signed amateur forms with Ipswich Town. Because of the war, his professional career began at the relatively late age of 25, but in spite of this he played in the second highest number of Bristol Rovers games of any players at the club, behind only Stuart Taylor.\nIn the summer of 1951, Bamford was part of an England 'B' XI that toured Australia drawing huge crowds.While still a player, Bamford had become a qualified FA coach. He was riding his motorcycle to a coaching session with the boys of Clark's Grammar School in Clifton on 28 October 1958 when he was involved in a collision with a delivery van in Apsley Road. He remained in Frenchay hospital for three days before dying from his injuries on 31 October.Bamford had been a regular for Rovers until an injury in the 3 September 1958 game against Derby County meant he was replaced by Brian Doyle and, even when fit again, was playing in the Reserves.\nHis funeral was held at the church of St. Mary Redcliffe on Thursday 6 November 1958 and was attended by over a thousand people. Many more lined the route taken by the cortege to Arnos Vale Cemetery. A fund set up for his widow Violet and two daughters (one born posthumously), The Harry Bamford Memorial Fund, raised over \u00a36,000, swelled by the proceeds of a memorial game between a Combined Bristol XI and Arsenal on 8 May 1959.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people who died in traffic collisions", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Harry Bamford"]}, {"page": "List of Bristol Rovers F.C. players", "response": ["In the club's early history the appearance record was held by goalkeeper Arthur Cartlidge,Byrne & Jay (2003), p. 82 who played in 258 Southern League games between 1901 and 1909.Byrne & Jay (2003), p. 88 His record stood until it was broken by another goalkeeper, Jesse Whatley, who played 14 times in the Southern League and a further 372 in The Football League, making a total of 386 overall.Jay & Byrne (1994), pp. 286\u2013287 Following the Second World War the Bristol Rovers board introduced a no-buy/no-sell policy, which remained in force until the abolition of the maximum wage in football in 1961; as a result some players in that era had a high number of appearances for the club.Giles (2007), p. 22 Eight of the top nine most-used players played during this time, each making over 400 appearances.
