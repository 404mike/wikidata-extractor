He was initially elected in the family interest, when his family owned Tamworth Castle, but could not expect to continue in 1818 after the Townshend trustees had sold the castle, but was defeated when Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, the owner of Drayton Manor in nearby Drayton Bassett and his son William canvassed against him.

Townshend supported the petition, and all the children were duly declared illegitimate by a private Act of Parliament in 1843Francois Velde (2007) \"Genetically Challenged\" Queen message from alt.talk.royalty, posted 30 May 2007. The message says in part: \"The Townshend peerage case was one where marquis Townshend (then called Lord Chartley) married Sarah Dunn Gardner in 1807; a year later she left her husband, sued in Ecclesiastical court to have the marriage annulled because of his impotence but dropped the suit and eloped with a brewer of St. Ives. Their children initially bore the brewer's name (Margetts) but from 1823 took the name Townshend, and one took the style of Earl of Leicester. The marquis took no steps to dissolve the marriage, and his brother had no means to dispute the legitimacy of the so-called Earl of Leicester, because no property depended on the title. As time went by and witnesses died off, it seemed the imposture might not be preventable. So the brother and heir presumptive petitioned the house of Lords for inquiry respecting the descent of these honours in May 1842. The next year the marquis himself also petitioned the House.", "Townshend died in Genoa in December 1855, aged 77, without issue. His only brother Lord Charles Townshend, the petitioner in the legitimacy case, had predeceased him and left no sons. Therefore, the Earldom of Leicester became extinct, while the baronies of Ferrers of Chartley and Compton fell into abeyance between his nephew (his middle sister's son) and his youngest sister, and remain in abeyance today.
