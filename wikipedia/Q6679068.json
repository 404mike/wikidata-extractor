He was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Tamworth in 1812, a seat he held until 1818, and again between 1820 and 1835.  He was initially elected in the family interest, when his family owned Tamworth Castle, but could not expect to continue in 1818 after the Townshend trustees had sold the castle, but was defeated when Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, the owner of Drayton Manor in nearby Drayton Bassett and his son William canvassed against him.  However he was re-elected unopposed in 1820.Townshend died in November 1853, aged 68, having previously repurchased Tamworth Castle.", "link_mentions": {}}}
