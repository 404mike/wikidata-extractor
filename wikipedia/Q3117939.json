She took him on a tour of England and Scotland in 1848, and took charge of the disposal of his effects and manuscripts after his death in 1849. While there is no evidence they were lovers, she was often referred to, after Chopin's death, as \"Chopin's widow\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin", "response": ["After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Mallorca with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of pericarditis aggravated by tuberculosis.", "In April, during the 1848 Revolution in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and numerous receptions in great houses. This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil Jane Stirling and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.", "In late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, where he stayed at Calder House near Edinburgh and at Johnstone Castle in Renfrewshire, both owned by members of Stirling's family. She clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzyma\u0142a: \"My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores\", and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was \"closer to the grave than the nuptial bed\". He gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September, and another in Edinburgh at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October. In late October 1848, while staying at 10 Warriston Crescent in Edinburgh with the Polish physician Adam \u0141yszczy\u0144ski, he wrote out his last will and testament\u00a0\u2013 \"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere\", he wrote to Grzyma\u0142a.", "With his health further deteriorating, Chopin desired to have a family member with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter, and in September, supported by a loan from Jane Stirling, he took an apartment at the H\u00f4tel Baudard de Saint-James on the Place Vend\u00f4me. After 15 October, when his condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him. Viardot remarked sardonically, though, that \"all the grand Parisian ladies considered it de rigueur to faint in his room.\"", "Chopin's tombstone, featuring the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, was designed and sculpted by Cl\u00e9singer and installed on the anniversary of his death in 1850. The expenses of the monument, amounting to 4,500 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid for the return of the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. As requested by Chopin, Ludwika took his heart (which had been removed by his doctor Jean Cruveilhier and preserved in alcohol in a vase) back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who destroyed them."]}, {"page": "1859 in music", "response": ["*February 6 \u2013 Jane Stirling, pianist and friend of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (born 1804; ovarian cyst)"]}, {"page": "Dunblane Cathedral", "response": ["*Jane Stirling (1804-1859) daughter of the above", "*Jane Stirling, pianist"]}, {"page": "Achille Dev\u00e9ria", "response": ["Dev\u00e9ria was also known for doing portraits of artists and writers, whom he entertained in his Paris studio on Rue de l'Ouest.
