Gielgud played the central role many times: his 1936 New York production ran for 132 performances, leading to the accolade that he was \"the finest interpreter of the role since Barrymore\". Although \"posterity has treated Maurice Evans less kindly\", throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded by many as the leading interpreter of Shakespeare in the United States and in the 1938/39 season he presented Broadway's first uncut Hamlet, running four and a half hours. Evans later performed a highly truncated version of the play that he played for South Pacific war zones during World War II which made the prince a more decisive character. The staging, known as the \"G.I. Hamlet\", was produced on Broadway for 131 performances in 1945/46. Olivier's 1937 performance at The Old Vic was popular with audiences but not with critics, with James Agate writing in a famous review in The Sunday Times, \"Mr. Olivier does not speak poetry badly. He does not speak it at all.\" In 1937 Tyrone Guthrie directed the play at Elsinore, Denmark, with Laurence Olivier as Hamlet and Vivien Leigh as Ophelia."]}, {"page": "June 3", "response": ["*1901 \u2013 Maurice Evans, English actor (d. 1989)"]}, {"page": "James Whale", "response": ["In 1928 Whale was offered the opportunity to direct two private performances of R. C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives a glimpse into the experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fianc\u00e9e.Green, et al., p. 272. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role,Cottrell, p. 53. but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role,Williamson, p. 29. Olivier having accepted an offer to take the lead in a production of Beau Geste.Coleman, p. 31. The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations.Curtis, p. 70. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play \"managed to coalesce, at the right time and in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like\".Curtis, p. 71. After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years.Coleman, p. 32."]}, {"page": "March 12", "response": ["*1989 \u2013 Maurice Evans, English-American actor (b. 1901)"]}, {"page": "The Importance of Being Earnest", "response": ["Other audio recordings include a \"Theatre Masterworks\" version from 1953, directed and narrated by Margaret Webster, with a cast including Maurice Evans, Lucile Watson and Mildred Natwick;\"The Importance of Being Earnest\", WorldCat, accessed 28 July 2013 a 1989 version by California Artists Radio Theatre, featuring Dan O'Herlihy Jeanette Nolan, Les Tremayne and Richard Erdman;\"The Importance of Being Earnest\", WorldCat, accessed 2 August 2013 and one by L.A.
