From 1917 to 1948, Rosson directed 61 feature films (including co-direction of Red River).  He also worked on many major films as a second unit director until 1960, particularly for Cecil B. DeMille.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Howard Hawks", "response": ["Beginning in early 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood with the group of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, risk-taking men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story. Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens."]}, {"page": "1960", "response": ["* June 17 \u2013 Arthur Rosson, English film director (b. 1886)"]}, {"page": "His Girl Friday", "response": ["Hawks encouraged aggressiveness and unexpectedness in the acting, a few times breaking the fourth wall in the film. At one point, Grant broke character because of something unscripted that Russell did and looked directly at the camera saying \"Is she going to do that?\". Hawks decided to leave this scene in the picture. Owing to the numerous ensemble scenes, many retakes were necessary. Having learned from Bringing Up Baby (1938), Hawks added some straight supporting characters in order to balance out the leading characters. Arthur Rosson worked for three days on second unit footage at Columbia Ranch. Filming was completed on November 21, seven days past schedule. Unusually for the time period, the film contains no music besides the music that leads to the final fade out of the film."]}, {"page": "Red River (1948 film)", "response": ["The film was shot in black and white rather than color, because director Howard Hawks found Technicolor technology to be too \"garish\" for the realistic style desired. Second unit director Arthur Rosson was given credit in the opening title crawl as co-director. He shot parts of the cattle drive and some action sequences. The film's ending differed from that of the original story. In Chase's original Saturday Evening Post story, published in 1946 as \"Blazing Guns on the Chisholm Trail\", Valance shoots Dunson dead in Abilene and Matt takes his body back to Texas to be buried on the ranch.", "To commemorate their work on the film, director Howard Hawks had special Western belt buckles made up for certain members of the cast and crew of Red River. The solid silver belt buckles had a twisted silver wire rope edge, the Dunson brand in gold in the center, the words \u201cRed River\u201d in gold wire in the upper left and lower right corners, the initials of the recipients in the lower left corner, and the date \"1946\" in cut gold numerals in the upper right corner. Hawks gave full-sized (men's) buckles to John Wayne, his son David Hawks, Montgomery Clift, Walter Brennan,  assistant director Arthur Rosson, cinematographer Russell Harlan, and John Ireland. Joanna Dru and Hawks' daughter Barbara were given smaller (ladies') versions of the buckle. According to David Hawks, other men's and women's buckles were distributed, but he can only confirm the family members and members of the cast and production team listed above received Red River D buckles."]}, {"page": "Mervyn LeRoy", "response": ["| Arthur Rosson, Johnny Hines"]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Arthur Rosson"]}, {"page": "List of show business families", "response": ["* Actress Helene Rosson was a noted silent screen actress.
