In the US, Samuel George Morton, Josiah Nott and Louis Agassiz promoted this theory in the mid-19th century. Polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th century, culminating in the founding of the Anthropological Society of London (1863), which, during the period of the American Civil War, broke away from the Ethnological Society of London and its monogenic stance, their underlined difference lying, relevantly, in the so-called \"Negro question\": a substantial racist view by the former, and a more liberal view on race by the latter."]}, {"page": "Scientific racism", "response": ["left|thumb|Charles White", "==== Charles White ====", "Charles White (1728\u20131813), an English physician and surgeon, believed that races occupied different stations in the \"Great Chain of Being\", and he tried to scientifically prove that human races have distinct origins from each other. He believed that whites and Negroes were two different species. White was a believer in polygeny, the idea that different races had been created separately. His Account of the Regular Gradation in Man (1799) provided an empirical basis for this idea. White defended the theory of polygeny by rebutting French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon's interfertility argument, which said that only the same species can interbreed. White pointed to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves, and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed. For White, each race was a separate species, divinely created for its own geographical region."]}, {"page": "Polygenism", "response": ["Charles White was another advocate of co-Adamism, although he used less theology to support his views.Livingstone, p. 15.
