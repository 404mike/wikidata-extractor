Born in Leyland, Lancashire, he was spotted by Football League First Division side Sheffield United while playing non-league football with Leyland Motors. He moved to Sheffield in February 1921, but was released in January 1922 after failing to make a first-team appearance.\nBennett subsequently rejoined Leyland Motors, but his stay was short-lived as he joined Chorley in March 1922. At the end of the season, he was signed by Football League Third Division North outfit Nelson. He initially played in the reserve team, but was called up to the first-team for the match against Rochdale on 25 November 1922 due to an injury to regular inside forward Arthur Wolstenholme. Bennett did not make an impact on the match as Nelson fell to a 1\u20132 defeat, and he returned to the reserves for the remainder of the campaign.\nIn March 1923, he again re-signed for Leyland Motors where he stayed until September 1924, when he joined Lytham. He left the club in 1925 and retired from football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Bennett (disambiguation)", "response": ["William Bennett (born 1943) is an American conservative pundit, political theorist and former Secretary of Education.", "*William Bennett (English politician) (1873\u20131937), Member of Parliament for Battersea South, 1929\u20131931", "*William Bennett, Mayor of Rockford, Illinois, 1911\u20131917", "*William Bennett (Australian politician) (1843\u20131929), member of the Tasmanian Parliament", "*William Bennett (oboist) (1956\u20132013), San Francisco Symphony oboist", "*William Bennett (flautist) (born 1936), British flute player", "*William Bennett, British experimental musician and founding member of Whitehouse and Cut Hands", "*William Bennett (headmaster), teacher and teachers' representative in South Australia", "*William Bennett (clergyman) (\u20131857), British-born Methodist minister", "*William Bennett (cricketer) (1807\u20131886), cricketer", "*William Bennett (footballer) (1896\u2013?), English footballer with Nelson", "*William Bennett (football manager), Cuban football manager", "*William Bennett (painter) (1811\u20131871), English watercolour painter", "*William Bennett (Australian engineer) (1824\u20131889), (William Christopher Bennett) Irish-Australian surveyor and engineer"]}, {"page": "Leyland, Lancashire", "response": ["* William Bennett, 1920s footballer"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["| William Bennett", "October began with a 1\u20133 defeat away at Ashington, although new signing Arthur Wolstenholme scored his first goal of the campaign, and Nelson's first ever league goal against the Northumberland club. A 2\u20130 win in the return match with goals from Eddleston and McCulloch took Nelson to the top of the league for the first time in the season the following week, overtaking Wigan Borough at the summit. The month ended with a pair of wins over Tranmere Rovers; the first a 2\u20130 win on 21 October, and the second a 1\u20130 success a week later thanks to John Black's first goal in a Nelson jersey. The team failed to score for only the second time in the season in the 0\u20131 away defeat to Barrow on 4 November. Despite conceding at Seedhill for the first time in the campaign, Nelson atoned for the loss seven days later with a 2\u20131 victory as a result of strikes from Eddleston and Wolstenholme. Nelson did not play another league match for two weeks, when they faced Rochdale at home. A first Nelson goal for defender Ernie Braidwood could not prevent the side succumbing to a 1\u20132 reverse, not helped by first-team regulars Wilson and Wolstenholme missing the match due to injury, forcing inexperienced inside-right William Bennett to make his league debut.Dykes, p. 19", "|align=\"left\"|William Bennett"]}]}}
