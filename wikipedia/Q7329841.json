His elder brother changed his name to Milles.Watson was commissioned into the 11th Hussars, a cavalry regiment, and served in the Peninsula. He first stood for parliament at the 1826 general election in Canterbury, where he was nominated in his absence by the Reformers and polled just 107 votes. However, at the 1830 general election he topped the poll at Canterbury, with 1,334 votes, was returned unopposed in 1831, and again won a contested election in 1832, when one of the other candidates was the madman John Nichols Thom, calling himself Sir William Courtenay, otherwise 'Tom of Truro', who gained 375 votes. Watson was so dismayed by the support given to this opponent that he declined to stand again at the 1835 general election.On 21 December 1839 Watson married Lavinia Jane, a daughter of Lord George Quin, granddaughter of Thomas Taylour, 1st Marquess of Headfort, and great-niece of George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer. They had three sons and two daughters, the last of whom was posthumous:\nGeorge Lewis Watson, married Laura Maria (d. 1893), daughter of Sir John Hobart Culme-Seymour, 2nd Baronet, in 1867, without issue\nEdward Spencer Watson (d.

His body was brought home to England and buried at Rockingham, Northamptonshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Canterbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Richard Watson"]}, {"page": "Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Hon.

In the December 1832 general election Liberal support in the town was so overwhelmingly strong that the Conservatives decided against fielding any candidates. Stung by jeers about being afraid to stand, some local Conservatives asked Tom to stand as an independent candidate for Canterbury, hoping he would at least inconvenience the Liberals. He polled a creditable 375 votes (against 834 for Richard Watson and 802 for Viscount Fordwich, the Liberal candidates).Rogers: 20-24 He then decided to stand in the East Kent election but polled only a derisory three votes, including his own, and thereafter turned his attention to publishing a weekly paper, The Lion. Eight issues of the paper were produced. Full of biblical quotations, it argued for the rights of the poor, expressed loyalty to the Crown, and was critical of the clergy, aristocracy, town corporations and Parliament.Rogers: 32 Tom's biographer described the views expressed in The Lion as showing \"amazing common sense... far in advance of those generally held in his time\", for example, regarding rents, taxation, the Irish problem, and corporal punishment, although he concedes that these \"occasional shafts of light\" were surrounded by \"turgid nonsense\".Rogers: 40-41"]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": [":Richard Watson, 17 years (1835\u20131852)"]}, {"page": "Sir Michael Culme-Seymour, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["He married 16 October 1866 Mary Georgina Watson, daughter of the Hon Richard Watson, MP (1800\u20131852) and granddaughter of the 2nd Lord Sondes.
