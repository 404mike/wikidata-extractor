Upon graduation, he received a commission as a militia officer and saw service in Egypt and Sudan before enrolling in the Staff College at Camberley. There, he befriended individuals who would be his contemporaries when he attained senior rank in France. Following distinguished service during the First World War\u2014specifically, with the British Expeditionary Force in France, in the Battle of Gallipoli, as commander of the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge, and as commander of the British Third Army\u2014Byng was elevated to the peerage in 1919. In 1921, King George V, on the recommendation of Prime Minister David Lloyd George, appointed him to replace the Duke of Devonshire as Canada's governor general, a post he occupied until the Viscount Willingdon succeeded him in 1926. Byng proved to be popular with Canadians due to his war leadership, though his stepping directly into political affairs became the catalyst for widespread changes to the role of the Crown in all of the British Dominions.\nAfter his viceregal tenure, Byng returned to the UK to be appointed Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and was promoted within the peerage to become Viscount Byng of Vimy. Three years after attaining the rank of field marshal, he died at his home, Thorpe Hall on 6 June 1935.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)", "response": ["*Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, General (later Field Marshal), British Army"]}, {"page": "June 6", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, English field marshal and politician, 12th Governor-General of Canada (b. 1862)"]}, {"page": "September 11", "response": ["*1862 \u2013 Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, English field marshal and politician, 12th Governor General of Canada (d. 1935)"]}, {"page": "1862", "response": ["** Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, British general, 12th Governor General of Canada (d. 1935)"]}, {"page": "1935", "response": ["**Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, British general, 12th Governor General of Canada (b. 1862)"]}, {"page": "Eton College", "response": ["*Field Marshal Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy, WWI commander and Governor-General of Canada"]}, {"page": "List of governors general of Canada", "response": ["| Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy(1862\u20131935)"]}, {"page": "General Julian H.G.
