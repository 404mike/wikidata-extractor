Kant did not reject the logical (analytic a priori) possibility of non-Euclidean geometry, see Jeremy Gray, \"Ideas of Space Euclidean, Non-Euclidean, and Relativistic\", Oxford, 1989; p. 85.  Some have implied that, in light of this, Kant had in fact predicted the development of non-Euclidean geometry, cf. Leonard Nelson, \"Philosophy and Axiomatics,\" Socratic Method and Critical Philosoph, Dover, 1965, p. 164.  This view was at first somewhat challenged by thinkers such as Saccheri, then finally overturned by the revolutionary discovery of non-Euclidean geometry in the works of Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss (who never published his theory). They demonstrated that ordinary Euclidean space is only one possibility for development of geometry. A broad vision of the subject of geometry was then expressed  by Riemann in his 1867 inauguration lecture \u00dcber die Hypothesen, welche der Geometrie zu Grunde liegen (On the hypotheses on which geometry is based), published only after his death. Riemann's new idea of space proved crucial in Albert Einstein's general relativity theory. Riemannian geometry, which considers very general spaces in which the notion of length is defined, is a mainstay of modern geometry."]}, {"page": "The Story of Maths", "response": ["The Story of Maths is a four-part British television series outlining aspects of the history of mathematics.
