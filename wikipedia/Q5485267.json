By this time, Southampton were fifth in the table, two points and two places behind their neighbours, but with two games in hand. A crowd of 12,000 (described as a \"dense mass of humanity\") descended on The Dell on a \"brilliantly fine and crisp\" afternoon. Portsmouth's long-term goalkeeper, the Ireland international, Matt Reilly was injured, with his place being taken by the inexperienced Darling. Portsmouth raced into a two-goal lead, with goals from Frank Bedingfield and Steve Smith before the Saints started to put Darling under pressure. Saints equalised through a penalty scored by Edgar Chadwick and a goal from Joe Turner, but Portsmouth's goalkeeper demonstrated \"superb coolness\" to prevent Saints going ahead before Bedingfield added a third goal. Saints again equalised through Chadwick, who \"beat Darling all ends up\", resulting in a \"ding dong struggle\" of end to end football, before Dan Cunliffe scored the final goal for the visitors, who held firm for \"a meritorious win\"."]}, {"page": "Bedingfield (surname)", "response": ["*Frank Bedingfield (1877\u20131904), English footballer with Aston Villa, Queens Park Rangers and Portsmouth in the 1890s and 1900s"]}]}}
