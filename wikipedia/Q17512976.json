Herbert William Bird, a partner of the firm from 1901 to 1928, was also a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Hong Kong public records suggest that Palmer & Turner arose out of Palmer & Bird \u2013 a prominent firm at the time whose senior partner was Lennox Godfrey Bird, younger brother of HW Bird. It is known that Clement Palmer, then only 23 years of age, designed the first Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building in 1883. Arthur Turner, a structural engineer, joined the firm in 1884.
