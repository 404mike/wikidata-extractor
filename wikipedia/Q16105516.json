But his captaincy ended in some controversy. According to Wisden, Mushtaq resigned, claiming that his future had not been made clear and that there were rumours \u2013 which turned out to be true \u2013 that former captain Jim Watts was to be reappointed for 1978. Mushtaq had in any case signed for World Series Cricket in Australia, but there were harsh words from the county's chairman about dressing room politics and Mushtaq did not play for Northants again."]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Jim Watts"]}, {"page": "1979 Gillette Cup Final", "response": ["After winning the toss, Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to bowl first. Somerset scored 269 runs off their full allocation of 60 overs, during which West Indian batsman Viv Richards top-scored for the county, totalling 117 runs. In their response, Northamptonshire lost early wickets, but a partnership of 113 between Geoff Cook and Allan Lamb kept them in the game. Six wickets from Joel Garner helped Somerset bowl their opponents out for 224 with 3.3 overs remaining, earning the county the first trophy in their 104-year history.", "The sun was shining on the morning of the final, and Somerset's captain Brian Rose was glad when Northamptonshire won the toss. The conditions favoured batting first, but had Somerset won the toss they would most likely have chosen to bat second, given their success in chasing throughout the season. Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to field, giving Somerset the benefit of batting first.Marks (1984), pp. 69\u201370. Somerset's opening batsmen began quickly, taking the score to 34 before Peter Denning was caught by the wicket-keeper George Sharp off the bowling of Sarfraz Nawaz. His wicket in the seventh over brought in Viv Richards.Marks (1984), p. 70. Before going out to bat, Richards focussed his mind on the fact that \"it wasn't a day for daring, carefree sixes. It was a day for maturity\". Rose played a patient innings for his 41 runs, before being bowled by Watts, leaving Somerset 95/2. At the other end, Richards was playing what David Foot described as \"a controlled gem\".Foot (1986), p. 198. He remained at the wicket until the final over, scoring 117 runs in a chanceless innings. His boundaries were scored predominantly from straight drives and leg hits, powerfully struck. Ian Botham played aggressively when he came in at number five, scoring 27 runs off 17 deliveries, and Joel Garner played similarly when he batted towards the end of the innings, adding 24 runs to the total. Somerset batted through their full allocation of overs, finishing on 269/8. Of the Northamptonshire bowlers, Watts was the most economical, conceding 34 runs off his 12 overs. Tim Lamb conceded the most, allowing 70 runs to be scored from his 12. The wickets were shared by the bowlers; Watts, Lamb and Griffiths took two each, while Sarfraz Nawaz and Peter Willey claimed one apiece. Towards the end of the innings, Watts broke a bone in his right hand when catching a throw from the outfield, which prevented him from participating further in the match.", "|| Jim Watts || 12 || 2 || 34 || 2 || 2.83", "| Jim Watts * || absent hurt || \u2013 || \u2013 || \u2013"]}, {"page": "Peter Watts (cricketer, born 1938)", "response": ["He is the elder brother of Jim Watts, who played alongside him for Northamptonshire as a left-handed middle order batsman and right-arm medium-pace bowler and who was also later a successful captain of the team."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Jim Watts (1960\u20131965) : P.
