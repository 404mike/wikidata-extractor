But \"Rocket 88\" does have a couple of elements which \"The Fat Man\" did not. The wailing saxophone and that distorted electric guitar. It was number one in the rhythm and blues chart for five weeks, it is in the Grammy Hall of Fame and it was an indisputable claim to fame for Ike Turner....To critics he will be known as a great founder, unfortunately to the general public he will always be known as a brutal man.Nigel Cawthorne\u2014co-author of Turner's autobiography\u2014said:Although there had been black rock 'n' rollers who had made it big already, they really only played to a white audience. Ike and Tina played to a mixed audience and he deliberately desegregated audiences in the southern states and he wouldn't play to any segregated audiences at all. Because he had such a big band and entourage he desegregated a lot of the hotels because the hotel chains wouldn't want to miss out on the money they would make from him touring the southern states.Turner's songs have been sampled by hip hop artists, most notably Salt-n-Pepa used \"I'm Blue\" for their 1994 hit \"Shoop\". Jurassic 5 used \"Getting Nasty\" from A Black Man's Soul on the track \"Concrete Schoolyard\" in 1997, Main Source also sampled \"Getting Nasty\" on the track \"Snake Eyes\" as well as Ike & Tina Turner's \"Bold Soul Sister\" on \"Just Hanging Out\"; both featured on their 1991 album  Breaking Atoms. The track \"Funky Mule\", also from A Black Man's Soul, has been sampled extensively by jungle DJs, with the drum introduction being a very popular break. It was sampled by producer Goldie for his 1994 hit \"Inner City Life\", in the same year by Krome & Time on \"The License\", and by Paradox in 2002 on track \"Funky Mule\".", "In 1999, Turner published his autobiography Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner. It was written with Nigel Cawthorne and Little Richard wrote the introduction. In 2003, John Collis published Ike Turner: King of Rhythm about the life and musical contributions of Turner."]}, {"page": "List of military writers", "response": ["* Nigel Cawthorne \u2013 POW histories: The Bamboo Cage, The Iron Cage"]}, {"page": "Bertie Wooster", "response": ["Bertie is approximately 24 years old when he first meets Jeeves in \"Jeeves Takes Charge\".Wodehouse (2008) [1925], Carry On, Jeeves, chapter 1.

He abolished flogging, but his implementation of the death penalty was brutal, as he insisted all executions be carried out at a banquillo (\"stool\") under an orange tree outside his window. To avoid wasting bullets, most victims were bayoneted, and their families were not allowed to collect the corpses until they had been lying there all day to make sure that they were dead.Nigel Cawthorne, Empress of South America, p. 33", "Contrary to popular belief, Paraguay was not completely isolated. Francia welcomed political refugees from various countries. Jos\u00e9 Artigas, the hero of Uruguay's independence, was given asylum in 1820, along with 200 of his men.

In 1820, Francia ordered for runaway slaves to be given refuge and for refugees from Corrientes to be given canoes and land. In 1839, a whole company of Brazilian deserters was welcomed.
