Myers died in 1901, and various mediums were organised into concurrent sittings at locations very far apart, and notes were made of the words and phrases, and the automatic writings thus obtained. The messages were unintelligible individually and to individual mediums, but over a long period and many seances, it was claimed by the SPR that there was purpose in the correspondences, indicating an intelligent entity was behind them.

The exhibition attracted the attention of Winifred Coombe Tennant, who would become Walters's most important patron. After meeting Walters to commission him to paint her portrait and portraits of her husband and children, she described him as \"A young dark typical Welshman. Very intelligent and pleasant... He has genius.\" His fame in Wales grew when he became joint winner of a number of art prizes at the 1926 National Eisteddfod of Wales in Swansea, where Augustus John was one of the two adjudicators. Walters had designed the poster advertising the Eisteddfod but the entire print run was pulped due to a perceived sexual innuendo in the design. Winifred Coombe Tennant managed to save a single copy. That year he was also given a one-man exhibition in the Dorothy Warren Gallery in London, where his industrial subject manner was embraced by left-leaning critics in the wake of the General Strike. This and John's opinion that \"a new genius had emerged\" were widely reported in the London press. He was characterised as a \"collier-artist\", though he had never worked in the coal industry. During the General Strike, Walters painted Welsh Funeral Hymn showing four naked youths, marked with stigmata, on a coal tip with a choir and chapel in the background."]}]}}
