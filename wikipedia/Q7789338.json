The Wantsum Channel is shown separating the island from mainland Kent.]]", "The site's history in the Anglo-Saxon period begins with the division of the Isle of Thanet into eastern and western parts during the 7th century. The division is attributed in medieval sources to the route taken by a tame female deer that was set free to run across the island by \u00c6bbe, founder and first abbess of the double monastery at Minster-in-Thanet, thereby marking out its endowment. The route was circuitous, beginning on the north side of the island at Westgate-on-Sea and ending on the south side at Sheriff's Court, halfway between Minster-in-Thanet and Monkton, which are about  apart. While land to the east of this route was given to \u00c6bbe for her monastery, which was in existence by 678, land to the west, described broadly as Westanea, or \"the western part of the island\", was given to the monastery at Reculver by King Hlothhere of Kent in 679.;  ; . This division of the island is apparent in Domesday Book, which was compiled in 1086, and remained an important feature in the early 15th century, when it was included prominently in a map of the island drawn up by Thomas Elmham. According to Edward Hasted the division was still marked in 1800 by \"a bank, or lynch, which goes quite across the island, and is commonly called St. Mildred's lynch.\"", "The monastery at Reculver had been established in 669, and developed as the centre of a \"large estate, a manor and a parish\". By the early 9th century it had become \"extremely wealthy\", but it then came under the control of the archbishops of Canterbury. By the 10th century the church and its estate appear to have fallen into royal hands, since King Eadred of England gave them in 949 to Christ Church, Canterbury, now known as Canterbury Cathedral. The Anglo-Saxon charter recording the gift shows that the Reculver estate still included land in the west of the Isle of Thanet at that time. Two slightly earlier charters give a more complicated picture: in 943, King Edmund I of England gave land at St Nicholas-at-Wade to a layman, and in the next year he gave the same layman land at Monkton, by means of a charter recording that land to the west and north of Monkton\u00a0\u2013 evidently at Sarre\u00a0\u2013 was nonetheless still regarded as belonging to Reculver, rather than to either the archbishop or the king. However, while Edmund I's mother Eadgifu gave lands in Kent, including Monkton, to Christ Church in 961, all of the documents recording these transactions entered the Christ Church archive;    and, if the land that Christ Church acquired on the Isle of Thanet in the 10th century was the same as the \"Liberty\" shown on Thomas Elmham's map from the early 15th century, then the site of All Saints' Church, Shuart, must have been included. Neither Shuart nor St Nicholas-at-Wade are mentioned by name in Domesday Book; but they may have been included in the entry for Reculver, which was then recorded as a hundred in its own right, and was held entirely by the archbishop of Canterbury, but for a portion held from him by a tenant. An analysis of the archbishop's holdings in Domesday Book concludes that All Saints' was among them.", "Thomas Elmham's map of the Isle of Thanet, drawn in the early 15th century, shows the church with its tower, but a map of 1596 by Philip Symonson, which shows churches \"as they actually appeared\", shows a church without a tower. Examination of the church's foundations indicates that it was probably a ruin by the middle of the 15th century and was demolished, but was replaced by a smaller structure, without a tower, up to 20\u00a0years later. It may be that material from All Saints' Church was used in the construction of a new clerestory for the nave of St Nicholas' church in the late 15th century, and the medieval baptismal font now in Reculver's parish church of St\u00a0Mary the Virgin at Hillborough probably came from All Saints'. By 1630 there was no church: in that year, the vicar and churchwardens of St\u00a0Nicholas-at-Wade reported the existence of glebe of  called \"Allhallows close, in part of which antiently stood the chapel of All Saints, or Alhallows\"; and, in 1723, antiquarian John Lewis wrote that the church was \"now so entirely demolished, with all the fences around it, that there are no marks of either of them.\""]}, {"page": "Thomas de Elmham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Elmham"]}, {"page": "Thomas Sprott (chronicler)", "response": ["Sprott wrote a history of St Augustine's Abbey.

It is possible that the abbot and community of Reculver took refuge from the Vikings in Canterbury, as the abbess and community of Lyminge did in 804.; . A monk of Reculver named Ymar was recorded as a saint in the early 15th century by Thomas Elmham, who found the name in a martyrology, and wrote that Ymar was buried in St John's Church, Margate: Ymar was probably killed by Vikings in the 10th century, and hence regarded as a martyr.; . The Church in East Kent seems broadly to have \"preserved its primary ... character against all the odds\", but evidence for the monastery at Reculver is lacking: by the 11th century the monastery had \"dropped out of sight entirely\". The last abbot is recorded as Wenredus: although it is unknown when he was abbot, it must have been after 890\u00a0\u2013 possibly 905\u00a0\u2013 when the name of Abbot Beornhelm last appears in Anglo-Saxon charters.; ; . The church was last described as a monastery in about 1030, when it was governed by a dean named Givehard and was home to monks, two of whom are named as Fresnot and Tancrad: these names indicate the presence of a religious community from the European continent, probably Flemings.; ;  This may have been nothing more than a temporary \"resurgence of communal life at Reculver, at least for a period in the earlier eleventh century.\u00a0... [Perhaps] the old minster\u00a0... was provided as a refuge for a body of foreign clerics\".", "The church building was considerably enlarged over time. The outer walls of the north and south porticus were extended westwards to enclose the nave in the 8th century, forming a series of rooms, including chapels on both northern and southern sides, and a porch across the western side. The towers were added as part of an extension with a new west front in the late 12th century, when the internal walls of the rooms added in the 8th century were demolished, creating aisles on the north and south sides of the nave. In the 13th century the original apse was demolished and the chancel more than doubled in size, incorporating a triple east window of lancets with columns of Purbeck Marble, and in the 15th century north and south porches were added to the nave.; ; ; . At some point in the same period, according to J.\u00a0Russell Larkby, a sundial was added to the south wall of the south tower, about  from the ground. A chantry in the church was endowed in 1354 in memory of Alicia de Brouke, and two more were endowed in 1371 by Thomas Niewe, a former vicar of Reculver.; . These chantries were suppressed in the reign of Edward VI, in 1548 or very early in 1549. The towers were topped with spires by 1414, since they are shown in an illustrated map drawn by Thomas Elmham in or before that year, and the north tower held a ring of bells, accessed by a spiral staircase.; ; ; . The addition of the towers, \"an extraordinary investment ... for a parish church\", and the extent to which the church was enlarged in the Middle Ages, suggest that \"a thriving township must have developed nearby.\"; . Despite all the building work, the church retained many prominent Anglo-Saxon features, and one in particular roused John Leland to \"an enthusiasm which he seldom displayed\" when he visited Reculver in 1540:"]}, {"page": "Elmham, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Elmham"]}, {"page": "Gesta Henrici Quinti", "response": ["The author of the book is believed to be either Thomas Elmham or Joannes de Bordin, but since the true identity of the author has not yet been confirmed, he is described by most sources as anonymous."]}]}}
