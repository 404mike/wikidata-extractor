The Glasgow Herald reporter thought the \"disappointing\" match would be of little value to the selectors, in part because of a perceived lack of effort by some of the participants compared with that shown in a competitive fixture. Robertson hit the crossbar in the first half, the match finished goalless, and no call-up ensued. That same season, he helped Falkirk reach the Cup Final, in which they faced Raith Rovers at Celtic Park. Despite the Courier view that Robertson was \"the least noticeable\" of Falkirk's forwards, as [James] Logan \"saw to it that the bulky centre did not get off the leash\", he was off it long enough to open the scoring after Jimmy Croal's shot was saved, and Tom Logan's second-half goal gave his team a 2\u20130 win and their first Scottish Cup."]}]}}
