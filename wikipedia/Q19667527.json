He claimed that Stanton's coverage of his studio's game The Slaughtering Grounds as \"Worst Game of 2014 Contender\" was not protected under fair use law because he did not believe it was \"fair\" criticism. An additional lawsuit for $18 million was filed against 100 users on the Steam gaming platform for criticizing their games and business practices, which he had interpreted as \"harassment\". The judge issued a subpoena against Valve to disclose the identities of those 100 users. This resulted in Valve removing all published games from Digital Homicide Studios.

Its ambitions paid off, earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005, and the top rank on IGN's Readers' Picks Top 99 Games list. However, this also led some reviewers to suggest that the Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre, by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established. Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action, such as Silent Hill Homecoming, and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark. These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay. These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games. Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface, thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat. Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics, which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror."]}, {"page": "Shadow the Hedgehog", "response": ["Shadow is a divisive Sonic character.

However, Zach Meston of GameSpot and a reviewer for Next Generation were less forgiving, with Meston deriding the gameplay as \"flat as roadkill on a four-lane highway\", and the Next Generation reviewer declaring the game to be \"the single most derivative game to ever hit a console\". While the linearity of the levels and lack of room for exploration was a source of disappointment, the shifting perspectives between levels was acknowledged as interesting, although the fixed camera caused reviewers to experience difficulty in judging jumps. The gameplay variety provided by these altered perspectives as well as the bonus rounds and gems was appreciated. The game's difficulty level was commended as challenging without becoming frustrating, though Glide and Dan Tsu of Electronic Gaming Monthly respectively felt that the bosses and enemies were easy to dispatch. While Radakovic applauded the game's controls, critics generally deemed them to be satisfactory if somewhat sluggish. A reviewer for Official UK PlayStation Magazine considered the save points to be \"a little misplaced\", pointing out a portion of the second island in which there is no save point for three levels.
