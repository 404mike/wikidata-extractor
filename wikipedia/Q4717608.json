Most notably, \"Trans Europe Express\" and \"Numbers\" were interpolated into \"Planet Rock\" by Afrika Bambaataa & the Soul Sonic Force, one of the earliest hip-hop/electro hits. Kraftwerk helped ignite the New York electro-movement. Techno was created by three musicians from Detroit, often referred to as the 'Belleville three' (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson & Derrick May), who fused the repetitive melodies of Kraftwerk with funk rhythms. The Belleville three were heavily influenced by Kraftwerk and their sounds because Kraftwerk's sounds appealed to the middle-class blacks residing in Detroit at this time. Depeche Mode's composer Martin Gore emphasized: \"For anyone of our generation involved in electronic music, Kraftwerk were the godfathers\". Vince Clarke of Erasure, Yazoo and Depeche Mode, is also a notable disco and Kraftwerk fan. Daniel Miller, founder of Mute Records, purchased the vocoder used by Kraftwerk in their early albums, comparing it to owning \"the guitar Jimi Hendrix used on 'Purple Haze'\".\"Synth Britannia\", BBC Four, 19 October 2009. Excerpt. Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys, founding members of OMD, have stated that Kraftwerk was a major reference on their early work, and covered \"Neon Lights\" on the 1991 album, Sugar Tax. The electronic band Ladytron were inspired by Kraftwerk's song \"The Model\" when they composed their debut single \"He Took Her to a Movie\". Aphex Twin noted Kraftwerk as one of his biggest influences and called Computer World as a very influential album towards his music and sound. Bj\u00f6rk has cited the band as one of her main musical influences. Electronic musician Kompressor has cited Kraftwerk as an influence. The band was also mentioned in the song \"Rappers We Crush\" by Kompressor and MC Frontalot (\"I hurry away, get in my Chrysler. Oh, the dismay!/Someone's replaced all of my Backstreet Boys with Kraftwerk tapes!\"). Dr. Alex Paterson of the Orb listed The Man-Machine as one of his 13 most favourite albums of all time.

Somehow, Trent heard my stuff and really liked it.\" He added, \"Someone told me that Alex Paterson from The Orb played my Plug stuff for Trent and someone else told me that Coil played it for him.

Trevor Fung, Nicky Holloway, Ian Saint Paul, Danny Rampling and Johnny Walker accompanied him. Oakenfold convinced the owner of a venue in England to host an \"Ibiza Reunion\" party after-hours. He had previously made an attempt, but it failed as the crowd was not prepared for the acid house style until 1987 when the party was successful. After that, the night became a classic and became one of the UK's major acid house nights, known as Spectrum at Heaven in Charing Cross. The party was best known for the \"Theatre of Madness\", as more than 1,500 people were present on Monday nights, until it went down; with the financial issues it changed its name to the \"Land of Oz\". Artists like Alex Paterson DJ'd in the VIP chillout area known as the \"White Room\", which gave Oakenfold more free time, and then he began producing music under the alias \"Electra\" in 1988. Members included Nick Divaris, John \"Johnny\" Rocca and Micky.  As they continued releasing only four singles as the Balearic beat band Electra, in Full Frequency Range Recordings (FFRR Records) founded and run by Radio 1's Pete Tong, the duo created a new alias under the name Perfecto.
