The team's form quickly improved, however, as they beat Bury in the return fixture 3\u20130 and went on a seven-game unbeaten run to move up to the top five in the league table. Despite this run of form, which also included a 3\u20130 win at home to The Wednesday, Southampton's main goal threat Bill Rawlings did not score until October, when he picked up the only goal in a 1\u20130 win over recently promoted Bristol City; during this period, recent signing Harold Pearson \u2013 who had replaced Rawlings in the side after the first six games of the campaign \u2013 was the club's top scorer with three goals.
