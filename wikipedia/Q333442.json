By the mid-1920s, he was living in Elsfield and had become president of the Scottish Historical Society and a trustee of the National Library of Scotland, and he also maintained ties with various universities. Robert Graves, who lived in nearby Islip, mentioned his being recommended by Buchan for a lecturing position at the newly founded Cairo University. In a 1927 by-election, Buchan was elected as the Unionist Party Member of Parliament for the Combined Scottish Universities. Politically, he was of the Unionist-Nationalist tradition, believing in Scotland's promotion as a nation within the British Empire.\" The effects of the Great Depression in Scotland, and the subsequent high emigration from that country, also led him to reflect in the same speech: \"We do not want to be like the Greeks, powerful and prosperous wherever we settle, but with a dead Greece behind us\". He found himself profoundly affected by John Morley's Life of Gladstone, which Buchan read in the early months of the Second World War. He believed that Gladstone had taught people to combat materialism, complacency, and authoritarianism; Buchan later wrote to Herbert Fisher, Stair Gillon, and Gilbert Murray that he was \"becoming a Gladstonian Liberal.\""]}, {"page": "Frederic William Maitland", "response": ["* Herbert Fisher"]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Education", "response": ["| Herbert Fisher"]}, {"page": "University of Sheffield", "response": ["*1912: Herbert Fisher"]}, {"page": "Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["This followed the resignation of Charles Stuart-Wortley on 16 December.
