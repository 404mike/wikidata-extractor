Born in 1880 to businessman Alfred Nind Hopkins and Eliza Mary Castle, Hopkins was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. First serving with the Board of Inland Revenue, 'Hoppy' was appointed chairman in 1922. In 1927 Hopkins was transferred to the Treasury, where he became the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury in 1942 and served in that position until 1945. He is credited with the (re)introduction of economist John Maynard Keynes in the Treasury during the Second World War, whose influence proved to be essential in many economic policy decisions (Middleton 2004).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Civil Service (United Kingdom)", "response": ["| Sir Richard Hopkins"]}, {"page": "HM Treasury", "response": ["*Richard Hopkins (1942\u20131945)"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1936\u20131952)", "response": ["*Sir Richard Hopkins (1880\u20131955)"]}, {"page": "Permanent Secretary to the Treasury", "response": ["*Sir Richard Hopkins (1942\u20131945)"]}, {"page": "Richard Hopkins", "response": ["Richard Hopkins may refer to:", "* Richard Hopkins (died 1682) (1612\u20131682), English politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1660", "* Richard Hopkins (died 1708) (1641\u20131708), English politician who sat in the House of Commons variously between 1670 and 1701", "* Richard Hopkins (died 1799) (1728\u20131799), MP for Dartmouth, Thetford, Queenborough and Harwich", "* Sir Richard Hopkins (died 1736), MP for the City of London 1724\u20131727", "* Richard Hopkins (civil servant) (1880\u20131955), British civil servant", "* Richard Hopkins (TV producer) (1964\u20132012), British television producer", "* Sir Richard Hopkins (governor), governor of the South Sea Company from 1733"]}, {"page": "1944 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference", "response": ["* UK Sir Richard Hopkins Permanent Secretary to the Treasury"]}, {"page": "Hoppy (nickname)", "response": ["* Richard Hopkins (civil servant) (1880\u20131955), British civil servant"]}, {"page": "Richard Valentine Nind Hopkins", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Hopkins (civil servant)"]}]}}
