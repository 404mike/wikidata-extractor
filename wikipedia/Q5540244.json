Brother of Arnold Eardley and Elgin Eardley.\nEardley was 32 years old, and an acting sergeant in the 4th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry, British Army during the Second World War when he was awarded the VC.\nOn 16 October 1944 east of Overloon, the Netherlands, Sergeant Eardley's platoon was ordered to clear some orchards where a strong opposition was holding up the advance, but 80 yards (73 m) away from the objective the platoon was halted by automatic fire from machine-gun posts. Sergeant Eardley spotted one of these posts and moving forward under heavy fire killed the officer at the post with a grenade. He went on to destroy two more posts single-handed, under fire so intense that it daunted those who were with him, but his action enabled the platoon to achieve its objective and thus ensured the success of the whole attack.He later was appointed company sergeant major (CSM).\nEardley was interred at Macclesfield Cemetery in Cheshire.His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London. A statue was erected in his home town of Congleton in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Congleton", "response": ["* George Harold Eardley VC MM (1912\u20131991), received the Victoria CrossThe London Gazette, Publication date:29 December 1944, Supplement:36870, Page:139 retrieved December 2017 in 1944"]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["||George Harold Eardley || British Army || 1944 || Second World War ||  Overloon"]}, {"page": "King's Shropshire Light Infantry", "response": ["The 4th Battalion was a 1st Line Territorial Army (TA) unit assigned to the 159th Infantry Brigade, part of the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division.
