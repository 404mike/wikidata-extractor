Flockhart (1952\u20132015) was a Scottish medical researcher who was a leader in the field of personalised medicine.  He was especially known for his work on factors affecting the use of tamoxifen to treat breast cancer such as variability in the level of the CYP2D6 enzyme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Personalized medicine", "response": ["Physicians commonly use a trial and error strategy until they find the treatment therapy that is most effective for their patient. With personalized medicine, these treatments can be more specifically tailored by predicting how an individual's body will respond and if the treatment will work based on their genome. This has been summarized as \"therapy with the right drug at the right dose in the right patient.\" Such an approach would also be more cost-effective and accurate. For instance, Tamoxifen used to be a drug commonly prescribed to women with ER+ breast cancer, but 65% of women initially taking it developed resistance. After research by people such as David Flockhart, it was discovered that women with certain mutation in their CYP2D6 gene, a gene that encodes the metabolizing enzyme, were not able to efficiently break down Tamoxifen, making it an ineffective treatment for them. Women are now genotyped for these specific mutations to select the most effective treatment."]}, {"page": "David A.
