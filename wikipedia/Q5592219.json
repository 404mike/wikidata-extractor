He played for Durham and the Durham Cricket Board for the entirety of his first-class career. His debut came in the AXA County Championship in 1999, where he took the wicket of Gary Butcher. He never managed to establish himself on a regular basis and was released at the end of the 2006 season. Unable to find another club, he drifted away from the first-class game.\nHe plays in the North East Premier League for Blaydon Cricket Club, which he has captained. Despite many games being abandoned due to rain, he was a leading wicket taker in the 2007 season, as he has been in most seasons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Durham UCCE in 2005", "response": ["Despite Durham fielding a near first-string line-up, they were nowhere near dominant against the students, Durham making 277 on the first day after David Balcombe took five for 112.
