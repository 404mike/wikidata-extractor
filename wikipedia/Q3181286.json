The generic name Cirolana is an anagram of Carolina, named for an unknown woman called Caroline. Leach named a number of isopod genera with anagrams of Caroline or Carolina. In the French work in which Leach proposed these names he gave each new genus a French name as well as a Latin zoological name.  Sometimes - as with Cirolana - it was the French name that was the anagram of Caroline; in this case 'Cirolane'."]}, {"page": "John Cranch", "response": ["John Cranch may refer to:", "* John Cranch (naturalist) (1758\u20131816), English naturalist and explorer", "* John Cranch (American painter) (1807-1891), American painter", "* John Cranch (English painter) (1751\u20131821), English painter", "*John Cranch Walker Vivian"]}]}}
