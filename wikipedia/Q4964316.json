He is introduced wearing a greatcoat in World War II-set episodes, but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode \"Boom Town\" and black leather in futuristic episodes. Davies admits that this was a \"bit of a lame idea\" and decided that Jack \"never looked better than when he was in his World War II outfit\". From the pilot of Torchwood onwards, Harkness once again wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a Torchwood Magazine interview that \"We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour.\" Because the character was expected to \"be running around a lot\", Holman redesigned his RAF group captain's greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid and less \"weighty\". Jack's other costumes are \"loosely wartime based\", such as the trousers are \"getting more and more styled to suit his figure\". Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show. The \"hero version\" is used for most scenes, while there is also a wetcoat made with pre-shrunk fabric, running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught, and two \"stunt coats\" that had been \"hero coats\" in the first series.\" Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character \"likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity\". Julie Gardner describes the coat as \"epic and classic and dramatic\", while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack \"a sweep and a presence\"."]}, {"page": "Julian Nott", "response": ["|2009||Ingenious||Brian Kelly||TV movie"]}, {"page": "Day One (Torchwood)", "response": ["\"Day One\" is the second episode of the first series of the British science fiction television series Torchwood.

She believes that there's a palpable relationship between Gwen and Andy. Director Brian Kelly opines that it makes perfect sense for Andy to return in episode thirteen as \"he is the person who would phone Gwen\" in a crisis situation. Eve Myles, who portrays Gwen, believes that Price conveys the humorous aspects of Andy's character \"fantastically\", which enables her as an actress to understand the friendship between the characters. Myles also feels that Andy plays a crucial part in reminding viewers of Gwen's development; when he reappears \"it takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen\".
