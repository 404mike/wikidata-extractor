He started training with NWA-UK Hammerlock at the age of 14, under the guidance of Jon Ryan and Andre Baker.

In his early career, he made a name for himself as part of the \"Leaders Of The New School\" with Marty Scurll, holding the IPW:UK Tag Team Championships twice. He would later win the same title (now called RPW Undisputed British Tag Team Champions) alongside Suzuki-gun stablemate Minoru Suzuki. In Pro Wrestling Noah, he was a two-time GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion with Yoshinari Ogawa and, in World Xtreme Wrestling, a wXw World Tag Team Champion with Big Daddy Walter.

The wrestler then forces the opponent to one side, traps one of the opponent's arms with their own arm, and drapes their free leg over the neck of the opponent, forcing it downward. This elevates the wrestler and places all the weight of the wrestler on the opponent. The wrestler has one arm free, which can be used for balance. It was invented by  Antonio Inoki. AJ Lee and Katsuyori Shibata used this move as their finisher. Zack Sabre Jr. uses it as his submission finisher."]}, {"page": "Doug Williams (wrestler)", "response": ["After leaving TNA Wrestling, Williams began working for various independent promotions, most notably in United Kingdom.
