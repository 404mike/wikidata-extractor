According to Elizabeth Thompson, \u02bbUrabi's defense stressed the idea that despite the fact that he had been illegally incarcerated by Riyad Pasha and the Khedive Tewfik he had still responded in a manner allowed under Egyptian law and with the hopes that the khedivate remain after his intervention, thus demonstrating loyalty to the Egyptian people as required by his duties.Thompson, Elizabeth.

Sir William Francis Butler, GCB, PC (31 October 1838\u00a0\u2013 7 June 1910), a soldier, a writer, and an adventurer, lived in retirement at Bansha Castle from 1905 until his death in 1910. Sir William was born a few miles distant at 'Suirville', Ballyslatteen.  He took part in many colonial campaigns in Canada and India, but mainly in Africa, including the Ashanti wars and the Zulu War under General Sir Garnet Wolseley. He was made commander-in-chief of the British Army in South Africa in 1898, where he was also High Commissioner for a short period.  His views on colonialism were often controversial as he was sympathetic to the natives in many of the outposts of the British Empire in which he served. His wife, the famous battle artist, Elizabeth Thompson (1846\u20131933), known as Lady Butler, continued to live at the castle until 1922 when she went to live at Gormanston Castle, County Meath, with their youngest daughter, Eileen, who became Viscountess Gormanston (1883\u20131964) in 1911 on her marriage to The 15th Viscount Gormanston (1878\u20131925), the Premier Viscount of Ireland. Lady Butler died in 1933 in her 87th year and is buried at Stamullen Graveyard in County Meath, just up the road from Gormanston. Among her many famous paintings is The Roll Call depicting a scene in the Crimean War. This painting was bought by Queen Victoria and forms part of the Royal Collection and is now in Buckingham Palace. Her daughter Eileen suffered a great loss during the Second World War when two of her three sons, William, 16th Lord Gormanston, and Stephen were killed in action at Dunkirk (1940) and Anzio (1944) respectively. Both boys, together with their brother Robert and sister Antoinette, spent many childhood days at Bansha Castle where they were once marooned during the Irish Civil War when Bansha and the surrounding area was the cockpit for fighting between the Free State forces and the local Republicans.
