He was trained by William Aiton, a protege of Sir Joseph Banks and was Curator of the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens, Cambridge, from 1790 until his death. His most important work was Hortus Cantabrigiensis, first published in 1796 but with several later, much expanded, editions. It carried on past his death until 1845.A copy was given to the Library of the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University in 1895.He became a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1812.A memorial to James Donn, exists on St Edward the Martyr's church in Cambridge.A grandson was the English composer William Sterndale Bennett.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*James Donn (1758\u20131813),Abbreviation in botany: Donn English botanist, curator of the Cambridge University Botanic Gardens, and author of Hortus Cantabrigiensis"]}, {"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*James Donn"]}, {"page": "Lee Falk", "response": ["Falk's next large passion after cartooning was the theater and stage plays. During his lifetime, Falk ran five theaters, at one time or another, and he produced about 300 plays, and also directed about 100 of them. Falk wrote 12 plays, including two musicals: Happy Dollar and Mandrake the Magician, which were both based on his comic strip character. After Falk's death, his widow Elizabeth directed a musical called Mandrake the Magician and the Enchantress, which was written by Falk, and which was practically the same as his previous Mandrake the Magician musical. Some of his plays drew well-known actors and actresses such as Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, Celeste Holm, Constance Moore, Basil Rathbone, Chico Marx, Ethel Waters, Paul Newman, Ezio Pinza, James Mason, Jack Warner, Shelley Winters, Farley Granger, Eve Arden, Alexis Smith, Victor Jory, Cedric Hardwicke, Eva Marie Saint, Eva Gabor, Sarah Churchill, James Donn, Eddie Bracken, Ann Corio, Robert Wilcox and Paul Robeson to perform in them."]}, {"page": "Cambridge University Botanic Garden", "response": ["The Walkerian Garden was laid out and developed by the then professor of botany, Thomas Martyn. This small Garden was conceived as a typical Renaissance physic garden, inspired by the Chelsea Physic Garden in London. It grew herbaceous plants used in the teaching of medical students at the University. Glasshouses and a lecture room for the professor were built and the teaching of botany in Cambridge, which was then at a low ebb, received, for a time, a considerable stimulus. This improvement, however, did not last for long. Martyn left in 1798 and only visited Cambridge only occasionally until his death in 1825. About 1790 James Donn was appointed Curator and in 1796 he published the first edition of Hortus Cantabrigiensis, a list of the plants in the Garden which reached its 13th edition in 1845, long after Donn's death."]}, {"page": "Cuphea hyssopifolia", "response": ["The Latin specific epithet hyssopifolia (which also occurs in several other plant names, including that of Bassia hyssopifolia) means \"hyssop-leafed\",James Donn, Hortus Cantabrigiensis: or, a Catalogue of Plants, Indigenous and Exotic (1809), p. 5 referring to the fine, narrow leaves of that plant.
