He was a composition pupil of Louis Andriessen from 1989 to 1990. His work has often involved a deep engagement with the subject of memory, with the use of quotation of, or allusion to, other music, sometimes explicit, sometimes more buried. He has himself also spoken of his work in terms of 'turbulence seeking serenity'. Stylistically, this could be seen in the relationship between tonal and more dissonant materials in his music.\nKey works include the oboe concerto The Fabric of Dreams (2006), premiered by Nicholas Daniel and the Britten Sinfonia, The Impermanence of Things for piano, ensemble and electronics (2009), a London Sinfonietta commission, Allele for 40 voices (2010), a project involving the science of genetics, Bohortha  for large orchestra (2012), a BBC Symphony Orchestra commission, Seize the Day (2016), a Birmingham Contemporary Music Group Sound Investment commission, and his Violin Concerto (2017), a BBC Symphony Orchestra commission.\nGordon was the recipient of the Prix Italia 2004 for his composition for radio A Pebble in the Pond, and two British Composer Awards, for Allele and for This Night for choir and solo cello (2009), a commission for the choir of King's College, Cambridge. He has taught at the universities of Durham, Southampton and at the Royal College of Music. Since 2012 he has been Professor of Composition at the University of Birmingham. His music is published on Composer's Edition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Michael Zev Gordon || 1963 || || British || ||"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Daniel", "response": ["* The Fabric of Dreams by Michael Zev Gordon (2006) "]}, {"page": "Birmingham Contemporary Music Group", "response": ["2016: Michael Zev Gordon: Seize the Day"]}, {"page": "Michael Gordon", "response": ["* Michael Zev Gordon (born 1963), British composer"]}, {"page": "List of compositions for guitar", "response": ["*2000 Michael Zev Gordon (born 1963) Bells, Lachrimae and Stillness"]}, {"page": "Oboe concerto", "response": ["*Michael Zev Gordon"]}, {"page": "Andrew Zolinsky", "response": ["In the field of contemporary music Zolinsky has worked with Composers' Ensemble, Capricorn, Eos.
