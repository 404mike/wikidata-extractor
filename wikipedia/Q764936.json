He first visited China for the BBC in 1957.\nGreene later produced documentary films, including One Man's China, Tibet, Cuba va!, Vietnam! Vietnam! and Inside North Viet Nam. Right-wing critics have accused these films of presenting a one-sided view of communist society. The Wall Street Journal argued that Greene purposely hid negative information about the extent of starvation in China and called him a \"fellow traveller.\"Commander R.W. Herrick of the U.S. Navy reviewed A Curtain of Ignorance in Naval War College Review, writing, \"There can be no question but that [Greene] set out deliberately to 'prove' his contentions that practically everything having to do with Communist China and its policies is good, while Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist regimes are unmitigatedly bad. ... Yet, once the reader understands and allows for this bias, this book is eminently worth reading.\" Herrick agreed with Greene's observation that \"... on matters where great national feelings are aroused, scholars and experts are just as likely as the rest of us to allow their judgments to be swayed by the prevailing climate of opinion.\" He found the chapters on Nationalist China and the China Lobby to be provocative reading.In the 1970s, Greene went to Dharamsala to visit the 14th Dalai Lama, who recalled that after three days of discussion, Greene's attitude had changed.Greene was a cousin of the author Graham Greene. He lived in the San Francisco area for 20 years and died in Mexico of cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "One-child policy", "response": ["Deng Xiaoping, then paramount leader of China, supported the policy, along with other senior leaders including Hua Guofeng and Li Xiannian.

In the late spring of 1979, Chen became the first leader to propose the one-child policy, saying on 1 June that:Comrade Xiannian proposed to me planning \"better one, at most two\". I'd say be stricter, stipulating that \"only one is allowed\". Prepare to be criticized by others for cutting off the offspring. But if we don't do it, the future looks grim. On 15 October 1979, Deng met with a British delegation led by Felix Greene in Beijing,  saying that \"we encourage one child per couple. We give economic rewards to those who promise to give birth to only one child.\" The policy soon began to be enforced nationwide, with some exceptions made for ethnic minorities and rural families. In particular, Ma Yinchu was rehabilitated during the \"Boluan Fanzheng\" period. In 1982, the Third National Population Census showed that the population in China had reached 1 billion, and at the end of the year, family planning became a fundamental policy in China (\u57fa\u672c\u56fd\u7b56) as well as a constitutional duty."]}, {"page": "Far East Reporter", "response": ["*1973 April.
