This set up a unique power dynamic between the two sovereign states of Great Britain and Argentina. Some scholars have even argued that Argentina was a product of British imperialism. A. G. Hopkins explains that for imperialism to occur, the sovereignty of one state is being diminished by another state with more structural power. Susan Strange, an English political scientist, identified four main forms of structural power in her study States and Markets.  One of these is \"control over credit.\" For a developing nation it is clear that a free line of credit is essential to nation-building.  Capital is needed to build industries, and the Argentinians lost their line of credit when they declared independence from Bourbon Spain. Argentina as well as most of Latin America lacked the domestic capital to rebuild after the destruction of infrastructure during the revolutions.  Therefore, the City of London stepped in and funded the capital where Argentina could not.  In return for this foreign capital, the Argentinians were motivated to ensure political stability and keep the interests of the investors in mind."]}]}}
