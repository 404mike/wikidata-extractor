He developed \"Bradford's law\" (or the \"law of scattering\") regarding differences in demand for scientific journals. This work influences bibliometrics and citation analysis of scientific publications. Bradford founded the British Society for International Bibliography  (BSIB) (est. 1927) and he was elected president of International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID) in 1945. Bradford was a strong proponent of the UDC and of establishing abstracts of the scientific literature.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bradford's law", "response": ["Bradford's law is a pattern first described by Samuel C. Bradford in 1934 that estimates the exponentially diminishing returns of searching for references in  science journals. One formulation is that if journals in a field are sorted by number of articles into three groups, each with about one-third of all articles, then the number of journals in each group will be proportional to 1:n:n\u00b2. There are a number of related  formulations of the principle."]}, {"page": "List of scientific laws named after people", "response": ["| Bradford's law || Computer science || Samuel C.
