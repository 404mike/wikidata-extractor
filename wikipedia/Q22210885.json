On the eighth lap of the race, the inexperienced French amateur driver Ren\u00e9 Kippeurt lost control of his Bugatti T44 and it rolled several times, coming to rest in the middle of the road. German Fritz Roth, who closely followed, lost control of his BMW 328 #30, went off of the road and somersaulted. Kippeurt's body was thrown clear from his car, and was lying about 100 metres from the wreck. In an attempt to avoid Roth's car, Briton  Pat Fairfield crashed into Kippeurt's Bugatti. Fairfield's car was subsequently rammed by the Delahaye 135CS of Jean Tr\u00e9moulet which in turn was hit by the Talbot T150C driven by an Argentine count who raced under the pseudonym \"Raph\", and by the Riley TT Sprite of Raoul Forestier. An Adler driven by an unspecified German driver, was also involved in the accident. Kippeurt was killed instantly, Fairfield died in a hospital 2 days later and Tr\u00e9moulet was injured, as was Raph.
