His team started well, however midway through the campaign, following a run of five games without defeat, Coventry suddenly and unexpectedly hit a bad run of form. A 5\u20130 defeat at West Bromwich Albion began a sequence of eight games without a win, including six defeats. This culminated in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Bristol City in the FA Cup, a game which also saw a record low attendance at the Ricoh Arena. On 17 January 2007, the day after the cup exit, the club parted company with Adams, with Coventry lying 16th in the Championship. Adams stated that he intended to return to management as soon as possible. He admitted that the sale of Gary McSheffrey to Birmingham City had been a turning point in the club's season, but also said that \"I genuinely believe that I could have turned it around\" and \"I tried my best and that's all I can do.\""]}, {"page": "Nathan Tyson", "response": ["In July 2014, Tyson signed a one-year contract with League One club Doncaster Rovers after impressing on a three-week trial. He triggered a one-year contract extension in April 2015, and said he \"rediscovered his love for football\" playing under Paul Dickov. He scored a hat-trick on the last day of the 2014\u201315 season, in a 5\u20132 win over Scunthorpe United at the Keepmoat Stadium on 3 May.

He then scored seven goals in 36 games in the 2015\u201316 season as Rovers were relegated into League Two.
