Higgins was 0\u201359 down in that frame, but managed to compile an extremely challenging clearance during which he was scarcely in position until the colours. In particular, former world champion Dennis Taylor considers a three-quarter-ball pot on a blue into the green pocket especially memorable, not only for its extreme degree of difficulty but for enabling Higgins to continue the break and keep White off the table and unable to clinch victory at that moment. In potting the blue, Higgins screwed the cue-ball on to the side cushion to bring it back towards the black/pink area with extreme left-hand sidespin, a shot Taylor believes could be played 100 times without coming close to the position Higgins reached with cue-ball. He went a little too far for ideal position on his next red but the match-saving break was still alive.", "Higgins' funeral service was held at St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast, on 2 August 2010.

In Clive Everton's TV documentary The Story of Snooker (2002), Steve Davis described Higgins as the \"one true genius that snooker has produced\", although the autobiography of a contemporary leading professional Willie Thorne characterised Higgins as \"not a great player\". Higgins arguably fulfilled his potential only intermittently during his career peak in the 1970s and 80s; Everton puts this down to Davis and Ray Reardon generally being too consistent for him. O'Sullivan has called Higgins \"the greatest snooker player I have ever seen\" when he was playing at his best, while also acknowledging that Higgins's erratic lifestyle led to a lack of consistency on the table."]}, {"page": "World Snooker Championship", "response": ["Despite being the number thirteen seed, Steve Davis was the favourite for the 1981 championship.
