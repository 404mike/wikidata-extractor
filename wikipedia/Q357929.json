Critics felt it had caught the flavour of Britain in the 1950s and ushered in a new style of fiction.Malcolm Bradbury, 1989, p. 205; Ritchie, 1988, p. 64. By 1972, its impressive sales in Britain had been matched by 1.25 million paperback copies sold in the United States. It was translated into 20 languages, including Polish, Hebrew, Korean, and Serbo-Croat.Jacobs, 1995, p. 162. The novel won the Somerset Maugham Award for fiction and Amis became one of the writers known as the Angry Young Men. Lucky Jim was among the first British campus novels, setting a precedent for later generations of writers such as Malcolm Bradbury, David Lodge, Tom Sharpe and Howard Jacobson. As a poet, Amis was associated with The Movement."]}, {"page": "1942", "response": ["** Howard Jacobson, British novelist and journalist"]}, {"page": "Catch-22", "response": ["Catch-22 contains allusions to many works of literature.

S. Lowry", "response": ["Lowry joked about retiring from the art world, citing his lack of interest in the changing landscape. Instead, he began to focus on groups of figures and odd imaginary characters. Unknown to his friends and the public, Lowry produced a series of erotic works that were not seen until after his death. The paintings depict the mysterious \"Ann\" figure, who appears in portraits and sketches produced throughout his lifetime, enduring sexually charged and humiliating tortures. When these works were exhibited at the Art Council's Centenary exhibition at the Barbican in 1988, art critic Richard Dorment wrote in The Daily Telegraph that these works \"reveal a sexual anxiety which is never so much as hinted at in the work of the previous 60 years.\" The group of erotic works, which are sometimes referred to as \"the mannequin sketches\" or \"marionette works\", are kept at the Lowry Centre and are available for visitors to see on request. Some are also brought up into the public display area on a rotation system. Manchester author Howard Jacobson has argued that the images are just part of Lowry's melancholy and tortured view of the world and that they would change the public perception of the complexity of his work if they were more widely seen."]}, {"page": "Gerald Scarfe", "response": ["The cartoon was published in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, where Anshel Pfeffer discusses the cartoon in great detail, giving four reasons why, in his opinion, the cartoon is not antisemitic.Mark Gardner and Anshel Pfeffer \"Is the Sunday Times cartoon antisemitic?\" , The Guardian, 29 January 2013.
