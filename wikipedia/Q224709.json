The southbound party steadily reduced in size as successive support teams turned back. Scott reminded the returning Surgeon-Lieutenant Atkinson of the order \"to take the two dog-teams south in the event of Meares having to return home, as seemed likely\". By 4 January 1912, the last two four-man groups had reached 87\u00b034\u2032S. Scott announced his decision: five men\u2014himself, Wilson, Bowers, Oates and E. Evans) would go forward, the other three (Teddy Evans, William Lashly and Tom Crean) would return. The chosen group marched on, reaching the Pole on 17 January, only to find a tent left in place by Amundsen, in it containing a letter dated 18 December. Scott's anguish is indicated in his diary: \"The worst has happened\u00a0[...] All the day dreams must go\u00a0[...] Great God! This is an awful place\"."]}, {"page": "1940", "response": ["*June 12 - William Lashly, English sailor (b. 1867)"]}]}}
