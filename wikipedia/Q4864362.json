Johnston claimed not to have noticed saying anything odd during the match, and that he was only alerted to his gaffe by a letter from \"a lady\" named \"Miss Mainpiece\". According to Christopher Martin-Jenkins, his Cricinfo biography, and the biography by Johnston's son Barry, Johnston never actually made the remark. Barry Johnston says \"It was too good a pun to resist ... but Brian never actually said that he had spoken the words on air.\" Holding himself has expressed his doubt about the phrase ever being said, pointing out that no recording of it exists. Henry Blofeld and former TMS Producer Peter Baxter said that Johnston did not come up with the phrase and did not say it during commentary."]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born in the 20th century", "response": ["*Barry Johnston (born 1949), writer and producer"]}, {"page": "Oxford \"-er\"", "response": ["*Rodders for Rodney, as in the BBC radio comedy series, Beyond Our Ken (1958\u201364), when Hugh Paddick, playing the part of Charles, addressed his camp friend Rodney (Kenneth Williams): \"Absolutely dolly, Rodders\".Barry Johnston (2006) Round Mr Horne Rodney Trotter in Only Fools and Horses is often referred to as Rodders by his brother Del Boy."]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 5 (former)", "response": ["* Sunday Edition (with Barry Johnston)", "* Barry Johnston"]}, {"page": "Barry Alexander (songwriter)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Barry Johnston (writer)"]}, {"page": "Barry Johnston", "response": ["Barry Johnston may refer to:", "* Barry Johnston (footballer) (born 1980), Irish footballer", "* Barry Johnston (writer) (born 1949), British writer, audiobook producer, radio presenter and songwriter"]}]}}
