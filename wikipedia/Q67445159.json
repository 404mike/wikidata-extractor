She joined the London Society for Women's Suffrage but she did not get involved. By 1908 her father had retired and they moved to the Lake District where Marshall and her mother joined the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) and created the Keswick branch. Marshall was demonstrating what became best practice by establishing a stall in Keswick market to sell suffrage literature and raise awareness. In 1911, she joined the core group at the heart of the NUWSS working with Kathleen Courtney who had been elected honorary secretary. Catherine led the press department and represented the group at a meeting in Stockholm. When Edith Palliser was ill she took over as parliamentary secretary skilfully inspiring local groups to lobby their M.P.s whilst she applied direct pressure to key figures. Palliser resigned and Marshall took on her role. The NUWSS was effectively led by Courtney and Marshall. Marshall was involved with senior Liberal party politicians who claimed to support women's suffrage but in effect did little. In August 1913, she returned to Keswick and stayed until the following February."]}, {"page": "Second Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance", "response": ["The meeting was called to order on 3 June at the Prince Albert Hotel by American Susan B.
