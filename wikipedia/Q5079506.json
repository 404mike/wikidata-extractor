He trained as a musician and was elected in a 1906 by-election to the London County Council, representing the Walworth division of Newington. Jesson represented Walworth on the LCC until he stood down in 1919.\nJesson also became an organiser for the Amalgamated Society of Musicians (later to become the Musicians' Union). The Musicians' Union supported the National Democratic and Labour Party in the 1918 general election and Jesson was elected for Walthamstow West as one of nine NDP MPs supporting the Coalition Government of David Lloyd George.\nThe NDP broke up in 1922 when its leader George Nicoll Barnes retired from Parliament, and along with the remaining other NDP MPs Jesson joined the National Liberal Party. He contested Walthamstow West at that year's general election as a National Liberal, but was defeated by the Labour Party candidate Valentine McEntee and did not stand for Parliament again.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
