In January 1891 a fire destroyed much of the building complex at Downton College including Wrightson's home as well as the collection of botanical, zoological and geological specimens collected over many years by Professor Ernest Clarke, a member of the academic staff. A firm believer in education for all, Wrightson was very involved in life in Downton village and taught children at the local state school."]}, {"page": "Samuel Tymms", "response": ["Samuel Tymms (27 November 1808, Camberwell - 29 April 1871 Lowestoft) was an English antiquarian, topographer, printer and publisher.
