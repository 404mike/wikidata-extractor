Due to its location, it could get direct reports about developments in Indonesia. According to Duncan Campbell, Indonesia had used sabotaged cypher machines supplied by the Swiss company Crypto AG which had built-in back doors for GCHQ and the CIA, allowing them to decode and read secret Indonesian messages \"without difficulty\". With its spies based in Singapore, Britain took advantage of a failed coup by the 30 September Movement that resulted in the murder of six senior Indonesian generals. The British encouraged the Indonesian Army campaign of mass killings after the attempted coup, through spreading anti-Communist propaganda and material. Such content was used to inflame and encourage the destruction of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). Hundreds of thousands of members of the PKI were murdered. According to Norman Reddaway the GCHQ material at Chia Keng could have helped Indonesian generals to persecute the PKI. This was done to undermine Sukarno and his government and to try to end the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, a conflict over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia. The conflict ended after Sukarno relinquished his power to Suharto."]}, {"page": "Reddaway", "response": ["*Norman Reddaway (1918\u20131999), British civil servant and diplomat"]}]}}
