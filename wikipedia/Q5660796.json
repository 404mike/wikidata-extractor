He retained his place for the rest of the season, but did not set the world alight. However, the next year was another matter, as he scored four hundreds, including an unbeaten 200 against the West Indians in July. In this year, he was capped by his county: the first cap Worcestershire had awarded.\nHe continued to play a key role for his county up until the Second World War, forging a very useful opening partnership with Cyril Walters in the early 1930s. Most years Gibbons averaged in the thirties, and in 1933 he passed 2,000 runs in a season for the first time, but in 1934 he had the best summer of his career, scoring 2,654 runs at 52.03 with eight centuries; this remains the highest season's aggregate for the county.\nIndeed, a purple patch in late May and early June of that year produced successive scores of 93, 7, 88, 104, 157, 70*, 100 and 129.\nNever again did Gibbons quite reach the heights of 1934, although he did pass 2,000 runs once more, when averaging 43.26 in 1938. The following year he recorded his career-best innings when he hit 212 not out against Northamptonshire, but the Second World War intervened, and though he returned to play three matches for Worcestershire in 1946, he was not a success and his career came to an end.\nGibbons scored first-class hundreds against all the other counties with the single exception of Somerset. Nevertheless, he was never capped by England, and had to content himself with appearances for the Players and the North of England, both in 1928, as well as a benefit season ten years later.\nHe died in Worcester at the age of 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1934 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Harold Gibbons 2,654 @ 52.03 (HS 157)"]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": [":1928: Harold Gibbons", "|Harold Gibbons || 20,918", "*Most runs in a season: 2,654 by Harold Gibbons, 1934"]}, {"page": "Cyril Walters", "response": ["The following year Walters became captain of Worcestershire, and he advanced steadily despite his team falling off and two very wet summers, scoring over 1,500 runs in 1932 including 190 against Warwickshire. However, it was not until 1933 that Walters entered the front rank of batsmen. Whereas he had hit only one century in each of his first three seasons at Worcestershire, that year he hit a county-record nine centuries. With the Nawab of Pataudi, Maurice Nichol and Harold Gibbons Walters gave Worcestershire a quartet of batsmen who contributed twenty-five centuries between them. Although Worcestershire won only two games because of deplorable bowling, with Herbert Sutcliffe suffering a surprise decline, Walters was chosen to open the batting in all three Tests against the touring West Indians. With scores of 51 and 46 in the first two Tests he did not disappoint, and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden for 1934. In the following series in India Walters definitely established himself as England's first choice opening bat, averaging 71 for six innings."]}, {"page": "Harold Gibbons", "response": ["Harold Gibbons may refer to:", "*Harold Gibbons (cricketer), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "1973 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 February \u2013 Harold Gibbons, English cricketer (born 1904)"]}, {"page": "Maurice Nichol", "response": ["but in 1928 (having not yet qualified to play in the County Championship) he made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against the touring West Indians at Worcester.

Like Northants, they were perennial strugglers and picked up five wooden spoons. There was an improvement in 1939 when they won more than they lost for once and finished seventh. Their best batsmen were Harold Gibbons, Maurice Nichol and Cyril Walters. The Nawab of Pataudi was on their books in the 1930s but he only played one full season for them, 1933, when he scored 1,749 runs. Fred Root was the mainstay of the Worcestershire bowling through the 1920s when they also had the all-rounder Frederick Pearson. In the 1930s, Worcestershire's best bowlers were George Brook, Dick Howorth, Peter Jackson, Reg Perks and Sidney Martin. Syd Buller, later well known as a Test umpire, kept wicket for Worcestershire in the 1930s."]}]}}
