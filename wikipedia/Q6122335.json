When asked if she shared any similarities with Tilly, Dixon thought she was loyal like her and shared her positive attitude. She also believed that they were both generous and saw the good in the people around them. Tilly is a studious character and loves to read, which has rubbed off on Dixon."]}, {"page": "Callum Kane", "response": ["Callum was portrayed as loyal, moody and clever. He was not into socialising and did not care what anyone else thought of him. Duncan thought Callum was a bit of a mystery, especially as he was introverted and often preferred to spend his time reading and watching European cinema. Duncan was pleased when Callum's family were introduced, as they helped to give an insight into why Callum is the way he is. Callum got on well with his sisters, but had a difficult relationship with his alcoholic mother Martha (Carli Norris). Other storylines saw Callum befriend homeless student George Smith (Steven Roberts), embark on a relationship with Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman) and almost dying after being shot during a robbery. The character was well received by critics.", "Callum's first love interest was Maddie Morrison (Scarlett Bowman). In an November 2011 interview published in OK!, Bowman confirmed that Maddie and Callum would grow closer and she branded them \"an unlikely couple\". The actress said Maddie would really fall for Callum and show her vulnerability at the same time. In the same interview, Duncan said Callum was not desperate for a relationship, due to being introverted, but he becomes \"alluring\" to the girls. When Callum and Maddie go head-to-head in a college debate, there are \"sparks\" between them. During a night out, Maddie tries to make Callum jealous by flirting with Joel Dexter (Andrew Still), but when her evening ended badly, Callum came to her rescue and they ended up sharing their first kiss. Duncan thought Callum and Maddie made a good match, despite their different personalities. He told Kilkelly that Maddie brought out Callum's fun side, while Callum tried to help Maddie escape the image she was hiding behind and make her less bitchy. Duncan thought Callum would not be happy if he caught Maddie being rude to people and believed Callum would definitely let Maddie know about his feelings.", "Callum first appears where he starts Hollyoaks sixth form college, he is seen as quiet and weird.
