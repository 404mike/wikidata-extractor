The Dunn estate, like much of the philanthropy world, was beginning to look more to \"preventive\" philanthropy (as opposed to direct aid to the needy) by sponsoring research institutions that could address social ills.  Between 1919 and 1925, Fletcher convinced the Dunn trustees to put nearly half a million pounds toward biomedical research.Kohler, From medical chemistry to biochemistry, pp. 76-79"]}, {"page": "Sir William Dunn, 1st Baronet, of Lakenheath", "response": ["After handing out a large number of small grants to hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, etc., the trustees decided on a grander scheme.

Around the same time, Thomas Harrison Montgomery Jr. described the morphology of the nucleolus, an organelle within the nucleus, which has subsequently been shown to form through intracellular phase separation. WB Hardy linked formation of biological colloids with phase separation in his study of globulins, stating that: \"The globulin is dispersed in the solvent as particles which are the colloid particles and which are so large as to form an internal phase\", and further contributed to the basic physical description of oil-water phase separation."]}]}}
