He played club level rugby union (RU) for Llanelli RFC. He played representative level rugby league (RL) for Wales and Lancashire, and at club level for Swinton (two spells), and Leigh, and representative level association football for Wales, and at club level for Bolton Wanderers, as a goalkeeper. Dai Davies is the only person to have appeared in both the rugby league Challenge Cup Final and the association football FA Cup Final, and is one of the very few, perhaps the only, footballer to play for Wales at both international association football and international rugby league.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
