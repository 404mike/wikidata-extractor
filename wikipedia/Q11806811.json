In 1934, Macmillan had dedicated part of an address on \"Law and History\" to Murray: May I in passing pay a tribute to the memory of my old friend? Few men in recent times have contributed more to legal learning than did Dr Murray. He demonstrated by his own career the fallacy of the idea that scholarship is inimical to professional success, for while few if any have surpassed him in antiquarian learning, he was no mere pedant but an admirable man of business and the head of one of the most important legal firms in Scotland. I am happy in remembering the stimulus which he gave to my early legal studies and, with no less gratitude, the fact that I received from him my first general retainer \u2013 for the old Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company.Murray's extensive private legal practice permitted him to amass one of the greatest private libraries ever to exist in Scotland. His daughter, Sylvia, estimated that it contained some 40,000 items. Murray left the majority of his library to Glasgow University, where they continue to exist as the Murray Collection, forming about 23,000 items.Glasgow University Library, Murray Collection  It was with the materials in his unrivalled library that Murray spent all his leisure hours, resulting in an extensive and wide-ranging scholarly output on law, economic and legal history, accountancy, archaeology, and bibliography.
