The father of the Bishop is sometimes claimed to be a fourth century Praetorian prefect of Gaul named Aurelius Ambrosius, whose areas included Britain, though some modern scholars doubt that Saint Ambrosius was related to this man (instead identifying his father with an official named Uranius mentioned in an extract from the Theodosian Code).Barnes, T. D., \"The Election of Ambrose of Milan\", in: Johan Leemans (ed), Episcopal Elections in Late Antiquity, de Gruyter, 2011, pp 39\u201360.Mazzarino, S. \"Il padre di Ambrogio\", Helikon 13\u201314, 1973\u20131974, 111\u2013117.Mazzarino, S., \"Storia sociale del vescovo Ambrogio\", Problemi e ricerche di storia antica 4, Rome 1989, 79\u201381. Ashley suggests that Ambrosius Aurelianus was related to the two Aurelii Ambrosii. Tim Venning points out that the name \"Aurelianus\" could be the result of a Roman adoption. When a boy was adopted into a new gens (clan), he received the family names of his new family but was often additionally called by a cognomen indicating his descent from his original family. The additional cognomen often had the form \"-anus\". When Gaius Octavius from gens Octavia was adopted by his uncle Gaius Julius Caesar, he was often distinguished from his adoptive father by the addition \"Octavianus\". In this case, Ambrosius may have been a member of gens Aurelia who was adopted by another gens/family.", "Mike Ashley suggests that the descendants of Ambrosius could include other people named by Gildas. He favours the inclusion in this category of one Aurelius Caninus (\"Aurelius the dog-like\"), whom Gildas accuses of parricide, fornication, adultery, and warmongering. His name \"Aurelius\" suggests Romano-British descent. The insulting nickname \"Caninus\" was probably invented by Gildas himself, who similarly insults other contemporary rulers. Due to the name used by Gildas, there are theories that this ruler was actually named Conan/Cynan/Kenan. Some identify him with Cynan Garwyn, a 6th-century King of Powys, though it is uncertain if he was a contemporary of Gildas or lived one or two generations following him. Another theory is that this ruler did not reign in Britain but in Brittany. Caninus, in this view, might be Conomor (\"Great Dog\"). Conomor is considered a likelier contemporary of Gildas. Conomor was likely from Domnon\u00e9e, an area of Brittany controlled by British immigrants from Dumnonia. He might be remembered in British legend as Mark of Cornwall."]}, {"page": "E. T. A.

But historical mystery stories remained an oddity until the late 1970s, with the success of Ellis Peters and her Cadfael Chronicles (1977\u20131994), featuring Benedictine monk Brother Cadfael and set in 12th century Shrewsbury. Umberto Eco's one-off The Name of the Rose (1980) also helped popularize the concept, and starting in 1979, author Anne Perry wrote two series of Victorian era mysteries featuring Thomas Pitt (1979\u20132013) and William Monk (1990\u20132013). However it was not until about 1990 that the genre's popularity expanded significantly with works such as Lindsey Davis's Falco novels (1989\u20132010), set in the Roman Empire of Vespasian; John Maddox Roberts's SPQR series (1990\u20132010) and Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa novels (1991\u20132010), both set in the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC; and Paul Doherty's various series, including the Hugh Corbett medieval mysteries (1986\u20132010), the Sorrowful Mysteries of Brother Athelstan (1991\u20132012), and the Canterbury Tales of Mystery and Murder (1994\u20132012).

In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later.Magazine publishing dates for the period are tabulated in Ashley, History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 3, pp.\u00a0323\u2013325. Galaxy appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.Ashley, Transformations, pp.\u00a024, 72\u201373.", "The cover for the first issue was by David Stone, depicting a scene from Simak's Time Quarry. The image was muted, in contrast to the sensational art typically found on the covers of the sf pulps; the intention was that Galaxy should look like an sf  magazine, but one \"that you were not embarrassed to hold\", in the words of Mike Ashley.  The early artwork was generally unremarkable, though Ed Emshwiller's humorous cover for the June 1951 issue, his first professional sale as an artist, was a positive sign. \"Emsh\", as he was known to science fiction readers, soon became a regular contributor.Ortiz, Emshwiller, p.\u00a031  The relatively expensive production processes that Gold had insisted on enabled more sophisticated internal artwork, which could be integrated with type in ways not possible with cheaper letterpress printing.Frederik Pohl, \"Introduction\", in Pohl, Greenberg & Olander, Galaxy: Thirty Years of Innovative Science Fiction, p.\u00a0xiv.", "Ejler Jakobsson's tenure began with a large backlog of stories that Pohl had acquired, but within a year or two substantial changes were apparent.  In the early 1970s, Jakobsson attempted to update Galaxy image, adding a comic strip, \"Sunpot\", by Vaughn Bod\u00e9, for example. Theodore Sturgeon took over from Budrys as the regular book reviewer in January 1972 and held the post until mid-1975. Jakobsson did not manage to give Galaxy a new and distinctive character: \"Sunpot\" lasted only four issues, Sturgeon's reviews were undistinguished, and many of the new authors he published have been, in the words of Mike Ashley, \"mercifully unknown ever since\".Tymn & Ashley, Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines, p.\u00a0302.  The paper quality and printing quality also dropped, and early cover designs were very weak.  Jakobsson initially printed guest editorials rather than writing his own; when he took over the editorial page his work was unremarkable.  He managed to attract some of the new writers who were becoming well known in the sf scene, including George R.R. Martin, Joe Haldeman, and Joanna Russ.  Three novels published in Jakobsson's Galaxy won awards: Isaac Asimov's The Gods Themselves and Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama each won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, in 1972 and 1973 respectively, and Robert Silverberg's A Time of Changes won the Nebula in 1971.

Editors Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas had approached Spivak in the mid-1940s about creating a fantasy companion to Spivak's existing mystery title, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine.  The first issue was titled The Magazine of Fantasy, but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy, and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue.  F&SF was quite different in presentation from the existing science fiction magazines of the day, most of which were in pulp format: it had no interior illustrations, no letter column, and text in a single column format, which in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley \"set F&SF apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine\".", "Boucher and McComas's original goal for the new magazine was to imitate the formula that had made Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine successful: classic reprints, along with quality fiction that avoided the excesses of the pulps.  The initial proposal called for the magazine to include fantasy, but not science fiction.  Even before the launch, the editors found they were having trouble deciding exactly where the boundary lay, so when in February 1949 Joseph Ferman, Spivak's general manager, asked them to add sf to the lineup as a way to broaden the readership, they were happy to comply.  The first issue included only one story that could be called science fiction: Theodore Sturgeon's \"The Hurkle Is a Happy Beast\"; it also included reprints from the slick magazines by writers such as Richard Sale, and Guy Endore.  The interior layout was quite different from the existing fantasy and sf magazines: there were no interior illustrations, and the text was printed in a single column, instead of two as was usual elsewhere.

According to sf historian Mike Ashley, this \"set F&SF apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine\".Ashley (2005), pp. 21\u201322.  The logo design and layout were the work of Mercury Press's art director, George Salter, whose background was in book design rather than in pulp magazines.  Salter remained with the magazine until 1958.  He was responsible for many of the surreal early covers; these gave way to work by other artists, but his design for F&SF remained intact for decades, and in Ashley's opinion the consistency of appearance has been \"one of the major selling points\" of the magazine.Ashley (2007), p. 10."]}, {"page": "Herne the Hunter", "response": ["*The villainous Master Forester in Sarban's novel The Sound of His Horn (1952) is an incarnation of Herne the Hunter.Mike Ashley, John Clute, Peter Nicholls, \"Sarban\" The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. 12 August 2018.

He published some conventional stories in the British magazines, but over the next few years Ballard's more traditional science fiction material appeared mostly in the American market, with Science Fantasy and New Worlds reserved for more experimental material that was a harbinger of New Wave science fiction.

The magazine is generally regarded as the finest fantasy fiction magazine ever published, despite the fact that it was not commercially successful, and in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley it was responsible for the creation of the modern fantasy publishing genre.", "In May 1923, the first issue of Weird Tales appeared, from Rural Publications in Chicago. Weird Tales was a pulp magazine that specialized in fantasy stories and material that no other magazine would accept. It was not initially successful, but by the 1930s had established itself and was regularly publishing science fiction (SF) as well as fantasy.Robert Weinberg, \"Weird Tales\", in Tymn & Ashley, Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines, pp.\u00a0727\u2013736.  Weird Tales was the first magazine to focus solely on fantasy, and it remained the pre-eminent magazine in this field for over a decade.Ashley, Time Machines, p.\u00a041.  In the meantime, science fiction was starting to form a separately marketed genre, with the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine edited by Hugo Gernsback. In 1930 pulp publisher Clayton Publications launched Astounding Stories of Super Science,Ashley, Time Machines, p.\u00a069. but the company's bankruptcy in 1933 led to the acquisition of the magazine by Street & Smith.Ashley, Time Machines, p.\u00a082. The title was shortened to Astounding Stories, and it became the leading magazine in the science fiction field over the next few years under the editorship of F. Orlin Tremaine.Ashley, Time Machines, pp.\u00a084\u201385.Albert I. Berger & Mike Ashley, \"Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact\", in Tymn & Ashley, Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines, pp.\u00a060\u2013103. At the end of 1937, John W. Campbell took over as editor.", "Campbell's plans for Unknown were laid out in the February 1939 issue of Astounding, in the announcement of the new magazine. He argued that \"it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... [Unknown] will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term\". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's Sinister Barrier, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by SF historian Mike Ashley as \"a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy\".Ashley, Time Machines, pp.\u00a0140\u2013141. Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in Ashley's words, Campbell \"brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy\".  The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's \"Trouble with Water\", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, \"Trouble with Water\" was a better indication than Sinister Barrier of the direction Unknown would take.  Campbell commented in a letter at the time that Sinister Barrier, \"Trouble with Water\", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.Chapdelaine, John W. Campbell Letters, p.\u00a044.", "Under Campbell's editorial supervision, the fantasy element in Unknown stories had to be treated rigorously.  This naturally led to the appearance in Unknown of writers already comfortable with similar rigor in science fiction stories, and Campbell soon established a small group of writers as regular contributors, many of whom were also appearing in the pages of Astounding.  L. Ron Hubbard, Theodore Sturgeon, and L. Sprague de Camp were among the most prolific.  Hubbard contributed eight lead novels including  Typewriter in the Sky, Slaves of Sleep, and Fear, described by Ashley as a \"classic psychological thriller\"; SF historian and critic Thomas Clareson describes all eight as \"outstanding\". De Camp, in collaboration with Fletcher Pratt, contributed three stories featuring Harold Shea, who finds himself in a world where magic operates by rigorous rules.Mike Ashley, Unknown, in Clute & Grant, Encyclopedia of Fantasy, p.\u00a0974. The title of one of these, \"The Mathematics of Magic\", is, according to SF critic John Clute, \"perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention in Unknown\".John Clute, \"Lyon Sprague de Camp\", in Clute & Grant, Encyclopedia of Fantasy, pp.\u00a0257\u2013258.", "thumb|right|Cover for the February 1942 issue\u00a0\u2013 an example of the more dignified cover layout that was adopted in July 1940Other Astounding writers who wrote for Unknown included Robert A. Heinlein, whose \"The Devil Makes the Law\" (reprinted as \"Magic, Inc.\") depicts a world where magic is a part of everyday life. Heinlein also contributed \"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag\" and \"They\", described by Ashley as \"perhaps the ultimate solipsist fantasy\".Mike Ashley, \"Robert A. Heinlein\", in Clute & Grant, Encyclopedia of Fantasy, p.\u00a0406. A.E. van Vogt, a frequent Astounding contributor, appeared in the final issue with \"The Book of Ptath\" (later expanded into a novel).  Isaac Asimov, despite multiple attempts to write for Unknown, never appeared in the magazine.  On his sixth attempt, he sold \"Author! Author!\" to Campbell, but the magazine was canceled before it could appear.Asimov, In Memory Yet Green, pp.\u00a0380, 390.
