He has played in the Football League for York City and Crawley Town.\nOyebanjo started his career with West Ham United's youth system and after being released joined Waltham Forest in 2006. He spent one season with the Isthmian League Division One North club before joining League Two team Brentford in 2007. Having not made any first-team appearances for Brentford, Oyebanjo dropped into the Conference Premier with Histon in 2008. He helped Histon to the play-off semi-final in his first season, but after their relegation to the Conference South in 2011 he remained in the Conference Premier with York City. Oyebanjo scored York's second goal in their 2012 FA Trophy Final victory and then played in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final, which the team won to earn promotion to League Two. Having been voted York's Clubman of the Year for the 2013\u201314 season, he signed for League One team Crawley Town in 2014. They were relegated to League Two in 2014\u201315, and Oyebanjo was released a year later. He returned to York in 2016, who were newly relegated to the National League, before being released a year later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Daniel Parslow", "response": ["Parslow started 2011\u201312 out of the team, with McGurk and Smith preferred in central defence. He appeared twice at right-back in the first two months of the season when Lanre Oyebanjo was absent, before falling behind Jon Challinor and Jamal Fyfield for a place in defence. Parslow was used mostly as a substitute from then before a run starting in central defence in late December 2011, before losing his place after the signing of Chris Doig in February 2012. He was restored to the starting line-up in early March 2012 due to other defenders being unavailable, before Doig once again took his place in the team. He returned to the starting line-up in early April 2012 due to Smith's absence and started 10 of York's last 11 fixtures of the season. Parslow won the 2012 FA Trophy Final with York at Wembley Stadium on 12 May 2012, in which they beat Newport County 2\u20130. Eight days later, he played in the 2\u20131 victory over Luton in the 2012 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, seeing the club return into the Football League after an eight-year absence with promotion into League Two. He completed 2011\u201312 with 38 appearances for York, after which he signed a new one-year contract with an option to extend in June 2012."]}, {"page": "Black people in Ireland", "response": ["* Lanre Oyebanjo, footballer (Nigerian father)"]}]}}
