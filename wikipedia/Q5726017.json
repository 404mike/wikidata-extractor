He was re-elected in three further general elections (unopposed in 1857 and 1859), but was defeated at the 1865 general election.At the 1868 general election he stood in the two-seat Monmouthshire county constituency, a county where owned he a large house called Llantilio Court, at Llantilio Crossenny, near Abergavenny, having inherited it in 1847 from a cousin.\nHowever, Monmouthshire had been a solidly Conservative seat since 1841, and in the constituency's first contested election since the Reform Act 1832, Morgan-Clifford came a poor third behind the two Conservative candidates.Morgan-Clifford's heir and only surviving child was his daughter Marion, who married James Fitzwalter Butler (1839\u20131899), the 15th and 25th Baron Dunboyne. In 1860 they changed their surname by royal licence to Clifford-Butler.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Morgan (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Henry Morgan-Clifford (1806\u20131884), English Liberal Party Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Hereford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Henry Morgan-Clifford"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Henry Morgan-Clifford||Liberal"]}, {"page": "1884 in Wales", "response": ["*12 February \u2013 Henry Morgan-Clifford, politician, 77"]}, {"page": "Commissioners in Lunacy", "response": ["*Henry Morgan-Clifford"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1857 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|Hereford(two members)||Henry Morgan-Clifford||Liberal"]}, {"page": "Sir Henry Jackson, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["His address was listed in 1881 as Llantilio Court, Abergavenny, Monmouthshire.
