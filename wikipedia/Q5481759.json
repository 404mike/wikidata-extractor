He wrote a two-volume regimental history of the Norfolk Regiment, but is best known for his works on the Napoleonic Wars. The grandson of the 11th Baron Petre, he was educated at Oscott College and joined the Bar in 1880. He took the civil service exam and subsequently joined the Indian Civil Service. He retired as Commissioner of Allahabad in 1900.\nSubsequently, he chose a literary career, pursuing interests in the history of the Napoleonic Wars.  He wrote five books on the Wars, most of which are in use a century later. His studies of Napoleon's conquest of Prussia 1806\u20131807 (1901) and Napoleon's Campaign in Poland, 1806\u20131807 (1901) were among the first such books in the English language.
