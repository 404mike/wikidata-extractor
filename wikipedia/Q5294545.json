Williamson rejecting \"the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor.\"Controversial caterpillar-evolution study formally rebutted, Scientific American Online Williamson's paper provoked immediate response from the scientific community, including a countering paper in PNAS. Conrad Labandeira of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History said, \"If I was reviewing [Williamson's paper] I would probably opt to reject it,\" he says, \"but I'm not saying it's a bad thing that this is published. What it may do is broaden the discussion on how metamorphosis works and ... [on] ... the origin of these very radical life cycles.\" But Duke University insect developmental biologist Fred Nijhout said that the paper was better suited for the \"National Enquirer than the National Academy.\" In September it was announced that PNAS would eliminate communicated submissions in July 2010. PNAS stated that the decision had nothing to do with the Williamson controversy."]}, {"page": "Tunicate", "response": ["* Donald I.

Williamson, published a controversial paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (via Academy member Lynn Margulis through a unique submission route in PNAS that allowed members to peer review manuscripts submitted by colleagues), wherein Williamson claimed that the caterpillar larval form originated from velvet worms through hybridogenesis with other organisms, giving rising to holometabolan species.

The adult form was not observed until 1969 to be that described by Carl Wilhelm Erich Zimmer in 1904, and only in 1973 was Amphionides placed in its own order by Donald I. Williamson. The specific epithet reynaudii was given by Henri Milne-Edwards in honour of a friend of his, possibly Count Fran\u00e7ois Dominique Reynaud de Montlosier. The generic name used by Milne-Edwards, Amphion, was invalid as a junior homonym of Amphion H\u00fcbner, 1819, a genus of hawk moths."]}, {"page": "Donald Williamson", "response": ["*Donald I.
