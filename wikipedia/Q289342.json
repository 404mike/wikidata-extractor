She is known for her role in the feminist art movement and especially for reversing traditional gender roles in her paintings of nude men, often using conventional female poses from historical paintings by male artists like Diego V\u00e9lazquez, Titian, and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Her most well-known subjects were art critics, feminist artists, and her husband, Lawrence Alloway.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timeline of art", "response": ["* 2010 in art - Death of Kenneth Noland, Elaine Hamilton-O'Neal, Robert Natkin, Purvis Young, Deborah Remington, Giuseppe Panza, Avigdor Arikha, Craig Kauffman, Shusaku Arakawa, Dennis Hopper, Lester Johnson, Louise Bourgeois, Sigmar Polke, Paul Thiebaud, Doug Ohlson, Nicolas Carone, Corneille, Ralph T.

Movements included the fight for equality for women with a focus on sexuality, reproductive rights, the family, and the workplace. Artists and historians began to investigate how images in Western art and the media, were often produced within a male narrative and particularly how it perpetuated idealisations of the female subject. The questioning and interrogation of the overarching male gaze within the historical art narrative, manifested in both critical writing and artistic practice, came to define much of the mid to late 20th century art and erotic art. American Art Historian Carol Duncan summarises the male gaze and its relationship to erotic art, writing \u201cMore than any other theme, the nude could demonstrate that art originates in and is sustained by male erotic energy. This is why many \u2018seminal\u2019 works of the period are nudes.\u201d Artists such as Sylvia Sleigh is an example of this reversal of the male gaze as her work depicts male sitters presented in traditional erotic reclining poses that usually were reserved for the female nude as part of the \u2018odalisque\u2019 tradition."]}, {"page": "Brooklyn Museum", "response": ["In 2002, the museum received the work The Dinner Party, by feminist artist Judy Chicago, as a gift from The Elizabeth A.

In his review of a group show at SOHO20 called Showing Off (1975), Perreault characterized Sharon Wybrants's Self-Portrait as Superwoman (Woman as Culture Hero) (1975) as \"more than slightly tongue-in-cheek.

For example, her wood cutout of Princess Margarita from Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's Las Meninas is the same size as a real child. Sills's cutout of the young subject from \u00c9douard Manet\u2032s The Fifer (1994; Rowan University Art Gallery, Sylvia Sleigh Collection) is also the same size as a real child.
