After moving onto Brookside Close, he asked his partner Sam (Dinah May) to marry him; while she refused his offer, she did agree to live with him. Later, Sam asked Alan to marry her; however, when the day came, she jilted him and left for Los Angeles.  Alan then got together with his former partner Liz.  After Alan got into trouble for plagiarism after helping Gordon Collins (Nigel Crowley) sell one of his computer programmes, he realised Liz was behind it and threw her out.  In revenge for this, Liz arranged for Alan to be attacked and he was viciously assaulted. When Sam returned from Los Angeles, she and Alan got back together. They married on 17 July 1984. After marrying, they left and moved to Kuwait."]}, {"page": "The Optimist (TV series)", "response": ["File:The_Optimist_Season_One,_Los_Angeles_1982_actors.jpg|Christine Garner, Terri Robinson, Dinah May and Carinthia West on location in Los Angeles, July 1982, for the shoot of The Optimist, series one"]}]}}
