In 1971 his mother abruptly emigrated with him to England, where he ultimately became a prominent filmmaker. Ida is his first Polish film; in an interview he said that the film \"is an attempt to recover the Poland of my childhood, among many things\". Ida was filmed in Poland with a cast and crew that was drawn primarily from the Polish film industry. The film received crucial early funding from the Polish Film Institute based on a screenplay by Pawlikowski and Rebecca Lenkiewicz, who is an English playwright. Once the support from the Polish Film Institute had been secured, producer Eric Abraham underwrote production of the film.", "The film was criticized by Polish nationalists for its perspective on Christian\u2013Jewish relations in Poland. A letter of complaint was sent by the right-wing Polish Anti-Defamation League to the Polish Film Institute, which provided significant funding for the film. A petition calling for the addition of explanatory title cards was signed by more than 40,000 Poles; the film does not explicitly note that thousands of Poles were executed by the German occupiers for hiding or helping Jewish Poles. Eric Abraham, one of the producers of Ida, responded \"Are they really suggesting that all films loosely based on historical events should come with contextual captions? Tell that to Mr. Stone and Mr. Spielberg and Mr. von Donnersmarck,\" which refers to the directors of JFK, Lincoln, and The Lives of Others."]}, {"page": "Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards", "response": ["|2019 || Kinky Boots || Eric Abraham and The Fugard Theatre"]}, {"page": "Shakespeare in Love (play)", "response": ["In 2017, the first South African production of the play took place at The Fugard Theatre (Cape Town, South Africa).

Hermanus, whose family were affected by Apartheid, was initially skeptical of the white focus of the film, but found the memoir eye-opening and saw its potential to challenge. A few drafts later, he got to work on the script himself, widening the scope to examine the hate politics and toxic white masculinity that Apartheid tried to indoctrinate into a generation of men, both agents and property of the state, using Nicholas as a point of view.
