Symons was the son of Russian-born Jewish immigrants. He was a self-educated man who in his youth had been apprenticed as a furrier.\nIn 1922, he founded the First Edition Club to publish limited editions and to organize exhibitions of rare books and manuscripts. In 1924 he published a bibliography of first editions of the works of Yeats, and in 1930 he founded the Book Collector's Quarterly. He was an authority on writers and editions of the 1890s, and he published An Anthology of 'Nineties Verse in 1928.\nSymons completed his first biography, Emin, Governor of Equatoria, in 1928. In 1933 he brought out a biography of the explorer H. M. Stanley. Neither created much of a stir. In 1934, however, Symons published his masterpiece, The Quest for Corvo, a biography of the English author and eccentric Frederick Rolfe (the self-styled Baron Corvo). Subtitled \"An experiment in biography,\" The Quest for Corvo was a groundbreaking work: rather than being a simple narrative of a life, it describes an author's search for understanding of his subject, revealing aspects of Rolfe's life and character as they are revealed to the author. Though it appears entirely natural, the work is very skillfully orchestrated. The result is a vivid, prismatic portrait of Rolfe, those who knew him, and of Symons himself.\nA dandy and an epicure, Symons devoted much of his energy to fine living. In 1933, he founded the Wine and Food Society with Andr\u00e9 Simon. In 1936, his marriage of twelve years to Gladys Weeks ended in divorce. In 1939 he fell ill, suffering from partial paralysis. He died in 1941 of a tumour of the brainstem.\nSymons wrote with difficulty and sought help in the study of psychoanalysis. He left several unfinished works, including a long-contemplated biography of Oscar Wilde, at his death. His author brother Julian Symons (1912\u20131994) published his biography in 1950.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frederick Rolfe", "response": ["Rolfe's life provided the basis for The Quest for Corvo by A. J. A. Symons, an \"experiment in biography\" regarded as a minor classic in the field. This same work reveals that Rolfe had an unlikely enthusiast in the person of Maundy Gregory.", "Rolfe's early books were politely reviewed but none of them was enough of a success to secure an income for its author, whose posthumous reputation began to dim. Within a very few years, however, coteries of readers began to discover a common interest in his work, and a resilient literary cult began to form.  In 1934 A. J. A. Symons published The Quest for Corvo, one of the century's iconic biographies, and this brought Rolfe's life and work to the attention of a wider public. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a further surge of interest in him which became known as \"the Corvo revival\", including a successful adaptation of Hadrian for the London stage. Two biographies of Rolfe appeared in the 1970s. These led to his inclusion in all the major works of reference and engendered a stream of academic theses on him. Although his books have remained in print, no substantial monograph has ever appeared in English on his work.There is one work in Italian: Carla Marengo Vaglio, Frederick Rolfe Baron Corvo, Mursia, 1969. With the growing academic interest in the history of literary modernism and acknowledgement of the central importance of life writing in its genesis, the true importance of Rolfe\u2019s autobiographical fictions has come into focus.  His influence has been discerned in novels written by Henry Harland, Ronald Firbank,See David Dougill, 'Firbank: A Long Look', in Books and Bookmen, Vol 18, May 1973, p.36. Dougill appends to his article a short bibliography of the evidence for the influence of Rolfe on Firbank. Graham Greene,Greene's biographer claimed that Pinkie, the protagonist in \"Brighton Rock\", was based on Rolfe. See Norman Sherry, \"The Life of Graham Greene\": Volume One 1904\u20131939, Jonathan Cape, 1989, p.645. and Alexander Theroux,See Steven Moore, \"Alexander Theroux's Darconville's Cat and the Tradition of Learned Wit,\" Contemporary Literature 27.2 (Summer 1986): 235. and in his coinage of neologisms and use of the Ulysses story there is some perhaps coincidental prefiguring of the work of James Joyce.The similarities between the work of Rolfe and Joyce were first remarked upon by Stuart Gilbert: \u2018Had the Fates been kinder, that unhappy genius might have moved parallel, if on a somewhat lower plane, to Joyce\u2019s. Nicolas  Crabbe\u2026had a good deal in common with Stephen Dedalus.' (James Joyce's Ulysses: A Study, Faber, 1952, p.95)."]}, {"page": "Augustus Theodore Bartholomew", "response": ["His work on Frederick Rolfe had a somewhat less happy ending. In 1918 he set about gathering material for a possible biography of the eccentric author, who had died in Venice in 1913. He compiled a scrapbook of material from various sources, including Rolfe's publisher Grant Richards, the uranian poet Horatio Brown (who had lived in Venice for much of his life) and Rolfe's family. But A. J. A. Symons, founder of the First Edition Club, published a piece on Rolfe in 1926 which focused on the more scandalous aspects of his life, and for reasons which are unknown, Bartholomew eventually gave up on his projected biography. At Bartholomew's death his precious scrapbook (now at the Harry Ransom Center in Texas) was lent to Symons, who used it extensively for his 1934 biography of Rolfe, entitled Quest for Corvo."]}, {"page": "Julian Symons", "response": ["Julian Symons was born in London to a Russian or Polish-born father (Alphonse Maurice Brann) and an English mother (Minnie) of French and Spanish antecedents.

He founded the poetry magazine Twentieth Century Verse in 1937, editing it for two years. \"He turned to crime writing in a light\u2013hearted way before the war and soon afterwards established himself as a leading exponent of it, though his use of irony to show the violence behind the respectable masks of society places many of his books on the level of the orthodox novel.\"The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Penguin Books, 1985; .

After a period as an advertising copywriter, he became a full-time writer in 1947. During his career he won two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America and, in 1982, received the MWA's Grand Master Award.

Symons (no relation to Simon's wife), a dilettante in the publishing trade whom Simon had met some years earlier. On 20 October 1933, the two established the Wine & Food Society, with Simon as President (and Editor of the Society journal, Wine and Food), and Symons as Secretary handling the business side. The Society held its first banquet at the Savoy in January 1934. With the ending of Prohibition in the United States in 1933, Simon made his first trip to North America the following year. On 11 December 1934, he founded in New York City a branch of what would become the International Wine & Food Society, and branches across the US, Australia and South Africa soon followed. His great friend Symons died of a brain haemorrhage on 26 August 1941, and Simon took over control of the Society from that point.
