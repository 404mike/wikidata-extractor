John Fernald directed him once again in London, playing Razumikhin, with Kenneth Griffith as Raskolnikov, in Crime and Punishment.

Michael Benthall offered him a season at The Old Vic, but only small parts and understudying were on offer,  except for a stint at the 1954 Edinburgh Festival as Donalbain in Macbeth, with Paul Rogers and Ann Todd in the leading roles.  In 1955, when Regent's Park Open Air Theatre offered him the chance to play Ferdinand in The Tempest,  Amer persuaded Benthall to release him. He played Ferdinand for a second time, this time with Robert Eddison as Prospero and James Maxwell as Ariel, and with June Bailey as Miranda,  and then on alternate nights playing Percinet opposite Hilda Schroder in Rostand's The Romanticks (Les Romanesques),  with character actors Russell Thorndike and Robert Atkins as the two fathers. He also performed Shakespeare live on TV, including playing Sebastian in BBC Sunday Night Theatre's Twelfth Night (1957) with Dilys Hamlett as Viola in a production by Michael Elliott and Caspar Wrede.
