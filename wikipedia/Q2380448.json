A wealthy collector, Hewitson was particularly devoted to Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and, also, to birds' nests and eggs. His collection of butterflies, collected by him as well as purchased from travellers throughout the world, was one of the largest and most important of his time. He contributed to and published many works on entomology and ornithology and was an accomplished scientific illustrator.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oology", "response": ["*William Chapman Hewitson, Illustrations of Eggs of British Birds, (third edition, London, 1856)."]}, {"page": "Oatlands, Surrey", "response": ["*William Chapman Hewitson (1806\u20131878), Naturalist and lepidopterist.
