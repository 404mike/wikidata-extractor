The sisters, Charlotte (1816\u20131855), Emily (1818\u20131848), and Anne (1820\u20131849), are well known as poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers, they originally published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories immediately attracted attention for their passion and originality. Charlotte's Jane Eyre was the first to know success, while Emily's Wuthering Heights, Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and other works were later to be accepted as masterpieces of literature.\nThe three sisters and their brother, Branwell (1817\u20131848), were very close and during childhood developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play set in an intricate imaginary world, and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set therein. The deaths of first their mother, and then of their two older sisters marked them profoundly and influenced their writing, as did the relative isolation in which they were raised. The Bront\u00eb birthplace in Thornton is a place of pilgrimage and their later home, the parsonage at Haworth in Yorkshire, now the Bront\u00eb Parsonage Museum, welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anne Bront\u00eb", "response": ["In summer 1824 Patrick sent daughters Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, and Emily to Crofton Hall in Crofton, West Yorkshire, and subsequently to the Clergy Daughter's School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire.Fraser, The Bront\u00ebs, p. 35 Maria and Elizabeth Bront\u00eb died of consumption on 6 May and 15 June 1825 respectively, and Charlotte and Emily were brought home. The unexpected deaths distressed the family so much that Patrick could not face sending them away again. They were educated at home for the next five years, largely by Elizabeth Branwell and Patrick.Fraser, The Bront\u00ebs, pp. 44\u201345 The children made little attempt to mix with others outside the parsonage and relied on each other for company. The bleak moors surrounding Haworth became their playground. Anne shared a room with her aunt, Elizabeth. They were close, and she may have influenced Anne's personality and religious beliefs.G\u00e9rin, Anne Bront\u00eb, p. 35"]}, {"page": "Sara Pezzini", "response": ["Former wielders of the Witchblade include Saren (a fictional Artemis-esq wood nymph goddess of Sumerian religion, and who was the uninterested object of Gilgamesh's unrequited lust, and was hunted by Enkidu), Cathain (based on Sc\u00e1thach of Irish & Scottish legend, and lover of Conchobar), Joan of Arc, Florence Nightingale (although she was not of the wielder's bloodline), and Elizabeth Bront\u00eb (an American spy in WWII), along with unidentified Egyptian, Babylonian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese and Celtic woman (all with the same face as Sara Pezzini) throughout human history.", "Sara finds herself trying to figure out the origins of the weapon she now carries, as well as the purpose that is destined for her. Her nemesis is businessman Kenneth Irons, whose bodyguard Ian Nottingham is implied to be his son. In the television series, it turns out that while Ian, via Kenneth's experiments, is also related to Sara; Ian was created from the stem cell of Elizabeth Bront\u00eb, a former wielder from Sara's bloodline (possibly her biological grandmother) and it is implied that they could be genetically related. Ian is obsessed with Sara, but his erratic behavior disturbs her. In the second season, he meets Aras, a woman genetically identical to Sara (a biological cousin of hers from about five generations back), and they share a kiss. Sara has a friend named Gabriel Bowman who has a website called Talismaniac and is knowledgeable about mythology and artifacts."]}, {"page": "Crofton, West Yorkshire", "response": ["*Elizabeth Bront\u00eb (1815\u20131825) was briefly educated at Crofton Hall School."]}]}}
