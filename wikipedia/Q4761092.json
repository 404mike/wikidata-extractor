Joe arrives as a young fresher in Hollyoaks studying fashion and got himself in a bit of a bother with roommate Robbie Flynn (Andy Newton-Lee), after the pair had a falling out over room sharing. Joe certainly had his share of attention and was fleetingly labelled as gay. This brought a few admirers like Nick O'Connor (Darren Bransford), after he too thought Joe was gay.", "Robert \"Robbie\" Flynn, played by Andy Newton-Lee, made his first appearance on 23 September 2003. He was a cheeky student who was also stubborn, hot-headed and set in his ways. Robbie preferred to have his own space and found the prospect of sharing a room in his halls of residence distinctly unappetising after a mistake by the admin, had him sharing a room with Joe Spencer. The two battled with each other hoping to get the other one to move out, this lasted a while as the two kept on winding each other up and getting back at one another, but they eventually decided to give up the war and become friends. Robbie found some love interest after he managed to sleep with Student President Chloe Bruce. According to Joe, Robbie moved to Ibiza to become a Holiday rep."]}]}}
