Spohr also wrote 105 songs and duets, many of them collected as Deutsche Lieder (German Songs), as well as a mass and other choral works.  Most of his operas were little known outside of Germany, but his oratorios, particularly Die letzten Dinge (1825\u20131826) were greatly admired during the 19th century in England and America. This oratorio was translated by Edward Taylor (1784\u20131863) and performed as The Last Judgment in 1830 for the first time. During the Victorian era Gilbert and Sullivan mentioned him in act 2 of The Mikado in a song by the title character."]}, {"page": "William Taylor (man of letters)", "response": ["Three early poetic translations from German brought him to notice. Georg Herzfeld wrongly assigned to him the political song, The Trumpet of Liberty, first published in the Norfolk Chronicle on 16 July 1791, having been sung on 14 July at a dinner commemorating the fall of the Bastille; Edward Taylor claimed it for his father, John Taylor, of the unrelated Norwich family. William Taylor's name was made by his translation of Gottfried August B\u00fcrger's Lenore into English ballad metre. This was written in 1790, and bore the title Lenora; sent it to his friend Benzler from Detmold (then in Wernigerode); a previous version had been made in 1782 by Henry James Pye, but was not published till 1795, and was unknown to Taylor. The translation, circulated in manuscript, was made the foundation of a ballad (1791) by John Aikin, and was read by Anna Barbauld in 1794 at a literary gathering in the house of Dugald Stewart in Edinburgh. Stewart's brother-in-law, George Cranstoun (Lord Corehouse) gave his recollection of it to Walter Scott, who produced his own version (1796) of the poem, entitled William and Helen. The announcement of the almost simultaneous publication of Scott's version and three others had led Taylor to publish his in the Monthly Magazine in March 1796; he then published it separately as Ellenore, revised with some input from the version by William Robert Spencer."]}, {"page": "Edward Taylor (disambiguation)", "response": ["Edward Taylor (c. 1642\u20131729) was a colonial American poet, physician, and pastor.", "Edward Taylor may also refer to:", "* Edward Taylor (music writer) (1784\u20131863), English singer, writer on music, and Gresham Professor of Music", "* Edward Taylor (scriptwriter) (born 1931), writer of the BBC radio comedy series The Men from the Ministry", "* Edward Taylor (MP for Canterbury) (1774\u20131843), British politician", "* Edward Taylor (priest) (1921\u20131982), Archdeacon of Warwick", "* Edward Taylor (rugby union) (1907\u20131959), Scottish rugby player", "* Edward Taylor (cricketer) (1845\u20131902), English cricketer", "* Edward Taylor (Alamo defender) (1812\u20131836)"]}, {"page": "Gresham Professor of Music", "response": ["| 17 || Edward Taylor || 24 October 1837"]}, {"page": "Octagon Chapel, Norwich", "response": ["Originally built as a Presbyterian Chapel, the building now serves the Unitarian Community.
