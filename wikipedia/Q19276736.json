Critic Alan Dent noted that \"the one exception among the general cowed lethargy of the Barretts is Elizabeth herself...she is sincere, touching, awakened.\"Obituary: Margaret Johnston, Daily Telegraph, 2 July 2002. Retrieved 21 July 2010", "Johnston returned to the screen via the unexpected medium of the horror film Night of the Eagle (1962). It was a successful film, but was not to Johnston's personal taste. She later stated: \"I hated that. It was popular, but it wasn't the sort of film I enjoyed doing.\" She then appeared in Girl in the Headlines (1963) and Life at the Top (1965), which was more to her liking. (\"I did enjoy that. My character was a slut...who wore terrible, loose, awful suits and had a lot of dogs around her.\") Her penultimate screen appearance was in a detective drama The Psychopath (1966) and her final acting role in any medium was Sebastian (1968), another role she said she disliked, which she had only accepted as a favour to producer Michael Powell.Margaret Johnston @ IMDb.com Retrieved 21 July 2010"]}, {"page": "World Indoor Bowls Championships", "response": ["|  Margaret Johnston"]}, {"page": "1991 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Margaret Johnston.
