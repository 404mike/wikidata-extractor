Curtis was introduced as the show's \"handsome new technician\" who was billed as a \"baby-faced\", \"charming churchgoer\" who is \"a sweet man at first\", with a \"charming exterior\" that covers \"a time-bomb ticking away\". He was teased to have a \"secret past\" that \"comes back to haunt him\". Curtis formed a relationship with Alice Chantrey (Sam Grey), which hit turmoil when Curtis' past was explored. Grey described Curtis as \"a reformed bad boy\" with \"a past\". Curtis departed at the end of the twenty-third series, broadcast on 1 August 2009. Curtis was killed off and died as a result of his injuries after falling from the hospital roof. The Daily Mirror's Jim Shelley criticized Alice's relationship with Curtis, deeming it \"about as convincing as Stacey Slater's with Bradley, or Corrie's Maria and Tyrone\", lacking in plausibility as: \"Alice had gone from being so virginal and meek she was practically mute to marrying a youth the police claimed used to be 'a serious player'.\"", "Jessica gradually recovers but she and Adam drift further apart, leading to her departure to America with an old school friend, Linda Andrews (Christine Tremarco) which leaves Adam devastated. He becomes increasingly reckless, having a one-night stand with young vulnerable HCA Alice Chantrey (Sam Grey) and inviting himself into a patient's house after work one night. Adam then begins a false relationship with the patient's mother, hoping to relive the paternal feelings he had for his own son, Harry, and Jessica's two other children. After this relationship disintegrates, Adam spirals further into depression."]}, {"page": "Sam Grey (disambiguation)", "response": ["Sam Grey is a British actress.", "Sam Grey  may also refer to:", "*Sam Grey (All My Children), a fictional character in the U.S. TV soap opera All My Children", "* Sam Grey, a fictional character of the 1939 film, Star Reporter, portrayed by Eddie Kane"]}, {"page": "Sam Grey (actress)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Grey "]}, {"page": "Brother Nature (film)", "response": ["* Sam Grey as John Adams"]}, {"page": "Grey, Sam", "response": ["#redirectSam Grey"]}]}}
