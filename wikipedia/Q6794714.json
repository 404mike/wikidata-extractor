He is part of the Cape Farewell Climate Change project. He studied painting and graphic art at Newton Abbot Art School and then went on to gain a BA in Fine Art (1969\u20131972) at Middlesex University (formerly Hornsey School of Art). He is a sculptor (kinetic), musician and composer. His primary instrument is a unique electro-acoustic monochord, developed from an aeolian sculpture. 'The Arc' consists of a single string stretched lengthwise across a long piece of wood (around ten feet) which can be played with a bow, fingers or short glass rods. The end of the instrument has a microphone attached so the basic sound can be amplified, recorded and run through sound effect programs.\nEastley has collaborated with many different artists and musicians on performances, installations and recordings including: David Toop,  Brian Eno, Paul Burwell, Victor Gama, Hugh Davies, Steve Beresford, Peter Greenaway, Dave Hunt, David Buckland, Evan Parker, Peter Cusack, Spaceheads. From 2001\u20132002, Eastley was a visiting fellow at John Moores University Liverpool and is currently (2010 onwards) an AHRC research fellow at Oxford Brookes University researching Aeolian phenomena. On 17 May 1989, Eastley was awarded a prize in the 'Learning Spaces Category' of the working in the City European Communities Architectural Ideas Competition (University College Dublin).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Incus Records", "response": ["|, Paul Burwell, Hugh Davies, Max Eastley, Paul Lovens, Paul Lytton, Annabel Nicolson, Evan Parker"]}, {"page": "The Marble Index", "response": ["Peter Buckley noted Nico's use of psychedelic drugs during the Summer of Love as an influence on the album's music, and Jim DeRogatis described it as \"minimalist bad-trip psychedelia\".frieze called The Marble Index the \"bridge between the New York Minimalists of the late 1960s and Brian Eno's ambient records of the late 1970s\".
