Paul Du Noyer wrote in his review for Blender in 2004: \"Their talent was already a source of wonder, but now the songs themselves were turning mysterious. Under the influence of Bob Dylan \u2013 and, it might be said, marijuana \u2013 the Fab Four laced their tunefulness with new introspection, wordplay and social comment.

Writing for PopMatters that year, David Medsker said that Revolver showed the four band members \"peaking at the exact same time\", and he deemed it to be \"the best of the bunch, the letter that went unanswered\" among a series of reciprocally influential musical statements exchanged between the Beatles and the Beach Boys over 1965\u201367. In a 2007 appraisal of the band's albums, Henry Yates of Classic Rock magazine paired it with Sgt. Pepper's as the two \"essential classics\" in the Beatles' canon and described it as \"Always the rock fraternity's favourite (and the blueprint for Noel Gallagher's career)\". Writing in Paste, Mark Kemp says that the album \"completed [the Beatles'] transformation from the mop tops of three years earlier into bold, groundbreaking experimental rockers\", while Paul Du Noyer, in a review for Blender, said that it marked the group's arrival as \"psychedelic gurus\" and was a work in which the Beatles \"revolutionized their own style and rock music itself ... with the boldest innovations of the band's career\"."]}, {"page": "Van Morrison", "response": ["With his next album, the new decade found Morrison following his muse into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews.Heylin (2003), page 364.Rogan (2006), page 330. In February 1980, Morrison and a group of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later \"Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product.\"Hinton (1997), page 230.Heylin (2003), page 365. The album, Common One, consisted of six songs; the longest, \"Summertime in England\", lasted fifteen and a half minutes and ended with the words,\"Can you feel the silence?\". NME magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album \"colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak.\" Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: \"It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be.\" Morrison insisted the album was never \"meant to be a commercial album.\" Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: \"He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality.\" Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of \"Summertime in England\". Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, \"Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics.\""]}, {"page": "Magical Mystery Tour", "response": ["In his review for Blender, Paul Du Noyer writes: \"They lost the plot with their dopey TV film, but 1967 was still their zenith as songwriters. For once, the U.S. release went better than the British original ... The result was simply the best set of Beatles tunes so far on a single disc.\" AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger opined that the psychedelia was \"even spacier in parts\" than on Sgt. Pepper, but \"there's no vague overall conceptual/thematic unity to the material, which has made Magical Mystery Tour suffer slightly in comparison. Still, the music is mostly great.\" Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork describes the EP-exclusive tracks as \"low key marvels\". He says that while the album lacks a progressive quality from the band's previous work, it \"is quietly one of the most rewarding listens in the Beatles' career\", and the mixed nature of the collection \"matters little when the music itself is so incredible\"."]}, {"page": "Hey Jude", "response": ["The single was a highly successful debut for Apple Records, a result that contrasted with the public embarrassment the band faced after the recent closure of their short-lived retail venture, Apple Boutique. In the description of music journalist Paul Du Noyer, the song's \"monumental quality ... amazed the public in 1968\"; in addition, the release silenced detractors in the British mainstream press who had relished the opportunity to criticise the band for their December 1967 television special, Magical Mystery Tour, and their trip to Rishikesh in early 1968. In the US, the single similarly brought an end to speculation that the Beatles' popularity might be diminishing, after \"Lady Madonna\" had peaked at number 4.", "In his 1996 article about the single's release, for Mojo, Paul Du Noyer said that the writing of \"Hey Jude\" had become \"one of the best-known stories in Beatles folklore\". In a 2005 interview, Ono said that for McCartney and for Julian and Cynthia Lennon, the scenario was akin to a drama, in that \"Each person has something to be totally miserable about, because of the way they were put into this play. I have incredible sympathy for each of them.\" Du Noyer quoted Cynthia Lennon as saying of \"Hey Jude\", \"it always bring tears to my eyes, that song.\""]}, {"page": "Astral Weeks", "response": ["\"Sweet Thing\" is the only song on the album to look forward instead of backward. In the words of AllMusic: \"Over the endlessly descending, circular progression, Morrison sings positive lyrics about nature and a romantic partner, seemingly beginning in the middle of a thought: 'And I will stroll the merry way. Paul Du Noyer wrote, \"Sweet Thing puts the singer in a hazy, pastoral paradise where he wanders in 'gardens wet with rain', or counts the stars in his lover's eyes, and vows to 'never grow so old again' or 'read between the lines'. He pleads with his mind to keep quiet, so his heart can hear itself think. He yearns to obliterate experience and rediscover innocence.\" It has been a more popular cover song than any of the others on the album and is the only Astral Weeks song that has been included in any of Morrison's compilation albums."]}, {"page": "Christ \u2013 The Album", "response": ["Reviewing the album in NME, Paul Du Noyer wrote: \"There's always something exciting about such raw passion; anger which hits you so hard that every idea in your head gets shook up, violently.\""]}, {"page": "The Joshua Tree", "response": ["Qs Paul Du Noyer said that the source of The Joshua Trees \"potency lies in a kind of spiritual frustration \u2013 a sense of hunger and tension which roams its every track in search of some climactic moment of release, of fulfilment, that never arrives.\" He concluded his review by writing that the music \"has the one thing vital to worthwhile rock, a thing so often absent: the urge to exist\". Spin hailed the record as U2's \"first wholly successful album because it finally breaks free from the seductive but limiting chant-and-drone approach of earlier material\". The review stated, \"There isn't a bad song on the record\" and that \"every one has a hook\". The magazine praised U2 for eschewing ambient experimentation in favour of uncomplicated but layered arrangements. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album \"confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago\u2014the greatest rock and roll band in the world\". Hilburn noted that the band showed \"sometimes breathtaking signs of growth\" and played more \"tailored and assured\" music. Hot Press editor and longtime U2 supporter Bill Graham said that \"The Joshua Tree rescues rock from its decay, bravely and unashamedly basing itself in the mainstream before very cleverly lifting off into several higher dimensions,\" and that U2 \"must be taken very seriously indeed after this revaluation of rock\". John Rockwell of The New York Times was complimentary of the band for expanding its musical range but said Bono's vocals were \"marred throughout by sobbing affectation\" and sounded too much like other singers, resulting in a \"curious loss of individuality\". The Houston Chronicles Marty Racine felt it has \"music that both soothes and inspires, music that is anthemic, music with style\". Racine, however, believed the group took itself too seriously, resulting in a record that is \"not a whole lot of fun, bordering on the pretentious\", which caused him to lose interest by the second side. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice found the lyrics tasteful and the music \"mournful and passionate, stately and involved\", but lamented what he felt was pompous singing by Bono, calling it \"one of the worst cases of significance ever to afflict a deserving candidate for superstardom\"."]}, {"page": "Avant-garde music", "response": ["Avant-garde music may be distinguished from experimental music by the way it adopts an extreme position within a certain tradition, whereas experimental music lies outside tradition.David Nicholls, American Experimental Music, 1890\u20131940 (Cambridge [England] and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990): 318.

He concluded, \"For an album that wasn't meant to be an album, it's quite an album.\" Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it \"captured the anxious, even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour\" so much so that \"it stands as the first tour album that doesn't include any of the songs from the tour\" and yet sounds like a \"souvenir\" of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe called the album a \"creative stretch\", noting that the band experimented more yet retained their recognizable sound. He commented that the group's \"yearning anthemic reach\" and \"obvious, slinky pop charm\" were replaced with \"darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness\". Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a \"freewheeling feel of going with the flow\" throughout the album and calling it \"rootless and loose, restless and unsettled\".
