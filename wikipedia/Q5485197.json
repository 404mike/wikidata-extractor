Frank Barnwell was taken on as the design engineer for this project, and took over as Bristol's chief designer when Coand\u0103 left the company in October 1914.

Rothermere became aware of Bristol's proposal and, in response to his inquiry, on 3 March 1934, Barnwell issued him with a quote of the specification and performance statistics of the design, including an estimated top speed of  at . By this point, proposed use of the Aquila engine had been shelved in favour of the supercharger-equipped, poppet-valve Bristol Mercury engine. Deeming it suitable for the issued challenge, the design of Type 135 was further adapted to produce the Type 142 in order to meet the requirements outlined by Rothermere. In late March 1934, Rothermere placed an order for a single Type 142 aircraft, under which he paid for half of the estimated \u00a318,500 cost up front and the remainder upon the aircraft's first flight in the following year."]}, {"page": "List of aerospace engineers", "response": ["* Frank Barnwell (1880\u20131938) \u2013 chief engineer, Bristol Aeroplane Company"]}, {"page": "1938 in aviation", "response": ["* August 2 \u2013 Bristol Aeroplane Company chief designer Frank Barnwell dies when the Barnwell B.S.W. \u2013 an airplane he designed and built privately \u2013 he is piloting stalls and crashes on takeoff from Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport in Bristol, England."]}, {"page": "Bristol Bulldog", "response": ["The design of the Bulldog was the outcome of a series of design studies for fighters undertaken by Frank Barnwell during the 1920s. In 1924 Barnwell had started work on a fighter powered by the Rolls-Royce Falcon to meet the requirements of specification F.17/24.  The project was shelved since Bristol preferred to use its own engine designs, but was revived in 1926 when Barnwell started work on a design, designated the Bristol 102, to meet either F.9/26 for a day-and-night fighter or N.21/26 for a shipborne fighter.  The Type 105 designation was first applied to a subsequent proposal for another aircraft to meet F.9/26 powered by the Mercury engine then under development at Bristol.  These proposals looked promising enough for a pair of mockups to be constructed for inspection by the Air Ministry in February 1927. The two aircraft were similar in design, the interceptor to specification F.17/24 design being slightly smaller and lighter and not equipped with radio. As a result, Bristol was asked to revise the design so that it met a later interceptor specification, F.20/27.  Subsequently, a prototype aircraft, now designated the Type 107 Bullpup was ordered for evaluation, but the other design did not gain official backing.  Nevertheless, Bristol considered it promising enough to build a prototype to be entered for the F.9/26 trials as a private venture, powered by a Bristol Jupiter because the supply of Mercurys was expected to be limited.Barnes 1964, p. 212."]}, {"page": "Bristol F.2 Fighter", "response": ["The Bristol F.2 Fighter was a British two-seat biplane fighter and reconnaissance aircraft of the First World War developed by Frank Barnwell at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. It is often simply called the Bristol Fighter, other popular names include the \"Brisfit\" or \"Biff\".", "Several new types were developed; the Royal Aircraft Factory offered its R.E.8 design and Armstrong Whitworth produced the design that eventually emerged as the F.K.8. In March 1916, Frank Barnwell of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, commenced work on a replacement for the B.E.2. This initially took two forms, the Type 9 R.2A, to be powered by the 120\u00a0hp Beardmore engine and the similar Type 9A R.2B, powered by the 150\u00a0hp Hispano-Suiza.Barnes 1970, p. 104.Bruce 1965, p. 97. Both designs had the fuselage mounted between the wings, with a gap between the lower longerons and the wing, along with a substantial part of the fin beneath the fuselage. These features were intended to improve the field of fire for the observer; the positioning of the fuselage also resulted in the upper wing obscuring less of the pilot's field of view. The crew positions were placed as close together as possible, to help communication between the pilot and observer."]}, {"page": "James McCudden", "response": ["Before returning to France, McCudden met with Frank Barnwell and Harold Barnwell, the sibling chief engineers at Vickers Limited, with whom he exchanged information on aircraft design and operations. The brothers gained a greater appreciation of the pilot's perspective. After watching him fly the F.B.9, the brothers were convinced of his skill and consequently McCudden was invited to fly several of their products. Among these machines was the Vickers F.B.16. McCudden claimed to have reached 136\u00a0mph (219\u00a0km/h) in the aircraft, describing it as a \"nice bus\".Cole 1967, p. 93. Other pilots noted it was faster than the French SPAD and the S.E.5. On the strength of this evaluation Vickers approached the War Office for front line use. It was not selected for production. McCudden believed the unavailability of the engine was a main factor in its rejection."]}, {"page": "List of University of Glasgow people", "response": ["* Frank Barnwell, aeronautical engineer and pilot of first powered flight in Scotland in 1909"]}, {"page": "Scottish inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* Aircraft design: Frank Barnwell (1910) Establishing the fundamentals of aircraft design at the University of Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Bristol Type 143", "response": ["The Bristol Type 143 was a British twin-engine monoplane aircraft designed by Frank Barnwell of the Bristol Aeroplane Company.", "Like the better-known Type 142 the Type 143 arose from the unbuilt Bristol Type 135 proposal for a civil twin-engine light transport aircraft. This was a low-wing twin-engined monoplane, seating six people and a crew of two, first sketched out by Frank Barnwell, with the intention of using the smaller of the two engines then being developed by Roy Fedden, the Aquila I. Although the manufacture of a second Aquila was authorised, nothing was done about the construction of an actual airframe.Barnes 1964, p. 257. Meanwhile, in early 1934 Lord Rothermere announced his intention to have 'the fastest civil aircraft in Europe' built for him. Barnwell proposed an aircraft based on the type 135 but using the more powerful Mercury engine in place of the Aquila, and this was accepted by Rothermere, the aircraft being ordered on 26 March 1934 and first flying on 12 April 1935.Barnes 1964, pp. 257\u2013258."]}, {"page": "Balfron", "response": ["* Harold and Frank Barnwell, known as the Barnwell Brothers, were also from Balfron.

The design was initially given the works number SN.183, inherited from a cancelled design for the Italian government undertaken by Henri Coanda, the half-finished fuselage of which remained in the workshops and the drawings for the aircraft bore this number.Barnes 1970, p.91", "Numbers 229 and 230, later designated the Scout B when Frank Barnwell retrospectively gave type numbers to early Bristol aircraft, were identical to the modified Scout A, except for having half-hoop-style underwing skids, what appear to be six stiffening ribs positioned around the engine cowl's exterior circumferential surface (also made with a larger circular front opening for engine cooling when compared to the Scout A) and an enlarged rudder. Completed shortly after the outbreak of war in August 1914, they were requisitioned by the War Office. Given Royal Flying Corps serial numbers 644 and 648, one was allocated to No. 3 Squadron and the other to No. 5 Squadron for evaluation.

As Bristol's heavy bomber, the Braemar \u2013 the progenitor of the Pullman \u2013 had originally been designed to have a central engine room with driveshafts to wing-mounted propellors, the Pullman seemed a suitable candidate as a testbed for the installation of a steam turbine engine room."]}, {"page": "Bristol Type 138", "response": ["As flown, the Type 138 was a single-engine, low-wing monoplane with a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. From the outset it was designed as a dedicated research aircraft capable of reaching high altitudes; aeronautical engineer Frank Barnwell had first proposed the design to the British Air Ministry during November 1933. The revised design was produced in response to the issuing of Specification 2/34 by the Air Ministry during June 1934. The specification, which called for a pair of prototypes, sought an aircraft that would be capable of achieving the unheard-of altitude of 50,000\u00a0feet; it had been issued in response to public pressure in favour of government sponsoring of such record attempts.", "In November 1933, having observed interest within the British Air Ministry as a result of the success of the Everest flight, aeronautical engineer Frank Barnwell proposed a purpose-built high-altitude research aircraft. This proposal, designated the Type 138, was a large single-engine, single-seat monoplane, equipped with a retractable undercarriage and a supercharged Pegasus engine.Winchester 2005, pp. 26\u201327. Nothing came of this until Italian pilot Renato Donati achieved a new world record during April 1934; after this, public opinion swung in favour of a new, government-sponsored record attempt.

In comparison to contemporary efforts by other British manufacturers, such as Airco's DH.5, the emerging design was considered to be more radical, having adopted a highly aerodynamically clean monoplane configuration. It featured a carefully streamlined circular cross-section fuselage built using conventional wood and fabric construction techniques to minimise manufacturing difficulty. On 14 July 1916, the first prototype, designated as the M.1A, conducted its maiden flight, flown by F.P. Raynham. During testing, the type quickly demonstrated its capabilities as a high speed aircraft for the era, possessing a maximum speed that was some 30\u201350\u00a0mph (50\u201380\u00a0km/h) higher than any of the contemporary German Fokker Eindecker and French Morane-Saulnier N monoplanes.", "During the First World War, rapid advances in the field of aeroplanes were being made amongst the participating nations, each side aiming to acquire an advantage over the enemy. In the summer of 1916, British aeronautical engineer Frank Barnwell, the chief designer of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, realising the performance of existing fighter aircraft to be inadequate, set about designing a new fighter aircraft as a private venture. For experimental purposes, several Bristol Scout D aircraft were outfitted  Clerget rotary engine and large-diameter propellers; considered to be a success, Barnwell decided to incorporate these features into his emerging design.Bruce 1967, p. 3."]}, {"page": "Bristol Ten-seater", "response": ["In 1919 and 1920, Frank Barnwell, chief designer of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, considered designs for a commercial transport aircraft, ranging from single-engine, three-seat aircraft to four-engine aircraft carrying ten passengers, none of which were built. Early in 1921, the British government decided to provide subsidies for approved airlines, so Bristol's management authorised Barnwell to proceed with a design for a single-engined transport aircraft. It was intended to be powered by a Bristol Jupiter engine, but this had not yet been type-approved, so the initial prototype was fitted with a Napier Lion engine instead.Barnes 1964, pp.156\u2013157."]}, {"page": "Bristol Boarhound", "response": ["The Boarhound, designed by Captain Frank Barnwell, was a two-bay biplane which used a method of steel construction which involved high-tensile steel strips, rolled into cusped and flanged sections, which were riveted together to form longerons and struts.
