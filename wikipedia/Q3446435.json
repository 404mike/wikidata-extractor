He was left out of the 2013 Lions squad, instead heading to the South African Quadrangular Tournament with Scotland. He kicked a last-minute conversion against Italy to salvage something from an underwhelming tournament, giving Scotland a 30\u201329 victory. He continued to captain Edinburgh throughout the 2013\u201314 season, missing out on a place in the Amlin Challenge Cup on points difference.
