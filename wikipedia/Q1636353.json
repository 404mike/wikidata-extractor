However, the treatment of women \u2013 as wives, rather than erotic or mythological figures \u2013 is significantly different from other sympotic poetry.  Leslie Schear argues that the poem, with its focus on wives, is related to marriage. She suggests that it was intended as a poem to be performed at a wedding feast, initiating the new groom into the ranks of married men.", "The poem was probably written for sympotic performance. It is seen by Robin Osborne as an attempt to reinforce male power structures, which \"depended on, and [were] constantly reinforced by, [the] abuse of women\". Teresa Morgan notes, though, that despite the fact that the poem echoes patriarchal power-structures, men in the poem have surprisingly little control over their wives, who are able to misbehave in all the ways attributed to them in the poem."]}, {"page": "Oxford History of Art", "response": ["| Robin Osborne"]}, {"page": "Faculty of Classics, University of Cambridge", "response": ["* Professor of Ancient History (currently Robin Osborne)"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2000s", "response": ["* Professor Robin Osborne (University of Cambridge) Ancient History"]}, {"page": "Grote Prize", "response": ["Winners have acknowledged gratitude to the prize committee in subsequent publications the prize has facilitated.
