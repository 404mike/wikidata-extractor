He is a left-handed batsman and wicket-keeper who played for Somerset before he was released in 2007. He was born in Taunton.\nSpurway started his career with Twenty20 cricket in 2005, following two years in the Second XI, before playing his debut first-class game in August 2006. In his first game, Spurway scored 46 runs before being caught out, in an innings victory for Somerset. He continued to play well for the team in a lower-order position, despite Somerset finishing 2006 dead last in Division Two of the County Championship.\nSpurway remained in the team for the start of the 2007 season, as the team were enjoying a current upturn in their fortunes. The lower-order batsman, who was the preferred wicket-keeper over team-mate Carl Gazzard, continued to pull in impressive performances in the lower-order, none more so than when he was halted in the middle of a run towards his first half-century on 44* in a record-setting Somerset innings of 850-7 declared in April 2007. However, Craig Kieswetter became Somerset's first-choice wicketkeeper after some impressive performances in the one-day side. The club now maintains a policy to have only two wicketkeepers in their squad, which meant that Kieswetter and Gazzard were retained, at the expense of Spurway.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Somerset Sabres started positively in the chase, making their way to 32 for 2 after four overs, but a wicket maiden over from David Masters - including the wicket of Somerset captain Ian Blackwell - set them back.
