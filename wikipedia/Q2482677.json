It was only when a number of suffragists, despairing of change through peaceful means, decided to turn to militant protest that the \"suffragette\" was born. These women broke the law in pursuit of their aims, and many were imprisoned at Holloway for their criminal activity. They were not treated as political prisoners, the authorities arguing they were imprisoned for their vandalism, not their opinions. In protest, some went on hunger strike and were force fed so Holloway has a large symbolic role in the history of women's rights in the UK for those in sympathy with the movement.
