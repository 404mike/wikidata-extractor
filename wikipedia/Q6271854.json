Judges were initially appointed subject to His Majesty's pleasure. Later, they were appointed for life. Now, judges are subject to a mandatory retirement age.  A judge's appointment in the colonies was always subject to the Sovereign's pleasure.  The judge could be recalled at any time.  Jeffery Hart Bent, the first judge appointed in Australia, was removed from office and replaced with Barron Field in 1817 following Bent's unsatisfactory performance.*  Until the passing of the Australia Acts, a judge could also be suspended or \u201camoved\u201d (a technical legal term for removal of a colonial judge from office) at any time by the governor of the colony or State. Prior to 1901, two judges, judges John Walpole Willis and Algernon Sidney Montagu, had been removed from office pursuant to the Colonial Leave of Absence Act 1782 (UK) (commonly known as Burke's Act). This was unlike their English counterparts.  The Act of Settlement 1701 (UK) provided that judges could only be removed by the Crown on an address by both houses of the British Parliament. This was to overcome the Stuart period in England where judges favourable to the crown were appointed and unfavourable judges were removed. In 1830, Sir Jonah Barrington was the first Common Law judge removed from office under that law, and probably the only English to be so.

His trial took place on 23 April 1795, in Dublin Stella Tillyard, Citizen Lord Edward Fitzgerald, p.187 and he was found guilty. One week later, on the morning of his sentencing hearing Jackson stepped into the dock looking terribly ill. He reportedly vomited out of the carriage window on his ride from prison to the courtroom, and when he removed his hat, one observer noted that steam rose from his head.  As his lawyers made drawn out speeches, hoping to avoid judgment on the technicality of an improperly filed indictment, Jackson's condition steadily worsened. He gripped his sides, shuddering and grimacing in pain.  The judges ordered that a chair be provided for him and asked that a doctor attend him.  He then collapsed and died.  An autopsy found that Jackson had ingested a large quantity of a \"metallic poison.\"  This was likely administered by his (then pregnant) second wife, but the inquest pointedly refused to assign blame.
