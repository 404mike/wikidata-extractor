Over a period of approximately 60 years he wrote, adapted, or collaborated on 176 plays in a wide range of genres including extravaganza, farce, comedy, burletta, melodrama and opera. Planch\u00e9 was responsible for introducing historically accurate costume into nineteenth century British theatre, and subsequently became an acknowledged expert on historical costume, publishing a number of works on the topic.\nPlanch\u00e9's interest in historical costume led to other antiquarian research, including heraldry and genealogy. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1829, and was influential in the foundation of the British Archaeological Association in 1843. Appointed Rouge Croix Pursuivant in 1854 and promoted to Somerset Herald in 1866, Planch\u00e9 undertook heraldic and ceremonial duties as a member of the College of Arms.

Planch\u00e9 introduced the \"vampire trap\" as a way for the title fiend to appear in a dream at the beginning and then to vanish into the earth at his destruction. Nodier's play was also the basis of an opera called Der Vampyr by the German composer Heinrich Marschner, who set the story in a more plausible Wallachia. Planch\u00e9 in turn translated the libretto of this opera into English in 1827, where it was performed at the Lyceum also. Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re later redramatized the story in a play also entitled Le Vampire (1851). Another theatrical vampire of this period was \"Sir Alan Raby\", who is the lead character of The Vampire (1852), a play by Dion Boucicault.

After 1843, when theatres other than the original patent theatres were permitted to perform spoken dialogue, the importance of the silent harlequinade began to decrease, while the importance of the fairy-tale part of the pantomime increased.\"The Origin of Popular Pantomime Stories\", Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed January 8, 2016. Two writers who helped to elevate the importance and popularity of the fairy-tale portion of the pantomime were James Planch\u00e9 and Henry James Byron. They emphasized puns and humorous word play, a tradition that continues in pantomime today. As manager of Drury Lane in the 1870s, Augustus Harris wrote a series of extraordinarily popular pantomimes, focusing on the spectacle of the productions, that pushed this transition by emphasizing comic business in the pantomime opening and grand processionals.Mayer, p. 324 By the end of the 19th century, the harlequinade had become merely a brief epilogue to the pantomime, dwindling into a brief display of dancing and acrobatics.Crowther, Andrew. \"Clown and Harlequin\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, vol. 3, issue 23, Summer 2008, pp. 710\u201312. It lingered for a few decades longer but finally disappeared, although a few of its comic elements had been incorporated into the pantomime stories. The last harlequinade was played at the Lyceum Theatre in 1939.The Development of Pantomime, Its-Behind-You.com, accessed 3 January 2014"]}, {"page": "John Baldwin Buckstone", "response": ["Buckstone became lessee of the Haymarket from 1853 to 1877. For this theatre, he continued to write plays and farces, though markedly fewer than before. As actor-manager of the Haymarket, he surrounded himself with an admirable and effective ensemble company, including Edward Askew Sothern, Henry Compton, Mr. and Mrs. Charles James Mathews and the Kendals. He produced the plays of James Planch\u00e9, Thomas William Robertson, Tom Taylor, John Oxenford, H. J. Byron and W. S. Gilbert, as well as his own, and in most of these he acted. Buckstone's management made the Haymarket into the premier comedy theatre of the age. His own gifts as a comic actor contributed much to the theatre's remarkable success. According to The Times, \"Few men... have possessed to a greater extent the power of communicating the spirit of mirth to an audience. ... He was helped, too, in his vocation by remarkable physical attributes\" and a peculiar, hilarious voice."]}, {"page": "Victorian literature", "response": ["In drama, farces, musical burlesques, extravaganzas and comic operas competed with Shakespeare productions and serious drama by the likes of James Planch\u00e9 and Thomas William Robertson. In 1855, the German Reed Entertainments began a process of elevating the level of (formerly risqu\u00e9) musical theatre in Britain that culminated in the famous series of comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan and were followed by the 1890s with the first Edwardian musical comedies. The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London comedy Our Boys by H. J. Byron, opening in 1875. Its astonishing new record of 1,362 performances was bested in 1892 by Charley's Aunt by Brandon Thomas. After W. S. Gilbert, Oscar Wilde became the leading poet and dramatist of the late Victorian period.Stedman, Jane W. (1996). W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian & His Theatre, pp. 26\u201329. Oxford University Press.  Wilde's plays, in particular, stand apart from the many now forgotten plays of Victorian times and have a closer relationship to those of the Edwardian dramatists such as George Bernard Shaw, whose career began in the 1890s. Wilde's 1895 comic masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest, was the greatest of the plays in which he held an ironic mirror to the aristocracy while displaying virtuosic mastery of wit and paradoxical wisdom.

From 1816 to 1830, it served as The English Opera House. After a fire, the house was rebuilt and reopened on 14 July 1834 to a design by Samuel Beazley.
