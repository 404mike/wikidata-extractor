She worked for Nottinghamshire County Council operating around Radford, Nottingham and Hyson Green in child protection and adoption services. In 1986 she received a letter from a woman in Australia who, believing she was an orphan, was looking to locate her birth certificate so she could get married.In 1987, she investigated and brought to public attention the British government programme of Home Children. This involved forcibly relocating poor British children to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the former Rhodesia and other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, often without their parents' knowledge. Children were often told their parents had died, and parents were told their children had been placed for adoption elsewhere in the UK. According to Humphreys, up to 150,000 children are believed to have been resettled under the scheme, some as young as three, about 7,000 of whom were sent to Australia.Saving money was one of the motives behind this policy. The children were allegedly deported because it was cheaper to care for them overseas. It cost an estimated \u00a35 per day to keep a child on welfare in a British institution, but only 10% of that, ten shillings, in an Australian one.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of historical films set in Near Eastern and Western civilization", "response": ["| Oranges and Sunshine || 2010 || 1980s || Based on the book Empty Cradles by Margaret Humphreys about her investigations in British Home Children."]}, {"page": "David Hinchliffe", "response": ["In 1998 he led the enquiry by the Health Select Committee into \"The Welfare of Former British Child Migrants\" following the exposure of the scandal by Margaret Humphreys in her book \"Empty Cradles\".
