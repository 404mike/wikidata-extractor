Instead, he gradually replaced the older players with players as young as 16 and 17. These included right-back Bill Foulkes, centre-halves Mark Jones and Jackie Blanchflower, wingers Albert Scanlon and David Pegg and forward Billy Whelan. Among them was Duncan Edwards, judged by many to be England's finest player of his era, and capped by England at 17 \u2013 setting a record for the youngest-ever full international that remained unbroken for more than 40 years.
