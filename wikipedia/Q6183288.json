Together, they settled on a porch, complete with hanging baskets. Archie built the porch for Hilda and finished it in less than a week, but there was a last minute snag: planning permission, as Jerry Booth reminded them as they proudly admired their handiwork. Archie went to the Town Hall to sort it out but was unsuccessful and Hilda was told by Councillor Warburton to take the porch down. Shortly after this, the porch disappeared and believing that the council would not just take it, Hilda decided it must have been stolen. However, Archie never got the chance to make good on his threat to turn the thief into mincemeat as shortly thereafter, Hilda received a telegram from the hospital revealing that Stan was on his way home and hence Archie would have to go. Archie suggested that Hilda take another job so that she could look after him and Stan, but one Stan was enough for Hilda."]}]}}
