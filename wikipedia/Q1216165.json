Bowerbank had assigned fossil remains to two new species; the first was named in 1846 as Pterodactylus giganteus; the specific name means 'the gigantic one' in Latin, in reference to the large size of the remains, and the second species was named in 1851 as Pterodactylus cuvieri, in honor of the French scientist Georges Cuvier. Later in 1851, Owen named and described new pterosaur specimens that have been found yet again in England. He assigned these specimens to a new species called Pterodactylus compressirostris.Owen, R. (1851). Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Cretaceous Formations. The Palaeontographical Society 5(11):1\u2013118. In 1914 however, paleontologist Reginald Hooley redescribed P. compressirostris, to which he erected the genus Lonchodectes (), and therefore made P. compressirostris the type species, and created the new combination L. compressirostris. In a 2013 review, P. giganteus and P. cuvieri were reassigned to new genera; P. giganteus was reassigned to a genus called  Lonchodraco ('lance dragon'), which resulted in a new combination called L. giganteus, and P. cuvieri was reassigned to the new genus Cimoliopterus ('chalk wing'), creating C. cuvieri. Back in 1859, Owen had found remains the front part of a snout in the Cambridge Greensand, and assigned it into the species Pterodactylus segwickii; in honor of Adam Sedgwick, a British geologist.Owen, R. (1859). Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Cretaceous formations. Supplement no. I. Palaeontographical Society, London, p. 19 This species however, was reassigned to the genus Camposipterus in 2013, therefore creating the new combination Camposipterus segwickii. Later, in 1861, Owen had uncovered multiple distinctively looking fossil remains yet again in the Cambridge Greensand, these were assigned to a new species named Pterodactylus simus,Martill, David. (2010). The early history of pterosaur discovery in Great Britain. Geological Society of London Special Publications. 343. 287\u2013311.  though the British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley had created a separate generic name called Ornithocheirus, and reassigned P. simus as the type species, which created the combination Ornithocheirus simus. Between the years 1869 and 1870, Seeley had reassigned many pterosaur species into Ornithocheirus, while also creating several new species. Many of these species however, are now reclassified to other genera, or considered . In 1874, further specimens were found in England, again by Owen, these ones were assigned to a new species called Pterodactylus sagittirostris,Owen, R. 1874. \"A Monograph on the Fossil Reptilia of the Mesozoic Formations. 1. Pterosauria.\" The Palaeontographical Society Monograph 27: 1\u201314 this species however, was reassigned to the genus Lonchodectes in 1914 by Hooley, which resulted in an L. sagittirostris. This conclusion was revised by Rigal et al. in 2017, who disagreed with Hooley's reassignment, and therefore created the genus Serradraco, which afterwards resulted in a new combination called S. sagittirostris."]}, {"page": "1797", "response": ["* July 14 \u2013 James Scott Bowerbank, British naturalist, palaeontologist (d. 1877)"]}, {"page": "Sponge", "response": ["* James Scott Bowerbank"]}, {"page": "Lucas Barrett", "response": ["James Scott Bowerbank named in 1858 a new species of deep-sea sponge after him: Geodia barretti.

The larger half of the block (including seventeen vertebrae, parts of ribs and a coracoid, some of the pelvis, and assorted hindleg remains) was given to naturalist James Scott Bowerbank, and the remainder (including eleven caudal vertebrae and most of the rest of hindlegs) to Gideon Mantell. After his death, Mantell's portion was acquired by the British Museum; Bowerbank's was acquired later, bringing both halves back together. Richard Owen studied both halves and, in 1855, published a short article on the specimen, considering it to be a young Iguanodon rather than a new taxon. This was unquestioned until 1867, when Thomas Henry Huxley compared the vertebrae and metatarsals of the specimen more closely to those of known Iguanodon, and concluded that it must be a different animal entirely. The next year, he saw a fossil skull discovered by William Fox on exhibition at the Norwich Meeting of the British Associations. Fox, who had also found his fossil in the Cowleaze Chine area, along with several other specimens, considered it to belong to a juvenile Iguanodon, or to represent a new, small species in the genus. Huxley noticed its unique dentition and edentulous premaxilla, reminiscent of but obviously distinct from that of Iguanodon. He concluded this specimen, too, represented a distinct animal from Iguanodon. After losing track of the specimen for some months, Huxley requested Fox grant him permission to study the specimen to a more extensive degree. The request was granted, and Huxley began work on his new species."]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Bowerbank \u2013 James Scott Bowerbank (1797\u20131877)"]}, {"page": "Bowerbank", "response": ["* James Scott Bowerbank (1797-1877), British naturalist and palaeontologist "]}, {"page": "Leucosolenia", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by James Scott Bowerbank"]}, {"page": "Ray Society", "response": ["During Charles Darwin's lifetime, the Ray Society published not only Darwin's two volumes on living barnacles (1851 and 1854) but also the work of many of the foremost British naturalists: Thomas Henry Huxley, William Crawford Williamson, John Blackwall, Albert G\u00fcnther, James Scott Bowerbank, etc.List of the Annual Volumes of the Ray Society, from their Commencement, in 1844, to August, 1880"]}, {"page": "1797 in Great Britain", "response": ["* 14 July \u2013 James Scott Bowerbank, naturalist, palaeontologist (died 1877)"]}, {"page": "Ecionemia", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by James Scott Bowerbank"]}, {"page": "Polymastia (sponge)", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by James Scott Bowerbank"]}, {"page": "1877 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 8 March \u2013 James Scott Bowerbank, naturalist and palaeontologist (born 1797)"]}, {"page": "Cimoliornis", "response": ["In 1842, James Scott Bowerbank re-examined the remains and concluded that they actually belonged to a pterosaur, based on the microstructure of the bones, and estimated that it would have had a wingspan of about .

Harry Govier Seeley recognized this error in 1866 and established the genus Megalornis, though he misspelled the specific name as emuianus. However, the genus name he chose had already been used for some of the great herons (Ardea). Richard Owen established the genera Dasornis (in 1870) and Argillornis (in 1878)Owen (1878) for, respectively, a broken skull and two humerus ends that were found in the same deposits. Some authors claim he erected the former genus in 1869 already, but in that year he only used the names informally in his brief initial report on the newly discovered skull. Misled by the skull's large size and perhaps overly eager to be the first to describe the remains of a \"European moa\" (Owen was the foremost authority on these New Zealand endemics at that time), he placed Dasornis in the Dinornithidae. Argillornis, on the other hand, was recognized early on as some sort of aquatic bird, but its immense size puzzled paleontologists to no little extent.Woodward (1909): p.87), Brodkorb (1963: p.248-249, 1967: p.142-143), Ml\u00edkovsk\u00fd (2002: pp.82-83), Mayr (2008, 2009: p.56)"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Hawes", "response": ["The zoologists Grant and Vigors were concerned that the Museum should become a research institution, with systematic across the field of natural history, and should implement current views on taxonomy; they had support from James Scott Bowerbank, but they were resisted successfully by Philip Grey Egerton and John George Children, who backed the more conservative views of Richard Owen.Desmond, pp. 146\u201350; Internet Archive.

British paleontologist James Scott Bowerbank named and described the specimens found as a new species of Pterodactylus, P. giganteus due to its much larger size. P. giganteus is nowadays considered to belong to the genus called Lonchodraco. In 1851, Bowerbank unearthed more specimens in the same chalk pit as P. giganteus, and assigned these specimens to yet another newly named species of Pterodactylus, known as P. cuvieri, in honor of the German naturalist and zoologist Georges Cuvier. Later that year, British paleontologist Sir Richard Owen had also unearthed several fossil specimens in the Chalk Formation, in which he assigned them as Pterodactylus compressirostris during its description.Owen, R. (1851). Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Cretaceous Formations. The Palaeontographical Society 5(11):1-118. Owen later unearthed many fossil specimens from a different fossil site called the Cambridge Greensand, he then assigned these specimens into a new species called Pterodactylus simus. With the naming of this new species, British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley created a new separate genus called Ornithocheirus (from Ancient Greek \"\u1f44\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2\", meaning \"bird\", and \"\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c1\", meaning \"hand\"), due to the notion of the time, in which pterosaurs were the direct ancestors of birds. In 1870, Seeley then also reassigned Pterodactylus cuvieri into a new species called Ornithocheirus cuvieri.Seeley, H.G., 1869, Index to the fossil remains of Aves, Ornithosauria, and Reptilia, from the Secondary System of Strata, arranged in the Woodwardian Museum of the University of Cambridge.

Cambridge, 130 pp. This species is now considered to belong to the genus Cimoliopterus. Back in 1874 however, controversies between the naming of species and genera of these pterosaurs started, with the paleontologists Harry Seeley and Richard Owen fighting over reassignings of different species as well as genera. Owen therefore created two new genera: Coloborhynchus (meaning \"maimed beak\") and Criorhynchus (meaning \"ram beak\"), in reference to their unique convex \"keeled\" crests on top, and underside of their snout. Owen then created a type species for Coloborhynchus, C. clavirostris, and sunk three species which were assigned previously to Ornithocheirus, and Criorhynchus consisted entirely of former Ornithocheirus species.Owen, R. 1874, Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Mesozoic Formations. Palaeontographical Society, London, 14 pp Later in 1881 however, Seeley disagreed with Owen's conclusions, and he therefore assigned the species he named Ornithocheirus simus as the type species of Ornithocheirus."]}, {"page": "Cimoliopterus", "response": ["The taxonomic history of Cimoliopterus and related pterosaurs from the Cretaceous of England has been described as confusing by modern pterosaur researchers, since many of them were described from very fragmentary remains, and named using convoluted nomenclatural schemes of the Victorian era. Prior to these discoveries, many of the hollow, thin-walled pterosaur bones found in England were thought to have belonged to birds. In 1851, the British naturalist James Scott Bowerbank described a large pterosaur snout he had obtained, which was found in the Lower Culand Pit in what is now called the Grey Chalk Subgroup at Burham, Kent, in South East England. Pterosaur fossils had been discovered earlier in the same pit, including the front part of some jaws Bowerbank had used as the basis for the species Pterodactylus giganteus in 1846, as well as other bones. Based on the new snout, Bowebank named the species Pterodactylus cuvieri; at this time, the genus Pterodactylus (originally named in 1815 based on a Bavarian specimen) was used for many pterosaur species now thought to be distantly related to each other.
