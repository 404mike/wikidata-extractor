The club found themselves bottom of the table again at the end of the Christmas period, and consequently, Fletcher was sacked on 1 January 2013 and replaced on 6 January by John Sheridan. In the second half of the season, the club was again narrowly saved from relegation, and they finished 21st for the second season in a row. Sheridan then agreed a three-year contract to continue as Argyle manager, and in his first full season in charge, the club finished 10th, an achievement which displayed great improvement on the previous two seasons. Argyle had a far stronger start to their fourth consecutive season in League 2, winning 4 games consecutively for the first time since 2008. Despite a poor run of results over Christmas and the New Year, including a 0\u20130 draw against a 10-man York City, Argyle looked set to clinch a League 2 play-off position thanks to a 3\u20132 home win against Tranmere Rovers, a result which, at the same time, relegated the away side out of the Football League for the first time in 94 years. Derek Adams was appointed in 2015 and by Christmas, Argyle were top of the league. But by February they had slipped down to 2nd and with a 2\u20132 Draw with Cambridge United F.C. made it impossible for Argyle to get automatic promotion. After a 2\u20132 draw with Portsmouth F.C. Argyle secured a place in the EFL League Two play-off final via a 91st-minute header from Peter Hartley. But after a poor performance in the final, Argyle were, surprising beaten 2\u20130 by AFC Wimbledon from 78th and 98th-minute goals. The 2016\u201317 season saw Argyle, for the second season in a row, at the top of the table at the midpoint of the season at Christmas. But argyle slipped down to second place after a poor run of form after Christmas. With 4 games to go, Argyle only needed 1 point to seal promotion. But a comprehensive 6\u20131 victory against Newport County on 17 April in front of a packed Home Park to make it impossible for Luton Town to catch them. They therefore were promoted to League One after six years in the fourth tier. On the last day of the season, Argyle had the chance to go up as champions. But after a 1\u20131 draw with Grimsby Town F.C. the title was handed to Portsmouth F.C. via goal difference. The pilgrims got off to an appalling start to their League one campaign with only racking up 5 points in their first 11 games and receiving 4 red cards in 4 consecutive home games, sitting rock bottom, 4 points off of safety even 11 games in. And a 2\u20131 defeat at home to Fleetwood added to Argyle's woes pushing their winless run to 10 games racking up 2 points from a possible 30 in that time. Some fans disputed about the board sacking Derek Adams even after taking them up in the previous season due to poor tactics and game management. The turn of December 2017, into 2018 saw argyle record 16 wins, 6 draws and only 5 losses to escape relegation and finish 7th, only missing out on a play-off spot by 3 points."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["The 2011\u201312 League One fixtures were released on 17 June 2011, with Stevenage opening their league campaign at home to Exeter City on 6 August 2011. The game ended 0\u20130, with both sides spurning a number of goalscoring opportunities. The result meant that Stevenage had drawn their opening league fixture for the third consecutive season. A week later, Stevenage drew 1\u20131 away at Chesterfield. Stevenage took the lead five minutes before the interval, Darius Charles heading in from close range after Michael Bostwick's looping header was guided towards goal. Bostwick was sent-off twenty minutes into the second-half, receiving a second bookable offence for a foul on Mark Allott. The home side equalised late on when Jack Lester headed in Dean Morgan's cross. Three days later, Stevenage earned their first win of the season, securing a 3\u20131 away victory against Bournemouth. Stevenage took the lead shortly before half-time, Craig Reid's quick turn and shot beating Shwan Jalal in the Bournemouth goal after Lawrie Wilson's threaded ball beat the offside trap. Two minutes after the interval, the home side were level, substitute Harry Arter scoring from Marc Pugh's squared pass. The away side took the lead once more with half an hour remaining, John Mousinho scoring from the penalty spot after Bournemouth captain Adam Barrett handled Stacy Long's shot on the line, receiving a red card in the process for denying a goalscoring opportunity. Stevenage doubled their advantage in injury-time when Chris Beardsley latched on to Scott Laird's pass and beat Jalal with a first time finish. Stevenage then drew 2\u20132 at home to Hartlepool United on 20 August, coming from two goals down to salvage a point. The visitors opened the scoring through Peter Hartley's headed goal from a corner ten minutes before the interval. Hartlepool doubled their lead just before half-time through an Adam Boyd penalty kick after Colin Nish was fouled in the area by Jon Ashton. With twenty minutes remaining, Byron Harrison scored his first goal of the season when he netted from six yards out. Scott Laird then restored parity with just two minutes remaining, heading in Robin Shroot's corner to ensure Stevenage earned a point.

The key aim was to gain automatic promotion and that was a task that had so far in the first half of the season been greatly helped by on loan winger Ben Marshall, who had probably been the best player for The Owls so far. However, the thing on all the fans' minds was Marshall's future at the club, as his loan from Stoke City was due to end during the middle of the month and his contract at Stoke City due to end in the summer. Only being 20 years of age, it was made clear by Gary Megson, known to be great friends with Stoke City manager Tony Pulis, the outcome would either be that 'Marshall will either sign a new contract at Stoke City and hopefully come back on loan to us (Sheffield Wednesday) or another club will snap him up and buy him'. Wednesday had a match to concentrate on however and their first game of 2012 came at home to Tranmere Rovers. The home game was first of four in a row for Wednesday. Sheffield Wednesday got off to a great start when Reda Johnson scored on just the second minute, then five minutes later Chris Lines scored his first home goal of the club to put The Owls 2\u20130 up. The game relaxed after this until the eighty-second minute when Ian Goodison scored from a corner to put a nervous last ten minutes of the game, with Sheffield Wednesday losing points in the final minutes of games just weeks earlier. However, Sheffield Wednesday managed to hold on and the game finished 2\u20131. On the Thursday after this game left back Mark Reynolds who had played only a few games since he joined the club at the beginning of the season was sent out on loan till the end of the season to Aberdeen. Sheffield Wednesday faced top of the Football League Championship West Ham United in the FA Cup the following weekend. Both teams made changes and was a very tight encounter even though the odds were stacked up on West Ham United to go through to the next round. It took a late goal to separate the sides when Chris O'Grady scored with two minutes to go of the ninety and sent Sheffield Wednesday through to the next round of the competition. The next day Sheffield Wednesday found they would be playing Blackpool away in Round 4 of the competition. With the transfer market open for the January month The Owls made their first signing when Miguel Llera, who had signed on loan for the month previously, signed on a two-year contract on a free transfer from Blackpool. Also, the club saw the introduction of Mike Jones a winger signed on an undisclosed fee for two-and-a-half years from fellow League One club Bury. In terms of departures, the club saw three when young goalkeeper Sean Cuff was sent out on loan to Cambridge United for a month, out-of-contract James O'Connor left for American club Orlando City, and Giles Coke went back on loan to Bury for the rest of the season. Back to matches and Sheffield Wednesday faced their toughest opponent of the season so far when the played top of the league Charlton Athletic at home, Charlton Athletic were five points clear of second place Sheffield Wednesday and had not dropped from the top of the league since October. The first goal was largely expected to be the key goal and the team who would go on to win the game. Sheffield Wednesday, unbeaten at home throughout the season and only having two draws at Hillsborough Stadium, started slightly on the back foot in front of a crowd of over 26,000 and were the first to concede when Charlton Athletic captain Johnnie Jackson curled a free-kick around the wall and into the net. That turned out to be the only goal of the game and Sheffield Wednesday were ended of their unbeaten run since the beginning of the season at home. Although with much of the season to go, the game was likely to end any chances of Sheffield Wednesday winning the league with Charlton Athletic now eight points clear of second place and Wednesday slipping down to fourth place with city rivals Sheffield United taking up second place four points ahead of The Owls, although they had played one extra game. The final of the four straight home games was against Hartlepool United and after a goalless first half it was Peter Hartley's goal that put Hartlepool United ahead two minutes into the second half. It took a goal by Jermaine Johnson when he took on four players on the right flank before finishing into the far, low bottom corner to put Sheffield Wednesday back on level terms. That goal lifted the fans in the stadium and the players reacted and scored a second with fifteen minutes to go with Gary Madine on the score sheet this time. However, again The Owls opted to start to defend their lead and then what seemed to be a goal out of nothing from outside the box and caught the keeper off his line, as Antony Sweeney's eighty-eighth minute effort meant Sheffield Wednesday could only manage a draw. With Wednesday reaching Round 3 of the FA Cup it meant that the game they would have played in the league on that same weekend was rescheduled to mid-week. This game was rescheduled to 24 January and was away to Scunthorpe United. After two disappointing results in a row Sheffield Wednesday were looking to bounce back. Sheffield Wednesday did exactly that when Chris O'Grady scored in under a minute after a long ball from Miguel Llera found the striker. Sheffield Wednesday then doubled their lead seventeen minutes later as Chris O'Grady grabbed his second. In the second half there was another goal from Jermaine Johnson, when he took on three players after running from the half-way line and slotted the ball coolly into the net when he found himself one-on-one. Jordan Robertson did pull one back for Scunthorpe United from a corner, but the game did finish 1\u20133 to The Owls. Sheffield Wednesday's next trip was in the FA Cup against Blackpool. Gary Megson made many changes to the side as he wanted to rest his key players ready for the tough mid-week tie in the league against fifth place MK Dons. One of those changes was striker Clinton Morrison who put The Owls unexpectedly ahead on the fifty-second minute. However, Sheffield Wednesday conceded yet another late, late goal, this time it was in the last minute of stoppage time again when Sheffield Wednesday conceded a penalty and Kevin Phillips scored from the spot in the ninety-minute, meaning a replay had to be played \u2013 something that neither team wanted due to their league focuses. The draw for the FA Cup saw the winner of the replay to play Premier League side Everton in the fifth round of the competition. After this Tottenham Hotspur young midfielder John Bostock join The Owls on loan until the end of the season. Mid-week and the last day of the month saw Sheffield Wednesday away to fifth place Milton Keynes Dons. Sheffield Wednesday were six points ahead of Milton Keynes Dons in fourth place; however they had played one more game than Milton Keynes Dons. An effort from distance saw the ball hit the bar and then hit goalkeeper Stephen Bywater's leg and roll into the net, giving Milton Keynes Dons the lead after seventeen minutes. Ten minutes later however a corner for Sheffield Wednesday saw Gary MacKenzie put the ball into his own net after the ball bounced off his knee, making it two own goals in the game. The game finished 1\u20131 and as a result Sheffield Wednesday went home happy with. However, the bad news of the month was Sheffield Wednesday were unable to extend key player Ben Marshall's loan until the end of the season. Marshall had made twenty-two appearances for the club, scoring five goals, and was signed by Football League Championship club Leicester City for over a million pounds. The loss of Marshall could have affected the team coming up to the 'business' and most crucial part of the season, and with Sheffield Wednesday only winning one of their last four gains with Ben Marshall, how much of an effect would his loss have on Sheffield Wednesday's automatic promotion hopes?"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Hartlepool United F.C. season", "response": ["|Peter Hartley ", "|Peter Hartley", "| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Hartlepool Mail Player of the Year || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Peter Hartley", "| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Players' Player of the Year || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Peter Hartley"]}, {"page": "Hartley (surname)", "response": ["* Peter Hartley (cricketer) (born 1960), English cricketer", "* Peter Hartley (footballer) (born 1988), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Football League One", "response": ["|Peter Hartley"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Yeovil Town F.C. season", "response": ["Yeovil began the month with a home fixture against fellow play-off chasers Brentford, Yeovil won the game 3\u20130 courtesy of a fourteenth goal of the season for Paddy Madden, superb 25-yard second from Ed Upson on his 100th appearance for the club and a volley from centre back Dan Burn.
