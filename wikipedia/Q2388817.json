At first, the anarchists, who controlled the borders with France, were told to refuse communist volunteers, but reluctantly allowed their passage after protests.

They were met by international volunteers who had already been fighting in Spain: Germans from the Th\u00e4lmann Battalion, Italians from the Centuria Gastone Sozzi and French from the Commune de Paris Battalion. Among them was British poet John Cornford. Men were sorted according to their experience and origin and dispatched to units.", "An attack was then launched by the Republic on the C\u00f3rdoba front. The battle ended in a form of stalemate; a communique was issued, saying: \"During the day the advance continued without the loss of any territory.\" Poets Ralph Winston Fox and John Cornford were killed. Eventually, the Nationalists advanced, taking the hydroelectric station at El Campo. Andr\u00e9 Marty accused the commander of the Marseillaise Battalion, Gaston Delasalle, of espionage and treason and had him executed.

Many of these figures were not Gaels, and some critics have noted MacLean's unusual generosity to non-Gaelic people in his work.

Donald reviewed Contemporary Literature and Social Revolution by J. D. Charques, praising the book in slightly patronising terms for its readiness \"to hint at a Marxist conception of literature\". In 1934, he became the editor of the Silver Crescent, the Trinity Hall students' magazine. His editorials stressed the decline in world trade, rearmament and arms trafficking.
