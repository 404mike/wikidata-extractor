Although they were unable to determine any new evidence they agreed that there were serious issues to be addressed regarding the final summing up by the trial judge, Mr Justice Shearman. Although acting as prosecution and defence Wass and Dein presented a joint submission to Senior Crown Court Judge David Radford for consideration, arguing that there was no case to answer by Edith Thompson with regard to the charge that was brought against her. Judge Radford gave his opinion that the summing up in the case was deficient and had failed to offer correct direction to the jury. He considered that it had been unfair and unbalanced and that there were grounds for coming to a decision that the conviction of Edith Thompson was both unsafe and unsatisfactory. This was followed by a second BBC 2 programme in 2019, with the same participants, to take account of the reburial of Edith Thompson in November 2018.", "The case of Edith Thompson was featured in Murder, Mystery, and My Family, with barristers Jeremy Dein QC and Sasha Wass QC investigating whether Edith Thompson had suffered a miscarriage of justice.
