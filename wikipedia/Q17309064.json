He appears to have disowned them later in life as they fail to appear in any bibliographic references.  His first book was Poems and Love Lyrics which although undated was probably published in 1857.  It was reviewed in the Athenaeum in December 1857. Although the review date is not conclusive the date is almost certainly 1857 or 1858 for the following reasons. (1) The author's second book Mary and other Poems is by the 'Author of Lyrics'.  This book is dated 1859 and signed Robt W Buchanan in the preface; (2) The preface to 'Mary' states that this is the author's second published book; (3) The preface indicates that the writer is still a young man; (4) The dedication to Hugh Macdonald suggests he was alive when it was written.  Macdonald, a well-known Glaswegian, died in 1860.  Buchanan's second book Mary and other Poems was published in 1859 and has never been mentioned in any bibliographies.  The book is extremely rare and the only copies appear to be in the Mitchell library in Glasgow. Buchanan also published a collection of short stories and poems, written in collaboration with Charles Gibbon, entitled Storm-beaten, or Christmas Eve at the \"Old Anchor\" Inn in 1862, before Undertones, which is often cited as Buchanan's first book."]}, {"page": "Blanche McManus", "response": ["| Charles Gibbon"]}, {"page": "Luigi Ferrarese", "response": ["In March 1844, Ferrarese was visited by noted Scottish phrenologist George Combe, who had earlier read and been impressed by Ferrarese's Memorie Risguardanti La Dottrina Frenologica.The Life of George Combe: Author of \"The Constitution of Man\", Charles Gibbon, 1878, page 111 At the time of his initial reading of the work, Combe had written:"]}, {"page": "The Mortal Immortal", "response": ["The story was originally published in The Keepsake for 1834 (Dec. 1833), a literary annual.
