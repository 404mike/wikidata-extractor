Criticism was also levelled at Corbyn. The Chakrabarti Inquiry exonerated the party of widespread antisemitism but found instances of \"toxic atmosphere\". The Campaign Against Antisemitism criticised the findings of the report because Shami Chakrabarti knew she was set to receive a peerage and was appointed Shadow Attorney General after delivering the report. A series of high-profile cases involved Ken Livingstone, Peter Willsman and Chris Williamson, all of whom left the party or were suspended over the issue. In 2018, the Party was divided over adopting the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, prompting 68 rabbis from the Jewish community to criticise the leadership for \"claiming to know what\u2019s good for our community\". The issue was cited by a number of MPs who left the party to set up Change UK. Later, Louise Ellman also left over the issue.

Earlier in 2019, the independent equalities watchdog, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission launched an investigation into whether the Labour Party had \"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\", following complaints by the Jewish Labour Movement and the Campaign Against Antisemitism. In 2020, the EHRC found the Labour Party \"responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political in interference in anti-Semitism complaints\", \"failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints\" and \"harassment, including the use of anti-Semitic tropes and suggesting that complaints of anti-Semitism were fake or smears\"."]}, {"page": "The Woolf Institute", "response": ["** Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth"]}, {"page": "Women rabbis and Torah scholars", "response": ["Alongside this debate, a third approach within Orthodoxy has developed. Some Orthodox institutions have accepted women in alternate roles relating to Jewish law such as halakhic advisors (Yoatzot), court advocates (Toanot) and congregational advisors. Examples of this trend gaining acceptance include the efforts of Rabbi Aryeh Strikovski of Machanaim Yeshiva and Pardes Institute who collaborated with Rabbi Avraham Shapira, former Chief Rabbi of Israel, to initiate a program for training Orthodox women as halakhic Toanot (\"advocates\") in rabbinic courts. Since then, seventy Israeli women were trained as Toanot. In England, in 2012, Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, the country's chief rabbi, appointed Lauren Levin as Britain's first Orthodox female halakhic adviser, at Finchley United Synagogue in London.
