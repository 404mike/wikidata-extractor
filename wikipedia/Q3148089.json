The 2006/07 season started much more brightly, with Roberts winning the League Two Player of the Month award for August, for which he thanked former Swindon manager Iffy Onuora for keeping faith in him. Following Paul Sturrock's decision to convert Roberts into a striker, he had his most successful Swindon season, scoring 13 goals in all competitions, and signing a new two-year contract.

Despite a knee injury picked up at Colchester United in mid-March, he attempted to play through the pain barrier \u2013 until hobbling off just before half-time in a match against Swansea City on 11 April. By now, it was obvious that Peacock needed surgery, but he decided to take a role described by Onuora as \"super sub\" \u2013 making two further cameo appearances in the following two matches. When the Town's relegation to League Two was confirmed, Peacock was rested before going under the knife during the close season. Peacock went under the knife at the end of Swindon relegation season but returned successfully and was the Town's top goalscorer by October, before being switched to a midfield role. On 24 April 2007, Peacock was named the PFA's Fans' Player of the Year in League Two.
