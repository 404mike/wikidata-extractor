According to Morrell they \"almost unanimously refrained from any mention of police brutality\", and focussed instead on the behaviour of the suffragettes. The front page of The Daily Mirror that day showed a large photograph of a suffragette on the ground, having been hit by a policeman during Black Friday; the image is probably that of Ada Wright. The art editor of the newspaper forwarded the photograph to the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police for comments.
