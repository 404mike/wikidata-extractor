A client of Edward, the Black Prince, he became a \"notorious figure\" because it was alleged that he was illiterate, although this is now largely discounted as unlikely, as he was a relatively efficient administrator.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shrewsbury Abbey", "response": ["This may help account for the abbey's relative impunity under Stevens, who sought, through a protracted series of manoeuvres, to annex Sandwell Priory, near West Bromwich  in Staffordshire, to Shrewsbury Abbey. In so doing he got away with near-murder. Initially he encouraged one Richard Tudenham to contest the position of the elected prior, John de Kyngeston. In 1370 Kyngeston took legal action against Stevens after suffering an arrow wound in the arm during an attack by five men. In 1379 Stevens, together with two monks and a secular cleric, abducted Kyngeston and held him at a house in Sleap, north of Shrewsbury, until he signed a resignation. Bishop Robert de Stretton installed as prior of Sandwell one of the Shrewsbury monks involved in the abduction, Brother Richard Westbury. However, the conspirators fell out over the spoils, with Tudenham challenging Westbury's appointment. On Westbury's death in 1397, a successor installed by Bishop Richard le Scrope was driven out by an armed gang. Stevens seems largely to have escaped censure for his role in the affair. There can be little doubt, however, of his determination to protect and extend the interests of his abbey. It was apparently under Stevens that a party of Shrewsbury monks stole the relics of St\u00a0Beuno, St\u00a0Winifred's uncle and confessor, from Rhewl and installed them in the abbey church. Although the abbey was fined, it was allowed to keep the relics.Angold et al. Houses of Benedictine monks: Abbey of Shrewsbury, note anchor 89. It was also under Stevens that a new shrine was built for St\u00a0Winifred herself."]}, {"page": "Bishop of Lichfield", "response": ["| Robert de Stretton"]}]}}
