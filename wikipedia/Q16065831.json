Harry was the son of James Shirley Leakey (1824\u20131871), one of the eleven children of the portrait painter James Leakey. Harry Leakey was assigned to an established post of the Church Mission Society among the Kikuyu at Kabete, in the highlands north of Nairobi. The station was at that time a hut and two tents. Louis's earliest home had an earthen floor, a leaky thatched roof, rodents and insects, and no heating system except for charcoal braziers. The facilities slowly improved over time. The mission, a center of activity, set up a clinic in one of the tents, and later a girls' school. Harry was working on a translation of the Bible into the Gikuyu language. He had a distinguished career in the CMS, becoming canon of the station.Louis reports in his Memoirs, Chapter 6"]}, {"page": "Leakey", "response": ["*James Leakey (1775\u20131866), English landscape and portrait painter"]}, {"page": "Caroline Leakey", "response": ["Leakey was born in Exeter in the county of Devon, England. She was the sixth child of a large religious family of eleven children: her parents were James Leakey,  an artist, and Eliza Hubbard Woolmer.

He sat to Batoni in 1753 whilst on his grand tour in Italy. Hudson also painted portraits of his brother Denys Rolle and of his wife Anne Chichester and of his sister Christiana Maria Rolle. The portraits by Batoni and Hudson/Reynolds hung in the Victorian mansion at Stevenstone built by Mark Rolle (1836\u20131907), demolished soon after his death, and the Batoni was later donated with several other Rolle family portraits to the \"Great Torrington Almshouse, Town Lands and Poors Charities\" by his heir Lord Clinton Collection of Great Torrington Almshouse, Town Lands and Poors Charities, Rolle/Clinton Art Collection. Some of the paintings, notably that by Batoni of John Rolle Walter, are visible hanging in a corridor at Stevenstone as shown in a photograph from the sales particulars for the estate published in Rosemary Lauder's book \"Vanished Houses of Devon\", p.15 The painting hung in Torrington Town Hall virtually unnoticed for a few decades, until recognised by art valuers employed to identify saleable assets to fund building repairs of the Town Hall, the foundation stone of which had been laid by John Rolle Walter. Having become aware of the great value of the Batoni painting, the charity submitted it for auction at Christie's in 2007 with a reserve price of \u00a3300,000, but it was withdrawn at the last moment in order to allow a private offer at the same level to be made for it by the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. The latter was successful in its public appeals for funds, assisted by the famous actress Joanna Lumley, and purchased the painting in 2008. After the flurry of publicity from the fund-raising exercise had settled, as of 2013 it is now held in permanent storage by the museum and is rarely placed on public display. A full-sized photographic replica was made and is displayed in Torrington Town Hall. Due to all the publicity, the National Gallery of Denmark was at last able to identify the sitter in its own portrait by Batoni, showing Rolle in a portrait bust in the same pose, a preliminary study for the larger portrait.https://collection.smk.dk/#/en/detail/KMS6813 \"Only their studies made it possible for us to identify the person depicted.\""]}, {"page": "Rea Leakey", "response": ["Leakey was born in Nairobi, Kenya on 30 December 1915.
