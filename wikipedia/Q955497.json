A particular point of objection is Menzies' use of maps to argue that the Chinese mapped both the Eastern and Western hemispheres as they circumnavigated the world in the 15th century. The widely respected British historian of exploration Felipe Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto dismissed Menzies as \"either a charlatan or a cretin\". Sally Gaminara, the publisher for Transworld, the company which publishes Menzies's book, dismissed Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto as merely jealous, commenting, \"Well, maybe he'd like to have the same commercial success himself.\" On 21 July 2004, the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) broadcast a two-hour-long documentary debunking all of Menzies's major claims, featuring professional Chinese historians. In 2004, historian Robert Finlay severely criticized Menzies in the Journal of World History for his \"reckless manner of dealing with evidence\" that led him to propose hypotheses \"without a shred of proof\". Finlay wrote:", "Felipe Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, a professor of history at Tufts University in the United States and at Queen Mary, University of London, examined Menzies' claim that private papers of Columbus indicate a Chinese ambassador in correspondence with the Pope and called this claim \"drivel.\"  He states that no reputable scholar supports the view that Toscanelli's letter refers to a Chinese ambassador. Martin Kemp, Professor of the History of Art at Oxford University, questions the rigor of Menzies' application of the historical method, and in regard to European illustrations purporting to be copied from the Chinese Nong Shu, writes that Menzies \"says something is a copy just because they look similar.
