He got thirty replies and formed a group called \"Lunch\". He met Dave Kaffinetti in November 1968, and together they formulated the basic ideas for Rare Bird. In August 1969, they finally found the ideal rhythm section in Steve Gould, Chris Randall and Mark Ashton. Field and Kaffinetti had originally envisaged that the band would be a four-piece and were looking for a singer/bass player. Gould and Randall, who had both previously been members of the Pop-Psych band \"Fruit Machine\", applied to the advert as vocals/guitar and bass respectively and were taken on. Lunch played a few gigs; one notable one was at the Tilbury Working Mens Club for the princely sum of five pounds. The band had no van and they managed to get amps, drums, guitars and Hammond organ into their cars. The gig was marred by Randall receiving a bad electric shock whilst on stage. It later turned out that the founders of the band were more interested in Steve Gould and convinced him to play bass. Randall was now high and dry and was kicked out of the band.", "* Steve Gould \u2013 bass guitar, lead vocals", "* Steve Gould \u2013 bass guitar, lead vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 rhythm guitar, co-lead vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 rhythm electric and acoustic guitars, lead and backing vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 co-lead vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 electric and acoustic guitars, lead and backing vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 rhythm guitar, co-lead vocals, percussion", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 acoustic guitar, vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 acoustic guitar, lead and backing vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 rhythm guitar, lead and backing vocals", "#* Steve Gould \u2013 rhythm guitar, co-lead vocals, percussion", "*Steve Gould \u2013 lead vocals, guitar; bass (track 6)", "*Steve Gould \u2013 lead vocals, guitars, bass guitar; electric piano (track 10)"]}, {"page": "Runner (band)", "response": ["Runner were a short-lived British rock band, formed in 1978 out of a friendship between Steve Gould of the band Rare Bird and Alan Merrill of the band Arrows.", "Steve Gould had been touring with Merrill's live band Arrows after his band Rare Bird broke up in 1976.
