After Danny Whitaker took temporary charge, on 16 January 2020, Mark Kennedy was appointed head coach. On 29 January, three Macclesfield players (Emmanuel Osadebe, Theo Vassell and Miles Welch-Hayes) approached the EFL and had their contracts terminated ahead of the transfer deadline. Club staff wages for February were also not paid on time, leading the PFA to contact the club. On 9 March, the club was charged with misconduct by the EFL for failing to pay players on time, and was referred to an independent disciplinary commission after failing to fulfil the Crewe and Plymouth fixtures. In April 2020, it was reported that the club had not paid its players for a fifth time, failing to pay March's wages, and later that the first team, backroom staff and most office staff had been put on furlough (temporary leave) due to the COVID-19 pandemic."]}, {"page": "Cherwell School", "response": ["*Miles Welch-Hayes, footballer - Oxford United"]}, {"page": "Daventry Town F.C.", "response": ["* Miles Welch-Hayes"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["| 8 December 2016 || CB ||  || Miles Welch-Hayes || Bath City || 5 January 2017 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Oxford United F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2017 || CB ||  || Miles Welch-Hayes || Bath City || Released || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2018 || CB ||  || Miles Welch-Hayes || Bath City || Undisclosed || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["After leaving league rivals Macclesfield Town in January, defender Miles Welch-Hayes on 21 February on a free transfer.
