According to Billy Mitchell, Spence quizzed him and others sent to the Maze about why they were there, seeking an ideological answer to his question. When the prisoner was unable to provide one Spence would then seek to convince them of the wisdom of his more politicised path, something that he accomplished with Mitchell.McKay, Northern Protestants, p. 55 David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson were among the other UVF men imprisoned in the mid-1970s to become disciples of Spence.Taylor, Loyalists, pp. 141\u2013142 In 1977 he publicly condemned the use of violence for political gain, on the grounds that it was counter-productive.

Peter Taylor visited Giles' family in east Belfast on the eve of the funeral. He described Giles as lying in the coffin wearing his best suit, and his UVF badge with the inscribed words \"For God and Ulster\" was pinned to his lapel.Taylor, p.11 One of his last lines in his letter read, \"Please let the next generation live normal lives\".Taylor, p.11 This line was quoted during a speech given by Colm Cavanagh, vice-president of The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland on 3 March 2006 to The Department of Education. His friend and former UVF colleague Billy Mitchell, who was strongly critical of trauma counselling and a psychological approach to former paramilitaries, suggested that Giles' suicide had been prompted by a \"trauma workshop\" Giles had attended in South Africa. This was in contrast to Taylor, who believed that Giles took his own life because of the remorse he felt about his involvement in UVF violence."]}, {"page": "Bill Mitchell", "response": ["Bill or Billy Mitchell may refer to:", "* Billy Mitchell (saxophonist) (1926\u20132001), American jazz tenor saxophonist", "* Billy Mitchell (pianist) (born 1943), American jazz pianist", "* Billy Mitchell, performer on the Canadian television game show Acting Crazy (1991\u20131994)", "* Billy Mitchell, performer with the American rhythm and blues/doo-wop vocal group The Clovers", "* Billy Mitchell, performer with the English folk rock and progressive rock band Lindisfarne", "* Billy Mitchell, performer with the folk rock/electric folk group Jack the Lad", "* Billy Mitchell (EastEnders), fictional character from the BBC soap opera EastEnders", "* Billy Mitchell (rugby) (1890\u20131959), New Zealand rugby footballer", "* Billy Mitchell (billiards player) (1854\u20131931), player of English billiards", "* Billy Mitchell (footballer) (born 2001), English professional footballer", "* Billy Mitchell (1879\u20131936), United States Army general", "* Billy Mitchell (politician), member of the Georgia House of Representatives", "* Billy Mitchell (loyalist) (1940\u20132006), Northern Irish community activist", "* Billy Mitchell (gamer) (born 1965), American video game player", "* Billy Mitchell (volcano), a volcano in the central part of the island of Bougainville", "* Billy Mitchell Airport, a public use airport in Dare County, North Carolina"]}]}}
