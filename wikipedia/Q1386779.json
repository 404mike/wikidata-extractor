He is famous for starting as an ardent believer in natural selection who later became one of its fiercest critics. Mivart attempted to reconcile Darwin's theory of evolution with the beliefs of the Catholic Church, and finished by being condemned by both.His opposition to the central role of natural selection, his idea that the soul is created by God, and that evolutionism is not unattainable with the idea of God, brought him in contrast with other evolutionist scientists. His theological theories on hell and on the compatibility between science and Catholicism led him to clash with the Catholic Church but importantly, \"... the cause of Mivart\u2019s problems was not his advocacy of evolutionism.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Creationism", "response": ["Through the 19th century the term creationism most commonly referred to direct creation of individual souls, in contrast to traducianism.

According to Flower, the suborder Lemuroidea contained the families Lemuridae (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), Chiromyidae (aye-aye), and Tarsiidae (tarsiers). Lemuroidea was later replaced by Illiger's suborder Prosimii. Many years earlier, in 1812, \u00c9.\u00a0Geoffroy first named the suborder Strepsirrhini, in which he included the tarsiers. This taxonomy went unnoticed until 1918, when Pocock compared the structure of the nose and reinstated the use of the suborder Strepsirrhini, while also moving the tarsiers and the simians into a new suborder, Haplorhini. It was not until 1953, when British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill wrote an entire volume on strepsirrhine anatomy, that Pocock's taxonomic suggestion became noticed and more widely used.

In 1979, Thomas Michael Loome stressed the continuity between the two and talked of a \"vertical dimension\" of the modernist controversy. This \"invention of tradition\" was criticized - amongst others - by Nicholas Lash. It is clear, however, that already the Joint Pastoral of the English episcopate against \"Liberal Catholicism\" (December 1900) did not only react on St. George Jackson Mivart, but also on the writings of the later \"modernist\" George Tyrrell. The letter had been prepared in Rome and was inspired by Rafael Merry del Val who became Tyrrell's chief opponent under Pius X. Furthermore, \"modernists\" like Tyrrell compared their own difficulties after the publication of Pascendi with the difficulties of \"liberal catholics\" like Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger after Vatican I. In December 1907, Tyrrell wrote to a German correspondent: \"Is it not time to reconsider the pseudo-council of 1870 and to ask whether the Alt-Katholiks were not, after all, in the right? Ex fructibus eorum etc. [You will know them by their fruits. Matthew 7:16] may surely be used as a criterion of Ultramontanism. Individuals, like myself, can afford to stand aloof as D\u00f6llinger did. But can multitudes live without sacraments and external communion? And yet now no educated man or woman will be able to remain in communion with Pius X.\" Tyrrell was also inspired by the posthumous publication of Lord Acton's History of Freedom and Other Essays in 1907."]}, {"page": "Rejection of evolution by religious groups", "response": [" Gray said that investigation of physical causes was not opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it \"most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies.\" Thomas Huxley, who strongly promoted Darwin's ideas while campaigning to end the dominance of science by the clergy, coined the term agnostic to describe his position that God's existence is unknowable. Darwin also took this position, but prominent atheists including Edward Aveling and Ludwig B\u00fcchner also took up evolution and it was criticized, in the words of one reviewer, as \"tantamount to atheism.\" Following the lead of figures such as St. George Jackson Mivart and John Augustine Zahm, Roman Catholics in the United States became accepting of evolution itself while ambivalent towards natural selection and stressing humanity's divinely imbued soul.
