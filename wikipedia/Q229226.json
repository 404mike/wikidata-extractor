Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor. Her work is of interest to social historians as well as readers of literature. Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848. Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, published in 1857, was the first biography of Charlotte Bront\u00eb. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Bront\u00eb\u2019s life; the rest she left out, deciding that certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. Among Gaskell's best known novels are Cranford (1851\u201353), North and South (1854\u201355), and Wives and Daughters (1865), each having been adapted for television by the BBC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anne Bront\u00eb", "response": ["In Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte, Patrick remembered Anne as precocious.

Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time, as she did not want to leave her ageing father.  Thackeray's daughter, writer Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie, recalled a visit to her father by Bront\u00eb:", "Bront\u00eb's friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell, while not particularly close, was significant in that Gaskell wrote the first biography of Bront\u00eb after her death in 1855.", "Before the publication of Villette, Bront\u00eb received an expected proposal of marriage from Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's curate, who had long been in love with her. She initially turned down his proposal and her father objected to the union at least partly because of Nicholls's poor financial status. Elizabeth Gaskell, who believed that marriage provided \"clear and defined duties\" that were beneficial for a woman, encouraged Bront\u00eb to consider the positive aspects of such a union and tried to use her contacts to engineer an improvement in Nicholls's finances. According to James Pope-Hennessy in The Flight of Youth, it was the generosity of Richard Monckton Milnes that made the marriage possible. Bront\u00eb meanwhile was increasingly attracted to Nicholls and by January 1854 she had accepted his proposal. They gained the approval of her father by April and married in June. Her father Patrick had intended to give Charlotte away, but at the last minute decided he could not, and Charlotte had to make her way to the church without him. The married couple took their honeymoon in Banagher, County Offaly, Ireland. By all accounts, her marriage was a success and Bront\u00eb found herself very happy in a way that was new to her.", "Elizabeth Gaskell's biography The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb was published in 1857. It was an important step for a leading female novelist to write a biography of another, and Gaskell's approach was unusual in that, rather than analysing her subject's achievements, she concentrated on private details of Bront\u00eb's life, emphasising those aspects that countered the accusations of \"coarseness\" that had been levelled at her writing. The biography is frank in places, but omits details of Bront\u00eb's love for H\u00e9ger, a married man, as being too much of an affront to contemporary morals and a likely source of distress to Bront\u00eb's father, widower, and friends. Mrs Gaskell also provided doubtful and inaccurate information about Patrick Bront\u00eb, claiming that he did not allow his children to eat meat. This is refuted by one of Emily Bront\u00eb's diary papers, in which she describes preparing meat and potatoes for dinner at the parsonage.Juliet Barker, The Bront\u00ebs It has been argued that Gaskell's approach transferred the focus of attention away from the 'difficult' novels, not just Bront\u00eb's, but all the sisters', and began a process of sanctification of their private lives.", "* The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Elizabeth Gaskell, 1857"]}, {"page": "Cheshire", "response": ["Actors from Cheshire include Daniel Craig, Tim Curry, Pete Postlethwaite, Wendy Hiller, and Lewis McGibbon.

After Emily's death, Charlotte rewrote her character, history and even poems on a more acceptable (to her and the bourgeois reading public) model. Biographer Claire O'Callaghan suggests that the trajectory of Bront\u00eb's legacy was altered significantly by Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s biography of Charlotte, concerning not only because Gaskell did not visit Haworth until after Emily\u2019s death, but also because Gaskell admits to disliking what she did know of Emily in her biography of Charlotte.

Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Bront\u00ebs.\" In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel \u2014 while acclaiming it as \"the first presentment of that Feminist novel\", she stated that \"it bores to tears.\" Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: \"If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines.\" The only thing Sinclair wholly approved of was the author's treatment of marital laws of the time: \"Anne Bront\u00eb attacks her problem with a freedom and audacity before which her sisters\u2019 boldest enterprises seem cowardly and restrained...
