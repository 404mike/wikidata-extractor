He spent five years at Rotherham, but made just five league appearances. Despite serving a promising apprenticeship and helping the club win the Northern Intermediate Cup, he failed to dislodge Kelham O'Hanlon and then Billy Mercer as the number one keeper. After a successful loan spell at Scarborough FC at the end of 1991\u201392 season, he signed a one-year contract with the Seadogs, where he fought for the starting position with Mark Evans.Scarborough's highlight of the 1992\u201393 season was a League Cup run, which included victories over Bradford City, Coventry City, Plymouth Argyle, before going out to a Nigel Winterburn goal against Arsenal. At the end of that season he was released by Scarborough, but Ford was signed by Doncaster Rovers to be understudy to Andy Beasley. After playing a handful of games at Rovers, Ford moved back to Scarborough, but after an injury plagued season and only a few first team appearances he was to find himself without a contract at a professional club in 1995.In August 1995 he signed for non-league Gresley Rovers where he stayed for 5 years, helping them win the Southern League Championship. Due to ground grading Gresley couldn't take a place in the Conference. After winning many personal honours and establishing himself as a firm crowd favourite, he eventually moved on to Hednesford Town, Ilkeston Town and Alfreton Town, before finishing his career at AFC Barnsley. Ford helped them to promotion in his first season, losing just one league game and conceding just 18 goals.\nIn 2011, Ford launched a range of retro goalkeeping gloves.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gresley Rovers F.C.", "response": ["The 1998\u201399 season will go down in the history of Gresley Rovers as one of the worst. At the end of 1998 they were in the top six. By the end of April they were relegated. The season started well and 13 points from their September games saw them in third place just four points adrift of the leaders Nuneaton Borough. In November Gresley Rovers were drawn to meet Walsall at the Bescot Stadium in the first round of the FA Cup. Gresley went close to causing an upset but were denied at least a replay by a goal 11 minutes from the end. Victories over King's Lynn and Hastings Town got December off to a fine start; however, three defeats saw them drop to 6th place. After a disastrous run of 6 successive defeats in January saw them slump to 17th place just 5 points above the relegation places. In February two successive draws and three defeats proved to be Garry Birtles downfall and he and his assistant, Paul Fitzpatrick were dismissed. Stuart Ford took charge temporarily and saw the team beat Atherstone United 2\u20131 that ended a run of 14 games without a win. In March 1999 Brian Kenning was appointed manager. The opening game of April produced a comfortable 3\u20130 victory over Cambridge City. But three defeats followed against Nuneaton Borough, Crawley Town and Rothwell Town. Vital game at Dorchester Town and Salisbury City yielded only one point. The defeat on the final day against Bath City pushed Gresley into the Midlands Division just two years after winning the Southern League Premier Division Championship by 11 points. The last time Gresley were relegated was in the 1958\u201359 season when they went down from the Birmingham League Division one to Division two."]}, {"page": "Firth Park Academy", "response": ["* Stuart Ford, goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "Stuart Ford", "response": ["Stuart Ford may refer to:", "*Stuart Ford (footballer)", "*Stuart Ford (film producer)", "*Stuart Ford (law professor)"]}]}}
