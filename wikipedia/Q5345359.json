According to his obituary, he failed to inspire the friendship of his colleagues, but more recent evaluations have noted that he \"deserves to be better remembered by nutritionists, both for his contributions to the physiological basis of nutrition, and for his pioneering field surveys of dietary intake in relation to need among low income social groups\". He worked out that prisoners who were fed on a diet of 93% carbohydrates would not be able to perform hard labour (and would therefore be more likely to resort to crime).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heanor", "response": ["*Edward Smith (1819\u20131874), physician, medical writer and dietician, was born in Heanor."]}, {"page": "Ed Smith", "response": ["*Edward Smith (VC) (1898\u20131940), English recipient of the Victoria Cross during the First World War", "*Edward Smith (New Zealand politician) (1839\u20131907), New Zealand armourer and Liberal Party politician", "*Edward Smith (trade unionist), of Springfield, Sangamon County, Ill", "*Edward Smith (judge) (1602\u20131682), Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas", "*Edward Smith (MP) (c. 1704\u20131762), English Member of Parliament for Leicestershire, 1734\u20131762", "*Edward Smith (governor), army officer and governor of the Isle of Man", "*Sir Edward Smith, 1st Baronet (c. 1630\u20131707), English landowner and politician", "*Edward Smith (cricketer, born 1831) (1831\u20131899), English cricketer", "*Edward Smith (cricketer, born 1854) (1854\u20131909), English cricketer and clergyman", "*Edward Smith (cricketer, born 1911) (1911\u20131999), Australian cricketer", "*Edward Smith (physician) (1819\u20131874), physician and medical writer", "*Edward Smith (biographer) (1839\u20131919), English biographer", "*Edward Smith (sea captain) (1850\u20131912), captain of the RMS Titanic when she sank", "*Edward Smith (thief), committed one of the first bank robberies in the United States"]}, {"page": "Queen's College, Birmingham", "response": ["* Edward Smith, physician and medical writer"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|Alan Edward Smith||20/05/2010|| Geneticist", "|Edward Smith||19/01/1738||fl 1738", "|Edward Smith||27/01/1664||fl 1664\u20131668", "|Edward Smith||07/06/1860||c. 1818 \u2013 16 November 1874", "|Edward Smith||29/04/1696||1665 \u2013 4 November 1720 Bishop of Down & Connor", "|Frank Edward Smith||02/05/1918||14 October 1876 \u2013 1 July 1970", "|James Edward Smith||26/05/1785||2 December 1759 \u2013 17 March 1828"]}, {"page": "Orr's Circle of the Sciences", "response": ["|Botany, Edward SmithZoology, William Sweetland Dallas", "|William Sweetland Dallas; Edward Smith's name is on the title page, but for \"Botany\"."]}]}}
