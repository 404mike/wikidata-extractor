According to his obituary, he failed to inspire the friendship of his colleagues, but more recent evaluations have noted that he \"deserves to be better remembered by nutritionists, both for his contributions to the physiological basis of nutrition, and for his pioneering field surveys of dietary intake in relation to need among low income social groups\". He worked out that prisoners who were fed on a diet of 93% carbohydrates would not be able to perform hard labour (and would therefore be more likely to resort to crime).", "link_mentions": {}}}
