Born into a family with an English father and a Spanish mother, she attended the University College London to read modern languages and later studied a Doctor of Philosophy art degree under Tancred Borenius. Harris travelled to Spain to research Caravaggio's influence on 17th-century Spanish paintings and her first book was published in 1938. She billeted Basque child refugees during the Spanish Civil War and worked with the Ministry of Information to keep Spain neutral during World War II. After the war ended she worked in the Warburg Institute and was offered the post in their photographic collection in 1947. Harris worked there until her retirement albeit for two years when she was married to the institution's director Henri Frankfort. Her work on Spanish paintings earned her widespread recognition in the country and received multiple awards and honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diego Vel\u00e1zquez", "response": ["*Davies, David and Enriqueta Harris (1996) Vel\u00e1zquez in Seville National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, ;"]}, {"page": "Warburg Institute", "response": ["Scholars associated with the Warburg Institute include Ernst Cassirer, Rudolf Wittkower, Otto Kurz, Henri Frankfort, Arnaldo Momigliano, Ernst Gombrich, Erwin Panofsky, Edgar Wind, Frances Yates, Enriqueta Harris, D.

Being either born with a deformity or deformed on purpose at the time of birth, court jesters became slaves to the royal court and family. Because they were seen as entertainment, dwarfs were no longer painted as symbolic figures and instead with a realistic style. Since dwarfs were so prominent in court life, they were also included in paintings with multiple figures Previous Spanish court painters before Vel\u00e1zquez painted dwarfs with coldness carelessness, since dwarfs were seen as human pets. Dwarfs were also painted with extreme stiffness and disdain for them was also visible in their portraits. Court dwarfs were portrayed in paintings as the property of their masters, being summoned back and forth at their master's request. Typically, dwarfs were painted as being obedient and as under the ownership of their masters by placing their hands on the dwarf's head. Dwarfs were seen as only one class higher than animals status-wise. Dwarfs were often painted holding an animal of some kind when with their masters. However, dwarfs with artistic or literature abilities were spared from having to train and play with animals. Art historian Enriqueta Harris stated that Vel\u00e1zquez's paintings of dwarfs did not belong in the same space as classical paintings that he had done as well.  However, Catherine Closet-Crane, author of a critical essay about Vel\u00e1zquez's dwarf portraits, states that the portraits were in fact meant to be seen with other Vel\u00e1zquez portraits. She even discusses that the portraits could also be seen alongside some of Rubens's portraits, such as of philosophers Democritus and Heraclitus. Dwarfs were commonly painted from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, but their prominence in art declined afterwards."]}, {"page": "Juan Mateos (courtier)", "response": ["Mateos' likeness is known through a bust portrait engraved by Pedro Perete that appears on the front of Origen y dignidad de la ca\u00e7a, one of whose illustrations is signed by painter Francisco Collantes. Based on that engraving, art historian Carl Justi identified Mateos as the model of an unfinished portrait of a gentleman cut below the waist painted by Vel\u00e1zquez around 1632 (Don Juan Mateos, in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister), and, in the opinion of Enriqueta Harris, Mateos is one of the characters depicted with the Count-Duke of Olivares and Alonso Mart\u00ednez de Espinar in Prince Baltasar Carlos in the Riding School."]}]}}
