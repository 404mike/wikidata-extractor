Brown", "response": ["In 1907 Brown accepted a call to co-pastor Metropolitan Tabernacle with C.H. Spurgeon's son, Thomas. After the father's death, attendance had fallen, and Thomas Spurgeon was overwhelmed by the number of agencies and institutions his father had created as satellites of church.  The co-pastorate was dissolved in 1908 when Thomas Spurgeon resigned for reasons of health, and Brown accepted the role of sole pastor.  By 1910 Brown himself was himself ill, and he resigned at the end of the year, though he continued to preach occasionally even after the American, A. C. Dixon, had been called as pastor.Murray, 259-73.  In 1911 Brown sailed to South Africa, where one of his daughters was a missionary, and then to Tasmania.  In 1913 he was supplying the Baptist church in Sandown, Isle of Wight; but the following year he left again for South Africa, serving as pastor of the Wale Street Baptist Church in Cape Town.Murray, 307-22. The Wale Street Baptist Church is the predecessor of the current Cape Town Baptist Church .  At the end of World War I, Brown returned to England and \"after many months of weakness and suffering,\" he died on 2 April 1922, nine days after his fourth wife.Murray, 329-32."]}, {"page": "Auckland Baptist Tabernacle", "response": ["The Auckland Baptist Tabernacle was formed by Richard Shalders and 14 others in 1855 in the then fledgling colonial town of Auckland. By the late 1860s, a sizeable chapel had been built on Wellesley Street and the church flourished. In 1881, Thomas Spurgeon, son of the famous C. H. Spurgeon, accepted the role of pastor and the church rapidly outgrew first the Wellesley Street Chapel, and then the Symonds Street Choral Hall.", "Thomas Spurgeon's non-identical twin brother Charles was the pastor of the Greenwich Baptist Church. As Greenwich is renowned as centre of time keeping the congregation possibly felt it was appropriate to present the Auckland Tabernacle with a clock manufactured in Greenwich. This clock is still a feature of the auditorium."]}, {"page": "Spurgeon, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Spurgeon"]}]}}
