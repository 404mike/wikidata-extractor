With his stage career now over, the couple moved to 260 Longfellow Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, where he founded Major's Garden Ornaments, manufacturing garden gnomes and other garden ornaments. The couple had four children: Thomas Aston (b. June 1929, who died shortly after birth), Pat Major-Ball (later Dessoy) (b. 1930), Terry Major-Ball (b. July 1932), and John Major (b. 29 March 1943). The ornaments business prospered and the family achieved a reasonable middle-class standard of living, described by John Major as being \"comfortable but not well off.\" The family owned a car, and both Pat and Terry were able to go to private school. This was not to last however, as World War II saw the business lose most of its customers and suppliers."]}]}}
