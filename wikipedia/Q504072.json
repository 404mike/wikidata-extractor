Born in Arbroath, Benson started his career as an apprentice at Manchester City. He turned professional in 1961, and made 44 league appearances over the next three seasons before being sold to Fourth Division side Torquay United in 1964. He was a regular in the first team during his whole spell with Torquay, helping the club win promotion to the Third Division in the 1965\u201366 season.\nIn 1970, Benson joined John Bond's Fourth Division side Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, where he was part of another promotion winning side in the 1970\u201371 season. He had a short spell on loan with Exeter City in 1973, and later that year moved to Norwich City, who had recently appointed John Bond as their new manager. He spent just over a year at the club before returning to Bournemouth in January 1975 as player-manager, but couldn't prevent the club's relegation to the Fourth Division at the end of the season. In his first full season in charge, the club came close to regaining promotion to the Third Division, but two less successful seasons followed, and Benson resigned in 1978.\nOver the next three decades, Benson worked in a wide variety of different coaching and scouting roles. He was appointed as caretaker manager of Manchester City in 1983, but was replaced at the end of the season after the club were relegated. He became manager at Burnley a year later, but was sacked after suffering another relegation. He was also in charge of Wigan Athletic during the 1999\u20132000 season, narrowly missing out on promotion after the team were defeated in the 2000 Second Division play-off Final. He died in October 2010, aged 67, following a short illness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wigan Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Following a mid-table finish in Division Two the following season, Deehan quit to become Steve Bruce's assistant at Sheffield United. He was succeeded by Ray Mathias, who returned for his third stint as Wigan Athletic manager. Mathias' team won the Football League Trophy in 1999, beating Millwall 1\u20130 at Wembley Stadium. The same season the Latics reached the Division Two play-offs, losing 2\u20131 on aggregate to Manchester City. Mathias was sacked, and replaced by John Benson. He led the team to the top of Division Two in his first six months, but they were only able to qualify for the play-offs. In what was the last ever Division Two play-off final to be played at the old Wembley Stadium, Wigan lost 3\u20132 after extra time to Gillingham.", "| John Benson"]}, {"page": "Burnley F.C.", "response": ["The team were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in 1979\u201380. Under the management of former Burnley player Brian Miller, they returned to the second tier as champions in 1981\u201382. However, this return was short-lived and lasted only one year. Managerial changes continued to be made in a search for success; Miller was replaced by Frank Casper in early 1983, he by John Bond before the 1983\u201384 season and Bond himself by John Benson a season later.Simpson (2007), pp. 550\u2013554 Bond was the first manager since Frank Hill (1948\u20131954) without a previous playing career at the club. He was criticised by the fans for signing expensive players increasing Burnley's debt, and for selling the young talents Lee Dixon, Brian Laws and Trevor Steven.Quelch (2017), pp. 24\u201339 Benson was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time at the end of the 1984\u201385 season.

He then managed to keep Norwich in the top flight, despite the financial constraints he was under, until resigning to manage Manchester City in October 1980, taking his assistants John Benson and John Sainty with him.", "The end of his first season in charge at Maine Road saw Bond lead City out at Wembley for the FA Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur, which they lost 3\u20132 in the replay game, made famous by Ricky Villa's goal (the game also featured a volley by City's Steve MacKenzie). Bond resigned from City in February 1983, with the side ninth in the table. Thereafter, under John Benson, City plummeted towards the relegation zone and were relegated on the final day.", "He then worked as a football commentator for BBC Radio Five Live, before returning to coaching, assisting his son Kevin who was manager at Stafford Rangers, mainly in a scouting capacity. In November 1998, Bond was appointed manager at Witton Albion, who were struggling in the Northern Premier League First Division, but eventually finished in a healthy eighth place. In September 1999, Bond, by now nearing his 67th birthday, was brought out of retirement by Wigan Athletic manager John Benson to assist with coaching and scouting in a consultancy position. He left Wigan after less than 12 months following Benson's move to the role of director of football."]}]}}
