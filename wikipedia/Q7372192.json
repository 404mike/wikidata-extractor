This made him returning officer for Cumberland, a position of advantage to support Lowther's electioneering. Lonsdale had gained control of the corporation of Carlisle in 1784, and arranged for the creation of 1,400 mostly non-resident freemen of the city, largely selected from among his tenantry and outnumbering the existing freemen two-to-one. His opportunity to test his electoral strength there came in 1786, when the Earl of Surrey, sitting member and leader of the opposition to Lonsdale there, succeeded as Duke of Norfolk and vacated his seat. Lonsdale put forth Knubley as a candidate for Carlisle at the ensuing by-election of 29 November 1786. Knubley outpolled his rival Rowland Stephenson 554 to 405, but the election was overturned on petition on 26 February 1787 and Stephenson was seated.
