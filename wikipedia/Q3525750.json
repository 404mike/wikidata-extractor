In 1885, he played two matches as a professional for Victoria, and then, when Billy Barnes was ruled out of a number of matches in Alfred Shaw's tour of Australia in 1886-87 after Barnes hit a wall rather than Australian captain Percy McDonnell, whom he was aiming for, the Englishmen had to find a replacement quickly. Wood was found and played three matches for Shaw's XI, the second one of which was the Second Test. He did not bowl and batted at number ten, scoring 0 and 6 and after one final game with the touring Englishmen never played first-class cricket again.\nHis life story is covered in the book Finally a Face: A Memoir of Reginald Wood by Philip Paine, which was published in 2007.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Reginald Wood \u00b7"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Reginald Wood (1860\u20131915), English cricketer who played one Test and 12 first-class matches"]}, {"page": "List of Victoria first-class cricketers", "response": ["||177||Reginald Wood||6 November 1886||1886/87||2"]}, {"page": "Birkenhead Park Cricket Club", "response": ["During the period, Park also had two amateur players who would tour Australia with England and play one test each.
