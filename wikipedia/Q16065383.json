In 1846-47 he held the office of Sheriff of London and Middlesex and was Lord Mayor of London in 1856\u201357.A member of the Worshipful Company of Butchers, he was master of the company in 1839.In June 1852 a general election was called and a group of 500 electors in the Clerkenwell area presented a petition to Challis requesting that he stand for election to parliament for the constituency of Finsbury. He consented to become a candidate, declaring that if elected he would \"exercise his own judgement, and, opposing all class legislation, he should make truth the basis of his conduct, and the happiness of the people his object.\" There were three candidates for the two-seat constituency, and Challis was elected along with his fellow Liberal, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe. He served a single term, standing down at the next general election in 1857.\nOn Michaelmas Day 1852 Challis was elected by the Corporation of London as Lord Mayor of London. He took office on 9 November, although the traditional Lord Mayor's Show was not held as the City was preparing to hold the state funeral of the Duke of Wellington.He died at his country home in Enfield, Middlesex, and was buried at Enfield Chase Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of lord mayors of London", "response": ["| 1852 || Thomas Challis, MP || Butcher ||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1852 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Challis||Liberal"]}, {"page": "Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Challis"]}, {"page": "Richard Coeur de Lion (statue)", "response": ["The future location of the statue was a contentious issue from the outset, with Fox's proposal of a site in Hyde Park being sidelined in favour of leaving the site open for future consideration. The appropriateness of its theme in relation to the Great Exhibition was also questioned. The Art Journal pointed out the contradiction between \"the effigy of a valiant crusader\" and \"the great Peace congress of 1851\" and asked why \"a foreign sculptor alone\" was being selected to commemorate a British exhibition. The Lord Mayor of London, Thomas Challis, was similarly critical, declaring that the statue depicted \"muscular power and the almost savage ferocity of war ..., while ... the Great Exhibition afforded an example of the cordial amity of nations.\" His criticism was perhaps not unrelated to the fact that he was promoting a rival scheme to commemorate the Exhibition. Others criticised the statue's lack of realism. As The Times observed after the statue's installation, the sculptor \"sacrificed probabilities in the close fit he has given to Richard's mail shirt, which is made to display the swelling biceps and folded mass of pectoral muscle as accurately as a knitted woollen jersey.\""]}, {"page": "Robert Kennard", "response": ["Kennard married Mary Ann Challis, only child of Liberal MP and later Lord Mayor of London Thomas Challis, on 23 May 1823.
