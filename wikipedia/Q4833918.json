Phillips was one of four Cardiff players in the first match, along with B. B. Mann, Barry Girling and Leonard Watkins. The Welsh team were humiliated when the English scored 13 tries without reply, and the press attacked the Welsh Union secretary Richard Mullock for choosing a 'private' team of friends and elitists rather than the best players available.Smith (1980), pg 470. Phillips himself was a strong supporter of Mulloch, and when Mulloch was challenged in his position as secretary, it was Phillips, along with Horace Lyne, who voiced their opinion strongest in his support.Smith (1980), pg 52."]}, {"page": "1880\u201381 Home Nations rugby union matches", "response": ["Wales: Charlie Newman (Newport), Richard Summers (Haverfordwest), James Bevan (Cambridge Uni. and Newport) capt., Edward Peake (Newport and Chepstow), Leonard Watkins (Llandaff and Cardiff), Edward John Lewis (Llandovery College), Barry Girling (Cardiff), Aneurin Rees (Llandovery College), Frank Purdon (Swansea) B.

At the time Wales did not have an international team, and after the challenge was accepted by the Rugby Football Union, Mullock needed to select a team quickly. Watkins was one of four players who represented Cardiff to be selected for the team, alongside B. B. Mann, Barry Girling and William David Phillips. The Welsh team that arrived to play England at Blackheath were completely unprepared for the game; there had been no trial and most of the team were unfamiliar with each other's style of play. The game was a one-sided affair, with England humiliating Wales in an 8-goal victory.

The team selection for the Wales squad was undertaken in a hurry, as the match organiser, Richard Mullock, had broken away from the South Wales Football Union to arrange the match with England. With no real links to any of the clubs outside Newport and Cardiff, Mullock chose a team made up of gentlemen players with connections to the old universities. Four members of Cardiff RFC were chosen for the Welsh team, club captain William David Phillips, vice-captain B. B. Mann, Leonard Watkins and Girling. The Welsh team were unprepared for the far more experienced and well drilled England team, and ended the match losing by eight goals to nil, a humiliating result. When the second Welsh international was arranged against Ireland the next year, eleven of the original squad were not reselected. Girling was one of those dropped, and never represented Wales again."]}, {"page": "Edward John Lewis", "response": ["When Newport Athletic secretary, Richard Mullock, was successful in gaining an agreed fixture from the Rugby Football Union between the English team and a yet to be formed Wales side; he had a short period to recruit a Welsh team. Mullock had future plans to form a Welsh Rugby Union, so selected a team of 'gentlemen players' that represented a wide spread of clubs from around Wales. Lewis was not only an ex-Cambridge student, having graduated from Christ's College but also represented Llandovery, and was called up to represent the first Welsh team.Smith (1980), pg 40. Lewis was placed at the key position of half-back, paired with Llandaff's Leonard Watkins. The game was a disaster for the Welsh team. The team was badly organised, having never played together before, and several players out of position. In the first ten minutes of the start of the game, both Lewis and Wales forward B. B. Mann were injured, both eventually leaving the field of play before the final whistle.Smith (1980), pg 57. Wales were totally out-classed, losing by eight goals to nil, and Lewis never represented his country again."]}, {"page": "Bathurst Bellers Mann", "response": ["#REDIRECT B. B. Mann"]}]}}
