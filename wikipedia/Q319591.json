He has won seven Grand Tours: four editions of the Tour de France (in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017), one Giro d'Italia (2018) and the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a twice (2011 and 2017). He has also won several other stage races, and the Velo d'Or three times.\nFroome has also won two Olympic bronze medals in road time trials, in 2012 and 2016, and also took bronze in the 2017 World Championships. Froome was born in Kenya to British parents and grew up there and in South Africa. Since 2011 he's been a resident in Monaco. At the age of 22, Froome turned professional with Team Konica Minolta. In 2008, he joined the team Barloworld. The same year he moved to Italy and started to ride under a British licence. In 2010, he moved to Team Sky and quickly became one of the team's key cyclists. Froome made his breakthrough as a Grand Tour contender during the 2011 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a where he finished second overall, later promoted to first, retrospectively becoming the first British cyclist to win a Grand Tour cycling event. At the 2012 Tour de France, riding as a super-domestique for Bradley Wiggins, Froome won stage seven and finished second overall, behind Wiggins.\nHis first recognised multi-stage race win came in 2013, in the Tour of Oman, followed by wins in the Crit\u00e9rium International, the Tour de Romandie, the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, and the Tour de France. In the 2014 Tour de France, he retired after multiple crashes. In 2015, he won his second Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 and his second Tour de France. He won a third Tour de France in 2016 and became the first man since Miguel Indur\u00e1in in 1995 to successfully defend his title. He won his fourth Tour de France in 2017, followed by successive wins at the 2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and the 2018 Giro d'Italia, his first victories in both races. These achievements made him the first cyclist to win the Tour\u2013Vuelta double since the Vuelta was moved to September, the first rider to achieve any Grand Tour double in nearly a decade, and the first to hold all three Grand Tour winners' jerseys at the same time since Bernard Hinault in 1983.\nThroughout his career Froome has faced a series of allegations that he exploited a loophole in cycling's anti-doping regulations to use a performance-enhancing drug.\nIn 2019 a serious training crash before the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 halted Froome's career, after he broke numerous bones including his pelvis, femur and four ribs. Although he managed to recover following surgery to return to the peloton in 2020, he struggled to regain any of his former form. He left Ineos Grenadiers at the end of 2020 to join Israel Start-Up Nation but his form struggles continued through the 2021 season, with Froome failing to contend seriously in stage races since his accident.

The writer Roger St Pierre said:", "Recent developments in the compositions of the rosters of leading teams have led to an increasing number of high-status riders fulfilling super-domestique duties, especially during the Grand Tours. This approach was largely originated by Team Sky, beginning with their success at the 2012 Tour de France, where Chris Froome finished second on the overall podium behind his teammate and compatriot Bradley Wiggins. This finish came after some tension between the two lead riders, in particular during Stage 17 of the race, where Froome was forced to wait for Wiggins - his defined team leader - three times on the climb to the summit finish at Peyragudes, allowing Alejandro Valverde to win the stage, while both Wiggins and Froome cemented their overall general classifications standings. Following this, a number of teams have adopted fluid, or shared team leadership at the Tour de France and the other Grand Tours. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 editions of the Tour de France all saw Sky - in 2019, changing sponsorship to become known as  - successfully capture the yellow jersey, while a second rider from the team finished elsewhere within the top four: 2017 saw Froome win, with Mikel Landa coming fourth; in 2018, Geraint Thomas won his first Tour de France, while Froome finished third; and in 2019, Egan Bernal, who had himself served as a super-domestique to Froome and Thomas the previous year, subsequently finished first himself, with Thomas finishing second.", "Domestiques sometimes get a chance to win stages in stage racing.  Typically this would be late in a stage race. Domestiques whose standings do not threaten the leaders will often not be chased if they break away. Domestiques can progress to more senior roles if they show ability. For example, at the 2012 Tour de France Tejay van Garderen of BMC Racing Team began the tour as a domestique for 2011 winner Cadel Evans but later became team leader due to Evans struggling and eventually won the young rider classification.  Chris Froome of Team Sky also won a stage while riding in support of winner Bradley Wiggins, and became team leader the following year, where he eventually won the general classification."]}]}}
