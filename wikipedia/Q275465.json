Allied with Joseph Chamberlain's Liberal Unionists, he encouraged Unionist activism in Ireland. Balfour also helped the poor by creating the Congested Districts Board for Ireland in 1890. Balfour downplayed the factor of Irish nationalism, arguing that the real issues were economic. Regarding ownership and control of the land, he believed that once violence was suppressed and land was sold to the tenants, Irish nationalism would no longer threaten the unity of the United Kingdom. The slogan \"to kill home rule with kindness\" characterized Balfour's new policy toward Ireland.Catherine B. Shannon, Arthur J. Balfour and Ireland, 1874\u20131922 (1988) pp 281\u2013288. The Liberals had begun land sales to Irish tenants with the Land Law (Ireland) Act 1881 and this was expanded by the Conservatives in the land purchase scheme of 1885.  However the depression in agriculture kept prices low. Balfour's solution was to keep selling land and in 1887 lowering rents to match the lower prices, and protected more tenants against eviction by their landlords.Zebel, 60-77. Balfour greatly expanded the land sales. They culminated in the final Unionist land purchase programme of 1903,  when Balfour was prime minister and George Wyndham was the Irish secretary.  It encouraged landlords the sell by means of a 12% cash bonus. Tenants were encouraged to buy with a low interest rate, and payments drawn out over 68 years. In 1909, Liberal legislation required compulsory sales in certain cases. As the landlords sold out, they relocated to Britain, giving up their political power in Ireland. Tensions in the countryside dramatically declined as some 200,000 peasant proprietors owned about half the land in Ireland. After 1890 violence declined sharply, and as Balfour had hoped, Irish nationalism was a relatively minor factor. The situation suddenly was transformed when the Easter rebellion of 1916 radicalized Ireland.Lawrence J. McCaffrey, The Irish Question 1800\u20131922 (1968) pp 129\u2013133, 167.L. P.
