Stephenson's first season at the club was disrupted by two severe injuries \u2013 a broken arm and hairline fracture of the leg. During his three seasons at Bootham Crescent, Stephenson established himself as York's first choice right winger and he made just under 100 appearances for the club, scoring five times. Little reluctantly placed him on the transfer list along with several other first-team players in order to raise much-needed funds before his contract ran out. Hartlepool, along with his former club Brentford, both made offers, but Little delayed the transfer in order to try and use the winger to help aid York's play-off bid. York failed to make the play-offs, however, and Stephenson took the opportunity to move closer to his Newcastle roots and joined Hartlepool in March 1998."]}]}}
