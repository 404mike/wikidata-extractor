He became interested in the manufacture of terracotta around 1839 when he engaged J. G. Bubb on experimental terracotta work for model cottages at Canford Magna, Dorset. This appears to have led to his manufacturing terracotta ornamentation for buildings. In the early 1840s he supplied an extensive series of gothic terracotta mouldings for the English church at Bagni di Lucca in Tuscany.  In the mid 1840s he started working with leading English sculptors, most notably John Bell and William Theed the Younger, for whom he produced terracotta versions of sculptures which were originally sculpted in marble or cast in iron.thumb|Garthmyl Hall Pediment showing terracotta including armorial and ornamented chimney stacks designed by J.K.

As result of the popularity of terracotta pieces at the Great Exhibition of 1851, he turned increasingly towards the manufacture of garden furniture, parapets and urns.
