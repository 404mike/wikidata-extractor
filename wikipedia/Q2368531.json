Characteristically, it incorporates influences from the bleak, noisy sound and aesthetics of early industrial music acts, particularly Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle. American industrial music label Wax Trax! also had a profound influence over the genre's development. The genre has seen a resurgence in the 2010s, spearheaded by acts such as Adam X, Orphx, and Ancient Methods, and others later like Blawan and Karenn. As a result, it has gained a significant fanbase from the post-dubstep audience. It is not to be mistaken with Techno Industrial, which is in essence similar to the power noise/rhythmic noise subgenre. The different terminology is used depending if one is coming from a techno perspective or industrial perspective, with Industrial Techno having more techno-inspired rhythmic section with many reverb and wall-of-noise or sci-fi effects, while Techno Industrial is closer to rhythmic noise in composition, with a distorted rhythmic section. Other artists associated with industrial techno include Cut Hands, Helena Hauff, Forward Strategy Group, Surgeon, Michael Forshaw, Jeff Mills, Regis, Dominick Fernow and Mike Banks.
