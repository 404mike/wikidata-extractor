Relations between father and son were sometimes difficult, and on at least one occasion George removed himself from the business.   After 1857, he became more confident of his position in the firm, increasingly steering its progress.   An early \"find\" was Wilkie Collins.  During the 1860s George Bentley identified and published a number of other authors who later achieved notability.  He became increasingly influential and knowledgeable as a publisher of fiction, formally taking control of the business after his father's death in 1871.Bentley also diversified successfully into magazine publishing, exploiting the synergies available from simultaneously publishing novels serialized in monthly servings and thereafter in book form.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marie Corelli", "response": ["Corelli was known to fabricate or exaggerate many details of her life. For example, she consistently claimed (in public and in private) that she had been seventeen years old when her first novel, A Romance of Two Worlds, was published in 1886, putting her year of birth at 1868 or 1869. This was repeated in contemporary biographies, though it is now believed that she was born in 1855. When she assumed the name \"Marie Corelli\" at the beginning of her career, she also took on a false backstory, writing to her first publisher, George Bentley, \"I am Venetian and can trace myself back to the famous musician Arcangelo Corelli\", and on other occasions claimed to descend from the Doges of Venice."]}, {"page": "Wormwood: A Drama of Paris", "response": ["Corelli sent the manuscript for Wormwood to her long-time publisher George Bentley on 12 July 1890. She intended the novel to have a more realist style than her previous works, describing it to Bentley as \"a study \u00e0 la Balzac\". Bentley requested that she excise some of the novel's more lurid scenes, such as one of two scenes set in the morgue; privately, he referred to Wormwood in his diary as \"this repulsive book of hers\". Corelli signed a contract with Bentley on 1 September, receiving \u00a3100 as an advance, \u00a3300 on publication, and 6 shillings per copy after sales passed 1,500. The book was published in November 1890 in three volumes.", "Wormwood was an immediate commercial success, with the first edition selling out in ten days. Though, according to George Bentley, some readers were so scandalised by the book that they were returning it to booksellers."]}, {"page": "A Romance of Two Worlds", "response": ["Corelli composed A Romance of Two Worlds in 1885. She sent the story to publisher George Bentley. Bentley took an interest in the book after receiving highly divided reports from readers, including a very negative one from novelist Hall Caine\u2014an act that began a lifelong feud between Caine and Corelli.", "The book was not well reviewed by critics, a circumstance which publisher George Bentley anticipated, writing to Corelli that \"I think it will provoke much adverse criticism\". A critic for The World wrote that \"as a pure romance... the book is a tolerable thing enough. If the writer intends us to take it seriously\u2014as her preface seems half to suggest\u2014it is pure bosh.\" Another single-line review simply read \"Miss Corelli would have been better advised had she embodied her ridiculous ideas in a sixpenny pamphlet.\" The Athenaeum gave measured praise, writing that \"considered as a romance, pure and simple, it may entertain its readers not a little.\""]}, {"page": "Richard Bentley (publisher)", "response": ["In 1823, Bentley married Charlotte Botten (1800\u20131871), daughter of Thomas Botten by his wife, Kezia Francis. They had nine children, one of whom, their eldest surviving son, George Bentley (1828\u20131895), joined his father in the printing business.", "George Bentley joined his father's firm in 1845, but he did not become an active partner until the 1850s.Wallins, 51.", "In 1867, Bentley experienced a \"severe accident\" at Chepstow railway station that left him \"shaken and enfeebled\" (he broke his leg after falling from the platform at the railway station). George took over the day-to-day business of the firm. Bentley died on 10 September 1871 at Ramsgate, at which time his firm was renamed \"Richard Bentley and Son\". George Bentley was also named one of the executors of Bentley's will, along with two of his other children, Frederick Bentley and Anne Kezia Bentley. Richard Bentley was buried in the family vault in West Norwood Cemetery, London, on 18 September 1871."]}, {"page": "The Copyright Association", "response": ["In the early 1870s, English publishers were especially concerned to protect the rights of their authors in Canada, since the Canadian Government was pressing for the right to reprint British works in Canada subject to an excise duty.Catherine Seville, The internationalisation of copyright law: books, buccaneers and the black flag in the nineteenth century, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.97-102 The association's initial committee included both authors (including Robert Browning, Arthur Helps, William Smith, Charles Reade and Charles Edward Trevelyan) and publishers (including John Murray (1808-1892), Thomas Longman (1804-1879), Alexander Macmillan, George Bentley (1818-1895) and George Routledge).Copyright Association, The Times, 20 March 1872, p.12"]}, {"page": "George Bentley", "response": ["George Bentley may refer to:", "* George Bentley (publisher), English publisher", "* George Bentley (politician), Canadian politician", "* George Bentley (Shortland Street), fictional character"]}, {"page": "Vendetta!", "response": ["Marie Corelli's publisher, George Bentley advised her that her second novel should avoid the supernatural themes which occupied her first, A Romance of Two Worlds. Corelli sent the manuscript for Vendetta to Bentley on 8 March 1886, just two weeks after the publication of A Romance of Two Worlds. Bentley was happy with the story, though he advised that it be condensed in places, and he gave it the title Vendetta, rather than Corelli's original choice, Buried Alive. Corelli signed a contract with Bentley on 19 July, receiving 50 pounds immediately, plus an additional 50 conditional on sales reaching 550 copies. She dedicated the book to the popular actor Wilson Barrett. The book was published in August 1886."]}, {"page": "Reminiscences (Carlyle)", "response": ["The publication shortly after Carlyle's death of Froude's edition of the Reminiscences, and also of the first volumes of his biography of Carlyle and his edition of Jane Carlyle's letters, provoked a hostile and lasting critical reaction which became known as the Froude-Carlyle controversy.  The \"hail-storm of criticism\", as Froude described it, was in part directed at himself for his failure to excise passages that might harm Carlyle's reputation, with one letter to The Times comparing his editorial technique to that of a carter dumping a load of bricks.  And Carlyle's reputation did indeed suffer considerably.  Exception was taken to various contemptuous references to past acquaintances, especially Charles Lamb and Basil Montagu, to the overly laudatory portrait of Carlyle's father, and to the overly critical one of Jeffrey.  Most damagingly, readers found in the Reminiscences an unfamiliar Carlyle, morose, harsh, self-pitying and self-indulgent.  The book presented, according to the reviewer in The Spectator, \"a picture with almost a permanent scowl on it\".  J. C. Morison, a former disciple of Carlyle, complained in The Fortnightly Review that the Reminiscences showed him \"inwardly bankrupt of faith, hope and charity, looking on the world with moody anger and querulous unsatisfied egotism\".  George Bentley, in Temple Bar, wrote that \"probably in English literature there is nowhere to be found written by a man so eminent and so religiously minded, a more unkind, splenetic and scornful book\".  Several years later The Bookseller characterized the publication of Carlyle's Reminiscences as \"the shattering of the idol\"."]}]}}
