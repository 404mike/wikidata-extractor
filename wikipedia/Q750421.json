But in the 1950s, such a rich selection was not yet available. The classic fairy and folk tales were most often found in cumbersome books with small print and few illustrations. Helen Jones, then children's book editor at Little, Brown and Company, accepted a proposal from a Boston librarian for an ambitious series with a simple goal\u2014to put an international selection of stories into the hands of children. The tales would be published in slim volumes, with wide margins and ample leading, and illustrated by a cast of contemporary artists. The result was a unique series of books intended for children to read by themselves\u2014the Favorite Fairy Tales series. Available only in hardcover for many years, the books have now been reissued in paperbacks that feature new illustrations and covers. | The series embraces the stories of sixteen different countries: Czechoslovakia, Denmark, England, India, France, Italy, Ireland, Germany, Greece, Japan, Scotland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Spain and Russia. Some of these stories may seem violent or fantastical to our modern sensibilities, yet they often reflect the deepest yearnings and imaginings of the human mind and heart. Virginia Haviland traveled abroad frequently and was able to draw upon librarians, storytellers, and writers in countries as far away as Japan to help her make her selections. But she was also an avid researcher with a keen interest in rare books, and most of the stories she included in the series were found through a diligent search of old collections. Ms. Haviland was associated with the Boston Public Library for nearly thirty years\u2014as a children's and branch librarian, and eventually as Readers Advisor to Children. She reviewed for The Horn Book Magazine for almost thirty years and in 1963 was named Head of the Children's Book Section of the Library of Congress. Ms. Haviland remained with the Library of Congress for nearly twenty years, and wrote and lectured about children's literature throughout her career. She died in 1988.\""]}, {"page": "Blair Babe", "response": ["| 49. || Helen Jones || Warrington North || 1997 || 2019 || Retired"]}, {"page": "Brown ministry", "response": ["| Helen Jones", "| Helen Jones"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Jones", "response": ["*Helen Jones (born 1954), British Labour Party politician", "*Helen Jones (born 1954), British Labour Party politician"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2010 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Warrington North||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Labour||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Helen Jones\u00a0(L)|| Seat held"]}, {"page": "2010 Labour Party leadership election (UK)", "response": ["*Ed Balls (33): David Anderson, Ian Austin, Tom Blenkinsop, Kevin Brennan, Lyn Brown, Vernon Coaker, Yvette Cooper, David Crausby, Jim Cunningham, Jim Dobbin, Mike Dugher, Andrew Gwynne, John Healey, Stephen Hepburn, Sharon Hodgson, Diana Johnson, Helen Jones, Eric Joyce, Barbara Keeley, Chris Leslie, Khalid Mahmood, Steve McCabe, Kerry McCarthy, Teresa Pearce, John Robertson, Geoffrey Robinson, Marsha Singh, Andrew Smith, John Spellar, Tom Watson, David Wright, Iain Wright", "| Helen Jones || Ed Balls || Ed Miliband || David Miliband || None || None"]}, {"page": "Helen Jones (disambiguation)", "response": ["Helen Jones is a British Labour politician.", "Helen Jones may also refer to:", "*Helen Jones-Kelley, former Director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services", "*Helen Jones Woods (born 1923), musician"]}]}}
