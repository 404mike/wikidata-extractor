This spanned the leadership of engineering teams, the application of new technology and conducting research into systems engineering.\nStuart\u2019s career started in microwave technology at Roke Manor Research in the UK. His systems engineering knowledge drew heavily on many years of international industrial experience working for Philips in the development, manufacture and product support of domestic, professional and defence systems. He was Software Engineering Manager for Thorn EMI Sensors before moving into government service as Systems Engineering Manager in the UK\u2019s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, later a QinetiQ Fellow and QinetiQ\u2019s Systems Engineering Head of Profession.\nStuart contributed to establishing a common international understanding of the discipline of systems engineering, and to its presentation as a natural and essential element of business practice. As the Editor of the systems engineering International Standards, ISO/IEC 15288 and its companion assessment model ISO/IEC 15504 Part 6, Stuart was at the heart of ISO actions to establish systems engineering as a cardinal component of international trade and commerce. He was also a recognized contributor to both IEEE 1220 and EIA-632.\nStuart was a Chartered Engineer in the UK, a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology, and a Fellow of the International Council of Systems Engineering (INCOSE).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "ISO/IEC 15288", "response": ["The ISO/IEC 15288 is a technical standard in systems engineering which covers processes and lifecycle stages, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Planning for the ISO/IEC 15288:2002(E) standard started in 1994 when the need for a common systems engineering process framework was recognized. The previously accepted standard MIL STD 499A (1974) was cancelled after a memo from the United States Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) prohibited the use of most U.S. Military Standards without a waiver. The first edition was issued on 1 November 2002. Stuart Arnold was the editor and Harold Lawson was the architect of the standard.Systems Engineering \u2013 Guide for ISO/IEC 15288 (System Life Cycle Processes) In 2004 this standard was adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers as IEEE 15288.
