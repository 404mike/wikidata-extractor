With only 7 fragments still extant, he is known largely through short references and the writings of others, notably the Han Feizi and Zhuangzi. A critical reconstruction of the lost book of Shenzi was made by Paul Thompson, and published in 1979 as The Shen Tzu Fragments. In 2007, the Shanghai Museum published a collection of texts written on bamboo slips from the State of Chu dating to the Warring States period, including six bamboo slips with sayings of Shenzi. These are the only known examples of the text of Shenzi that are contemporaneous with its composition."]}, {"page": "Paul Thompson", "response": ["Paul Thompson may refer to:", "*Paul Thompson (professor) (born 1951), British management professor at the University of Strathclyde", "*Paul Thompson (rector) (born 1959), British rector of the Royal College of Art, London, England", "*Paul Thompson (neuroscientist) (born 1971), professor of neurology, University of Southern California", "*Paul Thompson (9/11 researcher), born 20th century, American writer; author of the non-fiction book The Terror Timeline", "*Paul Thompson (oral historian) (born 1935), British sociologist and oral historian", "*Paul Thompson (playwright) (born 1940), Canadian playwright and theatre director", "*Paul Thompson (American football) (born 1983), American quarterback for the University of Oklahoma Sooners", "*Paul Thompson (Australian footballer) (born 1958), Australian footballer for Melbourne", "*Paul Thompson (basketball) (born 1961), American former basketball player", "*Paul Thompson (footballer, born 1973) (born 1973), English former Hartlepool United player", "*Paul Thompson (ice hockey, born 1906) (1906\u20131991), Canadian ice hockey player and coach", "*Paul Thompson (ice hockey, born 1965) (born 1965), British ice hockey player and coach", "*Paul Thompson (ice hockey, born 1988), American ice hockey player", "*Paul Thompson (rower) (born 1964), Australian Olympic rowing coach for Australia and Great Britain", "*Paul Thompson (1907\u20131984), British documentary film-maker, film historian and critic better known as Paul Rotha", "*Paul Thompson (broadcaster), Australian broadcaster", "*Paul Thompson (musician) (born 1951), English drummer for Roxy Music", "*Paul Thompson (sinologist) (1931\u20132007), British sinologist and pioneer in the field of Chinese computer applications", "*Paul Thompson, 1st Baron Wenlock (1784\u20131852), English nobleman and Whig politician", "* Paul Thompson (media executive), New Zealand media executive"]}, {"page": "List of sinologists", "response": ["* Paul Thompson (1931\u20132007)"]}, {"page": "Chefoo School", "response": ["*Paul Thompson (sinologist), Sinologist"]}, {"page": "Hellmut Wilhelm", "response": ["* Paul Thompson (1931 \u2013 2007)\u00a0\u2013 PhD dissertation on Shen Dao."]}, {"page": "Weixian Internment Camp", "response": ["* Paul Thompson, British Sinologist"]}, {"page": "List of School of Oriental and African Studies people", "response": ["*Paul Thompson, Classical Chinese"]}, {"page": "Paul Mulligan Thompson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Thompson (sinologist)"]}, {"page": "Paul Thompson (Sinologist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Thompson (sinologist)"]}]}}
