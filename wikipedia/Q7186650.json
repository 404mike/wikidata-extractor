The absence of any ordained clergy whose ministry the congregation would accept means that little of the once impressive liturgy can still be employed.

The Apostles' Chapel at Albury, Surrey remains in the care of the Catholic Apostolic trustees but stands unused, though maintained. Of the other buildings once operated in Britain, none appears to survive in its original use; the Liverpool church suffered a devastating arson attack when it was on the brink of creative re-use and was then demolished, despite a campaign to save it; a similar building in Manchester has also not survived.

Working on a goatskin binding that had already been attached to a book, she would dampen the leather, trace a design on to the surface, and work the design in relief using a Dresden tool. She became a leading member in a group of Edinburgh women binders (including Jessie MacGibbon, Mrs. Douglas MacLagan, Jean Pagin, and Phoebe Anna Traquair). Her medievalist bindings began to gain attention, and were selected along with others from her Edinburgh group for display in the Victorian Era Exhibition at Earl's Court in 1897. There, they attracted attention of Frank Karslake, a bookseller, who was inspired to host an exhibition of women's bookbindings at his London bookstore. Karslake offered to act as a sales agent for several women binders, including Macdonald, who was excited to have an outlet for her bindings in London. Macdonald was later loosely associated with Karslake's venture, the Guild of Women Binders, until its dissolution in 1904, although she only sold a few of her bindings through it."]}]}}
