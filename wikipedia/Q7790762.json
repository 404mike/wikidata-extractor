He went on to study engraving at the Royal Academy beginning in 1773, during which time he resided at 11 Beaches Row, near Charles Square, Hoxton, and exhibited pastel portraits at the Society of Artists in 1777. He later lived in Orme House in Hampton, Edgefield, Norfolk, and Coltishall, Norfolk.

Only Thomas Holloway's print remains to suggest that critics might have been right in seeing in it more \"burlesque than sublimity\". In the following century, Charles Robert Leslie's 1854 period piece, Sir Plume Demands the Restoration of the Lock, takes place in a cluttered drawing room in which the kind of lap dog present in many previous pictures feeds from a dish on the floor."]}, {"page": "Thomas Holloway", "response": ["Thomas Holloway (22 September 180026 December 1883) was an English patent medicine vendor and philanthropist.", "*Harrison-Barbet, Anthony.
