It included the likes of Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby to add to the already attack minded Peter Ndlovu. The addition of Gary McAllister, following UEFA Euro 1996, should have provided mid-table stability but the team's defensive frailties often undermined Dublin's scoring at the other end. This culminated in possibly one of the greatest escapes in Premier League history in May 1997. Despite having won away to Liverpool (Dublin scoring in the dying seconds) and at home to Chelsea in their previous two games, Coventry City went into the final day second from bottom of the table, needing not only to beat Tottenham Hotspur away from home but also for results elsewhere in the league to go their way for them to escape relegation. Goals from Dublin and Paul Williams gave Coventry a 2\u20131 win at White Hart Lane, while both Middlesbrough and Sunderland lost, and Coventry finished one point outside the relegation zone."]}, {"page": "Martin Allen", "response": ["Allen took over from Wally Downes at Second Division side Brentford in March 2004. He had a good run at the club, saving them from relegation to the Third Division in what remained of the 2003\u201304 season. In the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons he took Brentford to the play-offs with fourth and third-place finishes respectively, but they were eliminated by Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City respectively in the semi-finals on both occasions. Allen won press attention during the 2004\u201305 season for the success of his self-described \"two bob team\", which was composed of ageing pros (John Salako, Andy Myers, Scott Fitzgerald and Jamie Lawrence), free transfers (Deon Burton, Chris Hargreaves, Stewart Talbot and Isaiah Rankin) and young guns who would go on to play in the Premier League (Jay Tabb, Stephen Hunt, Sam Sodje and Michael Turner). Allen took Brentford to the fifth round of the FA Cup in two consecutive years, going out to Premier League sides Southampton in the 2004\u201305 season (losing 3\u20131 in a replay, after a 2\u20132 draw at St Mary's) and Charlton Athletic 3\u20131 in the 2005\u201306 season.

His move to the Midlands club came less than a year after he had scored a hat-trick against them for Leeds. He stayed there for four seasons and played firstly under Ron Atkinson and then former Leeds teammate Gordon Strachan. The side including Noel Whelan, John Salako and Darren Huckerby were in a relegation battle. Atkinson went upstairs to become 'Director of Football' in late 1996 in order to make way for Strachan. Strachan's team continued to struggle until a late season recovery. With McAllister captaining the side, the Sky Blues secured an away draw against Arsenal and wins against Chelsea, Liverpool (away) and Tottenham Hotspur (away) to secure salvation."]}, {"page": "Mark Bright", "response": ["After retiring, Bright became a football correspondent on The Big Breakfast and co-presented The Wright Bright Show with former teammate Ian Wright on BBC Radio 5 Live.

Atkinson made several big-name signings in summer 1995 and during the season, including Brazilian Isa\u00edas, John Salako, Nii Lamptey and Noel Whelan, who arrived for a then-club-record \u00a32 million. They also rejected offers of several million pounds each for Dublin and Ndlovu. After making a reasonable start, the team suffered their worst run in the top flight, playing fourteen league games without a win and by early December City were bottom of the table. They revived somewhat after Whelan's signing in December, but more poor results followed and by Easter, City appeared certain to be relegated. They avoided the drop by winning three of their final six games and benefiting on the final day as Manchester City played out a 2\u20132 draw without attempting to win, under the false belief that this would keep them up. Coventry continued to spend money on players during the summer of 1996, breaking their transfer record again with the purchase of Gary McAllister from Leeds for \u00a33 million. They suffered a poor start to the campaign though, and with Atkinson failing to bring success he was moved to the Director of Football role, handing over to his designated-successor, Strachan. They had a brief revival but as the season drew to a close they were fighting another relegation battle. For the third season in a row Strachan appeared for the team himself, despite being officially retired and inspired the team to a crucial win over Chelsea. They played Tottenham at White Hart Lane in the final game knowing that only a win and favourable results elsewhere would save them. In a match delayed by 15 minutes due to traffic, they held on for a 2\u20131 win and were safe again, their tenth and final last-day escape of the top-flight era."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sevenoaks", "response": ["*John Salako (born 1969) association footballer"]}, {"page": "List of England international footballers born outside England", "response": ["*John Salako"]}, {"page": "List of Crystal Palace F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|John Salako||||MF||1986\u20131995||273||33||||", "*  John Salako \u2013 1987", "*  John Salako \u2013 1988"]}, {"page": "List of footballers in England by number of league appearances", "response": ["!scope=row data-sort-value=\"Salako, John\"|John Salako"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| John Salako ||  Coventry City || 26 March 1998 || 31 May 1998", "| John Salako"]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|  John Salako"]}, {"page": "List of Coventry City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Dion Dublin Nii Lamptey John Salako", "|align=left| John Salako", "|align=left| John Salako"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["| John Salako"]}, {"page": "South London derby", "response": ["* John Salako"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["As a Premier League club, Southampton entered the 1992\u201393 Football League Cup in the Second Round.
