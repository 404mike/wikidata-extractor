It has been carried out using two-level states of a single photon, a single atom and a trapped ion \u2013 among other quantum objects \u2013 and also using two photons. In 1997, two groups experimentally achieved quantum teleportation. The first group, led by Sandu Popescu, was based out Italy. An experimental group led by Anton Zeilinger followed a few months later."]}, {"page": "Timeline of quantum computing and communication", "response": ["* Noah Linden and Sandu Popescu proved that the presence of entanglement is a necessary condition for a large class of quantum protocols.

Some of his main contributions concern the understanding of quantum communication protocols, the coding theory for quantum channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement. Together with Micha\u0142 Horodecki and Jonathan Oppenheim, he discovered quantum state-merging and used this primitive to show that quantum information could be negative. Together with Marcin Pawlowski, Tomasz Paterek, Dagomir Kaszlikowski, and Valerio Scarani, he discovered information causality. Together with Runyao Duan and Simone Severini, he introduced a quantum mechanical version of the Lov\u00e1sz number. Together with Sandu Popescu, Noah Linden and Tony Short he proved that local equilibration of large quantum systems is a generic phenomena."]}, {"page": "Clifford Paterson Lecture", "response": ["* 2004 Sandu Popescu on What is quantum non-locality?"]}, {"page": "John Stewart Bell Prize", "response": ["The John Stewart Bell Prize for Research on Fundamental Issues in Quantum Mechanics and their Applications (short form: \"Bell Prize\") was established in 2009, funded and managed by the University of Toronto, Centre for Quantum Information & Quantum Control (CQIQC).
