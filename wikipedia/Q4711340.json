The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, Boer War to 1902, and then World War I to 1918, provided plentiful commissions.  The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes Toft as one of the major figures of the \"New Sculpture\" following on from William Hamo Thornycroft and George Frampton. Toft described his work as 'Idealist' but he also said of himself that \"to become an idealist you must necessarily first be a realist.\"\nHis father was a notable modeller in ceramics, and his brother was the landscape artist Joseph Alfonso Toft.", "link_mentions": {}}}
