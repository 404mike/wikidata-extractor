The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, Boer War to 1902, and then World War I to 1918, provided plentiful commissions.  The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes Toft as one of the major figures of the \"New Sculpture\" following on from William Hamo Thornycroft and George Frampton. Toft described his work as 'Idealist' but he also said of himself that \"to become an idealist you must necessarily first be a realist.\"\nHis father was a notable modeller in ceramics, and his brother was the landscape artist Joseph Alfonso Toft.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oldham", "response": ["Commissioned in 1919 by the Oldham War Memorial Committee, the memorial was designed and built by Albert Toft.

Albert Toft was a prominent exponent of the New Sculpture, his works exhibiting the movement's characteristic naturalism in form and spiritualism in mood.

One thinks of the work of Albert Toft, Louis Roslyn, and the work of many other British sculptors. What sculptors tried to represent in many of the monument aux morts was the great feeling of loss and grief felt throughout France and thus representations and allegories of weeping women, grieving widows, mothers and children were often seen and many of these are quite beautiful."]}, {"page": "List of public art in Nottingham", "response": ["|Albert Toft"]}, {"page": "Royal Fusiliers War Memorial", "response": ["The  high bronze statue was designed by Albert Toft and cast by A.B.
