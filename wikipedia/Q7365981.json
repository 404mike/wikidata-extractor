The single had no immediate impact upon its release in September 1976, but became a Top 10 single by the end of the year.

Her voice has been likened to Rod Stewart and Kim Carnes as a result of her vocal cord nodule operation in the 1970s, sometimes even being referred to as \"the female Rod Stewart,\" and, after her collaborations with Jim Steinman, \"the female Meat Loaf.\" Soon after her operation, when recording her second album, Natural Force, the studio band complimented Tyler's changed voice.
