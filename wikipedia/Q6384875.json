Just a few months later, however, manager Keith Peacock was controversially sacked, and within 18 months the club had fallen into Division Four.  The ensuing spell in the lower division brought little success, and in the 1992\u201393 Division Three campaign the Gills narrowly avoided relegation to the Football Conference."]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["United's youth team coach John Short also left the club and became a coach at Gillingham, and so Adams then travelled 240\u00a0miles out from home to join Gillingham as an apprentice in August 1978. During his time as an apprentice he won four caps for the England youth team, and competed in a tournament in Yugoslavia. He went on to sign as a professional at Gillingham in November 1979. Due to his natural pace, Adams started his playing career as a left-winger before manager Keith Peacock converted him into a left-back after he was found to lack the technical skill necessary to beat opponents. Coming through the club's ranks at the same time as Steve Bruce, Adams later cited Buster Collins as a major influence upon his career. In 1982\u201383 he was named in the PFA's Third Division Team of the Year."]}, {"page": "Substitute (association football)", "response": ["On 21 August 1965, Keith Peacock of Charlton Athletic became the first substitute used in the Football League when he replaced injured goalkeeper Mike Rose eleven minutes into their away match against Bolton Wanderers. On the same day, Bobby Knox became the first ever substitute to score a goal when he scored for Barrow against Wrexham."]}, {"page": "Alan Curbishley", "response": ["The following season started similarly in that the team reached as high as eighth at the turn of the year, but no wins in the final eight games brought them perilously close to the drop. In the end, though, three draws from the last four games ensured safety in 14th place. Ably assisted by Keith Peacock and Mervyn Day, Alan Curbishley built a sound squad capable of holding its own in the elite league with a good balance of experience and youth, with Chris Bart-Williams, Chris Powell and Graham Stuart alongside up and coming youngsters Scott Parker and Luke Young. It looked as if the team might make a real impact and five successive wins in early 2003 elevated the side to sixth, although defeat by Arsenal started a run of eight defeats in the last 10 games for a 12th-place finish."]}, {"page": "Gavin Peacock", "response": ["Gavin Keith Peacock (born 18 November 1967) is an English former professional footballer and sports television pundit."]}]}}
