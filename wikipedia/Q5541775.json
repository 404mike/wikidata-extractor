He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours.At the 1918 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament for Westbury in Wiltshire, having stood as a Coalition Conservative. Palmer had previously fought the Westbury seat unsuccessfully both at the December 1910 general election and at a by-election in 1911, but in 1918 the strength of the \"coalition coupon\" was enough to wrest the seat by a large margin from the sitting Liberal Party MP Geoffrey Howard.\nThe Liberals retook Westbury at the 1922 election, and Palmer did not stand for Parliament again. He died in 1932 aged 75.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1918 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Lt.-Col. George Llewellen Palmer, late Yeomanry"]}]}}
