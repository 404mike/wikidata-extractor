For thirty years, she taught at Smith College (Northampton, Massachusetts). Duckett published a number of books with University of Michigan Press, mainly on European history, religious history, and saints, and was a reviewer for The New York Times Book Review. Initially, Duckett was known for writing accessible historical books on the Middle Ages; later, she acquired a reputation as an authority on early medieval saints. A devout Episcopalian, Duckett was the lifelong companion of novelist Mary Ellen Chase.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mary Ellen Chase", "response": ["Chase earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Maine in 1909, then both a master's and Ph.D. in English from the University of Minnesota.

A letter by her remains in the Boniface correspondence, in which she writes to Saint Boniface of her grief. The letter evidences that she was highly learned--according to Eleanor Duckett, \"Her letter is short, and her misery is very great; she manages, however, to bring in four reminiscences of Vergil's Aeneid, two of various writings of Aldhelm of Malmesbury ..., two of a letter written by Jerome to the monk Rufinus, together with at least half a dozen quotations from the Bible\". Lina Eckenstein proposes she might have been a daughter of Ealdwulf, king of East Anglia, and the abbess of Repton."]}]}}
