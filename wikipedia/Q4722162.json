This match, which the team won by an innings margin, held for 87 years the record for the lowest total ever scored against a Derbyshire county team. Derbyshire lost the return match. In the 1872 season Derbyshire lost both matches against Lancashire, and achieved the same result in the 1873 season. In the 1874 season Kent joined Lancashire in playing Derbyshire and three wins and a draw made Derbyshire a contender for Champion County. Richardson only played two of the four matches. In the 1875 season, his last as captain Alfort Smith joined the club as a regular wicket-keeper. Richardson played four matches during the 1876 season, but did not play in 1877.
