However, since the early 1990s there have been attempts to revive his reputation. In 1993 Surviving, a collection of previously unpublished works, edited by his grandson Matthew Yorke, was published by Viking Press. Other works have been reissued. Many contemporary authors have cited him as an influence, including John Updike,Charlie Rose  writing, \"His novels made more of a stylistic impact upon me than those of any writer living or dead\" in an introduction to an edition (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics USA, 1993) of three of Green's novels (Living, Loving and Party Going). The novelist Sebastian Faulks, who also wrote an introduction to an edition (Vintage Classics UK, 2005) of these three novels, calls Green \"unique\" and says: \"No fiction has ever thrilled me as the great moments in Living and Loving\". David Lodge calls Green \"an exceptionally gifted and truly original writer\". In his essay The Genesis of Secrecy Frank Kermode discussed Green's novel Party Going and suggested that behind its realistic surface the book hides a complex network of mythical allusions. This led Kermode to include Green in the Modernist movement and to suggest that the novelist was strongly influenced by T.S. Eliot's idea of a \"mythic method\". Green's work has otherwise received comparatively little critical attention from academics; three of the few academics engaged with Green's work are Nick Shepley, author of Henry Green: Class, Style, and the Everyday (Oxford University Press, 2016) Jeremy Treglown, author of Romancing: The Life and Work of Henry Green (Faber and Faber, 2000), and Becci Carver, author of Granular Modernism (Oxford University Press, 2015). New York Review Books has reprinted eight of Green's novels."]}, {"page": "John Llewellyn Rhys Prize", "response": ["|1988 || Matthew Yorke || The March Fence || "]}, {"page": "Emma Tennant", "response": ["Tennant was married four times, including to the journalist and author Christopher Booker between 1963 and 1968 and the political writer Alexander Cockburn between 13 December 1968 and 1973.
