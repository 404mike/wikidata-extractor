Ford in 1958. The name is derived from the fact that Ford described a holdfast consisting only of a double concentric circle, his species being named Charniodiscus concentricus. Later it was discovered that a frond (Charnia masoni) was part of a closely related organism. Charnia differs in the branching structure in the frond."]}, {"page": "Trevor Ford (geologist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Trevor D. Ford"]}, {"page": "Trevor D Ford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Trevor D.
