Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano at an early age and began to compose songs which he recorded on a reel-to-reel tape recorder that she kept in the family drawing-room.", "Drake returned to England in 1967 and moved into his sister's flat in Hampstead, London. That October, he enrolled at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge to study English Literature. His tutors found him bright but unenthusiastic and unwilling to apply himself.Dann (2006), p. 28. His biographer, Trevor Dann, notes that he had difficulty connecting with staff and fellow students, and that matriculation photographs from this time portray a sullen young man. Cambridge placed emphasis on its rugby and cricket teams, but by this time Drake had lost interest in sport, preferring to stay in his college room smoking cannabis and playing music. According to fellow student Brian Wells, \"they were the rugger buggers and we were the cool people smoking dope\".Dann (2006), p. 25", "The experience reinforced Drake's decision to retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.Sandall, Robert. \"Brighter Very Much Later\", The Daily Telegraph, 20 May 2004; retrieved 31 December 2021.

Drake's second album, Bryter Layter (1971),Drake, Gabrielle, Nick Drake: Remembered For A While, Little, Brown and Co., 2014. again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Unterberger, Richie.

Disappointed by his debut's poor sales, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\" Boyd later said. \"I imagined it as more commercial.\"Dann (2006), p. 142. Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \"Northern Sky\" and \"Fly\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \"Northern Sky\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential.Dann (2006), p. 242.

Bannister, from Capital London, favoured a young, racy, news and speech format, miles away from the typically stuffy BBC Local Radio sound.

GLR was aimed at people who hate pop but love music, hate prattle (excessive on-air talk) but want to know what's what where in the world. The station was aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds, who perhaps grew up with Radio 1, but now wanted to be intelligently informed about the city in which they live, and the world in general. Early promotions used the phrase \"rock 'n' rolling news\". Much of the daytime speech output covered London events and nightlife, with comedians and other artists being interviewed.

Previously it had been simulcasting with 94.9\u00a0MHz FM with a few programmes which occasionally opted from FM.

The accompaniment by the classically trained Cale reflects Drake's desire to move away from the pastoral sound of his 1969 debut album Five Leaves Left, which was a commercial failure. Cale's own career was similarly in tatters; he had been fired from the Velvets by Lou Reed two years earlier, and was yet to re-establish his reputation as a formidable producer. Drake sought to broaden his own appeal and tentatively agreed to Boyd's suggestion to include bass and drum tracks on recordings for Bryter Layter, and to experiment with a more pop or jazzy sound, which Boyd admitted he imagined would be \"more commercial\".Dann (2006), p. 142 Yet it essentially retains Drake's original acoustic style, being anchored by long term producers and arrangers Robert Kirby and John Wood's sharp and stripped-down sparse engineering and production values. Trevor Dann believes that the contrasting approach of the two men  produced accompaniment that is \"opulent without overpowering the fragile little song\".Dann,  p. 242", "Boyd was at the time working as co-producer with John Cale on Nico's Desertshore album. Boyd sent the recently ex-Velvet Underground member a demo recording of a few of the tracks that were to form Bryter Layter.Dann,  p. 143 The morning Cale received them, he rang Boyd asking \"Who the fuck *is* this guy? I have to meet him, where is he right now.\" He described his first impressions after meeting Drake as of \"a very quiet guy. It was very difficult to figure what was going on in his mind. He made music with a real sensuality \u2013 very different from English folk music\".Dann,  p. 144 Boyd phoned Drake, and was given consent  \u2013 Boyd claims Drake's only words during the conversation were \"Oh, uh, OK\". He arranged a recording session for the following day, on the condition that Cale would be allowed to add accompaniment to the tracks. That morning, with Wood and Kirby engineering and assisting, they recorded \"Northern Sky\" and \"Fly\". Cale improvised piano, celeste, and Hammond organ parts on \"Northern Sky\", and viola and harpsichord arrangements on \"Fly\". In his 2006 biography of Drake, Trevor Dann describes Cale's contribution as infusing the tracks with a \"subtlety that Robert Kirby's full-blown arrangements didn't quite match on some of the other tracks [on Bryter Layter]."]}, {"page": "Sounds of the 20th Century", "response": ["The series was produced by Trevor Dann's Company, and there is a series blog available at sottc.wordpress.com."]}, {"page": "Plymouth Gold", "response": ["* Trevor Dann"]}, {"page": "Classic Gold 1332", "response": ["* Trevor Dann"]}, {"page": "Classic Gold Digital Network", "response": ["* Classic Gold Albums with Trevor Dann", "* Trevor Dann"]}, {"page": "25 Years of Rock", "response": ["The series was produced by Trevor Dann.
