He conducted experiments and researched thermodynamics, producing and publishing reliable tables on the thermodynamic properties of steam used for calculations. Callendar worked with multiple institutions during World War I, helping to research and develop useful tools for the Navy.Callendar received awards such as the James Watt Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers (1898) and the Rumford Medal (1906). He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, and later a member of the Physical Society of London. Callendar was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physics three times.He died at home in Ealing, after an operation in 1930.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Rutherford", "response": ["In 1898, Thomson recommended Rutherford for a position at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

In 1930 he was appointed Professor at Imperial College London in the chair of the late Hugh Longbourne Callendar. In the late 1930s and during the Second World War Thomson specialised in nuclear physics, concentrating on practical military applications. In particular Thomson was the chairman of the crucial MAUD Committee in 1940\u20131941 that concluded that an atomic bomb was feasible. In later life he continued this work on nuclear energy but also wrote works on aerodynamics and the value of science in society."]}, {"page": "Resistance thermometer", "response": ["In 1871 Werner von Siemens invented the Platinum Resistance Temperature Detector and presented a three-term interpolation formula.
