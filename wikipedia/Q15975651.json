Starring Dougray Scott, Kara Tointon and Iddo Goldberg, this film follows the man; a doctor and a widower, and their commuters' efforts to stop the train after it was discovered to have been hijacked by an unknown, mysterious driver.", "In an interview about the film in the March 2013 issue of V\u00e9rit\u00e9 Magazine, Omid Nooshin said \"There's a mythic resonance, being trapped in the Belly of the Whale, but there's also an existential dimension, hurtling towards the end of the line, towards certain death. I'm drawn to the work of anthropologist Ernest Becker who posited that mortality buffering actions constituted a kind of science of human behaviour.\"", "After receiving development backing from the UK Film Council, the script was voted onto the 2008 Brit List, an industry compiled ranking of the best unproduced screenplays in the UK. However, taking the film into production required a \"heroic effort\" according to executive producer Kwesi Dickson. Consequently, Nooshin directed and co-produced along with producers Zack Winfield, Ado Yoshizaki and Dickson a \u00a3500 trailer to attract potential backers, filming on a heritage train on loan from the Bluebell Railway in Sussex. Todd Brown, founder of Twitch.com, wrote in March 2011 \"Omid Nooshin's Last Passenger does not yet exist but it will soon. At least it will if the microbudget promo he shot for the film has anything to say about it,\" The trailer was instrumental in attracting the backing of Path\u00e9, the British Film Institute and Pinewood Studios. Last Passenger went on to strong pre-sales at the 2011 Cannes Film Market, the business counterpart of the Cannes Film Festival.", "Gary Goldstein wrote in the LA Times that taken on its own lower budget terms Last Passenger is an \"engrossing, pulse-quickening journey that deserves a wider local release than it's receiving.\" and added that it is \"Impressively directed by Omid Nooshin\". Total Film gave the film 3/5 stars, describing it as having \"consistently tense, explosive action\" The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"Last Passenger is a superbly executed B-movie that puts most bigger-budgeted Hollywood efforts to shame.\" Indiewire also wrote positively about the film saying \"'Last Passenger' is a good antithesis to the overloaded and cluttered action Hollywood seems to love nowadays. If you're not feeling especially picky on plot or character, you won't go wrong with this compelling and stylish train thriller.\"", "|The Douglas Hickox Award (Debut Director)(Omid Nooshin)"]}, {"page": "British Independent Film Awards 2013", "response": ["* Omid Nooshin \u2013 Last Passenger"]}, {"page": "Kill Switch (2017 film)", "response": ["Kill Switch (also known as Redivider) is an 2017 American-Dutch science fiction film, directed by Tim Smit in his directorial debut, from a screenplay by Charlie Kindinger and Omid Nooshin.
