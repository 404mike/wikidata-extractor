Their official report into the disaster condemned the defences at Scapa Flow, and censured Sir Wilfred French, Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands, for their unprepared state. French was placed on the retired list, despite having warned the previous year of Scapa Flow's deficient anti-submarine defences, and volunteering to bring a small ship or submarine himself past the blockships to prove his point. On Churchill's orders, the eastern approaches to Scapa Flow were sealed with concrete causeways linking Lamb Holm, Glimps Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay to Mainland. Constructed largely by Italian prisoners of war, the Churchill Barriers, as they became known, were essentially complete by September 1944, and were opened officially just after VE Day in May 1945."]}, {"page": "Robert Raikes (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Raikes (1736\u20131811) was an English pioneer of Sunday schools, Gloucester newspaper publisher, and philanthropist.", "Robert Raikes may also refer to:", "* Robert Raikes (1683\u20131753), British Member of Parliament for Northallerton", "* Robert Raikes the Elder (1690\u20131757), English printer and newspaper publisher", "* Robert Raikes (1765\u20131837), British banker and builder of a notable mausoleum", "* Robert Raikes (1818\u20131901), established a tractarian church at Treberfydd", "* Robert Raikes (Royal Navy officer) (1885\u20131953), British admiral", "Robert Raikes' House, a 16th-century timber-framed town house in Gloucester"]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic", "response": ["*Vice Admiral Sir Robert Raikes (1940\u20131941)S.
