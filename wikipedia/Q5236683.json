He was highly successful in the British Rally Championship, winning the title twice in 1989 and 1990, both times at the wheel of a Toyota Celica GT-Four. In the European Rally Championship for drivers, he finished third in 1987, while his highest placing in the World Rally Championship was 36th in 1987.\n\nLlewellin was born in Haverfordwest. In the course of his career, Llewellin drove for a number of different teams reaching a pinnacle during his time with the Toyota team.\nLlewellin's son, Ben Llewellin, is a sports shooter who won a silver medal for Wales in the skeet event at the 2018 Commonwealth Games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*David Llewellin (born 1960), rally driver"]}, {"page": "Vauxhall Motors", "response": ["During 1991\u201392 serious consideration was given to campaigning the four-wheel-drive version of the Vauxhall Calibra in British and possibly world rallies, and a trial version contested the 1993 Swedish Rally in the hands of Stig Blomqvist.

The latest version of the Astra was an ideal contender, and won the category in the 1993 and 1994 championships, driven by David Llewellin.
