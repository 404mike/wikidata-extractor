Turner-Hall was known as 'The Bull' in his football playing days, and it is his hefty frame that can at times make him one of the most brutal attacking forces in the Premiership today. Honours such as representing Harlequins 1st XV at 17 years old, and playing for the England under 20s on a regular basis, have already come before him.\nHe started for Harlequins in their 2011\u201312 Premiership final victory over Leicester Tigers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harlequin F.C.", "response": ["|Academy Coach||  Jordan Turner-Hall"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Brighton College", "response": ["*Jordan Turner-Hall (born 1988), England and Harlequins rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Jordan (name)", "response": ["*Jordan Turner-Hall (born 1988), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2009 June rugby union tests", "response": ["|IC ||12||Jordan Turner-Hall"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1338||Jordan Turner-Hall||(centre)||2012-02-04||v Scotland at Murrayfield"]}, {"page": "2011 June rugby union tests", "response": ["|CE ||22||Jordan Turner-Hall || || "]}, {"page": "2012 Six Nations Championship", "response": ["|CE ||21||Jordan Turner-Hall || || ", "*Brad Barritt, Lee Dickson, Phil Dowson, Owen Farrell, Ben Morgan, Geoff Parling, Jordan Turner-Hall (all England) and Lee Jones (Scotland) made their international debuts.", "|CE ||21||Jordan Turner-Hall || || "]}, {"page": "2011 Churchill Cup", "response": ["|CE ||21||Jordan Turner-Hall || || "]}, {"page": "Hove Rugby Club", "response": ["*Jordan Turner-Hall England U20, Harlequins Rugby"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Premiership Rugby", "response": ["|IC ||12|| Jordan Turner-Hall", "|IC ||12|| Jordan Turner-Hall"]}, {"page": "2012 June rugby union tests", "response": ["|IC ||12||Jordan Turner-Hall", "|IC ||12||Jordan Turner-Hall"]}, {"page": "2012 England rugby union tour of South Africa", "response": ["Backs: Anthony Allen (Leicester Tigers), Chris Ashton (Northampton Saints), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Mike Brown (Harlequins), Danny Care (Harlequins), Lee Dickson (Northampton Saints), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Toby Flood (Leicester Tigers), Ben Foden (Northampton Saints), Alex Goode (Saracens), Charlie Hodgson (Saracens), Jonathan Joseph (London Irish), George Lowe (Harlequins), Ugo Monye (Harlequins), David Strettle (Saracens), Manu Tuilagi (Leicester Tigers), Jordan Turner-Hall (Harlequins), Christian Wade (London Wasps), Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers)"]}, {"page": "Tom Casson", "response": ["Casson made his competitive debut for Quins with a start against Bayonne in the Amlin Cup on 10 August 2010.
