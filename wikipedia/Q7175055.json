He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and played for Middlesex and Glamorgan. In a career spanning 14 years, he appeared in 68 first-class matches. He is notable in cricket history for having recorded the fastest pair ever, at Cardiff Arms Park against the visiting Indians in 1946. He was dismissed by two consecutive balls within the space of a minute, when his captain decided to reverse the batting order, having been forced to follow on.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Middlesex County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Peter Judge (1933\u20131934) : P.

This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but had some problems with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.Playfair, pp. 97\u201398."]}, {"page": "Pairs in Test and first-class cricket", "response": ["When Glamorgan followed on against the Indians at Cardiff Arms Park in June 1946, last man Peter Judge was bowled for a duck by Chandra Sarwate to end the county's first innings. Invited to follow-on, Glamorgan's captain Johnny Clay, who was the non-striker, decided to waive the 10-minute interval between innings, remained in the middle with Judge, and reversed the entire batting order. Sarwate then bowled Judge again, second ball, incidentally with the same ball, and Judge thus achieved the fastest pair in the history of first-class cricket.The coach who caught Sachin, and a much-travelled man, Cricinfo, Retrieved on 20 February 2009John Arlott: Basingstoke Boy  1992 Fontana"]}, {"page": "Judge (surname)", "response": ["*Peter Judge (cricketer) (1916\u20131992), British cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Peter Judge (1939\u20131947) : P.
