He had a long association with film directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, beginning in 1943 when he was floor manager on The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp. Three years later, when Powell and Pressburger, also known as The Archers, made A Matter of Life and Death, Lawson had graduated to assistant art director. He worked with Alfred Junge on the sets for Black Narcissus in 1947, and earned an Oscar for the set designs on The Red Shoes in 1948. Lawson's association with Powell continued right through to Peeping Tom (1960). He received a BAFTA nomination for The Bedford Incident in 1965.\nListing of films:\n1942       The Foreman Went to France\n1943       The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\n1944       This Happy Breed\n1944       The Way Ahead\n1945       They Knew Mr. Knight\n1946       A Matter of Life and Death\n1947       Black Narcissus\n1948       The Red Shoes\n1950       Gone to Earth\n1950       The Elusive Pimpernel\n1951       The Tales of Hoffmann\n1952       Folly to Be Wise\n1952       The Story of Robin Hood and His Merry Men\n1953       Twice upon a Time\n1953       Front Page Story\n1954       The Constant Husband\n1955       Oh...
