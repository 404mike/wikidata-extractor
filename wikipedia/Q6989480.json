A right-back, he made 112 league appearances in a nine-year career in the Football League, turning out for Blackburn Rovers, Port Vale, and Crewe Alexandra. He won the Third Division title with Rovers in 1974\u201375.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dennis Butler", "response": ["Following his retirement as a player, he coached at Rochdale and Bury. He was made assistant manager at Port Vale under Bobby Smith in November 1977. After Smith's departure to Swindon Town, he became manager for the 1978\u201379 season. The \"Valiants\" finished 16th in the Fourth Division and later he left by mutual consent in August 1979. He had signed popular player Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000, however most of his big money signings had torrid times at Vale Park. He signed right-back Neil Wilkinson (free), Ken Todd (a club-record \u00a337,000 signing despite only having made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers), Gerry Keenan (\u00a315,000), Felix Healy (\u00a38,000), Kevin Tully (\u00a33,000 plus Neil Wilkinson), Andy Proudlove (\u00a31,000), Peter Farrell (breaking the club-record again at \u00a340,000), and Bob Delgado (\u00a330,000). To finance these signings, he sold John Froggatt (\u00a38,000), Mick Moore (\u00a32,000), Terry Bailey (\u00a32,000), Ken Beamish (\u00a335,000), and John Ridley (\u00a355,000). After his team were booed he called the fans 'a bunch of yobs'. Vale recorded a \u00a352,000 loss despite a remarkable \u00a3225,000 income from the club's commercial department. Butler's transfer dealings had lost the club \u00a336,000, whilst wages more than doubled from \u00a3113,000 to \u00a3259,000. After leaving Burslem, Butler then reunited with Bobby Smith at Swindon, becoming the first team coach before retiring from football in 1980."]}, {"page": "Kevin Tully", "response": ["Tully joined Crewe Alexandra for the 1975\u201376 campaign, as the \"Railwaymen\" finished just three points above the Football League's re-election zone. Crewe rose to 12th in 1976\u201377 and then 15th in 1977\u201378 under the stewardship of Harry Gregg. He left Gresty Road soon after Warwick Rimmer was appointed manager, and joined Dennis Butler's Port Vale in exchange for Neil Wilkinson and \u00a33,000 in October 1978. He featured nine times in 1978\u201379, scoring once in a 3\u20130 win over Halifax Town on 14 October. He played just seven games for the \"Valiants\" in 1979\u201380, before having his contract cancelled at Vale Park \"by mutual consent\" by new boss John McGrath in February 1980. He moved into Cheshire County League football with Chorley, before returning to the Fourth Division with Jim Iley's Bury in 1980\u201381. He played ten games for the \"Shakers\" before leaving Gigg Lane and returning to the non-league scene with Barrow (Alliance Premier League) and Witton Albion (Northern Premier League)."]}, {"page": "Neil Wilkinson", "response": ["Neil Wilkinson may refer to:", "* Neil Wilkinson (ice hockey) (born 1967), Canadian ice hockey player", "* Neil Wilkinson (footballer) (1955\u20132016), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw new manager Dennis Butler sign big striker Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000 and right-back Neil Wilkinson on a free transfer from Blackburn Rovers. Butler also took the team on a three match tour of Scotland. Just before the start of the season Ken Todd was signed for a club-record \u00a337,000, despite Todd having only made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers. In the summer former Valiant Tommy McLaren committed suicide, friend and teammate Ray Williams said 'leaving the club shattered him'. On 2 October a Memorial Fund match was played, raising \u00a33,000.", "The season opened with just two victories in eleven league games, as both Todd and keeper John Connaughton were sidelined with injuries. The two wins came away from home, 5\u20131 over rivals Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road (Wright scoring a hat-trick) and 3\u20131 at Doncaster Rovers at the Keepmoat Stadium. Butler then threw himself into the transfer market, selling John Froggatt to Northampton Town for \u00a38,000, and then Mick Moore and Terry Bailey to Wigan Athletic and Northwich Victoria respectively, both for \u00a32,000. Another 'shrewd piece of business' came when star forward Ken Beamish was sold to Bury for \u00a335,000, whilst Gerry Keenan moved the other way for \u00a315,000. In October, Felix Healy was signed from Finn Harps for \u00a38,000, and Neil Wilkinson and \u00a33,000 were traded to Crewe in exchange for outside-right Kevin Tully. Winning five games in a sequence of eight, Todd was still a disappointment to fans, who began getting 'on his back'. Butler's signings did not stop however, and instead he sold John Ridley to Leicester City for a club-record \u00a355,000. He then signed Andy Proudlove from Buxton for \u00a31,000 \u2013 despite interest from Stafford Rangers. Then in came midfielder Peter Farrell from Bury for a new club-record \u00a340,000.
