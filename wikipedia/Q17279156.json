He was the first to propose the idea of an ordering process in this context. The charge ordered structure of magnetite was solved in 2011 by a group led by Paul Attfield with the results published in Nature. Periodic lattice distortions associated with charge order were later mapped in the manganite lattice to reveal striped domains containing topological disorder."]}, {"page": "John Loveday (physicist)", "response": ["In 2004 he helped establish the Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions, where he works with Andrew D.
