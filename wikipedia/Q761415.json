Many of these relate to the superior adaptation to cold environments possessed by the Neanderthal populations. Their surface to volume ratio is an extreme version of that found amongst Inuit populations, indicating that they were less inclined to lose body heat than were AMH. From brain Endocasts, Neanderthals also had significantly larger brains. This would seem to indicate that the intellectual superiority of AMH populations may be questionable. More recent research by Eiluned Pearce, Chris Stringer, R.I.M. Dunbar, however, have shown important differences in brain architecture. For example, in both the orbital chamber size and in the size of the occipital lobe, the larger size suggests that the Neanderthal had a better visual acuity than modern humans. This would give a superior vision in the inferior light conditions found in Glacial Europe. It also seems that the higher body mass of Neanderthals had a correspondingly larger brain mass required for body care and control."]}, {"page": "Early modern human", "response": ["In this more narrow definition of H. sapiens, the subspecies Homo sapiens idaltu, discovered in 2003, also falls under the umbrella of \"anatomically modern\". The recognition of H. sapiens idaltu as a valid subspecies of the anatomically modern human lineage would justify the description of contemporary humans with the subspecies name Homo sapiens sapiens. However, biological anthropologist Chris Stringer does not consider idaltu distinct enough within H. sapiens to warrant its own subspecies designation."]}, {"page": "Homo heidelbergensis", "response": ["Though H. erectus is still maintained as a highly variable, widespread and long-lasting species, it is still much debated whether or not sinking all Middle Pleistocene remains into it is justifiable. Mayr's lumping of H. heidelbergensis was first opposed by American anthropologist Francis Clark Howell in 1960. In 1974, British physical anthropologist Chris Stringer pointed out similarities between the Kabwe 1 and the Greek Petralona skulls to the skulls of modern humans (H. sapiens or H. s. sapiens) and Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis or H. s. neanderthalensis). So, Stringer assigned them to Homo sapiens sensu lato (\"in the broad sense\"), as ancestral to modern humans and Neanderthals. In 1979, Stringer and Finnish anthropologist Bj\u00f6rn Kurt\u00e9n found that the Kabwe and Petralona skulls are associated with the Cromerian industry like the Mauer mandible, and thus postulated these three populations might be allied with each other. Though these fossils are poorly preserved and do not provide many comparable possible diagnostic traits (and likewise it was difficult at the time to properly define a unique species), they argued that at least these Middle Pleistocene specimens should be allocated to H. (s.?) heidelbergensis or \"H. (s.?) rhodesiensis\" (depending on, respectively, the inclusion or exclusion of the Mauer mandible) to formally recognise their similarity."]}, {"page": "Herto Man", "response": ["In another simultaneously published paper, British physical anthropologist Chris Stringer doubted the validity of \"H. s. idaltu\", saying the material was similar to some Late Pleistocene Australasian specimens. White et al. made note of this, but still considered Herto Man \"clearly distinct\". In 2011, American anthropologists Kyle Lubsen and Robert Corruccini compared BOU-VP-16/1 with Skhul 5 from Es-Skhul Cave, Israel (temporally close to the Qafzeh materal), and instead reported these two skulls are closely allied with each other. That is, their analysis found no support for Herto Man's position as a transitional morph, nor the nomen idaltu. In 2014, anthropologists Robert McCarthy and Lynn Lucas considered a much larger sample than White et al.\u2014using several specimens representing \"archaic Homo\", Neanderthal, \"early modern H. s. sapiens\", and Late Pleistocene H. s. sapiens\u2014and arrived at the same conclusion as Lubsen and Corruccini. Citing these two studies, in 2016, Stringer, in his review of literature regarding the derivation of H. s. sapiens, said the name idaltu, \"does not seem justified.\" The main issue of palaeosubspecies validity lies in the vague definitions of \"species\" and \"subspecies\", especially when discussing a chronospecies (an unbroken lineage which gradually changes, making the exact end-morphology and start-morphology of the ancestor and descendant species unresolvable). The original describers in 2019 still upheld the name \"H. s. idaltu\" because their argument, \"depended largely on discrete traits,\" whereas Mcarthy and Lucas, \"focused only on the gross cranial metrics\", but also stated debating the exact taxonomic names and labels is overall not as important as understanding trends in human evolution."]}, {"page": "Paleoanthropology", "response": ["* Chris Stringer (1947\u2013)"]}, {"page": "Lake Makgadikgadi", "response": ["The conclusion is  disputed by Chris Stringer, head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London, and Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania."]}, {"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["*Homo Britannicus by Chris Stringer"]}, {"page": "Hoxne", "response": ["In 1797, John Frere (1740-1807) found flint hand tools twelve feet deep in Hoxne Brick Pit, and he was the first person to recognise ancient tools as being man-made. One of his hand axes is in the British Museum. His letter to the Society of Antiquaries, read on 22 June 1797 and published in the Society's journal Archaeologia in 1800, argued for the antiquity of these handaxes as \"even beyond the present world,\" in a period now recognised as belonging to the Lower Paleolithic Age.  Frere argued that these \"weapons\" were coincident with nearby extinct elephant fossils, in strata at the site of what is now known to be a Middle Pleistocene lake formed during the Great Interglacial geological warming period in Europe.  Accordingly, in Britain that entire period is called \"Hoxnian,\" signifying its identification there, based on evidence from undisturbed layers of pollens from plants and trees found at Frere's site in the 1950s (notably by Richard Gilbert West), which established the cycle of warming and cooling and defined the stages of the Great Interglacial.Chris Stringer, Homo Britannicus: The Incredible Story of Human Life in Britain (London: 2006) Teams headed by the University of Chicago made extensive excavations at Frere's site for five years between 1971 and 1978.Ronald Singer et al., The Lower Paleolithic Site at Hoxne, England (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993). They confirmed the date of the handaxes as ca 400,000 years BP, coincident with the Swanscombe finds, which, unlike the Hoxne, include human remains.  Subsequent research by the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain team has confirmed the presence of these ancestors of the Neanderthals as occurring towards the terminal, cooling phase of the Interglacial period, which, according to Chris Stringer, \"came to an end,...taking with it the lush river valleys, forests and grasslands on which the herds of horses and deer, and their hunters, relied.  Ice sheets returned...to the north-west of Europe...and a new pattern of episodic occupation was set in motion,\" lasting over three hundred thousand years.Stringer, Homo Britannicus, pp. 90f.

A second technique, using 3D microscopy, showed that the flesh had been removed from the bones using the same tools and techniques used on animal bones. According to Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, this supports theories about cannibalism amongst the people living in or visiting the cave at that time. In February 2011, the same team published an analysis of human skulls of the same date found at the cave around 1987, which they believe were deliberately fashioned into ritual drinking cups or bowls.", "In 2020 a twenty centimetre long forty thousand year old mammoth tusk with a line of four holes drilled into it was interpreted as being a device for making rope. Grooves around each hole would have held plant fibres in place. The instrument was found near the base of the Aurignacian deposits at Hohle Fels by a team led by Nicholas Conard of the institute of archaeological sciences at the University of T\u00fcbingen. Veerle Rots, of the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium was able to make four twisted strands of twine, using a bronze replica of the Hohle Fels cave device, an example of Experimental archaeology. A similar 15,000 years old device, made of reindeer antler, was found in Gough's Cave. The existence of these tools at different locations indicates rope-making had already become an important human activity by the Upper Paleolithic. Chris Stringer Research Leader in Human Origins at the Natural History Museum said, \"These devices were called batons and were originally thought to have been carried by chiefs as badges of rank. However, they had holes with spirals round them and we now realise they must have been used to make or manipulate ropes.\" The ropes could then have been used to construct fishing nets, snares and traps, bows and arrows, clothing and containers for carrying food. Heavy objects, such as sleds, could now be hauled on ropes while spear points could be lashed to poles."]}]}}
