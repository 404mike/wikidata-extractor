Although he was given a wage of 10 shillings per week, he continued to work locally as a labourer. He described his two streams of income as making him \"feel like a millionaire\". The Cardiff squad was undergoing a significant overhaul under the management team of secretary-manager Fred Stewart and trainer George Latham; all but four of the senior team players they had inherited from previous manager Davy McDougall were released. The pair were impressed by Keenor's performances and handed him first-team opportunities at the end of the 1912\u201313 season. Keenor featured in two friendly matches, a 9\u20130 victory over Bridgend YMCA, in which he scored, and a 1\u20131 draw with Mid Rhondda. The presence of Billy Hardy, Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey, who became known as the \"holy three\" by fans, restricted his first-team opportunities as the trio ensured the club won promotion to the First Division of the Southern Football League after conceding just 15 goals during the campaign. Keenor was forced to wait until 6 December 1913 to make his competitive debut for the club, playing in a 1\u20131 draw with Exeter City in the First Division. He endured a difficult start and was described in a local newspaper report as \"the weak link in a very strong side\". He made just two further appearances for the side during the remainder of the 1913\u201314 season. He featured in a 2\u20131 victory over Plymouth Argyle and a 0\u20130 draw with Millwall.", "After returning to Wales, Keenor hoped to resume his playing career immediately, but the Southern Football League had set no official date for its return. To support his family during the hiatus, he worked as a milkman and in a local gas works. When the Football Association resumed fixtures in 1919 following the end of hostilities, he rejoined Cardiff City, despite being told by army doctors that his shrapnel wound meant he would never play football again. He resumed playing in the Southern Football League for the club, playing his first competitive match in August 1919. Having mostly been a member of the reserve team before the outbreak of the war, Keenor returned to Cardiff as an experienced member of the squad having played for his battalion and Brentford during wartime. He featured in two of the club's three pre-season fixtures. Fred Stewart resumed his role of secretary-manager following the war. He was given a selection issue in the form of Keenor and the presence of his regular first choice Patrick Cassidy. However, Cassidy pushed for Keenor to be given the chance to play due to his \"youth and promise\". After this, Keenor featured regularly for the first team. Cardiff's squad had escaped the war relatively intact with most of the side returning to play. They went on to win the 1920 Welsh Cup, defeating Wrexham 2\u20131 in the final.

Hardy missed only one league match during the campaign and scored his first senior goal for the club in a 1\u20131 draw with Pontypridd on 24 March 1913. The success was built around Hardy and Stewart's new signings, Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey, who formed a partnership with Hardy that became known by fans as the \"holy three\". The side conceded only 15 goals en route to the Second Division title, and suffered  a single defeat. The following year, Hardy recorded his first ever present season for the club; he played in all 38 matches as Cardiff finished 10th in the First Division and helped the side to their second Welsh Cup title in the penultimate season before the outbreak of World War I. During the war, Hardy served on the front lines and was wounded in action."]}, {"page": "Fred Stewart (football manager)", "response": ["In his first season, the club kept pace with the league leaders but lost form during February and finished the campaign in third place, seven points behind promoted sides Merthyr Town and Portsmouth. He did however lead the club to its first Welsh Cup victory by defeating Pontypridd 3\u20130 in a replay of the final to become the first team from the south of Wales to win the competition. In his second year, he began to improve the club's fortunes as they were promoted into the First Division of the Southern Football League. Stewart made several signings before the start of the campaign, reshaping the club's defence with the signings of goalkeeper Herbert Kneeshaw and defenders Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey. Stewart led the side to the Second Division title, having lost only one of their 24 games with his newly formed defence proving instrumental to their success, conceding only 15 goals during the campaign. Following their success, the Athletic News wrote that the club could \"trace their success to May 1911, when they appointed Mr. Fred Stewart ... as secretary and team manager.\""]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Patrick Cassidy||||1911\u20131912||4||0||"]}, {"page": "List of Cardiff City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["No player has finished his Cardiff career on 99 appearances, Patrick Cassidy and Tom Sloan both reached 98 appearances before leaving the club.

Two players, Davy McDougall and Richie Morgan, went on to manage the team. McDougall was appointed as the club's first manager in 1910 and remained in the role until the following year. Morgan managed the side between 1978 and 1981 before moving into another role at the club. Despite only appearing in 25 matches for Cardiff, Robin Friday is regarded as one of the most notable cult heroes in the club's history due to his performances and his personality.

The club placed an advert in the Athletic News and eventually appointed Fred Stewart, who had experience of managing in the Football League with Stockport County. Stewart was appointed on a three-year contract earning \u00a34 a week, the maximum wage a player could earn at the time. He began a complete overhaul of the playing squad, retaining only four of the players he inherited from McDougall (Evans, Bob Lawrie, Ted Husbands and Tom Abley), and began recruiting mainly from Scotland and the North-west of England. His first signing at the club was Billy Hardy, with Stewart paying the \u00a325 transfer fee himself. Hardy and fellow new arrivals Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey formed a defensive partnership that led to the trio being dubbed the \"holy three\" by fans. After leading the team to victory in the Welsh Cup in his first season, becoming the first team from the South of Wales to win the trophy, he guided the team to promotion after winning the Southern Football League Second Division in the 1912\u201313 season, losing only one match during the campaign. Cardiff remained in the First Division for two further seasons, finishing third during the 1914\u201315 season, before competitive football was suspended following the outbreak of World War I. At the start of the conflict, the club's entire playing squad volunteered for home defence duty and Ninian Park was used for drilling practice. Nine players on the club's books eventually enlisted in the forces, the most notable being Fred Keenor and backup goalkeeper John Stephenson. Reserve player Tom Witts was the only contracted Cardiff player killed during the conflict. On the cessation of hostilities, Cardiff spent one final season in the Southern League, finishing fourth in the First Division, and won the Welsh Cup for the second time."]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Stewart also allowed defenders Patrick Cassidy and Kidder Harvey to leave the club, surprising many fans and local journalists given the two players' experience.
