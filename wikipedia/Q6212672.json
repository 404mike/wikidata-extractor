Born in 1952, he started off as a Scottish League official in the early 1980s before moving to Newcastle in England in his work as a bank manager. After one season as a linesman (1986\u201387) he was promoted to the middle and refereed for the next two seasons in the English Football League. He then moved back to Scotland (Kilwinning), and back to the Scottish referees list. Indeed, he made the Scottish FIFA panel of referees before leaving the list in the late 1990s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Baines", "response": ["Baines remained in Chesterfield and worked in insurance. In a rare move for an ex-player he soon took up refereeing. He made good progress, reaching the Panel Leagues and becoming a Football League assistant in 1994. After just one year he was promoted to the Referees List. Only one other referee had ever been promoted that quickly \u2013 former Scottish League referee Joe Timmons, in 1987. Only two other referees \u2013 Bob Matthewson and John Lloyd \u2013 had previous professional playing experience but the pair only made five League appearances between them."]}, {"page": "Timmons", "response": ["* Joe Timmons (born 1952), Scottish football referee"]}]}}
