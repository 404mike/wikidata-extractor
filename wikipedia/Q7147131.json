He was elected as an anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) to the 3rd D\u00e1il at the 1922 general election for the Monaghan constituency but did not take his seat because of the absentionist policy of Sinn F\u00e9in. He was re-elected at the 1923 general election and once again did not take his seat. He was elected as a Fianna F\u00e1il TD at the June 1927 general election and took his seat on 12 August 1927 along with the other Fianna F\u00e1il TDs. He did not contest the September 1927 general election.\nMacCarvill studied at University College Dublin (UCD) and was a medical doctor, as was his son. Prior to being fully qualified MacCarvill helped in training of members of Cumann na mBan after the 1916 Easter Rising and during the Irish War of Independence in first aid in Harcourt Street, along with Dr Kathleen Lynn and Dr Geraghty. During his time in UCD he played Gaelic football winning the Sigerson Cup medals in 1917 and 1918. He also played soccer which caused him difficulties with the GAA in the College.\nHis selection as candidate for the 1922 general election was controversial since the anti-Treaty side selected MacCarvill instead of Se\u00e1n MacEntee. The pro-Treaty side claimed this breached the electoral pact which would have resulted in two pro-Treaty and one anti-Treaty candidates being elected without a contest. As a result of the selection of MacCarvill, the pro-Treaty side stood an independent candidate Thomas McHugh which forced an election. MacCarvill duly was elected. MacCarvill unsuccessfully stood at the 1948 general election in Monaghan for Clann na Poblachta.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Conn Ward", "response": ["That same year he earned controversy for the government. He owned a bacon factory business in Monaghan. After the manager was dismissed, the manager's brother Patrick McCarvill, a former Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Monaghan, and a close friend of de Valera, sent a list of allegations about Ward to the Taoiseach \u00c9amon de Valera. He set up an inquiry and the Tribunal reported a month later. Ward was cleared of all charges except tax evasion on payments he received from the business. De Valera insisted he resign and he did so a week later. He did not seek re-election at the 1948 general election and retired from politics. He resumed his medical practice and died in 1966."]}, {"page": "Public inquiries in the Republic of Ireland", "response": ["| Ward Tribunal || Allegations by Patrick McCarvill against Conn Ward, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health || John O'Byrne, Kevin Haugh, William G.
