Tom Johnston had retired, due to old age and losing the respect of the playing faithful. Buxton set about revitalising the club, he demanded respect from the players and brought in harder training sessions which were taken by himself and John Haselden who had been promoted to Assistant Manager as well as taking over Physio duties. He signed Ian Robins, Peter Fletcher and off-loaded players such as Kevin Johnson, Terry Gray and Bobby Campbell. The 1979\u201380 season proved to be the start of the revolution under Buxton where Town won the 4th Division Championship and scored 101 goals in the process. Buxton also won the Bell's Manager of the Year award for the Fourth Division. The following season Buxton set the club's then-record transfer fee of \u00a3110,000 for Terry Austin, but it was his first signing, Ian Robins, together with earlier acquisitions, Steve Kindon and Brian Stanton, who set the club alight, scoring a combined total of 41 goals as Town finished just outside the promotion places.", "However, an injury-ravaged 1981\u201382 season brought about the premature retirements of Steve Kindon, Fred Robinson, Dick Taylor and Peter Fletcher. Buxton then managed promotion to the Second Division in 1983 by finished third in the league and gaining automatic promotion. Over the following seasons Town struggled due to lack of investment and after being unable to return to the Top Division, Buxton was sacked just before Christmas in 1986 with the team in 22nd place. Youth Coach Steve Smith came in as caretaker manager and went four games unbeaten in the league and following his fifth match he became the permanent manager and remains to this day, the only permanent Huddersfield Town manager to come from Huddersfield. Smith saved the club from relegation by three points that season. After 10 games without a win at the beginning of the 1987\u201388 season, Smith was sacked and replaced by former Fulham manager Malcolm Macdonald."]}, {"page": "Peter Fletcher", "response": ["Peter Fletcher may refer to:", "*Peter Fletcher (footballer) (born 1953), English footballer", "*Peter Fletcher (RAF officer) (1916\u20131999), Royal Air Force officer"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Peter Fletcher"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Peter Fletcher"]}]}}
