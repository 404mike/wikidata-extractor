He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who moved the ball off the seam and became among the most effective bowlers in English county cricket during the 1970s. Presumably because his batting was impotent as shown by his highest first-class score in more than 200 matches being 26, Lee appears never to have been considered seriously for Test cricket. He toured South Africa twice with teams organised by Derrick Robins.\nLee played for five seasons from 1967 for Northamptonshire without ever becoming a regular in the side. He moved to Lancashire in 1972 largely as insurance for the likelihood that regular opening bowlers Peter Lever and Ken Shuttleworth would be called up for Test cricket by England, but with those bowlers doing extremely badly, Lee became their first choice opening bowler. 1973 saw Lee massively surpass his first season\u2019s promise and become the mainstay of Lancashire\u2019s bowling, actually taking more wickets in the County Championship than any other bowler.In 1974 Lee was consistently handicapped by injuries and illness: he played about half his county\u2019s matches but was at no point fully fit Nevertheless, he returned for a full season and even greater success in 1975. His 112 first-class wickets was the highest by any bowler that season: indeed the highest by any England-qualified bowler during the 1970s. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 1976 edition of the almanack.\nHaving reached the top of the tree as a bowler, Peter Lee remained one of the most persistent and hard-working county bowlers during 1976 and 1977, though he took only two-thirds as many wickets as he did in 1975. However, 1978 saw Lee play only one match due to a serious shoulder injury which led to a delayed operation after weeks of examination. Lee made a \"gallant\" return to fitness in 1979 but completely lost form, finishing with 22 wickets for 40 runs apiece that season. Indeed, apart from a career-best eight for 34 against Oxford University in 1980, Lee never again did much worthy of his former reputation, and at the end of 1982 he was released by Lancashire. After that, he played for Durham in the Minor Counties Championship during the 1983 season, but took only sixteen wickets for 29.56 apiece and was released.\nDuring the 20/20 Finals Day in August 2011, Paul Allott suggested Lee\u2019s decline coincided with the total loss of his run up, similar to the yips suffered mainly by left arm spinners.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Peter Lee"]}, {"page": "International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981", "response": ["*Brian Close (captain); Ray East; John Edrich; Bruce Francis (Australian); John Gleeson (Australian); Graham Johnson; Peter Lee; Graham Roope; John Snow; Roger Tolchard; Bob Woolmer (a South African, who was born in India and played for England)", "The members of touring party were (England unless stated): Phil Carrick, Trevor Chappell (Australia), Geoff Cope, John Douglas (Australia), Frank Hayes, Mike Hendrick, Geoff Howarth (New Zealand), Andrew Kennedy, Peter Lee, David Lloyd (captain), Derek Randall, Phil Slocombe, David Steele, Fred Titmus, Roger Tolchard, Gary Troup (New Zealand), Dav Whatmore (Australia)."]}, {"page": "1975 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden - Ian Chappell, Peter Lee, Rick McCosker, David Steele, Bob Woolmer", " || Peter Lee || 4799 || 199 || 2067 || 112 || 18.45"]}, {"page": "1973 English cricket season", "response": [" || Peter Lee || 4443 || 182 || 1901 || 101 || 18.82", " || Peter Lee || 4443 || 182 || 1901 || 101 || 18.82"]}, {"page": "Peter Lee", "response": ["Peter Lee may refer to:", "*Peter Lee (bishop of Christ the King) (born 1947), England-born Anglican bishop, working in South Africa", "*Peter Lee (bishop of Virginia) (born 1938), American bishop of the Episcopal Church", "*Peter Lee (chess player) (born 1943), English chess player", "*Peter Lee (computer scientist) (born 1960), American computer scientist", "*Peter Lee (cricketer) (born 1945), English cricketer", "*Peter Lee (ice hockey) (born 1956), ice hockey manager and retired player", "*Peter Lee (trade unionist) (1864\u20131935), mine union leader in County Durham, England", "*Peter Lee (engineer) (born 1954), Australian engineer and academic", "*Peter Lee Ka-kit (born 1963), vice-chairman and managing director of Henderson Land Development", "*Peter Lee Jung-sum (1939\u20132008), elder brother of Bruce Lee", "*Peter Lee,  arrested for allegedly giving submarine radar secrets to China; see Timeline of the Cox Report controversy", "*Peter Lee (director), Chinese film director", "*Peter Lee (Gaelic footballer) (born 1955), Irish Gaelic footballer"]}]}}
