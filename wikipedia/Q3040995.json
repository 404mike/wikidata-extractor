He is known as the \"Father of Marine Botany\".  The plant genus Carmichaelia is named after him.He was a friend of Sir William Hooker.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carmichaelia", "response": ["The formerly recognised genera Chordospartium, Corallospartium, Notospartium and Huttonella are now all included in Carmichaelia. The genera Carmichaelia, Clianthus (kakabeak), Montigena (scree pea) and Swainsona comprise the clade Carmichaelinae. Carmichaelia is named after Captain Dugald Carmichael, a Scottish army officer and botanist who studied New Zealand plants."]}, {"page": "St. Paul's fingerfin", "response": ["The St. Paul\u2019s fingerfin was first formally described as Chaetodon monodactylus in 1819 by the Scottish Army surgeon and botanist Dugald Carmichael with the type locality given as Tristan da Cunha. The specific name monodactylus means \u201cone fingered\u201d, a reference to the elongated 6th lowest fin ray in the pectoral fin.  Genetic and morphological analyses strongly support the placement of Nemadactylus in the family Latridae, alongside almost all of the other species formerly classified in the Cheilodactylidae."]}, {"page": "List of authors of South African botanical taxa", "response": ["*Dugald Carmichael (1772\u20131827) A, M, P, S ........

It lives chiefly in heaths dominated by Blechnum palmiforme, and Phylica arborea woodland. It is widespread and common on Tristan da Cunha and Inaccessible Island, but scarce on Nightingale Island, possibly due to a lack of habitat. It was first described by Dugald Carmichael in 1819 following the British annexation of Tristan da Cunha in 1816."]}, {"page": "Bovichtus", "response": ["Bovichtus was formally described as a genus in 1832 by the French zoologist Achille Valenciennes with Callionymus diacanthus, which had been described by the Scottish botanist and officer in the British Army Dugald Carmichael in 1819 with the type locality given as Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, as the type species. The name of the genus, Bovichtus, is derived from bovus meaning \u201cbull\u201d and ichthys which means fish, based on the local name for Bovichtus species in Valparaiso, Chile, torrito, meaning \u201clittle bull\u201d."]}, {"page": "Petalonema alatum", "response": ["Petalonema alatum is a cyanobacterium. It was first described and drawn by the Scottish author Dugald Carmichael under the taxonomic name Oscillatoria allata in 1826.  In 1833, Miles Joseph Berkeley re-published it under its current name Petalonema alatum. P. alatum produces a slime-like mucopolysaccharide in the form of interlocking slime funnels. The structure looks like a quill under the light microscope, which is where the species gets its name \"alatum\", meaning quill. These slime envelopes are up to 270 \u03bcm wide in diameter and are therefore visible by the naked eye as filiform formations (\"nema\" = floss).  The habitats for this filamentous cyanobacterium are mainly wet limestone walls and creates together with other bacteria, microalgae, bryophytes and micromycets gray or gray-brown biofilms. Populations of P. alatum have specialized cells - yellow heterocytes to bind atmospheric nitrogen which are in colour contrast to vegetative blue-green/turquoise cells in filamentous thallus."]}, {"page": "Christian Heinrich Friedrich Hesse", "response": ["Hesse was enthusiastic about natural history, especially entomology and botany, growing a large variety of succulents in his garden. His neighbour was the equally enthusiastic apothecary Peter Heinrich Poleman who provided a great deal of encouragement. He befriended and housed a number of visiting scientists, such as Hinrich Lichtenstein and Captain Dugald Carmichael. In 1808 he sent William John Burchell, then on the island of St Helena, a parcel of some 150 seeds, mainly from bulbous plants; Burchell stayed with Hesse once he arrived at the Cape in November 1810 and went on several botanising rambles with him. Dutch botanist Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt visited the Cape on his way to the East Indies early in 1816; he identified some Aloes from Hesse's garden and requested that Hesse collect plants for Martin van Marum, the Dutch physicist from Haarlem. Consequently, Hesse sent van Marum various species of Aloe, Cotyledon, Crassula, Stapelia and Euphorbia in 1817. Reverend Christian Ignatius Latrobe, who called in on the Cape in 1815-1816, praised Hesse's garden for its diversity of plants. Karl Heinrich Bergius visited the Cape in 1816-1818, became friendly with Hesse and went on botanical excursions with him. Hesse sent some Cape insects to the mineralogist Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann of G\u00f6ttingen, who visited Cape Town much later. According to Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt he also sent natural history objects to the physiologist and anatomist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in G\u00f6ttingen."]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Carmichael\"|Dugald Carmichael"]}, {"page": "Bovichtus diacanthus", "response": ["Bovichtus diacanthus was first formally described in 1819 as Callionymus diacanthusby the Scottish botanist and officer in the British Army Dugald Carmichael with the type locality given as Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, When Achille Valenciennes described the genus Bovichtus in 1832 the only species he classified within the new genus was Carmichael's C. diacanthus which is therefore the type species of Bovichtus. The specific name diacanthus means \"two spines\", a reference to the two robust, needle-shaped and sharp spines on the operculum which are erected when the gill membrane is expanded."]}]}}
