Basil Cave worked for the Foreign Office as a civil servant and was appointed Vice-Consul of British East Africa in 1891. In 1893 he was placed in command of a number of soldiers during civil disorder on Zanzibar and in 1895 was appointed Consul to the country. The Consul-General, AH Hardinge being away, Cave was responsible for starting the Anglo-Zanzibar War in 1896. He issued an ultimatum to Khalid bin Barghash who had seized the throne on the death of Sultan Hamad. The resulting 38-minute war, the shortest in history, ended with victory for Britain and the installation of their chosen Sultan, Hamoud bin Mohammed. \nCave was rewarded with appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1897 and accompanied Zanzibari Prince Ali bin Hamud to the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. He received promotion to Consul-General in 1903 and issued orders that resulted in the quelling of a mutiny in the Sultan's army in 1907. He left the country in 1909, being posted to Algeria where he was said to have worked hard to \"strengthen the friendship between the French and the British peoples\".

Before he could enter the palace, another potential contender for the throne, Sayyid Khalid bin Barghash, seized the palace and declared himself sultan. The British responded the next day, 26 August 1896, by issuing an ultimatum to Khalid and his entourage to evacuate the palace by 9:00 am on 27 August. When he refused, Royal Navy warships fired on the palace and other strategic locations in the city, causing Khalid and his group to flee. According to the Guinness Book of World Records the resultant Anglo-Zanzibar War was the shortest war in history, and the same day Hamoud was able to assume the title of sultan, more indebted to the British than ever."]}, {"page": "Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar", "response": ["Basil Cave, the British Consul, who had been Vice-Consul when Rennell Rodd had removed Khalid from succession three years earlier, informed the Foreign Secretary, Marquess of Salisbury, in September, that he \"remains in the house all the doors of which are guarded, from the inside, by about ten armed sailors or marines from a German man-of-war in harbour.

His 29-year-old nephew Khalid bin Bargash, who was suspected by some of his assassination, moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali. The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamoud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them. Khalid was warned by the consul and diplomatic agent to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions..

Khalid, a young man at the time, was disapproved of by the British authorities, who favoured the succession of the more pliable Hamud bin Muhammed. The immediate result of this was the declaration of war, the so-called Anglo-Zanzibar War, which lasted only a few minutes. After the bomardment of the town and palace, Khalid was forced to seek refuge in the German consulate. Basil Cave, the British representative there, informed the Foreign Secretary, Marquess of Salisbury, in September, that he \"remains in the house all the doors of which are guarded, from the inside, by about ten armed sailors or marines from a German man-of-war in harbour. The Consulate is being carefully and constantly watched by men in the service of Sir Lloyd Mathews\". In October 1896, Rechenberg wrote to Cave saying, \"Monsieur le Gerant, J'ai l'honneur de vous informer que mon Gouvemement m'a ordonne d'envoyer Chalid bin Bargash \u00e1 Dar-es-Salaam. Le transport sera effectue sans que Chalid touche le sol de Zanzibar\". ('To the Principal Officer: I beg to inform you that my Government has requested me to send Chalid bin Bargash to Dar es Salaam. The transportation will be carried out without Chalid setting foot on the soil of Zanzibar'). Events transpired as Rechenberg had outlined, and Khalid was conveyed by a ship anchored outside the Imperial Consulate safely to Dar es Salaam without Khalid stepping on Zanzibari soil.Frankl, P. J.
