He was an all-rounder, scoring six centuries and taking ten wickets in a match on two occasions by the end of his career.  He was killed on active service with the British Army during the Second World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Gimblett", "response": ["That Wisden assessment was made to look unduly modest within weeks of the start of the 1936 season. Regular opening batsman Jack Lee had been allowed to leave Somerset to become coach at Mill Hill School, and Gimblett was promoted to open the innings against the Indians in Somerset's first match of the season. He made 103 and then an unbeaten 46 as Somerset won the match by nine wickets after making the Indians follow on. In the very next match against Lancashire at Old Trafford, he did even better with 93 in the first innings and an unbeaten 160 in the second, when he held on with the Somerset tail-enders to deny Lancashire victory. That gave him fleetingly a season's batting average of more than 200, and he followed that up with a third century a week later against the admittedly weak Northamptonshire side. This form earned Gimblett selection for the Test trial match for the series against the Indian team, a match between North and South at Lord's that featured a mix of established Test players and up-and-coming young players. Gimblett failed in the match, scoring just four runs in his only innings. He was nonetheless selected for the England team for the first Test of the 1936 series in an experimental opening partnership with Arthur Mitchell of Yorkshire."]}, {"page": "Frank Lee (cricketer)", "response": ["Lee's brothers also played first-class cricket. Harry Lee, 15 years older than Frank Lee, was a batsman and spin bowler for Middlesex from 1911 to 1934 and played in one Test match. Jack Lee, three years older than Frank, played fleetingly for Middlesex and then pioneered the route down to Somerset, where he and Frank often opened the batting together."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Jack Lee (1925\u20131936) 241 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Jack Lee", "|align=left|Jack Lee"]}, {"page": "Philip Davey (cricketer)", "response": ["It was as a bowler that Davey enjoyed greater success. In his second game for Somerset, he took four wickets for 71 runs in Worcestershire's first innings, causing with Jack Lee a collapse that took Worcestershire from 292 for three to 332 all out. Just 10 days later, he improved those figures in another batting collapse with four for 49 against Derbyshire. Finally, in the return match with Worcestershire at Frome, he took six wickets for just nine runs in nine overs and two balls, the best figures of his career. Aside from these three innings, however, he took only five other wickets in the 1934 season. He returned for five matches in the 1935 season, and one in each of the 1936 and 1937 seasons, but without success."]}, {"page": "Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1905)", "response": ["Fred Lee was the second cricketer of this name to play for Somerset: he was not related to the earlier Fred Lee, and nor was he related to Frank Lee and Jack Lee, the London-born brothers who were his near-contemporaries in the Somerset side."]}, {"page": "Thomas MacDonald (cricketer)", "response": ["MacDonald made his first-class debut for Ireland against the West Indians at College Park, Dublin in 1928. He made five further first-class appearances for Ireland, the last of which came against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1936. In his six first-class matches for Ireland, he scored 255 runs at an average of 21.25, with a high score of 132. This score, which was his only first-class century, came against Scotland in 1928. While studying the University of Cambridge, MacDonald also made a single first-class appearance Cambridge University against Somerset in 1930. During this match he scored 29 runs in the Cambridge first-innings, before being dismissed by Jack Lee, while in their second-innings he was dismissed for 7 by Arthur Wellard."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who were killed during military service", "response": ["|Jack Lee"]}]}}
