Ordained in 1938 after a period of study at the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield, he began his career with curacies at St John's, Shildon and St James's, Gateshead.  He was Vicar of St Wilfrid's, Halton, Leeds, where he pioneered the House Church movement, and then Rural Dean of Whitkirk until 1961 when he was appointed Provost of Southwark Cathedral. He resigned Southwark in 1970 and became Vicar of Rishton in Lancashire.  He died on 17 January 1976.Southcott was notable for his height- six feet six inches- and his conducting of services in parishioners' houses, celebrating communion at family dinner tables. On this subject, Southcott pronounced: 'We don't go to church; we are the Church.' Nevertheless, his own services were so popular that the church was full half an hour before proceedings began. It took him 5 years to convince St. Wilfrid's parishioners that the baptismal font ought to be in the center of the church. For Southcott, baptism was a public occasion, at which the child is received into the church, and at which the entire congregation is present, to accept responsibility for the child and his future.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "House church", "response": ["The origins of the modern house church movement in North America and the UK are varied. Some have viewed it as a development and logical extension of the Plymouth Brethren movement, both in doctrine and practice. Many individuals and assemblies have adopted new approaches to worship and governance, while others recognize a relationship to the Anabaptists, the Free Christians, the Quakers, the Amish, the Hutterites, the Mennonites, the Moravians, the Methodists, the much earlier conventicles movement, the Waldenses or the Priscillianists. Another perspective sees the house church movement as a re-emergence of the move of the Holy Spirit during the Jesus Movement of the 1970s in the USA or the worldwide Charismatic Renewal of the late 1960s and 1970s. Others believe that the House Church movement was pioneered by the Reverend Ernest Southcott in the 1950s, when he was Vicar of St Wilfred's Church in Halton, Leeds, in England. Southcott believed that if people would not come to church, the church must go to the people, and his book The Parish Comes Alive spread this idea widely among Anglicans.The Parish Comes Alive by Ernie Southcott, London: Mowbray, 1961"]}, {"page": "Southcott", "response": ["* Ernest Southcott (1915\u20131976), Anglican priest"]}, {"page": "Ernest William Southcott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ernest Southcott"]}, {"page": "Dean of Southwark", "response": ["*1961\u20131970 Ernest Southcott"]}, {"page": "Southcott family", "response": ["=== Ernest Southcott ==="]}]}}
