Among his first publications in Ireland were two letters, from 1856, published in the Journal of the Kilkenny and South-East of Ireland Archaeological Society, urging the usefulness of the records of the Ordnance Survey in the Phoenix Park for studying the history of the neighbouring counties of Kilkenny and his native Laois. The usefulness of the Ordnance Survey and the importance of local histories and topographies were constant themes for O'Hanlon and he would write twenty further bulletins about the Ordnance Survey and the histories of other counties in Ireland.  Laois (which was known as Queen's County until 1922, but was always associated with the medieval kingdom of Lo\u00edgis or Leix) was always of particular interest to O'Hanlon and he worked on a two-volume History of the Queen's County (although this was only posthumously published in 1907), published articles on the \"Old Churches of Leix\" in the Irish Builder during the 1880s, and collected the works of Laois patriot, balladeer and mythologist John Keegan, while the best known of his own poems is the \"Land of Leix\".", "* Editor, Legends and Stories of John Keegan (with a memoir of Keegan by David James O'Donoghue) (Dublin, 1908)"]}]}}
