He previously launched and became the longest running presenter to date on rival station Belfast CityBeat from 1996 before his defection in 2010. Robinson is the Content Director of Downtown Radio, Cool FM and Downtown Country; this gives him control over the largest radio audience in Northern Ireland.\nFrom early 2015 he took over as host of Cool FM's flagship weekend show The Cool Saturday Show, seeing him repaired with David McCammond AKA Deputy Dave. The programme was a ratings success becoming the most listened to weekend radio show in Northern Ireland with over 100,000 listeners every Saturday morning. Deputy Dave left the show in 2019 and was replaced with Miss Northern Ireland Katharine Walker. \nThe Cool Saturday Show continued to enjoy success with the new dynamic  \u2018Stuart and Kat\u2019 for the next two years.\nIn 2021, Kat moved to her own programme and Deputy Dave once again returned as Robinson\u2019s on-air sidekick. The show has consistently remained the most listened to radio show at the weekend in Northern Ireland for over 6 years. \nBetween 2013 and 2014, Robinson hosted the weekday lunchtime programme on Downtown, stepping down when he took over as Programme Controller.\nAt Citybeat, he won gold and silver awards at the 2009 New York Festival Radio Awards and was also the only Irish radio presenter to be nominated for an Arqiva Award in both 2009 and 2008. He created the talent format Young Star Search and the introduction of popular sidekick characters 'Work Experience Boy' on Citybeat and \u2018Rodney\u2019 on Cool FM.\nIn April 2015 he presided over the launch of Downtown Country, Northern Ireland's first DAB only radio station.  This became the most successful radio launch in Northern Ireland since 1990, debuting with over 80,000 listeners and since growing to over 100,000 weekly listeners.
