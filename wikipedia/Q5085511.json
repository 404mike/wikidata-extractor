He then played a few games for Unity Gas before returning to Small Heath later the same year. Short, a natural goal poacher, played and scored regularly in the 1890\u201391 Football Alliance season. He also appeared in the 1890\u201391 FA Cup, taking part in the 8\u20130 defeat of Hednesford Town and then scoring the opening goal in a 2\u20130 victory against Wednesbury old Athletic in the Second Qualifying Round. However, following a complaint, it emerged that his registration, which had lapsed after he left the club, had not been renewed for that season's FA Cup, so Small Heath were disqualified from the competition for fielding an unregistered player.Short's older brother George also played professionally for Small Heath.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Hallam (footballer)", "response": ["In 1890, he moved to Small Heath, then playing in the Football Alliance, and made more than 150 appearances for the club in all competitions. The strength of Hallam's game lay in his speed, and he formed fine partnerships on the right side with both Charlie Short and Billy Walton. In Small Heath's first Football League season, they won the inaugural Second Division championship; Hallam contributed 17 goals, and was only outscored by future England international Fred Wheldon.Matthews, Complete Record, p.\u00a0141.

In the second qualifying round of the FA Cup, Small Heath had a harder time than perhaps they expected in beating Wednesbury Old Athletic by two goals.
