He was elected a fellow of his college, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1909.\nHe was appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal College of Science for Ireland in 1892 and professor of pure mathematics and applied mathematics when the college merged with University College Dublin in 1926.
