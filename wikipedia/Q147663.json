Royal peerages, often dukedoms, are bestowed upon most princes prior to marriage. Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, children of the Queen's daughter, Princess Anne, are therefore not prince and princess. Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James Mountbatten-Windsor, Viscount Severn, though entitled to the dignity, are not called prince and princess because their parents, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, wanted them to have more modest titles. Prince Charles reportedly wishes to reduce the number of titled members of the royal family when he becomes king."]}, {"page": "Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother", "response": ["|| Anne, Princess Royal || Peter PhillipsZara Tindall"]}, {"page": "Peerages in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The Sovereign, traditionally the fount of honour, cannot hold a British peerageThe opinion of the House of Lords in the Buckhurst Peerage Case stated that \"the fountain and source of all dignities cannot hold a dignity from him/herself\". (although the British Sovereign, whether male or female, is informally accorded the style of 'Duke of Lancaster'). All British subjects who were neither Royal nor Peers of the Realm were previously termed Commoners, regardless of wealth or other social factors; thus all members of a peer's family, with the exception of a wife or unmarried widow, are (technically) commoners too; the British system thus differs fundamentally from continental European versions, where entire families, rather than individuals, were ennobled. Nobility in Britain is based on title rather than bloodline, and correspondingly The Princess Royal (Princess Anne) who enjoys Royal status as daughter of The Queen, opted for her children to be Commoners by refusing offers of titles, despite their being grandchildren of the Sovereign (qv. Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall)."]}, {"page": "Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh", "response": ["| Zara Tindall"]}, {"page": "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge", "response": ["William is the godfather of Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark (b. 1998), a distant relation though his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Mia Tindall (b. 2014), the eldest child of his paternal cousin, Zara Tindall."]}, {"page": "Mark Phillips", "response": ["On 1 February 1997, Phillips married Sandy Pflueger, an American Olympic dressage rider.

It is for this reason that the daughters of the Duke of York, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, carry the HRH status, but the children of the Princess Royal, Peter Phillips, and Zara Tindall do not. The children of the Earl of Wessex, at the request of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, are styled as the children of an earl, and thus are known as Lady Louise and Viscount Severn. Under his letters patent, only the eldest son of the eldest living son of the Prince of Wales was also entitled to the style, but not younger sons or daughters of the eldest living son of the Prince of Wales. Queen Elizabeth II changed this in 2012 prior to the birth of Prince George of Cambridge so that all the children of the eldest living son of the Prince of Wales would bear the style. This returned it to the format Queen Victoria had instituted in 1898.https://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#1898 There is no mention of younger living sons of a Prince of Wales; however, in 2018, Prince Harry married Meghan Markle and they were awarded the titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Her title was styled as HRH The Duchess of Sussex. But Harry\u2019s son, Archie, is not automatically a British prince. On January 18, 2020, Queen Elizabeth II announced that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will no longer use the style of His/Her Royal Highness due to their decision to step down as working members of the British royal family, though they are still entitled (to the style)."]}]}}
