After the death of longtime Pink Floyd artist Storm Thorgerson in 2013, Pink Floyd collaborated with Aubrey Powell, co-founder of Thorgerson's design company Hipgnosis. Powell discovered 18-year-old Egyptian artist Ahmed Emad Eldin and asked to use the concept from his piece Beyond the Sky for The Endless River.  Eldin was a Pink Floyd fan and accepted enthusiastically. Powell felt Ahmed's concept had \"an instant Floydian resonance\", and described it as \"enigmatic and open to interpretation\". The final cover is a recreation of Eldin's work by London design firm Stylorouge.
