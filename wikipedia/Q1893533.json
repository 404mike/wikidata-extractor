This included releasing a postcard depicting the at the time Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Labour Party leader Harold Wilson in bed with his secretary Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender. Wilson sued, and as a result all further royalties from \"Flowers in the Rain\" were directed to a charity of Wilson's liking, an arrangement which is still enforced to this day.
