Born in Smethwick, Staffordshire, Morrall made 266 senior appearances for Birmingham, which included 243 top-flight League matches and the 1931 FA Cup Final at Wembley. He was a dominant defender, good both in the air and on the ground, and a fierce tackler. He went on to make more than 100 appearances for Third Division South club Swindon Town.

He was a strong, versatile player; originally a forward, he converted to defence, becoming first choice at centre half as the replacement for George Morrall, but was always keen to push forward. He sustained an injury playing for Birmingham in 1934 which resulted in him losing an eye some 15 years later."]}, {"page": "Jack Coxford", "response": ["Coxford was born in North Seaton, Ashington, Northumberland. He played for North Seaton Colliery and Stakeford United before joining Sunderland in 1924. He made his debut in the First Division on 18 April 1925, in a 1\u20131 draw at Blackburn Rovers, but never established himself as a first-team player. In April 1927, after only 11 games for Sunderland, Coxford joined fellow First Division club Birmingham. He was signed as cover for George Morrall, but the developing Tom Fillingham pushed Coxford down the pecking order, and after three years with the club in which he played only 16 games, he left for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic of the Third Division South. At Bournemouth, Coxford had four seasons of regular first-team football. Towards the end of the 1933\u201334 season, he played two games for nearby Poole Town before moving on to Northfleet United as player-coach., quoted in "]}, {"page": "Dick Butler (footballer)", "response": ["Butler was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. A centre half, he began his football career with Bestwood Colliery before joining Birmingham in May 1933. Because of the consistency of George Morrall and then of Tom Fillingham, Butler did not make his first-team debut until 12 September 1936, deputising for Fillingham in the First Division game at home to Stoke City which Birmingham lost 4\u20132.Matthews, p. 179. In nearly six years with the club, Butler was a major player for the reserve team in the Central League, but appeared only 11 times for the first team. In March 1939 he joined Crewe Alexandra, but played only six league games before the Second World War put an end to his professional career. During the war he made guest appearances for West Bromwich Albion."]}, {"page": "Ray Crawshaw", "response": ["Crawshaw was born in Padiham, Lancashire. He began his football career with local team Great Harwood, and had spells with Southport and Burnley, but without playing in the Football League. He joined Accrington Stanley in 1933, and played 19 games in the Third Division North before moving to First Division club Birmingham in April 1934 for a fee of \u00a3600. The form of George Morrall and Tom Fillingham restricted Crawshaw's appearances to four, and he returned to non-league football in 1934."]}, {"page": "Morrall", "response": ["*George Morrall (1905\u20131955), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Morrall, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Morrall"]}]}}
