Quinn became a Labour councillor from 1929\u201343, and was a trades union representative of the Tailors and Garment Workers from 1915\u201343.

She informed MPs: \"I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world\u2014I know I do not look like it, but I do\". The Woman's Leader described her as a \"vigorous, uncompromising feminist and an exceedingly tenacious, forcible and hard-headed politician\".Women's Leader, 7 November 1924, quoted in Vernon, p. 78. A policeman once attempted to prevent Wilkinson from entering the House of Commons' smoking room based on her sex; Wilkinson responded, \"I am not a lady - I am a Member of Parliament.\" As an unofficial spokesperson for women's rights, Wilkinson encouraged open debate on birth control, reprimanding Catholic trades unionist Bertha Quinn for calling it a 'crime' at a Labour Women's convention in 1925.  Wilkinson went on to achieve one of her first parliamentary victories in that same year, when she persuaded the government to correct anomalies affecting widows in its Pensions Bill.Bartley, pp. 35\u201336. In March 1926, she combined with Lady Astor from the Conservative benches to attack the government's proposed decrease in expenditure on women's training centres. Wilkinson's ODNB biographer, Brian Harrison, acknowledges that while \"women's issues\" were often to the fore in her speeches, she was primarily a socialist rather than a feminist, and if forced to decide between them would have chosen the former."]}, {"page": "List of people from Leeds", "response": ["* Bertha Quinn - suffragette, socialist, Labour councillor 1929\u20131943, recipient of Papal Bene Merenti Medal 1946"]}, {"page": "List of people from Middlesbrough", "response": ["* Bertha Quinn, (1873 -1951) suffragette, Labour Councillor and recipient of Papal Bene Merenti Medal"]}, {"page": "Theresa Garnett", "response": ["In 1907, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) after being inspired by a speech given by Adela Pankhurst.13 novembre 1909.
