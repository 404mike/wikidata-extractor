Recent research shows, however, that she inherited a life interest in Wanstead Grove, a neighbouring property to Wanstead House, as well as (by codicil) in a London house, both under the will of her maternal uncle, George Bowles (1732 - 1817), a collector of works by Angelica Kauffman, Andrew Plimer, and Henry Bone. George Bowles, whose family's prosperity came initially from a glass-making business, also left an interest in Burford House, Shropshire, to Anne's brother, the Rev. George Rushout (who became Rushout-Bowles to reflect the inheritance from his mother's family), whose son George Rushout, 3rd Baron Northwick succeeded his uncle."]}]}}
