These authors divide the costs of communication into two components, (1) the investment necessary to ensure transmission of a discernible signal; (2) the investment necessary to guarantee that each signal is reliable and not a fake. The authors point out that although costs in the second category may be relatively low, they are not zero. Even in relatively relaxed, cooperative social contexts\u00a0\u2014 for example, when communication is occurring between genetic kin\u00a0\u2014 some investment must be made to guarantee reliability. In short, the notion of super-efficient communication\u00a0\u2014 eliminating all costs except those necessary for successful transmission\u00a0\u2014 is biologically unrealistic. Yet speech comes precisely into this category."]}, {"page": "Witherby Memorial Lecture", "response": ["|2000||David Harper ||The public and private lives of Robins"]}, {"page": "D. G. C.
