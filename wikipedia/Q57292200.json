Trevor Phillips, when chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said in 2006: \"Asquith's stand against discrimination brought to light the inadequacy of early race discrimination laws and persistent widespread discrimination faced by ethnic minorities.\" A plaque at the station commemorates his achievement.", "link_mentions": {}}}
