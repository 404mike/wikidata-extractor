U.F.Orb reached number one on the UK Albums Chart to the shock of critics, who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be progressive rock.  Heavily influenced by The Orb and U.F.Orb in particular, many trip hop groups sprang up emulating The Orb's \"chill-out blueprint\".  U.F.Orb expresses The Orb's fascination with alien life with its bizarre sound samples and in the album's title itself.

The chaotic Pomme Fritz moved the group away from their melodic, ambient sound towards a more abstract, experimental style, incorporating instances of noise, sampling, fragmented rhythms, industrial textures, indecipherable voices, and sound collage techniques.

Their plan was to record one track and then \"mix it down into six very different versions.\" Recorded in London and Berlin from 1993 to 1994 using an expensive budget on behalf of Island, Pomme Fritz was produced with ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape), and group leader Alex Paterson also believes it to be the first Orb album to use ProTools, which was operated on a Mac. He later told PopMatters that the album was recorded when the Orb were being \"used and abused by bad management\" and his goal was to \"keep the Orb's dream alive.\" Pomme Fritz was the Orb's first album with German techno producer Thomas Felhmann, who has remained a part-time member of the group.
