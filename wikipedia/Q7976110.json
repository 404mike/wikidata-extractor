Fulham dominated the first half, but five minutes before half-time, they were reduced to ten men when Paul Moody was shown a straight red card for a foul on Mark Lever.  While Grimsby were making a substitution to replace the injured Lever, Paul Peschisolido was fouled in the penalty area and Peter Beardsley converted the subsequent penalty to make it 1\u20130 to Fulham.  A mistake eight minutes into the second half from Wayne Collins allowed David Smith to equalise for Grimsby.  No further goals were scored and the match ended 1\u20131.  The second leg took place at Blundell Park near Grimsby four days later.  After thirty minutes, Fulham were once again down to ten players after Peschisolido was sent off for a foul on Peter Handyside.
