Bodkin was educated at the Christian Brothers' school, Tuam and at Tullabeg Jesuit College. He had wanted to go to the Anglican Trinity College, Dublin but his family objected on religious grounds and he attended the Catholic University of Ireland, which had a strong Roman Catholic ethos, instead. He was scathing about this experience:\"It is true I entered the so-called Catholic University, which had neither charter or endowment, and even obtained an exhibition on matriculation, but the business was so wholly futile that I abandoned it before six months was over, sacrificing my exhibition. A smattering of Terence was the only asset derived from that wasted six months.\"Bodkin (1914), p. 25."]}, {"page": "Anthony MacDonnell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell"]}, {"page": "Anthony Patrick MacDonnell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell"]}, {"page": "Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell of Swinford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell"]}, {"page": "Antony Patrick MacDonnell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell"]}, {"page": "Lord MacDonnell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell"]}, {"page": "Anthony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell"]}, {"page": "Sir Antony MacDonnell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Antony MacDonnell, 1st Baron MacDonnell"]}]}}
