After Ron \"Chopper\" Harris had poleaxed Matthews in one game Clamp threatened Harris, only to be admonished by the referee, an angry Clamp said \"Thats the trouble with you referees. You don't care which side wins!\" Matthews said in his autobiography that this was one of the greatest lines ever said on a football pitch. He was described as 'mad' by Stoke trainer Frank Mountford and on more than one occasion he would headbutt an opponent whilst the referee's attention was diverted. He played 28 times for the \"Potters\" in 1963\u201364 helping Stoke to reach the League Cup final.

He and a number of younger players played for Stoke during the War and was a regular in the side until the Football League resumed in 1946\u201347 where his place was taken by George Antonio. Frank Mountford's injury in January opened the door for the 22-year-old Sellars to take his chance and he filled in a right half easily, playing a vital role as Stoke fell short of winning their first ever League title. In 1947\u201348 Sellars had to fill in around Stoke's injury ravaged team, playing at full-back, right-wing and even centre-forward before finding his place at left-half replacing Jock Kirton despite being right footed. Manager Bob McGrory described Sellars as 'a managers dream' for his willingness to play in any position. Known also for his consistency, Sellars was ever present in 1948\u201349 and missed only three games over the next two seasons."]}, {"page": "George Mountford (footballer, born 1921)", "response": ["Mountford was born in Kidderminster and began his career playing for local side Kidderminster Harriers before joining Stoke City in December 1942 for a fee of \u00a340.

With Stanley Matthews on wartime duty with Blackpool Mountford took his number 7 shirt and Matthews struggled to win it back.
