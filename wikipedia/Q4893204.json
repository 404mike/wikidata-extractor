It was built over a number of years from the late 1780s, commissioned by Walter May in an ornate Gothic style. The architect was  J. Dugdale. His son, Walter Barton May inherited the estate in 1823, and another inheritance in 1832 from his wife's family. He added a  octagonal tower in 1838, the architect was George Ledwell Taylor. A  octagonal lantern was added in 1840 and another smaller tower was added in 1852. This was dismantled in 1905. Walter Barton May died in 1858 and the estate was sold. Subsequent owners were Robert Rodger, JP, High Sheriff of Kent, in 1865. He died in 1882 and the castle was bought by Dr. MacGeagh, a Harley Street specialist in 1891. He would drive in his carriage to Tonbridge and catch the train to London thus being an early commuter. The castle passed to T E Foster MacGeagh and he sold it in 1919 to Henry Thomas Pearson, whose family occupied it until 1946. During the Second World War it was used as a watchtower by the Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps. The unoccupied castle changed hands several times after the Pearsons left, and was demolished in 1951,Hadlow Castle except for the servants' quarters, several stables and the Coach House, which was saved by the painter Bernard Hailstone. The Tower was already a Listed Building, having been listed on 17 April 1951. Now the entrance gateway and lodges of the Castle still stand - a heavy Gothic presence on the street - as does the Stable Court with two turreted pavilions, which are all in private ownerships, and new homes have been built in the grounds."]}, {"page": "Hadlow", "response": ["*Bernard Hailstone (1910\u201387), artist, lived in Hadlow and saved the tower of Hadlow Castle from demolition."]}, {"page": "War artist", "response": ["* Bernard Hailstone, 1910\u20131987"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* Bernard Hailstone (1910\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "Gordon Bastian", "response": ["Bastian received his GC in a presentation made by the Governor-General of Canada on 27 November 1973.
