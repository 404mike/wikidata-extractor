After having studied French, Spanish and Latin (he later supported the Latinitas Viva or Living Latin movement), he came into contact with constructed auxiliary languages such as Esperanto and Volap\u00fck. He started a long correspondence with Arie de Jong, the reformer of the Volap\u00fck language, and with the previous cifals Johann Schmidt and F. J. Kr\u00fcger. He learned Volap\u00fck, and became a subscriber and contributor to the Volap\u00fckagased: Z\u00e4nagased pro Volap\u00fckanef (Volap\u00fck Journal: Central Journal for Volap\u00fckists), where he published several of his translations. In 1979, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the creation of Volap\u00fck, Brian Bishop wrote to a number of newspapers and radio stations to mention the fact, which led to some attention being given to it. Encouraged by the ensuing interest, he created the Z\u00e4nab\u00fcr Volap\u00fcka (Volap\u00fck Central Office), where he collected many Volap\u00fck memorabilia (mostly from F. J. Kr\u00fcger's collection). In 1981, he became vice-Cifal (via an edict by Cifal Kr\u00fcger dated October 13, 1981), and two years later he became Cifal (via an edict by Cifal Kr\u00fcger dated January 1, 1984).\nCurrently, Brian Bishop is involved in the reorganization of the Kad\u00e4m Volap\u00fcka (Academy of Volap\u00fck) and of the Volap\u00fck Movement, for which he has published new statutes. Its first official activities started in 2007. He is also a participant in the Volap\u00fck discussion group, which unites most living Volap\u00fckists.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian R.
