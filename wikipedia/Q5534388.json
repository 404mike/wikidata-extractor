He was the son of former jockey and trainer Harry Wragg, from whom he took over the licence at Abington Place, Newmarket in 1983 upon his father's retirement. Wragg retired in 2008 after 25 years of training and sold Abington Place to Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Maktoum the following spring. He relocated to Yorkshire, the birthplace of his late father, Harry Wragg. He died in 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epsom Derby", "response": ["| Geoff Wragg"]}, {"page": "Teenoso", "response": ["Teenoso showed little worthwhile form as a two-year-old in 1982.
