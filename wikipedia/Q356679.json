He became known as a victim of a miscarriage of justice for having served three years' hard labour after being convicted on a charge of injuring a pony. He was initially regarded having been responsible for the series of animal mutilations known as the 'Great Wyrley Outrages', but the prosecution case against him became regarded as weak and prejudiced.  He was pardoned on the grounds of the conviction being an unsafe one after a campaign in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle took a prominent role. The difficulty in overturning the conviction of Edalji was cited as showing that a better mechanism was needed for reviewing unsafe verdicts, and it was a factor in the 1907 creation of the Court of Criminal Appeal for England. Despite an official inquiry's finding that Edalji was the author of poison pen letters associated with the mutilations, he  was allowed to resume practice as a solicitor and lived quietly with a sibling until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Penkridge", "response": ["* George Edalji (1876 in Penkridge \u2013 1953) a Parsi English solicitor  The Plebeian website, Conan Doyle and the Parson\u2019s son: The George Edalji Case retrieved December 2017 who served three years' hard labour after being convicted on a charge of injuring a pony.
