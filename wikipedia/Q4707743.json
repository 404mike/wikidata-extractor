Shifting to programme production he came to know the producer Cedric Messina, responsible for adaptations of classic plays, and worked with him on such anthology series as Play of the Month. Under Messina, Shallcross worked as script editor on the first twelve productions in the BBC Television Shakespeare cycle.He was the producer of such single plays (in this case with Jack Levin) as Ian Curteis' Churchill and the Generals (1979) and several episodes of the BBC2 Playhouse series. In 1983 he produced To the Lighthouse, an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's novel of the same name. One of his last productions was a serial adaptation of the Oswald Wynd novel The Ginger Tree (1989) co-produced by the BBC, Japanese broadcaster NHK and WGBH Boston from the novel of the same name. Alan Shallcross retired in the late 1990s, moving to Settle in Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC Television Shakespeare", "response": ["The BBC Television Shakespeare project was the most ambitious engagement with Shakespeare ever undertaken by either a television or film production company. So large was the project that the BBC could not finance it alone, requiring a North American partner who could guarantee access to the United States market, deemed essential for the series to recoup its costs. In their efforts to source this funding, the BBC met with some initial good luck. Cedric Messina's script editor, Alan Shallcross, was the cousin of Denham Challender, executive officer of the New York branch of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Challender knew that Morgan were looking to underwrite a public arts endeavour, and he suggested the Shakespeare series to his superiors. Morgan contacted the BBC, and a deal was quickly reached. However, Morgan was only willing to invest about one-third of what was needed (approximately \u00a31.5\u00a0million/$3.6\u00a0million). Securing the rest of the necessary funding took the BBC considerably longer \u2013 almost three years.", "Another major aspect of the promotional work was supplementary educational material. For example, the BBC had their books division issue the scripts for each episode, prepared by script editor Alan Shallcross (seasons 1 and 2) and David Snodin (seasons 3 and 4) and edited by John Wilders. Each publication included a general introduction by Wilders, an essay on the production itself by Henry Fenwick, interviews with the cast and crew, photographs, a glossary, and annotations on textual alterations by Shallcross, and subsequently Snodin, with explanations as to why certain cuts had been made."]}, {"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Harry H.
