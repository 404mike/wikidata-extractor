From 1895 until 1907, he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy. In 1896 he married the painter Lily Blatherwick, the daughter of Charles Blatherwick from his first marriage. The couple settled in Tresham in Gloucestershire, from where they both pursued their artistic careers; they both had works shown at the Continental Gallery in 1901. Hatrick and his wife later redecorated the small church in Tresham and she is buried in the graveyard there. Hartrick moved to London, where he taught drawing at the Camberwell School of Art from 1908 to 1914 and later at the Central School of Art, where he taught lithography until 1929. At Camberwell he taught David Jones. In 1909 Hartrick was among the founding members of the Senefelder Club and later became a Vice-President of the club. In 1910 Hartrick was elected an associate member of the Royal Watercolour Society and became a full member in 1920. Eventually Hartrick had over 200 works shown at the Royal Watercolour Society and he also exhibited at the Venice Biennale on three occasions. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. A series of his works showing rural characters, entitled Cotswold Types was acquired by the British Museum."]}, {"page": "Women Painters of the World", "response": ["*Lily Blatherwick"]}]}}
