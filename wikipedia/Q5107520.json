Both psychologists have appeared in BBC radio broadcasts and featured heavily in the popular media in Britain and elsewhere, such as The Guardian, the New York Times Magazine, New Scientist, The Independent and Der Spiegel.Moulin completed his PhD (\"Does a metacognitive deficit contribute to the episodic memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease?\") at Bristol University in 1999 under the supervision of Tim Perfect and Alan Baddeley. He then held various Research Fellowships at the Universities of Bristol, Reading and at a Clinical Research Institute at Bath (RICE) and worked in the Institute of Psychological Sciences, University of Leeds between 2002 and 2012. In 2004 and 2005 Moulin organised the BPS Cognitive Section Conference, held in Leeds. He was on the editorial board of the journal Memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu", "response": ["The feeling has been evoked through semantic satiation.

In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of jamais vu, such as beginning to doubt that \"door\" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic jamais vu."]}, {"page": "Microsoft SenseCam", "response": ["SenseCams have mostly been used in medical applications, particularly to aid those with poor memory as a result of disease or brain trauma. Several studies have been published by Chris Moulin, Aiden R. Doherty and Alan F. Smeaton showing how reviewing one's SenseCam images can lead to what Martin A. Conway, a memory researcher from the University of Leeds, calls \"Proustian moments\", characterised as floods of recalled details of some event in the past. SenseCams have also been used in lifelogging, and one researcher at Dublin City University, Ireland, has been wearing a SenseCam for most of his waking hours, since 2006, and has generated over 13 million SenseCam images of his life."]}, {"page": "Moulin (surname)", "response": ["*Chris Moulin, English psychologist"]}]}}
