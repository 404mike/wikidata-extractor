When it received its first professional revival in December 1920 in Glasgow \u2013 and then in London, in October 1921 \u2013 the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a number of further cuts and changes that were incorporated in scores and used in subsequent D'Oyly Carte productions and recordings.Some of the cuts and changes seen in most modern scores may have been made after that date.  Two recordings from the period, in 1924 and 1931, do not agree on a musical text, which suggests that the changes were not made all at once. David Russell Hulme, editor of the Oxford University Press 2000 scholarly edition of the score, has attributed the cuts and other changes to the music principally to Harry Norris, musical director of the D'Oyly Carte at the time of the Glasgow revival, and the modifications to the opera's orchestration, as well as the new overture, to Geoffrey Toye.  He concluded that some lesser changes may have been made by Malcolm Sargent, but in a few cases Hulme was uncertain as to which conductor was responsible for which change.
