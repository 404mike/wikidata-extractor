War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s.  Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and commercial success of  Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953). Like others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like The Dam Busters (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain in 1955,\"'The Dam Busters'.\" Times [London, England], 29 December 1955, p. 12 via The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved: 11 July 2012. and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, though, partly because it celebrated an \"exclusively British [victory]\", it failed in the American market. A large number of war films were made in the 1955\u201358 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That Got Away and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year, and Paths of Glory were released. Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end of the decade the \"sense of shared achievement\" which had been common in war films \"began to evaporate\", according to Pulver."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay", "response": ["| The novel by Nicholas Monsarrat"]}, {"page": "Corvette", "response": ["* The collection Three Corvettes by Nicholas Monsarrat recounts the writer's World War II experiences on corvettes, starting as an inexperienced small-boat sailor and ending as captain.", "* The novel The Cruel Sea (1951), also by Nicholas Monsarrat, about the life and death of a Flower-class corvette and the men in her, is regarded as one of the classic naval stories of World War II."]}, {"page": "James Brooke", "response": ["Fictionalised accounts of Brooke's exploits in Sarawak include Kalimantaan by C.

The Iceland route also provided adequate air cover and escort refuelling for allied convoys.
