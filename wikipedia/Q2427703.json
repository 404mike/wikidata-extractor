He was a friend of Joseph Dalton Hooker and helped write the first volume of Flora Indica. \nHe was born in Glasgow the son of Thomas Thomson, chemistry professor at Glasgow University. He qualified as an M.D. at Glasgow University in 1839, as was appointed Assistant Surgeon in the Bengal Army 21 December 1839. \nHe served during the campaign in Afghanistan 1839-1842 being present at the capture of Ghazni in 1839 and was taken prisoner at Ghazni in March 1842 but was released 21 September 1842. He served in the Sutlej campaign, 1845\u201346, being present at Firuzshahr, and in the second Sikh war, 1848\u201349. \nDuring 1847\u201348, Thomson served on the Kashmir Boundary Commission under the leadership of Alexander Cunningham. (Henry Strachey was the other commissioner.) Thomson explored the northern frontier of Kashmir, along the Karakoram Range.He was promoted Surgeon on 1 December 1853 and Surgeon Major on 21 December 1859.\nHe became Superintendent of the Honourable East India Company's Botanic Garden at Calcutta and was the Naturalist to and Member of the Tibet Mission. He was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1855 and retired 25 September 1863.

Because it shares the combination of ligulate florets, spurred anthers, and involucres that consist of several whorls of overlapping bracts, the species was initially assigned to the tribe Mutisieae sensu lato, but genetic analysis has since shown that this grouping constitutes a basal evolutionary grade, which has been consequently divided into nine subfamilies. and  cited in  However, further characters of Catamixis are shared with different of these subfamilies or the subdivisions they include, but always elements of the unique character combinations of these subfamilies are lacking in Catamixis. More recently, Catamixis was assumed to be associated with the  tribe Pertyeae. Catamixis lacks a deletion of 17 base pairs close to one of the chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase genes, that is a common character for members of the subfamilies Gymnarrhenoideae, Cichorioideae, Corymbioideae and Asteroideae. Catamixis, Pertya, Myripnois and two of the Ainsliaea-species share a deletion of 145 base pairs not found in any lineage except Pertyoideae. A point mutation in the maturase K gene is shared with the genera Ainsliaea and Pertya, which belong to the Pertyoideae. This makes it very likely that Catamixis should be included in the Pertyoideae, but does not fully resolve the position within that subfamily."]}]}}
