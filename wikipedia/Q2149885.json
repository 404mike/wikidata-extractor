By the early 2010s, the term \"electronic dance music\" and the initialism \"EDM\" was being pushed by the American music industry and music press in an effort to rebrand American rave culture. Despite the industry's attempt to create a specific EDM brand, the initialism remains in use as an umbrella term for multiple genres, including dance-pop, house, techno and electro, as well as their respective subgenres.Richard James Burgess (2014), The History of Music Production, page 115, Oxford University PressEDM \u2013 ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC, Armada Music", "The earliest use of the term \"electronic dance music\" (EDM) was by English musician, producer, manager, and innovator Richard James Burgess in 1980, whose single \"European Man\" with his band Landscape used the term on the back of the single's record sleeve: \"Electronic Dance Music... EDM; computer programmed to perfection for your listening pleasure.\" Burgess is therefore known as having coined the term, as well as \"New Romantic\". In response to a question about being credited with coining the term New Romantic in an interview with The Electricity Club, Burgess said: \"Initially I was using three terms \u2013 Futurist, Electronic Dance Music (the Landscape singles have EDM printed on them) and New Romantic.\" In the United States, the term was used as early as 1985, although the term \"dance music\" did not catch on as a blanket term.[95] Writing in The Guardian, journalist Simon Reynolds noted that the American music industry's adoption of the term EDM in the late 2000s was an attempt to re-brand US \"rave culture\" and differentiate it from the 1990s rave scene. It has been described as an era of electronic music, being described in a MixMag article as being \"the drop-heavy, stadium-filling, fist-pumping, chart-topping, massively commercial main stage sound that conquered America...possibly somewhere between electro and progressive house, directed by Michael Bay, and like many music genres, trying to pin it down exactly is like trying to grab a fistful of water\". In the UK, \"dance music\" or \"dance\" are more common terms for EDM.[4] What is widely perceived to be \"club music\" has changed over time; it now includes different genres and may not always encompass EDM. Similarly, \"electronic dance music\" can mean different things to different people. Both \"club music\" and \"EDM\" seem vague, but the terms are sometimes used to refer to distinct and unrelated genres (club music is defined by what is popular, whereas EDM is distinguished by musical attributes).[96] Though Billboard debuted a \"dance\" chart in 1974, the larger US music industry did not create music charts until the late 1990s.[93] In July 1995, Nervous Records and Project X Magazine hosted the first awards ceremony, calling it the \"Electronic Dance Music Awards\".[Note 4]"]}, {"page": "Go Bang!", "response": ["The band was under considerable pressure from Island Records to produce a hit from this album and British hitmaker Richard James Burgess was brought in to produce and mix the album.
