As the diameter of the lens increases (i.e., with increasing aperture), the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the sine condition, sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the sine condition then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called aplanatic (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering).  This word was first used by Robert Blair to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration as well."]}, {"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Robert Blair (1748\u20131828), aplanatic telescope", "* Robert Blair (1837\u20131907), Church of Scotland minister"]}, {"page": "1828", "response": ["** Robert Blair,  Scottish astronomer (b. 1748)"]}, {"page": "Robert Blair", "response": ["Robert Blair may refer to:", "* Robert Blair (poet) (1699\u20131746), Scottish poet", "* Robert Blair (musician) (1930\u20132001), American gospel musician", "* Robert Blair, Lord Avontoun (1741\u20131811), Scottish lawyer, son of poet Robert Blair", "* Robert Blair (politician) (died 1861), English-born judge and politician in Nova Scotia", "* Robert Blair (cricketer) (1858\u20131912), New Zealand cricketer", "* Robert Blair (badminton) (born 1981), badminton player from Great Britain", "* Robert Blair (moderator) (1593\u20131666), Scottish clergyman", "* Robert Blair (minister) (1837\u20131907), Scottish minister", "* Robert Blair (astronomer) (1748\u20131828), Scottish astronomer", "* Robert Blair (VC) (1834\u20131859), Victoria Cross winner", "* S.
