This was achieved with impressive victories away to Bolton, and victories at home to Wrexham and (then) Premier League Nottingham Forest before the infamous semi-final tie with Middlesbrough at Old Trafford which ended in a 3\u20133 draw. Chesterfield even had a contentious goal that was not given by Referee David Elleray; Jonathan Howard took a shot which hit the underside of the crossbar and appeared to cross the line and yet the goal was never given. Had it been awarded as a goal it would have put Chesterfield 3\u20131 up against ten-man Middlesbrough (after the earlier dismissal of Vladim\u00edr Kinder) with just over 20 minutes remaining. As it was, Middlesbrough equalised to make it 2\u20132 after 90 minutes, and it finished 3\u20133 after extra time. Jamie Hewitt's last minute equaliser in extra time resulted in Duncan celebrating so wildly he lost his glasses. Chesterfield were defeated in the replay 3\u20130 at Hillsborough.
