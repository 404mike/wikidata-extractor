He was a skilled painter of landscapes and marine subjects, became professor of drawing at the Royal Naval School and produced books on painting and drawing. He contributed 258 watercolours of scenes from Bristol, England to the topographical collection of George Weare Braikenridge. The Braikenridge Collection makes Bristol's early 19th century appearance one of the best documented of any English city.Rowbotham was born in Bath, Somerset in 1782, where he became a teacher of marine painting, cottage figures and landscape. His father had become owner of the Theatre Royal, Bath. Thomas moved to Dublin around 1812, where his son Thomas Charles Leeson Rowbotham (1823\u201375) was born.By 1825, when he started working for Braikenridge, he had moved to Bristol. Besides the 258 watercolours, he also produced around 100 drawings for Braikenridge depicting views of Brislington, Bristol. In 1832 he also produced some large panoramas of Bristol. In 1832 and 1833 he collaborated with William James M\u00fcller to produce engravings  of the Bristol Riots of 1831.Rowbotham does not seem to have participated in the activities of the Bristol School of artists. However, in late 1832 or early 1833 Rowbotham was a founder member of the formal sketching club for evening sketching meetings, which was the successor of the more informal Bristol School.Later he became professor of drawing at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, London. He wrote The Art of Landscape Painting in Watercolours, jointly with his son, and The Art of Sketching from Nature, for which his son provided the illustrations.He died in 1853 at Camberwell, London. His professorship at the Royal Naval School was taken over by his son.The Braikenridge Collection is in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rowbotham", "response": ["* Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham (1782\u20131853), British painter"]}, {"page": "Thomas Charles Leeson Rowbotham", "response": ["Thomas Charles Leeson Rowbotham (1823 in Dublin \u2013 30 June 1875 in Percy Lodge, Camden Hill, Kensington), Irish watercolour landscape and marine artist and lithographer, was the son of the watercolour artist, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham (1783\u20131853). He was trained by his father and first did serious work in 1847 on a sketching trip to Wales.  His work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and Suffolk Street Gallery and other prestigious galleries of the time and he was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1848 and a full member in 1851.

This initially included William James M\u00fcller, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham, John Skinner Prout and Robert Tucker, according to Tucker's own account. The meetings later grew to include more artists, although relatively few surviving drawings have been identified, compared to the meetings of the 1820s, and by the 1830s the works of the Bristol School were less original. Other participants in the meetings probably included Samuel Jackson, Stephen C. Jones, James Baker Pyne, Henry Brittan Willis, W. Williams, Joseph Walter, George Arthur Fripp, Edmund Gustavus M\u00fcller, and William Evans. These sketching meetings may have lasted into the 1840s."]}, {"page": "George Weare Braikenridge", "response": ["He had a further collection of over 1400\u00a0drawings and watercolours of Bristol landscapes and buildings, which he also organised in line with the chapters of Barrett's book.
