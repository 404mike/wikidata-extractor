One could even say that his novels have a soundtrack. London itself is associated by Karim to a sound. \"There was a sound that London had. It was, I'm afraid, people in Hyde Park playing bongos with their hands; there was also the keyboard on The Doors' \"Light My Fire\". There were kids in velvet cloaks who lived free lives\".     Within the problems of prejudice and racism lies one of the themes of initiation novels: the question of identity. Furthermore, London seems to be the perfect setting for the protagonists' \"often painful growth towards maturity through a range of conflicts and dilemmas, social, sexual and political.\" (Bart Moore-Gilbert, 2001, 113) These characterisations mark Kureishi's novels as examples of Bildungsromane and novels of initiation."]}, {"page": "Bart moore-gilbert", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bart Moore-Gilbert "]}, {"page": "Abdirahman Hussein", "response": ["Abdirahman Hussein (born in Hargeisa, Somaliland) is a scholar and teacher who taught at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. He is best known for his book on Edward Said, Edward Said: Criticism and Society (London: Verso, 2002), in which he offers a critical study of Said and his influences. The book was praised by Bart Moore-Gilbert for its \"judicious critique\" of Moore-Gilbert's own 1997 study of Said in which, he says, he did not pay sufficient attention to the \"Palestinian dimensions and orientations of Said's thinking\". Also noted is Hussein's \"triangulation\" of Joseph Conrad, whose Heart of Darkness is, according to Hussein, \"foundational to Said's entire career and project\". One of Hussein's focal points is Said's 1976 book Beginnings: Intention and Method, whose importance he says is overlooked."]}]}}
