She played the part for twelve and a half years between 2 May 1955 and 26 November 1967, with a break between 20 November 1960 and 6 November 1961 when she was replaced by the actress Madoline Thomas. When asked in 1967 why she was leaving the cast Miss Monte replied \"I think I have earned a rest.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Mousetrap", "response": ["Since the retirement of Mysie Monte and David Raven, who each made history by remaining in the cast for more than 11 years, in their roles as Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf, the cast has been changed annually. The change usually occurs around late November around the anniversary of the play's opening, and was the initiative of Sir Peter Saunders, the original producer. There is a tradition of the retiring leading lady and the new leading lady cutting a \"Mousetrap cake\" together."]}]}}
