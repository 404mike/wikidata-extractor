It has been described by the Highways Agency as \"a vital transport link for the national and South East economies\", by the former Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, as \"a crucial part of the country's strategic road network\", and by the local Thurrock Council as \"one of Europe's most heavily used crossings and complex traffic management systems\". It is signed as a major destination on London's orbital route, the M25, though the crossing and its approach road are an all-purpose road (the A282), allowing some (though not all) non-motorway traffic to use it. Southbound traffic crosses the four-lane bridge, while northbound traffic uses both of the two-lane road tunnels. The bridge can be closed due to high winds or maintenance. On these occasions, traffic uses the tunnels in both directions. The crossing and its approaches, like most UK motorways, are equipped with lane control and variable message signs to manage traffic."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Patrick McLoughlin", "| Patrick McLoughlin"]}, {"page": "Richard Branson", "response": ["In August 2012, when re-tendered the InterCity West Coast franchise was awarded to FirstGroup after a competitive tender process overseen by the Department for Transport.

The relationship between the parties was formalised after the 2017 United Kingdom general election with the signing of the Conservative\u2013DUP agreement. In October 2017, the DUP held a similar reception at the Conservative Party conference, which was attended by leading Conservative figures including First Secretary of State Damian Green, Brexit Secretary David Davis, then-Chief Whip Gavin Williamson, and party chairman Patrick McLoughlin. This was reciprocated in November, when Damian Green and Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith attended the DUP's conference, with Smith giving a keynote address. The third such annual DUP reception at the Conservative conference took place in October 2018, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson addressing the DUP conference a month later. Prominent Conservative MPs such as Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, former International Development Secretary Priti Patel, Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, Defence Select Committee chair Julian Lewis, and European Research Group chair Jacob Rees-Mogg headlined various fundraising events for the DUP from 2017 onwards."]}, {"page": "Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster", "response": ["Steve Barclay took over the post from Michael Gove in the 2021 reshuffle.
