Where Swift had had classical authors and Tory authors sweeping the field of their whig and modern commentators, Cooke had \"moderns\" and whig authors defeating Alexander Pope and other \"tory\" authors. That same year, he published an essay in the Daily Journal examining the Thersites section of Pope's Iliad which showed many faults of translation. In 1726, he wrote The Bath, or, The Knights of the Bath. In 1728, Cooke demonstrated his command of Greek with the first translation of Hesiod into English, and he became known as \"Hesiod Cooke.\" The same year, he wrote an opera with John Mottley entitled Penelope."]}, {"page": "1739 in Great Britain", "response": ["* John Mottley's pseudonymous Joe Miller's Jests, or the Wits Vade-Mecum."]}, {"page": "King John and the Bishop", "response": ["*Penelope (1728) by Thomas Cooke and John Mottley, song begins \"How idle the Notion of Birth and of Blood!\""]}, {"page": "Thomas Baker (dramatist)", "response": ["Baker is said to have been the son of an eminent attorney of London, and is said to have been educated in Oxford.

According to this rather prejudiced authority, Baker 'was under disgrace' with his father, 'who allowed him a very scanty income,' and was compelled to retire into Worcestershire, where he lived as a schoolmaster and vicar until his death in 1749. His successor at Bolnhurst, John Jones, remarked in private papers that he was \"A man of strange turn, imperious and clamorous upon topics of no service towards the promoting of true religion in his parish, and not a little addicted to stiff and dividing principles\".M/s 39B101, Dr. Williams's Library He is reported to have 'died of that loathsome disorder, the morbus pediculosus.' His namesake, David Erskine Baker, in the Biographia Dramatica, undertakes at some length his defence. He states that a character named Maiden, introduced in Tunbridge Walks, the best-known comedy of Thomas Baker, was intended by the author for himself.

The dramatic authors are divided into two alphabetical categories, those who flourished before and those who flourished after 1660, and there are small medallion portraits engraved by N. Parr. At the end is an index of the titles of plays. The book was based for the most part on the \u2018English Dramatic Poets\u2019 (1691) of Gerard Langbaine the younger.
