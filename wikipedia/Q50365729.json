He spent the 1926\u201327 season in the reserve team as an understudy to Fred Mace, playing six matches in the Lancashire Combination. At the start of the following campaign, Warhurst was offered his first professional contract by Nelson following the departure of Mace to Macclesfield Town. He made his first senior appearance for the club on 24 September 1927 in the 2\u20131 win against Durham City at Seedhill, taking the place of John Stoneham who had kept goal in the first five games of the season.Dykes (2009), p. 81 Warhurst retained his starting place for the following two matches as Nelson suffered consecutive away defeats at Barrow and Wrexham, before being replaced by William Bossons for the visit of Chesterfield on 8 October 1927. He went on to make 31 league appearances during the 1927\u201328 campaign, keeping three clean sheets but conceding 102 goals. Nelson suffered several heavy defeats throughout the season, losing by eight goals against both Bradford City and Stockport County; their total of 136 goals conceded remains the second-highest ever in a Football League season."]}]}}
