With Robb away on international duty with the Scotland team, Harris made his debut on 29 October 1927 in a 5\u20131 win against Hamilton Academical in Division One. The Evening Telegraph was impressed: as was the Scotsman: His next outing, against Rangers at Ibrox some 18 months later when Robb was unavailable with a poisoned hand, was less auspicious. Attempting a punched clearance, he punched the ball into his own net instead. His defenders were unnerved, and Hibernian lost 3\u20130. In Robb's continued absence, Harris kept his place for the next five matches, taking his total for the club to seven."]}]}}
