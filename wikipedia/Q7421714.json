Recognising that, in historic times, opportunities for women as composers were (through unchallenged societal norms) far fewer, the work included a similar analysis considering the proportions of living composers programmed, but even within this sub-set of the data, the proportion of composers programmed who were women only reached 14.3%, far short of the near-parity that might be desired in these notionally more enlightened times, and only one third of Mohr-Pietsch's 40%."]}, {"page": "Mohr-Pietsch, Sara", "response": ["#redirectSara Mohr-Pietsch"]}, {"page": "2018 in classical music", "response": ["* 5 November \u2013 The Dartington International Summer School and Festival announces the appointment of Sara Mohr-Pietsch as its next artistic director, effective January 2019, with her first programmed season scheduled to occur in 2020."]}, {"page": "2018 in British music", "response": ["* 5 November \u2013 The Dartington International Summer School and Festival announces the appointment of Sara Mohr-Pietsch as its next artistic director, effective January 2019, with her first programmed season scheduled to occur in 2020."]}, {"page": "Timeline of BBC Radio 3", "response": ["**15 November \u2013 Sara Mohr-Pietsch presents Radio 3 Breakfast for the final time.

The work premiered at Hull Minster on 30 June 2017, with a second performance at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 July 2017; a recording of the work was released by NMC Records.
