Bean was sentenced to death in the Nevada gas chamber for the murder, but was taken off death row in 1970 and remains in the Nevada State Prison. This murder was sensationalized on in the September 1963 issue (25-31 August early sports edition) of The National Enquirer with the frontpage headline (and a grisly photo) as: \"I CUT OUT HER HEART & STOMPED ON IT\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Generoso Pope Jr.", "response": ["Pope acquired the New York Enquirer in 1952 for $75,000. The Enquirer purchase was supposedly made, in part, with a loan from Costello. In 1954, Pope revamped the format from a broadsheet to a tabloid, and renamed it The National Enquirer. Pope worked tirelessly throughout the 1950s and 1960s to increase the circulation of the Enquirer. In the late 50s and through to 1967, it was known for its gory and unsettling headlines and stories such as \"I Cut Out Her Heart and Stomped On It\" (Sept. 8, 1963, the true story of the April 1963 mutilation murder of former Olympic Skier Sonja McCaskie) & \"Mom Boiled Her Baby And Ate Her\" (1962). At this time the paper was sold on newsstands and drugstores only \u2014 as the gory headlines would not have been allowed in family supermarkets, etc. Pope stated he got the idea for the format and these gory stories from seeing people congregate around auto accidents. After 1967, Pope tempered the use of gory headlines so the tabloid could be sold in more family-friendly environments such as at supermarket check-out lines, which Henry Dormann paved the way for by visiting with supermarket executives. This new sales strategy proved to be a huge boon for sales; single-copy sales of some issues (e.g. Elvis in his coffin) peaked above six million in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1960 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|Sonja McCaskie"]}, {"page": "April 1963", "response": ["**Sonja McCaskie, 24, British skier and 1960 Olympics competitor, murdered\"Headless Body of Ex-Skier Found\", Miami News, April 6, 1963, p1; \"Blonde Ski Star Was Tortrued Before Killing\", Miami News, April 7, 1963, p1"]}, {"page": "Alpine skiing at the 1960 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's giant slalom", "response": ["| 40 ||align=left| Sonja McCaskie || align=left| || 2:06.1 ||  + 26.2"]}, {"page": "McCaskie", "response": ["*Sonja McCaskie (1939\u20131963), British alpine skier"]}]}}
