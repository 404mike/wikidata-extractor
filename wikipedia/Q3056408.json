Probably the most famous piece he commissioned was called 'Lancashire Blues' by Eric Spear for a new soap opera with the working title of 'Florizel Street'. The story goes that a tea lady named Agnes remarked that 'Florizel' sounded like a brand of disinfectant, so the name of the soap opera was changed. Since it first aired in 1960, the 'Lancashire Blues' chosen by Peter has become one of the Twentieth Century's most iconic theme tunes to what we now know as Coronation Street."]}, {"page": "Another Smash!!!", "response": ["# \"Meet Mister Callahan\" (Eric Spear) \u2013 2:20"]}, {"page": "1966 in British music", "response": ["*3 November \u2013 Eric Spear, film composer, 58"]}, {"page": "Meet Mr. Callaghan", "response": ["The play was notable for the theme music and score by Eric Spear which became a best-selling record for Les Paul.#5, Billboard"]}, {"page": "Spear (surname)", "response": ["*Eric Spear (1908\u20131966), English composer of film music", "*Walter Eric Spear (1921\u20132008), German physicist"]}, {"page": "1935 in British music", "response": ["*Eric Spear \u2013 Play Up the Band"]}]}}
