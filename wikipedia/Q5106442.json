A modest fee of \u00a3330 persuaded his home club, Leith Athletic to relinquish his services when he was demobilised from the armed forces. His appearance against Burnley was his third Cup Final.

In this period of renewed football attendances, Charlton became one of only thirteen English football teams to average over 40,000 as their attendance during a full season. The Valley was the largest football ground in the League, drawing crowds in excess of 70,000. However, in the 1950s little investment was made either for players or to The Valley, hampering the club's growth. In 1956, the then board undermined Jimmy Seed and asked for his resignation; Charlton were relegated the following year."]}, {"page": "Bill Robinson (English footballer)", "response": ["He officially joined Charlton Athletic, also of the First Division, in May 1946,.
