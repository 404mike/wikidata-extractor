Having embarked on a career as a photographer, in his thirties he began to find prominence for his pictures of the ballet, and was often found at the Sadler's Wells ballet company. After the war he concentrated on society and celebrity portraits.A friend of Prince Philip, he was appointed a Court Photographer to the British Royal Family, and took the official photographs for many occasions such as the wedding of Philip to Princess Elizabeth in 1947, the christenings of their children Charles and Anne and other occasions. Prince Philip put forward his name in 1953 to take the official photographs of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, but the Queen Mother preferred Cecil Beaton.The following year, he founded Baron Studios on Park Lane in Mayfair, taking commissioned portraits by photographers including Theodore Zichy and Rex Coleman mainly of leading businessmen. One notable sitter was Marilyn Monroe, whom he photographed in 1954, in an outdoor shoot in California. During the first year in his studio, Antony Armstrong-Jones was one of his assistants.Two years after founding his new venture, Nahum died at the age of 50. Baron Studios continued in business until 1974. The Studio's photograph collection was donated to the National Portrait Gallery in 1999.Nahum appears as a character in the Netflix production The Crown in Season 1, Episode 6, played by Julius D'Silva.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon", "response": ["After university, Armstrong-Jones began a career as a photographer in fashion, design and theatre. His stepmother had a friend who knew Baron the photographer; Baron visited Armstrong-Jones in his London flat, which doubled as his work studio. Baron, impressed, agreed to bring on Armstrong-Jones as an apprentice, first on a fee-paying basis but eventually, as his talent and skills became apparent to Baron, as a salaried associate.", "After his divorce from Princess Margaret, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Mary Lindsay-Hogg (n\u00e9e Davies), the former wife of Sir Michael Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 5th Baronet on 15 December 1978. Armstrong-Jones's youngest daughter, with Lucy Mary, is Lady Frances Armstrong-Jones, a designer and board member of the Snowdon Trust. She was born on 17 July 1979 and in 2006 married Rodolphe, Edler von Hofmannsthal, great-grandson of Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey and great-great-grandson of Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland. From 1976 until 1996, Snowdon also had a mistress, journalist Ann Hills. She died by suicide on 31 December 1996.", "On 16 November 1999 Lord Snowdon was created Baron Armstrong-Jones, of Nymans in the County of West Sussex. This was a life peerage given to him so that he could keep his seat in the House of Lords after the hereditary peers had been excluded. An offer of a life peerage was made to all hereditary peers of the first creation (those for whom a peerage was originally created, as opposed to those who inherited a peerage from an ancestor) at that time. The government of the day had expected Lord Snowdon to follow the example of members of the royal family and turn down his right to a life peerage. At the time, Labour MP Fraser Kemp said he was \"shocked and surprised that someone who achieved their position in the House of Lords by virtue of marriage should accept a seat in the reformed Lords\"."]}, {"page": "Baron (disambiguation)", "response": ["Baron is a title of nobility.", "Baron, The Baron or Barons may also refer to:", "* Barons, Alberta, Canada", "* Baron, Gard, France", "* Baron, Gironde, France", "* Baron, Oise, France", "* Baron, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire, France", "* Baron-sur-Odon, France", "* Baron, Allahabad, India", "* Baron Hotel, in Aleppo, Syria", "* Baron (name), people with the surname or given name Baron", "* Baron (photographer), Sterling Henry Nahum (1906\u20131956)", "* Baron of the Exchequer, a type of English judge", "* Birmingham Barons, a Minor League Baseball team", "* Cleveland Barons (disambiguation), several former ice hockey teams", "* Oklahoma City Barons, a former ice hockey team in the American Hockey League", "* Barons, the nickname of Brewton\u2013Parker College athletics teams", "* The Baron (novella), 1942 Portuguese novella by Branquinho da Fonseca", "* The Baron (TV series), a mid-1960s British television series", "* The Baron (album), 1981 album by American country singer Johnny Cash", "** \"The Baron\" (song), 1981 song by Johnny Cash", "* The Baron (film), a 2011 Portuguese film based on the novella", "* The Barons, a 2009 Belgian film", "* Baron, a fictional kingdom in the game Final Fantasy IV", "* Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, a character in The Cat Returns", "* Beechcraft Baron, an aircraft", "* Baron Services, a weather technology company", "* Baron convention, in the game of contract bridge", "* The Baron (horse), an Irish thoroughbred racehorse of the mid-19th century", "* Baron, a cut of beef comprising a double sirloin joined at the backbone", "* Baron Kriminel, a spirit in the Gu\u00e9d\u00e9 family in Haitian Vodou", "* Battlin' Baron, the mascot of Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School", "* Barony (disambiguation)", "* Le Baron (disambiguation) (also spelled le Baron and LeBaron)", "* Baroness (disambiguation)", "* Baronett (disambiguation)", "* Red Baron (disambiguation)", "* Black Baron (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Peter Baker (British politician)", "response": ["He was a frequent visitor at the \"Thursday Club\",\"My Testament\", p. 243. a raffish luncheon club located at Wheeler's oyster bar, in Old Compton Street, London, a men's eating and drinking group dedicated to \"Absolute Inconsequence\";The Thursday club's spirit was that friends would meet once a week, no issues of importance would be allowed, no international question would be solved, eat well, tell stories and swap reminiscences. other members included the actors David Niven, James Robertson Justice and Peter Ustinov, the future Duke of Edinburgh, the intelligence officer Kim Philby, celebrity photographer Stirling Henry Nahum, (known as Baron) and Baker's friend, Colonel Sean Fielding, editor of Tatler magazine and later of the Daily Express.
