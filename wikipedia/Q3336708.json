Following the release of Batman Begins, Nolan started up the project again, negotiating with Jackman and Bale in October 2005. While the screenplay was still being written, production designer Nathan Crowley began the set design process in Nolan's garage, employing a \"visual script\" consisting of scale models, images, drawings, and notes.

Production designer Nathan Crowley, who designed the Tumbler for Batman Begins, designed six models (built by special effects supervisor Chris Corbould) for use in the film's production, because of necessary crash scenes and possible accidents. Crowley built a prototype in Nolan's garage, before six months of safety tests were conducted. The Batpod is steered by shoulder instead of hand, and the rider's arms are protected by sleeve-like shields. The bike has  front and rear tires, and is made to appear as if it is armed with grappling hooks, cannons, and machine guns. The engines are located in the hubs of the wheels, which are set 3\u00bdfeet (1,067mm) apart on either side of the tank. The rider lies belly down on the tank, which can move up and down to dodge any incoming gunfire that Batman may encounter. Stuntman Jean-Pierre Goy doubled for Christian Bale during the riding sequences in The Dark Knight. The Batpod was highly unstable for riding, and Goy was the only stuntman who could manage to balance the bike, even commenting that he had to \"nearly un-learn how to ride a motorcycle\" to manage riding the Batpod. Bale did insist on doing shots on the Batpod himself, but was prohibited by the team fearing his safety.", "Designers improved on the design of the Batsuit from Batman Begins, adding wide elastic banding to help bind the costume to Bale, and suggest more sophisticated technology. It was constructed from 200 individual pieces of rubber, fiberglass, metallic mesh, and nylon. The new cowl was modeled after a motorcycle helmet and separated from the neck piece, allowing Bale to turn his head left and right and nod up and down. The cowl is equipped to show white lenses over the eyes when the character turns on his sonar detection, which gives Batman the white-eyed look from the comics and animation. The gauntlets have retractable razors which can be fired. Though the new costume is eight pounds heavier, Bale found it more comfortable and not as hot to wear. The depiction of Gotham City is less gritty than in Batman Begins. \"I've tried to unclutter the Gotham we created on the last film\", said production designer Nathan Crowley. \"Gotham is in chaos.

Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air.

", "Interstellar features three spacecraft\u2014the Ranger, the Endurance, and the Lander. The Ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of twelve capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock. Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" Lastly, the Lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"", "The Ranger, Endurance, and Lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname \"maxatures\" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over , while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned  and over , respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig. New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots."]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| Batman Begins || Nathan Crowley", "| The Dark Knight || Nathan Crowley and Peter Lando", "| Interstellar || Nathan Crowley and Gary Fettis", "| Dunkirk || Nathan Crowley and Gary Fettis", "| First Man || Nathan Crowley and Kathy Lucas"]}, {"page": "List of invitees for AMPAS Membership (2007)", "response": ["*Nathan Crowley - The Prestige, Batman Begins"]}, {"page": "81st Academy Awards", "response": ["** The Dark Knight\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Nathan Crowley; Set Decoration: Peter Lando"]}, {"page": "ADG Excellence in Production Design Awards", "response": ["*2008: The Dark Knight by production designer Nathan Crowley", "*2020: Tenet by production designer Nathan Crowley", "* 2016: Westworld (for \"The Original\") by production designer Nathan Crowley"]}, {"page": "Satellite Award for Best Art Direction and Production Design", "response": ["|Public Enemies || Nathan Crowley, Patrick Lumb, William Ladd Skinner", "| The Dark Knight Rises || James Hambidge, Kevin Kavanaugh, Naaman Marshall, and Nathan Crowley", "| Dunkirk || Nathan Crowley", "| First Man || Nathan Crowley"]}, {"page": "2008 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards", "response": ["**Runner-up: Nathan Crowley \u2013 The Dark Knight"]}, {"page": "62nd British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* The Dark Knight \u2013 Nathan Crowley and Peter Lando"]}, {"page": "Art Directors Guild Awards 2008", "response": ["*Nathan Crowley \u2013 The Dark Knight"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["| Nathan Crowley", "| Nathan Crowley", "| Nathan Crowley", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Nathan Crowley", "| Nathan Crowley"]}, {"page": "The Dark Knight Rises", "response": ["On February 9, 2010, it was announced that Nolan had \"cracked\" the story and was committed to return to the project.

Chris Nolan said that his brother's original draft was about 400 pages.

The final version of the Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery.
