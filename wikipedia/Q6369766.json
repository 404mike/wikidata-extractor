He did not meet his biological father until 2001. Kay's identical twin, David, died a few weeks after the two were born. Kay said in a 2010 interview that his mother raised him largely alone, which gave him \"an itinerant childhood\", half of which he spent \"living in rural Suffolk and rural Devon\". According to a 1997 article in the Lancashire Evening Telegraph, he moved to Manchester with his mother and step-father Mervyn Kay as a youngster. He often accompanied his mother at her performances, and later attended Oakham School in Oakham. At the age of 15, he was homeless and turned to small crimes to survive; he returned home after a false arrest and near-death experience, working as a break-dancer and soon pursuing a career in music. It was widely reported that he failed an audition to become a singer for the Brand New Heavies prior to forming his own band, though the Brand New Heavies denied the claim.", "James Royal, often described as Kay's stepfather, is his mother's former manager with whom she had a relationship during Kay's childhood years.
