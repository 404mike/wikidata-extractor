Riddler had used a Lazarus Pit to cure himself of terminal brain cancer, and during his time in the pit, deduced Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne. Having first approached Thomas Elliot with a cure for his mother's disease (the Lazarus Pit), the Riddler had instead allied with Elliot against Wayne. Riddler was also the only villain who Batman did not believe acted in an unusual way during the entire saga; the robbery Batman foiled was fairly typical of Riddler at the time. The Riddler also tells him that he and Elliot referred to the plot as the \"Hush\" plot. He further reveals that he knows Batman's identity as Wayne, but Batman is unfazed because a riddle which everyone knows the answer to would be worthless to Riddler. In addition, Batman warns that if Riddler reveals his secrets, it exposes Riddler as the culprit who used Ra's al Ghul's Lazarus Pit, who would then send the League of Assassins after him."]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["*Arthur Wynne: Inventor of the Crossword puzzle."]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 1913: The crossword puzzle invented by Liverpool-born Arthur Wynne (1871\u20131945)."]}, {"page": "Margaret Farrar", "response": ["Her career in crossword puzzles began at the New York World in 1921.A Crossword Hall of Famer: Margaret Farrar, by Helene Hovanec; in CROSSW RD MAGAZINE, volume II, no. 6, November/December 1992 She had been hired as the secretary to the editor of the Sunday edition of the New York World; he eventually assigned her to assist crossword inventor Arthur Wynne, who was overloaded with reader submissions of puzzles\u00a0\u2013 and with complaints about flawed puzzles.
