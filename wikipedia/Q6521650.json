Price was described in the local press as \"an inside-left of the studious type\", whose passes were usually well-judged.

This remains Southampton's highest margin of victory in a Football League match. Despite this early success, Johnson was unable to maintain any consistent form, and after nine matches he lost his place back to Andrews. He was recalled to the team in March, following the sale of Fred Foxall to Birmingham as part of a four-player exchange deal, but after two matches he was dropped in favour of Ken Boyes.
