After a pilot, the show debuted in 2008 with moderate ratings but grew over the course of the three series, doubling its ratings each series because of its cult following. The third series got viewing figures of 1.5 million across the week and was the second most watched show on BBC iPlayer. When BBC Three controller Danny Cohen left the channel, new controller Zai Bennett cancelled several comedies, including How Not to Live Your Life.", "In 2006, Clark was commissioned to write two short comedies for Paramount Comedy 1 \u2013 Dan Clark's Guide to Dating and Dan Clark's Guide to Working. Clark was the main character in both shows, and Isabel Fay appeared in Dan Clark's Guide to Dating, which was shown as ten one-minute clips on the channel, with lists of ten things people shouldn't do on a date, such as \"Ten things you shouldn't wear on a date\". The clips began to appear on the Internet and the BBC approached him about doing a 30-minute show in the same format. The result was the pilot for How Not to Live Your Life, using the same style of short clips within a traditional sitcom. The pilot was filmed in a real house in London and first aired on BBC Three on 27 September 2007.", "On 2 November 2009, BBC Three recommissioned the show for a third series.  This was confirmed by Dan Clark on both his Twitter and Facebook page, and on 29 September 2010, Dan Clark posted on his official Twitter page that the third series was scheduled to be aired in the beginning of November.", "Dan Clark has been heard saying to fans after his recent live shows that they are unsure as to whether there will be a fourth series.", "* Donald \"Don\" Danbury (Dan Clark) \u2013 (2007\u20132011) \u2013 Don is the protagonist.

Okay, don't pity her too much, because she's drop dead gorgeous and clearly in demand as an actor. But it must have been galling to get the second lead in sitcom How Not to Live Your Life, only to discover that the full extent of your contribution would be to look pretty and provide a sensible foil to the show's writer/star Dan Clark. Would it have killed Clark to throw the show's only female character the occasional funny line to deliver? This grump notwithstanding, I rather like How Not to Live Your Life. Clark's unorthodox delivery, combined with Don's almost wilful unloveability, takes some getting used to, but this is consistently amusing, frequently hilarious and totally addictive.\""]}, {"page": "The Secret Policeman's Ball 2008", "response": ["*Dan Clark"]}, {"page": "Dan Clark (disambiguation)", "response": ["Dan Clark (born 1976) is an English actor, stand-up comedian, scriptwriter and television director.", "Dan Clark may also refer to:", "*Dan Clark (ice hockey) (born 1957), Canadian hockey player ", "*Dan Clark (motivational speaker) (born 1955), American author, CEO, and motivational teacher", "*Dan Clark (Canadian football) (born 1988), Canadian football offensive lineman", "*Dan Clarke (born 1983), British auto racing driver"]}, {"page": "The Mr. Potato Head Show", "response": ["The Mr. Potato Head Show was developed by Dan Clark and Doug Langdale.
