Born in Watford, he played primarily as a striker during his amateur career, but later switched to become a goalkeeper. After playing for Leavesden Mental Hospital's football team, as well as for Hertfordshire, Williams joined Watford as an amateur in 1910, turning professional in 1914. During his first season as a professional, Watford won the 1914\u20131915 Southern Football League title. League football was then interrupted for four seasons due to the First World War. Following its resumption in 1919, Williams again played a part as Watford finished runners up to Portsmouth on goal average. Watford entered the Football League the following season, and Williams stayed with the club for a further six seasons. He holds the record for the most Watford appearances by a goalkeeper; 83 in the Southern League, 240 in the Football League, 17 in the FA Cup and one in the Southern Charity Cup. He stayed at Watford until 1926, before moving to Brighton & Hove Albion on a free transfer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry Kent (footballer)", "response": ["Kent was forced to sell a number of players that summer, but with a side based around a number of local players (including Skilly Williams, Charlie White, and brothers Fred and Val Gregory) he led the club to the Southern League Championship in 1914\u201315."]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Williams", "response": ["*Skilly Williams (1890\u20131959), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Watford F.C. players", "response": ["Many of Watford's individual records are held by former centre forward Luther Blissett.
