The relaunch occurred at midnight on 17 January 2000, and was accompanied by the station moving from Oxford Street to a new studio at Hatfields on the South Bank of the River Thames. Now mainly dedicated to sport, the programming lineup was drastically altered, beginning with The Sports Breakfast show; this was followed by a mid-morning motoring show called The Car Guys, with further sports programming in the afternoon and evening. Almost all the station's talk show presenters were axed at the time, including The Big Boys Breakfast with David Banks and Nick Ferrari, with only James Whale, Ian Collins and Mike Dickin surviving. To complement its new format, Talksport purchased the rights to broadcast Manchester United, Arsenal and Newcastle in the UEFA Champions League, the FA Cup, England football internationals, UEFA Cup, England's winter cricket tours to South Africa, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, and India, British & Irish Lions tours to South Africa and New Zealand, and rights to the Super League, Rugby League World Cup, and world title boxing Fights."]}, {"page": "Charlie Wolf", "response": ["He is a regular guest on the News panel on LBC with former talkSPORT presenter Ian Collins."]}, {"page": "Ian Collins", "response": ["Ian Collins may refer to:", "* Ian Collins (footballer) (born 1942), Australian businessman and former Australian rules footballer", "* Ian Collins (radio presenter) (born 1966), UK radio presenter", "* Ian Collins (soccer) (born 1963), soccer coach at the University of Kentucky", "* Ian Collins (swimmer) (born 1962), British swimmer", "* Ian Collins (tennis) (1903\u20131975), British tennis player from the 1920s and 1930s"]}, {"page": "Collins (surname)", "response": ["*Ian Collins (disambiguation), multiple people, one of several people including:", "**Ian Collins (tennis) (1903\u20131975), British tennis player from the 1920s and 1930s", "**Ian Collins (footballer) (born 1942), Australian businessman and former Australian rules footballer", "**Ian Collins (radio presenter) (born 1956), UK radio presenter", "**Ian Collins (soccer) (born 1963), American soccer coach at the University of Kentucky"]}, {"page": "Nathan Morley", "response": ["Morley has been a regular voice on LBC radio in London since 2001, where he joins Steve Allen on Thursday mornings; he also reports for other LBC programmes.
