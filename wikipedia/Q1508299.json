Like his missionary forebear Karl G\u00fctzlaff and contemporary William Chalmers Burns, Taylor was convinced that Chinese clothing should be worn when engaged in missionary work in inland China. On 3 October 1865, Taylor sent John and Anne Stevenson and George Stott to China, where they arrived on February 6, 1866. Including the five missionaries previously sent to Ningbo -James Joseph Meadows, Jean Notman, Stephen Paul Barchet, and George and Anne Crombie, these eight were already in China when Taylor returned in 1866. On 26 May of that year, Taylor accompanied the largest group of missionaries that had ever sailed to China on the Lammermuir. There were 16 missionaries as well as Hudson, his wife, Maria and their 4 children that became known as the Lammermuir Party.

She wanted to be a missionary in China after hearing Hudson Taylor speak in Glasgow. She was accepted to go until she fell ill. When the large Lammermuir Party sailed she was left behind on the dock. The opportunity passed her by and she was moved to establish a more domestic mission to the red light districts of Glasgow. She was busy with this when a letter arrived from a young Scot George Stott who she had met. He proposed marriage to her, by mail, and she accepted. George was unusual as he had been chosen as a China Inland Mission (i.e. non denominational) missionary despite having lost a leg. He had planned to take another woman to China as his wife, but her parents disapproved of her going to China."]}]}}
