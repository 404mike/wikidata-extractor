The business remains there to this day.  The figures are called Groggs after the type of clay that was originally used to make them.", "In 2001 the founder of the business and the inventor of the Groggs, John Hughes, was presented with the Chancellor's medal from the University of Glamorgan in recognition of his contribution to Welsh life.
