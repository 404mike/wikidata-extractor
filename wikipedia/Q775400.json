In the 1860s everyone was scratching their heads about that, and several scientists moved towards rather similar answers. The man who solved the problem most triumphantly was a young Russian called Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, who visited the salt mine at Wieliczka in 1859.\"  The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table."]}, {"page": "Gastroenterology", "response": ["* In 1823, William Prout discovered that stomach juices contain hydrochloric acid.Prout, W.

This was later rejected in the 1820s and 30s following more refined measurements of atomic mass, notably by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius, which revealed in particular that the atomic mass of chlorine was 35.45, which was incompatible with the hypothesis. Since the 1920s this discrepancy has been explained by the presence of isotopes; the atomic mass of any isotope is very close to satisfying the whole number rule, with the mass defect caused by differing binding energies being significantly smaller."]}, {"page": "Natural theology", "response": ["#Chemistry, Meteorology, and the Function of Digestion, considered with reference to Natural Theology, by William Prout, M.D.", "#Chemistry, Meteorology, and the Function of Digestion, considered with reference to Natural Theology, by William Prout, M.D."]}, {"page": "Proton", "response": ["The concept of a hydrogen-like particle as a constituent of other atoms was developed over a long period.

In 1773, Hilaire Rouelle obtained crystals containing urea from human urine by evaporating it and treating it with alcohol in successive filtrations.Rouelle (1773) \"Observations sur l'urine humaine, & sur celle de vache & de cheval, compar\u00e9es ensemble\" (Observations on human urine and on that of the cow and horse, compared to each other), Journal de M\u00e9decine, de Chirurgie et de Pharmacie, 40 : 451\u2013468.  Rouelle describes the procedure he used to separate urea from urine on pages 454\u2013455. This method was aided by Carl Wilhelm Scheele's discovery that urine treated by concentrated nitric acid precipitated crystals. Antoine Fran\u00e7ois, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin discovered in 1799 that the nitrated crystals were identical to Rouelle's substance and invented the term \"urea.\"Fourcroy and Vauquelin (1799) \"Extrait d\u2019un premier m\u00e9moire des cit.

On page 91, urea is again named \"ur\u00e9e\". Berzelius made further improvements to its purification and finally William Prout, in 1817, succeeded in obtaining and determining the chemical composition of the pure substance. In the evolved procedure, urea was precipitated as urea nitrate by adding strong nitric acid to urine. To purify the resulting crystals, they were dissolved in boiling water with charcoal and filtered. After cooling, pure crystals of urea nitrate form. To reconstitute the urea from the nitrate, the crystals are dissolved in warm water, and barium carbonate added. The water is then evaporated and anhydrous alcohol added to extract the urea.

Thomson", "response": ["Several scientists, such as William Prout and Norman Lockyer, had suggested that atoms were built up from a more fundamental unit, but they envisioned this unit to be the size of the smallest atom, hydrogen. Thomson in 1897 was the first to suggest that one of the fundamental units was more than 1,000 times smaller than an atom, suggesting the subatomic particle now known as the electron. Thomson discovered this through his explorations on the properties of cathode rays. Thomson made his suggestion on 30 April 1897 following his discovery that cathode rays (at the time known as Lenard rays) could travel much further through air than expected for an atom-sized particle. He estimated the mass of cathode rays by measuring the heat generated when the rays hit a thermal junction and comparing this with the magnetic deflection of the rays. His experiments suggested not only that cathode rays were over 1,000 times lighter than the hydrogen atom, but also that their mass was the same in whichever type of atom they came from. He concluded that the rays were composed of very light, negatively charged particles which were a universal building block of atoms. He called the particles \"corpuscles\", but later scientists preferred the name electron which had been suggested by George Johnstone Stoney in 1891, prior to Thomson's actual discovery."]}, {"page": "Human nutrition", "response": ["In 1816, Fran\u00e7ois Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived\u00a0\u2013 identifying protein as an essential dietary component.Gratzer 2005, pp. 73\u201374.
